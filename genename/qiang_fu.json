        "abstract": "A crystallizable polymer, poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), was used as new modifier to tailor the toughness of isotactic polypropylene (iPP). An optimum performance was achieved at a medium PEO content of 15 wt% where the toughness was enhanced by 300%, while the strength only decreased slightly. To elucidate the origin of toughening in the iPP/PEO blends, various crystallographic and morphological experiments including X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy and calorimetry were adopted to explore the dependences of polymorphic composition and crystallized morphology on PEO content. When the PEO content is less than 15 wt%, the dispersed PEO cannot crystallize, and these non-crystalline PEO microspheres are embedded in both \u03b1- and \u03b2-form iPP spherulites, which is mainly responsible for the toughening. In contrast, when the PEO content is higher than 15 wt%, the PEO phase becomes crystallizable, and significant phase segregation takes place, resulting in a marked deterioration in mechanical properties.

        "abstract": "As a long term project aiming at engineering plastics based on polypropylene (PP), in this work, we report the effect of ethylene-cellulose (EC) on the orientation and relaxation of PP obtained via dynamic packing injection molding (DPIM). 2d-WAXD results showed that PP with a highly oriented structure and a shish-kebab structure were achieved by DIPM, leading to an increase of tensile strength from 35.0 MPa to 48.6 MPa. The degree of orientation of PP was increased by adding only 1% of EC, resulting in a further increase of tensile strength from 48.6 MPa to 53.8 MPa. Shish was found to exist not only in the oriented layer but also in the core of the sample after adding EC, as evidenced by DSC result. This was understood as due to the overall decrease of viscosity by the addition of EC, thus an increasing of shear rate. Higher shear rate can favor the orientation of molecules and continuous growth of shish structure, resulting in a change of shish distribution along the sample thickness. On the other hand, the relaxation mode of shish in the melt re- crystallization of PP is also greatly affected by the presence of EC. A retarded relaxation of PP macromolecules was seen. Even more, SEM results showed that EC could form the short fibers in PP matrix along the shear flow direction. Compared with the morphology obtained by conventional injection molding, a much better dispersion and easy break-up of EC in PP matrix were observed for samples obtained by dynamic packing injection molding.",

Before occurrence of nucleation/crystallization, a conformationally ordered phase, which consists of significant amounts of long 31 helices with 14 monomeric units, has been identified for the first time. More importantly, it was found that the long-ordering helices could play a more important role than short ones for the confined crystallization.

        "abstract": "The introduction of carbon nanotubes in a polymer matrix can markedly improve its mechanical properties and electrical conductivity, and much effort has been devoted to achieve homogeneous dispersions of carbon nanotubes in various polymers. Our group previously performed successfully fluorine-graftedmodification on the sidewalls of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), using homemade equipment for CF4 plasma irradiation. As a continuation of our previous work, in the present study CF4 plasma-treated MWCNTs (F-MWCNTs) were used as a nanofiller with poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), which is a practical example of the application of such F-MWCNTs to prepare polyester/MWCNTs nanocomposites with ideal nanoscale structure and excellent properties. As confirmed from scanning electron microscopy observations, the F-MWCNTs could easily be homogeneously dispersed in the PET matrix during the in situ polymerization preparation process. It was found that a very low content of F-MWCNTs dramatically altered the crystallization behavior and mechanical properties of the nanocomposites. For example, a 15 {ring operator}C increase in crystallization temperature was achieved by adding only 0.01 wt% F-MWCNTs, implying that the well-dispersed F-MWCNTs act as highly effective nucleating agents to initiate PET crystallization at high temperature. Meanwhile, an abnormal phenomenon was found in that the melt point of the nanocomposites is lower than that of the pure PET. The mechanism of the tailoring of the properties of PET resin by incorporation of F-MWCNTs is discussed, based on structure-property relationships. The good dispersion of the F-MWCNTs and strong interfacial interaction between matrix and nanofiller are responsible for the improvement in mechanical properties and high nucleating efficiency. The abnormal melting behavior is attributed to the recrystallization transition of PET occurring at the early stage of crystal melting being retarded on incorporation of F-MWCNTs. \u00a9 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.",

However, its efficiency is usually low due to the limitation of thermal reduction temperature used. In this paper, well dispersion of graphene oxide (GO) in polycarbonate (PC) matrix was firstly prepared via solvent-exchange and coagulation. Then the GO was in situ thermal reduced efficiently within a few minutes in PC solid matrix, taking the advantage of PC processing at high temperature (280\u00b0C). The presence of well-dispersed isolated reduced graphene oxide (RGO) single sheets in the PC matrix had been demonstrated. The reduction of graphene oxide was well confirmed. As a result, the nanocomposites exhibit a low percolation threshold of \u223c0.21 vol% and a conductivity of 0.041 S m-1 at a RGO content of 1.09 vol%. Meanwhile, the mechanical properties and thermal stability of PC are also significantly enhanced by adding RGO. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "In this work, the synergistic effects of \u03b2-modification and impact polypropylene copolymer (IPC) on brittle-ductile (B-D) transition behavior of polypropylene random copolymer (PPR) have been investigated. It is interesting to find that adding both IPC and \u03b2-nucleating agent into PPR has three effects: (i) leading to a significant enhancement in \u03b2-crystallization capability of PPR, (ii) contributing to the shift of B-D transition to lower temperatures, (iii) increasing the B-D transition rate. The reason for these changes can be interpreted from the following two aspects. On one hand, the transition of crystalline structure from \u03b1-form to \u03b2-form reduces the plastic resistance of PPR matrix, thus causing the initiation of matrix shear yielding much easier during the impact process. On the other hand, the well dispersed rubbery phase in IPC with high molecular mobility at relatively low temperatures is beneficial to the shear yielding of PPR matrix and, subsequently, the great improvement in impact toughness of the ternary blends.

        "abstract": "In this work, recycled Poly(ethylene glycol-co-cyclohexane-1,4-dimethanol terephthalate) plastic (PETG) was used to enhance the properties and lower the cost of polypropylene(PP). In order to adjust the interfacial adhesion, three triblock copolymers having the same styrene block at two ends but different block in the middle, were used a the compatibilizers, namely, styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene (SEBS), styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS). The ratio of PP to PETG was fixed at 70/30 and the relationship between interfacial adhesion and mechanical properties was investigated. The addition of SIS caused a considerable increase in Izod impact toughness, but only slightly improved toughness was observed for blends compatibilized with SEBS. The effect of SBS on improving the impact toughness lied in between that of SIS and SEBS. SEM micrographs showed that PETG forms a fibrillar-like structure for all the uncompatibilized and compatibilized blends, and the blends compatibilized with SBS have smallest domain size, the blends compatibilized with SEBS have largest domain size, while the ones compatibilized with SIS show a moderate domain size. Results from melt rheometry and SEM observation together with work of interfacial adhesion, indicated a strongest interfacial adhesion in blends compatibilized with SBS, poorest in blends compatibilized with SEBS, and moderate in blends compatibilized with SIS. It is very interesting to found that the much improved impact strength was not observed in the blends with the strongest interfacial adhesion but achieved in the blend with moderate interfacial adhesion. Investigation on the impact fractured surface revealed an easier debonding of fibril from matrix and consequently drawn out of matrix in blends compatibilized by SIS with moderate interfacial adhesion, which was considered as the main reason for the much improved impact toughness in this system. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Irradiation of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) with a dose of 150 kGy by an electron beam can effectively increase the entanglement density in the amorphous phase and has little influence on the properties of the crystalline phase, which provides examples to comparatively investigate the role of lamellar coupling and entanglement density in determining the strain-hardening effect in semicrystalline polymers. The strain-hardening modulus, deduced from the Haward plots of true stress-strain curves, is inversely temperature-dependent and has a sharp transition around 65 degrees C that corresponds to the mechanical alphaI-process of the crystalline phase for both nonirradiated and irradiated samples, irrespective of the entanglement density in the amorphous phase. Lamellar coupling takes more effect in determining the strain-hardening behavior before the mechanical alphaI-process is activated. With further increasing temperature, lamellar coupling becomes weaker and the role of the entangled amorphous phase is gradually presented. However, the same temperature dependence of the strain-hardening modulus in both nonirradiated and irradiated samples indicates that the strain-hardening behavior in semicrystalline polymer is mostly determined by lamellar coupling rather than by entanglement density.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we attempted to elucidate the Brittle-ductile transition (BDT) behavior of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)/poly(ethylene-octene) (POE) blends under different situations of interfacial compatibility and test temperature. To modulate the compatibility between PET and PEO, maleic anhydride grafted POE (mPOE) was selected as compatibilizer. Three kinds of elastomeric additives, 100 % POE, mPOE/POE (15/85 w/w), and 100 % mPOE, were blended with PET, resulting in three compatibility situations, namely, poor, moderate, and strong interfacial adhesion, respectively. The impact toughness as a function of elastomer content was measured under different interfacial adhesions and test temperature, and microscopic morphology was revealed by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The results indicated that the interfacial adhesion determines the fashion of microvoiding and even the matrix shear yielding deformation, which will significantly affect the BDT behavior and its response to test temperature. Our study provides not only an effective route to prepare supertoughened PET blends (improved for 20 folds as comparing to the neat PET), but also a fresh insight into the importance of interfacial adhesion on the toughening of thermoplastic/elastomer system. ? 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

In this study, we prepared the polypropylene and SiO 2-MgO-CaO whisker (SMCW) composite fibers by melt-spun technology. The structure-property relationship of the PP/SMCW composite fibers was investigated by scanning electron microscopy, polarizing light microscopy, differential scanning calorimeter, the polarized Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and tensile test. Two different interfacial crystalline structures were observed by adopting two drawn ratios - shish-calabash structure obtained at the low drawn ratio and transcrystalline (TC) structure obtained at the high drawn ratio. Remarkable reinforcement of the fibers was realized for the composite fibers prepared at high drawn ratio, compared with that obtained at the low drawn ratio. It was deduced that the formation of transcrystalline structure could result in a better interfacial interaction than shish-calabash structure, and could be one of the most important reasons for the large improvement of tensile properties of composite fibers fabricated at high drawn ratio. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Most of work on polymer/layered silicate nanocomposites (PLSN) focused on the importance of the chemistry used to modify the surface of the clay, usually montmorillonite (MMT) and characterization of the nano-scale structure obtained in the last decade. The role and importance of processing has been paid attention only recently. Our purpose of this study is to determine the effect of the chemistry and shear on the dispersion of clay in polymer matrix via dynamic packing injection molding (DPIM), in which the melt is firstly injected into the mold then forced to move repeatedly in a chamber by two pistons that moved reversibly with the same frequency as the solidification progressively occurs from the mold wall to the molding core part. A special orientation region between the skin region and the core region is produced via imposing the reversible shear effect during the cooling of the melt. The initial MMT and organic modified MMT (abbreviated as OMMT) were directly injection molded with powdered iPP in the DPIM without pre-extrusion. Without shearing, only an intercalated structure was obtained through organic modification and the diameter of OMMT particles has a significant reduction compared to the initial MMT. Under the effect of shear, however, an intercalated morphology in the oriented region and an exfoliated morphology in the core region can be achieved. Our result suggests that both the chemistry and shear are important to determine the dispersion of clay in polymer matrix. PP/clay nanocomposites with excellent impact strength can be prepared via simple one step, direct injection molding without a conventional pre-extrusion, by dynamic packing injection molding. The observed change of impact strength could be related to the local hierarchical structure developed during the processing.",

Effects of the relative concentration of PS in polymer solution on the surface phase separation and dewetting feature size of the blend films were systematically studied. Due to the coupling of phase separation, dewetting, and crystallization of the blend films with the evaporation of solvent during spin-coating, different size of PS islands decorated with various PCL crystal structures including spherulite-like, flat-on individual lamellae, and flat-on dendritic crystal were obtained in the blend films by changing the film composition. The average distance of PS islands was shown to increase with the relative concentration of PS in casting solution. For a given ratio of PS/PCL, the feature size of PS appeared to increase linearly with the square of PS concentration while the PCL concentration only determined the crystal morphology of the blend films with no influence on the upper PS domain features. This is explained in terms of vertical phase separation and spinodal dewetting of the PS rich layer from the underlying PCL rich layer, leading to the upper PS dewetting process and the underlying PCL crystalline process to be mutually independent.",

Interestingly, three different structures can be formed in the IPC samples by adding NA or tuning Tp. A well-defined core-shell structure is obtained in samples with \u03b1-NA or without NA prepared at all Tp. A developing multilayered structure is mainly formed at high Tp with added \u03b2-NA, while an incomplete phase separation structure with interpenetrating chains is the dominant structure for IPC samples prepared at low Tp with added \u03b2-NA. In this case, because of the synergistic effect between phase morphology and relatively high \u03b2-form crystal content, the chain interaction among the components and chain mobility of the amorphous portion of IPC are distinctly improved, resulting in a largely improved toughness under 0 \u00b0C. This improvement in toughness is very important for applications. \u00a9 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.",

        "abstract": "In this study, the effects of \u03b1- and \u03b2-nucleating agents (\u03b1-NA and \u03b2-NA) on the toughening behavior of impact polypropylene copolymer were ascertained with respect to three test temperatures (23, 0 and -15 \u00b0C). The addition of \u03b1-NA impacted the toughness slightly for all test temperatures. However, the tendency of impact strength vs. \u03b2-NA content at 0 \u00b0C significantly differs from that of the other two temperatures. Importantly, a close correlation between toughness at 0 \u00b0C and chain mobility of the amorphous portion has been well revealed for the first time by achieving a linearly fitting between impact strength at 0 \u00b0C and \u03b2-relaxation peak intensity in DMA spectrum. A comparative investigation between the situations containing \u03b1-NA or \u03b2-NA offers new insights into the physical origin of the toughening behavior for a multiphase multicomponent polyolefin system. The chain mobility of matrix amorphous portion plays a dominant role on toughening. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "In this work, a single ramie fiber was firstly treated with various surface modification agents including alkali, silane, maleic anhydride and acetic anhydride. Then single fiber fragmentation was carried out to evaluate the interfacial interaction between the fiber and poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) matrix by means of interfacial shear strength (IFSS). The highest IFSS was found for the fiber treated with alkali. In this simple way, alkali was easily selected as a good surface modification agent for the preparation of PBS/ramie fibers biocomposites. In order to verify that the single fiber fragmentation is an effective method for the selection of a good surface modification agent, the interfacial interaction and mechanical properties of the prepared PBS/alkali treated ramie fibers composites were investigated. It was found that alkali treated ramie fibers could be well dispersed and had better interfacial adhesion with the matrix than untreated fibers, as indicated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The tensile strength and modulus of PBS were greatly increased by adding the alkali treated fibers, while only a slight increase of tensile strength and modulus was observed for those compounded with untreated fibers. These results indicate that alkali is indeed a good coupling agent for the improvement of the interfacial strength of the composites, which is well consistent with that obtained via the IFSS measurement. Therefore, single fiber fragmentation test can be used as an effective and simple method to evaluate the surface modification and interfacial enhancement as well. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

In this work, in order to explore the possibility to enhance the interfacial interaction via interfacial crystallization of polymer matrix onto the filler surface, interfacial crystallization structure and mechanical properties of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE)/whisker composites were investigated. The composites were firstly prepared by melt compounding, followed by processing in both traditional and dynamic injection molding. DSC, WAXD, SEM were used to characterize the interfacial crystallization structure. And the mechanical properties were measured by tensile testing. An imperfect shish-calabash structure, with whisker served as shish, and irregular LLDPE spherulite as imperfect calabash, was formed during common injection molding processing. Such a structure was considered as the main reason for the strong interfacial adhesion and the obviously improved tensile strength and modulus. Furthermore, introducing shear could cause the formation of relatively perfect shish-calabash structure, leading to the stronger interfacial adhesion. \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "In order to improve the compatibility and the mechanical properties of Polyamide1010 and Polypropylene(PA1010/PP)blends, a novel reactive compatibilizer ethylene-butylacrylate-glycidyl methacrylate terpolymer(PTW) was used to compatibilize the blends. The compatibilizing effect of PTW on PA1010/PP blends was investigated by means of scaning electron microscopy(SEM), Fourier transform infrared(FTIR), mechanical testing and differential scaning calorimetry(DSC), respectively. It was found that with increasing the PTW content, the size of the dispersed PP particles decreased obviously, when the mass ratio of PA1010/PP/PTW is 70:30:7, the domain size showed a fine and uniform dispersion in the matrix, indicated PTW had an effective compatibilization effect on PA1010/PP blends. FTIR results show that the epoxy groups of PTW react with the end group of PA1010 in the blending process. DSC results show that the addition of PTW decreased the crystallization temperature of PA1010, indicate that PTW has an inhibition effect on the crystallization of PA1010. On the other hand, with increasing the mass fraction of PTW content, the crystallization temperature of PP became lower too, when the mass fraction of PTW was 5%, two crystalline peaks appeared, the crystallization of PP at the lower temperature should be assigned to homogeneous nucleation, the other one was heterogeneous nucleation. The appearance of howogennous nucleation demonstrated that the size of PP particles was very fine in the matrix from the other hand. When the mass fraction of PTW was 7%, the blend had the best comprehensive property and the izod impact strength of dried samples was 13.93 kJ/m2, which is 2 times that for the binary PA1010/PP blend. Meanwhile, the flexural strength, tensile strength and modulus can be maintained at a relative high level. The compatibilization mechanism of PTW lied in the chemical interactions occuring between the end group of PA1010 and epoxy groups of PTW during the blending process, and the compatibility between PP and ethylene groups of PTW. And hense the addition of PTW decreased the interfacial tension and the domain size dramatically, improved the mechanical properties greatly.",

        "abstract": "Maleic anhydride (MA) is incorporated into poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) blends to modify its properties through melt compounding. It is interesting to note that the toughness of PLA/PPC blends can be improved by 1355% while the strength is almost kept constant by adding very low content (as low as 0.9%) of MA into the blends. However, higher MA content in the blends leads to decrease in strength and further increase in toughness indicating an obvious plasticizing effect, while MA is shown to have no effect on the toughness of neat PLA. Rheological, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) studies have been carried out to understand the above results. It is believed that the improvement in mechanical performance originated from the largely retained molecular weight of PPC and improved interfacial interaction after processing. And relative large amount of MA in the blends is shown to mainly plasticize the PPC phase rather than the PLA phase. Such an effective method could provide PLA based biodegradable polymer blends with novel properties for industrial applications. \u00a9 BME-PT.",

In this article, according to the property that ultrasound travels in different velocities in anisotropic media, normal incident shear wave was utilized to explore the orientation structure of HDPE/ i PP blends obtained by dynamic packing injection molding. The ultrasonic technique is consistent with the 2D-WAXS in charactering the orientation degree of polymer chains, although ultrasonic technique focuses on the overall orientation of polymer blends while the 2D-WAXS reveals the crystalline orientation of each component. Our work demonstrates that ultrasonic technique might be a reliable, fast and easy way to characterize the orientation structure of crystalline polymer blends. The ultrasonic measurements were performed off-line, but the achievement provides the possibility for on-line detection of orientation structure in injection molding by using ultrasonic technique.",

        "abstract": "The brittle-ductile transition is a very important phenomenon for polymer toughening. Polypropylene (PP) is often toughened by using rubbers, e.g., ethylene-propylene diene monomer (EPDM) has often been used as a modifier. In this article, the toughening of PP by using a new kind of rubber, known as elastomeric nano-particle (ENP), and the brittleductile transition of PP/EPDM/ENP was studied. Compared to PP/EPDM binary blends, the brittle-ductile transition of PP/EPDM/ENP ternary blends occurred at lower EPDM contents. SEM experiment was carried out to investigate the etched and impact-fractured surfaces. ENP alone had no effect on the impact strength of PP, however, with the same EPDM content, PP/EPDM/ENP ternary blends had smaller particle size, better dispersion and smaller interparticle distance in contrary to PP/EPDM binary blends, which promoted the brittle-ductile transition to occur earlier. \u00a9 2006 World Scientific.",

The toughness of PPR is increased about twofold when the processing melt temperature increases from 180 to 250 \u00b0C. Systematic and detailed structural characterizations have been carried out to establish the structure-property relationships by using polarized light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, infrared microscopy and dynamic mechanical analysis. It is found that increasing the melt temperature is beneficial for the coalescence of rubbery domains and enhanced molecular mobility which are mainly responsible for the improvement in toughness. Other factors, such as molecular orientation, crystallinity and so on, seem to have little effect. The vital role of enhanced molecular mobility in improving toughness is further demonstrated by the annealing of injection molded samples at elevated temperature, i.e. 110 \u00b0C. \u00a9 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.",

        "abstract": "Polypropylene random copolymer (PPR) is one of important polypropylene types for the application fields needing for excellent toughness. Because of the random copolymer chain configuration, the polymorphic behavior of PPR is difficult to be altered even by adding \u03b2-nucleating agent (\u03b2-NA). In this study, a promising method was developed by adding isotactic polypropylene (iPP) into PPR/\u03b2-NA blend, which has leaded to a surprising enhancement in the \u03b2-crystallization capability of PPR. At the optimal component condition, the \u03b2-crystal content of PPR can reach the highest level of 92 % and the \u03b2-crystallization capability is improved by 56%. As a result of high \u03b2-crystal contents, a superior mechanical toughness has been attained. On the other hand, the fractional crystallization experiment suggests that the stereoregular chains of iPP could assist the formation of primary \u03b2-nuclei at the very early stage of crystallization. This special crystallization event dominates the final polymorphic composition in PPR. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that impact polypropylene copolymer (IPC) can be used to substitute iPP for the improvement of \u03b2-crystal content of PPR. This provides a huge possibility to improve the low temperature properties of PPR to enlarge its applications. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Their structures and properties were characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis and tensile testing. XRD, TEM and SEM results indicated that the MMT layers could be easily intercalated by the SPI matrix even by simple melt processing. The exfoliated MMT layers were randomly dispersed in the protein matrix as MMT content was low (less than 5 wt%), an incomplete exfoliation was evident from SEM results, and some primary particles were observed as the MMT content was high (from 5 wt% to 9 wt%). A significant improvement of the mechanical strength and thermal stability of SPI/MMT nanocomposites has been achieved.

        "abstract": "In this work, dopamine was introduced as a modifier for the surface treatment of ramie fiber. The interfacial crystallization of Poly (butylene succinate) (PBS) on the surface of treated fiber was investigated using polarized light microscope (PLM). It was found that raw ramie fiber has almost no nucleation ability on the crystallization of PBS. However, a beautiful transcrystalline (TC) structure could be successfully induced at the surface of treated fiber, which indicates a significantly improved nucleation ability of dopamine on PBS crystallization. Even more importantly, it was found that the interfacial shear strength between PBS and the treated fiber was very much improved due to the formation of transcrystalline structure. In order to further investigate the role of dopamine on interfacial enhancement, PBS/treated ramie fiber (10. wt%) composites were prepared by compression molding under the same condition with PLM. The tensile test showed that the tensile strength of composites with TC structure was increased by 30% when crystallized for 4. min than that of composites with an amorphous layer when crystallized for 0. min. This result suggested again that the interfacial enhancement was indeed due to the interfacial crystallization. Our work demonstrates that dopamine could be a green and novel surface modifier for natural fiber, and control of interfacial crystallization could be an efficient way for the interfacial enhancement between matrix and fillers. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

For achieving excellent tensile properties, the as-prepared PP/MWNTs composites were subjected to a unique injection molding, as so-called dynamic packing injection molding, to induce a highly oriented structure with both PP chains and MWNTs aligned along the shear flow direction. Not only Young's modulus and tensile strength were enhanced, as expected for oriented materials, but also more importantly composites containing only 0.1\u20130.3 wt% MWNTs were much ductile compared with the polymer matrix. The addition of PP- g -MMA made a drop in the elongation at break to only 15%; however, it could be improved to 80\u2013100% after incorporation of small amount of MWNTs. This improvement in ductility could be ascribed to: (1) the increased mobility of both the PP chains and MWNTs, as they are oriented along tensile deformation direction and (2) the bridging effect of the oriented MWNTs on the crack development during tensile failure.",

To further investigate the effect of surface groove structure of CNT bundles on the formation of NHSK structure in helical polymer systems, in the work reported here double-walled carbon nanotube (DWNT) fibers with bundle structure were used as nucleating agents and orientation templates for poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) crystallization. A fine NHSK structure with controlled lateral size and period of kebabs was successfully obtained under various experimental conditions by using DWNT bundles. This could be due to the geometric confinement effect of the surface groove structure of the DWNT bundles, which could facilitate the orientation of PLLA chains along the DWNT axis and the lateral formation of a stable nucleus. Our work suggests an efficient method for the functionalization of CNTs with biocompatible PLLA, which may have some potential applications in biomedical areas. In addition, it is demonstrated that the formation of NHSK structure can effectively improve the physical bonding between PLLA and nanotubes, thus significantly improving the mechanical properties of PLLA/CNT nanocomposite fibers. \u00a9 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.",

        "abstract": "Polyamide/polypropylene (PA1010/PP) blends were prepared by melt mixing using maleic anhydride-grafted ethylene-octene copolymer (POE-g-PMAH) as a reactive compatibilizer. The compatibilizing effects of POE-g-PMAH on PA1010/PP blends were investigated by means of scaning electron microscopy (SEM), mechanical testing, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scaning calorimetry (DSC), respectively. It was found that the addition of POE-g-PMAH could decrease the size of the dispersed PP particles, when the mass ratio of PA1010/PP/P0E-g-PMAH = 70/30/15, the domains showed a fine and uniform dispersion in the matrix. FTIR results showed that the anhydride carbonyl groups of POE-g-PMAH reacted with the end groups of PA1010 in the blending process. DSC results showed that addition of POE-g-PMAH decreased the crystallization temperature and crystallinity of PA1010 and PP in the blends, indicating that POE-g-PMAH had an inhibition effect on the crystallization of PA1010 and PP. Mechanical testing indicated that with increasing the POE-g-PMAH content, the Izod impact strength of dried samples increased gradually, when the content of POE-g-PMAH was 15%, the Izod impact strength of dried samples was 21. 13 kJ/m2, which is 3. 1 times that for the binary PA1010/PP blend. Meanwhile, the flexural strength, tensile strength and modulus can be maintained at a relatively high level. The compatibilization mechanism of POE-g-PMAH lied in the chemical interactions occuring between the terminal amino groups of PA1010 and anhydride of MAH in POE-g-PMAH during the melt mixing, and the compatibility between PP and ethylene-octene of POE in POE-g-PMAH. Hense the addition of POE-g-PMAH decreased the interfacial tension and the domain size dramatically, improved the mechanical properties greatly.",

        "abstract": "Polyoxymethylene (POM)/elastomer/filler ternary composites were prepared, in which thermoplastic polyurethane(TPU) and an inorganic filler, CaCO 3, were used to achieve balanced mechanical properties of POM. A two-step processing method, in which the elastomer and the filler were mixed to a masterbatch first and then the masterbatch was melt-blended with pure POM, was used to obtain a core-shell microstructure with CaCO3 covered by TPU. A brittle-ductile transition phenomenon was observed with increasing TPU content for this ternary system. To better understand the toughening mechanism, we investigated the fractured surface, interparticle distance, and the spherulite size of POM as function of the TPU and CaCO3 content. The critical TPU content depended on not only the content of CaCO3, but also the size of CaCO3 particles. The observed brittle-ductile transition was discussed based on the crystallinity and spherulite size of POM as well as Wu's critical interparticle distance theory. The results showed that the impact strength of POM/TPU/CaCO3 ternary system depends on a critical, interparticle distance, which varies from one system to another. The dependence of the impact strength on the spherulite size was considered for the first time, and a single curve was constructed. A critical spherulite size of 40 micron was found, at which brittle-ductile transition occurs, regardless of the TPU and CaCO33 content or the size of CaCO3 particles. Our results indicate that the spherulite size of POM indeed plays a role in determining the toughness, and must be considered when discussing the toughening mechanism.",

The physical meanings of such rheological evolution upon oscillatory shearing, which related closely to the dispersion and intercalation of organoclay in polymer, were discussed deeply. Especially, a structural recovery test was adopted to assess microstructure development induced by large-amplitude oscillatory shear and to better understand the intercalation mechanism. Based on the experimental results, a novel intercalation mechanism that was taken to account for the disentanglement of polymer chains was suggested to describe shear-induced dispersion behaviors of organoclay in polymer matrix.",

        "abstract": "Thin films of an amorphous polymer, polystyrene (PS), and a crystalline polymer, poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL), blend were prepared by spin coating a toluene solution. Surface chemical compositions of the blend films were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the surface and interface topographical changes were followed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). By changing the PS concentration and keeping the PCL concentration of the solution at 1 wt %, a great variety of morphologies were constructed. The results show that the morphology of the blend films can be divided into three regions with increasing PS concentration. In region I, PS island domains are embedded in PCL crystals when the PS concentration is lower than 0.3 wt % and the size of the PS island increases with increasing PS concentration. In region II, holes with different sizes surrounded by a low rim are obtained when the concentration of PS is between 0.35 and 0.5 wt %. After selectively washing the PS domains, we studied the interface morphology of PS/PCL and found that the upper PS-rich layer extended into the bottom PCL layer, forming a trench surrounding the holes. In region III, an enriched two-layer structure with the PS-rich layer on top of the blend films and the PCL-rich crystal layer underneath is obtained when the concentration of PS is higher than 0.5 wt %. Last, the formation mechanism of the different surface and interface morphologies is further discussed in terms of the vertical phase separation to a layered structure, followed by liquid-liquid dewetting and crystallization processes during spin coating.",

        "abstract": "Using polarized optical microscopy (POM) equipped with a hot stage, morphological investigations of an isotactic polypropylene (iPP) matrix, induced by a homogeneous iPP fibre and heterogeneous pure/modified nylon 6 fibres, were carried out. With respect to transcrystallization related to heterogeneous nucleation on the surface of the fibre, the nucleation mode was found to be different for iPP fibres and nylon 6 fibres. An iPP fibre can serve as a macroscopic linear nucleus, similarly to the shish-type structure formed in stress-induced crystallization, to induce kebab-like growth of lamellae, whereas numerous closely packed spherulites along nylon 6 fibres resulted in macroscopic transverse growth to form a transcrystallite owing to the limitation along the fibre axis. The difference in nature between these two transcrystallites can be further demonstrated by their optical characters related to the lamellar arrangement inside the transcrystallite. As for homogeneous iPP composites, the formation of transcrystallites results from lattice matching, in consideration of the same chemical structure and lattice parameters between fibre and matrix. The incorporation of calcium chloride into a nylon 6 fibre - to destroy its crystal structure - confirmed the role of lattice matching between nylon 6 fibre and iPP matrix. The addition of atactic polypropylene (aPP) in order to enhance the nucleation ability of the iPP matrix. also greatly weakened transcrystallization. Our work demonstrates that transcrystallization is just a matter of competition between interface nucleation and bulk nucleation, namely, if interface nucleation is faster than bulk nucleation, transcrystallization will develop. If not, it will be suppressed. \u00a9 2006 Society of Chemical Industry.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we first prepared isotactic Polypropylene (iPP)/organoclay nanocomposite specimens via twin-screw extruder and by adding compatibilizer (maleic anhybride grafted PP). Then PP and the composites were subjected to dynamic packing injection molding, in which the melt was firstly injected into the mold then forced to move repeatedly in a chamber by two pistons that moved reversibly with the same frequency as the solidification progressively occurred from the mold wall to the molding core part. The dispersion and orientation of layered organoclay in the nanocomposite were estimated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and 2d-wide angle X-ray scattering (2d-WAXS). A much higher degree of orientation of PP was found in the composites compared with the pure PP. This was explained by so called shear amplification in that a great enhancement of local stress occurred in the small interparticles region of two adjacent layered tactoids with different velocities. Furthermore, re-crystallization of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) by melting the dynamic packing injection molded samples has been investigated by polarizing light microscopy (PLM). A highly oriented threadlike crystallites was observed for the first time when crystallization occurs by melting the dynamic packing injection molded samples at 180 \u00b0C. However, spherulitic morphology is always obtained once PP crystallizes from an isotropic melt by melting the samples at 200 \u00b0C. The shear amplification mechanism and the formation mechanism of oriented threadlike crystallites have been discussed in detail.

After the melt is injected into the cold mold, its temperature and compatibility decrease simultaneously,phase separation takes place and becomes frozen in the specimen. High mechanical properties will be got when the phase separation develope to some extent, but it is difficult to control the phase compatibility and separation. The special method of oscillating packing injection molding under low pressure provides a condition to control the phase separation degree. Because the phase morphology and crystal morphology of HDPE/PP blends compete with each other, it is difficult to control the micro-phase separation. In this paper, the fine struture combined with the micro-phase separation and orientation were controlled by using that special injection method and high strength and high toughness blends were obtained. DSC and WAXD results indicate that the improvement of tensile strength is dependent on the number of shish-kebab crystals and the degree of macromolecule orientation caused by the oscillating packing injection molding. SEM results indicate that the impact strength is dependent on the degree of macro- and micro-phase separation. The high tensile strength 97.1MPa and high toughness 45.5kJ/m 2 of HDPE/PP blends were achieved when the PP content in the blends was 8% and 20% .respectively. Which are 4.3 times and 9.5 times as high as the corresponding values of their static specimens respectively. The future work will be carried out to investigate the phase morphology and crystal morphology as well as the possibility of cocrystallization of PP and HOPE under oscillating packing injection conditions.",

        "abstract": "Self assembly of poly(styrene-b-dimethylsiloxane) (PS-b-PDMS) followed by reactive ion etching technique is a promising method for fabricating periodical silica nanopatterns and can be applicable for device fabrication on nanoscale. We demonstrated a technologically useful way to control the inorganic silica nanostructures in thin films by directly mixing asymmetric (PS-b-PDMS) diblock copolymer with homopolymers of majority component, polystyrene (PS) under solvent vapor annealing followed by UV/O3 treatment. The effects of molecular weight and volume fraction of added homopolymer (PS) on morphology and size of the nanostructure of blends have been carefully investigated by atomic force microscopy. Different morphology transitions observed on the ordering film surface by atomic force microscopy (AFM) are associated with kinetics of phase evolution with respect to homo-PS with different molecular weight. The periodic spacings and dimensions of the microdomains were readily tuned at the same time, just by adjusting the molecular weight and volume fraction of the blended homopolymer. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "Poly(L-lactic acid) (PLA) samples prepared by hot pressing were treated by two different processes: process a-quenching of the molten specimens in water, then annealing at high temperatures; process b-direct crystallization at high temperatures from the molten specimens. The crystal modification and morphology of PLA were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis, polarized light microscopy, and wide-angle X-ray diffraction. In the case of process a, the (disordered \u03b1) crystal modification was formed at relatively low annealing temperature (T a < 100\u00b0C), while the ordered phase was formed in the case of process a at high T a (> 100\u00b0C) and process b. Furthermore, in process a, the nucleation density of spherulites was higher and the radius of the spherulites was much smaller compared with that of the spherulites formed by process b. The effects of crystal modification and morphology on the impact behaviors of PLA were investigated by notched Izod impact testing. The macroscopic fracture toughness was discussed in terms of the microscopic structures. Finally, we suggest an alternative approach for the preparation of high-performance PLA.

For miscible polymer blends of PVC/NBR, because there is no phase inversion but a homogeneous system a linear change (without discontinuity) of ultrasonic velocity and attenuation was observed in a whole composition ranges. For immiscible polymer blends, namely, PP/PS, PS/EPDM and PS/SBS system, the non-linear variation of ultrasonic velocity with composition indicates the immiscibility. On the other hand, the intensity of scattering attenuation changed from system to system depending on the size of dispersed phase, but a discontinuity of scattering attenuation was always observed as the phase inversion occurred. Our result suggests the sensitivity of ultrasonic attention vs phase inversion and may be served as a useful method to fast determine the phase inversion for immiscible polymer blends.",

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results show that PVAc is selectively localized in the PLA phase and at the interface between PPC and PLA phases. As a result, these interface-localized PVAc layers act as not only a compatibilizer to improve the phase dispersion significantly but also a bridge to increase the interfacial adhesion between PPC and PLA phases dramatically. Both of them are believed to be responsible for the enhancement in mechanical properties.

        "abstract": "Expanded graphite (EG) films exhibit potential use in a wide field including thermal management, conductive applications, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding. However, their poor tensile strength and brittleness are crucial deficiencies for commercial applications. To address these defects, in our work, natural rubber (NR) is employed to improve EG films for better mechanical strength and flexibility. The origin of the strengthening effect of EG films by the addition of natural rubber mainly arises from the formation of a simulate shell structure. Compared to the neat EG films, the addition of merely 2 wt% NR can give rise to superior ductility. Further, the loading of 10 wt% NR realizes a significant mechanical enhancement of the EG/NR films, i.e., 2.4 and 11.4 times increase in tensile strength and elongation at break, respectively. Besides, EG/NR films containing 10 wt% NR can still sustain excellent thermal and electric conductivities of 173 W\u00b7n\u22121\u00b7K\u22121 and 75 S\u00b7cm\u22121, respectively. Furthermore, a very high EMI of 41.4 dB is achieved as the film thickness reaches 50 \u03bcm. Thus, the lightweight EG/NR films with comprehensive performance as well as their virtue of green and simple large-scale preparation endow them with the possibility of designing next-generation flexible electronics.",

        "abstract": "Herein, we report a facile and low cost method for the fabrication of superhydrophobic surface via spin coating the mixture of polydimethylsiloxane precursor (PDMS) and silicon dioxide (SiO 2) nanoparticles. The surface hydrophobicity can be well tuned by adjusting the weight percent of PDMS and SiO 2. The water contact angle (WCA) can increase from 106.8 \u00b1 1.2\u00b0 on PDMS film to 165.2 \u00b1 2.3\u00b0 on PDMS/SiO 2 coating, companying with a change from adhering to rolling which was observed from tilting angle (TA) characterization. Multi-scale physical structures with SiO 2 nanoparticle aggregates and networks of SiO 2 nanoparticle aggregates are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM), and they can be observed more clearly from the AFM images treated with software (WSxM). Then the relationship between surface hydrophobicity and structures is further discussed based on Wenzel and Cassie models, indicating that the appearance of networks of nanoparticle aggregates is important in the Cassie state. The superhydrophobic coating can keep the superhydrophobicity at least for one month under environment conditions and readily regenerate after mechanical damage. Additionally, the superhydrophobic coating can be fabricated using other methods including dip coating, spray coating and casting. Thus, a large area of superhydrophobic coatings can be easily fabricated. Therefore the range of possible applications for these facile and versatile methods can be expanded to various actual conditions. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "The phase behavior of polymer blends under the effect of shear has been a subject of considerable interest from the viewpoint of both theoretical research and industrial application, because the shear stress is unavoidable during processing. In this work, we reported the change of phase behavior and mechanical properties of Polystyrene (PS)/Styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS) blends achieved via a shear-assistant injection molding, which was called dynamic packing injection molding (DPIM). The size of dispersed SEBS particles in PS matrix was found to be increased for the samples obtained by dynamic packing injection molding (DPIM), compared with those obtained by conventional molding, indicating a shear induced phase coarsening. The shear induced phase coarsening can be further demonstrated by the decrease of impact strength of dynamic packing injection molded samples. However, the shear-induced phase coarsening will be eliminated after annealing the samples at high temperature for certain time. The particle size, which related to the capability to deform under the effect of shear, was found to play an important role to determine the phase morphology. Our result suggested that shear stress induced phase coarsening was a process of not only molecular configuration change but also deformation change under shear.",

        "title": "The role of clay network on macromolecular chain mobility and relaxation in isotactic polypropylene/organoclay nanocomposites",
        "abstract": "It is well known that a so-called \u201cthree-dimensional filler network structure\u201d will be constructed in the polymer/layered silicate nanocomposites when the content of layered clay reaches a threshold value, at which the silicate sheets are incapable of freely rotating, due to physical jamming and connecting of the nanodispersed layered silicate. In this article, the effect of such clay network on the mobility and relaxation of macromolecular chains in isotactic polypropylene(iPP)/organoclay nanocomposites was investigated in detail with a combination of DMTA, DSC, TGA, TEM, rheometry and melt flow index measurements. The main aim is to establish a relationship between the mesoscopic filler network structure and the macroscopic properties of the polymer nanocomposites, particularly to explore the role of the clay network on the mobility and relaxation of macromolecular chains. It was found that the nanodispersed clay tactoids and layers play less important or dominant roles on the mobility of iPP chains depending on the formation of percolating filler network. The turning point of macroscopic properties appeared at 1 wt% organoclay content. Before this point, the effect of organoclay can be negligible, and the increase of chain mobility was ascribed to the decrease of molecular weight of polymer chains, as commonly occurs during dynamic melt processing; after this point, however, a reduced mobility of chains and a retarded chain relaxation were observed and attributed to the formation of a mesoscopic filler network. The essential features of such a mesoscopic organoclay network were estimated and discussed on the basis of stress relaxation and structural reversion measurements. A schematic model was proposed to describe the different relaxation and motion behaviors of macromolecular chains in the unfilled polymer and the filled hybrids with partial and percolated organoclay networks, respectively.",

The storage modulus is also remarkably increased with the increasing of CaCO3 loading and decreasing of CaCO3 particle sizes, as revealed by DAM. Two relaxation peaks are seen for silicon sealant. One is around 153 K, corresponding to the glass transition temperature (Tg), and the other is around 233 K, corresponding to the melting temperature(Tm). Both Tg and Tm increase with the increasing of CaCO3 loading and decreasing of CaCO3 particle sizes. DMA results suggest that the interaction between nano CaCO3 particles and silicon sealant is quite strong.

The melting behavior and crystallinity were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The dispersion of whiskers and interfacial adhesion in the prepared HDPE/SMC whisker composites were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The mechanical properties were evaluated by mechanical tests and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). DSC data indicated that the melting temperature and the crystallinity of HDPE/SMC whisker composites kept almost constant with the addition of SMC whisker. SEM results revealed that SMC whisker could be well-dispersed in HDPE matrix and had a good interfacial interaction with HDPE, even up to a high content of 30 wt%. Mechanical tests showed that the tensile strength, tensile modulus and flexural strength of HDPE were significantly improved by the addition of SMC whisker. DMA results indicated a much enhanced storage modulus, loss modulus and loss factor. By comparing the literature data from other filler-reinforced HDPE, our work suggested that SMC whisker could be one of the best reinforcing agents for the modification of HDPE. \u00a9 2009 World Scientific Publishing Company.",

        "abstract": "The effect of compatibility on phase morphology and orientation of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) blends under shear stress was investigated via dynamic packing injection molding (DPIM). The compatibility of iPP blended with other polymers, namely, atactic polypropylene (aPP), octane-ethylene copolymer (POE), ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (EPDM) and poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA), have first been studied using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). These blends were subjected to DPIM, which relies on the application of shear stress fields to the melt/solid interfaces during the packing stage by means of hydraulically actuated pistons. The phase morphology, orientation and mechanical properties of the injection-molded samples were characterized by SEM, 2D WAXS and Instron. For incompatible iPP/EVA blends, a much elongated and deformed EVA particles and a higher degree of iPP chain orientation were observed under the effect of shear. However, for compatible iPP/aPP blends, a less deformed and elongated aPP particles and less oriented aPP chains were deduced. It can be concluded that the compatibility between the components decreases the deformation and orientation in the polymer blends. This is most likely due to the hindering effect, resulting from the molecular entanglement and interaction in the compatible system. \u00a9 2006 World Scientific.",

        "abstract": "In this article, molecular orientation of crystalline and amorphous phases of both linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) and isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and epitaxy in the LLDPE/iPP blends prepared via dynamic packing injection molding have been investigated with the aid of polarized Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and two-dimensional X-ray scattering (2D-WAXS). In LLDPE-rich blends, LLDPE was oriented along the shear flow direction, and iPP kept very low orientation. No epitaxial growth between LLDPE and iPP was observed. However, for the blends with LLDPE content less than 50 wt %, where iPP was the matrix and LLDPE formed the droplets, iPP was highly oriented along shear flow direction and LLDPE epitaxially grew onto iPP. The contact planes were (100)LLDPE and (010)iPP, and LLDPE molecules were about 50 degrees apart from the shear direction. The epitaxy fraction in LLDPE/iPP blends could be tentatively calculated from the values of orientation function of the LLDPE crystalline a-axis (fa) and that of crystalline b-axis (fb). Both tensile strength and tensile modulus decreased with the increase of LLDPE composition, indicating they were composition dependent, though shear-induced orientation and epitaxial crystallization might play some role. The impact strength of the blend samples reached a plateau in the LLDPE composition range of 20-50%, due to the contribution of orientation and epitaxy.",

        "abstract": "Dibenzylidene sorbitol (DBS) exists in the form of fibril and usually acts as an effective nucleating agent to facilitate crystallization of polyolefin during manufacturing. In this research, the isothermal crystallization of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) containing different amounts of DBS was followed by dynamic rheometry, and described upon a viewpoint of viscoelastic property evolution. Since the adopted temperatures within the entire sample preparation and characterization process were below the melting point of DBS, the DBS additives played a role of only solid nucleating agent, thus the possible effect of a changed miscibility between iPP and DBS on the viscoelastic properties as change of temperature could be ignored. Although saturation of nucleating iPP was observed at 0.1% DBS concentration, a negative influence with further increasing DBS content on the crystallization of iPP was determined for the first time via time sweep of G\u2032 upon a single angular frequency and application of \"inverse quenching\" protocol within a wide range of angular frequency. Even more, a largely increased G\u2032 and viscosity were observed in the melt as decreasing the temperature of iPP containing 0.1% DBS, suggesting a strong quasi-solid like behavior before iPP crystallization. A complement for well understanding the crystallization of iPP containing nucleating agent was discussed based on the formation of the DBS fibrils' network, the interfacial tension between crystalline/amorphous phase, and the consistency of crystallizing lamellae. Our study demonstrates clearly that the crystalline characteristic upon saturation of heterogeneous nucleating is difficult to be detected by traditional means, but could be followed reasonably by rheological measurements which is much sensitive to the microstructural changes. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Strong interfacial interaction is extremely important for achieving efficient mechanical reinforcement in polymer/inorganic nanoparticle composites. In this study, it was demonstrated for the first time that largely improved interfacial interaction could be obtained in continuously melt-spun fibers of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNTs) composites, just by an increasing of the deformation extent (draw ratio). The superior interaction is attributed to high deformation inducing a formation of charge-transfer-type F-C bonding between all-trans conformation PVDF chains and extended MWCNTs. As a result, a large mechanical enhancement has been achieved. For the fibers prepared at the highest draw ratio of 200, the tensile strength and modulus are improved for 235% and 109%, respectively, after adding only 0.5 wt% MWCNTs to PVDF. More importantly, a mechanical model fitting, based on the rule of mixtures, indicates that in the case of the highest draw ratio the theoretical strength of MWCNTs is comparable to its real failure strength measured directly between two opposing AFM cantilever tips (Yu et al 2000 Science 287 637). Our present study suggests a great deal of promise for achieving highly efficient CNT enhancement via the non-covalent interaction arising from simple physical fabrication like melt-spinning.",

        "abstract": "In this article, a quantitative measurement of orientation functions for both the polymer matrix and the filler has been carried out, for the first time, in high-density polyethylene (HDPE)/inorganic whisker (SMCW) composite fibers, with aid of polarized Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. A highly oriented structure was observed in the as-spun fibers, and the orientation functions of both polyethylene and the whisker decreased with the increase of whisker content. During tensile deformation of the fibers, the orientation functions were continuously enhanced as increasing of the strain for the matrix and the filler. However, a fast increase of orientation was found for pure polyethylene fiber and composite fibers with less whisker content, and a slow increase for composite fibers with higher whisker content. Very interestingly, a formation of hybrid shish-kebab structure with whisker acting as shish and polyethylene lamellae as kebab was observed in the as-spun fiber with low loading of whisker (less than 10 wt.%), resulting in a strong interfacial interaction between polyethylene and whisker. As a result, the highest tensile strength was observed in this sample even it had a lower orientation compared with that of pure HDPE. For the composite fiber with 10 and 20 wt.% whisker, no obvious formation of hybrid shish-kebab was observed, resulting in a poor interfacial interaction and subsequently, lower tensile strength. That result indicates that the tensile strength of the fibers depends not only on the orientations of the polyethylene and the whisker, more importantly, on the interfacial interaction between matrix and the filler. The change of orientations of the composite fibers by adding whisker and the formation of hybrid shish-kebab structure were discussed based on rheological measurement. Keywords A.

        "abstract": "Most of the articles on polymer nanocomposites focus on the importance of chemistry used to modify the surface of the clay, usually montmorillonite (MMT), and characterization of the nano-scale structure obtained. The role and importance of processing were also discussed recently. However, few papers concerning the correlation between morphology of MMT and mechanical properties were published. In order to understand the tensile behavior of PP/Montmorillonite (MMT) nanocomposites better, and to further improve the reinforcement efficiency, we first prepared the PP nanocomposites via direct melt intercalation using conventional twin-screw extrusion. The dispersion and tensile property of the composites were then investigated by SEM, XRD, TEM and a video-controlled tensile set-up. The macroscopic and microscopic dispersion of MMT in PP matrix was verified by XRD and TEM, combined with SEM. The tensile properties were obtained by video-controlled tensile set-up, which gives true stress-strain curve. It was found that a partly intercalated and partly exfoliated structure (also called incomplete exfoliation) existed in the system, Though the tensile strength of PP nanocomposites is not much improved in engineering stress-strain curves, more than 20% increase of true stress was found in a true stress-strain experiment at high true strain, which indicates that only oriented silicate layers can have a big effect on tensile properties. Not only orientation of silicate platelets but also the degree of exfoliation is a key factor to determine the reinforcement efficiency. The reinforcement efficiency of MMT has been discussed based on the \"continuum\" Halpin-Tsai equations. A good agreement was found between experimental data and theoretical prediction by changing N value (number of platelets per stack) which corresponding to different state of the dispersion of MMT in PP matrix.",

Dendritic crystal analogue of the diffusion-controlled finger-like crystal of the pure PCL film with a flat-on lamellae thickness about 11 nm is obtained, and it shows that most parts of that film is occupied with dendritic crystals. While PCL has polar interaction with the mica substrate, it is stable for molten PCL layer on the mica. The anisotropic dewetting process indicates the wetting ability and stability of the blend films on the substrate are anisotropic. The changes of the PS molecular weight causes the different distribution of PS within the blend films, which combines with the different stability of liquid PS on liquid PCL leading to the different dewetting process for the blend films.",

        "abstract": "In this study, isotactic polypropylene (iPP) samples were prepared by conventional injection molding (CIM) and pressure vibration injection molding (PVIM), in which a periodical shear field was imposed on the iPP melt during the cooling solidification. The distribution of supermolecular structures of samples was investigated by Polarized Light Microscopy (PLM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Results show that the through-the thickness-morphology of sample prepared by CIM features a typical skin-core structure, as a result of general shear-induced crystallization. This structure can be divided into three layers, including a skin layer in which the shish-kebab structure was found, a transition region with deformed spherulite structure and a core layer with spherulitic structure. However, the morphology of the sample prepared by PVIM, as a result of periodical shear-induced crystallization, features a richer and fascinating supermolecular structure and can not be roughly divided into three layers. A region full of shish-kebab-like cylindrulite structures was found between the transition region and the core layer, which is rare to be seen in conventional injection molding. Based on their various core structures, two kinds of shish-kebab-like cylindrulites were defined: one is multi-fibril-core cylindrulite of which core is an assembly of multiple fibrils, and the other is single-fibril-core cylindrulite of which the core just contains a single fibril. Based on the investigated results, a schematic illustration is proposed to depict the through-the thickness-distribution of supermolecular structure of iPP sample prepared by PVIM. The mechanism of the formation of the two kinds of shish-kebab-like cylindrulite structures is also depicted by a schematic illustration, and it was discussed in terms of periodical shear-induced crystallization. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

PA66 fibers at high draw ratio demonstrate a 40% increase in tensile strength, 66% increase in modulus and a considerable increase in toughness. It is demonstrated that this reinforcement can be mainly attributed to high-draw-ratio-induced good dispersion and orientation of MWNTs, particularly the enhanced interfacial adhesion between MWNT and matrix thanks to interfacial crystallization. Our work provides a simple but efficient method to achieve good dispersion and strong interfacial interaction through melt spinning.

        "abstract": "Controlling the hierarchical structure of melt-processed polymers is vital to \"structuring\" processing and tailoring properties of the product. In this work, polypropylene (PP)/octene-ethylene copolymer (POE) blends were injection-molded using so-called dynamic packing injection technique, which imposed oscillatory shear on the gradually cooled melt during the packing solidification stage. In this way, samples with highly oriented PP matrix and elongated POE particles were obtained. Most interestingly, it was found for the first time that the elongated POE particles could not improve any impact toughness of oriented PP, which is completely different from that for the isotropic ones. Polarized optical microscope, scanning electron microscope, micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry were used to characterize the microstructures along sample thickness. The crack-initiation term, impact fractured surface and cross-section of the impact surface were inspected to understand the difference in impact behavior between the oriented PP/POE blends and their isotropic counterparts. The results show that massive crazing or plastic flow of the matrix could not be effectively initiated in the oriented blends. Our work provides a good example for better understanding structure-property relationship of polymers via well controlling their internal hierarchical structure. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this additive system, EG acted as a heterogeneous nucleating agent to reduce energy barrier for nucleation, while PEG played as plasticizer to improve mobility of PET chains. Simultaneously adding EG and PEG resulted in faster crystallization kinetics than the cases of solely adding EG or PEG in both of non-isothermal and isothermal crystallization processes, indicating a synergistic effect of EG and PEG on enhancing PET crystallization. However, for non-isothermal crystallization process, in which crystallization occurred from a cooling melt, EG played a dominant role. As to isothermal crystallization process where crystallization took place in a super-cooling state, PEG seemed to be more important. Moreover, the chain conformation change among the semi-crystalline PET specimens was ascertained by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. \u00a9 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

        "abstract": "In order to better understand the effect of shear stress on the crystal morphology and orientation of polyolefins, dynamic packing injection molding was used to prepare oriented pure polypropylene (PP) and its blends with linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE). The obtained samples were characterized via 2d-SAXS, 2d-WAXD and AFM. Macroscopically, shear induced morphology with surface skin, central core and oriented layer between the skin and the core was observed in the cross-section areas of the samples. For pure PP, a highly oriented structure was seen in the sheared layer but much less oriented structure exists in the core. The orientation in the skin lies in between. The shish\u2013kebab structure, composed of stretched chains (shish) and layered crystalline lamellae (kebabs), was found in the sheared layer. Shish structure exists mainly in the skin layer and oriented spherulits dominates in the core. For PP/LLDPE (50/50) blends, a change of phase morphology from less-phase-separated structure (homogeneous) in the skin, to co-continuous structure in the sheared layer and sea-island structure in the core was observed. PP formed a shish\u2013kebab structure in all the three layers. And on the other hand, a very unique crystal morphology and lamellar orientation of LLDPE were obtained, with the lamellar stack oriented either perpendicularly or 45\u201350\u00b0 away from the shear flow direction.",

In this study, a potential piezoelectric damping composite was developed by simply melt mixing poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) with small amounts of organic modified montmorillonite (OMMT) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The piezoelectric, mechanical and electrical properties were investigated using a dynamic mechanical analyser, direct current electrical resistivity measurements, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and the direct quasi-static d 33 piezoelectric coefficient method. It was found that the damping property of PVDF can be greatly improved by adding both MWCNTs and OMMT, and the composite containing 1.9 wt% of MWCNTs and 3 wt% of OMMT showed the best damping property. A model and an approximate calculation were applied to explain the improved damping property.

        "title": "Crystal morphology and tensile properties of LLDPE containing PP fibers as obtained via dynamic packing injection molding",
        "abstract": "The fibrillated linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE)/isotactic polypropylene (iPP) fiber blends were subjected to dynamic packing injection molding (DPIM), in which the prolonged shear was exerted on the melt during solidification stage. Transcrystallization of LLDPE on PP fibers, with stacked lamellae parallel to each other and aligned approximately perpendicular to the long axial of the fibers, has been achieved for the first time in DPIM due to the prolonged shear. PP fibers were found to align parallel to the flow direction along thickness up to the oriented zone of sample prepared by DPIM. The presence of oriented PP fibers enhanced the orientation of LLDPE that developed row-nucleated type morphology. The molding temperatures were changed between 160 \u00b0C and 200 \u00b0C to investigate the effect of molding temperature on the crystalline microstructure of the blends. As increasing the molding temperature from 160 \u00b0C to 200 \u00b0C, the partial melting of PP fiber was changed to complete melting, resulting in a dramatic change of the crystal morphology and the mechanical properties as well. Keywords LLDPE/PP fiber blend Shear-induced orientation Transcrystallization 1 Introduction Studies on the property and morphology of polyolefin blends have always received great academic interests, not only because of their wide application in industry and ease of re-cycling, but more importantly because of their diversiform and fascinated morphology depending on molecular structure, thermal history and external stress field. In order to modulate the morphology of blends and improve the property as much as possible, the key issue is to establish the relationship between property and morphology. The crystalline and phase morphologies of PP/PE blends have been extensively investigated [1\u20134] . Usually, semicrystalline polyolefin blends have specific interaction resulting in particular crystallization morphologies at the interface. Transcrystallization at interfaces, as a surface-induced crystallization, is an effective and economical method to improve the interfacial adhesion, and thus is attractive for many researchers in the past [5\u20138] . Transcrystallization is induced by the preferential heterogeneous nucleation at the interface between different components. The prerequisite for transcrystallization is the\u00a0presence of a high density of active nuclei on the substrate/fiber surface.\u00a0The closely packed nuclei hinder the full extension of spherulites, which are then forced to grow in one direction, namely perpendicular to the substrate/fiber [9,10] . To control transcrystallization, the modification of substrate/fiber or polymer matrix is equivalent due to the competition between interface nucleation and bulk nucleation. It has been found that shear\u00a0plays an important role to induce the transcrystallization\u00a0by enhancing the interface nucleation. An enhanced orientation and crystallization of iPP by using ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) short fiber have been reported by\u00a0Hsiao et\u00a0al. [2,11] . A cylindritic morphology in the iPP matrix with UHMWPE in the center was observed. Li\u00a0and coworkers studied the formation of the shish-kebab morphologies together with transcrystallization of PP in\u00a0a microfibrillar PET/PP blend [12] . Even more, twisted lamellae were reported in an iPP transcrystallinity induced by aramid fibers in Ref.\u00a0 [13] . The presence of transcrystallinity is expected to have a positive effect on the longitudinal properties of the composite materials, as measured in nylon66 composites [14] and as predicted for PP composites under stress [15] . Great interest is focused on the relationship between structure and morphology. However, most of the researches are in theory [16\u201319] and only few works concern with the practical processing field. In fact, no well-defined transcrystallization has been encountered in polymer composites subjected to conventional processing methods (such as extrusion and injection molding), although there are some indications in literature [12] . Achieving transcrystallization in polymer composites processed by conventional methods has not only significant theoretical value but also important practical applications. As part of long-term project aimed at super polyolefin blends, we are seeking to establish a fundamental understanding of structure\u2013property\u2013processing relationships through the control of phase separation, molecular orientation and\u00a0crystal morphology of polyolefin blends. In our previous papers [20] , we reported the results of mechanical properties and structural studies of some polyolefin blends (such as HDPE/LDPE, HDPE/iPP, iPP/EPDM) obtained by dynamic packing\u00a0injection molding. We have found that the molecular architecture, composition, temperature and shear stress field play important roles to determine the final morphology and\u00a0mechanical properties. A well-defined epitaxial growth of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) on the lamellae of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) has been achieved for the first time in their blends via dynamic packing injection molding [21] . In this work, the melt blends of linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) and isotactic polypropylene (iPP) fiber were prepared by twin-screw extruder set at a barrel temperature of 130\u2013140 \u00b0C, which is well below the melting point of\u00a0PP fibers. Then the fibrillated blends were subjected to dynamic packing injection molding (DPIM), in which the melt is firstly injected into the mold and then forced to\u00a0move repeatedly in a chamber by two pistons that move reversibly with the same frequency as the solidification progressively occurs from the mold wall to the molding core part. In our work, melt was forced to shear, which would induce oriented crystallization and macromolecular chain aligned parallel to the shear direction. Moreover, the morphology of PP can be kept by controlling the temperature lower than T m of PP in cooling process. PP fiber is partially miscible with PE, which will avoid void and crack at the interface. All of this would be\u00a0in favor of the transcrystalline growth. We will focus on crystal morphology and tensile properties of obtained blends. Our proposes are twofolds: one is to explore the possibility of transcrystallization of LLDPE containing fibers via injection molding under the effect of shear, and the other is to achieve super polyolefin blends with both high tensile strength and modulus and by controlling orientation and interfacial microstructure. LLDPE was chosen, instead of HDPE or LDPE, as the matrix, based on the consideration that LLDPE has higher melting temperature difference with PP compared with HDPE, and has higher crystallization ability compared with LDPE. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials A linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) with a melt flow index of 2.6 g/10 min (190 \u00b0C, 2.16 kg) was supplied by Maoming Petrochemical Corp. (trade marked as 7042). It has a melting point of 123 \u00b0C and a density of 0.92 g cm \u22123 . A commercially available polypropylene fiber (PP fiber)\u00a0with a diameter of 20 \u03bcm was used in this study and has a melting point of 163 \u00b0C. According to the provider's data, the tensile strength and E -modulus of this PP fiber are approximated to 350 MPa and 3500 MPa, respectively. 2.2 Samples preparation Melt blending of LLDPE/PP fiber composites was conducted using a co-rotating twin-screw extruder (TSSJ-25) set at a barrel temperature of 130\u2013140 \u00b0C. After producing pellets, the composites were subjected to dynamic packing injection molding (DPIM) with molding temperature set at 160 \u00b0C, 170 \u00b0C, 180 \u00b0C and 200 \u00b0C. The shear rate is about 10 s \u22121 calculated from the geometry of mold. The schematic representation of this method and the processing parameters can be found somewhere [22] . The injection molding under static packing was also carried out by using the same processing parameters but without shearing for comparison purpose. The specimen obtained by dynamic packing injection molding is called dynamic sample, and the specimen obtained by static\u00a0packing injection molding is called static sample. The structure of dynamic samples is different from that of static ones, with the appearance of oriented zone between skin and core zones, the characteristic of dynamic samples, caused by the shear stress. The detailed description can be found elsewhere [23] . 2.3 Characterizations and measurements The two dimensional wide-angle X-ray scattering experiments (2D-WAXS) were conducted using a Rigaku Denki RAD-B diffractometer. The wavelength of the monochromated X-ray from Cu K\u03b1 radiation was 0.154 nm and reflection mode was used. The samples were placed with the\u00a0orientation (flow direction) perpendicular to the beams. The intensity was corrected by subtracting the background scattering. The morphologies of the blends were studied by preferential etching of the amorphous phase in mixed acid for 1 h at the temperature of 60 \u00b0C. The samples were fractured in liquid nitrogen prior to etching. Then the surface was coated with gold and subsequently examined by an X-650 Hitachi scanning electron microscope with accelerated voltage 20 kV. A Perkin\u2013Elmer diamond-II differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine the melting points of LLDPE and LLDPE/PP fiber blend. The test samples (about 5 mg) were heated from 40 \u00b0C to 200 \u00b0C at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min under a nitrogen atmosphere. Polarizing light observations were performed using a Leica DMIP polarizing light microscopy (PLM) equipped with a Linkam THMS 600 hot stage under crossed polarizer. Thin slice was cut from the injection-molded sample, inserted between two microscope cover glasses, melted at 150 \u00b0C, which was upper the melting point of LLDPE and lower than that of PP, and then squeezed to obtain thin films. An Instron Universal Testing Machine was used to get the tensile strength and modulus under a crosshead speed of 50 mm/min according to GB/T1040-92 standard, and the measured temperature was around 20 \u00b0C. In the mechanical testing, at least four samples have been measured and the average values were reported. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Mechanical properties Fig.\u00a01 (a) shows the trends of tensile strength vs. PP fiber content in LLDPE/PP fiber blends injection-molded at 160 \u00b0C. For static samples, one observes a very low tensile strength and almost unchanged value with increasing PP fiber content up to 20 wt% (the tensile strength is in-between 12 MPa and 14 MPa). This result indicates that PP fiber could not obviously improve the tensile strength via conventional injection molding in the investigated range of composition. In this case not much orientation is expected for both LLDPE matrix and PP fibers. For dynamic samples, however, an increase of tensile strength is seen even for pure LLDPE (from 12 MPa of static one to 19 MPa of dynamic one), as caused by molecular orientation under effect of shear. A further increase of tensile strength from 19 MPa to 29 MPa is achieved after the PP fiber content reaches to 10 wt%. This is certainly due to the reinforcement of PP fibers under the effect of shear. In this case much orientation is expected for both LLDPE and PP fibers as well, which has been confirmed by 2D-WAXS measurements. Tensile modulus presented in Fig.\u00a01 (b) shows a continuous increase with increasing PP fiber content for both static and dynamic samples. The tensile modulus of the dynamic ones is about 70\u201380 MPa higher than that for static ones, this is again due to the shear-induced orientation for both LLDPE and PP fibers. Through comparing the tensile properties between static samples and dynamic samples, it can be concluded that the dependence of tensile properties on the PP fiber content is weak in the former, whereas the PP fiber is efficient for the enhancement of mechanical properties in the latter. In the static samples, the polymer lamellae orient randomly, at the same time, the interconnection between PP fiber and PE matrix is very weak, resulting in the limited strengthening of properties by addition of PP fiber. As to the dynamic samples, the prolonged shear function causes the high level oriented structure and particularly promotes the interaction between PP phase and PE phase through tailoring the crystalline morphology at the interface, which will be experimentally proved in the following section. As mentioned above, for polymer/polymer fiber blends, the molding temperature may play an important role to determine the mechanical properties. From the DSC heating diagram presented in Fig.\u00a02 , the melting temperatures ( T m ) of LLDPE matrix and PP fiber are determined to be about 123 \u00b0C and 163 \u00b0C, respectively. Three processing temperatures, 160 \u00b0C, 180 \u00b0C and 200 \u00b0C, have been chosen to prepare injection-molding samples. The low temperature 160 \u00b0C is little lower than T m of PP fiber and PP fiber will remain unmolten or only occur partly molten at the surface, whereas, PP fiber will be totally molten at other temperatures 180 \u00b0C and 200 \u00b0C. It can be anticipated that the reinforcement efficiency will decrease as the molding temperature increases due to the melting of polymer fibers. For example, the tensile properties of LLDPE containing 10 wt% PP fiber injection-molded at different temperatures are shown in Fig.\u00a01 (c) and (d). For static samples, the effect of molding temperature on tensile strength can be ignored because no significant change is seen as the molding temperature increases. Whereas a sharp decrease of tensile strength from 29 MPa to 18 MPa is observed for dynamic samples as the molding temperature increases from 160 \u00b0C to 200 \u00b0C. This can be understood as due to the melting of PP fibers and relaxation of LLDPE molecules (thus result in a less orientation) as molded at higher temperature. A similar trend of tensile modulus is seen. One also observes an increase in tensile modulus of static samples, as the molding temperature increases. This may be due to a higher crystallinity and a bigger crystal size as molded at high temperature, which will be further identified by DSC heating test and SEM observation. 3.2 Morphology and interphase structure Macroscopically, contrasting to the static samples merely consisted of the skin and the core, the main feature of dynamic samples is the shear-induced morphologies with the core in the center, the oriented zone surrounding the core and the skin in the cross-section areas of the samples. The effect of prolonged shear on the orientation behavior of LLDPE/PP fiber blends has been illustrated through comparing 2D-WAXS patterns between static samples and dynamic samples, and only the core of static sample and the oriented zone of dynamic sample were investigated. For the static samples, as shown in Fig.\u00a03 (a) and (b), only isotropic circles of (110) plane (2 \u03b8 = 21.6\u00b0) and (200) plane (2 \u03b8 = 23.6\u00b0) of orthorhombic PE \u03b1-modification are observed even if the PP fiber has been incorporated, implying that there is no change in the orientation of LLDPE by merely adding PP fiber into LLDPE matrix. It should be noted that the reflections of PP crystal in Fig.\u00a03 are very weak because of the quiet limited PP fiber content (\u223c10 wt%). However, as shown in Fig.\u00a03 (c)\u2013(e), two diffraction arcs of (110) plane are focused on the equatorial direction of 2D-WAXS patterns of dynamic samples including pure LLDPE and blends with 10% PP fiber. It means that the prolonged shear during DPIM has dramatically improved the orientation level of LLDPE matrix in both pure LLDPE and LLDPE/PP fiber blend. Meanwhile, such shear field can also induce a highly preferential orientation of PP fiber parallel to the shear flow direction along sample thickness up to the oriented zone, which is illustrated by the PLM image of Fig.\u00a04 . It is consistent well with the first supposition discussed above and explains why the dynamic samples have so higher mechanical properties than that of static samples. Although orientation of blends prepared at 160 \u00b0C is a little stronger than that of pure LLDPE and 180 \u00b0C sample, it is still difficult to explain the huge distinction of mechanical properties among them. The distinction may be interpreted by the second supposition namely interfacial coalescent effect, which can be reflected from the SEM image of Fig.\u00a07 (c) and the description about such morphology will be given. As an overall review of PP fiber dispersion and orientation, the SEM fractured surfaces of the composites with low magnification were investigated. Three molding temperatures, 160 \u00b0C, 170 \u00b0C and 180 \u00b0C were used. For dynamic samples, through exerting 1.0 Hz repeatedly shear on the composites during melt solidification, the majority of fiber is aligned parallel to the flow direction along sample thickness up to the oriented zone. An isotropic morphology consisted with randomly oriented lamellae is observed in the core and the PP phase can't be identified unambiguously from the basal PE phase, as shown in Fig.\u00a05 . On the other hand, instead of developing into spherulites, the lamellae form a highly ordered arrangement between the PP fibers at the skin and the oriented zone. They stacked together almost parallel to each other and are aligned approximately perpendicular to the shear direction (also the fiber direction), forming a transcrystalline interphase. Towards the center, a spherulite-like superstructure is seen. Compared between Fig.\u00a05 (b) and (c), a obvious decrease of diameter of PP fiber is detected when the molding temperature is elevated from 160 \u00b0C to 170 \u00b0C. While a complete melting of PP fibers is seen as the molding temperature reaches to 180 \u00b0C, as shown in Fig.\u00a05 (d). In contrast, for static samples always a spherulite-like superstructure is seen along whole sample thickness, as shown in Fig.\u00a06 . Some oriented LLDPE lamellae and oriented PP fibers are expected at the skin even for static samples, due to the high shear rate at the nozzle. However, SEM result does not favor this phenomenon. Up to now, one argument is raised that is how to describe clearly the relationship of structure\u2013property in the as-prepared LLDPE/PP fiber blends. There is a structural hierarchy in the injection-molded bars of dynamic samples, where a dramatic variety of orientation level and crystalline morphology along the thickness can be observed, whereas, the tensile properties represent the macroscopic behavior of whole bar. In both static sample and dynamic sample, the thickness of skin region is so thin that its effect on the macroscopic property could be neglected. For the static samples, the isotropic core region is dominant, which causes the limited improvement in tensile properties although the PP fiber was incorporated. But the mechanical properties of dynamic samples were determined by the anisotropic oriented zone [24] . The prolonged shear function has produced the thick oriented zone around the core and reduced the cross-section area of core region. We have roughly calculated the area percent of core region in the dynamic samples, which was only 4% [25] . So it can be expected that the effect of core region on the mechanical property is weak, while the strengthened tensile properties can be mainly ascribed to the formation of oriented zone. Another possibility that will affect the mechanical property is the heterogeneous dispersion of PP fiber along the thickness in the dynamic sample. The melt enthalpy of PP component in the various regions of dynamic samples containing 10 wt% PP has been calculated through DSC thermograms. The enthalpy values are 7.07, 7.22, and 7.86 J/g in the skin, oriented zone and core, respectively. One would note that the difference between these values is very small, thus the distribution of PP fiber along the whole thickness is uniform. Since the effect of shear can be best demonstrated in the oriented zone, the crystal morphology and interface structure are highlighted at this zone and shown in Fig.\u00a07 . For pure LLDPE in Fig.\u00a07 (a), one observes intertwined lamellae constituting an interlocked lamellar assembly. Some twisted growth is also seen. For LLDPE containing PP fiber composites, an obvious transcrystallization of LLDPE lamellae on PP fibers is observed in Fig.\u00a07 (b). Although the acid treatment has etched the amorphous regions in both LLDPE and PP phases, one can still distinguish the crystalline structures of PE and PP in the SEM image ( Fig.\u00a07 (b)). Inside the PP fiber, the alignment of PP lamella is compact and highly ordered because the fiber has experienced incomplete melting and the original structure could be adequately maintained. So the tightness of ribbon-like structures, indicated as signal A, could represent the PP fibers. Otherwise, in the domains between adjacent PP fibers, the alignment of lamella is loose and the regularity is low, which corresponded well to the crystalline morphology grew from molten LLDPE. These domains representing PE phase are indicated as signal B. This is a typical shish-kebab like structure with PP fiber forming the shish instead of PE and LLDPE lamellae forming the kebab. Between the PP fibers, parallel-stacked lamellae with smaller size are formed. As the molding temperature increases to 180 \u00b0C, a complete melting of PP fibers takes place. A striking change is observed at the interface between the fibers and matrix. Transcrystallization of LLDPE lamellae on PP fibers is observed anymore in Fig.\u00a07 (c). LLDPE lamellae extended from the matrix penetrate into the PP fibers. The boundary becomes rather diffuse. The change in the interfacial structure can be used to explain at least partially the change of tensile properties of the composites with increasing molding temperatures. 4 Conclusion In summary, for dynamic samples, PP fibers are aligned parallel to the flow direction along sample thickness up to the oriented zone, in contrast to that obtained via conventional injection molding where a random orientation of fiber is observed along the whole sample thickness. The presence of oriented PP\u00a0fibers could enhance the orientation of LLDPE, as caused by the transcrystallization of LLDPE lamellae on PP fibers under effect of shear. Molding temperature plays an important role to determine the crystal morphology and mechanical properties as well. As increasing the molding temperature from 160 \u00b0C to 200 \u00b0C, the partial melting of PP fiber is changed to complete melting, accordingly, the transcrystalline morphology changes to the interpenetration and diffused one, resulting in a dramatic decrease of the tensile strength and modulus.

        "abstract": "Periodic patterning of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with semi-crystalline polymers, especially the novel nanohybrid shish kebab (NHSK) superstructure, in which fibrous CNTs act as shish while polymer lamellae as kebab, is of interest both scientifically and technologically. So far the reported NHSK are mostly prepared using polymers with zigzag conformation in crystal and it seems difficult to obtain NHSK using polymer with helical conformation. In this work, we report the formation of NHSK structure by using single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) bundles. A promoted formation of NHSK was observed even using polymer with helical conformation, and the formation mechanism of NHSK was attributed to the unique \"groove structure\" formed by the stacked SWNTs in parallel arrays, which could facilitate the orientation of helical polymer chains along the SWNTs axis and the lateral formation of stable nucleus. The NHSK structure in helical polymer/SWNT bundles system could widen application of this unique superstructure, offering value in both application field and crystallography aspect as well. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

        "title": "Study of PE and iPP orientations on the surface of carbon nanotubes by using molecular dynamic simulations",
        "abstract": "In this study, the early stage of interfacial crystallisation behaviour of low molecular weight polyethylene (PE) and isotactic polypropylene (iPP) oligomer on the surface of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with different diameters, chiralities and topography structures was studied using MD simulations. We started to simulate the effect of CNTs chirality and diameter on PE molecular chain orientation, and then the effect of CNTs topography structure on PE and iPP molecular chain orientation was investigated. Finally, some experiments were carried out to prove the simulated results. Our study shows that for CNTs with a diameter comparable with the radius of gyration (Rg) of a polymer chain, an easy orientation of PE chains along CNTs axis is observed for all the systems of the CNTs with different chiralities due to a geometric confinement effect. For CNTs with a much larger diameter, multiple orientation of PE chains is induced on its surface due to the lattice matching between graphite lattice and PE molecular chains. In this case, the chirality of CNTs dominates the orientation of graphite lattice, which determines the orientation of PE chains arrangement on CNTs surface. More importantly, it was found that the groove structure formed by CNT bundles is very useful for the stabilisation of polymer chain, and thus facilitates the orientation of molecular chain along the long axis of CNTs. As a result, a novel nanohybrid shish-kebab (NHSK) structure with CNTs acting as central shish while polymer lamellae as kebab can be successfully obtained for both PE with zigzag conformation and iPP with helical conformation. This simulation result was well supported by the experimental observation. Our study could provide not only a deep understanding of the origin of the polymer chain orientation on CNTs surface but also the guidance for the preparation of polymer/CNTs nanocomposites with novel NHSK structure. \u00a9 2013 Taylor & Francis.",

Abstract The synergistic effect of \u03b2-modification and annealing on the impact toughness of a commercially available polypropylene random copolymer (PPR) was investigated. Interestingly, the impact toughness of \u03b2-nucleated PPR after annealing at low temperature (0 \u00b0C) was almost five times as high as that of the virgin PPR without annealing. The crystalline structure, supermolecular structure, phase morphology, the relaxation of chain segments and fracture behavior of matrix were investigated to explore the toughening mechanism related to the \u03b2-modification and annealing. It was found that annealing improved the mobility of chain segments in amorphous phase as well as the strength of ligament of PPR matrix with profuse \u03b2 crystals having the intrinsic low plastic deformation resistance, responsible for the superior toughness achieved. This work provides a possible method to toughen semi-crystalline polymers at low temperature by combination of \u03b2-modification and suitable annealing. Keywords Polypropylene random copolymer Toughening Annealing \u03b2-Nucleating 1 Introduction Polypropylene (PP) is one of the most widely used thermoplastic; but its application in some fields is limited especially at low temperature, due to its low impact resistance. The fracture resistance of this semi-crystalline polymer shows dramatic dependence on the ability of shear yielding and crazing [1,2] . The way of promoting extensive shear yielding and/or multiple crazing in the polymer matrix is much beneficial for toughening. As demonstrated in the past studies, various elastomers are thought to be the most efficient toughening agents for PP; but the improvement of fracture toughness is at the cost of deterioration of stiffness and strength [3\u20135] . Instead of adding elastomers, copolymerization of propylene with ethylene or other olefins is another useful and effective method to produce high-performance polypropylene copolymers, PPR [6\u201311] . In this copolymer, the homopolymer sequences are semi-crystalline and form a compound crystalline-amorphous biphase; while the propylene-ethylene random segments with high ethylene content tend to coalesce together to form a rubbery phase. It is indeed a multiphase polyolefin system with an excellent rigidity-toughness balance: the crystalline phase of homopolymer sequences guarantees the moderate strength and modulus, and the well-dispersed rubbery domains offer superior toughness. Therefore, polypropylene random copolymers (PPR) constitute an important class of plastic resins that are widely used as matrix components in pipe, automobile parts, furniture, and other industrial uses in the past two decades, based on the excellent mechanical properties and relatively low production cost [12,13,5] . Even so, it is also found that the toughness of PPR at low temperature (below T g ) is still too low and thus limits its further applications. On the other hand, polypropylene is a polymorphic material with at least four crystalline forms, namely, the monoclinic \u03b1-form, trigonal \u03b2-form, orthorhombic \u03b3-form, and mesomorphic smectic form [14,15] . The differences in the supermolecular structures and the different crystalline states of PP exhibit different mechanical features. For example, the \u03b1-PP shows excellent modulus and tensile strength but inferior fracture toughness because the presence of interlocking effect of the radial lamellae by the tangential crystallites makes the plastic deformation very difficult [16,17] . On the contrary, \u03b2-PP without cross-hatching allows the initiation and propagation of plastic deformation more easily and then enhances the energy dissipation [18\u201321] . Especially, the enhanced toughness of \u03b2-PP can be attributed to a stress-induced transformation from less dense (\u03b2-phase) to more dense (\u03b1-phase) crystalline structure at the root of a growing crack [22,23] . An additional factor that should be responsible for the reducing resistance to plastic flow initiation is the crystallographic symmetry of the hexagonal \u03b2 phase with three equivalent glide planes. This indeed offers a great probability of favourably orientated crystals for slip with regard to the principal shear stress, and allows a more uniform deformation of the \u03b2 lamellae at reduced yield stress. The amorphous phase has also been supposed to take part in the plastic modification of PP containing \u03b2 phase crystals through higher intercrystalline tie chain density [24,25] . On the basis of crystallization kinetics and chain-folding regularity, the amorphous phase is believed to provide an uniform stress distribution over the crystalline lamellae in the case of the \u03b2 phase. A consequence of this is strong strain hardening for the \u03b2-phase that may notably account for the enlargement of the plastic zone at the crack tip. But, only controlling the amount of \u03b2-PP in the materials is not enough to obtain the high toughness. What is worse, some works found that the presence of \u03b2-phase had little effect at low temperature (below T g ) for isotactic polypropylene [26] . Thus, the combination of rubber particles and \u03b2-modification has been considered. Largely improved fracture resistance, as well as the shift of brittle-ductile transition to lower rubber particles volume fraction, has been reported in the literatures [27\u201330] . Recently, the microstructure and mechanical behaviors of \u03b2-PP have also been comparatively researched through annealing process at the elevated temperature between glass transition temperature ( T g ) and melting temperature ( T m ) [31\u201334] . Compared to \u03b1-PP with the interlocked structure, it seems more likely that \u03b2-PP has more potential to be toughened by secondary crystallization occurring in the amorphous phase during annealing. Some works have proved that, at a certain annealing temperature (130 \u00b0C), the fracture resistance of \u03b2-PP can be largely improved [34] . With the improvement of the crystals induced by secondary crystallization, including the degree of crystallinity, molecular arrangement, and lamellae thickness, the fracture toughness in the bulk crystals increases because more fracture energy is required to destroy these improved crystal structure. In addition, the number of chain segments in the amorphous region decreases and some microvoids form, making the lamellae structures looser and more available to slip and/or elongate along the impact direction [34,35] . Although annealing is a useful way to improve the impact strength of \u03b2-PP at room temperature, the effect of annealing on the low temperature toughness of \u03b2-PP is few at hand. In current study, we attempted to improve the toughness of PPR at relatively low temperature by combination of \u03b2-nucleating agent and annealing. The injection-molded bars of PPR with a fixed \u03b2-nucleating agent content of 0.1 wt.% were prepared at 240 \u00b0C, followed by annealing at 110 \u00b0C for 2 h. It was found that the synergistic toughening effect at low temperature (0 \u00b0C), through \u03b2-modification and annealing, was achieved. Numerous characterizations, including polarized light microscopy (PLM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), were performed to disclose the underlying toughening mechanism. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and sample preparation Polypropylene random copolymer (PPR) used in this study was a commercial grade R200P supplied by Hyosung (Korea), with M w = 72.2 \u00d7 10 4 g/mol, M w / M n = 4.5 and density of 0.91 g/cm 3 . The mass percentage of ethylene component was as low as 3.8 wt.%. A small amount of antioxidant (Irganox 1010) was added into PPR to prevent the thermal decomposition during melt processing. The rare earth \u03b2-nucleating agent, marked as WBG, was kindly supplied by Winner Functional Materials Co. (Foshan, Guangdong, China). The PPR and WBG powders were first melt compounded to make a master-batch containing 5 wt.% WBG in a co-rotating twin screw extruder (TSSJ-25 co-rotating twin-screw extruder, China); then, the master-batch and pure PPR were extruded to prepare PPR specimens containing 0.1 wt.% WBG with the setting temperatures of 160\u2013200 \u00b0C from hopper to die and the screw speed of 120 rpm. After making droplets, the pellets were dried at 80 \u00b0C for 12 h. Then, the pellets were injection-molded into standard specimens for testing, conducted on an injection machine (PS40E5ASE, Japan). The melt temperature was set as 240 \u00b0C, and the mould temperature was 30 \u00b0C. For comparison, the neat PPR specimens were also prepared by the identical processing parameters. The specimens were annealed in a vacuum oven at 110 \u00b0C for 2 h, which was an optimized annealing condition. After being annealed, the specimens were cooled in the ambient air. For short, the samples of pure PPR, annealed PPR, \u03b2-nucleated PPR and annealed \u03b2-nucleated PPR were denoted as PPR, PPR-A, \u03b2-PPR and \u03b2-PPR-A, respectively. 2.2 Characterizations and measurements The notched Izod impact strength of the specimens was measured with a VJ-40 Izod machine according to ASTM D256-04. For low temperature impact test, the specimens were keep at 0 \u00b0C for 12 h, and then immediately (less than 5 s) subjected to impact. The average values were obtained over five specimens. Standard tensile tests were performed on a dumbbell-shaped specimen using an SANS Universal tensile testing machine according to the ASTM D638-03 standard. The natural draw ratio \u03bb n was determined from the separation of ink marks at regular 1 mm intervals preprinted on the specimens. A crosshead speed of 50 mm/min was used. In order to examine the crack-initiation stage, an arrested crack in the specimen was produced with a notch Izod part-impact tester at 0 \u00b0C. In detail, the pendulum was raised at an angle of 60\u00b0 from the vertical and then released to hit the specimen. With appropriately chosen impact energy about 0.2 J, the specimen was not broken into two halves, and the propagating crack stopped in the interior of the specimen. For polarized light microscopy (PLM), the slices with a thickness of around 30 \u03bcm were cut from injection-molded specimens directly using a Leica RM2245 microtome, and then inspected on a Leica DMIP PLM equipped with crossed polarizer. Similarly, the crack-initiation patterns of the slices with 30 \u03bcm thick cutting from part-impact specimens were collected by the Leica DMIP optical microscopy. A Philips X\u2019Pert pro MPD apparatus was adopted to acquire WAXD spectra. The analysis method of WAXD spectra was described by Huo et al. [36] . The overall crystallinity, X c , was calculated according to the following equation: (1) X c = \u2211 A c r y s t \u2211 A c r y s t + \u2211 A a m o r p where A cryst and A amorp are the fitted areas of crystal and amorphous region, respectively. While the relative amount of the \u03b2-form crystal, K \u03b2 , was evaluated according to the method of Turner-Jones et al. [37] (2) K \u03b2 = A \u03b2 ( 3 \u2009 0 \u2009 0 ) A \u03b1 ( 1 \u2009 1 \u2009 0 ) + A \u03b1 ( 0 \u2009 4 \u2009 0 ) + A \u03b1 ( 1 \u2009 3 \u2009 0 ) + A \u03b2 ( 3 \u2009 0 \u2009 0 ) where A \u03b2 (3 0 0) is the area of the (3 0 0) reflection peak of \u03b2-form at 2 \u03b8 = 16.1 \u00b0; A \u03b1 (1 1 0) , A \u03b1 (0 4 0) and A \u03b1 (1 3 0) are the areas of the (1 1 0), (0 4 0), and (1 3 0) reflection peaks of \u03b1-form, and correspond to 2 \u03b8 = 14.1\u00b0, 16.9\u00b0 and 18.6\u00b0, respectively. Therefore, the crystallinity of \u03b2-form ( X \u03b2 ) and \u03b1-form ( X \u03b1 ), could be calculated according to the following equation: (3) X \u03b2 = X c \u00d7 K \u03b2 (4) X \u03b1 = X c \u2212 X \u03b2 The calorimetric analysis was conducted on a Perkin-Elmer pyris-1DSC calorimeter calibrated by indium. The mass of testing specimen was around 5 mg. The specimens cut from the injection-molded specimens were directly heated from 30 to 200 \u00b0C at a rate of 10 \u00b0C/min. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) experiments were performed using a Hitachi S3400+EDX SEM instrument with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. The impact fracture surfaces after low temperature test are examined. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) testing was carried out using a DMA Q800 analyzer (TA instruments, USA). The three-point-bend mode was used, and the measurement was carried out on a rectangular shaped part in the size of 30 mm \u00d7 10.2 mm \u00d7 4.2 mm (length \u00d7 wide \u00d7 thickness) from \u221240 to 100 \u00b0C at a heating rate of 3 \u00b0C/min and an oscillatory frequency of 1 Hz. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Toughness and fracture morphology On the basis of the research goal of this study, the notch Izod impact strengths for PPR, PPR-A, \u03b2-PPR and \u03b2-PPR-A were studied at 0 \u00b0C, and the values are plotted in Fig. 1 . It is found that the sample of PPR shows relative low impact strength at this testing temperature. It also shows that the impact strength of PPR has been improved a little by either annealing or \u03b2-modification. However, the sample of \u03b2-PPR-A shows obviously high impact strength (30.2 kJ/m 2 ), which is almost five times as high as that of the virgin PPR (6.5 kJ/m 2 ) and about three times as high as \u03b2-PPR (10.4 kJ/m 2 ). So, it means synergistic effect of annealing and \u03b2-modification for toughening PPR. To clearly understand the variation of fracture resistance at low temperature related to the annealing process, the typical impact-fractured surfaces of \u03b2-PPR and \u03b2-PPR-A were characterized and the results are shown in Fig. 2 . Before annealing, the sample exhibits the typical surface feature of brittle fracture mode. The plastic deformation zone is relative small and smooth, and the weak plastic deformation is concentrated in the region not far away from the crack root. However, after being annealed, the whole fracture surface shows obvious plastic deformation and the extent of plastic deformation increases significantly. At the edge of the sample, a serrated surface can be distinguished, while in the center of the sample, shear deformation is observed. At higher magnification (see Fig. 2 (a2\u20134, b2\u20134)), one can observe shear deformation of the matrix, indicating more energy dissipation during impact fracture. Therefore, annealing induces the brittle-ductile transition of \u03b2-modified PPR. 3.2 Crystallinity and polymorphic composition It is well known that the overall crystallinity and polymorphic composition are two important factors determining the macroscopic toughness of semi-crystalline polymers. To quantitatively estimate the crystallinity ( X c ) and polymorphic composition in the samples, wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) was used. Fig. 3 illustrates the WAXD spectra of PPR, PPR-A, \u03b2-PPR and \u03b2-PPR-A. In these profiles, the (1 1 0) plane at 2 \u03b8 = 14.1\u00b0, (0 4 0) plane at 16.9\u00b0, and (1 3 0) plane at 18.6\u00b0 are the principal reflections for \u03b1-crystals in PPR, while the (3 0 0) plane at about 16.1\u00b0 is the principle reflection of the \u03b2-crystals. Quantitative estimations of total crystallinity ( X c ), relative fraction of \u03b2-form ( K \u03b2 ) and crystallinity of \u03b1-form ( X \u03b1 ) and \u03b2-form ( X \u03b2 ) have been done according to the methods mentioned in Section 2 , and the values are reported in Table 1 . It is shown that the total crystallinity increases after annealing for both virgin PPR and \u03b2-PPR. Moreover, the increase in the total crystallinity after annealing is more likely to result from the increase in the \u03b1-form, because the crystallinity of \u03b2-form is almost equal for both \u03b2-PPR and \u03b2-PPR-A (16% of \u03b2-form crystals). It is similar to some other reports that annealing of PP induces transformation of smectic mesophase into a polymorph without noticeable development of \u03b2 structures [38,39] . On the other hand, some similar results have been achieved through calorimetric analysis (DSC), as shown in Fig. 4 . It is particularly worth noting that an obvious extra annealing melting peak appears in the annealed samples at relatively low temperature. Meanwhile, the original \u03b1 melting peak moves to higher temperature slightly. According to other's works, the low-temperature melting peak was attributed to the melting of thin lamellae formed during the secondary long-time annealing process [34,40] , while the high-temperature melting peak was attributed to the melting of thick lamellae generated from primary crystallization of the injection molding process and then thickening by annealing [41] . Therefore, it can be deduced that annealing at this temperature hardly changes the polymorphic composition, irrespective of adding \u03b2-nucleating agent. According to the DSC result, annealing leads up to somewhat increase in the amount of \u03b1-form, especially thin lamellae of \u03b1 crystal. 3.3 Crystalline morphology Since adding \u03b2-nucleating agent can affect the polymorphic composition and crystal morphology of PPR, the increase in the toughness can also be partly ascribed to the change of crystal morphology induced by \u03b2-nucleating agent. Also, whether the annealing might affect the crystal morphology needs to be further clarified. Thus, the effect of \u03b2-modification and annealing on the crystalline morphology of PPR has been investigated in detail by PLM, as shown in Fig. 5 . For virgin PPR, typical \u03b1-spherulitic morphology is observed for both annealed and unannealed samples. For \u03b2-PPR, the size of crystal sharply decreases while compared with that of virgin PPR. More importantly, a lot of \u03b2-crystals with high birefringence character form into net-framework in the samples. For semi-crystalline polymers, the size and the integrity of spherulites, as well as the boundary strength between spherulites, also influence the fracture resistance [42] . That is to say, the fineness of the crystal structure could be beneficial for increasing of fracture resistance. On the other hand, formation of \u03b2-phase can improve the molecular entanglement between the spherulites, thus giving rise to the increase of the boundary strength between the spherulites. This also contributes to the improvement of fracture resistance [43] . 3.4 Change of amorphous phase Deformation of a semi-crystalline polymer can be viewed as stretching of amorphous network with crystallites as physical cross-links. As Maiti et al. pointed out that annealing of PP at an elevated temperature results in (i) secondary crystallization of a part of the amorphous phase, (ii) thickening of radial lamellae, (iii) development of subsidiary lamellae, and (iv) growth of the crystal perfection [44] . Therefore, the amorphous network must be changed during annealing, reflected by variation of intrinsic deformation parameters, and thus could be responsible for the toughness enhancement. To explore the relationship between the fracture toughness and intrinsic deformation parameters, such as true yield stress and strain hardening modulus, would give a deep insight into the fracture and toughness of semicrystalline polymers. The deformation and failure of polymers can be described with a simplified model based on a stability analysis [45] : (5) \u03c3 t y G = \u03bb n 2 \u2212 ( 1 / \u03bb n ) \u03bb n \u2212 1 where \u03c3 t and G are respectively the intrinsic yield stress and strain hardening modulus and \u03bb n is the estimated \u201cnatural draw ratio\u201d of the neck. Since the stress\u2013strain curves of most injection-molded samples tested show similar behavior with respect to neck drawing, representative nominal stress\u2013strain curves of \u03b2-PPR and \u03b2-PPR-A are plotted only in Fig. 6 , respectively. Under stretching, the samples behave as homogenous elastic deformation, followed by the formation of a stable neck. Stable necking provides an effective way to obtain the ratio of true yield stress \u03c3 t to strain hardening modulus G as long as the natural draw ratio in the neck \u03bb n is known. When equilibrium is reached between the load transferred in the neck and that in the undeformed zone, a stable neck is formed. At this point, the load in the neck will be large enough to induce yield in the adjacent undeformed material. So the true yield stress \u03c3 t can be obtained from the maximum curvature of true tress strain curve around nominal yield point. The results of \u03bb n , \u03c3 t , G and \u03c3 t / G are summarized in Table 2 . It is indicated that lowest values of \u03bb n and \u03c3 t / G exist in the samples with \u03b2 modification and being annealed. The main reasons for these changes might be clarified as follows: firstly, adding \u03b2-nucleating agent in PPR increases the crystallinity, decreases crystalline size and promotes the formation of \u03b2-crystals. Secondly the lamellar structure of \u03b2-crystal is looser than that of \u03b1-crystal. Therefore, the shear deformation ability in crystalline component has been improved. Thirdly, during annealing, secondary crystallization of a part of the amorphous phase increases the junctions of network, which makes large amorphous region can deform as an integrity. Therefore, it can be concluded that the improved toughness in the \u03b2-PPR-A samples is related to the enhanced amorphous phase that could effectively transmit stress from amorphous strands to the adjacent crystallites. On the other hand, the molecular mobility in the amorphous phase is another factor affecting the deformation of amorphous strands and thus toughness. It can be deduced from the mechanical relaxation, as shown in Fig. 7 . After being annealed, the storage modulus ( G \u2032) value of the specimen increases. This can be ascribed to the improvement of crystallinity and crystalline structure during annealing. More importantly, the mechanical loss factor (Tan \u03b4 ) curve is thought to more useful to exhibit the microstructure change [46] . The maximum at low temperature 15 \u00b0C is related to \u03b2 relaxation, accounting for the glass transition of the unrestricted amorphous PP ( T g ), while the peak at the higher temperature 70 \u00b0C is related to \u03b1 c -relaxation, accounting for the relaxation of restricted PP amorphous chains in the crystalline phase (defects), also known as rigid amorphous molecules [47,48] . The T g value of annealed sample moved to lower temperature compared with that of unannealed sample, indicating that annealing promotes the mobility of amorphous chain segments. This can be ascribed to a decrease in the concentration of the chain segments in the amorphous phase due to the second crystallization process relating to the change of some chain segments from amorphous state to crystalline state during the annealing process [34,49,50] . Furthermore, the intensity of \u03b2-relaxation peak of annealed sample exhibits higher value than that of unannealed sample. As is well known, the intensity of \u03b2-relaxation is representative of the maximum energy dissipated because of the viscoelastic relaxation of PP component. This means that, after being annealed, the fracture resistance and damping capacity are improved simultaneously. 3.5 Crack-initiation term and toughening mechanism To determine the synergistic toughening mechanism of \u03b2-modification and annealing for PPR, the crack-initiation term for PPR, PPR-A, \u03b2-PPR and \u03b2-PPR-A has been studied further. Fig. 8 shows the crack-initiation pattern of these samples after the notch Izod part-impact test. For both annealed and unannealed PPR, brittle behavior was observed, and ahead of the crack tip a single craze was visible. It may be caused by the \u03b1-form crystal with weak interaction between the spherulites with a little tie-molecules. On the other hand, for \u03b2-PPR, crack shows a broad craze and a certain amount of stress whitening at the end of the crack, indicating the presence of \u03b2 phase may benefit to the stress whitening. Interestingly, totally different from the front propagation behaviors, multiple crazing and a certain amount of stress whitening remain visible along the tips of the arrested crack for \u03b2-PPR-A. The trajectory of these features at the tip of crack shows obvious shear deform of the matrix. As a result big deform zone and large energy dissipation can be obtained. The toughening mechanism according to the behavior of crack initiation and propagation for \u03b2-PPR-A can be contributed by several factors. Firstly, adding \u03b2-nucleating agent decreases the size of spherulites resulting in more tie molecules between the inter-lamellae. Secondly, as \u03b2 form crystal, the primary lamellar structure is much looser and the entangled chains of inter-lamellae are more than that of \u03b1 form. The effect of the \u03b2-modification is very likely associated with a specifics structure of the amorphous phase induced \u03b2-crystallites [51] . In addition, the \u03b2 phase favors the development of microcavites in deformed PP, which has been widely reported in literature [26,52,53] . Thirdly, after being annealed, the strength of amorphous phase increases according to the increase of junctions of the network by secondary crystallization. Also, the mobility of the chains in amorphous region has been largely improved. Therefore, the craze patterns of the annealed \u03b2-PPR sample show well-propagated branches. Combining all of these factors, the good low temperature impact toughness has been achieved. 4 Conclusion In this work, excellent low temperature impact toughness of polypropylene random copolymer (PPR) was obtained by combining \u03b2-modification and annealing. On the one hand, the decrease in the crystalline size and formation of \u03b2 form reduce the plastic resistance of crystals. On the other hand, because of the second crystallization, the strength of amorphous phase enhances and can transmit stress to the adjacent crystallites. What is more, the enhanced molecular mobility in the amorphous phase is another factor contributing to the high energy dissipation during fracture. This work proves a considerable way to increase the low temperature resistance of semicrystalline polymer by increasing the ability of the shear deformation in the crystalline component, reinforcing amorphous phase and improving molecular mobility in the amorphous region.

In this study, acid-modified multiwalled CNTs (A-MWCNTs) were introduced into polystyrene/maleic anhydride-g-(styrene-ethylene-butadiene-styrene) (PS/SEBS-MA) blends. By altering the mass ratio of PS/SEBS-MA from 80/20 to 60/40, the biphase structure of blend was changed from sea-island-like type to quasi co-continuous structure, of different mechanical behaviors. In 80/20 mass ratio, the impact strength was improved while the tensile strength was unchanged with increasing A-MWCNTs content, whereas a simultaneously toughening and strengthening effect was achieved for the compound with 60/40 mass ratio. Scanning electron microscopy, polarized light microscopy, dynamic mechanical analysis, and rheological measurements were carried out to detect the distribution of A-MWCNTs in the blends. The results demonstrated as increasing the nanotube loading from 0 to 3 wt%, A-MWCNTs might gradually migrate into continuous PS phase in 80/20 mass ratio, due to the low content of SEBS-MA, while they were totally packed in SEBS-MA region within the entire loading range used in 60/40 mass ratio due to its high content of SEBS-MA. This study provides guidance on the design and preparation of high performance ternary polymer/elastomer/inorganic filler composites. \u00a9 2011 Society of Plastics Engineers Copyright \u00a9 2011 Society of Plastics Engineers.",

The true draw ratio at break and permanent strain of broken samples after total shrinkage at 140\u00b0C for 10 min demonstrate that entangled amorphous network undergoes more significant relaxation in the sample with lower molecular weight. With aid of Essential Work of Fracture (EWF) method, most of importance, the fracture toughness of ductile polyethylene is effectively evaluated and can be directly related to the network modulus. Furthermore, fracture toughness is strain rate dependent and can be enhanced to some extent by suppressing relaxation of entangled network. \u00a9 2007 The Society of Polymer Science.",

        "title": "Effect of surface wettability on transparency in different water conditions",
        "abstract": "Water droplets or films which are formed according to surface wettability show different effects on surface transparency. The effects of surface wettability on transparency in different water conditions are worth investigating because the surface usually suffers from the variable environmental water conditions. Herein, superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic surfaces, with negligible differences of physical structure but great differences of chemical composition, are used to investigate for the first time the relationship between surface wettability and transparency in four water conditions, including ambient condition, liquid water, boiling water steam, and ambient conditions after freezing at -4 C for 1 week. The transparency of the superhydrophobic surface is only about 5% lower in 550 nm light wavelength than that of the superhydrophilic surface in ambient conditions, but it is about 24% lower than that of the superhydrophilic surface in liquid water. When the surfaces are exposed to boiling water steam and ambient conditions after freezing at -4 C for 1 week, the superhydrophobic surface also shows lower transparency than the superhydrophilic surface because of increased fogging. However, the transparency shows little difference when the fog evaporates completely. The relationship revealed between surface wettability and transparency in different water conditions will be beneficial in choosing suitable wettability surfaces to satisfy the needed transparency in actual applications. Graphical Abstract: The effect of surface wettability on transparency has been quantitatively studied with a commercial UV-Vis spectrometer in ambient conditions (a, air) and in liquid water (a, water), and qualitatively studied with the fogging phenomenon in boiling water steam (b) and in ambient conditions after freezing at -4 C for 1 week (c) for hydrophilic glass substrates (left in b and c), superhydrophobic surfaces (middle in b and c), and superhydrophilic surfaces (right in b and c).[Figure not available: see fulltext.] \u00a9 2013 American Coatings Association & Oil and Colour Chemists' Association.",

        "abstract": "To extend the application of a carbon dioxide sourced environmental friendly polymer: poly (propylene carbonate) (PPC), a small amount of maleic anhydride (MA) was melt blended to end-cap with PPC to improve its thermal stability and mechanical properties. Thermal and mechanical properties of end-capped PPC were investigated by TGA, GPC, mechanical test, and DMA. TGA and titration results demonstrate that PPC can be easily end-capped with MA through simple melt blending. TGA results show that the thermal degradation temperature of PPC could be improved by around 140\u00b0C by adding MA. GPC measurement indicates that the molecular weight of PPC can be maintained after blending with MA, where pure PPC experiences a dramatic degradation in molecular weight during melt process. More importantly, the tensile strength of PPC after blending with MA was found to be nearly eight times higher than that of pure PPC. It has approached the mechanical properties of polyolefin polymers, indicating the possibility of replacing polyolefin polymers with PPC for low temperature applications. The method described here could be used to extend the applications of PPC and fight against the well known global warming problem. \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The morphological observation by scanning electronic microscope (SEM) indicated that PC phase in situ generated more and finer microfibrils in the dynamic samples than in the static ones, and the CNTs predominantly localized in the PC microfibrils without obvious migration to PE matrix and also aligned along the microfibrils. With such unique morphology, the tensile properties of the dynamic samples were simultaneously considerably increased compared to their complementary samples, especially in the presence of 0.5 wt% of CNTs, which indicates both stretch alignment of CNTs and molecule orientation can bring out a significant reinforcement on PE. Furthermore, the static samples displayed double yielding points in on the stress\u2013strain curves, and interestingly, a small quantity of CNTs in PC fibrils strengthened this phenomenon.",

        "abstract": "In this work, raw multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) without any pre-treatment were blended with linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), then molded via a so-called Dynamic Packing Injection Molding (DPIM) technique, in which oscillatory shear was exerted on the prepared composites during the stage of cooling solidification. The injection molded samples were extracted by xylene to remove LLDPE, and the remained MWNTs were collected and characterized. Shear enhanced interfacial adhesion between MWNTs and LLDPE was confirmed by dissolution experiment and Fourier transform infrared. The former a longer mixing time in xylene for remained MWNTs compared with raw MWNTs, while in the latter an increased intensity of characteristic LLDPE peak for MWNTs subjected to dynamic packing injection molding. More importantly, SEM images showed a formation of MWNTs/LLDPE nanohybrid shish-kebab, in which MWNTs served as shish, and LLDPE lamellae as kebab and periodically decorated on MWNTs. A simultaneously improved tensile strength and elongation of LLDPE have been achieved by adding the LLDPE-decorated MWNTs. Our work provides a new way for the modification of MWNTs, particularly a convenient way for the enhancement of interfacial adhesion in polymer/MWNT composites via realistic molding processing. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "In this work, we investigated the epitaxial crystallization and its determinant factor in the blends of high density polyethylene (HDPE) and a low crystallizable propylene-ethylene random copolymer (PPR) during injection molding. For PPR dominated blend (blended with 30 wt.% HDPE), epitaxial growth of HDPE on the PPR crystals can be achieved, as demonstrated by two-dimensional wide-angle X-ray diffraction and small-angle X-ray scattering measurements, though the crystallization of PPR was far behind that of HDPE component under quiescent conditions. In-situ shear infrared experiments indicated that PPR crystallized in advance mainly due to larger crystallization window and flow-induced crystallization acceleration. As for the blend with 70 wt.% HDPE, however, one could not observe epitaxy. Shear-induced crystallization of HDPE hindered its epitaxial growth. Once the formation of shish-kebab of HDPE was activated, the epitaxial growth would be suppressed to a large extent. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, EPDM rubber and nano-SiO 2 particles were employed to modify PP simultaneously. Our goal was to control the distribution and dispersion of EPDM and nano-SiO 2 particles in PP matrix by using an appropriate processing method and adjusting the wettability of nano-SiO 2 particles toward PP and EPDM, so as to achieve a simultaneous enhancement of toughness and modulus of PP. With regard to this, two kinds of nano-SiO 2 particles (with hydrophilic or hydrophobic) as well as two processing methods (one-step or two-step) were employed to prepare PP/EPDM/SiO 2 ternary composites. A unique structure with the majority of EPDM particles surrounded by SiO 2 particles was first observed by using hydrophilic SiO 2 and two-step processing method, resulting in a dramatically increase of Izod impact strength as the rubber content in the range of brittle\u2013ductile transition (15\u201320 wt%). The observation that poor adhesion and poor compatibility between particles and PP matrix could result in a significant increase in Izod impact strength was unusual and needed further investigation. This could be tentatively understood as a consequence of the overlap of the \u2018stress volume\u2019 between EPDM and SiO 2 particles due to the formation of the unique structure. Our work provided a deep understanding of the toughening mechanism and a new way for the preparation of high performance polymer composites.",

        "abstract": "In this study, a simple but effective method to realize excellent comprehensive performances in polypropylene (PP)/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) was developed. Before melt extrusion, solid-state iPP powders and MWNTs were pre-mixed upon high-speed rotating. By this way, the dispersion extent of nanotubes was significantly improved as comparing to the common one-step melt extrusion strategy. As validated by scanning electron microscopy, most of MWNTs exist as a form of filament bundles with size of hundreds nanometers; no obvious agglomerate was found even at high MWNTs content, 5%. The improvements of the major mechanical properties and electric conductivity were much efficient for the composites obtained via the two-step process of rotating solid-state mixing (RSSM)- plus -melt extrusion. The tensile strength, Young\u2019s modulus and impact strength at 5% MWNTs content were enhanced for 35%, 42% and 45%, respectively, indicating an excellent strength\u2013rigidity\u2013toughness balance, which was hardly achieved in polyolefin/carbon nanotubes composite. It is believed that the method developed in this study is so far the most effective and convenient for efficiently dispersing nanotubes into the nonpolar, intractable thermoplastics and resulting in good properties, among a variety of fabrication method suggested in the previous researches. Importantly, the used RSSM equipment is a kind of frequently used dispersion machine, thus it has tremendous potential to be applied in industrial producing immediately.",

The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (TFs) play a vital role in plant growth and development, metabolic regulation processes and responses to environmental changes. However, systematic analyses of the bHLH TF family in lotus has not yet been reported. Here, we report the identification and description of bHLH genes in lotus () with a focus on functional prediction, particularly for those involved in stress resistance. In all, 115  were identified in the lotus genome and classified into 19 subfamilies. The chromosomal distribution, physicochemical properties, bHLH domain, conserved motif compositions and evolution of these 115  were further analyzed. To better understand the functions of the lotus bHLH family, gene ontology, cis-element, and phylogenetic analyses were conducted.  were predicted to be involved in plant development, metabolic regulation and responses to stress, in accordance with previous findings. Overall, 15  were further investigated with functional prediction via quantitative real-time PCR analyses. Meanwhile, expression profiles of  in four tissues indicated that many  showed tissue preference in their expression. This study is supposed to provide a good foundation for further research into the functions and evolution of , and identifies candidate genes for stress resistance in lotus.",

The preparation of poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/graphene nanocomposites is realized using two simple steps: the synthesis of PVA/graphite oxide (GO) nanocomposites film and immersion of such a film in the reducing agent aqueous solution. This method prohibits the agglomeration of GO during direct reduction in PVA/GO aqueous solution, and opens a new way to scale up the production of graphene nanocomposites using a simple reducing agent. A 40% increase in tensile strength and 70% improvement in elongation at break have been obtained with only the addition of 0.7 wt.% of reduced graphite oxide. Furthermore, a good level of conductivity and a variation in the surface property of the prepared films have been observed for the composites containing graphene.",

        "abstract": "In this communication, by means of stress relaxation experiments, the viscous stress at various strains during tensile deformation of oriented polyolefin samples including high density polyethylene (HDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) and isotactic polypropylene (iPP), has been determined. The viscous stress in the oriented samples takes up to 50%-70% of the total stress, which is unusually high compared with their isotropic counterparts. The unusual high viscous stress was discussed based on mainly the existence of shish structure in oriented polyolefins, which could enhance the inter-lamella coupling significantly. \u00a9 2007 World Scientific.",

        "abstract": "In this study, good dispersion status of graphite in a nonpolar, intractable polymer, i.e. polypropylene (PP), was realized in melt processing by using a specific dynamic packing injection molding (DPIM) technique. The exfoliation extent of graphite increased remarkably from the skin zone to the core zone of the molded part, as confirmed by combination of WAXD, SEM and TEM analyses, indicating an accelerated exfoliation occurred during the DPIM processing. This phenomenon is due to decreased melt flow channel and increased melt viscosity as the solidification takes place from the wall into the center, which leads to greatly increased shear force. The good dispersion of graphite results in obvious reinforcements of both tensile strength and impact strength by adding moderate amount of graphite. The present study proposes a promising route for realizing the large-scale fabrication of structural parts of polymer/exfoliated-graphite nanocomposites with excellent mechanical properties. \u00a9 2013 Chinese Chemical Society, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

        "abstract": "The cooling process of isotactic polypropylene (iPP)/organoclay nanocomposites was followed by dynamic rheometry. Contrasting to typical linear increment of log G' with decreasing temperature (log G' \u221d 1/T) occurred on the melts for neat iPP and nanocomposites with small amounts of organoclay, an unusual rheological behavior was identified for composites with relative high organoclay content (\u22655 wt %) as that: increasing of log G' positively deviates to linear relation during cooling within certain high temperature region, thus yields an additional enhancement in viscoelastic properties. Furthermore, such unusual rheological phenomenon was found to be strongly impacted by initial dispersion level of organoclay, cooling rate, and construction of organoclay network. The origin of this unusual rheological phenomenon could be cautiously explained as due to the existence of unstable state of organoclay nanostructure, which could go further intercalation or exfoliation in some high temperature ranges. This might be a new rheological character and is meaningful for understanding the essentially structural behavior of polymer/layered clay nanocomposites, particularly containing mesoscopic clay network. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "The evaluation of microstructure and crystal morphology in injected-molded bar becomes much complicated because of the existence of a shear gradient and a temperature gradient from the skin to the core of the samples. To understand the relationship between shear rate-molecular weight and oriented structure of injection molded bar, in this work, the hierarchy structure and the effect of molecular weight on the formation of shish-kebab structure were investigated by examining the lamellar structure of injection molded samples of high density polyethylene (HDPE) with different melt flow index (MFI), layer by layer, along the sample thickness. To enhance the shear effect, so-called dynamic packing injection molding (DPIM), in which the melt is firstly injected into the mold and then forced to move repeatedly in a chamber by two pistons that move reversibly with the same frequency as the solidification progressively occurs from the mold wall to the molding core part, was used to obtain the molded bar. Furthermore, a small amount of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) was added into HDPE to explore the effect of UHMWPE on the crystal morphology and orientation. Our results indicated (1) that the overall orientation in the molded bar increased with decreased MFI, and a small amount of UHMWPE could enhance substantially HDPE orientation; (2) at the skin, there existed intertwined lamellae constituting an interlocked lamellar assembly, a typical shish-kebab structure gradually developed from the subskin-layer to the core, with increased shish content toward the center, but in the core was a spherulite-like superstructure with randomly distributed lamellae; (3) UHMWPE played an important role not only in the formation of shish, but also in the transformation from spherulite to shish-kebab oriented structure for HDPE with a low molecular weight (high MFI).",

The LGO sheets were synthesized by choosing large parent graphite, mild oxidation condition and a two-step centrifugation. The different-sized GO samples prepared under different ultrasonication times, are characterized by Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. It is found that the size of the GO sheets, which has a Gaussian distribution, decreases from 231 to 17 \ufffd\ufffdm2 as the ultrasonication time increases. Moreover, the ultrasonication not only can exfoliate and break GO sheets, but also increase the oxidation degree of GO sheets, especially when the GO sheets have a weak oxidation degree. It is reasonable to believe that the size of GO sheets is closely correlated to the C-O content, which enables the size of GO sheets to be controlled. Our work demonstrates that ultrasonication is an important method to control the size and the oxidation degree of GO sheets, to a certain extent. ? 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

With an increase of PS content up\n to 30 wt%, the tensile strength of PP/PS blends increased from 37.4 MPa to 42.2 MPa, although the blends were widely regarded\n as immiscible. The DSC results showed that there's slight decrease in melting temperature of PP, showing insufficient evidence\n for partial compatibility between PP and PS. Almost no variation of distinct characterization peaks were observed in FTIR\n spectra of PS/PP blends compared with those of neat PP and PS, indicating there is no chemical interactions between PP and\n PS. Since the morphology investigation showed a droplet structure as PS content was up to 30 wt%, the improvement of tensile\n strength could be simply considered as due to the reinforcing effect of dispersed rigid PS particles on the PP, combining\n with partial compatibility between them as evaluated by change of C\n \n p\n  at glass transition for both PS and PP. More interestingly, DSC and DMA results showed that the blending of PS and PP could\n lead to a substantial decrease of the glass transition temperature (T\n g) of PP, and increase of T\n g of PS. The annealing experiment was carried out to understand the change of T\n g in PP/PS blends. It is believed that the compressive stress generated by the contracting PP should be the dominant mechanism\n for the T\n g elevation of PS. On the other hand, the T\n g decrease of PP is likely owing to the creation of a large amount free interface of PP and the dilatation of the PP phase\n resulting from the corresponding tension exerted by PS during cooling.",

        "abstract": "In our work, a novel modifier, quaternary phosphorus salt, (1-hexadecyl) triphenylphosphonium bromide (HTPB), was introduced for the noncovalent functionalization of graphene for the first time. With it, an excellent dispersion of graphene in organic solvent and later in poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) matrix has been achieved, e.g., transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows a single-layer dispersion and multi-layer structure of graphene sheets in PVDF matrix. As a result, the films exhibit outstanding electric property with a very low percolation threshold of 0.662. wt% being observed. Their dielectric property is also improved, the dielectric constant of PVDF/graphene composites at 1000. Hz with a loading lower than 0.86. wt% shows an obvious increase (more than 3 times of that of PVDF at most), while the dielectric loss remain quite low (all lower than 0.07). Even more intriguingly, the quaternary phosphorus salt also induces dominant polar \ufffd\ufffd and \ufffd\ufffd crystalline forms in the prepared composite films. These PVDF/graphene films with good electric and dielectric property as well as dominant polar \ufffd\ufffd and \ufffd\ufffd forms promise a wide range of potential applications in electronic devices. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "In this work, polypropylene (PP)/octene-ethylene copolymer (POE) blends were injection-molded using the socalled dynamic packing injection technique, which imposed oscillatory shear on the gradually cooling melt during the packing solidification stage. In this way, the effect of shear on the size distribution and anisotropy of the minor phase droplets could be investigated. Besides, by using two kinds of POE with different octene contents, the effect of component miscibility was also studied. The results show that the droplet size is mainly determined by composition and miscibility, and droplet anisotropy is mainly determined by droplet size and shear. Most importantly, under the same processing condition, droplet anisotropy increases with droplet size, and there seems a linear fit between them, disregarding the miscibility factor. These results may provide guidance for preparing polymer blends with desired properties by tailoring their phase morphologies. ? 2014 Chinese Chemical Society Institute of Chemistry, CAS Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

Recently, more work is focused on the possibility that using filler as a compatibilizer for immiscible polymer blends. In this article, we reported our efforts on the change of phase morphology and properties of immiscible polypropylene(PP)/polystyrene(PS) blends compatibilized with nano-SiO 2 particles. The effects of filler content and mixing time on the phase morphology, crystallization behavior, rheology, and mechanical properties were investigated by SEM, DSC, ARES and mechanical test. A drastic reduction of PS phase size and a very homogeneous size distribution were observed by introducing nano-SiO 2 particles in the blends at short mixing time. However, at longer mixing time an increase of PS size was seen again, indicating a kinetics-controlled compatibilization. This conclusion was further supported by the unchanged glass transition temperature of PS and by increased viscosity in the blends after adding nano-SiO 2 particles. The compatibilization mechanism of nano-SiO 2 particles in PP/PS blends was proposed based on kinetics consideration.",

An effective approach to prepare PPC environment-friendly composites is shown. The obtained PPC/CNCs nanocomposites display orders of magnitude increase in mechanical properties by adding a small amount of CNCs, in particular, with only 0.1. wt% of CNCs incorporated, a 10-fold increase in tensile strength and 7-fold increase in Young's modulus were achieved. The thermal stability of the nanocomposites is significantly improved as measured by dynamic mechanical analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. This is due to a combination of CNCs reinforcement in the soft matrix and increased effective molecular weight of the nanocomposties.

        "abstract": "For optimum reinforcement in polymer nanocomposite, a critical challenge is to realize the full 'nano-effect' of nanofillers at a high content, which is largely hindered by the strong tendency to aggregation of nanofillers. Here, by using a solvent-exchange and solution casting approach, we could incorporate a high-content graphene oxide (GO) into a soft biodegradable CO2-based poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) up to 20 wt% with excellent dispersion. Based on this, the distributed architecture of GO could be tuned from a 'GO dotted dispersion' and 'GO network' to strong 'GO co-continuous structure' with increasing GO content. As a result, a very strong 'nano-effect' of GO in the PPC matrix was observed: (1) the glass transition temperature of PPC was improved from 25 to 45 \u00b0 C for slightly confined molecular chains, and even to 100 \u00b0 C for highly confined ones; (2) the modified PPC showed drastically enhanced high-temperature mechanical properties, comparable to those of traditional polymers such as polypropylene (PP) and biopolymer poly(lactic acid) (PLA); and (3) such modified PPC exhibited an exciting solvent resistance compared to neat PPC. Our work provides an example to improve the high-temperature properties of a polymer via formation of filler co-continuous structure.",

        "abstract": "In this article, tensile properties have been discussed in terms of phase morphology, crystallinity and molecular orientation in the HDPE/iPP blends, prepared via dynamic packing injection molding, with aid of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) as well as two dimensional X-ray scattering (2D WAXS). For the un-oriented blends, the tensile properties (tensile strength and modulus) are mainly dominated by the phase morphology and interfacial adhesion related to the influenced crystallization between HDPE and iPP component. A maximum in tensile strength and modulus is found at iPP content in the range of 70\u201380 v/v%. As for the oriented blends, however, the presence of dispersed phase in the blends, independent of phase morphology and crystallinity, always makes tensile properties to be deteriorated through reducing molecular orientation of matrix. It is molecular orientation of matrix that determines the tensile properties of oriented blends. In the blends with HDPE as matrix, steep decreasing of tensile properties is related to the rapid reducing of molecular orientation of HDPE, whereas in the blends with iPP as a major component, slight decreasing of molecular orientation of iPP results in slight reducing of tensile properties. Other factors, such as interfacial properties and phase morphology, seem to be little contribution to the modulus and tensile strength.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, electrical and mechanical properties of Poly ( p -phenylene sulfide) (PPS)/multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) nanocomposites were reported. The composites were obtained just by simply melt mixing PPS with raw MWNTs without any pre-treatment. The dispersion of MWNTs and interfacial interaction were investigated through SEM &TEM and Raman spectra. The rheological test and crystallization behavior were also investigated to study the effects of MWNTs concentration on the structure and chain mobility of the prepared composites. Though raw MWNTs without any pre-treatment were used, a good dispersion and interaction between PPS and MWNTs have been evidenced, resulting in a great improvement of electrical properties and mechanical properties of the composites. Raman spectra showed a remarkable decrease of G band intensity and a shift of D bond, demonstrating a strong filler\u2013matrix interaction, which was considered as due to \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking between PPS and MWNTs. The storage modulus ( G \u2032) versus frequency curve presented a plateau above the percolation threshold of about 2\u20133 wt% with the formation of an interconnected nanotube structure, indicative of \u2018pseudo-solid-like\u2019 behavior. Meanwhile, a conductive percolation threshold of 5 wt% was achieved and the conductivity of nanocomposites increased sharply by several orders of magnitude. The difference between electrical and rheological percolation threshold, and the effect of critical percolation on the chain mobility, especially on crystallization behavior of PPS, were discussed. In summary, our work provides a simple and fast way to prepare PPS/MWNTs nanocomposites with good dispersion and improved properties. Keywords A. Nano composites A. Carbon nanotubes B.

Because the phase morphology and crystal morphology compete with each other, it is difficult to control the degree of the micro phase separation in an ordinary way, but with the special method of oscillating packing injection molding at a low pressure, the fine structure combined with micro-phase separation and phase morphology which was studied with SEM method can be controlled to a certain extent. The high tensile strength and high toughness of HDPE/PP blends were got within the PP content in the range from 5% to 20%. The key properties of the blend were as follows: tensile strength and notched impact strength of HDPE/PP (92/8) blend specimens in the oscillating packing are 97.1 MPa and 45. 5 kJ/m2, 4. 3 times and 9. 5 times of the static packing specimens respectively.",

        "abstract": "In this work, halloysite nanotubes (HNTs), a new type of inexpensive filler, were used for the modification of polypropylene (PP). HNTs were first surface treated by methyl, tallow, bis-2-hydroxyethyl, quaternary ammonium, then melt mixed with PP. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to examine the dispersion of HNTs in PP matrix. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarized light microscope (PLM), dynamic melt rheometry and wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) were employed to investigate the crystallization behavior of the prepared PP/HNT composites. The mechanical properties were evaluated by Instron and impact tests. SEM results revealed that HNTs could be well-dispersed in PP matrix and had a good interfacial interaction with PP, even up to a high content of 10 wt%. DSC data indicated that HNTs could serve as a nucleation agent, resulting in an enhancement of the overall crystallization rate and the non-isothermal crystallization temperature of PP. PLM showed a constant spherulite growth rate and a decreased spherulite size at given isothermal crystallization temperature, suggesting that nucleation and growth of a spherulite are two independent processes. The result obtained by dynamic melt rheometry indicated that HNTs mainly promoted nucleation and had not much influence on the growth of PP crystallization. Nevertheless, by fast cooling the samples, almost constant spherulite size can be obtained for both pure PP and PP/HNT composites due to the limited nucleation effect of HNTs on PP crystallization. WAXD showed that HNTs mainly facilitated \u03b1-crystal form of PP. Though a good dispersion of HNTs in PP matrix was observed, out of our expectation, not much enhancement on mechanical properties of PP/HNT composites had been achieved, and this could be mainly ascribed to the constant crystallinity and spherulite size of PP as well as the small length/diameter ratio of HNTs.",

        "abstract": "Biodegradable poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) matrix composite with a significant improvement in yield strength was successfully prepared by incorporating a low content of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) via a supercritical carbon dioxide route. Atomic force microscopy measurement shows that the size of the dispersed PMMA phase in the PPC substrate is in the range from 50 nm to 200 nm, which is much smaller than the smallest ones that can be obtained by conventional melt blending method. Tensile tests demonstrate the excellent mechanical properties of the composites prepared in this study. By incorporating only 5 wt% PMMA, the obtained composites show approximately 4 times higher yield strength than pure PPC and the elongation at break of the composites is well remained. By comparing with the reported works, this method shows the highest enhancement efficiency of PPC. The significant reinforcement of PPC is ascribed to the nano size phase-separated domains of rigid PMMA. These findings show an effective modification method of PPC for the potential alternative to the non-biodegradable polymers. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "In this work, in order to investigate the combined effect of whiskers nucleation ability and shearing function on the interfacial crystal morphology of HDPE/raw whiskers composites, two different types of raw whiskers (SMCW and BW) with different diameter distribution and HDPE composites were firstly prepared by melt blending and then subjected to both traditional and dynamic injection molding. The results indicated that the nucleation ability of SMCW on HDPE crystallization is much better than BW. Furthermore, the small diameter whisker shows the better nucleation ability than the large diameter whisker. For samples prepared by traditional injection molding, the better the nucleation ability of the whisker, the more dense the HDPE crystal lamellae can epitaxially grow on its surface. However, after introducing shearing function, even for large diameter BW whisker with weak nucleation ability, a large number of HDPE crystal lamellae could be epitaxially grown on the surface of the whisker. As a consequence, the interfacial adhesion and mechanical properties of the composites are significantly improved by introducing shear function.",

        "title": "Phase morphology and toughening mechanism of polyamide 6/EPDM-g-MA blends obtained via dynamic packing injection molding",
        "abstract": "One of the most important findings in polymer-toughening is known as the critical matrix ligament thickness ( \u03c4 c ) theory, which is directly related to both rubber concentration and average size of particles. All these studies assume that rubber particles are spherical and randomly distributed in the matrix. Rubber particles may be stretched and oriented along the shear flow direction in real processing. In this paper the effect of stretched and oriented rubber particles on the impact strength of PA6/EPDM- g -MA blends have been studied via dynamic packing injection molding (DPIM). The impact strength of specimens obtained by DPIM was found substantially increase at all the blends investigated, compared with the one obtained via conventional injection molding. Particularly, more than 30 kJ m \u22122 increase of the impact strength was observed for specimens with a higher rubber content (more than 15 wt%). SEM results showed a remarkably decrease of rubber particle size and more uniform dispersion of the dynamic molded specimens. This can be attributed to the shear induced reaction at the interface between polyamide 6 and EPDM- g -MA during the packing stage. The rubber particles were found stretched along the melt shear flow direction when it is content above 15 wt%. A master curve can be also constructed by plotting the impact strength versus the inter-particle distance, indicating that Wu's criterion still works for blends with stretched and oriented rubber particles when the crack propagation direction is perpendicular to the orientation direction of rubber particles. The observed higher impact strength in dynamic specimens could be due to, in part, the enhanced flexural stiffness, which will absorb more energy during impact process when the fracture of IZOD bars is incomplete, but more importantly due to the existence of the stretched and oriented rubber particles, which are more efficient in slowing the velocity of crack propagation and thus cause higher impact resistance when the fracture propagation direction is perpendicular to the rubber oriented direction. Keywords PA6/EPDM- g -MA blends Shear Stretched and oriented rubber particles 1 Introduction Polyamides, as other semi-crystalline polymers, such as isotactic polypropylene and linear polyethylene, are notch sensitive because of their low resistance to crack propagation, which leads to embrittlement at high strain rate or low temperature. A lot of work has been done on the toughening of polyamides by incorporation of fine particles, particularly, by using rubber particles [1\u201312] . Most of these studies focused on two parameters, rubber particle size [3,8] and rubber concentration [8] , until Wu combined these two interdependent parameters into one parameter, inter-particle distance or inter-particle ligament thickness ( \u03c4 c ) [1] . A sharp brittle to ductile transition occurs when the inter-particle distance is below a critical value, which is just a specific material characteristic. The theory, which has also created much controversy, has been further clarified by Muratoglu et al. [9,10,13] . They proposed that specially oriented crystalline layers perpendicular to the interface would prevent premature fracture when these layers percolated over the whole material. And furthermore, Wu's theory has a prerequisite: the rubber particles are considered as spherical and randomly distributed in the matrix. If the rubber particles are stretched and oriented, the stress field around a particle will be more complicated than that of spherical rubber particles, does the \u03c4 c criterion still work? So it is interesting to control not only the rubber particle size and rubber content but also the particle shape to fully understand the toughening mechanism. The shape of rubber in polymer matrix is influenced by the following four factors [16\u201327] : (1) processing conditions; (2) blends composition; (3) interface interaction; (4) viscosity ratio of the components. In recent years, dynamic packing injection molding (DPIM) had been found to be a very effective way of controlling polymer morphology [28\u201332] . The main feature of DPIM is after the melt was injected into the mold it is forced to move repeatedly in a chamber by two pistons moving reversibly with the same frequency, because of the shear field induced by pistons, a multi-layer specimen was obtained during the solidification progress. In this work, the effect of stretched and oriented rubber particles via DPIM on the impact strength of PA6/EPDM- g -MA blends was investigated. Our purpose is to verify whether Wu's criterion still works for blends with stretched and oriented rubber particles along the shear flow direction and to find out in what way will the stretched and oriented rubber particles affect the impact strength of PA6/EPDM- g -MA blends. 2 Experimental 2.1 Material and specimen preparation Studies were performed on blends based on a commercial grade of polyamide 6(B3S, BASF) and ethylene\u2013propylene\u2013diene monomer grafted with maleic anhydride (CG700, ChenGuang chemical institution) with a grafted rate of 0.92%. The melt flow index (MFI at 230 \u00b0C and 2.16 kg load) and density of polyamide 6 were 36 g/10 min and 1.13 g/cm 3 , respectively, while that of EPDM- g -MA were 5 g/10 min (230 \u00b0 C and 2.16 kg load) and 0.84 g/cm 3 , respectively. Blends were prepared in different proportion of polyamide 6 with 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 wt% of the EPDM- g -MA in a TSSJ-2S co-rotating twin-screw extruder. The barrel temperature and the screw speed were set at 190\u2013220\u2013230\u2013230\u2013220 \u00b0C and 120 rpm, respectively. While the droplets got from extruder were molded both with DPIM and traditional injection molding for comparison under the same processing parameter. The schematic representation of DPIM is shown in Fig. 1 . The obtained specimens are dumbbell shape. The shear rate is about 10 s \u22121 calculated from the geometry of mold. The specimens obtained from DPIM and traditional injection moldings are called dynamic specimens and static specimens, respectively. The processing parameters in DPIM are listed in Table 1 . Prior to extrusion and injection molding the materials were vacuum oven-dried for 24 h at 80 \u00b0C. 2.2 Mechanical testing The central part of specimens (40\u00d76\u00d73.5 mm 3 ) which was not standard was used for impact testing. The notches with 45\u00b0 were made at a depth of 1 mm thus the depth of the remaining part was 5.0 mm. The impact experiment was carried out on an I200XJU-2.75 Impact Tester according to ISO 180. The fracture propagation direction is perpendicular to the melt shear flow direction. Since the blends with rubber content higher than 15 wt% are of very high toughness, the fracture is incomplete. The IZOD bars bend and the pendulum swings by. In this case, only the area of the fractured part was used for calculation and the un-fractured part was deducted. Flexural properties were determined in three-point bending mode in an RG T-10 University Testing Machine according to ASTM standard D790. The crosshead speed and span distance used were 2 mm min \u22121 and 70 mm, respectively. The values of all the mechanical parameters were calculated as averages over 6\u20139 specimens for each composition. 2.3 Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) The WAXD experiments were conducted with a siemens D500 diffractometer. The wavelength of the monochromated X-ray from Cu K \u03b1 radiation is 0.154 nm and the reflection mode was used. The scanning 2 \u03b8 range was 5\u201340\u00b0 with a scanning rate of 5\u00b0/min. 2.4 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) The melting behavior of both dynamic and static specimens was studied on a Perkin\u2013Elmer DSC Priys-1. The instrument was calibrated using indium as standard. Melting endotherms were recorded at 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 heating rate from 4 to 5 mg specimen in a nitrogen atmosphere. The degree of crystallinity was calculated from heat of fusion using 190 J g \u22121 as the heat of fusion of 100% crystalline polyamide 6 [33] . 2.5 Scanning electron microscope (SEM) The specimens were cryogenically fractured perpendicular to the shear flow direction and parallel to the shear flow direction in liquid nitrogen, called T and F direction, respectively. Then the cryogenically fractured specimens were etched in boiled toluene for 1 h to selectively dissolve the rubber particles. After the surface was coated with gold powder the phase morphology was observed in a Hitachi X-650 SEM instrument operating at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. 3 Results 3.1 Mechanical properties Fig. 2 shows the impact strength of dynamic and static specimens as a function of rubber content. For pure polyamide 6, the result that the impact strength is nearly the same for dynamic and static specimens implies the orientation of polyamide 6 macromolecules along shear flow direction is difficult due to very low melt viscosity and the strong interaction between macromolecules caused by hydrogen-bonds [34] . This is different from that for pure polypropylene [35] and polyethylene [32] for which the orientation of macromolecules was obvious and remarkable increase of impact strength was seen for these specimens when the fracture propagation direction was perpendicular to the orientation direction. So in this case, any obvious change of the impact strength in PA6/EPDM- g -MA blends should mainly attribute to the contribution of the rubber. As shown in Fig. 2 , for the specimens obtained by conventional injection molding, a sharp brittle\u2013ductile transition occurs at 10\u201320 wt% of rubber content. The toughness becomes independent of rubber content when rubber content is more than 20 wt%. This can be well understood by using Wu's critical matrix-ligament thickness theory. The impact strength of specimens obtained by DPIM is about 30 kJ m \u22122 higher than that of specimens via conventional injection molding at a higher rubber content (more than 15 wt%). Unlike the phenomenon of brittle\u2013ductile\u2013brittle transition observed for dynamic specimens of PP/EPDM blends via DPIM [31] , only brittle to ductile transition is seen for both dynamic and static specimens of PA6/EPDM- g -MA blends. Since the flexural property could also affect the impact strength, particularly when the fracture of IZOD bars is incomplete, the flexural strength and modulus of the samples were measured and the result is listed in Table 2 . For PA6 and its blends, the flexural modulus of dynamic specimens is about 0.1 GPa higher than that of static ones. A similar trend to that of the flexural modulus is again observed for the flexural strength, albeit not significantly. 3.2 Phase morphology The static specimens can be usually divided into two parts called skin layer and core layer. In contrast to the static specimens, the dynamic ones were departed into three parts with a shear layer existing between skin layer and core layer. However, since the skin layer takes only very small part of the specimens and also due to the similarity of phase morphology and crystal structure in this layer between the dynamic and static specimens, we mainly focus our attention on the shear layer and the core and ignore the skin layer in all our discussion. The phase morphology of static specimens in the core layer at T direction and F direction are shown in Fig. 3 . The black domains represent the position of the extracted rubber phase. From these micrographs it is obvious that only sea-island structure exists in the composition investigated. The rubber size is seen not much changed as increasing of rubber content. It is about 0.4\u20130.5 \u03bcm. Combining the phase morphology at these two directions one can conclude that for static specimens the dispersed rubber particles are spherical in the composition investigated. For the phase morphology of dynamic specimens, the shear layer and the core layer were also examined at both T and F direction. The phase morphologies at T direction are shown in Fig. 4 . One observes in this direction always spherical dispersed rubber particles. Again, the rubber size is seen not much changed as increasing of rubber content. But compared with static specimens, the rubber size shows remarkable decrease and drops down to 0.35 in the core and 0.25 \u03bcm in the shear layer, respectively. This can be attributed to the shear induced reaction at the interface between polyamide 6 and EPDM- g -MA during packing process, which provides additional chance for polyamide 6 and EPDM- g -MA to interact at interface. The larger size in the core compared with that in the shear layer may be due to the longer relaxation time in the core, where the specimens are frozen at last. The stretched particles in the shear layer are seen for dynamic specimens at F direction when the rubber content is more than 15 wt%, as shown in Fig. 5 . Due to lower viscosity of the blends while the rubber content below 15 wt%, the dispersed rubber particles keep spherical although the domain size of the dispersed rubber particles is larger than that of blends with rubber content above 15 wt%. When rubber content excesses 15 wt%, besides the sphere, some cigar-like dispersed particles oriented along the shear flow direction are also observed. According to the equation \u03c4 = \u03b7 * \u03b3 , shear stress \u03c4 is proportional to the viscosity. Since the viscosity of the blends increases as increasing of rubber content, a higher shear force is expected for specimens with higher rubber content. So one observes stretched rubber particles at high rubber content. Seen from Fig. 5 one can also find that even at high rubber content the rubber particles remain spherical in the core layer at F direction. This may be attributed either to the elastic recovery and/or the breaking up of the cigar-like particles of the rubbery phase according to the Rayleigh\u2013Taylor\u2013Tomotika theory [22] . The average rubber particle size and particle size polydispersity obtained by image analysis are listed in Table 3 . 3.3 Crystal structure Since polyamide 6 can exist in several polymorphous crystalline phases, one has to ask whether the mentioned increase of impact strength is related to a change of crystal structure induced via shear stress. For this reason, we carried out WAXS experiments for all the composition studied. The WAXD results of selected specimens are shown in Fig. 6 . Peaks at 20.5 and 23.5\u00b0 can be assigned to (200) and the (002) planes of the \u03b1 phase, respectively. The peak around 21.5\u00b0 is characteristic of the \u03b3 phase belong to (200) and (101) planes. Comparing dynamic specimens to static ones, no matter whether the rubber exists or not, one can find that dynamic specimens have more content of \u03b3 phase and less content of \u03b1 phase. However, \u03b1 phase gives higher impact strength than \u03b3 phase [36] . Hence, the improvement of the impact strength of dynamic specimens is not caused by the change of crystalline structure. 3.4 Crystallinity and melting point Since the crystallinity of polyamide 6 will also contribute, at certain degree, to the observed change of impact strength. So we carried out DSC experiment to measure crystallinity of the blends as function of rubber content for both dynamic and static specimens. The melting curves of shear and core layers of dynamic specimens and that of core layer of static ones were shown in Fig. 7 . One expects two melting temperatures, which were for \u03b1 phase and \u03b3 phase, respectively. However, only one melting peak around 220 \u00b0C was seen for each layer of these specimens, which corresponding to the melting of \u03b1 phase. Two possibilities exist: one is that \u03b3 phase had been transferred into \u03b1 phase during heating; the other is that the content of \u03b3 phase is very small and it is melting cannot be detected by DSC. The crystallinity is calculated from the equation: (1) Crystallinity = \u0394 H f \u0394 H f m \u03c7 A \u00d7 100 % where \u0394 H f is the enthalpy of polyamide 6 for the blends, \u0394 H f m is the enthalpy of polyamide 6 whose crystallinity is 100%, the literature value 190 J g \u22121 is used (\u03b1 phase). \u03c7 A is the content of polyamide 6 for the blends. Fig. 8 shows the melting point and crystallinity of the dynamic specimens in different layers and the static specimens in core layer. One observes constant crystallinity and melting point within the whole composition region investigated, which indicating that shear has no effect on these two parameters. So the observed change of impact strength has nothing to do with the change of crystallinity and melting point of polyamide/EPDM- g -MA blends produced by DPIM. 4 Discussion Seen from results above, the crystallinity, melting point and the change of crystalline structures do not contribute to the improvement of impact strength of dynamic specimens. Also, the orientation of polyamide 6 macromolecules does not contribute to the impact strength of the blends. Thus, the difference of the impact strength between dynamic and static specimens should be only attributed to the difference of phase morphology. 4.1 The inter-particle distance For polyamide 66/rubber blends studied by Wu, a simple cubic packing was chosen to approximate the real spatial arrangement of the rubber particles in polyamide matrix, the value \u03c4 of the inter-particle distance can be calculated from the equation [1] : (2) \u03c4 = d [ ( \u03c0 6 V f ) 1 / 3 \u2212 1 ] with the assumption that the dispersed particles are spherical and of equal diameter, d . where V f is volume fraction of these particles. However, in real blends the particle sizes frequently obey a log\u2013normal distribution [37] . The mean inter-particle distance for the blend that is polydisperse system can be described by [38] : (3) \u03c4 = d [ ( \u03c0 6 V f ) 1 / 3 exp ( 1.5 l n 2 \u03c3 ) \u2212 exp ( 0.5 ln 2 \u03c3 ) ] where \u03c3 is particle size distribution. Eq. (3) can be used for static specimens since the rubber particles are roughly spherical in the composition investigated. While for dynamic specimens, the cigar-like rubber particles oriented along the shear flow direction exist in the shear layer, particularly, for specimens with higher rubber content. Can Eq. (3) still be used to calculate the inter-particle distance \u03c4 ? For dynamic specimens all the particles are circular observed at T direction. The values of particle size at this direction are used together with the values of particle size polydispersity to calculate the inter-particle distance. Noting that the particle size in shear layer is smaller than that in core layer, the average particle size of dynamic specimens is represented by number average values considering the area of the cross section of shear layer is two times larger than that of the core layer. Using the parameter listed in Table 3 , the inter-particle distance can be worked out through Eq. (3) . The plot of impact strength versus inter-particle distance is shown in Fig. 9 . A sharp increase of impact strength happens when the inter-particle distance is lower than 0.28 \u03bcm for both dynamic and static specimens, indicating that Wu's theory still works by using the particle size got from T direction, as the fracture propagation direction is perpendicular to the rubber oriented direction. The master curve splits into two in the tough region. For polyamide/rubber blends Wu also found that in the range of \u03c4 < \u03c4 c , the master curve split into separate branches where the level of impact energy depends on the actual composition of blend [1] . However, the split branches studied here cannot be attributed to composition of blends because the impact strength of dynamic specimens is higher than that of static ones under the same rubber content. It can be due to the contribution of the stretched and oriented rubber particles. 4.2 The effect of stretched and oriented rubber particles on impact strength There are two effects of DPIM on phase morphology of PA6/EPDM- g -MA blends, compared to that of conventional one: (1) smaller rubber particle size, (2) the existence of stretched and oriented rubber particles. Many studies have documented that blends with smaller particle size owe higher toughness under the same rubber content. What is the effect of stretched and oriented rubber particles on impact strength? On the one hand, the existence of stretched and oriented rubber particles in dynamic specimens indicates that the flexural stiffness should be higher in these specimens than that of static ones. This is agreed with the experimental results of flexural testing. When IZOD bars are of high toughness, the fracture is incomplete and they bend to let the pendulum swings by during impact process. Under this condition, IZOD bars with higher flexural stiffness would absorb more energy during bending process and thus cause higher impact strength. However, this could not play an important role since the flexural stiffness of dynamic samples is only slight higher than that of static ones. More importantly, the existence of stretched and oriented rubber particles would affect the propagation of cracks during impact process. Fig. 10 shows the SEM micrographs of fractured surface of blends with 20 wt% rubber content. One can view the formation of the striations left behind on the fracture surface parallel to the crack front as a surface layer buckling process occurring during compressive accommodation of the previously stretched crack front material. Muratoglu et al. had studied the parameters affecting the striation spacing and they concluded that the distance between the striations increases with decreasing crack velocity [39] . Observed from Fig. 10 it is clear that the striation spacing of dynamic specimens in shear layer is larger than that of static specimens in core layer which implies the stretched and oriented rubber particles are more efficient in slowing down the crack propagation velocity compared with the spherical ones and thus causes higher impact strength of dynamic specimens. Fig. 11 shows a schematic representation of the failure mechanism. For static specimens with spherical rubber particles, the crack propagates more easily across the section than it does for dynamic specimens with stretched and oriented rubber particles. In this paper, what deserved to pay more attention is the orientation direction of the cigar-like rubber particles is perpendicular to the crack propagation direction since the impact strength has dependence on the angle between the orientation direction of stretched rubber particles and the fracture propagation direction, as studied by Wang et al. [40] . Obviously, the stretched rubber particles will cause a strong concentration of stress at the tip. Since the fracture direction also play roles to determine the impact strength, further fracture experiments are needed on specimens with different orientation with respect to the fracture propagation direction. To do this, a rectangle specimen dimension, instead of dumbbell shape is needed, which allows one to get the impact strength both parallel and perpendicular to the shear flow directions. This work is now undertaking in our group. 5 Conclusion The effect of stretched and oriented rubber particles on impact strength of PA6/EPDM- g -MA blends is demonstrated in this work. The impact strength obtained by DPIM is higher than that obtained via conventional injection molding, especially, for specimens with higher rubber content. The change of crystal structure between dynamic specimens and static ones does not contribute to the improvement of the impact strength. And the crystalline properties keeps almost constant, disregarding rubber content, injection molding mode, in the shear layer or in the core. So the difference of the impact strength between dynamic and static specimens should be mainly attributed to the difference of phase morphology, considering that the identical impact strength of static and dynamic specimen for pure polyamide 6. The SEM micrographs turn out that cigar-like dispersed phase morphology appears via DPIM when the rubber content exceeds 15 wt% and spherical dispersed phase morphology exists in the composition investigated via traditional injection molding. A master curve can be also constructed by plotting the impact strength versus the inter-particle distance, indicating that Wu's criterion still work for blends with stretched and oriented rubber particles. The increased impact strength could be mainly caused by the existence of the stretched and oriented rubber particles in the dynamic samples, which are more efficient in slowing the velocity of crack propagation and thus cause higher impact resistance when the fracture propagation direction is perpendicular to the rubber oriented direction. The slight higher flexural stiffness in dynamic samples may also contribute a small part of the increase of impact strength when the fracture of IZOD bars is incomplete.

        "abstract": "To realize the full potential of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in polymer/CNT nanocomposites, many complicated chemical treatments have been developed to modify the CNTs. Nevertheless, the reinforcing efficiency is still not satisfactory in most cases. In this study, a dramatically improved mechanical enhancement is obtained for polyamide 1010/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT) composites simply by exerting high-rate drawing and incorporating a commercially available compatibilizer. For the fibers prepared at high draw ratio, their tensile strength and modulus are improved by 137 and 132%, respectively, through adding only 0.5 wt% MWNTs. In particular, the increase in strength is at a very high level for the case of non-covalent interaction since CNTs could be stretched to failure according to theoretical calculation. It is demonstrated that this reinforcement is mainly attributed to the compatibilizer inducing good dispersion, and the high-rate drawing inducing strong interfacial interaction and orientation of MWNTs. \u00a9 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.",

In this article, we will report our work on the study of the morphology, crystallization, and mechanical properties of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)/MWNTs nanocomposites prepared by in situ polymerization with very low content of MWNTs (from 0.01 to 0.2 wt %). Well-dispersed MWNTs with a big network throughout PET matrix were observed by SEM. The very small amount of MWNTs displayed a great nucleating effect on the PET crystallization. The crystallization temperature was improved for 6.4\u00b0C by using only 0.01 wt % MWNTs. The decreased chain mobility of PET by adding MWNTs was evident by the formation of imperfect or smaller/thinner crystallites with low melting temperature. An increased storage modulus was also achieved for the nanohybirds with MWNT content less than 0.05 wt %. Our result indicates that using very low content MWNTs (less than 0.1 wt %) is a simple way to achieve good dispersion, yet with remarkable enhancement for polymer/MWNTs modification. \u00a9 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Thermally reduced graphene oxide (TRG) and graphene oxide (GO) were incorporated into the PS. Subsequently, the nanocomposites were foamed with supercritical CO2. The morphology and properties of the nanocomposites and the nucleation efficiency of functionalized graphene in foaming PS are discussed. Compared with GO, TRG exhibited a higher nucleation efficiency and more effective cell expansion inhibition thanks to its larger surface area and better exfoliated structure. It is suggested that the factors that have a significant influence on the nucleation efficiency of TRG and GO originate from the differences in surface properties and chemical structure.

The morphology, crystallization, and mechanical properties of the prepared composites were investigated. It was found that inorganic whiskers could be easily dispersed in PET matrix, as demonstrated by SEM and PLM. DSC and PLM observation indicated a strong nucleation capability of inorganic whiskers for PET. Mechanical analysis results showed that the glass transition temperature, tensile strength, and modulus of the composites were greatly improved. A possible chemical bonding between PET chains and the surface of whiskers was observed by FTIR, TGA, and sedimentation experiment. It could be the main reason for the good dispersion and improved properties of the prepared composites. This work is important for the application of PET due to the low cost but high reinforcing efficiency of this inorganic whisker. \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Although a number of investigations have been devoted to the analysis of silica or carbon black filled elastomer networks, little work has been done on the reinforcement of CaCO3 filled elastomer network. In this work, the reinforcement of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) network by using CaCO 3 nano-particles was investigated. We have found a simultaneous increase of tensile strength, modulus and elongation with the increase in nano-CaCO3 content, which suggests that nano-CaCO3 particles can indeed be used as a reinforcing agent, just like silica or carbon black. Interestingly, the tensile strength, modulus and elongation were seen to leave off for the first time when the content of nano-CaCO3 particles reaches to 80%. PDMS also showed an enhanced elastic modulus and storage modulus with the increase in nano-CaCO3 content, particularly for samples with high nano-CaCO3 content. SEM was used to investigate the dispersion of the filler in PDMS matrix. A better dispersion was found for samples with high nano-CaCO3 content. A great increase of viscosity was found for samples with higher filler content, which is considered to be the reason for the good dispersion thus the reinforcement, because high viscosity will be helpful for breaking the agglomerates of fillers into small size particles under effect of shear. Our work provides a new way for the reinforcement of elastomer by using an adequate amount of nano-CaCO3 particles instead of a small quantity of silica, which is not only economically cheap but also very effective. \u00a92005 World-Scientific.",

        "abstract": "Recently, some attempts have been made to enhance the gas barrier properties of semicrystalline polymers by precisely controlling the arrangement of their impermeable crystalline lamellae. However, it is still a great challenge to achieve regular arrangement of the lamellae along the direction perpendicular to the gas diffusion path, especially using conventional polymer processing technologies. This work presents a novel and simple strategy to dramatically improve oxygen barrier performance of biobased and biodegradable polylactide (PLA) through constructing parallel-aligned shish-kebab-like crystals with well-interlocked boundaries with the aid of a highly active nucleating agent. The nucleating agent was introduced into PLA by melting compounding and the sheet-like specimens were fabricated by compression molding. We demonstrate that the fibrillar nucleating agent dispersed in PLA melt can serve as shish to induce the change of crystallization habit of PLA from isotopic spherulitic crystals to unique shish-kebab-like crystals and the shear flow in the compression molding can induce the highly ordered alignment of the nucleating agent fibrils as well as the subsequent shish-kebab-like crystals along the direction parallel to the sheet surface. More importantly, the growing lamellae are found to interpenetrate and tightly interlock with each other at the boundary regions of the shish-kebab-like crystals in the later stage of the crystallization, forming a densely packed nanobrick wall structure to prevent gas molecules from permeating through the crystals and thus imparting the PLA sheets with unprecedentedly low oxygen permeability. This work provides not only a successful example of preparing semicrystalline polymer with super gas barrier properties by tailoring crystal superstructure but also a promising route to rapidly fabricate high-performance food packaging materials via industrially meaningful melt processing.",

        "abstract": "As a continuation of our previous works on exploring shear-induced epitaxial crystallization of polyolefin blends during practical molding processing [Na et\u00a0al. Polymer 2005; 46, 819 and 5258], the present study focused on the importance of molecular weight on the formation of epitaxial structure in injection-molded bars of high-density polyethylene (HDPE)/isotactic polypropylene (iPP) blends. By choosing two kinds of HDPE and two kinds of iPP with high molecular weight or low molecular weight, four blends with different molecular weight combinations can be designed. After making the blends via melt mixing, the injection-molded bars were prepared in a so-called dynamic packing injection molding equipment where repeated shearing was imposed on the melts during the solidification stage. Crystal structure and orientation were estimated mainly through 2D-WAXD. Our results indicated that an appropriate matching of low molecular weight HDPE and high molecular weight iPP was more favorable for epitaxial crystallization than other component matches. The effects of orientation and epitaxy on the re-crystallization behaviors of polyolefin blends have been elucidated in detail through PLM experiments. Moreover, epitaxy has been proved to play a positive effect in determining the ultimate mechanical properties of injection-molded bars.",

        "title": "The morphology and mechanical properties of dynamic packing injection molded PP/PS blends",
        "abstract": "As a part of long-term project aimed at super polyolefin blends, in this work, we report the mechanical reinforcement and phase morphology of the immiscible blends of polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) achieved by dynamic packing injection molding (DPIM). The shear stress (achieved by DPIM) and interfacial interaction (obtained by using styrene\u2013butadiene\u2013styrene (SBS) as a compatibilizer) have a great effect on phase morphology thus mechanical properties. The shear-induced morphology with core in the center and oriented zone surrounding the core was observed in the cross-section areas of the samples. The phase inversion was also found to shift towards lower PS content under shear stress, at 70 wt% in the core and 30 wt% in the oriented zone, compared with 80 wt% for static samples (without shear). The tensile strength, tensile modules and impact strength were found largely increase by means of either shear stress or compatibilizer. The PS particle size is greatly reduced with adding of SBS, and the reduced particle size results in greater resistance to deformation, which causes the co-continuous structure at oriented zone change into droplet morphology. The morphology resulting from blending and processing was discussed based on effect of interfacial tension, shear rate, phase viscosity ratio and composition. The observed change of mechanical properties was explained based on the combined effect of phase morphology (droplet-matrix or co-continuous phase) and molecular orientation under shear stress. Keywords PP/PS blends Shear Morphology 1 Introduction Polymer blends have been the subject of intense study for a long time, but in the recent years, totally immiscible blends are interesting for many polymer researchers. The typical example for immiscible polymer blends is blend of polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS). PP and PS are two of the most widely used plastics in the world. In this system, one is crystalline phase and the other is amorphous phase. Because the entropy contribution to the Gibbs energy of melt blending is negligible, the immiscible blends from a thermodynamic point of view have some interesting morphology and mechanical properties. For PP/PS blends, many researches were focused on the morphology and mechanical properties [1\u20137] . Zhimin Xie and others [7] used the Mori\u2013Tanaka model and the Halpin\u2013Tsai model to investigate the moduli and tensile strength of PP/PS blends. They anticipated that there existed a certain minimum volumes fraction \u03d1 min of dispersed phase. When the volume fraction is less than \u03d1 min , the ultimate strength will be controlled by matrix deformation, and when the volume fraction of dispersed phase exceeds the minimum value, the ultimate strength will be controlled by the dispersed phase deformation. They also found that PP/PS blend would have a stationary mechanical property in the phase inversion region. Mitsuyoshi Fujiyama [8] blended PP with 0\u201330 wt% of three kinds of PS with different melt flow indexes, and found that the degrees of crystallinity and crystalline c -axis orientation decreased with PS blending. PS particles were seen the smallest when the ratio of the viscosity of PS to that of PP at molding shear rate was slightly lower that unity. The phase inversion is quite common phenomenon for immiscible polymer blends. The morphology was found to be dependent on the blend composition and the viscosity ration of the constituent components [9\u201314] . Sung-Goo Lee [10] reported that when the melt viscosity of PS was higher than that of PP, there was a phase inversion at the PS composition of around 75 wt% in PP/PS blends. Because of the poor interfacial interactions between the immiscible blends from a thermodynamic point of view, many researches focused on the improvement of interfacial interactions. The main method is the use of a suitable modifier that can increase the adhesion and decrease the interfacial tension between the immiscible blends [15\u201320] . Appleby T. [21] used a commercial triblock co-polymer (Kraton G1652 (SEBS)) as a compatibilizer for PP/PS blends. Their results showed that addition of SEBS greatly improves the impact strength of the blends. D. Hlavata [22\u201327] and co-workers studied the compatibilizing effect of several co-polymers with styrene and butadiene blocks on PP/PS blends. They found a certain amount of a compatibilizer is localized at the interface between PP and PS. The use of compatibilizer can improve the mechanical properties. Radonjic G. [28] studied the compatibilization of PP/PS with styrene\u2013butadiene\u2013styrene (SBS) and reported that when the content of PP and PS are equal, the co-continuous morphology was observed. The adding of SBS can reduce the diameter of the PS dispersed particles as well as improve the interfacial adhesion between PP and PS phases. They also revealed that SBS was not only located at the interface between PP and PS phases but also formed, together with the pure PS dispersed particles. Generally, there are three major factors that govern the morphology of immiscible polymer blends. They are: (1) the rheological and interfacial properties of the constituent components (such as, shear viscosity and fluid elasticity, interfacial tension); (2) blend composition; and (3) processing variables (such as temperature, shear rate). In the past, a lot of work has been done on how these three factors determine blend morphology. It is well established that the blend morphology can be grouped roughly into: (1) co-continuous morphology and (2) dispersed morphology. However, it is not clear whether the co-continuous morphology is stable, giving rise to an equilibrium morphology, or an intermediate step that eventually leads to dispersed morphology, and how the external shear stress can affect the final morphology and mechanical properties. In recent years, dynamic packing injection molding (DPIM) has been found a very important way to control polymer morphology and mechanical properties [29\u201331] . The main feature of this technology is that the specimen is forced to move repeatedly in the model by two pistons that move reversibly with the same frequency during cooling, which results in preferential orientation of dispersed phase as well as the matrix. We have performed extensive experimental work on the controlling of phase morphology of polyolefin blends, such as PP/LLDPE [32] , PP/HDPE [33] , PP/EPDM [34,35] , HDPE/EVA [36] and PP/clay nanocomposites [37] , by using DPIM technique. The super polyolefin blends with high modulus and tensile strength as well as high impact strength has been obtained [32,33,36] . By controlling the EPDM particles as elongated and oriented in PP matrix, a brittle\u2013ductile\u2013brittle transition of impact strength was found for the first as increasing of EPDM content [34,35] . In this work, we extended DPIM technology into PP/PS and PP/PS/SBS blends. Our proposes are two-folds, one is to better understand the morphological development of immiscible polymer blends during external shear stress, and the other is to achieve high performance PP/PS blends by controlling of the orientation, phase separation and crystal morphology. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials The PP, PS and SBS used in the experiment are commercial products, PP (2401, melt flow index is 2.5 g/10 min) and PS (666D, melt flow index is 4.3 g/10 min) were purchased from the Yan Shan Petroleum Chemical, China; SBS (F675, M n =1.8\u00d710 5 , and the styrene content is about 40%) was purchased from the Mao Ming Petroleum Chemical, China. 2.2 Samples preparation Various blends were prepared by varying the PS content from 0 to 100% (wt%). Melt blending of a pair of polymers was conducted using twin-screw extruder (TSSJ-25 co-rotating twin-screw extruder). After making droplets, the blends were molded by DPIM technology. The schematic representation of this technology is shown in Fig. 1 , and the specimen is shown in Fig. 2 . The detailed experiment procedure was described in Refs. [32,33] . The DPIM technology relies on the application of shear stress fields to melt/solid interfaces during the packing stage by means of hydraulically actuated pistons. The main feature is that after the melt is injected into the mold the specimen is forced to move repeatedly in a chamber by two pistons that move reversibly with the same frequency as the solidification progressively occurs from the mold wall to the molding core part. The processing parameters are listed in Table 1 . We also prepared the \u2018static\u2019 specimens by using the conventional molding technology for comparison purpose. The specimen obtained by DPIM is called dynamic sample, and the specimen obtained by static packing injection molding is called static sample. 2.3 Mechanical properties measurement RG T-10 Universal Testing Machine was used to measure the stress\u2013strain curves, moving speed was 50 mm/min. the measure temperature was 20 \u00b0C. For impact strength measurement, the central part of sample (40 mm long) was used. A notch with 45\u00b0 was made by machine and remained width is 5.0 mm. The experiment was carried out on an I200XJU-2.75 Impact tester according to ISO 179. The values of all the mechanical parameters are calculated as averages over 6\u20139 specimens for each composition. 2.4 SEM experiment The morphologies of the blends were studied by preferential etching of the PS phase in butanone for 2.5 h. The samples were fractured in liquid nitrogen prior to etching. Then the phase morphology was observed in an SEM instrument, JSM-5900LV, operating at 20 KV. 3 Results 3.1 PP/PS blends 3.1.1 Mechanical properties Let's begin with the mechanical properties of PP/PS system first. Fig. 3a shows the typical stress\u2013strain curves of static samples of PP/PS blends. One observes a sharp decrease of elongation at break from 20% of PP to 5% of the blends when adding PS to the PP matrix. This is most likely due to the fact that PP and PS are completely immiscible. Not only the elongation, but also the yield stress (tensile strength) decrease as increasing of PS content up to 80 wt%, where a minimum is seen. Then the tensile strength increases again with further increasing of PS content. This result is in a good agreement with that obtained by Xie [7] . For dynamic samples, on the other hand, the decreasing of elongation is more gradually compared with that of pure PP ( Fig. 3b ). In fact, one even see a slight increase of elongation when 10 wt% of PS is added to PP. In this case, not only the phase morphology, but also the orientation of the components plays an important role to determine the final elongation. As a summary, the tensile strength of samples as function of PS content is shown in Fig. 4 . The values are calculated as averages over 6\u20139 specimens for each composition, and the data for both static and dynamic samples is plotted in one figure for comparison. Two important features should be noted in Fig. 4 : (1) the tensile strength of dynamic samples is higher than that of static samples in the whole composition region, due to the molecular orientation induced by shear stress in DPIM. And (2) the minimum occurs at 80 wt% PS content for static samples, but shifts to 70 wt% PS content for dynamic samples, which indicating the phase morphology may be changed under the shear stress. It should be noted that the tensile strength also depends on the direction of measurements, further tensile experiments are needed on samples with different orientation with respect to the tensile direction. This work is undertaking in our group. The Izod Notched impact strength of the samples was also carried out with the fracture loading perpendicular to the shear flow direction. This is shown in Fig. 5 . For static samples, one observes a very low impact strength (4\u20135 KJ/m 2 ) for pure PP, and the impact strength keeps constant up to 50% PS content, and down to 1.5 KJ/m 2 at 90 wt% of PS content. For dynamic samples, a very high impact strength (21 KJ/m 2 ) is seen for pure PP. This is caused by two factors (1) the molecular orientation of PP induced by shear stress and (2) the fracture loading is perpendicular to the shear flow direction. The impact strength of dynamic samples decreases sharply from 21 to 12 KJ/m 2 at 10 wt%, 10 KJ/m 2 at 30 wt%, 6 KJ/m 2 at 50%, and down to 2.5 KJ/m 2 at 90 wt% PS content, respectively. Actually, the difference of the impact strength between static and dynamic samples is very little at PS content larger than 50 wt%. This result suggests that, the effect of orientation of PP on impact strength becomes less important as increasing of PS content, and the phase morphology plays a dominating role to determine the impact strength. 3.1.2 Phase morphology Due to the fast cooling of the melt at the surface of mold, usually the skin and core-like structure is seen on the cross-section area for static samples. The dispersed phase in the core has a bigger size than that in the skin layer, due to the temperature difference in the samples. The core has a higher temperature thus a longer time for phase separation. Fig. 6 is the change of morphology of static samples at central part (the core) as a function of composition. The black domains indicate the position of the extracted PS phase. One observes a sea-island structure in the composition to 50 wt% PS content, which indicates that PS forms a dispersed phase and PP forms a continuous phase in these composition region. The shape of PS dispersed phase is spherical and the size of PS increases from 0.2 to 0.4 to 1\u20131.5 \u03bcm when PS content increases from 10 to 50 wt%. There is a big increase of PS domain size (like a co-continuous structure) at 70 wt% PS content. A clear cut co-continuous morphology is seen at 80 wt% PS content, where the minimum tensile strength is observed in Fig. 4 . In contrast to the static samples, macroscopically the shear-induced morphology of dynamic samples can be divided into three parts instead of two parts. They are the core in the center and oriented zone surrounding the core and the skin layer, as in the case of other polyolefin blends achieved by DPIM. To be compared with Fig. 6 , Fig. 7 shows the morphological change as a function of PS content at the center for the dynamic samples. Not very much difference is seen up to 50 wt% PS content, in terms of the particle shape and size. However, one indeed observes a big change of phase morphology with samples at 70 and 80 wt% PS content. Now the co-continuous structure occurs obviously at 70 wt% PS content ( Fig. 7d ), where the minimum tensile strength is seen in Fig. 4 . PP is found to forms a dispersed phase instead of continuous phase at 80 wt% PS content, as shown in Fig. 7e . To further verify the shear induced morphological change, the phase morphology at the oriented zone, where the effect of shear stress can be most demonstrated, was examined. This is shown in Fig. 8 . It can be seen that the morphology is apparent different from the static samples and from the center part of dynamic samples. PS particles are no longer spherical but elongated and deformed seriously. With the increase of PS content, the deformed particles become bigger and coarser. The co-continuous structure is seen even at 30 wt% of PS content ( Fig. 8b ). 3.2 PP/PS/SBS blends Not only the composition, but also the interfacial tension plays a role to determine the phase morphology for the immiscible blends. A suitable compatibilizer is often used for improving interfacial adhesion between the components. SBS is frequently selected as the compatibilizer for PP/PS blends [27] . In our work, we also choose SBS as the compatiblizer to investigate the change of mechanical properties as well as morphology under the effect of shear stress. Fig. 9 shows the typical stress\u2013strain curves of PP/PS (70/30) blends as function of SBS content. An increase of elongation is seen for both static and dynamic samples as increasing of SBS content, combined with a decrease of tensile strength. The tensile strength of PP/PS blends with different SBS content is shown in Fig. 10 . Fig. 10a shows the result for static samples and Fig. 9b is the tensile strength of dynamic samples. As PS content is low (say less than 30 wt%) the tensile strength decrease as adding of SBS as compatiblizer both for static samples and dynamic samples. In this case, SBS acts as rather a softening-material than as a compatiblizer. The tensile strength is found to increase as increasing of SBS content when PS content is larger than 30 wt% for static samples, or when PS content is larger than 50 wt% for dynamic samples. In this case, the enhancement of interfacial interaction plays a dominating role to determine the tensile strength. However, the reduced difference among the dynamic samples with different SBS contents seems to suggest that the shear stress will reduce, to certain extent, the effect of SBS on the interface thus tensile strength ( Fig. 10b ). Actually, shear induced phase separation at low shear rate has been reported [38] . Fig. 11 shows the impact strength with the adding of SBS for both static and dynamic samples. The enhancement of impact strength is observed for all the composition. The trend is more or less the same for both static and dynamic samples. The increasing of impact strength is understood as due to the improvement of interaction between PP and PS when SBS serves as a compatiblizer. The phase morphologies of PP/PS (70/30) blends with different SBS content are shown in Fig. 12 (center part of static samples) and Fig. 13 (oriented zone of dynamic samples). It is obvious that the size of dispersed PS particles is reduced with adding of the SBS co-polymer both for static and dynamic samples. However, the increasing of SBS content, from 2 to 10 wt%, does not help very much for the further decreasing of the particle size. Not only the decreasing of PS particle size, but also the co-continuous structure ( Fig. 13a ) at oriented zone is changed into droplet morphology ( Fig. 13b\u2013d ) with adding of SBS for dynamic samples. At this moment, only the morphology of compatibilized PP/PS (70/30) blends was studied, to show, as an example, the morphological change of the blends before and after DPIM. The interesting concentration region should also cover PS content from 30 to 80 wt%, where the difference between the two preparation methods is remarkable. 4 Discussions 4.1 Region of phase inversion The phase inversion is a common phenomenon in immiscible polymer blends. Jordhamo et al. [39] developed an empirical model based on the melt-viscosity ratio, \u03b7 d / \u03b7 m , and the volume fraction \u03c6 , of each phase for predicting the phase inversion region in immiscible polymer blends. Phase inversion should take place as the following criterion holds: (1) \u03b7 1 \u03b7 2 \u03c6 2 \u03c6 1 =1 Jordhamo's model however, is limited to low shear rates and does not take into account the effect of variations in the interfacial tension between the phases. For the PP/PS blends studied here, both the shear stress and interfacial tension should be considered to explain the observed region of phase inversion. Since the viscosity ratio during processing conditions is not available at moment, one cannot predict the region of phase inversion. For static samples, it should be around 80 wt% PS content from the SEM result ( Fig. 6 ) and correspondingly, one sees the minimum of the tensile strength at 80 wt% PS content ( Fig. 4a ). For dynamic samples, however, the phase inversion is found to shift 70 wt% PS content at the center part, and a co-continuous phase is observed. This is shown in Fig. 7 , which indicating that the region of co-continuity shift towards lower PS content under shear stress field. Correspondingly, the minimum of tensile strength at 70 wt% content is seen ( Fig. 4b ). At high shear rate zone (oriented zone), the co-continuous structure is seen even at 30 wt% of PS content ( Fig. 8b ). The effect of shear stress on the region of phase inversion is schematically shown in Fig. 14 . Without shear stress, generally speaking, the PS dispersed phase forms spherical in the core layer (center part). However, under shear stress, the PS phase is elongated in sheet-like or ellipsoidal form in the flow direction, and the degree of elongation is different in oriented zone and in the core. At oriented zone, the elongation is strong and becomes weaker in the core. As shown in Fig. 14 , phase inversion is expected to occur at lower PS content (30 wt%) in the oriented zone, and at higher PS content (70%) in the core. 4.2 The morphology of polymer blends vs. processing It is well known that the morphology of polymer blends depends mainly upon the rheological and interfacial properties, the blending conditions, and the volume ratio of the components. The size and the deformation of a purely viscous (Newtonian) droplet surrounded by another Newtonian fluid is determined mainly by two parameters [40,41] : (a) the viscosity ratio ( \u03bb ): (2) \u03bb= \u03b7 d \u03b7 m In the equation, the \u03b7 d is the viscosity of dispersed phase and the \u03b7 m is the viscosity of matrix. (b) the k -term of the form (3) k= \u03c3 \u03b7 m \u00b7 \u03b3 \u0307 R where \u03c3 is interfacial tension, \u03b3 is shear rate, and R is droplet radius. The physical meaning of the k -term is a balance between the resistance to deformation of the droplet ( \u03c3 / R ) and the local acting shear stress ( \u03b7 m \u00b7 \u03b3 ) which deforms the droplet. For the polymers of viscoelastic rather than viscous nature, \u03c3 in the k -term has to be corrected by a factor that considers the effect of the normal forces arising from the elasticity of the phases [42] . So by choosing the viscosity ratio, controlling the interfacial tension (for example, via using compatiblizer) and shear rate, the phase morphology of polymer blends can be well controlled. For an injection molded PP/PS blends, the phase morphology is quite complicated. An anisotropy distribution of PS size and shape is evident. As mentioned before, the skin and core-like structure is seen on the cross-section area for static samples, and the morphology of core in the center and oriented zone surrounding the core and the skin layer is observed for dynamic samples. Even more complicated, as discussed above, for dynamic samples, the co-continuous phase is seen at 30% PS content at oriented zone but 70% PS content at the core. The effect of interfacial tension on the phase morphology is demonstrated in Figs. 12 and 13 . The reduced particle size with adding SBS is understood as resulting from the reduced interfacial tension. According to the Eq. (3) , the smaller the droplets, the greater is the resistance to deformation. On the other hand, the greater the shear stress, the easier is the deformation. So under the combined effect of shear stress and SBS compatiblizer, not only the decreasing of PS particle size, but also the co-continuous structure ( Fig. 13a ) at oriented zone is changed into droplet morphology ( Fig. 13b\u2013d ). 4.3 Tensile modulus Compared with tensile strength and impact strength, the tensile modulus is frequently used for theoretical prediction. Tensile moduli of polymer blends are strongly dependent on the composition and morphology. In the case of a droplet-matrix morphology the tensile modulus will be largely determined by the modulus of the matrix phase. A relatively high and isotropic value of tensile modulus is expected for co-continuous blends due to their interpenetrating phase structure [43] . It was reported that the modulus of a fibrous blend can be largely determined by modulus of the dispersed (fibrous) phase, especially in oriented samples [44,45] . Theoretically, several models can be found which describe tensile moduli of blends as a function of the composition [46\u201350] . The moduli of polymer blends generally range between an upper bound, E u , given by the parallel model [46] : (4) E u =\u03a6 1 E 1 +\u03a6 2 E 2 And a lower bound, E L , given by the series model [47] (5) 1 E u = \u03a6 1 E 1 + \u03a6 2 E 2 In which E i and \u03c6 i are the modulus and volume fraction of phase i . It should be noted that the parallel and series models are only valid for simple and idealized structure. For an injection molded PP/PS blends, especially for dynamic samples, the phase morphology is quite complicated, thus complicated moduli are expected. Fig. 15 shows the tensile modulus of PP/PS blends as a function of composition both for static and dynamic samples. For static samples, a synergetic effect is seen up to 20% of PS content, where the blends shows a higher tensile modulus than that of pure PP from additivity of the modulus via parallel model, due partly to the small phase separation (see Fig. 6a ). This result is in somewhat agreement with that reported by Guptaand Purwar [51] . However, beyond 20 up to 100 wt% of PS content, the tensile modulus follows the law described by the series model because of the large phase separation in the blends ( Fig. 6b\u2013e ). An increasing of tensile modulus does not happen when a change of phase morphology from droplet-matrix to co-continuous phase takes place at 80% PS content, as in the case of PE/PS and PE/PP blends as reported by Willemse et al. [42] . For dynamic samples, the orientation of the components plays an important role to determine the tensile modulus, additional to the morphology and composition. Comparing the difference of tensile modulus between dynamic and static samples of pure PP and PS, one observes a big enhancement for PP but a small enhancement for PS through DPIM. This result indicates that PP molecules are much easier to be oriented along the shear flow direction than PS molecules due to the relatively linear structure of PP molecules compared with PS molecules. As increasing of PS content, a decreasing of tensile modulus is seen and a minimum is reached around 50% PS content. Then tensile modulus increases up to 100 wt% PS content. It should be also noted that the tensile modulus is less than that predicted by the series model in the whole composition region. A number of factors can be considered to explain the observed decreasing of tensile modulus as increasing of PS content for dynamic samples. It may be due to (1) increasing of phase separation, (2) decreasing of the orientation of PP, this holds especially for composition regions from 30 to 70% PS content, where the co-continuous phase forms either in the oriented zone or the core. Because of the interpenetrating phase networks in co-continuous phase, the molecular orientation will be highly hindered even under shear stress. The combined effect of phase separation and less oriented molecules causes the minimum of tensile modulus occurs around 50 wt% PS content. Since the tensile modulus is closely related to the molecular orientation, further experiments are needed on samples with different orientation with respect to the tensile direction. This work is undertaking in our group. 5 Conclusion The shear stress and interfacial tension play an important role to determine the phase morphology thus mechanical properties of PP/PS blends. A complicated morphology with core in the center and oriented zone surrounding the core forms in the cross-section areas of dynamic samples. The phase inversion was also found to occur around 80 wt% PS content for static samples, and shifts towards lower PS content under effect of shear stress, at 70 wt% in the core and 30 wt% in the oriented zone for dynamic samples. The PS particle size is greatly reduced with adding of SBS, and the reduced particle size results in greater resistance to deformation, which causes the co-continuous structure at oriented zone change into droplet morphology. The increasing of phase separation and the decreasing of molecular orientation of PP as increasing of PS content can explain the change of tensile strength and tensile modulus as a function of PS content.

        "abstract": "As a part of long-term project aimed at super polyolefin blends, in this work, we report the mechanical reinforcement and phase morphology of the blends of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) achieved by dynamic packing injection molding. The shear stress (achieved by dynamic packing injection molding) and interfacial interaction (obtained by using EVA with different VA content) have a great effect on phase morphology and thus mechanical properties. The super HDPE/EVA blends having high modulus (1.9\u20132.2 GPa), high tensile strength (100\u2013120 MPa) and high impact strength (six times as that of pure HDPE) have been prepared by controlling the phase separation, molecular orientation and crystal morphology of the blends. The phase inversion was also found to shift towards lower EVA content under shear stress. The enhancement of tensile strength and modulus originates from the formation of oriented layer, while the high impact strength is related to shear induced phase morphology. DSC studies indicated that the shish kebab crystal structure that also contributes to the enhancement of tensile strength is formed in the oriented layer. The dramatic improvement of impact strength may result from the formation of microfibers and elongated EVA particles along the flow direction. Wu's toughening theory was found non-applicable for the elongated and oriented rubber particles, and a brittle\u2013ductile\u2013brittle transition was observed with increasing EVA content.

The main feature of this technology is that the specimen is forced to move repeatedly in the model by two pistons that move reversibly with the same frequency during cooling, which results in preferential orientation of the dispersed phase as well as the matrix. The typical morphology of samples obtained via DPIM is a shear-induced morphology with a core in the center, an oriented zone surrounding the core and a skin layer in the cross-section areas. Shear-induced phase dissolution at a higher shear rate but phase separation at low shear rates is evident from AFM examination of LLDPE/PP (50/50) blends. The super polyolefin blends having high modulus (1.9-2.2 GPa), high tensile strength (100-120 MPa) and high impact strength (6 times as that of pure HDPE) have been prepared by controlling the phase separation, molecular orientation and crystal morphology.",

The specimens were injection-molded by using different melt temperatures to acquire different microphase structures. As a result of temperature-dependent segregation driving force, the specimens with reduced microphase separation can be obtained by increasing processing melt temperature from 180 \u00b0C to 240 \u00b0C. On the basis of stress-strain behavior, Young's modulus was found to increase with increasing PS domain continuity in the order of disorder state to disordered spheres to body-cubic-centered (BCC) spheres to oriented cylinders morphology. Meanwhile, cyclic hysteresis decreases with reduced microphase separation and with decreasing the applied predetermined maximum tensile strain.

        "abstract": "In our previous work, a hybrid shish kebab structure, with polyethylene (PE) crystal lamellae periodically decorated on the surface of an inorganic whisker (SMCW) and aligned approximately perpendicular to the long axis of the whisker, has been observed in the injection molded bar of PE/SMCW composites. To investigate the effect of the molecular weight of the PE matrix on the formation of the hybrid shish kebab structure and the corresponding physical properties of HDPE/SMCW composites, in this work, three types of PE with different molecular weights were used to prepare the composites. They were first melt blended and then subjected to dynamic packing injection molding (DPIM), in which the prolonged shear was exerted on the melt during the solidification stage. An obvious hybrid shish kebab (HSK) structure, with PE crystal lamellae closely packed on the surface of the SMCW, was found in the samples with a low molecular weight PE (LMW-PE) matrix and a medium molecular weight PE (MMW-PE) matrix. However, in samples with a high molecular weight PE (HMW-PE) matrix, an incomplete HSK structure with PE crystal lamellae loosely decorated on the surface of the SMCW was observed. Furthermore, DSC results indicated that SMCW served as a good nucleating agent only for the composite with a LMW-PE matrix and the nucleation efficiency decreased with increasing PE molecular weight. Correspondingly, the tensile strength of the PE/SMCW composites was significantly improved by adding SMCW for the samples with a LMW-PE or MMW-PE matrix. Especially for samples with a LMW-PE matrix, the tensile strength was remarkably enhanced by the presence of only 1 wt % SMCW. For the composites with a HMW-PE matrix, the addition of SMCW had almost no reinforcing effect on the composites. The molecular weight dependence of the formation of HSK and property enhancement was discussed on the basis of the chain mobility and crystallization capability of the PE matrix.",

        "abstract": "Ultrasonication is often used to disperse nano-particles in aqueous solution. However, a good dispersion of nano-particles in aqueous solution is not always achieved, due to the fact that incoming ultrasonicwaves in liquid are usually reflected and damped at the gas/liquid interface. In this work, we report a so-called wet-grinding assisted ultrasonication (GU) method, in which wet-grinding of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in chitosan solution is carried out before ultrasonication. The dispersions of MWCNTs were characterized by visual comparison, UV/vis spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results demonstrate that the dispersion quality of chitosan/MWCNT suspension prepared by wet-grinding assisted ultrasonication is much better than that by ultrasonication or wet-grinding alone. It was found that wet-grinding could improve the water wettability of MWCNTs and eliminate the barrier of air layer around MWCNTs to ultrasonicwaves. Meanwhile, the composite from the chitosan/MWCNTs suspension prepared by GU method has an obvious improvement in mechanical property compared to pure chitosan. This simple method for integrating MWCNTs and biocompatible chitosan into a homogeneous dispersion may have great potential application in biotechnology, such as preparing composite materials for medicine, bio-fiber, biosensor, antibacterial coating, and cell cultivation.",

Wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) results are in agreement with differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) melting curves; both demonstrate the formation of the hexagonal \u03b2 phase after adding \u03b2 nucleating agent in PP/POE blends. The addition of \u03b2 nucleating agent increases the toughness of PP and PP/POE blends but decreases their tensile strength. Brittle-ductile transition (BDT) occurs in PP/POE blends, but no obvious BDT point can be seen in \u03b2 nucleated PP/POE blends. The toughening mechanism, morphology of the fractured surfaces after impact, was investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM). From impact strength interparticle distance curves, a critical interparticle distance of -0-2 \u03bcm is seen in PP/POE blends, but no critical value is observed for \u03b2 nucleated system, indicating better interaction between PP and POE, deduced by their good compatibility. The toughening and softening effect of \u03b2 nucleating agent is also responsible. \u00a9 2007 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.",

        "abstract": "In this Article, the morphological evolution in the blend thin film of polystyrene (PS)/poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) was investigated via mainly AFM. It was found that an enriched two-layer structure with PS at the upper layer and PCL at the bottom layer was formed during spinning coating. By changing the solution concentration, different kinds of crystal morphologies, such as finger-like, dendritic, and spherulitic-like, could be obtained at the bottom PCL layer. These different initial states led to the morphological evolution processes to be quite different from each other, so the phase separation, dewetting, and crystalline morphology of PS/PCL blend films as a function of time were studied. It was interesting to find that the morphological evolution of PS at the upper layer was largely dependent on the film thickness. For the ultrathin (15 nm) blend film, a liquid-solid/liquid-liquid dewetting-wetting process was observed, forming ribbons that rupture into discrete circular PS islands on voronoi finger-like PCL crystal. For the thick (30 nm) blend film, the liquid-liquid dewetting of the upper PS layer from the underlying adsorbed PCL layer was found, forming interconnected rim structures that rupture into discrete circular PS islands embedded in the single lamellar PCL dendritic crystal due to Rayleigh instability. For the thicker (60 nm) blend film, a two-step liquid-liquid dewetting process with regular holes decorated with dendritic PCL crystal at early annealing stage and small holes decorated with spherulite-like PCL crystal among the early dewetting holes at later annealing stage was observed. The mechanism of this unusual morphological evolution process was discussed on the basis of the entropy effect and annealing-induced phase separation.",

        "abstract": "Polymer/filler composites have been widely used in various areas. One of the keys to achieve the high performance of these composites is good interfacial interaction between polymer matrix and filler. As a relatively new approach, the possibility to enhance polymer/filler interfacial interaction via crystallization of polymer on the surface of fillers, i.e., interfacial crystallization, is summarized and discussed in this paper. Interfacial crystallization has attracted tremendous interest in the past several decades, and some unique hybrid crystalline structures have been observed, including hybrid shish-kebab and hybrid shish-calabash structures in which the filler served as the shish and crystalline polymer as the kebab/calabash. Thus, the manipulation of the interfacial crystallization architecture offers a potential highly effective route to achieve strong polymer/filler interaction. This review is based on the latest development of interfacial crystallization in polymer/filler composites and will be organized as follows. The structural/morphological features of various interfacial crystallization fashions are described first. Subsequently, various influences on the final structure/morphology of hybrid crystallization and the nucleation and/or growth mechanisms of crystallization behaviors at polymer/filler interface are reviewed. Then recent studies on interfacial crystallization induced interfacial enhancement ascertained by different research methodologies are addressed, including a comparative analysis to highlight the positive role of interfacial crystallization on the resultant mechanical reinforcement. Finally, a conclusion, including future perspectives, is presented. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the structural orientation and tensile properties were investigated on the extrusion-elongated sheets of polypropylene (PP)/multi-walled carbon nanotubes' (MWCNTs) composites. The MWCNTs were modified via reactive grafting with octadecylamine to enhance the capability of dispersion in PP matrix. The orientation level of composite sheets was adjusted through adopting various drawn speeds after extrusion, and the structure-property relation was inspected systematically through the combination of two-dimensional wide-angle X-ray scattering, polarized light microscopy and tensile mechanical testing. The tensile behavior of the extrusion-drawn sheet was significantly impacted by both adding MWCNTs and increase of drawn speed. An optimization for simultaneously strengthening and toughening was achieved in the sample with relatively high content MWCNTs prepared upon fast drawn speed. Incorporation of nanotubes didn't alter the orientation degree of crystalline lamellae obviously, but the oriented nanotubes could act as the nucleating templates for the growth of oriented crystalline superstructure. Combined with the present morphological characterizations and the results in other published papers, it was postulated that the oriented superstructure of cylindrulites composed of rigid CNTs as nucleus and PP lamellae as kebabs might be generated in the extrusion-elongated sheets of PP/MWCNTs, which was regarded as the morphological reason for a reinforcing effect on tensile performances. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "As a part of long-term project aimed at super polyolefin blends, in this work, we report the toughness and phase morphology of polypropylene (PP)/EPDM/SiO 2 ternary composites. Two processing methods were employed to prepare PP/elastomer/filler ternary composites. One was called one-step processing method, in which the elastomer and the filler directly melt blended with PP matrix. Another one was called two-step processing method, in which the elastomer and the filler were mixed first, and then melt blended with pure PP. Two kinds of PP (grafted without or with maleic anhydride (PP- g -MA)) and SiO 2 (treated with or without coupling agent) were used to control the interfacial interaction among the components. The dependence of the phase morphology on interfacial interaction and processing method was investigated. It was found that the formation of filler-network structure could be a key for a simultaneous enhancement of toughness and modulus of PP and its formation seemed to be dependent on the work of adhesion ( W AB ) and processing method. As the W AB of PP/EPDM interface was much lower than that of PP/SiO 2 and EPDM/SiO 2 , and the two-step processing method was used, the formation of filler-network structure was favorable. In this case, a super toughened PP ternary composite with the Izod impact strength 2\u20133 times higher than PP/EPDM binary blend and 15\u201320 times higher than pure PP could be achieved.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, to investigate the effects of interactions between poly(quaternary ammonium) salts (PQAs) and poly(ethylene glycol) on their mixed micellar surface structures and properties under spontaneous conditions, a series of PQAs were first designed and synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) using 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) quaternized by bromobutane, bromooctane, and bromododecane, respectively. Poly(poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (PPEG) with a similar degree of polymerization was also prepared using poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate by ATRP. Next, these PQAs were mixed with an equal weight of PPEG in water to cross-assemble into mixed micelles. The structures and features of these mixed micelles were characterized by fluorescence measurements, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), phase analysis light scattering (PALS), proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR), and hydrogen-hydrogen correlation spectroscopy nuclear magnetic resonance (H-H COSY NMR). These results suggest that PQAs and PPEG mixtures can cross-assemble into mixed micelles with low CMC. The surface structures, particle sizes, size distributions, and zeta potentials of PQAs and PPEG mixtures can be tailored by varying the alkyl chain length in quaternary ammonium salts, and the alkyl chain length also influences the distribution and the alkyl chain orientation of quaternary ammonium salts on mixed micelle surfaces. In addition, cytotoxicity of these mixed micelles can be markedly reduced by PPEG compared with their corresponding PQAs, but their good antibacterial activities are still maintained to a certain degree, as evaluated by methyl tetrazolium assay (MTT) and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Our present work provides a new avenue for the preparation of biocompatible and antibacterial materials for biomedical applications.",

        "abstract": "Novel cationic biodegradable multiblock poly(epsilon-caprolactone urethane)s that contain gemini quaternary ammonium side groups on the hard segments were developed. To obtain these polyurethanes, a new L-lysine-derivatized diamine containing gemini quaternary ammonium side groups (GA8) was first synthesized and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS), and high-resolution mass spectra (HRMS). Then a series of gemini poly(epsilon-caprolactone urethane)s were designed and prepared using L-lysine ethyl ester diisocyanate (LDI), poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) diols, 1,4-butandiol (BDO), and GA8 and were terminated by methoxyl-poly(ethylene glycol) (m-PEG). The obtained polyurethanes were fully characterized by (1)H NMR, gel permeation chromatograph (GPC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), FTIR, and water contact angle (WCA) measurement. The gemini polyurethane shows a rapid rate of hydrolytic and enzymatic degradation, as demonstrated by weight loss and polarizing light microscopy (PLM) observations. In vitro cytotoxicity analysis suggests that both the polyurethanes and their degradation products do not show significant inhibition effect against fibroblasts. Our work provides a new way to synthesize nontoxic and amphiphilic multiblock polyurethanes with rapid degradation rate, and these new materials could be good candidates as biodegradable carriers for drug and gene delivery.",

Depending on incorporated component, interfacial adhesion and processing conditions, various oriented structure and morphology could be obtained. First, we will elucidate the epitaxial behavior between PP and high-density polyethylene occurring in practical molded processing.

        "abstract": "In this article, the rheological properties of polypropylene (PP)/ethylene\u2013propylene\u2013diene terpolymer (EPDM)/silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) ternary composites were systematically investigated. Two kinds of nano-SiO 2 particles (with hydrophobic (denoted as A-SiO 2 ) or hydrophilic (denoted as B-SiO 2 )) as well as two processing methods (one-step or two-step) were first employed to prepare PP/EPDM/SiO 2 ternary composites. Then the deep mixing and morphology evolution of polymer composite with mixing time were assessed by rheological method, on the focus of formation of filler-network, and compared with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations. Linear viscoelastic behavior was observed for PP/EPDM and PP/SiO 2 binary system, showing no evidence of the formation of filler-network structure. However, a solid-like rheological behavior, which was attributed to the formation of the filler-network structure as confirmed by SEM observation, could be observed in some PP/EPDM/SiO 2 ternary systems, depending on the SiO 2 surface property, processing method and EPDM content. It seemed that SiO 2 with hydrophilic surface was necessary for the formation of filler-network in PP/EPDM/SiO 2 ternary system. Besides, two-step processing method made the solid-like behavior occurred at an earlier stage compared with that of a one-step processing method, also, the higher elastomer content facilitated the formation of the filler-network structure. The results were in good agreement with those reported in our previous publications [Yang H, Zhang Q, Guo M, Wang C, Du R, Fu Q.

In this work, a core-shell structured hybrid (SiO(2)-GO) was prepared and introduced into an epoxy polymer matrix as a new filler. The incorporation of the hybrid optimized the modulus, strength and fracture toughness of the composites simultaneously. The ultrathin GO shells coated on silica surfaces were regarded as the main reason for the enhancement. Located at the silica-epoxy interface, GO served as an unconventional coupling agent of the silica filler, which effectively enhanced the interfacial interaction of the epoxy/SiO(2)-GO composites, and thus greatly improved the mechanical properties of the epoxy resin. We believe this new and effective approach that using GO as a novel fillers surface modifier may open a novel interface design strategy for developing high performance composites.",

Meanwhile, the high elongation at break of PPC was maintained. This overall property reinforcement could not be observed by adding either PLA or CNTs separately. At room temperature, the obtained mechanical properties of the reinforced PPC are comparable to or even better than those of some traditional petroleum-based polymers such as low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene and polypropylene (PP). Together with good biodegradability and excellent conductivity, the PPC/PLA/CNT composites prepared in this work exhibit a potential to be used as a sustainable alternative to petroleum-based polymers such as PP around room temperature. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, EPDM rubber and nano-SiO2 particles were employed to modify PP simultaneously. Our goal was to control the distribution and dispersion of EPDM and nano-SiO2 particles in PP matrix by using an appropriate processing method and adjusting the wettability of nano-SiO 2 particles toward PP and EPDM, so as to achieve a simultaneous enhancement of toughness and modulus of PP. With regard to this, two kinds of nano-SiO2 particles (with hydrophilic or hydrophobic) as well as two processing methods (one-step or two-step) were employed to prepare PP/EPDM/SiO2 ternary composites. A unique structure with the majority of EPDM particles surrounded by SiO2 particles was first observed by using hydrophilic SiO2 and two-step processing method, resulting in a dramatically increase of Izod impact strength as the rubber content in the range of brittle-ductile transition (15-20 wt%). The observation that poor adhesion and poor compatibility between particles and PP matrix could result in a significant increase in Izod impact strength was unusual and needed further investigation. This could be tentatively understood as a consequence of the overlap of the 'stress volume' between EPDM and SiO2 particles due to the formation of the unique structure. Our work provided a deep understanding of the toughening mechanism and a new way for the preparation of high performance polymer composites. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Low density polyethylene (LDPE)/lignin blends were prepared using melt blending. Two kinds of compatibilizers, ethylene-vinylacetate (EVA) which is softer than LDPE and polyethylene grafted with maleic anhydride (PE-g-MA) which is harder than LDPE were used to improve the interfacial adhesion. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to investigate the dispersion of lignin in LDPE matrix. The results showed that both of the compatibilizers could improve the interaction between the low density polyethylene and lignin. However, the effects of the two compatibilizers on the mechanical properties of LDPE/lignin blends were different. The elongation at break of the blends was obviously increased by adding EVA, while significant improvement of tensile strength was observed by adding PE-g-MA. Several theoretical models have been used to further analyze the experimental data, combined with the morphological observation of tensile fractured surfaces by SEM. \u00a9 2009 World Scientific Publishing Company.",

By adjusting the processing method, an inversed phase, where the minor component PA66 forms the continue phase and the major component PPS forms the dispersed phase, is observed for the first time. This is explained as due to the locking effects of clay layers on the phase development. The result is interesting and also very important, which provides a new way to control the phase morphology and phase inversion in immiscible polymer blends by using clay.",

The structure and morphology of PVDF hollow fiber were examined by BET adsorption, dry/wet weight method and scanning\n electron microscopy (SEM). It is found that the increase in PVP content and extrusion rate of spinning solution can result\n in the increase of water flux and decrease of solute rejection. The improvements of interconnected porous structure and pore\n size are induced by shear-thinning behavior of spinning solution at high extrusion rates, which could result in the increase\n of water flux of hollow fiber membranes. The increase of extrusion rate also leads to the increase of membrane thickness due\n to the recovery effect of elastic property of polymer chains.",

In this work, whiskers, with a large length/diameter ratio and with a diameter (0.2-2 \u03bcm) much larger than that of carbon nanotubes but much smaller than that of common fibers, were used to nucleate crystal morphology in polypropylene (PP)/whisker composites. The crystal morphology, interfacial adhesion and tensile properties of the composites were carefully investigated. A kind of peculiar shish-calabash crystallization morphology, with whisker serves as shish and PP spherulites serves as calabash, was observed for the first time in the thin film via PLM and in the injection molded bars by SEM. The formation mechanism of this shish-calabash structure was attributed to be that only a few nuclei could be induced on the whisker surface, which develop into large PP spherulites without hindrance, and finally stringed by the whisker, forming the shish-calabash structure. As a result, a significant improvement of interfacial interaction and tensile properties has been achieved. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "In this work, the chitosan ternary nanocomposites with two-dimensional (2D) clay platelets and one-dimensional (1D) CNTs have been successfully prepared by a simple solution-intercalation/mixing method in acid media. It was found that the thermal degradation temperature of chitosan (at 50% weight loss) could be only improved in about 20\u201330 \u00b0C by adding 3 wt% either clay or CNTs, however, almost 80 \u00b0C increase of degradation temperature could be achieved by adding 2 wt% clay and 1 wt% CNTs together. Dynamic mechanical measurement demonstrated an obviously improved storage modulus for chitosan/clay\u2013CNTs than that for the corresponding binary chitosan/clay or chitosan/CNT nanocomposites with the same total filler content (3 wt%). For the solvent vapor permeation properties, a largely improved benzene vapor barrier property was observed only in chitosan/clay\u2013CNT ternary nanocomposites and depended on the ratio of clay to CNTs. XRD, SEM and TEM results showed that both clay and CNTs could be well dispersed in the ternary nanocomposites with the nanotubes located around the clay platelets. FTIR showed an improved interaction between the fillers and chitosan by using both clay and CNTs. A much enhanced solid-like behavior was observed in the ternary nanocomposites, compared with the corresponding binary nanocomposites with the same total filler content, as indicated by rheological measurement. The unique synergistic effect of two-dimensional (2D) clay platelets and one-dimensional (1D) CNTs on the property enhancement could be tentatively understood as due to a formation of much jammed filler network with 1D CNTs and 2D clay platelets combined together. Our work demonstrates a good example for the preparation of high performance polymer nanocomposites by using nanofillers with different dimensions together. Keywords Chitosan Clay Carbon nanotube Nanocomposite 1 Introduction In recent years, much attention has been paid to natural polymers due to the energy crisis and environmental problem [1\u20133] . Chitosan, poly-\u03b2(1,4)-2-amino-2-deoxy- d -glucose, is the deacetylated products of chitin, the second abundant natural polymer on earth [4] . Chitosan has been widely studied for biosensors, tissue engineering, separation membrane, and water treatment and so on, because of its good biocompatibility, biodegradability, and multiple functional groups [5] . However, low mechanical properties, thermal stability, and barrier of chitosan restrict its use in a wide-range application. Nanocomposite technology using nanofillers such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), clay, and silica has already proved to be an effective way to improve the mechanical, electrical, and\u00a0thermal properties of polymers [6\u20139] . Carbon nanotubes as one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials are used for a variety of applications, because of their unique mechanical, electrical, thermal properties as well as large aspect ratio [10\u201314] . For example, with incorporation of only 0.8% CNTs into chitosan, the mechanical properties were greatly improved [15] . On the other hand, nanoclay as a two-dimensional (2D) material is also widely used in the preparation of polymer nanocomposites. Chitosan/clay composites were described in some literatures [16\u201319] . Because of the polycationic nature of the chitosan in acid media, this biopolymer can intercalate into the pristine clay by means of cationic exchange process in the absence of other organic modifiers. Intercalated and exfoliated nanostructures are formed in this system, which can provide strong interactions between the clay and chitosan. The enhanced thermal stability properties of chitosan were reported [18] , however, the extent of enhancement was not ideal, especially in the range of 200\u2013400 \u00b0C. The study on filler network with different dimensions of nanofillers together in polymer is rarely reported. In recent years, an improved flame retardation of polymer was reported by adding carbon nanotube and clay simultaneously [20\u201323] . The thermal and flame retardant properties of the related ethylene\u2013vinyl acetate (EVA) matrices were significantly enhanced when organo-modified clays and carbon nanotubes were added simultaneously [23] . Zhang et\u00a0al. have successfully grown carbon nanotubes on clay platelet to form 3D nanostructure filler [24] . The tensile modulus and the tensile strength of the nylon-6 composite were greatly improved, by about 290% and 150%, respectively, by the incorporation of only 1 wt% CNT\u2013clay hybrid filler due to the synergistic effect of CNTs and clay platelets for their homogeneous dispersion and strong interaction with the polymer matrix. However, fabrication of clay\u2013CNT hybrid filler needs special conditions and high cost, and some new methods need to be explored. In this work, in order to investigate the synergistic effect of combination of 2D clay platelets and 1D CNTs on the properties of chitosan, the chitosan/clay\u2013CNT ternary nanocomposites with fixed total filler content but changed ratio of clay to CNTs have been successfully prepared by a simple solution-intercalation/mixing method in acid media. It is crucial to have uniform filler dispersion within the polymer matrix and good interfacial adhesion between nanofillers and polymer matrix for making high performance nanocomposite. In one hand, the acidified CNTs attached to hydrophilic groups such as \u2013COOH and \u2013OH can be well dispersed in chitosan solution due to the hydrogen bond between chitosan and CNTs [15] . On the other hand, chitosan, a hydrophilic biopolymer, has \u2013NH 2 and \u2013OH in each unit. The amino group in chitosan can be protonated to NH 3 + in acid media, which is in favor of the intercalation of polymer chain into clay by means of a cationic exchange process [19] . Thus, a good dispersion of both clay and CNTs in chitosan solution is expected. The thermal stability, dynamic mechanical and solvent vapor transport properties of chitosan/CNT\u2013clay nanocomposites were investigated, and a significant synergistic effect has been observed. The synergistic effect of 2D clay platelets and 1D CNTs was ascribed to (1) good dispersion of both clay and CNTs in chitosan matrix, as indicated by TEM, SEM and WAXD; (2) enhanced interaction between fillers and chitosan, as indicated by FTIR; and (3) enhanced fillers network by addition of both clay and CNTs, as indicated by rheological measurement. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials Chitosan powder, with a deacetylation degree of 86% and a viscosity\u2013average molecular weight of 345\u2008000 g/mol, was bought from Zhejiang Golden-Shell Biochemical Co. Ltd. (Yuhuan, China). The unmodified pristine clay (Na + \u2013montmorillonite), with a cationic exchange capacity (CEC) of 96 mequiv/100 g, was purchased from Southern Clay Products, Inc., TX. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs, purity > 95%, diameter 10\u201330 nm, length 5\u201315 \u03bcm), manufactured by CVD, were purchased from Shenzhen Nanotech Port Co. (China). Benzene, glacial acetic acid, sulfuric acid (98%), and nitric acid (65%) were purchased from Kelong Chemical Reagent Plant (Chengdu, China). The raw MWNTs were treated in a mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid (98%)/nitric acid (3:1) at 30 \u00b0C for 24 h to increase the amounts of carboxylic and hydroxyl groups [25] . All reagents were of analytical grade. Distilled water was used throughout. 2.2 Preparation of the nanocomposite membranes A chitosan solution of 2% (w/v) was prepared by dissolving chitosan (CS) in a 2% (v/v) aqueous acetic acid solution followed by filtration to remove the impurity. The clay was first swelled in 40 mL of distilled water and ultrasonicated for 15 min by using ultrasonication tip (CF-300, 29 kHz, 150 W, Southwest Applied Acoustics Institute, Sichuan, China). Then, the clay suspension was added into the chitosan solution with clay content ranging from 1 to 3 wt% (with respect to chitosan), followed by stirring at 60 \u00b0C for 5 h. Subsequently, desired amount of CNT suspension was added into the mixture solution in various contents (1, 2 and 3 wt%). The stirring rate was kept at a speed of 400 rpm for 1 h. The resulting chitosan concentration in mixture solution was controlled to 2% (w/v) by evaporating water. The solutions were degassed for overnight under vacuum. After that, chitosan/clay/CNT solutions were poured into a glass plate and dried at 50 \u00b0C for 12 h to remove the solvents. The dried membranes were soaked in 2 wt% aqueous NaOH for 1 h to remove the acid and washed with water to neutrality and then dried at 50 \u00b0C for 5 h. The obtained membranes were peeled from the glass plate and stored at room temperature in a desiccator (RH = 50%). Mean thickness of the membranes was 50 \u03bcm. The samples were termed as chitosan/ x clay/ y CNTs (where x and y represent the weight contents of clay and CNTs, respectively). 2.3 Measurements and characterizations 2.3.1 Fourier transform infrared spectra Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were measured on a Nicolet560 spectrophotometer to investigate the interaction between chitosan and nanofillers in the range of 4000\u2013400 cm \u22121 under a transmittance mode. The membrane samples were cut into some fragments, and these fragments were ground into powder. Then, the powder sample was mixed with KBr, and the resulting mixture was pressed into disks (about 0.3 mm in thickness) for FTIR test. 2.3.2 Wide-angle X-ray diffraction The structure of nanocomposites, especially, the state of intercalation of the clay was characterized by wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). X-ray experiment was performed using X' Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 0.15418 nm) under a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA. Samples were scanned over the range of diffraction angle 2 \u03b8 = 1\u201330\u00b0 with a scan speed of 3\u00b0/min at room temperature. To measure the relative crystallinity ( X c ) of membrane, the amorphous areas and crystalline peak areas were measured, and X c was calculated from diffracted intensity data (2 \u03b8 = 6\u201330\u00b0) with the following relationship [21] : X c = [ A c / ( A c + A a ) ] \u00d7 100 % where A c and A a represent the areas of the crystalline and amorphous regions, respectively. 2.3.3 Thermogravimetric analysis The thermal stability of membranes was measured by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, WRT-2P Shanghai Scale Factory). TGA was performed under nitrogen flows from 50 to 800 \u00b0C at a heating rate of 20 \u00b0C/min. The weights of the samples varied from 5 to 8 mg. To study the effect of nanofiller on formation of carbonaceous layer during heating, the char residues at 600 \u00b0C under nitrogen flows (after TGA test) were collected for scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation. 2.3.4 Electron microscopic observations The dispersion of nanofillers in matrix was observed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The fractured surface and char residues of the chitosan/clay/CNTs nanocomposites were observed by via SEM (JSM-5900LV) under an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. Before being examined, the membrane samples were cryogenically fractured in liquid nitrogen and coated with gold. Ultrathin sections with thicknesses of 50\u201370 nm for TEM observation were prepared via cutting from the epoxy block with embedded nanocomposite membranes at room temperature using a diamond knife. The TEM images were taken with transmission electron microscopy (JEM-2010) under an accelerated voltage of 200 kV. 2.3.5 Rheological measurements Oscillatory shear measurements were performed on a controlled stress RH7D rheometer (Bohlin Instruments Ltd) using 40-mm diameter cone and plate with a cone angle of 4\u00b0. Frequency sweep with an angular velocity between 0.01 and 100 rad/s was performed in the linear viscoelastic regime at a low stress of 3. The gap between the cone and the plate is 0.15 mm during measurement. The sample was allowed to equilibrate for at least 5 min at 25 \u00b0C before oscillatory shear measurements. 2.3.6 Water vapor permeability Water vapor permeability (WVP) of membranes was evaluated by a gravimetric test according to ATSM E96 and was performed at 30 \u00b0C. The detailed WVP measurement method can be found elsewhere [26] . Fifteen millilitres of water was introduced in each cup. The membranes were fixed on top of the cup and effective contact area was 2.53 cm 2 . The cups containing water were weighted, and then were place in an oven (RH = 30%, T = 30 \u00b0C). The weight of the cups was recorded every 2 h for a total of 24 h. Linear regression was used to calculate the slope of this line ( r 2 \u2265 0.996). Benzene vapor permeability of membranes was also determined by the method above. Three parallel measurements were carried out for each sample to obtain mean value. 2.3.7 Dynamic mechanical analysis Dynamic mechanical properties of the prepared composites (storage modulus, loss modulus and tan \u03b4 ) were characterized using a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA, Q800, TA Company) using tension membrane clamps, from 40 to 240 \u00b0C at a frequency of 1 Hz and a heating rate of 3 \u00b0C/min. The membrane was cut into the strip of 30 \u00d7 5 mm for DMA test. 3 Results 3.1 XRD analysis and electron microscopic images Fig.\u00a01 shows the XRD patterns of pure clay (sodium montmorillonite), neat chitosan, chitosan/clay, chitosan/CNTs, and chitosan/CNT\u2013clay composites with total filler content of 3 wt%. The basal spacing ( d 001 ) of pure clay has been calculated to be 1.2 nm from a diffraction peak at 2 \u03b8 = 7.2\u00b0 using Bragg function. The characteristic peak of the clay disappears in the XRD spectrum for chitosan/CNT\u2013clay composite when the clay content is less than 3 wt%, which means the formation of exfoliated structure of clay. The diffraction peak of chitosan/clay (3 wt%) is shifted to a lower angle (2 \u03b8 = 2.5\u00b0), showing an intercalated structure with the d -spacing of about 3.5 nm. This indicates that the layered clay is delaminated in the chitosan solution as the clay content is relatively low, whereas the intercalated structure is dominant when clay content becomes higher. It is noted that the diffraction peak in chitosan/clay composite is markedly sharpened compared to that in pure clay, indicating the enhanced ordered structure of clay in composite. Similar results were reported in other polymer/clay composites [40,41] . It could be explained as following reasons: (1) the distribution of interlayer spacing of clay become narrow after intercalation; (2) clay platelets can regularly arrange along a certain direction in chitosan membrane, compared to clay powder. Some researches also demonstrated that clay could easily orient parallel to the surface of solution-casting film [42,43] . The neat chitosan shows weak crystalline peaks around 2 \u03b8 = 11.3\u00b0, 18.2\u00b0, 23\u00b0 in the XRD spectrum. The broadened peak around 2 \u03b8 = 23\u00b0 indicates the existence of an amorphous structure. The crystalline peaks around 2 \u03b8 = 11.3\u00b0, 18.2\u00b0, 23\u00b0 become somewhat stronger and sharper, accompanying a new peak at about 8.5\u00b0, after incorporating CNTs or clay into chitosan. The result suggests a higher crystallinity or denser packing in the main chain in comparison with the neat chitosan. This result is consistent with other reports in the literatures [15,18] . To see directly the dispersion of clay and CNTs in chitosan matrix, the TEM image of chitosan nanocomposite with 2 wt% clay and 1 wt% CNTs is shown in Fig.\u00a02 . Fig.\u00a02 a shows an exfoliated structure of clay platelets, which are randomly distributed in chitosan matrix, and meanwhile carbon nanotubes are observed to be well dispersed in chitosan. On the basis of the XRD results and TEM image, it can be concluded that the chitosan/CNT\u2013clay nanocomposites with an exfoliated or intercalated structure of clay and well-dispersed CNTs have been successfully prepared through the simple solution-intercalation/mixing method. In Fig.\u00a02 b (high magnification TEM image of Fig.\u00a02 a), a part of CNTs indicated by white arrows is seen to be located around the clay platelets and form a kind of clay\u2013CNT network, which could result in strong interaction between chitosan chains and the fillers. This result will be discussed in FTIR spectrum. Fig.\u00a03 shows typical scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of fracture surface for (a) chitosan/2% clay/1% CNTs and (b) chitosan/1% clay/2% CNTs after brittle fracture in liquid nitrogen. The well-dispersed bright dots and lines are the end of CNTs and clay platelets. Fig.\u00a03 a shows once again that CNTs and clay platelets can be well dispersed in chitosan matrix for chitosan/2% clay/1% CNTs composite, while some aggregates (remarked by black circle) are observed for chitosan/1% clay/2% CNT composite, as shown in Fig.\u00a03 b. It is interesting to see here that the ratio of clay to CNTs also plays a role to determine the dispersion of fillers in the matrix. 3.2 Thermal stability The TGA curves of chitosan and its nanocomposite with various components under nitrogen flows are shown in Fig.\u00a04 . In TGA, three parameters were measured: the temperature of thermal degradation at 20% weight loss, the temperature at 50% weight loss, and the yield of charred residue under nitrogen flow. One observes two steps of non-oxidative degradation. Firstly, the weight loss between 50 and 200 \u00b0C is attributed to the water absorbed in chitosan. Secondly, the weight loss in the temperature range of 200\u2013400 \u00b0C corresponds to the degradation and deacetylation of chitosan. This is accorded with some literatures [17,18] . The summary of TGA result is listed in Table 1 . As degradation temperature at 50% loss weight is concerned, the thermal degradation temperature of chitosan is improved by about 20\u201330 \u00b0C after adding 3 wt% either clay or CNTs, however, almost 80 \u00b0C increase of degradation temperature has been achieved by adding 2 wt% clay and 1 wt% CNTs together, resulting in an increase of degradation temperature from 365 \u00b0C for pure chitosan to 442 \u00b0C for chitosan/2% clay/1% CNTs composite. The highest char residues (40.2% at 750 \u00b0C) are observed for this ternary nanocomposite. These results indicate a significantly synergistic effect of combination of 2D clay platelets and 1D CNTs on the thermal properties of chitosan. The large improvement of thermal stability of chitosan may rise from three reasons: (1) good heat barrier properties of CNTs and clay for polymer matrix during formation of chars [18] ; (2) formation of carbonaceous layer on the polymer surface at lower temperature [22] , which could hinder the flux of degradation product and heat flowing into underlying materials; (3) much jammed and conjugated 3D clay\u2013CNT network, or strong interaction between chitosan and nanofillers could also restrict the polymer motion during heating (see below the FTIR and rheology results). It is interesting to see that the ratio of clay to CNTs also plays a role to determine the thermal stability. Chitosan/2% clay/1% CNT composites have the best thermal stability, and only mild increase of degradation temperature is seen for chitosan/1% clay/2% CNTs. 3.3 Dynamic mechanical properties The synergistic effect of combination of 2D clay platelets and 1D CNTs on the properties of chitosan can be further demonstrated by the measurement of dynamic mechanical properties. The storage modulus and tan \u03b4 of the chitosan and its composites with total filler content (3 wt%) but changed ratio of clay to CNTs, as a function of temperature, are shown in Fig.\u00a05 . One observes an increase of storage modulus of chitosan by adding either 3 wt% clay or 3 wt% CNTs, as expected. However, the obvious increase of storage modulus is seen only for the ternary composites containing both clay and CNTs, in all the temperature range investigated. The storage modulus at 40 \u00b0C was improved by 56% from 3771 MPa for neat chitosan to 5899 MPa for chitosan/2% clay/1% CNT composites. The increase in storage modulus suggests that the interactions between chitosan matrix and CNTs or clay are strong enough to allow a very efficient load transfer to fillers, providing high mechanical strengths. Again the highest storage modulus is observed for chitosan/2% clay/1% CNT composites. On the other hand, one observes two peaks for all the samples. The one is located at around 90\u2013100 \u00b0C, which is due to the evaporation of water absorbed. Some studies showed that the glass transition of chitosan was higher than 170 \u00b0C [27\u201329] ; hence, the peak located at around 180 \u00b0C could be considered as the glass transition temperature of chitosan. Although greatly increased storage modulus of chitosan is observed by adding clay or CNTs, the presence of CNTs, or clay, even both of them, does not significantly affect the peak position. Similar effects have been reported in other polymer systems filled with finely divided materials [6,30,31] . 3.4 The solvent vapor permeation properties The solvent vapor permeation properties were investigated in the work to show more evidences of synergistic effect of combination of 2D clay platelets and 1D CNTs on the properties of chitosan, the results are listed in Table 2 . Clays are considered as a good candidate for improving the barrier properties by creating a tortuous path for the molecule diffusion [32,33] , however, in the case of chitosan binary or ternary nanocomposites, the extent of barrier improvement for water vapor is not as obvious as expected by adding clay into chitosan matrix as it occurs in other polymers [34] . This result could be directly associated with the increased hydrophilic nature of chitosan due to the introduction of polar group from clay or acidified CNTs. The absorbed water molecules weaken the inter-molecular interactions of chitosan driving to dissolve more water and increasing the water diffusion rate, which lead to largely losing the barrier ability of clay in polymer [34] . In contrast to water vapor permeability, chitosan and its nanocomposites have a good barrier property for benzene vapor, as shown in Table 2 . With increasing of clay content in chitosan, benzene vapor permeation rate is obviously decreased from 18.8 g/m 2 d for neat chitosan to 7.45 g/m 2 d for chitosan/3% clay composite. It maybe attributed to an effect obstacle for benzene vapor diffusion due to the formation of clay network in chitosan and the enhanced crystallinity of polymer. Some literatures have reported that open-ended carbon nanotube could be used to increase the gas permeability in polymer by unique gas transport in nanochannel of carbon nanotube [35,36] , but not much change of permeability in chitosan/CNT composites is observed in our work, probably due to the increased crystallinity of chitosan by adding CNTs. Compared with neat chitosan and the binary composites, the largest improvement of barrier property of benzene vapor is observed in chitosan/2% clay/1% CNT composite, the benzene vapor permeation is further decreased to 4.2 g/m 2 d (see Table 2 ). Again the ratio of clay to CNTs also plays a role to determine the barrier property, for chitosan/1% clay/2% CNT composite, the benzene vapor permeation of 7.84 g/m 2 d is observed. It should be noted that the ratio of the water vapor permeation to benzene vapor permeation for the neat chitosan is changed from 81.7 to 330.7 for chitosan/2% clay/1% CNT composite. This much increased difference of membrane permeability between water vapor and benzene vapor could be well applied in pervaporation dehydration of benzene/water mixture. 3.5 FTIR analysis To understand the origin of the observed synergistic effect on the properties of chitosan by adding both 2D clay platelets and 1D CNTs, FTIR experiment was carried out and the result is shown in Fig.\u00a06 . The FTIR spectrum of acidified CNTs shows two peaks at 3448 cm \u22121 , 1723 cm \u22121 , corresponding to OH and C O stretching, respectively. Clay platelets show \u2013OH ( \u03bd \u2013OH \u223c 3632, 3447 cm \u22121 ) and Si\u2013O\u2013Si groups ( \u03bd Si\u2013O\u2013Si \u223c 1050 cm \u22121 ), which could act as hydrogen-bonding sites for functional groups of chitosan. The strong bands at 1656 and 1599 cm \u22121 are ascribed to the amide I (C O stretching) and amide II (N\u2013H blending modes) absorbance, respectively [18] . The effects of hydrogen bonding were taken into account for the intercalation of chitosan chain into negatively charged clay [37] . The amide band for chitosan with 3 wt% clay is shifted toward low frequency values as shown in Fig.\u00a06 d, indicating a possible formation of hydrogen bonding between clay and chitosan. Fig.\u00a06 e shows that the amide I ( \u03bd C O \u223c 1656 cm \u22121 ) and amide II ( \u03b4 \u2013NH2 \u223c 1599 cm \u22121 ) for chitosan/2% clay/1% CNTs are further shifted to lower frequency ( \u03bd C O \u223c 1633 cm \u22121 and \u03b4 \u2013NH2 \u223c 1599 cm \u22121 ). Meanwhile, \u2013OH group band at 3455 cm \u22121 in chitosan is also shifted toward low frequency. This result indicates an enhanced hydrogen-bonding interaction between chitosan and the fillers by using both clay and CNTs. In some reports [37,38] , the intensity and location of Si\u2013O\u2013Si absorbance band are used to discuss the structure and morphology of clay in polymer matrix. Unfortunately, the change of Si\u2013O\u2013Si absorbance band is not observed in our case, due to the overlap of Si\u2013O\u2013Si absorbance band with C\u2013O\u2013C band of chitosan. 3.6 Rheological measurement Rheological measurement is a powerful tool for the investigating of interaction in a filled composite. The storage modulus G \u2032 under small-amplitude oscillatory shear in solution with 5% of chitosan or its composites is shown in Fig.\u00a07 (we failed to carry out the rheological measurement on chitosan melt due to its easy degradation). In the high \u03c9 regime corresponding to the chain motion within small timescale, not much difference of the G \u2032 is seen for chitosan/clay, chitosan/CNT and chitosan/clay\u2013CNT nanocomposites, which suggest that the movement of partial polymer chains, such as segment and amino group attached to the backbone, is not greatly influenced by nanofillers. However, the G \u2032 in the low \u03c9 regime is significantly different among the composites. The G \u2032 of chitosan/CNTs or chitosan/clay nanocomposite (the content of CNTs is 3 wt%) is slightly higher than that of basal polymer. One observes a very narrow plateau at low frequency regime for chitosan/clay composites. The frequency independence of G \u2032 at low frequency regime is regarded as a pseudo-solid-like behavior, and indicating a formation of percolating filler network. Within such locally correlated filler network, the relaxation of the chains upon the applied low-amplitude strain is incomplete at long time range, suggesting that the free movement of chains is restricted by the spatially confined geometry constituted by the anisotropic clay tactoids and nanoplatelets [39] . It is interesting to note a much enhanced G \u2032 and even broader plateau for chitosan/clay\u2013CNT nanocomposites (with 2 wt% of clay and 1 wt% of CNTs), with respect to the chitosan nanocomposite with 3 wt% clay or CNTs. This very strong pseudo-solid-like behavior suggests a much higher degree of restricted relaxation behavior. 4 Discussion Combined with the FTIR and rheological measurement results, the unique synergistic effect of two-dimensional (2D) clay platelets and one-dimensional (1D) CNTs on the property enhancement could be tentatively understood as due to a formation of much jammed filler network by adding both 1D CNTs and 2D clay platelets. The possible mechanism of the 2D clay platelet network enhanced by adding 1D CNTs is schematically shown in Fig.\u00a08 . In the chitosan with 3 wt% of clay, it is possible to form 2D clay platelet network, as indicated by rheological measurement ( Fig.\u00a08 a). In chitosan/clay\u2013CNT ternary nanocomposites, the 1D CNTs are located around 2D clay platelet network, or the 1D CNTs are confined in the 2D clay platelet network, resulting in a much jammed and conjugated 3D clay\u2013CNT network ( Fig.\u00a08 b). This proposed jammed and conjugated 3D clay\u2013CNT network could be well used to explain the observed synergistic effect, such as the enhanced thermal stability and barrier property of benzene vapor. The surface morphology of the char of chitosan nanocomposites is shown in Fig.\u00a09 . For the chitosan/3% CNT composite, some microcrack and large holes are observed in the char layer, which indicates the high weight loss of degradation product. The degradation temperature of chitosan/clay is higher than that of chitosan/CNTs and the former corresponds to the relatively dense and small pore structure in char. When clay and CNTs are added together into chitosan, the char is denser and has fewer cracks, as shown in Fig.\u00a09 c. These results further support the existence of much stronger interaction between chitosan and nanofillers in the chitosan/clay\u2013CNT composite. This much jammed and conjugated 3D clay\u2013CNT network assists in formation of more compact carbonaceous layer on the polymer surface at lower temperature [18] , which could hinder the flux of degradation product and heat flowing into underlying materials. But, only mild increase of degradation temperature is seen for chitosan/1% clay/2% CNTs, which is probably associated with the dispersion of CNTs and incomplete filler network (with respect to chitosan/2% clay/1% CNTs). As shown in Fig.\u00a03 b, the dispersion of CNTs in chitosan/1% clay/2% CNTs is relatively poor, which is a disadvantage for CNTs to bridge with clay platelets and form homogeneous carbonaceous layer for protecting the polymer from thermal degradation during formation of chars. As the barrier property is concerned, chitosan/2% clay/1% CNT composite has almost the same crystallinity with that in chitosan/3% clay and chitosan/1% clay/2% CNTs, as shown in the XRD pattern and Table 2 . But its barrier property is much better than the latter two, indicating a larger tortuosity in chitosan/2% clay/1% CNTs. Additions of CNTs or clay improve greatly the crystallinity of chitosan, which is an important factor for enhancement of barrier property of chitosan. Obviously here the crystallinity plays less important role in the further increase of the barrier properties for chitosan/clay\u2013CNT ternary nanocomposites compared to chitosan/clay nanocomposites. Again, the more jammed and intact filler network formed in chitosan/2% clay/1% CNT composite will create a more effective path with larger tortuosity for diffusion of benzene vapor. Thus 3D filler network combined with 2D clay and 1D CNTs could be the key factor for the enhancement of barrier properties in this situation. More work is needed to further prove that using nanofillers with different dimensions could result in a much jammed and intact filler network. 5 Conclusion In summary, the chitosan/clay\u2013CNT ternary nanocomposites with good thermal stability, storage modulus and barrier properties of benzene vapor have been successfully prepared by a simple solution-intercalation/mixing method in acid media. A great synergistic effect of 2D clay platelets and 1D CNTs (chitosan/2% clay/1% CNTs) for improving thermal stability, dynamic mechanical and barrier properties of chitosan matrix has been observed. This could be understood as due to a formation of 3D conjugated filler network with 1D CNTs inserted in the 2D clay platelet network, of which unique nanostructure provides larger tortuosity and obstacle for the transport of heat and benzene vapor. In this work, only a part of CNTs located in clay platelets network is observed as shown in TEM images, but we believe that larger extent of 1D CNTs inserted in the 2D clay platelet network will result in a larger improvement of chitosan property. Our work demonstrates a good example for the preparation of high performance polymer nanocomposites by using nanofillers of different dimensions together. These properties improved for chitosan will enlarge its application field, such as medicine material, plastic substitutes and pervaporation dehydration.

Furthermore, MWCNTs/fluoro-elastomer (FE) composite films were prepared by the method of solution casting using untreated MWCNTs (UCNTs), acid-modified MWCNTs (ACNTs) and CF4 plasma-modified MWCNTs (FCNTs). In each case, MWCNTs mass fractions were 0.1%, 0.5%, 1.0% and 2.0% with respect to the polymer. The conductivity of MWCNTs/FE was studied by comparing the modification effect on MWCNTs.

In this work, two types of CNTs with the same diameter range and different topography structure, namely multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) with a relatively smooth surface and double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs) bundles with a groove structure, were used to induce polyethylene (PE) crystallization for the formation of NHSK. For PE/MWNTs system, NHSK was formed only at a relatively low crystallization temperature (T c), and PE lamellae are not completely perpendicular to the long axis of MWNTs. However, for PE/DWNTs bundles system, NHSK could be obtained even at a much higher T c, and almost all the PE lamellae are perpendicular to CNTs long axis, due to the unique \"groove structure\" formed by DWNTs bundles. The enhanced nucleation ability and the facilitated lamellae orientation by using DWNTs bundles are not only of great crystallography interest but also are very important for functional design in nanodevice applications. \u00a9 Materials Research Society 2012.",

        "abstract": "Obtaining network-like morphology (rubber particles are unevenly distributed in the matrix, forming a discontinuous rubber network structure) has been considered to be an effective strategy to optimize the toughness of rubber-toughened polymers. However, it is very difficult to achieve using conventional processing method. In this work, taking elastomer-toughened polylactide (PLA) as an example, we attempt to use hydrophilic silica (SiO 2) nanoparticles with self-networking capability to control the phase morphology and the mechanical properties of PLA/poly(ether)urethane (PU) (85/15) blend. It is interesting to find that the selective localization of SiO2 nanoparticles in the PU phase and at the phase interface induces the morphological change from a common sea-island structure to a unique network-like structure constructed by discrete PU particles with irregular shapes, thus giving rise to a remarkable improvement in the impact toughness of the blend with strength and modulus unaffected. The formation of the network-like structure is attributed to the synergistic effect between the self-networking of the interface-localized SiO2 and the enhanced elasticity of the SiO2-localized PU phase. This inspiring result proves the introduction of nanoparticles with self-networking capability into polymers blends to be a universal platform to design their performance via tuning the phase structure. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "By adding a small amount of acid treated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) into poly( p -phenylene sulfide)/polyamide 66 (60/40 w/w) blends, the morphology was found to change from sea\u2013island to co-continuous structure. As the MWCNT content was increased, the morphology came back to sea\u2013island but with increased domain size. It was very interesting to note that the MWCNTs were found to be selectively located in the PA66 phase, and their assembling determines the final morphology of PPS/PA66 blends. A dendritic contacted MWCNTs network was formed at low load, which leads to the formation of a co-continuous structure, and isolated MWCNT aggregates were observed at high load, which leads to the formation of sea\u2013island morphology. Since the properties of multiphase polymeric materials are not only determined by the properties of the component polymers, but also by the morphology formed, our work indicates that the behavior of phase-separating polymer blends containing MWCNTs can be exploited to create a rich diversity of new structures and useful nanocomposites.",

        "abstract": "Various methods have been devoted to trigger the formation of multilayered structure for wide range of applications. These methods are often complicated with low production efficiency or require complex equipment. Herein, we demonstrate a simple and efficient method for the fabrication of polymeric sheets containing multilayered structure with enhanced barrier property through high speed thin-wall injection molding (HSIM). To achieve this, montmorillonite (MMT) is added into PE first, then blended with PP to fabricate PE-MMT/PP ternary composites. It is demonstrated that alternating multilayer structure could be obtained in the ternary composites because of low interfacial tension and good viscosity match between different polymer components. MMT is selectively dispersed in PE phase with partial exfoliated/partial intercalated microstructure. 2D-WAXD analysis indicates that the clay tactoids in PE-MMT/PP exhibits an uniplanar-axial orientation with their surface parallel to the molded part surface, while the tactoids in binary PE-MMT composites with the same overall MMT contents illustrate less orientation. The enhanced orientation of nanoclay in PE-MMT/PP could be attributed to the confinement of alternating multilayer structure, which prohibits the tumbling and rotation of nanoplatelets. Therefore, the oxygen barrier property of PE-MMT/PP is superior to that of PE-MMT because of increased gas permeation pathway. Comparing with the results obtained for PE based composites in literature, outstanding barrier property performance (45.7% and 58.2% improvement with 1.5 and 2.5 wt % MMT content, respectively) is achieved in current study. Two issues are considered responsible for such improvement: enhanced MMT orientation caused by the confinement in layered structure, and higher local density of MMT in layered structure induced denser assembly. Finally, enhancement in barrier property by confining impermeable filler into alternating multilayer structure through such simple and efficient method could provide a novel route toward high-performance packaging materials and other functional materials require layered structure.",

The latter is a promising engineering plastic with comprehensive mechanical performances. When POK acted as minor phase to homogeneously disperse in and intimately contact with PVDF matrix, the brittle tensile behavior of neat PVDF transferred into a remarkably flexible manner (the elongation at break increased for 20 times), and more interestingly, the room-temperature durability of \u03b2-form PVDF in the uniaxially drawn blend film was obviously better than that in the neat PVDF film. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that specific dipole interaction existed between CF2 group of PVDF and C=O group of POK. The intermolecular dipolar interaction induced good compatibility in the PVDF/POK blends, as evidently proved by fine two-phase morphology and decreased melting points of POK crystals. Therefore, the good compatibility and interfacial enhancement are responsible for the improvement of the stretch ductility and \u03b2-form room-temperature durability of the PVDF/POK blends.",

It is interesting to note that the incorporation of layered clay nanoparticles into DMDBS-nucleated iPP may induce a synergetic nucleation effect while the DMDBS content is below 0.1 wt%, otherwise it restricts the crystallization rate prominently as the DMDBS content increases up to 0.3 wt%, which has exceeded the content threshold to yield a nucleating agent (NA) network. As shown by dynamic rheological investigations, the clay nanoparticles demonstrate an obstructive effect of disturbing the consistency of DMDBS fibrils network. Moreover, to further demonstrate the importance of NA network formation in the crystallization of iPP, we used another NA named HPN-20e, which can not form network structure at all over the concentration studied, for comparison. In this case, the nucleated-crystallization rate is independent on the addition of clay nanoparticles, as the nucleating mechanism is an individual nuclei manner without NA network forming. \u00a9 Chinese Chemical Society.",

To investigate the effect of molecular weight of HDPE on the formation of shish-kebab structure, two kinds HDPE with large melt flow index (low molecular weight) and small melt flow index (high molecular weight) were added into LLDPE matrix. The structural characteristics of LLDPE/HDPE blends were systematically elucidated through two-dimensional wide-angle x-ray scattering, scanning electron microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. Interestingly, an unexpected molecular weight dependence of shish-kebab structure of the prepared samples was found that the addition of HDPE with low molecular weight resulted in an higher degree of orientation, better regularity of lamellar arrangement, thicker lamellar size, and higher crystal melting temperature than that adding HDPE with high molecular weight. Correspondingly, the blend containing low molecular weight HDPE had better tensile strength. A possible mechanism was suggested to elucidate the role of HDPE molecular weight on the formation of shish-kebab structure in the oriented blends, considering the change of chain mobility and entanglement density with change of molecular weight.",

In this work, taking \u03b2-form PP (\u03b2-PP) as example, the microstructural changes induced by annealing were investigated from macromolecular to crystalline lamellae level with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, conventional differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), temperature-modulated DSC (TMDSC), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Besides mobile amorphous fraction (MAF), the role of rigid amorphous fraction (RAF) in toughening PP is particularly taken into consideration. It is shown that annealing increases the chain mobility in MAF and decreases it in RAF. Such an effect is believed to be mainly associated with the formation of looser MAF and more RAF by the microstructural re-arrangement involving conformational ordering of partial amorphous chain segments and a significant interlamellae thickening. A thorough analysis of structure-property relationship through observing plastic deformation behaviors by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and estimating stress transmission between crystalline and amorphous phases, suggests that both MAF and RAF play important role on toughening \u03b2-PP. They can promote the initiation of microvoids effectively upon deformation by reducing the stress transmission. As a result, large-scale plastic deformation is triggered. This work is important and provides a new insight into the mechanisms of microstructural evolution and subsequent improvement in impact toughness during annealing. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

        "title": "Toughening of poly(l-lactide) with poly(\u03b5-caprolactone): Combined effects of matrix crystallization and impact modifier particle size",
        "abstract": "Enhancing matrix crystallization has been demonstrated to be an effective method to simultaneously improve the impact toughness and heat resistance of poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) modified with flexible polymers, such as poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL). Unfortunately, increasing PLLA matrix crystallinity alone cannot guarantee the enhancement of impact toughness in most cases, so other structural parameters should be considered. In this work, taking PLLA/PCL (80/20) blend as an example, the combined roles of matrix crystallization and impact modifier particle size in the toughening have been investigated. PLLA matrix crystallinity was controlled by adding a highly effective nucleating agent and PCL particle size was tailored by varying processing conditions while maintaining constant interfacial adhesion. It is interesting to find that toughening is efficient only if matrix crystallinity and particle size are well matched. With the significant increase of matrix crystallinity, an evident decrease of optimum particle size for toughening PLLA has been identified for the first time. Therefore, suitable particle size is the precondition for highly crystalline matrix to work effectively in the toughening because only small particles (0.3-0.5 \u03bcm) are effective in trigger shear yielding mechanism of the matrix needed for good toughness, whereas relatively large particles (0.7-1.1 \u03bcm) are only capable of toughening amorphous matrix effectively by initiating multiple crazing of the matrix. Importantly, our findings can be used to well explain the reason for the different roles of matrix crystallization in the toughening of different PLLA blends reported in the literature. Furthermore, the heat resistance of the blend with a highly crystalline matrix is much better than that of the blend with an amorphous one as expected. This work could not only provide a new insight into the synergistic roles of matrix crystallization and modifier particle size in the toughening of PLLA but also set up a universal framework for designing high-performance PLLA products with both good impact toughness and high heat resistance. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We first prepared PA6/EPDM- g -MA/organoclay ternary nanocomposites using melt blending. Then the composites were subjected to traditional injection molding and so-called dynamic packing injection molding. The dispersion of clay, phase morphology, crystallinity and orientation of PA6 as well the mechanical properties were characterized by WAXD, SEM, DSC, 2D-WAXS and mechanical testing, respectively. The effects of clay on phase morphology and mechanical properties of PA6/EPDM- g -MA blends could be summarized as follows: (1) weakening interphase adhesion between PA6 and EPDM- g -MA rubber particles, resulted in increasing of rubber particle size, as the clay and rubber contents are low; (2) preventing coalescence of rubber domains, arisen in decreasing of rubber particle size, as the clay and rubber contents are high; (3) the blocking effect on the overlap of stress volume around rubber particles caused broadening of the brittle\u2013ductile transition region and decrease of toughness, and (4) the effective stress transfer leading a better reinforcement when the interparticle distance is smaller than the critical value.",

Even more, the epitaxial growth was found to be dependent on composition of the blends. The sequence of crystallization is not the dominant factor, but the fact that iPP crystallizes before HDPE is prerequisite for epitaxial growth of PE. Various lamellar orientations with composition can be explained by the competition between bulk crystallization and epitaxy at interfaces (i.e. iPP lamellae). In 20PP (20 wt% iPP by weight in blends), HDPE can readily crystallize in the bulk as a result of shear, and no epitaxial growth of PE is observed. For 80PP, however, bulk crystallization of HDPE can be depressed due to lack of nuclei in its bulk, resulting from a much finer droplets dispersed in the iPP matrix, and then epitaxial growth prevails.",

        "abstract": "Autonomously self-healing hydrogels have received considerable attentions owe to their capacity for repairing themselves spontaneously after suffering damage, which can provide better stability and longer lifespan. In this work, a robust, mechanically and electrically self-healing hydrogel with efficient electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding performance was successfully fabricated via the incorporation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) into the hydrophobically associated polyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogels by using cellulose nanofiber (CNF) as dispersant. It has been found that CNF could not only assist the homogeneous dispersion of MWCNTs, but also effectively enhance the mechanical property of the resultant hydrogels. As a result, the optimal tensile strength (\u2248 0.24 MPa), electrical conductivity (\u2248 0.85 S m-1) and EMI shielding effectiveness (\u2248 28.5 dB) were achieved for the PAM/CNF/MWCNT composite hydrogels with 1 wt% MWCNTs and 0.3 wt% CNF, which showed 458%, 844% and 90% increase than those (\u2248 0.043 MPa, \u2248 0.09 S m-1 and \u224815 dB, respectively) of PAM hydrogel. More encouragingly, these composite hydrogels could rapidly restore their electrical conductivity and EMI shielding effectiveness after mechanical damage at room temperature without any external stimulus. With outstanding mechanical and self-healing properties, the prepared composite hydrogels are similar to human skin, but beyond human skin owing to their additional satisfactory electrical and EMI shielding performances. They may offer promising and broad prospects in the field of simulate skin and protection of precision electronics.",

By using this technique, PP with 4-time improvement in toughness or PPR with superior toughness are obtained. Meanwhile, the stiffness of the materials could be maintained. To understand the toughening mechanism, scanning electron microscope, wide angle X-ray diffraction, calorimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis and small angle X-ray scattering characterizations are carried out. It is demonstrated that the toughening mechanism is strongly related to the microstructure evolutions, including decreased chain density in the mobile amorphous phase, improved crystalline phase and improved rigid amorphous phase after annealing. These microstructure changes could result in higher cavitation ability and diminish inner stress in the amorphous phase, which consequently favors improvement in toughness. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

        "title": "Three-dimensional phase morphologies in HDPE/EVA blends obtained via dynamic injection packing molding",
        "abstract": "The formation of phase morphology of injection molded HDPE/EVA blends, under the effect of shear stress, has been investigated in detail. The shear stress was induced by dynamic packing injection molding, by which a specimen is forced to move repeatedly in the model by two pistons that move reversibly with the same frequency during cooling. Two kinds of EVA with VA content 16 wt% (16EVA) and 33 wt% (33EVA) were used to investigate the effect of interfacial tension. The phase morphology was viewed both parallel and perpendicular to the shear flow direction, so one can get an overall three-dimensional phase morphology. Low shear stress provided by the pistons has a substantial effect on the phase morphology along the flow direction but is insignificant in the direction perpendicular to the flow direction. Generally, a much elongated and layer-like structure is formed along the flow direction, and spherical droplet-like morphology is formed perpendicular to the flow direction, and the degree of deformation of rubber particles also depends upon their size and elasticity as well as on the interfacial properties between matrix and dispersed phase. For static samples of HDPE/16EVA blends (without shearing), only droplet morphology is formed as 16EVA content increases from10 to 40 wt%. However, under the effect of shear stress (dynamic samples), both droplet and cylinder morphologies can be formed depending on the volume ratio. For static samples of HDPE/33EVA blends, not only droplet, but also cylinder and co-continuous morphology (perpendicular to flow direction) can be formed depending on the volume ratio. For dynamic samples of HDPE/33EVA blends, droplet, cylinder and co-continuous network (co-continuous in both parallel and perpendicular to flow direction) can be formed under the effect of shear stress. The formation of phase morphology is discussed based on interfacial interaction, viscosity ratio, shear stress, and phase inversion. Keywords Phase morphology Shear stress Elongated particles 1 Introduction One of the key factors, to achieve desired final properties is the controlling of the phase morphology. The morphology resulting from blending and processing depends mainly on the rheological and interfacial properties, the blending conditions, and the volume ratio of the components [1\u20135] . During processing, the morphological evolution in polymer blends is related to mechanisms such as elongated drop disintegration, minor phase relaxation, and coarsening [6\u20138] . The size and the deformation of a purely viscous (Newtonian) droplet surrounded by another Newtonian fluid is determined mainly by two parameters [9\u201311] : (1) the phase viscosity ratio ( \u03bb ) (1) \u03bb= \u03b7 d \u03b7 m where \u03b7 d and \u03b7 m are the viscosities of the dispersed and matrix, respectively, and (2) the k -term of the form (2) k= \u03c3 \u03b7 m \u03b3 \u0307 R where \u03c3 , interfacial tension, \u03b3 \u0307 , shear rate and R , droplet radius. The meaning of the k -term is a balance between the resistance to deformation of the droplet ( \u03c3 / R ) and the local acting shear stress (\u03b7 m \u03b3 \u0307 ) that causes the droplet deformation. For the polymers of viscoelastic rather than of viscous nature, \u03c3 in the k -term has to be corrected by a factor that considers the effect of the normal forces arising from the elasticity of the phases. A theoretical model for viscosity estimation of blends of stratified morphology has been proposed [12] . The transitions between droplets and stratified morphologies require a change in the melt elasticity ratio of the components. However, once the shear stress stops, the minor phase will relax and cause the deformed droplets to recover. Only if the morphology in the flow field is quenched instantaneously can the fibril or stratified morphology, that is only stable in flow, be preserved [13] . For instance, during the injection molding with higher injection speed, the skin layer, in close contact with the mold, quenches first. The minor phase morphology in this layer is frozen almost instantaneously. Thus, contact with the mold surface locally hinders the fibril disintegration and coalescence that takes place in the core, where the appearance of the spherical droplets may be attributed either to the elastic recovery and/or to the breaking up of the fibrils. Therefore, the minor phase morphology of this essentially quenched layer is very different from that of the core of the injection molded blends. Recently, in our group, during the stage of packing molding when the melt is injected into the cavity, the shear stress has been introduced by means of hydraulically actuated pistons [14,15] . Instead of the skin and core-like structure as seen in the samples injected by the traditional way, a morphology of core in the center and oriented zone surrounding the core and the skin layer is observed for the dynamic samples [16,17] . We have investigated the phase morphology and the deformation of dispersed particles in PP/EPDM blends [16] , and the elongated rubber particles have been observed. In previous work [17] , super HDPE/EVA blends having high modulus (1.9\u20132.2 GPa), high tensile strength (100\u2013120 MPa) and high impact strength (six times as that of pure HDPE) have been prepared by controlling the phase separation, molecular orientation and crystal morphology of the blends. The enhancement of tensile strength and modulus was believed to originate from the formation of the oriented layer, while the high impact strength was considered to be related to shear induced phase morphology. However, in the previous works, only the mechanical properties along shear flow direction were measured because a dumbbell specimen was used. For an oriented sample, the mechanical properties and morphology in both parallel and perpendicular to the shear flow direction should be measured. In order to investigate the effect of mechanical properties and phase morphology in the direction of orientation, in this paper, a square specimen was used. We have carried out a systematic investigation on the formation of phase morphology in HDPE/EVA blends under the effect of shear stress. In order to elucidate the difference of morphology in various layers of both dynamic and static specimens, a schematic representation is shown in Fig. 1 . Obviously, the shear imposes a significant effect on the morphology of the dynamic specimen (with shearing) and forms the so-called skin-oriented layer-core texture. This is totally different from the static specimen (without shearing) whose morphology consists of skin and core layer. The morphological difference at different layers is obvious and needs to be carefully investigated. However, due to the complicated skin-oriented layer-core morphology of the dynamic specimen, we cannot go into detail to discuss the phase morphologies at each layer for each composition. In this work, only the phase morphology formed in the oriented layer of the dynamic specimen is investigated to see the effect of shear stress and also for simplicity. The morphology at the same place in the core layer of the static specimen has also been investigated for comparison. The phase morphology in different directions (viewed along the shear flow or perpendicular to the flow direction) was checked to get an overall three-dimensional picture of phase morphology. The effect of viscosity ratio, interfacial tension, volume ratio and shear stress on the final morphology was discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials The HDPE and EVAs, used in the experiment, are all commercialized products, and are summarized in Table 1 . Two kinds of EVA were used with VA content 16 wt% (16EVA) and 33 wt% (33EVA), respectively. The melt flow index of EVA increases with VA content. 2.2 Samples preparation Melt blending of HDPE/EVA was conducted using a TSSJ-25 co-rotating twin-screw extruder set at a barrel temperature of 160\u2013190 \u00b0C. After making droplets, the blends were injected into a 68\u00d760\u00d74 mm 3 mold, using a SZ 100 g injection molding machine set at 180 \u00b0C and 900 kg cm \u22122 . During the cooling, dynamic packing injection molding technology was applied, which relies on the application of shear stress fields to melt/solid interfaces during the packing stage by means of hydraulically actuated pistons. The maximum shear rate was 10\u201330 s \u22121 . The schematic representation of this technology is shown in Fig. 2 . The detailed experimental procedures and the experimental devices were described in Ref. [14] . The processing parameters are listed in Table 2 . Injection molding under static packing by using the same processing parameters was also carried out for comparison. 2.3 Scanning electron microscope The phase morphology of HDPE/EVA blends was studied with an X-650 Hitachi scanning electron microscope at 20 kV. The specimens were fractured in liquid nitrogen, then preferentially etched in benzene. The etching process was allowed to continue for 24 hours at about 40 \u00b0C to reach the equilibrium condition. The solvent was removed from the specimen later using vacuum extraction. The surface was then coated with gold and subsequently examined. 3 Results 3.1 Phase morphology under the quiescent state Fig. 3 shows the scanning electron microscope (SEM) photographs of fractured surface perpendicular to the flow direction of static samples of HDPE/33EVA blends with 33EVA content from 10 to 40 wt%. The black domains indicate the position of the extracted EVA phase. One observes a sea\u2013island structure in the composition investigated up to 30 wt% of 33EVA, which indicates that EVA forms a dispersed phase and HDPE forms a continuous phase in these composition ranges. A co-continuous like morphology is seen at 40 wt% of 33EVA. The shape of EVA dispersed phase is spherical with a size of 0.5\u20131.0 \u03bcm when 33EVA content is no more than 20 wt%. However, as the 33EVA content reaches 30 wt%, the rubber particles become slightly elongated and the irregular rubber particles with a much larger size are seen at 40 wt% of 33EVA. For comparison, the phase morphology along the flow direction is also examined. Compared with the morphology viewed perpendicular to the flow direction, much more elongated particles (at low EVA content) and even highly oriented layer morphology (at high EVA content) are seen, as expected. The SEM pictures of the fractured surface of HDPE/33EVA=80/20 and 60/40 are shown in Fig. 4 , as examples of phase morphology along flow direction. Instead of a co-continuous like structure, one observes a parallel layer structure. So one must be very careful to deal with the morphology having anisotropic property. The morphologies viewed in different directions are needed to get the overall three-dimensional picture. Fig. 5 shows the SEM photographs of fractured surface perpendicular to the flow direction of static samples of HDPE/16EVA blends with 16EVA content from 10 to 40 wt%. Compared with HDPE/33EVA blends, much smaller rubber particles (0.2\u20130.5 \u03bcm) are present, due to the better interaction between these two components. It should be noted that no phase inversion (co-continuous phase) is seen in the composition range investigated. Again the morphology along the flow direction is shown in Fig. 6 . One observes a very similar morphology as in Fig. 5 , and no remarkable deformation of particles is seen even along the flow direction. This may be attributed to the small size of rubber particles and/or better interfacial interaction. The elastic recovery may also play a role in this case due to the higher modulus of 16EVA compared with that of 33EVA. Combined with the phase morphology parallel to the flow direction and perpendicular to the flow direction together, the three-dimensional phase morphology can be built up. The morphologies of static samples as a function of EVA content are schematically shown in Fig. 7 . For HDPE/16EVA blends, only droplet morphology is formed as 16EVA content increases from10 to 40 wt%. However, for HDPE/33EVA blends, not only droplet, but also cylinder and co-continuous morphology (perpendicular to flow direction) can be formed depending on the volume ratio. 3.2 Phase morphology under low shear stress The SEM pictures of fractured surface of HDPE/33EVA=70/30 and 60/40 are shown in Fig. 8 , as examples of phase morphology of dynamic samples viewed perpendicular to the flow direction. Very similar morphologies are seen as shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d) for static samples viewed perpendicular to the flow direction. Here again one observes slightly elongated particles at 30 wt% 33EVA content and a co-continuous like structure at 40 wt% 33EVA content. For dynamic samples, however, one is concerned much more with the morphology viewed along the flow direction where the effect of shear stress is mostly demonstrated. Fig. 9 shows the morphological development of HDPE/33EVA blends along the flow direction as a function of 33EVA content under shear stress. It can be seen that the shape of particles become much more elongated with increasing 33EVA content. A big jump of particle size and a co-continuous-like morphology occurs at 40 wt% of 33EVA content. So different from the static sample with 40 wt% 33EVA content, where a co-continuous-like morphology is seen only in the direction perpendicular to the flow direction, for a dynamic sample with the same composition, a co-continuous like morphology is observed both parallel and perpendicular to flow direction under the effect of shear stress. For HDPE/16EVA blends, droplet morphology is formed at low 16EVA content, but much-elongated particles are seen at a high 16EVA content along the flow direction for dynamic samples, as shown in Fig. 10 . One observes a layer-like structure for HDPE/16EVA=70/30 and 60/40 blends due to high orientation of particles along the flow direction under the effect of shear stress. However, the thickness of the layer is much smaller than the layer formed in HDPE/33EAV blends. Fig. 11 shows the morphological development of HDPE/16EVA blends perpendicular to the flow direction as a function of 16EVA content for dynamic samples. A droplet-morphology with constant particle size is seen for all the compositions studied (16EVA content changes from 20 to 40 wt%). In summary, combined with the phase morphology parallel to the flow direction and perpendicular to the flow direction together, the three-dimensional morphologies of dynamic samples, as a function of EVA content are schematically shown in Fig. 12 . For HDPE/16EVA blends, both droplet and cylinder morphologies can be formed depending on the volume ratio. For HDPE/33EVA blends, droplet, cylinder and co-continuous network (co-continuous both in parallel and perpendicular to flow direction) can be formed under the effect of shear stress. 4 Discussions 4.1 The effect of viscosity ratio \u03bb and k -term In the steady shear flow, a purely viscous spherical droplet surrounded by another Newtonian fluid will be deformed to ellipse [18] , which is shown in Fig. 13 . Theoretical calculation and experimental observations have proven that its deformation is dominated by the cooperative effect of viscosity ratio \u03bb and k -term [19,20] and the orientation angle of droplets in the shear flow field can be characterized by the equation as follows: (3) \u03b8= \u03c0 4 + 1 2 tan \u22121 (19\u03bb/40k) where \u03b8 , the angle between velocity gradient and the major axis of ellipse, which is also indicated in Fig. 13 . According to the Eq. (3) , Vanoene [10] has proposed that while k \u226b \u03bb , the major axis of droplets is oblique to the flow direction and this can illustrate that the factor of interfacial tension is dominated. Instead, while \u03bb \u226b k , the major axis of droplets is parallel to flow direction, which indicates that the factor of viscosity is dominated. In our case, from these SEM photographs, for every composition the rubber particles are all elongated along the flow direction. Therefore, it can be concluded that in the low shear stress field it is the factor of viscosity rather than the factor of interfacial tension that dominate the deformation along the flow direction. Therefore, in this case, the contribution of interfacial tension to the deformation of droplets along the flow direction may only act through the change in the size of rubber particles. The effect of interfacial tension on the phase morphology is demonstrated by a substantial reduction in particle size in HDPE/16EVA blends. The reduced particle size is understood as resulting from the reduced interfacial tension. According to Eq. (2) , the smaller the droplets, the greater is the resistance to deformation. So one always observes less deformed particles in HDPE/16EVA blends. Of course, the elastic recovery may also play a role in this case due to the higher modulus of 16EVA compared with that of 33EVA. The effect of elastic recovery could be understood from the Rayleigh\u2013Taylor\u2013Tomotika theory [18,21] and the experimental observation was also found from Karger\u2013Kocsis's work [22] Furthermore, the viscosity ratio will also affect the deformation of rubber particles, as predicted by Eq. (1) . The melt viscosity of the three materials (HDPE, 16EVA, and 33EVA) as a function of shear rate is measured by using a high-pressure capillary rheometer Rheograph 2002 (Gottfert) with a 1 mm die and L / D ratio of 30 at 180 \u00b0C over a shear rate range, \u03b3 \u0307 , from 10 1 to 10 4 s \u22121 and is shown in Fig. 14 . Clearly, in the whole shear rate rank, the viscosity of 16EVA is the highest, and that of HDPE sets in the middle, and that of 33EVA is the lowest. Considering the high pressure injection molding and low pressure packing, the viscosity ratios were determined at 180 \u00b0C for the shear rate of 10 and 30 s \u22121 , respectively (see Table 3 ) . For HDPE/33EVA blends, as the elasticity of the low viscosity of 33EVA is smaller than that of the HDPE, interfacial tension \u03c3 is reduced under shear stress, according to Oene [23] , resulting in pronounced deformability. For HDPE/16EVA blends, due to the higher viscosity of 16EVA and its better interaction with the HDPE, stabilization of the initial spherical droplet shape and less deformed particles are expected. It should be noted that the effect of reduced interfacial tension is twofold; it makes the droplets smaller on one hand, and also makes them more deformable on the other hand. 4.2 The effect of shear stress and region of phase inversion As discussed above, for injection molded HDPE/EVA blends, the phase morphology is quite complicated. The effect of shear stress is evident from the anisotropy distribution of EVA size and the deformation of particles. The greater the shear stress, the easier is the deformation. Not only is this then in the deformation of particles, but also the shear induced phase separation at low shear rates are reported [24\u201326] . The effect of shear fields on phase behavior is theoretically interpreted in terms of the enhancement of concentration fluctuations and the elastic contribution to the free energy of mixing. In the processing of polymer blends, with the increasing concentration of the minor phase, particles become close enough to behave as if they were connected. Further addition of minor phase material extends the continuity network until the minor phase is continuous throughout the sample. According to the percolation theory, the phase inversion occurs, which depends upon the viscosity ratio and composition. To estimate the point of phase inversion, the model proposed by Paul and Barlow [27] is: (4) \u03b7 1 \u03b7 2 \u03c6 2 \u03c6 1 =1 where \u03c6 x is the volume fraction of x at phase inversion, and \u03b7 x is the viscosity of phase. However, the equation does not always predict the region of phase inversion correctly, especially when blending material with a large difference in melt viscosity. Therefore, Chen and Su [28] have proposed an alternative equation: (5) \u03c6 hv \u03c6 lv =1.2 \u03b7 hv \u03b7 lv 0.3 where the subscripts \u2018hv\u2019 and \u2018lv\u2019 denote the high and the low viscosity phase, respectively. In order to calculate the viscosity ratio, \u03bb , of the blend components for the applied processing conditions, capillary rheometry measurements were performed at the processing temperature of 180 \u00b0C. In general, shear rates for conventional large-scale injection equipment are situated in the orders of 10 2 s \u22121 [2] . And for our dynamic injection packing molding, during the stage of packing the shear rate added by the position is estimated to be in the order of 10 1 s \u22121 . From Fig. 14 and Table 3 , one can easily predict the region of phase inversion via Eqs. (4) and (5) , and the result is also listed in Table 3 . It is pronounced that the region of phase inversion for HDPE/16EVA and HDPE/33EVA blends is approximately 0.60\u20130.65 and 0.35\u20130.40 of EVA, respectively. The data from Eq. (5) fits well with the experimental observation. Under the combined effect of shear stress and low viscosity ratio between HDPE and 33EVA, the co-continuous phase is also seen along the flow direction under the effect of shear stress at 40 wt% of 33EVA content. 5 Conclusion Three-dimensional phase morphology of HDPE/EVA blends has been obtained. The shear stress, interfacial tension, viscosity ratio and volume ratio have great effect on the size of dispersed particles and the degree of deformation. Compared with the morphology viewed perpendicular to the flow direction, the phase morphology along the flow direction changes dramatically under the effect of shear stress. Generally, elongated and layer-like structures are formed along the flow direction, and spherical droplet-like morphology is formed perpendicular to the flow direction. For static samples of HDPE/16EVA blends (without shearing), only droplet morphology is formed as 16EAV content increases from10 to 40 wt%. However, for static samples of HDPE/33EVA blends, not only droplet, but also cylinder and co-continuous morphology (perpendicular to flow direction) can be formed depending on the volume ratio. For dynamic samples of HDPE/16EVA blends (under the effect of shear stress), both droplet and cylinder morphologies can be formed depending on the volume ratio. For dynamic samples of HDPE/33EVA blends, droplet, cylinder and co-continuous network (co-continuous both in parallel and perpendicular to flow direction) can be formed under the effect of shear stress.

        "abstract": "The fractionated crystallization behavior of the minor dispersed HDPE phase in PS/POE/HDPE/SBS quaternary blends was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Interestingly, we found that the fractionated crystallization behavior of HDPE was molecular weight dependent. At a fixed composition, HDPE with lower molecular weight showed more obvious fractionated crystallization behavior than HDPE with higher molecular weight. This was ascribed to a finer dispersion of HDPE with lower molecular weight, as evidenced by SEM observations. The fractionated crystallization behavior of HDPE in the blends became less obvious with increasing of its content, due to a change of phase morphology from droplet to co-continuous structure. Correspondingly, a change of tensile toughness of the blends from brittle to ductile mode was observed. \u00a9 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.",

        "abstract": "A simple and effective method to add large amounts of expanded graphite (EG) to poly (phenylene sulfide) (PPS) was developed. Before conventional melt processing, solid-state PPS and EG powders were mixed using high-speed rotation. In this way, the loose and porous vermicular structure of EG could be effectively destroyed and partly exfoliated, which made EG easy to be adsorbed on the surface of the PPS powders. This was extraordinarily helpful to achieve good dispersions of EG during the subsequent melt mixing even at high loading, which was difficult to achieve by conventional direct melt mixing. As a result of the good dispersions and strong interactions, the EG/PPS composites prepared showed a dramatically improved thermal conductivity (15.8 Wm-1K -1) and electrical conductivity (125.3 Sm-1) as the addition of EG reached 60 wt%. \u00a9 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

        "abstract": "It is feasible to control the phase morphology and orientation for immiscible polymer blends to manipulate their properties. In this paper, the blend of polyamide 1010 (PA1010) and isotactic polypropylene (iPP) (mainly at a fixed ratio of PA1010/iPP = 80/20) was used as an example to demonstrate the effect of shear on the morphology and resultant mechanical properties. After being melt blended, the injection-molded bars were prepared via a dynamic packing equipment to impose a prolonged shearing on the melts during the solidification stage. By controlling the shear time, the structure evolution and morphological development of the blends can be well controlled. Mechanical measurement of the molded bar showed a dramatically improved tensile property and impact strength with increasing shear time. Morphological examination revealed that the iPP droplets are elongated and become thin fibrils along the shear direction with increasing shear time. The shear-induced fibrillation, instead of orientation, is believed to be responsible for the largely improved properties of the blend, particularly for the impact strength. The toughening mechanism is discussed based on the combined effect of hindrance of crack propagation and the transferring and bearing of the load due to the existence of the fibrils. This was further proved by changing the blending ratio and using low molecular weight iPP. Finally, we propose a concept for designing blending materials with good comprehensive properties.

        "abstract": "Conductive network morphology and interfacial interaction play important roles in determining resistivity-strain (\ufffd\ufffd- \ufffd\ufffd) sensing behavior of conductive polymer composites (CPCs). In this work, thermoplastic elastomer blends consisting of poly(styrene-butadiene-styrene) block polymer (SBS) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) were fabricated via different melt processing procedures, which could tune the above two issues simultaneously by selectively localizing multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in SBS, TPU and both in SBS and TPU, respectively. It is observed that the composite fibers with selectively localized MWCNTs show distinct different \ufffd\ufffd- \ufffd\ufffd sensing behavior. Work of adhesion calculation suggests stronger interfacial interaction between MWCNTs and SBS, however, wetting coefficient calculation indicates slightly better wetting of MWCNTs with TPU. Because of such stronger interaction and poorer dispersion, the composite fiber with MWCNTs distributed in SBS exhibits higher \ufffd\ufffd- \ufffd\ufffd sensitivity than its counterpart with MWCNTs distributed in TPU, and with MWCNTs distributed in both phases, the \ufffd\ufffd- \ufffd\ufffd sensitivity lies in between. Moreover, the \ufffd\ufffd- \ufffd\ufffd sensing behavior was fitted with a model based on tunneling theory by Simmons. It is suggested that the change in tunneling distance and the number of conductive pathways could be accelerated significantly under strong interfacial interaction. This study could offer a new pathway and provide a guideline for the preparation of high-performance CPC resistivity-strain sensors with tunable sensitivity. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

In this work, a new method is proposed to improve the interfacial crystallization between semi-crystalline polymer and glass fiber (GF) by introducing graphene oxide (GO) to the surface of amorphous GF. The coating of GO on GF surface is realized via electrostatic self-assembling of the oppositely charged GO and amino coupling agent modified GF (GF-NH2). After the thermal reduction of the coated GO (RGO), RGO coated GF (GF-RGO) is obtained. The interfacial crystallization of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) on the surface of raw GF, GF-NH2, and GF-RGO are investigated using Polarized light microscope (PLM). It is found that raw GF and GF-NH2 has almost no nucleation ability on the polymers crystallization. However, transcrystalline structure can be successfully induced at the polymers/GF-RGO interface, indicating a significantly improved nucleation ability of GF-RGO for polymer crystallization. This work could provide a new way to control interfacial crystallization, thus the interfacial adhesion of polymer/filler composites, and could also find a new application for GO as well. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Graphene oxide (GO) is derived from oxidization of natural graphite and contains many active groups. These active groups make GO a potential compatibilizer for polymer blends or coupling agent for polymer composites. In this work, a novel core-shell structured hybrid submicroparticles of graphene oxide-encapsulated silica (GO-SiO 2) were fabricated using GO sheets via an electrostatic assembly between ultrathin negatively charged graphene oxide sheets and positively charged amino-modified silica. The possible application of this new hybrid filler was explored in preparation of maleated polypropylene (PP-g-MA)/GO-SiO 2 composites. The microstructure and interface enhancement of the prepared composites were analyzed by SEM, TEM, OM, TGA, FTIR, and DMA measurements. A uniform dispersion of GO-SiO 2 hybrids, enhanced interfacial adhesion and improved mechanical property were evidenced. The reason might be that graphene oxide can be covalently assembled onto the amino-modified silica surface, and simultaneously it provides strong interaction with the PP-g-MA due to similar polarity or possible hydrogen bonding. This work suggests a potential application of graphene oxide-encapsulated particle in preparation of high performance polymer composites. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Shish structure and its relaxation dependence of re-crystallization of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) from an oriented melt, caused by melting of shish kebab in original samples (indicated by 2D SAXS and 2D-wide-angle X-ray scattering experiments (2D WAXS) measurements), has been investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and optical microscopy (OM). Shish was obtained by dynamic packing injection molding and its size was controlled by addition of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). An increase in shish size was observed with increasing of HDPE content, as indicated by an increase in the crystallization temperature for iPP during re-crystallization. This is understood as, on one hand, the overall decrease in viscosity by addition of HDPE, thus an increase in shear rate. Higher shear rate can promote larger orientation of molecules and continuous growth of shish structure. On the other hand, the relaxation mode of shish in the melt while re-crystallization is also dominated by its size. Shish with larger size has higher thermal stability and can endure more duration time in the melt. Even more, shish with a larger size cannot be transformed to random coil entirely even subjected to annealing at 200 \u00b0C for 60 min, and thus re-crystallization via self-seeding is always observed on primary nuclei originated from shish structure. A permanent ordered structure, most likely with chain helical conformation, is proposed for iPP with large shish size. However, shish with smaller size can only maintain for a short time and then relax into random coil completely, resulting in almost absence of self-seeding in re-crystallization. Re-crystallization of isotactic polypropylene was discussed based on: (1) self-seeding with respect to size of shish structure and (2) relaxation of shish with different size.

        "abstract": "Injection-molded products usually show hierarchical structure from skin to core due to the existence of shear gradient and temperature gradient. Investigating the hierarchical structure is helpful to better understand the structure-property relationship of injection-molded sample, which is important for design and preparation of polymer products with high performance. In this work, the hierarchical structures of injection-molded bars of high-density polyethylene (HDPE)/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) composite were explored by examining the microstructure and crystal morphology, layer by layer, along the sample thickness, using SEM, DSC and 2D-WAXS. To enhance the shear effect, a so-called dynamic packing injection molding (DPIM) technique was used to prepare the molded bar with high orientation level. Interestingly, SEM revealed that in the skin and core zones, the lamellae of PE anchored randomly on the surface of MWCNTs, while well-defined nanohybrid shish-kebab (NHSK) entities, in which fibrillous carbon nanotubes (CNTs) act as shish while HDPE lamellae act as kebab, exist in the oriented zone. The changed NHSK crystal structure along the thickness direction of molded bar is considered as due to the shear gradient and thermal gradient in injection molding. And the underlying origin of in situ formation of NHSK under shear effects is discussed based on experimental observations. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Then they subjected to tensile testing. It was found that the composite fibers obtained at low drown ratio showed no obvious enhancement of tensile strength and elongation at break, compared with the pure PLLA fibers obtained at the same low drown ratio. However, a significant property enhancement was observed for the composites fibers obtained at high drown ratio. Structure analysis of the as spun fibers before and after tensile testing suggests a possible stretching induced formation of brush-like hybrid structure in which the PLLA lamellae growing perpendicular to the SWNTs axis for fibers obtained at high drown ratio.

        "title": "Dependence of impact strength on the fracture propagation direction in dynamic packing injection molded PP/EPDM blends",
        "abstract": "In order to further understand the brittle\u2013ductile (B\u2013D) transition in PP/EPDM blends, a shear stress field achieved via dynamic packing injection molding was used to control the rubber particles as elongated and orientated in the PP matrix. The impact strength of the blends was measured in three fracture directions, namely, along the shear flow direction, perpendicular to and oblique (45\u00b0) with the flow direction. A definite B\u2013D transition of impact strength was found at 20 wt% of EPDM content along the shear flow direction. About 10 times increase of impact strength was observed at the B\u2013D transition. However, a B\u2013D transition and then a decrease of impact strength brittle\u2013ductile\u2013brittle (B\u2013D\u2013B) was found as increasing of EPDM content in the impact direction perpendicular to and oblique with the flow direction. One observes a big increase of impact strength at 20\u201330 wt% of EPDM content (B\u2013D transition) from 10\u201320 to 70\u201380 kJ/m 2 , then a sharp decrease of impact strength is seen when EPDM content reaches to 30\u201345 wt% (D\u2013B transition) from 70\u201380 to 40\u201350 kJ/m 2 . Correspondingly, there exists a change of rubber particles from roughly spherical shape to highly elongated and oriented shape at D\u2013B transition. SEM shows a very smooth fractured surface when fracture propagation is along or oblique with the shear flow direction, but a lay-by-layer fracture behavior when fracture propagation is perpendicular to the shear flow direction. Our results suggest that the impact fracture direction with respect to the orientation direction play an important role to determine the impact strength. Wu's theory holds true as long as the rubber particles are roughly spherical when viewed in the same direction with fracture propagation direction, but no longer valid when dispersed rubber particles are elongated and oriented when viewed in the direction perpendicular to or oblique with the fracture propagation direction. Keywords PP/EPDM blends Fracture propagation direction Ductile\u2013brittle transition 1 Introduction One of the most important findings in polymer-toughing is so called critical matrix ligament thickness ( T c ) theory, that developed by Wu after an investigation on Nylon 6/EPDM blends [1\u20134] , and extended by Qi after an investigation on PP/EPDM blends [5,6] . For the first time, the model correlated the impact toughness with the phase morphology. It is proposed that T c is the only parameter to determine the brittle\u2013ductile (B\u2013D) transition of the blends. Only when the matrix ligament thickness ( T ) is smaller than T c , the shear yielding of matrix ligament exist and B\u2013D transition of blends occurs. More than 10 times increase of impact strength was observed for PP/EPDM blends at the B\u2013D transition. Nevertheless, Wu's theory has a prerequisite: the rubber particles are considered as cubic or spherical and randomly distributed in the matrix. If the rubber particles are elongated, the stress field around a particle will not be homogeneous anymore. Much great stress concentration will be expected at the tip than the other directions. \u201cDoes the T c criterion still holds true?\u201d \u201cOr what will happen?\u201d Also, for a oriented polymer blend, the impact fracture direction with respect to the orientation direction play an important role to determine the impact strength. Recently, the dynamic packing injection molding (DPIM) was used by our group to control the phase morphology and rubber particle orientation in iPP/EPDM and HDPE/EVA blends [7\u20139] . The relative impact strength of the blends was found to increase at low EPDM content, then a definite ductile\u2013brittle (D\u2013B) transition was observed when rubber content reaches a certain value at which the blends should fail in ductile mode by conventional molding. The results showed not only T c but also the stress fields around individual particle play an important role to determine the impact strength of polymer blends. However, the samples in our previous work were dumbbell shaped and the impact strength of the blends can only be measured as fracture propagation perpendicular to the shear flow direction and not along or oblique to the shear flow direction. Since the fracture direction also play roles to determine the impact strength, further fracture experiments are needed on samples with different orientation with respect to the fracture propagation direction. To do this, a rectangle specimen dimension, as shown in Fig. 1 , is needed, which allows us to get the impact strength both parallel and perpendicular to the shear flow directions. In this work, we will focus on the dependence of impact strength on fracture direction of PP/EPDM blends obtained by DPIM. The impact strength of the blends was measured in three fracture directions, namely, along the shear flow direction, perpendicular to and 45\u00b0 with the flow direction. Very interestingly, not only a definite B\u2013D transition of impact strength was found when the fracture propagation is along shear flow direction, but also a brittle\u2013ductile\u2013brittle (B\u2013D\u2013B) transition was found when fracture propagation is perpendicular to or oblique with the flow direction. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials The polypropylene (PP) and rubber (EPDM) used in the experiment are commercial products, PP (2401) was purchased from the Yan Shan Petroleum Chemical, China (melt flow index is 2.5 g/10 min); and EPDM (EP35, JSR) was purchased from Japan Synthetic Rubber Co. Ltd, the polypropylene (C3) content is 43%. 2.2 Samples preparation Melt blending of PP/EPDM was conducted using twin-screw extruder (TSSJ-25 co-rotating twin-screw extruder) set at a barrel temperature of 160\u2013190 \u00b0C. After making granules, the blends were injected into a mold whose size is 68\u00d760\u00d74 mm, using SZ 100 g injection molding machine set at 180 \u00b0C and 900 kg cm \u22122 . Then during the cooling, DPIM technology was applied, which relies on the application of shear stress fields to melt/solid interfaces during the packing stage by means of hydraulically actuated pistons. The maximum shear rate was 10\u201330 s \u22121 . The schematic representation of this technology is shown in Fig. 1 .The detailed experiment procedures and the experimental devices are described in Ref. [10] . The main feature is that after the melt is injected into the mold, the specimen is forced to move repeatedly in a chamber by two pistons that move reversibly with the same frequency as the solidification progressively occurs from the mold wall to the molding core part. The processing parameters are listed in Table 1 . We also carried out injection molding under static packing by using the same processing parameters but without shearing for comparison purpose. The specimen obtained by DPIM is called dynamic sample, and the specimen obtained by static packing injection molding is called static sample. 2.3 Mechanical properties measurement Shimadzu AG-10TA Universal Testing Machine was used to measure the stress\u2013strain curves, the moving speed was 50 mm/min and the measure temperature was 20 \u00b0C. The samples for tensile testing were rectangular with a size of 10\u00d760 mm. There was necking when the stress\u2013strain curves were measured, and the stress was plotted based on original cross-sectional area. So the engineering stress\u2013strain curve instead of true stress\u2013strain curve was obtained. For Izod impact strength measurement, a notch with 45\u00b0 was made by machine and remained width is 8.0 mm. The experiment was carried out on an I200XJU-2.75 Impact tester according to ISO 179 and the measure temperature was 20 \u00b0C. The values of all the mechanical parameters are calculated as averages over six to nine specimens for each composition. In order to investigate the dependence of impact strength on the heterogeneity caused by the shear flow, the samples for characterization are cut from different direction. The specimen cut along shear flow direction is called parallel sample, cut perpendicular to the shear flow is called vertical sample and cut along 45\u00b0 with the flow direction is called oblique sample. Similarly, the specimens according to ASTMD638M for tensile experiment have been prepared. 2.4 SEM experiment The phase morphologies of the blends were studied by preferential etching of the EPDM phase in toluene for two hours. The samples were fractured in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the shear direction (flow direction) in liquid nitrogen prior to etching. The impact-fractured surface was directly examined after impact experiment. Then the morphology was observed in an SEM instrument, JSM-5900LV, operating at 20 KV. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Typical stress\u2013strain curves Fig. 2 shows the typical stress\u2013strain curves of specimens prepared by dynamic packing and static packing. For static packing, not much difference is seen for stress\u2013strain curves between parallel samples and vertical samples due to the relative homogeneous in the samples. So stress\u2013strain curve (and other mechanical properties, such as tensile strength and impact strength) for static samples, only in one direction (parallel to flow direction) is given in this work. The general trend is that the elongation increases as increasing of EPDM content in the composition range studied (up to 40 wt% of EPDM content), combined with the decrease of tensile stress ( Fig. 2(a) ). This phenomenon is quite well known and nothing special. For dynamic packing, however, a quite big difference is seen between parallel samples and vertical samples. Two things are typical for parallel samples. One is the higher tensile strength and the other is the much longer elongation compared with static samples. Further, one observes an increase of elongation at low EPDM content but decreases with the increase of EPDM content at higher EPDM content ( Fig. 2(b) ). A maximum of elongation is seen at EPDM content around 20\u201325 wt%. For vertical samples, the same stress\u2013strain curves are observed as that for static samples ( Fig. 2(c) ), that is the elongation increase as increasing of EPDM content combined with the decrease of tensile stress. The tensile strengths of PP/EPDM blends along different directions obtained by DPIM are shown in Fig. 3 as a function of composition, the tensile strength of static samples is also included for comparison. One finds almost a linear decrease of tensile strength as increasing of EPDM content for all the samples, as expected. The parallel samples have the highest tensile strength and the vertical samples have the lowest tensile strength. The oblique samples lie in-between. This can be well understood as due to the molecular chain orientation along shear flow direction. Interestingly, the vertical sample has the same tensile strength as that of static sample up to 15 wt% of EPDM content but a lower tensile strength than that of static sample when EPDM content is more than 15 wt%. The oblique sample, on the other hand, has a higher tensile strength than that of static sample up to 20 wt% of EPDM content, but a very close tensile strength as that of static sample when EPDM content is more than 20 wt%. 3.2 The impact strength We have seen the dependence of elongation and tensile strength on the tensile direction for the dynamic samples of PP/EPDM blends, due to the molecular orientation induced by shear stress. Similarly, one expects the effect of fracture propagation direction on the impact strength. The impact strength along three fracture propagation directions is measured, that is parallel to the shear flow direction (vertical sample), perpendicular to the shear flow direction (parallel sample) and 45\u00b0 with the shear flow direction (oblique sample). This is shown in Fig. 4 , the impact strength for static sample is also included for comparison. A definite B\u2013D transition of impact strength was found at 20 wt% of EPDM content measured along shear flow direction (vertical sample, Fig. 4(c) ). This result is similar to the static sample ( Fig. 4(d) ), and in agreement with other reports obtained via conventional molding [5,6] . However, compared with the static sample, the B\u2013D transition shifts to slightly higher EPDM content (from10 to 15 wt%), and the impact strength is lowered down from 60 to 43 kJ/M 2 after the transition. Our interesting result comes when the impact strength is measured perpendicular to (parallel sample) and oblique with (oblique sample) the shear flow direction in two aspects: (1) a much higher impact strength is obtained, at the maximum, the impact strength of 80 KJ/m 2 is reached for parallel sample and 70 KJ/m 2 for oblique sample. (2) a definite B\u2013D transition was found at 10 wt% of EPDM for both parallel sample and oblique sample, and then a D\u2013B was seen at 30 wt% of EPDM for parallel sample and 25 wt% of EPDM for oblique sample. It should be noted that even for pure PP, the impact strength for parallel and oblique samples is higher than that for vertical sample due to the molecular orientation. So, not only the EPDM rubber particles but also the orientation of PP will contribute to the impact strength. However, if one compares the relative increase of impact strength, the B\u2013D transition or B\u2013D\u2013B transition is still obvious. 3.3 Phase morphology and the orientation of rubber particles To understand the observed B\u2013D transition in vertical samples and static samples, and B\u2013D\u2013B transition in parallel and oblique samples, we went to see the phase morphology of the blends. Let's take a look on the phase morphology of static sample first. The cross-section can be roughly divided into three regions, the skin, the middle layer and the core. The morphology from different regions of samples for PP/EPDM/80/20 blend is depicted in Fig. 5 and shown as an example. In the figure, the black holes represent EPDM particles, which have been dissolved out by toluene. It can be seen that in the skin, the dispersed rubber particles are highly elongated ( Fig. 5(a) ), due to the high shear rate from the nozzle during the injection molding. The elongated rubber particles were frozen very quickly with no time to recover back to their original shape. This result is similar to that obtained by J. Karger\u2013Kocsis's [11] . But for the middle layer and the core, because the dispersed particles has enough time to reach equilibrium state, the deformed particles resulting from the processing will become spherical in the mold, as shown in the Fig. 5(b) and (c) . For vertical samples obtained by dynamic injection molding, one also can observe three regions in the cross-section: the skin, the sheared layer and the core. The highest shear stress is expected in the skin and lowest is in the core. The morphology from the three regions of vertical sample for PP/EPDM/80/20 blend is shown in Fig. 6 for comparison with Fig. 5 . In skin, the morphology is similar to that of the static samples due to fast cooling of the surface. But in the sheared layer, the r elongated and highly oriented EPDM particles are observed. This is the result of particles orientation along the flow direction induced by shear stress during dynamic packing, and the deformed or elongated rubber particles could be fixed by the crystallization of PP during cooling, as suggested by Inoue after investigation of PP/HDPE blend [12] . In the core, because of the lowest shear stress and long time cooling, one observes less deformed and roughly spherical particles. Due to the heat released by the friction during shearing, a longer time is needed for cooling down the dynamic sample, which gives the sample more time to recover back to its original shape. The schematic representation of three-dimensional morphology of PP/EPDM, for both static and dynamic samples is shown in Fig. 7 , for comparison. So, the morphology difference between the static sample and the dynamic sample will be mainly in the region of sheared layer. Following, we will focus on the change of phase morphology in sheared layer as function of EPDM content. Fig. 8 shows the SEM photographs viewed perpendicular to the shear flow direction of PP/EPDM blends obtained via DPIM. Note, this direction is the same with fracture propagation direction for vertical sample. In all the compositions studied, the rubber particles are roughly spherical and the size is kept relatively constant (about 1.0 \u03bcm). This is in agreement with Borggreve's [13] and Tang's [14] results showing that the coalescence during blending of two polymer melts are prevented when there is sufficient interfacial adhesion between the dispersion and the matrix phase. Above, we see the B\u2013D transition for vertical sample in Fig. 4 , it seems that Wu's theory will hold true as long as the rubber particles are roughly spherical when viewed in the same direction with fracture propagation direction. The shift to a slight higher EPDM content at B\u2013D transition compared with static samples is probably due to the change of matrix toughness of PP caused by the molecular orientation in the shear stress, which may result in the change of critical matrix ligament thickness ( T c ). Fig. 9 shows the SEM photographs viewed along with the shear flow direction of PP/EPDM blends obtained via DPIM. Note this direction is perpendicular to the fracture propagation direction for parallel sample. At lower EPDM content (i.e. 10 wt%), most of rubber particles are spherical and a few particles are elliptical. The size is in the range of 0.3\u20131.0 \u03bcm, and not homogeneous. With the increasing EPDM content, more elongated and oriented rubber particles are observed. Especially, when the EPDM content reaches to 30 and 40 wt%, all the rubber particles are elongated and highly oriented along the shear flow direction, where one observes a D\u2013B transition in Fig. 4 . Here the result indicates once again that the Wu's criterion is no longer valid when dispersed rubber particles are elongated and oriented when viewed in the direction perpendicular to the fracture propagation direction. 3.4 The toughening mechanism According to Wu's theory, for given blends, T c is independent of the volume fractions and particle size of the rubber. If the neighboring particles are taken into account, the stress fields around individual particle are expected to interfere or overlap with each other and hence more massive shear yielding is expected to pervade the matrix as T is decreased. A percolation process of stress volume spheres has been successfully used to explain the phenomenon of the B\u2013D transition [15\u201317] . The theory, which has also created much controversy, has been further clarified by Muratoglu et al [18\u201320] , who have proposed that the incoherent particle-matrix interfaces stimulate a preferential form of crystallization over a definite distance around the particles with the lowest energy surfaces of crystalline lamellae representing also the crystallographic planes of lowest plastic resistance lying parallel to the interfaces. Above, we demonstrated the dependence of impact strength on the fracture propagation direction in oriented PP/EPDM blends. Wu's theory holds true as long as the rubber particles are roughly spherical when viewed in the same direction with fracture propagation direction, but no longer valid when dispersed rubber particles are elongated and oriented when viewed in the direction perpendicular to the fracture propagation direction. The relation between the rubber particle orientation and the fracture direction is schematically shown in Fig. 10 . For the parallel samples, the fracture propagation direction is perpendicular to the orientation direction of rubber particles and the matrix. Much energy is expected to break down the sample in the direction perpendicular to the orientation of rubber particles and the matrix. But for the vertical samples, the fracture propagation direction is along the orientation direction of rubber particles and the matrix. Because of the weak Van der waals force between the rubber particles and the matrix, the crack caused by impact force enlarges along the interface between the elongated rubber particles and the matrix, and results in a lower value of impact strength. For the oblique samples, the impact force can be divided into two parts. One is along the shear flow direction and the other is perpendicular to the flow direction. If we assume that only the force along the flow direction will cause sample fracture (it seems true because it is the weakest direction for a oriented sample), the fracture propagation direction will be along the flow direction and will be 45\u00b0 with the impact direction. This results in higher impact strength than that of vertical samples, but lower impact strength than that of parallel samples. We have indeed observed that the fracture of oblique samples is along the flow direction instead of impact direction for both tensile experiment and impact experiment, as schematically shown in Fig. 11 . Experimentally, one observes totally different fractured surfaces of samples fractured in three directions, which indicates different fracture mechanisms. Fig. 12 depicts the SEM photographs of impact-fractured surface of PP/EPDM=85/15, shown as an example. For vertical sample, a very smooth surface with many holes is seen, which is a typical morphology for brittle fracture ( Fig. 12(a) ). The holes are probably due to the detachment of rubber particles during the impact fracture. For oblique sample, a smooth surface with some yielding sheets is seen ( Fig. 12(b) ), which still suggests a brittle behavior. For parallel sample, however, one observes many thin and long strips which are parallel to each other and are homogeneously distributed ( Fig. 12(c) ), which suggests that the crack may start from one elongated particle but stop as it meets another elongated particle nearby, when the fracture propagation direction is perpendicular to the shear flow. The result indicates the development of crack is a layer-by-layer process by which a lot of impact energy is dissipated. Now the remaining question is that how can we understand the D\u2013B transition for parallel and oblique samples. From phase morphology, one observes a big change of rubber particles from roughly spherical shape to highly elongated and oriented at D\u2013B transition. Compared with the impact-fractured surface of the parallel samples between PP/EPDM=85/15 with 70/30 or 60/40, the difference is obvious, as shown in Fig. 13 , where the strips are connected for both samples due to the relatively high concentration of oriented and elongated rubber particles. Here all the strips are interfered or overlapped with each other and hence more massive fracture is expected to pervade the matrix, as the two strips are close enough. This may be the reason for D\u2013B transition. The finite element method (FEM) analysis showed that during impact fracture, dispersed particles acted as a stress concentrators to cause the three-dimensional stress concentration of matrix ligament around it. The stress concentration occurs not only in the equatorial (90\u00b0) but also in the polar (0\u00b0) and 45\u00b0 direction around the dispersed particle. It is concluded that the first stress and the equivalent stress become the dominating in rubber-toughened plastics, and they reach their maximum value at the equator region [21,22] . Obviously, the elongated rubber particles will cause a strong concentration of stress at the tip. Future work is needed to verify this expectation. Two other factor may also affect the impact strength: (1) the thickness of sheared layer, and (2) the crystal morphology of PP. For the thickness of sheared layer, we assume it is big enough to dominate the mechanical properties in our work. For the crystal morphology, it usually keeps unchanged under the same processing conditions and does not change much as increasing EPDM content. 4 Conclusion The dependence of impact strength of PP/EPDM blends on the fracture propagation direction in oriented samples obtained via DPIM was demonstrated in this work. A definite B\u2013D transition of impact strength was observed in vertical sample, where the fracture propagation direction is along shear flow direction; and a B\u2013D\u2013B transition was seen in parallel and oblique sample, where the fracture propagation direction is perpendicular to or oblique with the shear flow direction. Morphologically, one observes always roughly spherical rubber particles with constant size viewed perpendicular to the shear flow direction, and highly elongated and oriented rubber particles viewed along shear flow direction at higher EPDM content (more than 30 wt%). A very smooth fractured surface is observed when fracture propagation is along or oblique with the shear flow direction, but a lay-by-layer fracture behavior, when fracture propagation is perpendicular to the shear flow direction. It seems that Wu's theory holds true as long as the rubber particles are roughly spherical when viewed in the same direction with fracture propagation direction, but no longer valid when dispersed rubber particles are elongated and oriented when viewed in the direction perpendicular to or oblique with the fracture propagation direction.

However, little attention has been paid to the annealing of flow-oriented semicrystalline polymers despite its importance in polymer processing. In this work, the microstructural evolution of injection-moulded polypropylene with an oriented shish-kebab structure upon annealing has been explored with differential scanning calorimetry, small-angle X-ray scattering and scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and dynamic mechanical analysis. The results show that annealing gives rise to a chain rearrangement in both the crystalline and amorphous phases. Accompanied by the growth and perfecting of the kebabs, relaxation of the initially oriented chains in the amorphous phase is observed. Then, the relationship between the structure and the resulting mechanical properties is established. \u00a9 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.",

But little work has been done to systematically investigate the effect of shear on the structures and properties of long glass fiber reinforced thermoplastics. The purpose of this work is to investigate the effect of shear on fiber orientation, fiber breakage and matrix molecular orientation in long glass fiber reinforced polypropylene composites, and to construct the structure\u2013property relations. A so-called dynamic packing injection molding (DPIM) technique, which imposed oscillatory shear (10 s \u22121 ) on the gradually cooled melt during the packing solidification stage, was used to prepare the dynamic samples, and optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to characterize the samples. The results show that despite the well-published enhanced fiber and matrix orientation, shear will cause a remarkable fiber breakage. Combined effect of fiber breakage and orientation on the mechanical properties of the composites was qualitatively investigated and tensile properties of the dynamic samples, the conventional injection molded samples and the short glass fiber reinforced samples were compared. It is demonstrated that shear will induce more severe fiber breakage in long glass fiber reinforced polypropylene than in short glass fiber reinforced polypropylene, and that compromising the decreased strength caused by the severe fiber breakage is very difficult.",

        "abstract": "It is still a challenge to fabricate polymer-based composites with excellent thermal conductive property because of the well-known difficulties such as insufficient conductive pathways and inefficient filler-filler contact. To address this issue, a synergistic segregated double network by using two fillers with different dimensions has been designed and prepared by taking graphene nanoplates (GNPs) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) in polystyrene for example. In this structure, GNPs form the segregated network to largely increase the filler-filler contact areas while MWCNT are embedded within the network to improve the network-density. The segregated network and the randomly dispersed hybrid network by using GNPs and MWCNT together were also prepared for comparison. It was found that the thermal conductivity of segregated double network can achieve almost 1.8-fold as high as that of the randomly dispersed hybrid network, and 2.2-fold as that of the segregated network. Meanwhile, much higher synergistic efficiency (f) of 2 can be obtained, even greater than that of other synergistic systems reported previously. The excellent thermal conductive property and higher f are ascribed to the unique effect of segregated double network: (1) extensive GNPs-GNPs contact areas via overlapped interconnections within segregated GNPs network; (2) efficient synergistic effect between MWCNT network and GNPs network based on bridge effect as well as increasing the network-density.",

The all-cellulose composite filaments (CF) containing only 3 wt% NFC exhibits a high orientation that Herman's parameter is 0.89. Importantly, the NFC can simultaneously reinforce and toughen the CF, with a tensile strength and elongation at break of 3.92 cN/dT and 14.6%, respectively, which make the obtained CF to become super strong. The strengthened mechanism of CF is considered as the nano\ufb01bril-induced crystallization and orientation, which makes up for the deficits and constructs a flawless structure in the regenerated cellulose filaments. Of note, the stability of spinning dope was also effectively improved by adding small amount of NFC, which is very important for fiber spinning on industry. This finding contributes to the preparation of high performance regenerated cellulose multifilaments by a simple, energy-efficient, and eco-friendly route.",

        "abstract": "The dynamic percolation behavior of conductive fillers in conductive polymer composites (CPCs) has drawn wide interest due to its crucial influence on the final properties. It is thought that the viscosity of the neat polymer, filler\u2013polymer interaction and entanglement in the filler network are crucial issues. Meanwhile, the structure and related characteristics of the filler is an important parameter for determining filler properties and various functionalities. However, their influence on the filler dynamic self-assembly process in a polymer matrix has been barely investigated. Herein, three types of carbon black (CB) with different dibutyl phthalate (DBP) absorption have been used to study the electrical percolation behavior in thermoplastic polyurethane with methods including in situ electrical measurement during isothermal annealing, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and rheological study as well as theoretical analysis. It is observed that a higher DBP value leads to a lower percolation threshold. During dynamic percolation, the activation energy increases almost linearly with DBP absorption. It is thought that the more stable pre-formed conductive networks for CB with more DBP are responsible. Thus, the driving force for the self-assembly process is lower for CB with more DBP. This study provides new insight for the dynamic self-assembly process of a functional filler in a polymer matrix.",

The EG/polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) composite with a backbone of benzene rings shows the continuous highest thermal conductivity and the fastest rate of enhanced ratio at the same content. Then it is followed by EG/syndiotactic polystyrene (sPS) composites with side groups of regularly arranged benzene rings. The last are the EG/amorphous polystyrene (aPS) composites with side groups of randomly arranged benzene rings. Our results show that the chain structures of polymer matrices have a great influence on the interaction and crystallization of EG/polymer composites, which leads to the different thermal behavior. More precisely, the strong \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction between EG and polymer, the nucleation of crystal at the interface of EG/polymer and the relatively rich EG content in the amorphous phase are benefits to the enhancement of thermal conductivity. These factors are proved to be extremely important for the design of high thermally conductive composites in the fields of science and engineering.",

        "abstract": "In recent decades, great efforts have been devoted to prepare materials with enhanced thermal conductivity due to the growing interest in thermal conductive materials. Herein, we illustrate a facile strategy to improve the thermal conductivity of polyvinylidene fluoride/expanded graphite (PVDF/EG) composites by pre-treatment of EG via ball milling. Before incorporating EG into PVDF via conventional melt processing, EG powders were treated by shear-force-dominated ball milling. In this way, the loose and porous vermicular structure of EG could be effectively destroyed and exfoliated to graphite nanosheets (GNSs). As a result, the PVDF/GNSs composites show improved thermal conductivity owing to their larger specific surface area. With the filler content fixed at 15 wt%, the thermal conductivity of treated PVDF/GNSs composites can reach 1.29 W m\u22121 K\u22121, 42.5% higher than that of PVDF/EG (0.90 W m\u22121 K\u22121). Moreover, the electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding property and tensile strength of PVDF/CNSs composites are also remarkably improved. Our work proves to be a simple and easily industrialized method for EG treatment which has great potential for improving the thermal conductivity of polymer composites in lighting devices and electromagnetic shielding applications.",

It was also reported that combining electrically conductive fillers with different geometric shapes and aspect ratio together could enhance the electrical conductivity due to the synergistic effect. To further explore these two effects on the electrical property enhancement, we firstly encapsulated neat silica (SiO2) with graphene oxide (GO) through electrostatic self-assembly to render SiO2 with surface conductivity. Then neat SiO2 or SiO2@GO together with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) were mixed with polystyrene (PS) to prepare conductive composites. In this way, the volume exclusion effect in the PS/MWCNT/SiO2 system and combined effect of volume exclusion and synergy in the PS/MWCNT/SiO2@rGO system could be investigated and compared. An obvious increased conductivity was observed only in the transition composition region for the PS/MWCNT/SiO2 system compared with the PS/MWCNT system. However, a largely enhanced conductivity was achieved through the composition region for the PS/MWCNT/SiO2@rGO system compared with the PS/MWCNT/SiO2 system and PS/MWCNT, accompanied by great enhancement of the electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness. Given the SEM characterization and rheological properties, we attributed this obvious enhanced electrical property to both a volume exclusion effect and a synergistic effect.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Adding conductive filler is an effective way to enhance the dielectric constant while usually also increases the dielectric loss of polymer. In this study, we demonstrated that polymer composites with much improved dielectric constant while maintaining ultra-low dielectric loss could be achieved via using hybrid filler and controlling the dispersion of conductive filler in polymer matrix. To do this, the graphene oxide was designed to be immobilized on the surface of large-sized insulating hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) via electrostatic self-assembly, and afterwards introducing this hybrid filler into epoxy accompanied with chemical reduction. In this case, since the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets were fixed on the surface of h-BN, rGO sheets were well separated from each other even at high loading. Hence not only significantly enhanced dielectric constant was observed, but also a very low dielectric loss comparable to that of neat epoxy was achieved. This low dielectric loss was believed to be ascribed to both embedded insulating network of h-BN to inhibit the mobility of charge carrier and well-separated rGO sheets via immobilization. In addition to obviously improved dielectric properties, the nanocomposites also exhibited good thermal conductivity. We believe that this special structure will provide a new thought for fabricating dielectric materials with much enhanced dielectric constant as well as well-suppressed dielectric loss.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Melt blending is a promising and practical method to prepare electrical conductive polymer composites containing multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The key is to achieve a good dispersion of MWCNTs in polymer matrix. In this study, olefin block copolymer (OBC)/MWCNTs composites were prepared using co-rotating twin-screw extruder with high rotation speed and the influence of screw rotation speed on the dispersion, shortening of MWCNTs and the macro-properties of composites was systematically investigated. It was found that the entangled agglomerates of MWCNTs could be easily destroyed by using high rotation speed and an improved dispersion of MWCNTs was observed as increasing of rotation speed from 50 to 500\u00a0rpm. However, with further increasing of rotation speed from 500 to 1000\u00a0rpm, no better dispersion was evidenced but a reduction of nanotubes length was detected. As a result, the best electrical conductivity and mechanical properties of OBC/MWCNTs composites were achieved via using the rotation speed of 500\u00a0rpm. And the electrical percolation threshold obtained was about 1.5\u00a0wt%. This study provides significant guidance for large-scale preparation of conductive composites materials by using co-rotating twin-screw extruder with high rotation speed.",

        "abstract": "Graphene films receive tremendous attention due to their ultrahigh electrical and thermal conductivities, which show great application prospects in modern electronic devices. However, the brittleness and low strength of graphene films largely limit their use in advanced applications. And the preparation processes of graphene films reported so far are also not completely green. In this work, a novel strong and green graphene composite film with outstanding electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE), electrical and thermal conductivities was successfully fabricated by using nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) as dispersing agent and mechanical compression. In this way, graphene nanosheets (GNs) were not only efficiently dispersed in the aqueous solution but also linked together by NFC to enhance mechanical strength of the prepared films. Simultaneously, mechanical compression could powerfully induce strong alignment and increase the contact area of the GNs. As a result, the optimum electrical...",

        "abstract": "Dissolving cellulose rapidly at low temperature by using solvents (NaOH/urea, NaOH/thiourea, LiOH/urea or NaOH/thiourea/urea) opens a new chapter for the preparation of high-performance cellulose filaments for the unique structure containing nanofibers. In our previous work, it was found that the coagulation rate is a key to construct the nanofiber structure and thus to achieve high performance of regenerated cellulose filament (RCF) via wet-spinning. In this work, phytic acid salt was used to further adjust the coagulation rate for a better control of the structure of RCF. It was found that adding a small amount of salt would promote a rapid diffusion of phytic acid from the skin to the core of cellulose filament, resulting in a relatively compacted structure accompanying an increasing skin yet decreasing core. However, excessive salt would result in a decrease of neutralization capability of phytic acid, leading to a less compacted structure in the filament. The optimum salt concentration was found to b...",

However, the mechanical brittleness is the major limitation for their applications. To meet this challenge, in this work, a small amount of flexible graphene (GE) is introduced to endow EG films with good flexibility and mechanical properties by forming simulate shell structure. Moreover, the influence of oxidation degree and sheet thickness for carbon sheets as well as the lateral size of GE on the film performance is carefully discussed. As a result, a 431% enhancement of tensile strength from 7.7 Mpa to 40.9 Mpa and little sacrifice of electric, thermal conductivities up to 1467\u202fS\u202fcm \u22121  and 348\u202fW\u202fm \u22121 \u202fK \u22121  are observed with the loading of only 10% large GE (LGE) sheets in EG films. Besides, high EMI shielding of 48.3\u202fdB is achieved as the film thickness reaches 43\u202f\u03bcm. The excellent flexibility of prepared EG/LGE films can be retained even after more than 1000 times of direct folding. These excellent properties of light-weight EG/LGE films, together with their advantages of environmentally friendly and facile large-scale fabrication, endow the films with great potential applications in next-generation commercial portable flexible electronics.",

        "abstract": "Adding functional fillers is a simple but efficient way to improve the dielectric properties of polymer materials. However, the improvement of dielectric constant is usually accompanied by a decrease of breakdown strength (BDS), and vice versa, which results in only a limited increase of the energy storage density of polymer composites. In this work, boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs), an insulator with high theoretical BDS (800 kV mm\u22121), were used to improve the dielectric properties of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). To improve the dispersion of BNNSs and the interfacial interaction with the PVDF matrix, the grafting of hydroxyl groups onto the surface of BNNSs was first carried out to obtain surface modified BNNSs (OH-BNNSs). Interestingly, the surface hydroxylation of BNNSs could realize simultaneous enhancement both in BDS and dielectric constant. Therefore, a high energy storage density of 13.1 J cm\u22123 has been achieved for PVDF/OH-BNNS nanocomposites with only 6 wt% filler content, which represents an impressive enhancement compared with neat PVDF (440%) or PVDF/BNNS (166%) nanocomposites. Moreover, decreased dielectric loss tangent, and improved thermal and mechanical properties of PVDF have also been achieved by adding OH-BNNSs. This research provides a new dimension of the surface modification of BNNSs and broadens their practical applications in the field of dielectric energy storage.",

        "title": "Mechanical properties of polypropylene composites reinforced by hydrolyzed and microfibrillated Kevlar fibers",
        "abstract": "Abstract   As a traditional general plastic, polypropylene (PP) has been widely used in daily life. Glass fibers are often used to further reinforce the properties of PP for its application in engineering area. However, there are still some drawbacks existing for glass fibers filled polypropylene composites, such as high filler content, easy fracture of glass fibers and damage to the machines during processing. Therefore, organic fibers are considered as an ideal candidate to replace glass fibers. In this work, short Kevlar fibers (KFs) modified by ball milling in phosphoric acid and surface hydrolyzation were introduced to PP matrix to improve the interfacial interaction and mechanical properties. It is found that KFs were exfoliated into several flaky microfibers and then broken into pieces during the ball milling process. With the aid of phosphoric acid, the KFs can be split further thereby increasing specific surface area greatly. Then the original and milled KFs were hydrolyzed by NaOH aqueous solution in order to introduce OH group on the surface of KFs. The dispersion and mechanical properties of PP reinforced with various KFs, including original, ball milled, and hydrolyzed, were investigated and compared. It was found that the combination of ball milling in phosphoric acid and surface hydrolyzation is the most effective way for enhancement of interfacial reaction and mechanical properties. Adding 10\u202fwt. % of KFs could lead to an increase of tensile strength of PP from 30\u202fMPa to 47\u202fMPa, which only can be achieved by adding at least of 25\u202fwt. % of glass fibers. The tensile test shows that hydrolyze of KFs surface are a more important factor to promote the interfacial interaction between fibers and matrix. Our work demonstrates that PP can be enhanced efficiently by the introduction of hydrolyzed and microfibrillated KFs. Although KFs are expensive compared with glass fiber at this moment, their high reinforcement efficiency and toughness could make them competitive as reinforcing filler for the preparation of advanced polymer composites with excellent mechanical and processing properties.",

        "abstract": "Chemical modification of boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) is a simple but effective method to improve their dispersion and compatibility within polymer nanocomposites. The key point is how to import compatible functional groups but simultaneously retain the intact crystal lattice. In this study, two different hydroxylation methods, namely nitric acid oxidation and aqueous ball milling, were adopted for surface modification of BNNSs. And a comparative study was carried out in terms of hydroxyl (OH) content, position of modification and the thermal conductivity (TC) after mixing them with a biodegradable cellulose nanofiber (CNF). TEM mapping, XRD and HRTEM indicated that nitric acid oxidation mainly resulted in an in-plane hydroxylation of BNNSs (POH-BNNSs) whose crystal lattice was seriously damaged, while aqueous ball milling led to most likely an edge hydroxylation of BNNSs (EOH-BNNSs) whose crystal lattice could be well preserved. As a result, strikingly, the TC of POH-BNNS filled nanocomposites only showed a little growth (10.2%) at a low OH content or even decreased at a higher OH loading, while an impressive thermal enhancement of almost 100% was achieved for CNF/EOH-BNNS nanocomposites. Such a substantial improvement signifies the critical role of edge-hydroxylation, which can simultaneously reduce interfacial thermal resistance and retain the intact basal crystal lattice to facilitate acoustic phonon transfer. This research provides deep insight into modification of two-dimensional nanomaterials from the point of view of the defect position, and an edge-selective modification strategy is expected to be of great advantage for the fabrication of highly thermally conductive nanocomposites.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Electrospun nanofiber is regarded as a promising candidate for many high-end applications due to its advantageous unique structure. Ultrafine fiber and good mechanical property are essential to ensure its performance. In this work, tunable ultrafine diameter and significantly enhanced mechanical strength of electrospun Styrene-butadiene-styrene tri-block copolymer (SBS) membrane are attained by means of the addition of LiBr into SBS solution dissolved in tetrahydrofuran/dimethylformamide (THF/DMF). Solution conductivity is found to grow in two steps with the increasing lithium bromide (LiBr) concentration and a critical point is observed at the ultralow concentration of 0.005\u202fwt%, sharp increase below it but modest increase above it. Interestingly, the diameter of electrospun fiber shows a significant reduction with increase of LiBr concentration below this critical point but minor fluctuation above this. Welded structure is observed between adjacent fibers and the degree of welding goes deeper with increase of salt concentration. Accordingly, the mechanical strength of electrospun membrane is gradually enhanced and reaches to the highest value of 5.7\u202fMPa\u202fat the critical concentration, with enhancement of 134% in comparison with pure electrospun SBS membrane, and then declines when further adding LiBr. TEM observation confirms more oriented and distinct self-assembly domains in the finer fibers, which contribute greatly to the property enhancement for electrospun SBS membrane obtained below critical concentration. The finding of critical concentration is important for the preparation of high performance electrospun membrane by adding salt in the spinning solution.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Expanded graphite (EG) films are known for high electric and thermal transportation properties, due to light oxidation preparation process compared with chemical converted graphene (cGE) films. However, the poor mechanical properties and brittle nature are the major limitations for commercial applications. To meet this challenge, in this work, hydrated aramid nanofiber (HANF) with excellent mechanical properties and flexibility is introduced into EG films to enhance their mechanical properties and flexibility. As a result, only the adding of 2\u202fwt% HANF can endow EG films with good flexibility. The best comprehensive property is achieved by adding 10% HANF (EG-10). Compared with the pure EG films (EG-0), a 223% improvement of tensile strength from 7.5\u202fMpa to 24.2\u202fMpa and a 660% enhancement of elongation at break from 0.371% to 2.82% are observed for EG-10. Besides, EG-10 maintains good electric and thermal conductivities of 215\u202fS\u202fcm \u22121 , 208\u202fW\u202fm \u22121 \u202fK \u22121 . Moreover, the EMI shielding property of 34.9\u202fdB is realized when the film thickness reaches only 30\u202f\u03bcm. The EG/HANF films can be used up to the temperature of 300\u202f\u00b0C and show good flame resistance compared with adding other polymers thanks to the good stability of HANF. And, the excellent flexibility can be maintained even after 1000 times direct folding. The comprehensive properties of light weight films, together with their advantages of simple, cheap and facile large-scale preparation process endow the films with promising applications in next generation foldable electronic devices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, the crystalline morphology and mechanical property of Olefin Block Copolymer (OBC) were tailored by adding a small amount (up to 10\u00a0wt%) of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). To do this, OBC and UHMWPE was solution blended first and then subjected to compression molding or injection molding, respectively. It was found that a small quantity of UHMWPE (0.5\u00a0wt%, 1\u00a0wt%) can be fully mixed with OBC, while phase separation occurs when UHMWPE content is higher than 2.5\u00a0wt%, as suggested by SEM and DSC results. For compression molded samples, an obvious increase of Youngu0027s modulus from 12\u00a0MPa to 22\u00a0MPa while maintaining the good elasticity of OBC was observed as the content of UHMWPE is less than 2.5\u00a0wt% (in the phase miscible range). With further increasing of UHMWPE content to 10\u00a0wt%, only slightly increased Youngu0027s modulus is seen. Thus the miscibility between OBC and UHMWPE plays an important role in determining the mechanical property for compression molded samples. However, a continuous increase of Youngu0027s modulus was observed with the increase of UHMWPE content for samples obtained via injection molding, with a slight increase (from 23\u00a0MPa to 40\u00a0MPa) as the content of UHMWPE is less than 2.5\u00a0wt%, while with a large increase (from 40\u00a0MPa to 156\u00a0MPa) as the content of UHMWPE increases from 2.5\u00a0wt% to 10\u00a0wt%, accompanied with a greatly decrease of elongation (from 1100% to 50%). Even elastomer-to-plastic transition takes place when the content of UHMWPE is large (5\u00a0wt%, 10\u00a0wt%). Structural analysis of injection-molded samples shows that shish-kebab-like structures can be successfully induced as addition of UHMWPE along with gradually increased crystal orientation. It was interesting to find that small-addition of UHMWPE favors increased tie-effect due to the miscibility between OBC and UHMWPE, which is helpful to the elasticity retaining as well as strength enhancement, while large-addition of UHMWPE gives rise to phase separation and mixed shish-kebabs (OBC/UHMWPE hybrid shish-kebabs and UHMWPE homo-shish-kebabs), leading to elastomer-to-plastic transition.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   With the rapid development of high performance capacitors for energy storage, materials with both giant dielectric constant and low dielectric loss are urgently needed. Adding conductive filler could largely enhance the dielectric constant of polymer matrix but also greatly increase the dielectric loss. In this study, we provide a new strategy by using hybrid fillers to construct a segregated double network, where conductive multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) network is wrapped by insulating hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) network to destroy the continuity of embedded MWCNT network. To do this, pre-fabricated micron-sized PS/MWCNT particles were completely coated by h-BN through \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction. As a result, the MWCNT network inside h-BN network provides good conductivity while h-BN network provides the isolation effect but do not increase the distance between two adjacent MWCNT agglomerations, which together can maintain the high dielectric constant and decrease the dielectric loss. Therefore, a high dielectric constant of 123 is achieved while a relatively low dielectric loss is also kept as 0.36. More importantly, this special structure of segregated double network also leads to obviously enhanced thermal conductivity which is 2.23-fold of that of the composites with randomly dispersed hybrid fillers. This high thermal conductivity is ascribed to the high synergistic efficiency between segregated h-BN network and dense MWCNT network. We believe that these good comprehensive performances promise this structure to offer a unique and effective way to prepare high-performance dielectric materials with not only high dielectric constant and low dielectric loss, but also good capability of heat dissipation.",

        "abstract": "Despite the good biodegradable and mechanical properties, poly(lactic acid) still suffers from a highly inherent flammability, which restricts its applications in the electric and automobile fields. In order to improve the flame retardancy of PLA, in this work, melamine polyphosphate (MPP) and zinc bisdiethylphosphinate (ZnPi) were firstly incorporated into PLA, and the synergistic effect of them on flame retardance of PLA was investigated using limiting oxygen index (LOI), UL-94 vertical measurement, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cone calorimeter tests etc. The results showed that PLA composite with 15 wt% of MPP/ZnPi (3:2) had the best flame-retardant efficiency with LOI value of 30.1 and V0 rating in UL-94 tests, which was far better than using MPP or ZnPi alone. What is more, although a wide range of flame retardants have been developed to reduce the flammability, so far, they normally compromise the mechanical properties of PLA. On the premise of maintaining good flame-retardant performance, we improved the toughness of flame-retardant PLA composite, and the impact strength of flame-retardant PLA composite was more than tripled (8.08 kJ/m2) by adding thermoplastic urethanes (TPU). This work offers an innovative method for the design of the unique integration of extraordinary flame retardancy and toughening reinforcement for PLA materials.",

It was found that the domain sizes of the dispersed PMMA phase decrease in PS matrix, and tensile strength and elongation of PS/PMMA blends were largely enhanced by adding a small amount of JPC. More importantly, both interfacial tension analyses and elemental Si distribution in the blends suggest a possible location of the JPC at the PS/PMMA interfaces. Our studies provide not only a new idea for the compatibilization of polymer blends, but also for precisely controlling the positions of nanoparticles in a polymer matrix, which is also of great importance for the preparation of polymer nanocomposites with high-performance and excellent functionality.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, we report a sharp increase of both thermal and electrical conductivity in polypropylene (PP) via formation of double percolated filler network with dense small-sized multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) network located within loosened large-sized expanded graphite (EG) network. The electrical conductivity of PP/EG composites which levels off after the percolation threshold can be further enhanced by adding MWCNT and is increased two orders of magnitude as the content of MWCNT reaches to its threshold. Besides, the thermal conductivity of PP/EG-MWCNT increases by 38.5% compared to PP/EG and is much higher than PP/MWCNT. Furthermore, an excellent electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness of \u223c60\u00a0dB is obtained at the sample thickness of only 1.3\u00a0mm. Then, effective medium theory model is applied to analyze the mechanism for the largely enhanced thermal and electrical conductivity. It is suggested that formation of double percolated filler network, in which three types of connections exist between EG and EG, EG and MWCNT as well as MWCNT and MWCNT, could effectively reduce the interface thermal resistance. Our work is important and provides some new idea for the preparation of polymer composites with excellent thermal and electrical conductivity via constructing double percolated filler network.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The morphology and lamellar orientations in the thin blend films (\u223c30\u00a0nm) of poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) and different molar mass of polystyrene(PS) were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The influence of PS molar mass on the PCL crystal structures was studied. The results show that both fibrous edge-on and flat-on microcrystal can be obtained when low molar mass PS (LPS with M  w  \u00a0=\u00a03.7k and 7.5k) is added into the thin PCL films, while only flat-on crystal is constructed for the films blending with high molar mass PS (HPS with M  w  \u00a0=\u00a015.5k and 54k and 106k). The different crystal morphology formation is explained based on the competition between phase separation and crystallization. For the LPS/PCL blend films, it is the homogeneous nucleation crystallization of PCL at the films surface that leads to the formation of fibrous edge-on together with several isolated and faceted flat-on crystals. While for the HPS/PCL blend films, it is the first vertical phase separation followed by the heterogeneous nucleation of PCL at polymer/substrate interface process that results in the morphology of flat-on PCL crystal decorated by PS domain island or dewetting hollows on the top.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Extensive efforts have been devoted to utilize cellulose fibers as reinforcement for poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) to prepare fully biodegradable composites with enhanced mechanical properties, but unfortunately the improvement of strength is always at the sacrifice of toughness. In the current work, we have developed an efficient way to prepare poly(e-caprolactone)/functionalized cellulose nanofibers (PCL/ f -NFC) nanocomposite, which is both strong and ductile. Large scale  f -NFC was produced from microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) in one step through the synergy of mechanical and chemical actions derived from ball milling. The  f -NFC with nanosized scale and tailored hydrophobicity is compatible with PCL, which leads to strong interfacial interaction between  f -NFC and PCL and good dispersion of  f -NFC in PCL. The tensile strength of this bionanocomposite undergoes a remarkable enhancement nearly 100% and elongation-at-break increases by 68% with extremely low  f -NFC content as 0.1\u00a0wt%. Since both surface property and fiber size affect the performance of composites, original MFC, functionalized MFC ( f- MFC) and cellulose nanofibers (NFC) without hydrophobic modification are also incorporated into PCL to make a systematic comparative study to identify the dominating factor influencing the performance. The overall results suggest that surface modification plays a dominant role at low fiber content, while nano-sized scale is much more beneficial at high fiber content. Most importantly, the synergistic effect of surface modification and nano-sized scale leads to significantly improved tensile properties across a wide range of fiber content.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The production of large graphene oxide (GO) sheets is often limited by the huge diffusion resistance for oxidizing agents caused by the structural uniformity of large raw graphite flakes. Previous methods often rely on the thermal or microwave, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) expansion to overcome the large diffusion resistance. However, the pretreatment is usually energy consuming and costs extra acid which may cause more environmental risks. Here, we discovered that adding ammonium persulfate ((NH 4 ) 2 S 2 O 8 ) to concentrated sulfuric acid as gas expansion agent for the pretreatment of graphite flakes can lead the graphite to form a porous structure and effectively improve the specific surface area of graphite, providing more contact area for graphite with oxidizing agents due to the rapid gas release. Thus, the diffusion resistance for oxidizing agents is remarkably reduced. As a result, graphite oxide with pretreatment shows higher oxidation degree (C/O ratio: 1.7) compared with graphite oxide without pretreatment (C/O ratio: 2.3). Besides, without any exfoliation method, the as obtained uniformly oxidized graphite oxide can self-exfoliate into monolayer GO sheets with a weight average size of 1263\u202f\u03bcm 2 . Moreover, the vacuum filtrated GO films exhibit superior mechanical properties (Tensile strength: 80.9\u202fMPa).",

        "abstract": "Boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) are ideal candidates to endow polymers with high breakdown strength (Eb) and energy storage density (Ue). Surface modifications, including non-covalent or covalently bonding, are adopted to improve their dispersion in polymer matrix, but, usually, they suffer from inferior dielectric properties. The key is to improve their compatibility within polymer without sacrificing excellent dielectric properties, which remains to be a great challenge. In this study, three methods were designed to modify BNNSs within poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) for a comparative study. The first one involves a non-covalent polydopamine (PDA) coating (PDA-BNNSs); the crystal lattice was well-preserved, but additional PDA was introduced. The second method involves basal hydroxylation via nitric acid (HNO3) oxidation (BOH-BNNSs) with hydroxyl groups (\u2013OH) mainly located at the basal plane, thus, seriously damaging the in-plane crystal. The third one is edge-hydroxylation via ball-milling (EOH-BNNSs) with \u2013OH groups being regulated at the boundary; thus, integrated basal crystal is largely maintained. It was very interesting to find that the dispersion, interfacial interaction and orientation of BNNSs in PVDF matrix are more or less similar for all three surface-modification methods, but the enhancement of Eb is very different. PDA-BNNS and BOH-BNNS filled PVDF nanocomposites exhibited a limited enhancement of Eb, while a greatly improved Eb (\u223c146.6%) was observed for EOH-BNNS filled PVDF nanocomposites in comparison with that of PVDF/BNNSs nanocomposites. Therefore, edge-hydroxylation could endow PVDF/EOH-BNNS nanocomposites with impressive Eb (585 kV mm\u22121) and Ue (16.23 J cm\u22123). Because the low Eb of PDA and the decreased band gap energy (Eg) of BOH-BNNSs (2.73 eV) are both disadvantages for achievement of high Eb. Inversely, well-preserved basal crystal lattices could be obtained if \u2013OH groups are regulated at the boundary, which makes EOH-BNNSs not only display better dispersion and interfacial interaction but also retain higher Eg (5.76 eV). This study demonstrates the importance of maintaining an integrated crystal lattice of BNNSs when exposed to surface modification for the first time. Our study provides guidance for surface-modification of BNNSs and preparation of polymer-based capacitors with excellent performance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Thermally conductive but electrically insulating polymer composites have drawn much attention in various applications including thermal management, electronic packing, etc. Herein, a facile method of preparing polymer composites with both excellent thermal conductivity and electrical insulation is reported. To do this, nylon 6 (PA6)/Graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) composites were firstly prepared via melt blending, then smashed into micron particles and coated with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) powder via VAE resin, finally hot compress molding to form composites. Thus depending on the content of GNPs inside PA6 particles and the content of h-BN coated on the particles, the thermal and electrical conductivity of the composites could be well controlled. For instance, at the total content of fillers is 18.82\u202fvol%, with 1.97\u202fvol% GNPs insides PA particles and 16.85\u202fvol% h-BN coated on the surface, almost ten times improvement of thermal conductivity (from 0.29 to 2.69\u202fW\u202fm \u22121 k \u22121 ) has been achieved, while still maintain an excellent electrical insulating (as low as 4.13\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 \u22129 \u202fS/m). It is proposed that this double segregated filler network could provide synergistic enhancement for the thermal conductivity, while the electrical conductivity caused by GNPs could be largely cut off by h-BN filler network. More importantly, this unique structure could be well preserved even after the sample thickness was decreased into a thin film, resulting in a further increase of thermal conductivity (up to 8.96\u202fW\u202fm \u22121 k \u22121 ) in the flow direction. Since various thermoplastic polymers can be chosen as matrix, and different filler combination can be adopted to construct thermal conductive synergistic and electrical insulating, we believe that this work provides a facial method to fabricate highly thermally conductive composites with a low electrical conductivity.",

Subsequently, cellulose/chitosan composite (CLS) fibers were spun successfully from the mixture solution on a lab-scale spinning machine. The CLS fibers exhibited good mechanical properties with tensile strength of 3.2 cN/dtex in the dry state and 2.9 cN/dtex in the wet state, as a result of the combination of good miscibility between two components and their nanofiber self-assembly driven by self-aggregation force through hydrogen bonding interactions.

        "abstract": "Despite its attractiveness as an \u201cgreen\u201d substitute for conventional petroleum-based polymers, the current application of plant-derived biodegradable poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) in many fields has been greatly limited by its inherent brittleness and poor heat resistance. Herein, taking thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) toughened PLLA as an example, we report a facile and promising strategy for the fabrication of super-toughened and heat-resistant PLLA/elastomer blends by incorporating small amounts (e.g., 2.5 wt%) of poly(D-lactide) (PDLA) into the blends through melt-blending and subsequent injection molding. The incorporated PDLA chains can readily collaborate with neighboring PLLA matrix chains during the melt-blending process to co-crystallize into stereocomplex (sc) crystallites in the PLLA matrix of the blend melts. Thus, these sc crystallites can behave as a highly efficient nucleating agent to significantly accelerate matrix crystallization, allowing for the preparation of PLLA blends with a highly crystallized PLLA matrix using practical injection molding. The highly crystallized matrix can provide the PLLA/TPU blends with dramatically improved impact toughness and heat resistance as compared with the amorphous one. Meanwhile, the role of these sc crystallites as a rheology modifier to induce the unexpected morphological change from the dispersed TPU phase from the sea-island structure to the unique network-like structure with a much higher toughening efficiency is also observed.",

But the interplay between them is far from being well understood. Here, glass fiber was incorporated into polypropylene to promote extrinsic toughening mechanism, while addition of elastomer and annealing were adopted for intrinsic toughening. In this way, the interaction among glass fiber, elastomer and annealing could be discussed based on various characterizations, and their combined effect on mechanical properties of the composites could be determined. The results show that the intrinsic toughening mechanism of elastomer will be suppressed by glass fiber irrespective of the support of annealing, though annealing could work synergistically with glass fiber to toughen polypropylene. The possible structure-property relations are discussed. This work will provide deeper insight into the toughening behavior of polymer composites and practical guidance for the design of composites with excellent stiffness-toughness balance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Bio-degradable polylactide (PLA) based composites has attracted much attention both in academic research and industrial applications in recent decades due to the increasing environmental concerns. In this work, we tried to obtain PLA based composites with good stiffness-toughness balanced properties by adjusting carbon fiber (CF) network in polylactide (PLA) matrix via adding a small amount of soft poly(ether)urethane (PU). It was interesting to find that PU could serve as \u201csolder\u201d to weld CF into a more perfect network due to the fact that PU has stronger interaction with CF as compared with PLA and improve the interface interaction between CF and PLA meanwhile. The self-weld CF network structure was confirmed by SEM characterizations, rheology and conductivity tests. More importantly, the formation of self-weld network structure constructed by both stiff CF and ductile PU elastomer can simultaneously improve tensile strength, impact toughness and even electrical conductivity of PLA. This inspiring result demonstrates that the addition of soft elastomer which has a strong interaction with fiber into fiber-reinforced polymers could be a universal platform to improve the performance of polymer composites via tuning fibers network and the interfacial interaction between fibers and polymer matrix.",

The results manifest that the introduced PDLA chains can readily interact with PLLA matrix chains and rapidly cocrystallize into stereocomplex (sc) crystallites capable of acting as an efficient rheology modifier to dramatically improve melt viscoelasticity of the PLLA matrix and subsequently induce the morphological change of the dispersed TPU phase from a typical sea\u2013island structure to a unique networklike structure, thus endowing PLLA/TPU/PDLA blends with remarkably improved...",

        "abstract": "How reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and graphene oxide (GO) affect the performance of chitosan (CS) nanocomposites is discussed in this paper. A special two-step reduction method was used to prepare the CS\u2013rGO nanocomposite films, firstly, the CS\u2013GO nanocomposite films were prepared by the solution casting method, and secondly, the prepared CS\u2013GO films were immersed into a reducing agent aqueous solution in which the reducing agents could diffuse onto the surface of the GO sheets and then reduce them. So this method could avoid the phenomena of aggregation, morphology change and rearrangement of the GO sheets, which would happen if they are directly reduced in the CS\u2013GO solution with or without a surfactant. The results show that the loading of the two kinds of fillers can enhance the tensile strength of the nanocomposites, but the mechanism is different, one reason is due to the strong interfacial interaction between GO and CS, and another one may be due to the high mechanical strength of rGO and the recrystallization of the CS matrix during the reduction process. This work provides a new way to analyze the interfacial interaction between the filler and CS matrix, and also could be used in other polymer systems to find the essential mechanism of how the filler could affect on the mechanical properties of nanocomposites.",

A simple method based on high speed thin-wall injection molding (HSTWIM) has been proposed in our previous studies for the easy fabrication of multi-layer functional polymeric materials. Herein, the effect of various injection processing parameters: injection distance, injection speed, mold temperature and mold thickness on the phase morphology and molecular orientation is studied. The processing condition induced changes in flow field, temperature field, viscosity and shear time are thought to largely influence the confinement of melt during processing, thus, their final phase morphology. It is observed that moderate injection distance, moderate injection speed, moderate mold temperature and thin mold favors the formation of such alternating multi-layer structure. Such study could provide guidelines for the fabrication of functional multi-layered structure through HSTWIM as well as control of phase morphology through confined flow.",

However, the commercial adoption of PLLA textile fibers still faces some hurdles mainly associated with their poor heat resistance (i.e., high thermal shrinkage or low dimensional stability) because the low crystallization rate makes PLLA difficult to crystallize during melt spinning. Herein, we report a simple but robust strategy to address this hurdle via simultaneously manipulating crystallinity and lamellae orientation with the aid of a highly active nucleating agent (NA) that can be completely dissolved in PLLA melt and reorganize into fine fibrils upon cooling.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Selective localization of nanoparticles at the interface of immiscible polymer blends has been witnessed as an efficient method to improve blend properties and even provide some added functionalities. Nevertheless, it is still a great challenge to achieve thermodynamically stable interface-localization of the nanoparticles mainly due to their low interfacial stabilities as well as high transfer speeds between the blend phases, especially for those with high aspect ratios. In this work, taking poly( l -lactide)/poly( d -lactide) grafted ethylene-acrylic ester copolymer/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (PLLA/EGD/MWCNTs) ternary composite as an example, we describe a new and facile strategy to address this challenge via anchoring high-aspect-ratio MWCNTs at the interface of PLLA/EGD blends using interface-localized stereocomplex (SC) crystallites as anchoring agents. During melt mixing of EGD with PLLA/MWCNTs mixture, such SC crystallites can be rapidly formed at the blend interface to prevent MWCNTs transferring from the thermodynamically unfavorable PLLA matrix into favorable EGD phase as physical barriers, and meanwhile some of these transferring MWCNTs could serve as nucleating agents to induce SC crystallization on their surfaces. As a result, many MWCNTs are firmly anchored at the blend interface by these SC crystallites. The anchored MWCNTs can not only function as effective interfacial enhancers to remarkably enhance interfacial strength and resulting impact toughness of PLLA/EGD blends but also enable the formation of electrical conductive pathway in the network-like PLLA/EGD blends at a much lower percolation threshold. This wok could offer a promising opportunity for preparing high-performance and multifunctional PLLA-based composites through controlling particle localization at the interface of immiscible PLLA blends with the aid of SC crystallization.",

        "abstract": "Selective localization of conductive nanofillers in one phase of co-continuous polymer blends provides an efficient method to greatly reduce the electrical percolation threshold of conductive polymer composites. However, it is still a big challenge to achieve very low percolation thresholds because the critical content for the complete continuity of the selectively filled phase is generally high. In this contribution, taking poly(L-lactide)/thermoplastic polyurethane/carbon nanotubes (PLLA/TPU/CNTs) composite as an example, we demonstrate a facile and versatile strategy for the fabrication of highly conductive PLLA-based composites with very low percolation threshold as well as excellent stiffness\u2013toughness balance via constructing stereocomplex (SC) crystallites in PLLA melt to effectively tailor the phase transition behavior of the blend matrices. To do this, small amounts of poly(D-lactide) (PDLA) capable of co-crystallizing with the PLLA chains to form SC crystallites were incorporated into the composites by melt mixing at 190 \u00b0C. These SC crystallites can serve as physical cross-linking points to significantly increase PLLA melt-viscosity and subsequently induce the formation of co-continuous structure in the PLLA/TPU blend matrix at a much lower content of the CNTs-filled TPU phase. As a result, the obtained composites not only show a dramatically reduced percolation threshold (0.3 wt%) but also exhibit a balanced impact toughness and mechanical strength. Importantly, the strategy to promote the complete continuity of the CNTs-filled phase in blend matrix is low-cost and scalable, opening up a new avenue for the design and engineering of highly conductive PLLA-based composites.",

It was observed that TiO 2  nanoparticels are selectively located at the interface between PU dispersed phase and PLA matrix to form a so called soft core-rigid shell structure. Interestingly, the addition of PU gives a significant rise to not only toughness, but also UV-resistance of PLA/TiO 2  composites. According to Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), the anhydride as the main photoproducts was confirmed for all the prepared samples, including PLA, PLA/PU blends, PLA/TiO 2  and (PLA/TiO 2 )PU nanocomposites, which indicates that the addition of PU or/and TiO 2  does not alter the photooxidation chemical mechanism of PLA.

However, it remains a challenge to fabricate electrospun sc-PLA membranes with sufficient mechanical strength and structural integrity for practical applications due to the weak adhesion between fibers. Herein, we devise a new low-temperature sintering mechanism that leads to substantially improved inter-fiber adhesion and the resultant membrane performance. We find that sintering below the melting temperature of sc crystallites can induce the interdiffusion of PLLA/PDLA chain segments from adjacent sc-PLA fibers across the intersections, which subsequently co-crystallize into new sc crystallites capable of tightly welding these fibers together. As a result, the tensile strength and Youngu0027s modulus of the electrospun membranes are significantly enhanced from 0.9 MPa and 23.7 MPa to 11.1 MPa and 546.2 MPa, respectively. Critically, the mechanical enhancement is achieved without changing the original porous structure of the electrospun membranes, which is distinctly different from the destroyed membrane structure obtained by conventional thermal annealing at a temperature near the melting temperature of sc crystallites. We further demonstrate that the sintered membranes have excellent chloroform/water separation ability without being destroyed or even swollen. Our overall findings suggest a highly effective approach to fabricate PLA nanofibrous membranes with superior mechanical strength and unprecedented separation performance through interfacial stereocomplex crystallization.",

        "abstract": "Stereocomplex (SC) crystallization between high-molecular-weight poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) and poly(d-lactide) (PDLA) provides a promising route to substantially improve the properties of polylactide (PLA), but conventional melt processing of the SC-type PLA (SC-PLA) is nearly impossible primarily due to the poor crystallization memory effect as well as serious thermal degradation after complete melting of SC crystallites with high melting temperatures of above 220 \u00b0C. Recently, we reported an innovative low-temperature (180\u2013210 \u00b0C) sintering technology for fabricating SC-PLA products from its nascent powder. Unfortunately, its practical application has been significantly hindered by an extremely high pressure of 1 GPa, which must be utilized to ensure good surface wetting of the densified powder particles. With this challenge in mind, herein, the role of powder crystallinity in the low-temperature sintering has been investigated.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Recently, we proposed a novel strategy for fabricating high-performance stereocomplex-type polylactide (SC-PLA) products through low-temperature (180\u2013210\u202f\u00b0C, lower than the melting temperature of SC crystallites) sintering from its nascent powder, without serious thermal degradation involved in the conventional melt processing at higher temperatures. During the sintering, some poly( l -lactide) (PLLA) and poly( d -lactide) (PDLA) chains from adjacent powdery particles can interdiffuse across the interfaces and subsequently co-crystallize into new SC crystallites capable of welding the interfaces. The interfacial strength is dominated by the content of the newly-formed SC crystallites, however, the fast cocrystallization of PLLA/PDLA chains could hinder their sufficient interdiffusion at the interfaces and thus only limited interface-localized SC crystallites could be formed. In this work, we attempt to substantially promote the chain interdiffusion via depressing the cocrystallization rate. To do this, SC-PLA nascent powders with different optical purities of the lactate units were prepared, and the role of optical purity in directing the chain interdiffusion and cocrystallization has been investigated. Very interestingly, we demonstrate that decreasing optical purity (from 99.5 to 96%) is favorable for the formation of numerous SC crystallites at the interfaces because the lowering of cocrystallization rate enables more PLLA/PDLA chains to interdiffuse sufficiently before their cocrystallization. As a result, SC-PLA products with superior heat resistance have been fabricated by the sintering of low-optical-purity SC-PLA powder. These fascinating findings could not only provide new understanding on the low-temperature sintering mechanism of SC-PLA powders but also greatly expand the possibilities for the fabrication of SC-PLA products with superb properties.",

In this work, we report a facile and effective strategy to manipulate the filler network structure and properties of poly(l-lactide)/carbon black (PLLA/CB) nanocomposites with the aid of stereocomplex (SC) crystallization between PLLA matrix and small amounts of poly(d-lactide) (PDLA). The results reveal that the incorporation of only 1 wt % PDLA can facilitate the formation of CB network in PLLA/CB nanocomposites because SC crystallites induced enhancement in the melt viscosity of PLLA matrix could depress CB aggregation, finally leading to an evident decease in the electrical percolation threshold (\u03c6c). However, with further increasing PDLA concentration to 10 wt %, the SC crystallites could organize into a dense network in the matrix and then serve as physical barrier for the networking of CB nanoparticles. As a result, the \u03c6c of the nanocomposites increases sharply....",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Polypropylene (PP) was compounded with \u03b2-nucleating agent and injection-molded at 180\u00a0\u00b0C or 220\u00a0\u00b0C. The samples were subsequently treated by supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2 ) at different temperatures. Results show that processing temperature and scCO 2  treatment could strongly influence the tensile and impact properties of \u03b2-nucleated PP. In particular, the sample processed at 220\u00a0\u00b0C and treated at 120\u00a0\u00b0C exhibit much enhanced impact strength (4.8 times that of its untreated counterpart). FTIR, WAXD, SEM and DMA were performed to explore the effects of processing temperature and scCO 2  treatment on structure of the samples. Deformation-induced plastic flow and micro-voids were also evaluated to construct structure-property relations. It was found that the influence of processing temperature on mechanical properties is mainly associated with the \u03b2-form content and \u03b2-crystalline morphology, while the structural changes in the crystalline lamellar scale may be responsible for the toughening effect of scCO 2  treatment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   As the most promising bio-derived and biodegradable polymers with tremendous application potential, the practical application of poly( l -lactide) (PLLA) has been severely restricted by its inherent brittleness. Unfortunately, blending with various rubbers can substantially enhance the toughness of PLLA, but usually causes a significant deterioration in mechanical strength and modulus. In this work, taking novel PLLA/core-shell rubber (CSR) blends as an example, we describe a facile and robust strategy to obtain good stiffness-toughness balance by promoting the networking of CSR particles within PLLA matrix with the aid of stereocomplex (SC) crystallites. To do this, small amounts (5\u201320\u202fwt%) of poly( d -lactide) (PDLA) were incorporated into the blends through simple melt-blending. The results demonstrate that the CSR particles can be uniformly dispersed in PLLA matrix due to the good interfacial compatibility, but the stereocomplex (SC) crystallites formed between the incorporated PDLA and PLLA matrix chains induces the organization of the CSR particles into a network-like structure in the matrix. Compared with the well-dispersed structure, the network-like structure can endow the PLLA/CSR blends with dramatically enhanced impact toughness, without compromising their mechanical strength and modulus, indicating a marvelous balance between the stiffness and toughness. Furthermore, the elongation at break of the blends is also enhanced greatly. These interesting findings suggest that the formation of SC crystallites could provide a promising avenue for fabricating CSR particles toughened PLLA blends with balanced stiffness-toughness.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Recently, powder metallurgy inspired low-temperature (below the melting temperature) sintering has been proposed as an innovative technology for the processing of eco-friendly stereocomplex-type polylactide (SC-PLA) from its nascent powder, without triggering noticeable thermal degradation. The physicochemical performances of the obtained SC-PLA products are governed by the newly formed SC crystallites with a remarkable ability to weld the interfaces between adjacent powder particles, however, the insufficient interdiffusion of poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) and poly(D-lactide) (PDLA) chains across the interfaces makes it challenging to form sufficient amounts of new SC crystallites. In the present work, we describe a facile and robust strategy to address this challenge by coating a trace amount (e.g., 0.001\u202fwt%) of disentangled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the SC-PLA particle surfaces. During the subsequent sintering, these interface-localized CNTs can function as efficient nucleating agent to substantially promote the SC crystallization of PLLA/PDLA chains on their surfaces and finally countless SC crystallites are formed to strongly weld the interfaces as welded joints. Accordingly, SC-PLA/CNTs products possessing superb heat/solvent resistances and mechanical strength have been fabricated. Impressively, with the introduction of 0.001\u202fwt% CNTs, the tensile strength is significantly enhanced from 45.8\u202fMPa to 67.2\u202fMPa. Most importantly, there is a linear relationship between the tensile strength and the content of the CNTs induced SC crystallites. Overall, this wok could provide a practical guidance for the design and fabrication of high-performance SC-PLA products through low-temperature sintering assisted by nanofillers like CNTs.",

Then two melting temperatures were adopted for fiber spinning, the one (210\u202f\u00b0C) is far below the melting temperature of SC-PLA (i.e., 220\u2013230\u202f\u00b0C), and the other (225\u202f\u00b0C) is close to the melting temperature of SC-PLA. The boiling water shrinkage and tensile strength of PLLA/PDLA fibers were investigated as function of PDLA content. It was found, the boiling water shrinkage could be largely reduced to as low as 5.6% and a satisfactory tensile strength (628\u202fMPa) is achieved for fibers spun at 225\u202f\u00b0C, compared with fibers spun at 210\u202f\u00b0C (7.5% and 500\u202fMPa, respectively), as the PDLA content is 3\u202fwt%. SEM observation suggests a formation of nanofibrillar like SC-PLA structure as spun at 225\u202f\u00b0C, while only spherical SC-PLA particles as spun at 210\u202f\u00b0C. DSC result indicates that adding PDLA could largely enhance the crystallization rate of PLLA, but almost a constant crystallinity and SC-PLA content were observed for both spun fibers, disregarding the spinning temperatures. Hermanu0027s orientation parameters of spun fiber were obtained from 2D-WAXD, which suggests that fiber spun at 225\u202f\u00b0C has higher orientation than that of fiber spun at 210\u202f\u00b0C. Thus it can be concluded that the formation of nanofibrillar like SC-PLA and enhanced orientation degree contribute mainly to the improved heat resistance and tensile strength. This work presents a feasible and effective way to fabricate all-PLA-based fibers with the outstanding heat resistance by adding a small amount of PDLA and using a suitable spinning temperature.",

        "abstract": "Stereocomplexation of enantiomeric poly(l-lactide)/poly(d-lactide) (PLLA/PDLA) chains opens up a great opportunity toward sustainable PLA engineering plastic with exceptional heat resistance and durability. However, the processing and applications of stereocomplex-type PLA (SC-PLA) are significantly blocked by its inferior melt stability (i.e., the weak melt memory effect in triggering complete SC crystallization, which makes it hard to obtain exclusive formation of SC crystallites in melt-processed products) and inherent brittleness. In this contribution, we demonstrate an unprecedented strategy to address these obstacles by one-pot reactive melt blending of the equimolar PLLA/PDLA blend with reactive poly(ethylene\u2013methyl acrylate\u2013glycidyl methacrylate) (E-MA-GMA) in the presence of catalyst, where both the stereocomplexation and the grafting of some PLLA/PDLA chains onto E-MA-GMA backbones take place simultaneously and competitively.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Recently, stereocomplex-type polylactide (SC-PLA) has generated growing interest because the unique SC crystals can provide drastic improvement in the heat/chemical resistances and durability of bio-derived and biodegradable PLA, exhibiting great potential to compete with some petroleum-derived engineering plastics in diverse applications. However, SC-PLA suffers from poor melt memory effect as well as significant thermal degradation after being completely melted at temperatures above 250\u202f\u00b0C, which make it challenging to converse SC-PLA into useful products using versatile melt-processing technologies. With these challenges in mind, in this work, we propose a facile and practical strategy to fabricate SC-PLA products with exceptional thermomechanical properties through low-temperature melt-processing of SC-PLA powder with a bimodal melting temperature distribution. The results show that the melting temperature (     T  m     ) bimodality makes SC-PLA powder able to be easily injection molded at a relatively low temperature of 210\u202f\u00b0C (between the two      T  m     s) due to the selective melting of the low-     T  m      SC-PLA component (SC- l PLA, ca. 20\u201340\u202fwt%), indicating a good melt-processability. Meanwhile, the high-     T  m      SC-PLA (SC- h PLA) component can directly deliver its desirable properties to the injection molded SC-PLA products. More importantly, during the injection molding process, the unmelted SC- h PLA particles can also induce the exclusive SC crystallization of the SC- l PLA melt as nucleating agent and greatly amplify the shear stress imposed on the melt as \u201crigid particles\u201d, finally generating numerous oriented SC structure in the SC- l PLA. Consequently, the injection molded SC- h PLA/SC- l PLA products exhibit impressively high tensile strength (74.3\u202fMPa) and Vicat softening temperature (211.6\u202f\u00b0C). Overall, this work presents an effective guidance for achieving desirable melt-processability of SC-PLA without sacrificing its thermomechanical properties and provides an industrial processing route towards high-performance SC-PLA products.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, nano-fibrillated cellulose (NFC) was used to stabilize the dispersion of chemical reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in aqueous system. Owing to the hydrophobic interactions between the rGO sheets and specific crystalline faces (hydrophobic (200) planes) of NFC as well as electrostatic repulsion between the NFC, a homogenous dispersion of NFC/rGO in water was obtained with good stability. Then the prepared NFC/rGO solution was simultaneously merged into water soluble polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to obtain PVA/NFC/rGO composite freestanding films via a casting method. It was found that the conductivity of the composite films changed rapidly as changing of relative humidity (RH) and exhibited a good repeatability between RH at 50%\u201370%. Compared to PVA/rGO film without NFC, PVA/NFC/rGO film exhibited higher conductivity, sensitivity as well as faster response (lower hysteresis). Thus the prepared PVA/NFC/rGO films could serve as an effect humidity sensor. It was suggested that NFC played several roles in the composite films: (1) as compatibilizer to enhance the dispersion of rGO in PVA matrix, (2) as a bridge to enhance the load transfer and humidity transfer between PVA and rGO, and (3) as water absorber to enhance the sensitivity of humidity.",

To further improve the mechanical properties of OBCs, in this paper, quaternary ammonium salt cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) was firstly introduced as a modifier for the non-covalent functionalization of graphene oxide (GO), then the modified GO (CTAB-GO) was used as a reinforcing agent for OBCs. With the incorporation of CTAB, a fine dispersion of GO in organic solvent and later in the OBC matrix have been achieved. As a result, the mechanical performance is largely improved, e.g., the increases of tensile strength, elongation at break and Youngu0027s modulus are 30%, 13% and 78%, respectively, with 1.0 wt% CTAB-GO incorporation. It is also observed that CTAB-GO exhibits a stronger nucleation ability on crystallization of OBC than pristine GO, which leads to a higher crystallization temperature and smaller size of crystals.",

        "abstract": "The morphology and properties of olefin block copolymer (OBC)/polypropylene (PP) microfibrillar composites (MFCs) were tuned by adding nano silica (SiO2) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) respectively. When the two nanoparticles (NPs) located in the OBC matrix, refined microfibrils were maintained and the final diameters of the PP microfibrils slightly increased compared to the un-modified MFCs; when the NPs located in the dispersed PP component, they exerted a profound impact on the deformation of PP during the fibrillation process. The CNTs can still lead to refined PP microfibrils while addition of SiO2 induces a transition of PP morphology from fibrillar to nodular and even to a spherical structure as its content increases from 0.3 wt% to 1 wt%. The rheological and mechanical properties were also influenced by the type and selective dispersion of NPs. In particular, if the fibrillar morphology of PP was kept in the ternary composites, a small amount of nanoparticles could lead to synergetic enhancement, with polypropylene microfibrils, on the tensile properties of OBC. This work provides a better understanding of the role of NPs in the fiber formation process and an alternative way to control the morphological evolution of MFCs.",

However, the full potential of NFC as reinforcing agent has not been realized because of its poor dispersion and random distribution in polymer matrix. In this work, we demonstrate the importance of alignment of NFC to determine the mechanical properties of polymer via applying alternative current (AC) electric field and using thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) as the matrix. The TPU/NFC nanocomposites were prepared via solution casting method and the effect of parameters of the applied electric field (amplitude, frequency as well as the duration of application) on the orientation degree of NFC and the final properties of TPU/NFC nanocomposites are systematically investigated. It was found that NFC could be easily oriented under effect of AC due to electric induced polarization. The prepared anisotropic TPU/NFC composites exhibit 2.07 and 1.82 times increase of tensile strength and elongation at break in the parallel direction than that in the vertical direction for the anisotropic samples, respectively. It was also interesting, to find that the samples with aligned NFC exhibit an increased dielectric constant with lower dielectric loss, which could provide an idea to fabricate high performance dielectric materials.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Synthesis of hybrid hetero-arms star polymer with precisely defined arms distribution in three dimensional (3D) space is still a challenge. Herein, we have employed cubic polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) nanoparticle as a scaffold to synthesize a biodegradable Janus POSS star polymer ( oom -T 8 PLLA 5 PCL 3 ), which contains an inorganic rigid POSS core, three poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) arms and five poly( l -lactide) (PLLA) arms on the POSS cage two sides, respectively. The chemical structure of  oom -T 8 PLLA 5 PCL 3  was confirmed by NMR, SEC, and FTIR spectra. As an example of application for the Janus POSS star polymer,  oom -T 8 PLLA 5 PCL 3  was used for the compatibilization of biodegradable PLLA/PCL (w/w\u202f=\u202f70/30) blends. It was found that  oom -T 8 PLLA 5 PCL 3  could reduce the dispersed PCL phase size in PLLA matrix and enhance the properties of PLLA/PCL polymer blends, which was reflected in the increase of Izod impact strength and tensile performance of the polymer blends.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Exerting high shear force and adding compatilizer are two different methods used for regulating the size of dispersed phase of polymer blends. Nevertheless, the comparison of the effect of the high shear force and adding compatilizer on the phase morphologyies and properties is less studied, not to mention the synergistic effect. In this work, the incompatible PP/PLA binary blends with large polarity differences were prepared using high-shear processing, compared with the effect of adding ethylene-(methyl acrylate)-(glycidyl methacrylate) (EMA-GMA) as reactive compatibilizer for PP/PLA blends. It was found that adding compatilizer under relative low shear force was more efficient on improving the interface, showing blurred boundaries, compared with the reduction of the dispersed phase size under high shear force without compatilizer. As a result, the blends with the compatilizer presented a higher elongation at break; yet the yield strength of the binary blends prepared under high shear force was higher than that of the ternary blends. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of adding compatibilizer and high shear force was limited, which could be attributed to the fact that the degree of reactive compatibilization had already reached saturation under the rotation speed of 100\u202frpm due to the high efficiency of EMA-GMA.",

In this work, the combined effect of reactive and high-shear extrusion has been carried out in polylactide (PLA)/olefin block copolymer (OBC)/ethylenemethyl acrylate-glycidyl methacrylate terpolymer (EGMA) blends to better control the phase morphologies and improve the properties. It was found that, for PLA/OBC binary blends (80/20), the size of OBC dispersed phase decreased from 1.95 to 1.09\u202f\u03bcm with increasing the rotation speed from 100 to 900\u202frpm, but the obtained phase morphologies couldnu0027t be maintained after annealing treatment. In contrast, for PLA/EGMA binary blends (80/20), the effect of shear force on the dispersed phase size was negligible, due to the efficient reaction even under relative low shear force, and the morphologies of the annealed specimens is stable. For PLA/OBC/EGMA ternary blends, the suitable dispersed phase size and appropriate interfacial adhesion regulated by variations of composition and shear force lead to a significant increase of impact toughness. Super toughened PLA/OBC/EGMA blend (80/10/10\u2013900) after annealing treatment shows impact strength of 49.61\u202fkJ/m 2 , 21 times as comparing to that of the pure PLA. Our work demonstrates the importance of a suitable dispersed phase size and appropriate interfacial adhesion for the improvement of impact strength of PLA/OBC/EGMA blends achieved via a combined effect of reactive and high-shear extrusion.",

High-speed thin wall injection molding (HSTWIM) has recently been demonstrated as an effective method to prepare alternating multilayered structure. To understand the formation mechanism better and explore possible phase morphology for different blends under HSTWIM, the relationship between the morphology evolution of polymer blends based on polypropylene (PP) under HSTWIM and some intrinsic properties of polymer blends, including viscosity ratio, interfacial tension, and melt elasticity, is systematically investigated in this study. Blends based on PP containing polyethylene (PE), ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH), and polylactic acid (PLA) are used as examples. Compatibilizer has also been added into respective blends to alter their interfacial interaction. It is demonstrated that dispersed phase can ...",

        "abstract": "Among all the polymorphs of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), the polar \u03b3-form possesses the highest melting point and electrical breakdown strength as well as the strongest solvent and irradiation resistance, which are beneficial for the durability of PVDF products. Since the \u03b3-form is neither kinetically favorable nor the most thermodynamically stable, it is still difficult to attain the exclusive \u03b3-polymorph, particularly in the case of neat PVDF. In this study, the melt isothermal crystallization of PVDF films was carried out between two KBr wafers. Owing to the characteristics of KBr wafer, including no IR absorbance and high optical transmittance, the crystallographic features originating from the KBr substrate can be conveniently elucidated through the in situ inspected techniques of FTIR and PLM. The KBr wafers significantly accelerated the crystallization kinetics of \u03b1-crystals, and then readily triggered the solid-state \u03b1- to \u03b3-transformation of the pre-formed \u03b1-spherulites, resulting in a 10 \u03bcm-thick, neat PVDF film with an absolute crystallinity of 35% and a relative \u03b3 fraction as high as 94%. When the film thickness was increased to 40 \u03bcm, the crystallization rate of the \u03b1-form was still rapid, but the solid-state transformation was not appreciable. These interesting crystallographic phenomena are attributed to the existence of ion-dipole interaction between the -CF or -CH of PVDF chains and the surface of KBr wafer. Unlike most traditional substrate-dominated crystallizations that prevail in a surface epitaxy manner, in which the target films are of ultra-thin thickness (of the order of 10 nm), the ion-dipole interaction promotes the effective thickness to a ten micron level, which enables its production and application at scalable level. Moreover, the triggering of \u03b1- to \u03b3-transformation via external fields could be an alternative for achieving the \u03b3-dominant PVDF products, particularly when the introduction of external additives is prohibited.",

        "abstract": "The applications of Polylactide (PLA) microspheres in biomedical areas are greatly determined by the size, morphology and internal structure. Taking advantage of the formation of stereocomplex (SC) crystallites between poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) and poly(D-lactide) (PDLA), we propose a facile strategy to prepare PLA microspheres with tunable morphology and crystalline structure by compounding PLLA and PDLA. With increasing PDLA content, the crystallinity of SC-PLA rose gradually until the ratio of PLLA and PDLA reached 1:1 and then fell. Correspondingly, the morphology of the microspheres were varied (smooth, porous, golf-ball like, guava like) and higher crystallinity of SC-PLA would lead to a more coarse and porous structure. Finally, three typical kinds of Rifampicin-loaded microspheres with different ratio of PLLA and PDLA (7:3, 3:7, 10:0, sorted by porosity from high to low) were prepared and the release behavior was compared. At 30 h, the cumulative release of 7:3, 3:7 and 10:0 microspheres were 32.6%, 17.8% and 6.0% respectively, indicating that the release profiles were generally determined by the porosity of the microspheres. Our findings not only provide a new strategy to prepare PLA microspheres with controllable morphology but offer additional possibilities for the applications of SC-PLA products in biomedical area.",

Isotactic polypropylene (iPP)/poly(l-lactide) (PLLA)/EGMA/DCP blends showed remarkably improved impact toughness and excellent flexibility, moderate levels of strength, and modulus. Reactive compatibilization between iPP and EGMA as well as PLLA and EGMA was studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The \u201csalami\u201d-like phase structure of the dispersed domains in the iPP/PLLA/EGMA ternary blends was observed. With the further addition of DCP, the EGMA phase evolved from occluded sub-inclusions into an interface boundary. The significant increase in impact strength of iPP/PLLA/EGMA/DCP blends was ascribed to the effective interfacial compatibilization. This study provides a new route to prepare a cost-effective material with partial biodegradability, good impact toughness, and tensile strength. Meanwhile, a deep insight into the optimization of properties of multicomponent blends by morphology transition was proposed.",

        "title": "Polymorphic structures phase diagram of shear-induced isotactic polypropylene/carbon fiber cylindrites",
        "abstract": "Abstract   Depending on the thermal and mechanical conditions of pulling fiber in the supercooled melts of isotactic polypropylene (iPP), three kinds of cylindrite with variable polymorphic structure could be achieved, i.e., pure \u03b1-cylindrite, mixed \u03b1/\u03b2 cylindrite, and \u03b2-rich cylindrite. However, precisely assessing the synergic action of thermal and mechanical factors on polymorphic structure of cylindrite is still challenging. Thanks to the great convenience of temperature gradient ( T -g) technique in surveying structural transitions arisen from temperature variation, a crystallization temperature ( T  c )-pulling rate ( R  pull ) dependent phase diagram of polymorphs in iPP/carbon fiber (CF) cylindrite was achieved readily through adopting different  R  pull s. It was intriguing to suggest that (1) the temperature regime of mixed \u03b1/\u03b2 cylindrite became narrower and narrower as increasing  R  pull , implying a sudden transition from \u03b2-polymorph to \u03b1-polymorph upon intensive shearing; and (2) the upper threshold temperature that allowing generation of \u03b2 fan-shaped domain was independent on  R  pull , around 145\u202f\u00b0C. Moreover, the structural difference between mixed \u03b1/\u03b2 cylindrite and \u03b2-rich cylindrite was revealed in detail by scanning electron microscopy. An approximately regular nucleation line of \u03b2-form appeared in \u03b2-rich cylindrite, due to prevailing \u03b1-to-\u03b2 bifurcation arisen from the edge-on \u03b1-lamellae. Whereas, occasional \u03b1/\u03b2 bifurcation was found among a tremendous number of \u03b1-lamellae within the mixed \u03b1/\u03b2 regime. Constructing the polymorphs phase diagram is of significance in manipulation of interfacial crystallization entities and fabrication of fiber-reinforced semi-crystalline polymers with high performances.    Brief abstract  In this study, the combined effect of crystallization temperature ( T  c ) and pulling rate ( R  pull ) on the polymorphic structure of shear-induced cylindrite in isotactic polypropylene (iPP)/carbon fiber (CF) composite was well ascertained by using the  T -g field technique. It was found that reducing  T  c  or improving  R  pull  might induce the transformations of polymorphism from pure \u03b1-cylindrite to mixed \u03b1/\u03b2 cylindrite up to \u03b2-rich cylindrite. A crystallization temperature ( T  c )-pulling rate ( R  pull ) dependent phase diagram of polymorphs in iPP/CF cylindrite was achieved readily. It was intriguing to suggest that (1) the temperature regime of mixed \u03b1/\u03b2 cylindrite became narrower and narrower as increasing  R  pull , implying a sudden transition from \u03b2-polymorph to \u03b1-polymorph upon intensive shearing; and (2) the upper threshold temperature that allowing generation of \u03b2 fan-shaped domain was independent on  R  pull , around 145\u202f\u00b0C. The findings of this study are meaningful for construction of appropriate interfacially-crystallized structure, which could efficiently induce interfacial enhancement in polymer/fiber composites.",

        "abstract": "Shape-memory polymers are highly desirable in implant biomaterials for minimally invasive surgical procedures. However, most of them lack suitable transition temperature, mechanical properties, and biodegradability. Here, a series of shape-memory polyurethanes are synthesized by postcrosslinking in hard-segment domains using a flexible crosslinker. The materials used are all nontoxic and biodegradable. Through postcrosslinking of unsaturated linear polyurethanes with flexible and biodegradable crosslinker, the crosslinked polyurethanes (CPUs) show good mechanical properties, excellent shape-memory property, and repeatability. The post-crosslinking structure and shape-memory mechanism of CPUs are investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and dynamic mechanical analysis tests. The crosslinker endows the fixed phase enough crosslinking and inserts in the hard segments to give the fixed phase certain elasticity. The elastic hard segments make them form more hydrogen bonds with soft segments during shape deformation. The low-molecular-weight poly (\u03b5-caprolactone) offers the samples a shape-memory transition temperature at around 37 \u00b0C, which is suitable for implant devices in vivo. This work expands CPUs with an elastic crosslinking structure as potential candidates for implant biomaterials. Since the post-crosslinking polymerization is facile, it can be convenient for industrial production.",

These polyurethanes were based on poly hexamethylene carbonate (PHMC) /polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mixed macrodiols with molar ratio of PDMS ranging from 5% to 30%. It was proved that PDMS tended to migrate toward surface and even a small amount of PDMS could form a silicone-like surface. Macrophages-mediated oxidation process indicated that the PDMS surface layer was desirable to protect the fragile soft PHMC from the attack of degradative species. Hydrolysis process was probed in detail after immersing in boiling buffered water using combined analytical tools. Hydrolytically stable PDMS could act as protective shields for the bulk to hinder the chain scission of polycarbonate carbonyls whereas the hydrolysis of urethane linkages was less affected. Although the promoted phase separation at higher PDMS fractions lead to possible physical defects and mechanical compromise after degradation, simultaneously enhanced oxidation and hydrolysis resistance could be achieved for the polyurethanes with proper PDMS incorporation.",

To understand the interactions of GQA and PEG groups and their effects on the biophysicochemical characteristics of nanocarriers, a series of polyurethane micelles containing GQA and different molecular weights of PEG were prepared and carefully characterized. It was found that the GQA and PEG groups are unevenly distributed on the micellar surface to form two kinds of hydrophilic domains. As a result, the particle surface with some defects cannot be completely shielded by the PEG corona. Despite this, the longer PEG chains with a brush conformation provide superior stabilization and steric repulsion against the absorption of proteins and, thus, can reduce the cytotoxicity, protein absorption, and MPS uptake of micelles to some extent. This study provides a new understanding on the interactions between PEG chains and cationic groups and a guideline for the design and fabrication of safe and effective drug delivery systems.",

        "abstract": "Complications such as thromboembolism and bacterial infection, arising from the widespread use of implanted medical devices, are serious problems for current clinical treatment. In this work, dual-functional anticoagulant and antibacterial blend coatings were designed and fabricated from gemini quaternary ammonium salt waterborne polyurethane (GWPU) emulsion and heparin aqueous solution. The results demonstrate that the L-lysine-derivative gemini quaternary ammonium salt (GQAS) in GWPU endows the coating with excellent non-releasing antibacterial ability and simultaneously the release of heparin provides superior anticoagulant activity. Moreover, the controlled release of heparin is achieved by the ionic interaction between the positive charge in GQAS and the negative charge in heparin. On the basis of the dual-functional anticoagulant and antibacterial properties of GWPU/heparin blend coatings, this work proposes a facile strategy to achieve syncretic performances in biomaterials, and these coatings would have the potential to improve the application of implanted devices.",

        "abstract": "Polyisoprene (PI) is the main component of natural rubber. To imitate natural rubber and understand the function of phospholipid in natural rubber, a novel phosphatidylcholine (PC)-modified polyisoprene (PI-pc) is synthesized using a PC and a commercial PI. The PI is firstly brominated by N-bromosuccinimide, and then, diethyl malonate is introduced as a branch chain of PI. In sequence, the PC is imported into the branch chain of PI via condensation of the activated ester terminals in diethyl malonate and the amino terminals in PC to obtain the desired product PI-pc. The bulk structure of the prepared PI-pc is carefully characterized with nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (1H and 31P NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), gel permeation chromatograph (GPC), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The introduction of PC to the branch chain of PI increases the molecular weight and also the glass transition (Tg) of the PI. The increment of Tgs and melting enthalpy for the PI-pcs from both solution and emulsion indicates that the attached PC is beneficial to the self-assembly of PI chains and thus promotes the crystallization. Our present work provides a new method for importing PC to PI to imitate natural rubber, and also, the results could be a footstone for us to explore the effect of phospholipid on the property of natural rubber.",

To obtain these polyurethanes, lysine-derivative gemini quaternary ammonium salt (GQAS) chain extenders with different hydrophobic alkyl chain lengths (named EGn, where n = 8, 12, 16; the hydrophobic alkyl chain length of GQAS) were designed and synthesized. Then, waterborne biodegradable polyurethanes (PCLPUn) were prepared using isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), L-lysine and EGn. The antibacterial activities of these EGn and PCLPUn emulsions were evaluated by a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) method, and the antibacterial and antifouling functionalities of the PCLPUn film surfaces were confirmed by a contact-active antibacterial and culture-based method using both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The in vitro degradation and cytotoxicity of these obtained polyurethanes were also systematically investigated. These results indicated that the PCLPUn films possessed good antibacterial and antifouling abilities, biodegradability, and good biocompatibility. Notably, PCLPU12 shows the best antibacterial activity and cytocompatibility. Such antibacterial materials could be degraded to non-toxic components, and potentially be widely used in medical and environmental applications, especially as biodegradable coatings of surgical equipment and medical implants.",

        "abstract": "Constructing a biomimetic hierarchical structure is of great benefit to achieve materials with expected high performance. In this work, a new Fmoc-diphenylalanine (Fmoc-FF) based peptide extender (PPE) is synthesized for preparing a series of waterborne polyurethanes (WPUs) to construct a hydrophilic surface and a hydrophobic subsurface. A pre-assembly structure of the WPU emulsion particle is achieved by the introduction of PPE. It possesses a compact core consisting of hydrophobic segments of Fmoc-FF with \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking and a loose shell consisting of hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) segments. The self-assembled Fmoc-FF could also enhance the phase separation between soft segments and hard segments. During film formation by demulsification, the outer PEG segments easily migrate onto the surface and the hydrophobic compact cores aggregate into the subsurface. Such an architecture endows WPU films with simultaneous biocompatibility, antifouling ability, and water resistance under wet conditions. This work provides a new insight into the design of a polymer emulsion with a pre-assembled phase to construct the expected hierarchical structure of films or coatings for biomaterials and antifouling materials.",

        "abstract": "The mechanical and biodegradable properties of hydrogels are two essential properties for practical biomaterial applications. In this work, a series of biodegradable polyurethane (PU) hydrogels were successfully synthesized using two kinds of triol crosslinkers with different chain structures. One crosslinker is normal glycerol (GC) with short chain length, and the other is biodegradable poly (\u03b5-caprolactone)-triol (CAPA) with long chain length. All PU hydrogels showed considerable water uptake around ~60%, excellent strength (above 3 MPa), advisable modulus (0.9~1.7 MPa), high elasticity (above 700%), as well as good biodegradability and biocompatibility. Hydrogen bonds served as reversible sacrificial bonds in the PU hydrogels endow them good toughness with partial hysteresis during deformation. The biodegradable long chain crosslinker CAPA can certainly accelerate the degradation of PU hydrogels compared with the GC crosslinked hydrogels. The degradation of these hydrogels was a process of continuous erosion from the surface to interior, which contributes to the high remain of mechanical properties after 30 days-degradation. Besides, the hydrogels also show excellent antifouling ability of protein and anti-adhesion of cells. Therefore, these hydrogels suggest great potential used as biological anti-adhesive membranes or catheters. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Hierarchical self-assembly of synthetic polypeptides has attracted increasing interests due to its protein-mimetic structure and great potential in nanotechnology and biomedical applications. However, controlling the morphology and function of polymeric nanostructures via secondary structures remains largely unexplored. Here, we report an unusual micelle-to-vesicle transformation of cholesterol-decorated poly(L-cysteine) copolymer assemblies in response to reac-tive oxygen species (ROS). We found that the interesting morphological transition correlates with the alteration in conformations from \u03b2-sheet to \u03b1-helix, which grants an attractive \"on-off\" switch for triggered release and cellular interaction. We further demonstrated the usefulness of the conformation-regulated assembly strategy both in vitro and in vivo, taking cancer treatment as a model. The work offers a new insight on the folding and hierarchical assembly of polypeptides and a novel approach for the development of smart platforms in biosensing, disease treatment and diagnostic applications.",

Micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (micro-FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were further employed to investigate the molecular chain orientation and internal structure within the interfacial crystalline region. Based on the theory of heterogeneous nucleation and the theory of crystal growth rate, the nucleating ability of the rGOF toward PLLA was evaluated with regards to the value of the interfacial free energy difference function \u0394\u03c3.

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this work, a comparison study was carried out to investigate the efficacy of glass fiber (GF) in reinforcing poly(lactic acid) (PLA) by using traditional silane coupling agents (GF-S) and novel graphene oxide (GF-GO) as surface modifiers. The crystallization behavior of the PLA matrix was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry. The mechanical performances and the thermomechanical properties of the composites were evaluated by uniaxial tensile testing and dynamic mechanical analysis, respectively. For neat GF without any treatment, the poor interfacial adhesion and the sharp shortening of the GF length result in the relatively poor mechanical performances of PLA/GF composites. However, the incorporation of GF-S significantly improves the mechanical strength and keeps relatively good toughness of the composites, while GF-GO exhibits excellent nucleation ability for PLA and could moderately increase the modulus of the composites. The thermomechanical properties of the composites are improved markedly resulting from the crystallinity increase. The different surface modification of glass fiber influences the crystallinity of matrix, the interfacial interaction and the length of fiber, which altogether affect the mechanical performances of the prepared PLA/GF composites.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In recent years, hybrid fillers with different dimension are frequently used to improve the thermal conductivity of polymer/filler composites. While the combined effect of hybrid filler and orientation on the thermal conductivity of polymer/filler composites has rarely reported. In this work, high density polyethylene (HDPE)/boron nitride (BN)/carbon nanotubes (CNT) ternary composites were prepared by melt blending then hot rolled to obtain oriented sheets. The thermal conductivity and internal structure of the obtained sheets were investigated and compared with those obtained by hot-pressed sheets with random distributed structure. Two representative systems were used, the one is that BN content is low and forms the isolated dispersions (using HDPE/5BN/CNT composites with 5\u202fwt% of BN as example), the other one is that BN content is high and forms network structure (using HDPE/25BN/CNT composites with 25\u202fwt% of BN as example). For hot-pressed samples, no synergy between BN and CNT was found for HDPE/5BN/CNT system with BN dispersed in isolation in HDPE matrix, while an obvious increase of thermal conductivity was seen for HDPE/25BN/CNT system with BN network formation in HDPE matrix, and a 300% increase of thermal conductivity could be achieved as 3\u202fwt% of CNT was added, compared with that of net HDPE. For hot-rolled samples, an increase of thermal conductivity was observed for both HDPE/5BN/CNT and HDPE/25BN/CNT ternary composites by adding CNT into the composites, suggesting the importance of filler orientation in the enhancement of thermal conductivity in polymer/filler composites with hybrid filler. The combined effect of hybrid filler and orientation could result in a further increase of thermal conductivity and 600% increase of thermal conductivity could be achieved. Finally, based on the analysis of internal structure of prepared samples as obtained by SEM observation, rheology and XRD measurements, a possible mechanism for the enhancement of thermal conductivity via hybrid and orientation was proposed. Our work is important and could shed light for the preparation of polymer composites with super thermal conductivity.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this work, renewable poly(lactic acid) (PLA) was mixed with recyclable milled glass fiber (MGF) to improve its crystallization and mechanical properties, which is also good for building a circular economy. To improve the interface interaction between PLA and MGF, silane coupling agent was first adopted as surface modifier, then silica nanoparticles (SiO 2 ) with different size (7\u202fnm and 30\u202fnm) were introduced onto the MGF surface via self-assembly strategy (MGF@SiO 2 ). It is found that MGF@SiO 2  could enhance the crystallization of PLA, even result in a formation of transcrystallization. Moreover, the interfacial interaction could be greatly enhanced via introducing SiO 2  (especially 30\u202fnm SiO 2 ) onto the fiber surface, which could form mechanical locking. As a result, an obvious improvement of mechanical properties has been achieved. This new approach offers an effective way to adjust the interface structure and the interface interaction, thus helping tailor the performance of polymer/fiber composites.",

However, polymer composites\u2019 BDS is usually compromised by the filler\u2019s agglomeration, thus resulting in very limited increase in the energy density. In this work, we adopted a high-shear extrusion technique to improve filler\u2019s dispersion. A synergistic effect between montmorillonite (oMMT) and boron nitride (BN) on BDS of polypropylene was observed, particularly for samples prepared by high shear extrusion. As a result, the energy density of PP can be improved from 2.98\u202fJ/cm 3  to as high as 5.14\u202fJ/cm 3  while energy discharged efficiency barely changed. In addition, we have also demonstrated that PP/oMMT/BN ternary composites prepared by high shear extrusion show much improved mechanical properties. This work offers a scalable fabrication of PP based nanocomposites with superior energy density that could be easily achieved by using hybrid fillers and high shear extrusion.",

The morphological control of functional fillers is thought as an effective approach to achieve this. Herein, a novel method involves the confinement of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in phosphate glass (Pglass) domains is presented. Due to the large interfacial tension between Pglass and polymer matrix, strong confinement of CNTs can be achieved while CNTs is incorporated into Pglass. Thus, the formation of CNTs conductive networks in polymer matrix can be prohibited in ternary polymer/Pglass/CNTs composites. Comparing with similar composites having high density polyethylene (HDPE) to realize confinement on CNTs, much higher thermal conductivity and much lower electrical conductivity are observed in polymer composites based on polypropylene (PP) containing boron nitride (BN). It is thought that the use of Pglass can provide an effective method for the preparation of thermally conductive and electrically insulating polymer composites.",

The surface characteristics and size of these secondary insulating fillers should significantly influence the pressure/strain sensing behavior due to its influence on the morphology of conductive network and interfacial interaction between filler and polymer matrix. Herein, insulating SiO 2  with different size and surface characteristics are incorporated into carbon black (CB)/silicon rubber (SR) composites to modify its piezo-resistive behavior. The conductivity of CB/SiO 2 /SR composites with nanoscale and hydrophobic SiO 2  changes by several orders of magnitude, with more linear proportional to applied pressure and better stability under long term cyclic pressure due to better dispersion and stronger interfacial interaction. Through such simple method, high-performance piezo-resistive sensors could be fabricated with reversible piezo-resistivity, large pressure application (pressure below 2500\u00a0kPa) and tunable piezo-resistive sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Tin fluorophosphate glass (Pglass)/polymer composites have been widely investigated due to their applications in areas including: gas barrier, electronic packaging and fire retardant, etc. The compatibility between Pglass and polymer matrix is rather poor due to the large interfacial tension. Novel method is urgently needed to address this issue so that the interfacial interaction, specific interfacial area as well as aspect ratio of Pglass could be enlarged, which could lead to significant enhancement in various properties. Current study aims to compatibilize Pglass/polymer composites through a newly synthesized compatibilizer: poly(\u03b1-aminophosphonate) (polyAPP), using \u201cone pot\u201d Kabachnik-Fields (KF)-Reversible Addition-Fragmentation Chain Transfer (RAFT) polymerization. Comparing to commonly used compatibilizer: silane coupling agents 3-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (KH550) and polydopamine (PDA), polyAPP is found to enhance the interfacial interaction of Pglass and maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MA-PP), and decrease the dispersed phase size of Pglass in polymer matrix. It is much smaller than the results reported in literature for polyolefin based systems. Meanwhile, enhanced mechanical performance is also observed in such system, the tensile strength and modulus increased by 22% and 33% comparing to the pristine MA-PP, which can be attributed to the enhancement of the interaction between Pglass and polymer matrix. Such method could provide some guideline for the preparation of high performance Pglass/polymer composites as well as a range of functional polymer composites.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Utilizing the synergistic effect of various fillers is an efficient strategy to enhance the thermal conductivity of polymer composites, in which the key is to modulate their dispersion and network formation in polymer matrix. In this work, expanded graphite (EG) was individually added into high density polyethylene (HDPE) to fabricate first the binary composites through melt blending. The electrical conductivity of the prepared composites was measured to determine the percolation threshold for HDPE/EG composites. Then HDPE/EG composites with three compositions, representing below percolation, just percolation and above percolation, respectively, were chosen as matrix and melt mixed with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to make HDPE/EG/CNTs ternary composites. It was found that adding CNTs results in a linear increase of thermal conductivity for HDPE/EG composites with composition below percolation, along the line by adding the same amount of EG. While a jump of thermal conductivity was observed by adding CNTs for HDPE/EG composites with composition just and above percolation. The electrical conductivity and rheology property were measured and SEM experiment was carried out to explore the filler dispersion and their network formation in HDPE matrix. All the results suggested a possible location CNTs in EG filler network for HDPE/EG composites with composition just and above percolation. Thus the formation of CNTs network within EG network is attributed to the main reason for the largely enhanced thermal property. This work endows a new enlightenment to fabricate the composites with a great thermal conductivity.",

Ni(OH)2 nanosheets are grown uniformly on the surface of GO sheets, such hybrid filler can bring a number of advantages for resulted composites: 1. Ni(OH)2 could reduce the dielectric constant contrast between graphene and PVDF; 2. The special structure of such hybrid filler could lead to enhanced breakdown strength; 3. Strong interfacial interaction between filler and matrix could be achieved due to the hydroxyl groups on the surface of such hybrid filler. As a result, 1.25 wt% of such hybrid filler leads to dielectric constant of 12.05 at 103 Hz for the final composites, which is higher than neat PVDF (\u22489.6). While the tano\u0302 is limited at 0.011 which is much lower than GO based composites. And the breakdown strength is 254 kV mm-1, an enhancement of 20.9% over neat PVDF. More importantly, an energy density of 3.89 J cm-3 can be achieved, with an enhancement of 2.6 times over GO/PVDF (1.47 J cm-3) and 1.57 times over neat PVDF (2.47 J cm-3). Furthermore, this study provides a one-step environmental friendly method for the fabrication of functional filler for various functional polymer nanocomposites.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   High dielectric constant filler is often used to improve the dielectric properties of polymer. Most studies are focused on the uniform filler dispersion and interface between filler and polymer. Herein, multi-layered films containing BaTiO 3  and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as fillers, with different filler distributions were designed and prepared, including alternating distribution of layers with/without filler; core-shell distribution with filler concentrated at core or shell; and uniform distribution. The overall filler content in these films was kept constant. These films have almost the same dielectric loss. Interestingly, it was noted that the largest dielectric constant is achieved for sample with filler concentrated at the shell (around 50% higher than the rest at low frequency). Interfacial polarization and filler localization are thought to play important role. However, classic Series model does not take these issues into account. To understand this, a modified Series model was proposed to calculate the dielectric constant of multi-layered films by considering these issues. Such equation is much more accurate at describing experimental results from current study as well as some published literature than classic Series model. Our work demonstrates the importance of hierarchical structure in polymer composites for dielectric property and heterogeneous distribution of filler could be much better than uniform distribution.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The dispersion of nano-barium titanate(NBT) in polyvinylidene fluoride(PVDF) is one of the key issues in dielectric composites. Various NBT surface modification strategies which suffer from complex process and small-scale production have been reported. Herein, in-situ synthesized three-dimensional Ni(OH) 2  is introduced to improve NBT dispersion in PVDF. During hydrothermal reaction, NBT aggregates are dispersed on the petals of in-situ grown Ni(OH) 2  crystals as small aggregates. The three-dimensional structure of Ni(OH) 2  can act as physical barrier to prohibit secondary agglomeration in PVDF to allow rather uniform NBT dispersion. Meanwhile, these hydroxyl groups on Ni(OH) 2  ensures good interaction between filler and PVDF, and trigger \u03b2 crystals. Comparing with NBT/PVDF containing the same amount of filler(2.5\u202fwt%), the breakdown strength and maximum energy density containing mixed filler increases 14% and 70%, reach 282.6\u202fKV/mm and 6.13\u202fJ\u202fcm \u22123 , respectively.

To tackle this, current study demonstrates a novel type of dielectric filler for the preparation of high performance dielectric composites: Ni(OH) 2 . Due to the abundant  OH groups on their filler surface, hydrogen bond is observed between Ni(OH) 2  and PVDF matrix, and beta form crystal of PVDF is induced. Among 0D, 2D and 3D Ni(OH) 2 , the platelet 2D Ni(OH) 2 /PVDF composite illustrates the highest dielectric constant (16.3), breakdown strength (421\u202fkV/mm) and energy density (17.3\u202fJ/m 3 ) with as little as 5\u202fwt% (3.02\u202fvol%) Ni(OH) 2  in PVDF matrix. Such value is rather large comparing with many literature results. More importantly, this method does not involve any filler surface modification. Moreover, finite element simulations indicate that the distribution of electric field and energy density for composites containing platelet like Ni(OH) 2  is more uniform than the rest, which should be the mechanism for enhanced dielectric performances.

        "abstract": "Abstract   The preparation of elastomer/plastic blends with co-continuous structure is beneficial to achieve good shape recovery and fixing performances. In this work, carbon black (CB) nanoparticles with self-networking capability were introduced to tailor the phase morphology and shape memory properties of polylactide (PLA)/thermoplastic poly(ether) urethane (TPU) blend (70/30 by weight). A morphological change from sea-island structure to co-continuous structure was observed with increasing CB content. The strong affinities between CB nanoparticles and TPU as well as the self-networking capability of CB nanoparticles led to the formation of this co-continuous structure. With such novel structure, the PLA70/TPU30/CB ternary composites owned an outstanding shape memory property because the continuous TPU phase provided stronger recovery driving force. Moreover, the selective localization of CB nanoparticles in the continuous TPU phase imparted the composites with enhanced mechanical properties and excellent electrical conductivities with low filler content. The composites then showed a good electroactive shape memory behavior, which could recover to their original shape within 80\u00a0s at 30\u00a0V. Our work provides a universal strategy via CB self-networking to prepare double percolated conductive polymer composites with optimal shape memory properties and excellent electrical conductivities, which may promote specific applications in intelligent devices.",

The formation of double percolation network imparted TPU/PLA/MWCNT conductive polymer composites with high electrical conductivities in low percolation thresholds, thus realized rapidly electro-active shape memory behaviors. Additionally, the mechanical properties of TPU/PLA blends (50/50, 60/40) can be enhanced by the addition of MWCNTs even at high temperature. Therefore, our work provides a simple way to fabricate polymer blends with rapid electro-active shape memory performances, good mechanical properties as well as good processing capability but low cost.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Optically transparent poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-based blends with significantly enhanced mechanical and shape memory properties have been successfully prepared via in-situ formation of micro-scale polylactide stereocomplex crystallites (sc-PLA) in the PMMA matrix in this work. To achieve this goal, a certain content of poly(  l  -lactide) (PLLA) was firstly melt-blended with PMMA to obtain completely miscible PMMA/PLLA blends, and then an equimolar poly(  d  -lactide) (PDLA) was incorporated into the blends, giving rise to the in-situ formation of sc-PLA between PLLA and PDLA. In this way, the micro-scale sc-PLA particles were successfully fabricated and homogeneously dispersed in the PMMA matrix. Consequently, these resultant PMMA/sc-PLA blends possess extremely superior optical transparency, even when the content of sc-PLA reaches up to 12\u00a0wt%. A further increase in the content of sc-PLA would lead to the formation of sc-PLA network and aggregation, resulting in the deterioration of optical transparency. Moreover, the incorporation of sc-PLA micro-particles significantly enhances the mechanical property of PMMA and the maximum (\u2248103\u00a0MPa) of these blends demonstrates 50% increase than that (\u224870\u00a0MPa) of PMMA. More importantly, it has been found that the shape recovery performance of PMMA could be effectively improved by the incorporation of sc-PLA. The optimal shape recovery ratio (86%) and high shape fixing ratio (almost 100%) can be obtained for the PMMA/sc12 blend which exhibits excellent optical transparency. It is reasonable to believe that these optically transparent blends with largely enhanced mechanical and shape memory properties possess great application potential in advanced shape memory fields.",

        "abstract": "In this work, hybrid conductive fillers of carbon black (CB) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were introduced into polylactide (PLA)/thermoplastic poly(ether)urethane (TPU) blend (70/30 by weight) to tune the phase morphology and realize rapid electrically actuated shape memory effect (SME). Particularly, the dispersion of conductive fillers, the phase morphology, the electrical conductivities and the shape memory properties of the composites containing CB or CB/CNTs were comparatively investigated. The results suggested that both CB and CNTs were selectively localized in TPU phase, and induced the morphological change from the sea-island structure to the co-continuous structure. The presence of CNTs resulted in a denser CB/CNTs network, which enhanced the continuity of TPU phase. Because the formed continuous TPU phase provided stronger recovery driving force, the PLA/TPU/CB/CNTs composites showed better shape recovery properties compared with the PLA/TPU/CB composites at the same CB content. Moreover, the CB and CNTs exerted a synergistic effect on enhancing the electrical conductivities of the composites. As a result, the prepared composites exhibited excellent electrically actuated SME and the shape recovery speed was also greatly enhanced. This work demonstrated a promising strategy to achieve rapid electrically actuated SME via the addition of hybrid nanoparticles with self-networking ability in binary PLA/TPU blends over a much larger composition range.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, we reported a rapid electroactive ternary shape memory polymer (SMP) composites containing multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and two biodegradable polyesters, namely poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA). To do this, binary polymer blends were firstly prepared, and a good shape memory behavior was observed for blends with co-continuous phase morphology, where by PPC acted as the switching domain due to its good elasticity and PLA acted as the fixing domain due to its high modulus. Then MWCNTs were incorporated into PPC/PLA co-continuous phase (PPC70/PLA30, PPC50/PLA50) by simple melting blending to realize the electroactive shape memory properties. It was found that MWCNTs tended to locate more in the PPC phase than in the PLA phase. The selective localization of MWCNTs not only led to an improvement in the recovery force, but also imparted composites with high electrical conductivity in a low percolation threshold. The composites showed rapid electroactive shape memory behavior, which reached a shape recovery ratio of 97% within 30\u00a0s\u00a0at 30\u00a0V. Our work provides a simple approach to utilize the selective localization of MWCNTs in the continuous phase to fabricate rapid electrical actuated SMPs with low MWCNTs loadings, which can be scaled up industrially.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the expression of YAP protein by immunohistochemistry in prostate cancer tissues and hyperplasia or normal prostate tissues adjacent to cancer, and establish the correlation of YAP expression with Gleason score.The expression of YAP protein was evaluated in tissue microarray by immunohistochemistry. The samples included 66 radical prostatectomy specimens with clinically detected prostate cancer and 54 hyperplasia or normal prostate tissues adjacent to cancer.YAP expression was present mainly in the nuclei of basal cells in both prostate cancer tissues and normal prostate or hyperplasia tissues adjacent to cancer. Cytoplasmic expression of YAP was weaker than nuclear expression in both malignant and nonmalignant luminal epithelial cells. YAP expression was decreased or lost in prostate cancer tissues; hyperplasia or normal prostate tissues adjacent to cancer exhibited stronger nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of YAP (p = 0.0001). Downregulation of YAP expression in prostate cancer samples correlated with Gleason score increase (p = 0.002).This immunohistochemical study expands our knowledge of the expression and localization of YAP in prostate cancer tissue and nonmalignant prostate tissue adjacent to cancer. YAP might function as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer. Such information may provide the foundation for the treatment of preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions of the prostate.",

Electron microscopy revealed few CN and major pelvic ganglion (MPG) lesions in the BCNI + hUCBMSCs group. Injected hUCBMSCs were localized to the sinusoid endothelium of the penis and MPG on day 1, 3, 7, and 28 post-intracavernous injection.hUCBMSCs intracavernous injection treatment improves erectile function by inhibiting corpus cavernosum fibrosis and exerting neuroregenerative effects on cell bodies of injured nerves at MPG in a BCNI rat model.",

Tregs were defined as CD4(+)CD25(high)CD127(low/-) T cells. The frequency of Tregs in peripheral blood and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were determined by flow cytometry. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in surgical resection specimens were measured with a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Microvessel density (MVD) was calculated on slides stained with CD34 antibody. Spearman's rank correlation was performed to evaluate the correlation between the frequencies of Tregs in TILs and VEGF values, as well as between frequencies of Tregs and MVD determinations.Compared to healthy controls, the frequency of peripheral blood Tregs was significantly increased in patients with RCC (P < 0.05). The percentage of tumor-infiltrating Tregs was higher than that of peripheral blood Tregs in patients with RCC (P < 0.01). In addition, the frequency of tumor-infiltrating Tregs was shown to significantly correlate with the pathological stage (P < 0.05) and nuclear grade (P < 0.01). Importantly, a significant positive correlation was observed between the frequency of tumor-infiltrating Tregs and VEGF protein expression (r = 0.51, P < 0.05), as well as between frequencies of Tregs and MVD score (r = 0.39, P < 0.05).These observations suggest that the high pro-angiogenic status of RCC may be associated with the accumulation of Tregs in the local microenvironment. Angiogenesis networks may be connected with immune tolerance units and cooperate with each other to facilitate tumor growth and progression.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To construct two conditional replication-competent adenoviral vectors (CRAs) driven by alpha fetoprotein (AFP)300bp promoter and 300bp promoter+AFP 800bp enhancer respectively,and to find a better CRA vector for liver cancer targeting therapy. Methods:The minimal essential DNA fragment of the AFP gene promoter and enhancer was amplified through PCR from the genome of HepG2 cells. Construct the plasmid pAFPp-EGFPluc and pAFPep-EGFPluc to evaluate the activity of the AFP promoter and enhancer by the way of flow cytometry and detect fluorescence. Then construct the shuttle plasmid pDC311-AFPp-E1A and pDC311-AFPep-E1A and construct the conditional replicative adnovirus (CRAs)Ad.AFPp-E1A and Ad.AFPep-E1A. The ability of conditional replication was detected and compared by western blot, virus multiplication test and CPE. At last measure the oncolytic efficacy of these two viruses in AFP positive cells like HepG2 and Hep3B. Results: Both AFPp-E1A and Ad.AFPep-E1A could be selectively replicated in AFP positive cells and could be selectively inhibited AFP positive cells and the latter adenovirus was better. After using Ad. AFPp-E1A, the survival rates of HepG2 and Hep3B were (54.23\u00b17.13)% and (61.18\u00b112.63)% respectively. After using Ad. AF Pep-E1A, the survival rates of HepG2 and Hep3B were (26.65\u00b15.43)% and (24.49\u00b13.31)% respectively. Conclusions:We use the short AFP 800bp enhancer for the first time.It can enhance the activity of AFP promoter,at the same time, it provides more room to add more therapy gene for adenovirus package. Thereby,Ad.AFPep-E1A is a promising vector candidate for hepatocarcinoma targeting therapy.",

Analyzed factors included patient age at the time of injury, etiology of PFUI, type of emergency treatment, concomitant injuries, length and position of stricture, type of urethroplasty and the outcome of surgery. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied, together with analytical statistic methods such as t test and Chi-square test.The overall success rate of delayed urethroplasty was 80.6 %. Early realignment was associated with reduced stricture length and had beneficial effect on delayed surgery. Concomitant rectum rupture, strictures longer than 1.6 cm and strictures closer than 3 cm to the bladder neck were indicators of poor outcome. Age, type of injury, urethral fistula and bladder rupture were not significant predicators of surgery outcome. Failed direct vision internal urethrotomy and urethroplasty had no significant influence on salvage operation.The outcome of posterior urethroplasty is affected by multiple factors. Early realignment has beneficial effect; while the length and position of stricture and its distance to bladder neck plays the key role, rectum rupture at the time of injury is also an indicator of poor outcome. The effect of other factors seems insignificant.",

Methods One hundred and five patients with vascular erectile dysfunction (ED) were examined by duplex ultrasonography. Twelve arteriogenic ED caused by pelvic fracture trauma were examined using internal pudendal arteriogram . Patients with venogenic ED were examined using cavernosography. Papaverine and phentolamine were used for intracavernous injection. Results DU suggested that sixty-three patients were arteriogenic ED and forty-two patients were venogenic ED. IPA suggested that twelve arteriogenic ED patients caused by pelvic fracture trauma had artery injuries, including internal pudendal artery injury, right or left common penile artery injury only and both right and left common penile artery injuries. Cavernosography suggested that patients with venogenic ED had venous leakage, including deep dorsal vein leakage, crutal vein leakage,\u00b7leakage among corpus cavernosum and complicated leakage. Conclusion DU plays an important role in the diagnostic workup of patients with vascular ED. This accurate and reproducible method is useful to evaluate both arterial and venous hemodynamic abnormalities in patients with suspected vasculogenic ED. DU is the first-line test to define the vasculogenic ED. IPA is performed to confirm the location of arterial lesion. Cavernosography is performed to confirm the sites of leakage.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the transformation of epidermal cells from foreskin to reconstruct engineered anterior urethra with acellular collagen matrix. Methods: Acellular collagen matrices were generated from allogeneic rabbit bladder submucosa. In 12 rabbits, autologous foreskin epidermal cells were isolated, in vitro expanded and seeded (inoculation) onto the tubular acellular collagen matrix. In 12 male rabbits, urethral mucous defect was created and urethroplasty was performed with tubular acellular collagen matrix seeded with epidermal cells (n=12). Urethrography was performed at 1, 2, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. In addition, Urethras grafts were harvested and analyzed grossly and histologically. Results: Urethrography and gross views showed a patency of repaired urethral defect with the maintenance of a wide urethral caliber and without sign of strictures at any time points. Histology showed the graft seeded with epidermal cell had formed single layers structure by 1 month, which demonstrated the characteristic presence of a epidermal cells layer with a normal submucosa structure. At 2, 6 month postoperatively, histology showed multi-layers epidermal cells with vessel abundance in submucosa structure. Evidence margin between graft epidermal cells and epithelium cell lays of hostage were at 6 month postoperatively. Histology showed transitional cell lays with graft urethra and without evidence margin between graft and hostage urethra at 12 month postoperatively. Conclusion: As seed cells, epidermal cells seeded to acellular collagen matrix can reconstruct the urethra defect and transform to transitional cells structure finally.",

In this study, all patients underwent conventional urethrography after admission. Flexible cystoscopy was also used for comparison, followed by conventional urethrography. The flexible cystoscope was introduced into the posterior urethra and the area was evaluated for the length of the proximal urethra and any possible fistulas, false passages, calculi or displacement of the posterior urethra.Severe allergic reaction or obvious discomfort did not occur in any patients after conventional urethrography or flexible cystoscopy. By comparing the data obtained from flexible cystoscopy to those from conventional urethrography, no statistical difference was found in the measured length of the proximal posterior urethra (4.31 \u00b1 2.28 vs. 4.02 \u00b1 3.12, p > 0.05). However, the rate of detection in other abnormalities was higher in flexible cystoscopy than in conventional urethrography (48.3 vs. 10.8%, p < 0.05). Seventeen (14.2%), 9 (7.5%) and 32 (26.7%) patients were detected with fistula, false passage and calculus, respectively, according to flexible cystoscopy. In comparison, fistula, false passage and calculus were only observed in 2 (1.7%), 7 (5.8%) and 4 (3.3%) patients, respectively, through conventional urethrography imaging.Flexible cystoscopy is a valuable procedure in the evaluation of the posterior urethra and bladder neck, and in patients with urethral distraction defects before surgery. More details about fistulas, false passages, calculi and urethral defects could be obtained through this method.",

        "abstract": "To study the biocompatibility and neovascularization of the PLGA nanospheres wrapped with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which can improve bladder acellular matrix graft (BAMG) with local continuous release of VEGF.A total of 18 rabbit model (length of stenosis: 3 cm) with anterior urethral stricture were used as experimental animals and divided into three groups. Group A as the control group: Simple BAMG scaffold materials for urethral reconstruction. Group B as the blank group: PLGA microspheres modified BAMG for urethral reconstruction. Group C: PLGA conjugated with VEGF and modified BAMG for the urethral reconstruction. All rabbits underwent urethral angiography after 7 days, 15 days, 1 month and 3 months after the operation, and one rabbit in each group was sacrificed to be prepared for the organization histologic examination, HE staining, masson staining, CD31, 34 and a-SAM immunohistochemical detection in the repaired sites.In group A, significant urethral restenosis occurred in two rabbits after 15 days of the operation, HE and masson staining showed a lot of collagen arranged in the repaired sites, and there were a large number of inflammatory cell infiltration, and there were also CD31, 34 in the repaired sites. a-SAM microvascular tag count showed a small amount of microvascular; Group B showed anastomotic restenosis, HE and masoon staining showed inflammatory cell infiltration and collagen deposition; Group C: urethrography showed lumen patency. There were a small amount of inflammatory cell infiltration after 7 and 15 days after the operation, and there were also CD31, 34 in the repaired sites. The a-SAM microvascular tag count showed many microvascular. And the difference was significant.Anterior urethral reconstruction with sustained-release of VEGF by PLGA nanospheres modified BAMG stents can reduce postoperative restenosis. It can also reduce collagen deposition and scar formation, promote angiogenesis of the repair tissue; therefore it in valuable in the tissue-engineered urethral reconstruction.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To explore the effective treatment of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and bladder calculi. Methods:23 patients with BPH and bladder calculi underwent combined transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) and transurethral cystolithotripsy with holmium laser through resectoscope. Tailored ureteral catheter and Optical fiber of holmium laser was introduced into the bladder through the aisle of resectoscope, and cystolithotripsy with holmium laser. This was followed by TURP. Results:The procedure was successful in all 23 patients with complete stone clearance. The mean operating duration was from 30 to 80 minutes (mean, 56min), and the average operating duration for stone extraction was 9 minutes (range 3 to 20 min). No bladder perforation, no bladder bleed, no TURS was found. The urethral catheter was removed 3-5 days postoperatively. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 5. 6 days (range 4 to 9 days). The follow-up was from 3 to 18 months, neither stone recurrence nor urethral stricture were observed in all 23 patients. Conclusions:Simultaneous management for benign prostatic hyperplasia with bladder calculi through resectoscope has been shown to be easy to perform, and a quick, safe and effective, minimally invasive procedure. It also can be used to deal with large or multiple bladder stones, especially for patients with bladder bleeding.",

Tumor excision, epididymectomy, orchidoepididymectomy and radical orchidoepididymectomy with retroperitoneal lymph node dissection were used in 16, 8, 1, and 2 patients, respectively. Conclusions: B ultrasound plays an important role in diagnosis of primary epididymal tumor. Surgical exploration remains the first choice if primary epididymal tumor is suspected. If the tumor is benign, excision of the tumor or epididymectomy is sufficient. When histopathological diagnosis shows malignancy, radical orchidoepididymectomy with retroperitoneal lymph node dissection should be performed.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate occurrence of erectile dysfunction (ED) in patients with pelvic fracture urethral distraction defects (PF UDD) who underwent urethroplasty, and the efficacy of sildenafil citrate in treatment of these patients. Methods Erectile function of 41 patients with urethral stricture who suffered from PF UDD were assessed by IIEF-5. Assessments were made at 4 time points including at the time of prior to inj ury, two weeks after urethroplasty, and three months post-treatment with sildenafil. Pharmacopenile duplex ultrasonography (PPUD) was used to examine blood flow of the cavernosum for differential diagnosis of arterial erectile dysfunction (ED), venous ED and non-vascular ED. All patients were treated with oral sildenafil, 100 mg once daily, three times a week, for three months. Results The incidence of ED following injury was 95.12%. There were significant differences in the IIEF-5 scores pre and post injury. There were no significant changes in scores following surgery. It suggested that stricture location has no obvious influence on the severity of ED post-urethroplasty and that is, the longer the stricture the lower the score, these di erences did not reach statistical signiicance Sildenail had a success rate of approximately 81%, which might be independent of age. Drug treatment seemed most effective for those with less severe ED at the outset. There was no significant difference in scores post-treatment between those who had vascular or non-vascular ED. The incidence of total side effects due to sildenafil was 19. 5%. Conclusion Urethral trauma is frequently associated with ED. Sildenafil citrate is useful drug for treatment of ED in these patients and appears to be well tolerated.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate erectile function in patients with panurethral stricture after urethral reconstruction. Totally, 65 patients were enrolled. Different urethral reconstructions were performed according to the details of urethral strictures. The erectile function was evaluated before and after surgery. The length and location of stricture and duration from initial diagnosis to operation were recorded. The International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) scores, the quality of life (QoL) scores and the maximal flow rate were obtained before and 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. A significant improvement in QoL and maximal flow rate was observed 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery compared with those observed before surgery (P < 0.05). An impairment of erectile function was observed in patients with multi-site stricture 3 months after surgery (P < 0.05). Subsequently, these patients recovered 6 and 12 months after surgery. Three months after surgery, the IIEF-5 scores in patients with anterior urethral stricture were higher than those with multi-site stricture. Similar results were observed 6 and 12 months after surgery. No significant difference in age or duration from initial diagnosis to final operation was observed between patients with erectile dysfunction after surgery and patients with normal erectile function. However, a linear regressive relationship was detected between IIEF-5 scores and location of urethral stricture. Surgical reconstruction for treating panurethral strictures has limited effects on erectile function. The location of the stricture, particularly when extended to posterior urethra, was found to be associated with erectile function after surgery.",

Methods The clinical data of 310 cases of RCC confirmed by histology were retrospectively reviewed. All the 310 patients were classified into three groups: the \u226440 years group, the 40-60 years group and the \u226560 years group. The clinical presentation, pathological features, lymph node metastasis of the three groups were compared to explain the association. Results The incidence of incidental RCC was obviously lower in the \u226440 years group and the \u226560 years group than in the 40-60 years group (P=0.070, 0.047, respectively). The incidence of less differentiated RCC decreased with the increase of age(11.6% vs. 5.2% vs. 2.7%), and there was significant difference when the \u226440 years group and the \u226560 years group were compared (P=0.038). The incidence of lymph node metastasis also decreased with the increase of age and it was significantly higher in the \u226440 years group than in the other two groups (P< 0.05 ). The component ratio of clinical stages among the three groups was significantly different (P<0.01). With age increasing, the percent of stage\u2160decreased obviously. The percent of stage \u2161was obviously lower in the \u226440 years group and the percent of stage\u2160+\u2161 was obviously higher in the 40-60 years group. Conclusion The different percentages of incidental RCC are the major reason for the different component ratio of clinical stages in different age groups, while the different incidence of lymph node metastasis and less differentiated RCC are the minor reason.",

Afterwards, the cell-PGA complex was subjected to extension stimulation in a bioreactor for 5 weeks. A muscular tube of urethra was formed after 6 weeks. Histological examination showed differentiated ADSCs and collagenous fibers had orientated well.

Methods From Jun. 1987 to Dec. 2005, a total of 10100 patients with urinary calculi in the kidney or ureter accepted ESWL. The kidney stones were sorted by FDA standard. The ureteric stone was sorted by its site and retrograde pyelography. At the same time, we summarized the recurrence of kidney stone and its relationship between extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and hypertension. Results The efficacy for class I kidney stone was 91.2% that for class II 86.5% and class III 72.3%, the healing rate for ureteric stone was 84.5%. Combined retrograde pyelography and ESWL could improve the efficacy. If ESWL failed, the ureteric stone could still be removed by operation or ureterscopy (1.1%). The rate of recurrence of kidney stone was 6.1% and the incidence of hypertension post-treatment reached 7.9%. Conclusion ESWL is a preferred approach to treat urinary calculi.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To evaluate the the effect of end-to-end anastomotic urethroplasty on erectile function of traumatic urethral stricture patients.Methods:A total of 41 urethral stricture patients with PFUDD were evaluated with Pharmacopenile Duplex Ultrasonograpgy(PPUD) and International Index of Erectile Function-5(IIEF-5) pre and post end-to-end anastomotic urethroplasty respectively.These database were analyzed statistically.Results:Of all the 41 patients,there was a insignificant difference on IIEF-5 scores between preoperation and postoperation, and the patients whose erectile function didn't change significantly were in the majority,about 56%.In every age group,every stricture length group or every stricture location group,there was a insignificant difference on IIEF-5 scores between preoperation and postoperation;but there was a significant difference on stricture length among patients whose erectile function postoperatively improved,unchanged and decreased(2.16\u00b11.49 vs 2.28\u00b10.88 vs 3. 50\u00b11.53,P=0.0134);sand the difference was mainly between the decreased and the improved,or the decreased and the unchanged(P=0.0129,0.0165).The patients who had mild ED or mild to moderate ED had a significant decline on IIEF-5 scores after surgery(13.86\u00b11.88 vs 11.43\u00b13.37,P=0.0202),while the patients who suffered from moderate ED or severe ED had an insignificant change postoperatively on IIEF-5 scores.There was a significant difference on IIEF-5 scores of patients with non-vasculogenic ED between preoperation and postoperation (14.88\u00b11.81 vs 10.88\u00b14.02,P=0.0103);but of patients with arterial ED or venous ED,there was a insignificant difference on IIEF-5 scores between preoperation and postoperation.Conclusions:The erectile function of traumatic urethral stricture patients such as patients with PFUDD is little affected by end-to-end anastomotic urethroplasty. Some factors like stricture length and preoperative sexual function status will influence the patients' erectile function after surgery,while other factors like age of the patients and stricture location do not specifically relate to the change of erectile function.",

Methods: One case of bilateral Leydig cell tumor of testis was reported and related literatures were reviewed. Results: The patient was diagnosed as Leydig cell tumor based on clinical characteristics and examination Leydig cell tumor of testis was confirmed by frozen section pathological analysis during the operation. The patient underwent testicular tumor enucleation. No local recurrence or distant metastasis was detected during 6 months follow-up. Conclusion: Leydig cell tumor was a rare type of male testicular tumor. Diagnosis of this disease depended on pathological analysis. Traditional surgical method was radical orchiectomy. But for pre-adolescent patients with bilateral testicular Leydig cell tumor or single testis, especially their pathological grade was benign, tumor enucleation was a feasible and safe choice.",

Methods Between June 2005 and December 2006, 81 patients with large prostates (100~279 ml, mean 136.1\u00b131.6) were treated with bipolar plasmakinetic prostate resection(PKRP) combined with Photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP) by green laser. Two operative methods were adopted: PKRP was first applied and then PVP performed on the patients; In cases where there was perceivable angiectasis on the surface of prostate, PVP was first applied to stop bleeding before PKRP was performed on prostate and after that PVP was applied again. Results The mean operative time was 135 min (range, 90 ~180 min). Removing 54~180 of prostate (mean 82\u00b132g) took 90~180 min (mean 135 min). Intraopera-tive bleeding occurred in 4 patients and blood transfusion had to be carried out. All these patients had taken anticoagu-lant before operation. The catheters were removed 1~4 days after operation. The mean maximum urine flow rate before being discharged from hospital was 13.4 ml/s in those with catheters retension before operation and 16.8 ml/s in those without. Conclusion PKRP combine with PVP are safe, effective and minimally invasive for the treatment of large prostates. As far as short-time postoperative curative effect is concerned, it is less effective for those who had suffered urinary retention before operation than those who had not.",

No statistically significant differences were found in the expressions of HDAC1 and HDAC2 among those with different preoperative PSA levels and those of different ages (P > 0.05). Univariate analysis demonstrated that the HDAC2 expression, pre-operative PSA levels, Gleason scores and clinical stages of prostate cancer were important factors affecting the patients'survival (P < 0.05). Cox analysis indicated that the expression of HDAC2 was an independent index for the prognosis of prostate cancer (P = 0.017, HR = 2.265, 95% CI: 1.145 - 4.775).The increased expression of HDAC2 in prostate cancer can serve as an independent prognostic indicator, which has provided a theoretical base for the clinical application of HDACs in the diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer.",

We compared the above parameters between the two groups, screened the main factors that influenced the pathologic staging of prostate cancer by multivariate logistic regression analysis, and appraised the value of each of the parameters in predicting the pathologic stage of prostate cancer with a relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve.The tPSA level and biopsy Gleason score were significantly higher in Group A than in B (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that only tPSA could predict the pathologic stage of localized prostate cancer. The ROC curve exhibited that the combined use of tPSA and Gleason score had a better predicting value than other parameters (Gleason score + tPSA > tPSA > PSAD + tPSA + Gleason score).Total PSA remains a valuable predictor of the pathologic stage of prostate cancer, and its combination with Gleason score can further improve the predictive accuracy and contribute much to the treatment and prognosis of the disease.",

After CT scanning, a virtual cystourethroscopic view was software-generated. Conventional cystourethroscopy was also used before operation. The time durations of virtual cystourethroscopy and conventional cystourethroscopy were recorded. The accuracies of both techniques were compared using the actual findings from the operation.For 16 patients suffering from urethral strictures associated with various fistulas, the duration of examination with virtual cystourethroscopy was statistically significantly shorter than with conventional cystourethroscopy (P < 0.001). The detection rate of fistula by virtual cystourethroscopy was similar to than by conventional cystourethroscopy (P = 0.057). The same results were obtained in eight patients suffering from urethral strictures associated with false passages. Only virtual cystourethroscopy could reveal the details of the urethral lumen in nine patients suffering from long anterior urethral strictures caused by lichen sclerosus. By contrast, conventional cystourethroscopy failed in those same patients.CT virtual cystourethroscopy is a useful technique for the diagnosis of urethral disease, especially in male patients suffering from complex urethral strictures.",

TGF-\u03b21 and CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) signaling have been reported as the critical pathways involved in the pathology of fibrosis. Here, we collected the urine samples from the patients with recurring urethral stricture, recurring stricture treated by cystostomy, and age- and gender-matched healthy people. ELISA detection revealed that TGF-\u03b21 level was significantly up-regulated for the urethral stricture patients. By contrast, flow cytometry, real-time PCR detection, and immunofluoresecent staining showed that urethral stricture resulted in decreased expression of CXCR3. TGF-\u03b21 treatment could increase cell proliferation and migration ability of urethra fibroblasts, whereas IP-10/CXCR3 signaling showed the opposite effect. Further, we found a crosstalk between TGF-\u03b21 and CXCR3 signaling in the regulation of urethral fibrosis. Thus, pharmacological intervention of TGF-\u03b21 or CXCR3 signaling has a potential as the therapeutic target for the prevention of urethral fibrosis.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To explore the method of culture of rat adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and differentiation induction into myoblasts. Methods: Adipose tissues were obtained from SD rats, and were isolated by enzyme digestion and cultured into ADSCs. The expression of surface antigen CD90, CD105 and CD34 was detected by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. ADSCs of the second passage with logarithmic growth were obtained, and culture media containing 5-azacytidine (5-aza) and basic culture media were employed for cells in induction group and control group, respectively. The induction lasted for 7 d, 14 d, 21 d, 28 d and 35 d, respectively. Cell growth and cell morphology were observed by inverted phase contrast microscope, and immunofluorescence and flow cytometry were utilized to detect the expression of myoblast specific antigens desmin and myosin. Results: ADSCs were successfully isolated and cultured, and were identified to be stem cells. On the 28th day of induction, cells in induction group displayed \"swirl\" morpholgy, and multinucleation was observed. It was revealed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry that the highest expression rates of desmin and myosin were 52.57% and 50.04%, respectively on the 28th day of induction, while there was no expression before induction and in control group. Conclusion: ADSCs can be isolated and cultured from rat adipose tissues, and can further differentiate into myoblasts after induction by culture media with 5-aza. The expression of myoblast specific antigen is the highest on the 28th day of induction.",

        "abstract": "Cell-seeded scaffolds are a common route of cell transplantation for bladder repair and reconstruction. However, when cell suspensions are harvested, proteolytic enzymes often cause extracellular matrix damage and loss of intercellular junctions. To overcome this problem, we developed a bioengineered three-dimensional bladder patch comprising porous scaffolds and multilayered adipose-derived stem cell (ASC) sheets, and evaluated its feasibility for bladder regeneration in a rat model. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) were labeled with ultrasmall super-paramagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticles. ASC patches were constructed using multilayered USPIO-labeled ASC sheets and porous polyglycolic acid scaffolds. To monitor the distribution and localization of bioengineered bladder patches in live animals, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after transplantation. The bladder regenerative potential of ASC patches was further evaluated by urodynamic and histological analysis. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that cell sheets adhered tightly to the scaffold. MRI showed hypointense signals that lasted up to 8 weeks at the site of USPIO-labeled ASC sheet transplants. Immunofluorescence demonstrated that these tissue-engineered bladder patches promoted regeneration of urothelium, smooth muscle, neural cells and blood vessels. Urodynamic testing revealed that the ASC patch restored bladder function with augmented capacity. The USPIO-labeled ASC patch provides a promising perspective on image-guided tissue engineering and holds great promise as a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for bladder regeneration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Adipose-derived stem cell (ASC) sheets avoid enzymatic dissociation and preserve the cell-to-cell interactions and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which exhibit great potential for tissue regeneration. In this study, we developed a bioengineered three-dimensional bladder patch comprising porous scaffolds and multilayered ASC sheets, and evaluated its feasibility for bladder regeneration in a rat model. Tissue-engineered bladder patches restored bladder function and promoted regeneration of urothelium, smooth muscle, neural cells and blood vessels. Moreover, ultrasmall super-paramagnetic iron oxide (USPIO)-labeled bladder patches can be dynamically monitored in vivo by noninvasive MRI for long periods of time. Therefore, The USPIO-labeled bladder patch provides a promising image-guided therapeutic strategy for bladder regeneration.",

In this study, we found that let-7i-5p could regulate different cellular events in normal and pathogenic fibroblasts through three distinct signaling pathways. Interestingly, those regulations are compromised during the translation from mRNA to protein, and partially based on pathogenic status of the fibroblasts. By analyzing the molecular mechanism associated with its function, we conclude that let-7i-5p plays an essential role in regulating cell shape and tissue elasticity, cell migration, cell morphology and cytoskeleton, and could serve as a potential target for clinical treatment of urethral stricture patients.",

        "abstract": "Objective Urethral stricture is a common condition seen after urethral injury. The currently available treatments are inadequate and there is a scarcity of substitute materials used for treatment of urethral stricture. The traditional tissue engineering of urethra involves scaffold design, fabrication and processing of multiple cell types. Methods In this study, we have used 3D bioprinting technology to fabricate cell-laden urethra in vitro with different polymer types and structural characteristics. We hypothesized that use of PCL and PLCL polymers with a spiral scaffold design could mimic the structure and mechanical properties of natural urethra of rabbits, and cell-laden fibrin hydrogel could give a better microenvironment for cell growth. With using an integrated bioprinting system, tubular scaffold was formed with the biomaterials; meanwhile, urothelial cells (UCs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were delivered evenly into inner and outer layers of the scaffold separately within the cell-laden hydrogel. Results The PCL/PLCL (50:50) spiral scaffold demonstrated mechanical properties equivalent to the native urethra in rabbit. Evaluation of the cell bioactivity in the bioprinted urethra revealed that UCs and SMCs maintained more than 80% viability even at 7 days after printing. Both cell types also showed active proliferation and maintained the specific biomarkers in the cell-laden hydrogel. Conclusion These results provided a foundation for further studies in 3D bioprinting of urethral constructs that mimic the natural urethral tissue in mechanical properties and cell bioactivity, as well a possibility of using the bioprinted construct for in vivo study of urethral implantation in animal model. Significance of Statements The 3D bioprinting is a new technique to replace traditional tissue engineering. The present study is the first demonstration that it is feasible to create a urethral construct. Two kinds of biomaterials were used and achieved mechanical properties equivalent to that of native rabbit urethra. Bladder epithelial cells and smooth muscle cells were loaded in hydrogel and maintained sufficient viability and proliferation in the hydrogel. The highly porous scaffold could mimic a natural urethral base-membrane, and facilitate contacts between the printed epithelial cells and smooth muscle cells on both sides of the scaffold. These results provided a strong foundation for future studies on 3D bioprinted urethra.",

        "abstract": "Pelvic fracture urethral distraction defect (PFUDD) seriously affects the quality of life of patients. At present, there are few effective drug treatments available for PFUDD\u2011induced urethral stricture, which is associated with fibrosis and scar formation in urethra lumen. Emerging evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) may be involved in the regulation of fibrosis, and analysis of miRNA expression profiles in urethral scar and normal urethra tissues may therefore benefit the discovery of novel treatments for urethral stricture with micro invasive procedures. In the present study, miRNA sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) validation using paired scar and normal tissues from patients with PFUDD, and functional analysis of the miRNAs involved in the fibrosis associated signaling pathway was performed. A total of 94\u00a0differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in the scar tissue of patients with PFUDD. Among them, 26\u00a0miRNAs had significantly altered expression in the scar tissue compared with the normal tissue from the same patient. qPCR validation confirmed that miR\u2011129\u20115p was overexpressed in scar tissue. The TGF\u2011\u03b2 pathway\u2011associated functions of a total of 5 miRNAs (hsa\u2011miR\u2011129\u20115p, hsa\u2011miR\u2011135a\u20115p, hsa\u2011miR\u2011363\u20113p, hsa\u2011miR\u20116720\u20113p and hsa\u2011miR\u20119\u20115p) were further analyzed, as well as their key molecular targets and functional mechanisms in signaling regulation. To conclude the miRNA sequencing indicated a significantly altered expression of hsa\u2011miR\u2011129\u20115p, hsa\u2011miR\u2011135a\u20115p, hsa\u2011miR\u2011363\u20113p, hsa\u2011miR\u20116720\u20113p and hsa\u2011miR\u20119\u20115p in patients with PFUDD. These miRNAs and their potential target genes were associated with fibrosis in several diseases, and the data from the present study may help explore potential miRNA targets for future precision treatments for urethral stricture.",

        "abstract": "Macrophage activation and persistent inflammation contribute to the pathogenesis of spinal cord injury (SCI), and different phenotypes of macrophages play diverse roles in the pathological process of SCI. After SCI, there is an acute phase of alternatively activated (M2) macrophage infiltration, followed by a long-lasting phase of classically activated (M1) macrophage accumulation in the wound. The long-lasting predominance of M1 macrophages may derail healing and compromise organ functions. Based on the previous findings that the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) up-regulates genes associated with M1 macrophages, we attempted to examine the effect of silencing IRF5 on SCI progression. IRF5 expression was assessed with Western blotting or immunohistochemistry. Macrophage phenotypes were measured with flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry. M1- or M2-related cytokines were measured with a Luminex assay kit. IRF5 siRNA was delivered into the macrophages infiltrated into the wound of SCI mice through lipidoid nanoparticle. Locomotor functions were measured with Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) scoring. Myelination was assessed with luxol fast blue staining. Myelin binding protein, neurofilaments, synaptic markers, and cytokines in the wound area were measured with Western blotting. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analyses. After SCI, significant elevation of IRF5 was evident on day 1, peaked on day 7, and gradually decreased thereafter. Similar dynamic change in the expression of CD86, a typical M1 marker, was observed. In contrast, there was a transient increase in the expression of CD206, a typical M2 marker, which peaked 6\u00a0h after SCI, and returned to baseline within 1\u00a0day. Macrophages isolated from the epicenter at day 3 after SCI were predominantly M1 phenotype, and a siRNA-mediated knockdown of IRF5 resulted in a reduced expression of M1 macrophage markers and increased expression of M2 macrophage markers. Nanoparticle-mediated delivery of IRF5 siRNA to SCI mouse model resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of M1 macrophages and a significant increase in the number of M2 macrophages in the wound. This was associated with a robust inflammation resolution, attenuation of demyelination and neurofilament loss, and significant improvement of locomotor function (p\u2009<\u20090.05). IRF5 may serve as a therapeutic target to promote post-SCI recovery. ",

        "abstract": "Purpose:  To investigate the therapeutic effect and mechanism of action of Gengnian Jianshen Decoction (GJD) on ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in rats.   Methods:  Female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to a sham-operated group (control), and five ovariectomy (OVX) sub-groups, that is, OVX with vehicle (OVX), OVX with Xianling Gubao capsule (positive control drug, 120 mg/kg/day), and OVX with GJD doses (70, 140, and 280 mg/kg/day). The treatments were given orally daily for 16 weeks (starting 4 weeks after the rats were subjected to ovariectomy. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the L4 vertebrae and right femur of each rat was estimated. Serum levels of estradiol (E2), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF-1) of rats in all the groups were determined using ELISA.   Results:  The results showed that GJD dose-dependently inhibited BMD reduction in L4 vertebrae and femur, and significantly increased serum E2, FSH and LH levels ( p  u003c 0.05) in the osteoporotic rats. Moreover, GJD significantly decreased serum IL-6 levels and increased levels of IGF-1 ( p  u003c 0.05).   Conclusion:  These findings indicate that GJD prevents OVX-induced osteoporosis in rats without hyperplastic effects on the uterus. Thus, GJD has potential for use in the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis.   Keywords:  Gengnian Jianshen decoction, Osteoporosis, Ovariectomy, Bone mineral density",

        "abstract": "Based on the two-echelon supply chain structure of newsboy-type-product, this paper relaxes the assumption that the market demand is certain, and introduces a decision variable-ordering quantity. We investigate the manufacturer's and retailer's optimal advertising strategies, retailer's optimal ordering strategies of the Stackelberg leader-follower game and Nash co-op game respectively, and compare the strategies selection and system expected profits in the two game equilibrium. Meanwhile, we discuss the restraint effect of demand uncertainty on advertisement expenditures of the manufacturer and the retailer. Then the Nash bargaining model is utilized to determine the allocation of the co-op profit. Finally, a numerical example is given to confirm the relevant conclusion.",

Meanwhile, we improved the iteration step length to obtain a numerical optimization algorithm which had better convergence and stability compared with the BHHH algorithm. Conclusions supported by the empirical analysis of Shanghai composite index are: The models overcome the shortcomings of traditional GARCH theory in discovering the information of multi-time scales contained in the price, and capture the volatility characteristics of the return in different time scales; It is obviously effective to use the improved algorithm to estimate the models parameter. The above models may help to explore the micro dynamic mechanism of asset price with the transaction cycle evolution.",

        "abstract": "On the basis of building exogenous risk index system of financial opening, this paper proposes a 3\u03b4 principle, which assesses the exogenous risk of financial opening, and a neural network model of early risk warning. The results of the analysis based on the data of the risk indexes of China\u2019s financial opening show that the current risk level of China\u2019s financial opening is in a safe state. The assessment and early warning of exogenous risks of 26 developing countries\u2019 financial opening show that the principles and early warning model are practical and feasible to a certain extent. Therefore, the paper suggests that the administration should transfer current compliance regulation to focusing on the exogenous risk of financial opening, establish a scientific and effective assessment and early warning system for financial opening, and adjust and reform the financial regulatory system to adapt to financial globalization.",

        "abstract": "It is the first time the authors introduce the organizational ecology into banks competition analysis. It indicates that using the theory of ecology population to study on bank population competition is feasible by an analysis between biology population and bank population. Then this paper proposes a Lotka-Volterra competition model between Chinese bank and foreign bank. This model could discuss and analyze the influence of the technological spillover effects and competition effects to the competition equilibrium. Finally,it uses a non-balance panel data to those theory results and gives policy recommendations. By discussing the stabilization condition of operation scale of Chinese bank population and foreign bank population,it shows that it is necessary to control the spillover effects and competition effects among bank population and pay attention to the differential management of bank population for forming stable and concordant banking market structure.",

To test the MAS efficiency of KC1 for Bph18(t), the F_2 plants derived from the cross between Yangdao 6(i.e.9311)[without Bph18(t), susceptible to BPH] and C4064 [harboring Bph18(t)] were subjected to both bioassay of BPH resistance in the field and molecular identification with the STS marker KC1 in the laboratory. Among the F_2 plants, 292 plants were resistant to BPH while the other 84 plants were susceptible, indicating a single gene [Bph18(t)] controlling the BPH resistance in the F_2 population. The results of molecular identification showed that the MAS efficiency of KC1 for Bph18(t) was 82.6%, indicating that the STS marker KC1 could be useful to trail Bph18(t) gene in rice breeding program.",

Some accessions of Oryza eichingeri (2n = 24, CC) from Africa confer strong resistance to brown planthopper (BPH), whitebacked planthopper (WBPH) and bacterial blight (BB). In the present study, restriction fragments length polymorphism (RFLP) and simple sequence repeats (SSR) analysis were performed on disomic backcross plants between Oryza sativa (2n = 24, AA) and O. eichingeri in order to identify the presence of O. eichingeri segments and further to localize BPH-resistant gene. In the introgression lines, 1 - 6 O. eichingeri segments were detected on rice chromosomes 1, 2, 6, or/and 10. The dominant BPH resistant gene, tentatively named Bph13(t), was mapped to chromosome 2, being 6.1 and 5.5 cM away from two microsatellite markers RM240 and RM250, respectively. The transfer and localization of this gene from O. eichingeri will contribute to the improvement of BPH resistance in cultivated rice.",

Furthermore, the changes in resistance of IR26 and IR36 to BPH, soluble sugar and oxalic acid contents in 25-day-old rice plants of susceptible variety TN1 and resistant varieties IR26 and IR36 were detected at five temperatures (22\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, 31\u00b0C and 34\u00b0C). IR26 completely lost resistance both in greenhouse and at the five tested temperatures. IR36 still had moderate resistance at natural temperature, but its resistance decreased gradually when the temperature increased from 25\u00b0C to 34\u00b0C, and fully lost its resistance at 31\u00b0C and 34\u00b0C. The highest durable resistance of IR26 and IR36 were recorded at 25\u00b0C. The soluble sugar content in plants of the three tested rice varieties increased with temperature increase, and the oxalic acid content increased with the temperature increase at first, maximized at 25\u00b0C, and then declined. Two-way ANOVA indicated significant effects of temperature and rice variety on contents of soluble sugar and oxalic acid in rice plants.",

In the present study, restriction fragments length polymorphism (RFLP) and simple sequence repeats (SSR) analysis were\n performed on disomic backcross plants betweenOryza sativa (2n = 24, AA) andO. eichingeri in order to identify the presence ofO. eichingeri segments and further to localize BPH-resistant gene. In the introgression lines, 1\u20136O. eichingeri segments were detected on rice chromosomes 1, 2, 6, or/and 10. The dominant BPH resistant gene, tentatively named Bph13(t),\n was mapped to chromosome 2, being 6.1 and 5.5 cM away from two microsatellite markers RM240 and RM250, respectively. The transfer\n and localization of this gene fromO. eichingeri will contribute to the improvement of BPH resistance in cultivated rice.",

        "abstract": "With global warming,the northern overwintering limits of the migratory rice pests,Nilaparvata lugens( St\ue560l) \u3001 Sogatella furcifera( Horv\u00e1th) and Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Guen\u00e9e in China may move further north. We investigated the actual overwintering boundaries of these pests by sampling potential overwintering rice fields in the early spring of 2008\u3001 2010 and 2011 in south China according the national standard of rice planthopper and rice-leafroller investigation criteria( GB/T 15794-1995 and GB/T 15793-1995). Based on this investigation,we conclude that the overwintering boundaries of all three pests were similar to those previously reported in the 1970- 1980. Through comparison of variation in monthly mean temperature between the winters of 2008\u30012010\u30012011 and 1978- 1981,we found that the mean temperature of January 2010 was above average whereas that in 2008 and 2011 were below average. Therefore,these three year's data can not reflect the true effect of global warming on these three pest's northern overwintering boundary.",

        "title": "The effects of rice growth stages on the ovarian development and take-off of Nilaparvata lugens and Sogatella furcifera",
        "abstract": "The brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens (St\u00e5l)) and white-backed planthopper (Sogatella furcifera (Horv\u00e1th)) represent two of the most important insect pests of rice in Asia, causing severe damage to rice production. Both belong to long-distance migratory insects but differ in the time when they reach maximum density during rice-growing season. S. furcifera generally reaches its peak of occurrence when rice is before the filling stage; while N. lugens reaches its peak at the rice filling stage. It is possible that the same rice stage might impact the two planthopper species differently, thus leading to such a seasonal difference in population growth. To test this, we inoculated newly-emerged adults onto rice plants at each of the three developmental stages, i. e., early tillering stage (about 40-d old, with 2-3 tillers), jointing stage (about 60-d old, the longest internode < 2 cm) and booting-to-heading stage (about 75-80-d old). The level of ovarian development and take-off rate were then measured daily from the 2 nd to the 5 th day and from the 1 st to the 5 th day after emergency, respectively. Ovarian development from 2 nd to the 5 th day was largely dominated by grade I, II, III and IV, respectively, with three exceptions including the 4d- (dominated by grade II) and 5d-old S. furcifera females (grade III) at booting-to-heading stage plants, plus the 5d-old S. furcifera females (grade II) at jointing stage plants. For ovarian development in N. lugens females, in vast majority of the cases the three rice stages showed comparable proportion of females at each of the detected ovarian development grades, we only observed significant difference between early tillering stage (73. 2% of the females at grade IV) and booting-to-heading stage (89% at grade IV) on the 5 th day. In contrast, the grade of ovarian development displayed much larger differences among the three rice stages for both 4d-and 5d-old S. furcifera females. In particular, over 86% of the females from rice early tillering stage developed into grade III on the 4 th day and into grade IV on the 5 th day, versus less than one quarter of the females from the booting-to-heading stage. To a similar extent, the ratio of females at grade III was 4. 2:1 between jointing stage and booting-to-heading stage on the 4 th day, along with a ratio of up to 6. 8:1 between early tillering stage and jointing stage for the 5d-old females at grade IV. As for the take-off rate, while little variation was seen for N. lugens across the three rice stages, noticeable differences were revealed for 1d-, 4d- and 5d-old S. furcifera adults, with early tillering stage being constantly associated with the lowest take-off rate and booting-to-heading stage with the highest take-off rate. Thus, our results demonstrated a profound effect on the development of S. furcifera by a change of rice stage, as compared to relatively limited effect on N. lugens development. Furthermore, among the three rice stages, early tillering stage is most favorable and booting-to-heading stage is least favorable for S. furcifera development, a trend appearing to be reversed in N. lugens. Taken together, our analysis offers a plausible explanation for why the peak of S. furcifera comes before that of N. lugens.",

        "abstract": "Rice sheath blight caused by Rhizoctonia solani is one of the most devastative diseases worldwide,which causes serious yield loss under favorable environmental conditions.R.solani has a very wide host range and the rice germplasm with complete resistance to this disease is zezo.Sheath blight resistance is generally controlled by polygene,with a wide variation among rice cultivers.It is necessary to evaluate probably partial resistance to sheath blight from germplasms for rice breeding program.A total of 166 indica hybrid rice combinations collected from 11 provinces in southern China were inoculated by using five isolates with different pathogenicities at seedling stage in the greenhouse.No combination was found to be completely immune or highly resistant,and the resistance to sheath blight varied significantly among different combinations.Average disease index of these combinations were in accordance with normal distribution N(5.27,0.682) and ranged from 2.84 to 7.64.The results showed that this inoculation method at seedling stage was simple,rapid,uniform,and allowed to distinguish minor differences in susceptibility,so it can be used for a large-scale screening or primary resistance identification.According to the disease index of each isolate,166 combinations were classified into five types based on dynamic clustering analysis(DCA),namely resistant(R),moderately resistant(MR),moderately susceptible(MS),susceptible(S),and highly susceptible(HS),accounting for 1.20%,13.86%,36.14%,43.37%,and 5.42%,respectively.The discriminant functions for each type were calculated based on Bayes method,and the accuracy rate for discrimination reached 96.39%.The results indicated that most of the combinations were susceptible.Only two combinations,K you 88 and Zhongyou 9801,were resistant,but should be verified at the adult stage in paddy field.Synthetic disease index(SDI) of all combinations was also calculated by average disease index of the five isolates,the combinations were graded as R,MR,MS,S,and HS based on SDI,accounting for 1.20%,13.25%,63.25%,21.69%,and 0.60%,respectively.There was significant correlation between the results of DCA and SDI(r = 0.81,P < 0.01),showing that both methods can be used for evaluating the disease resistance.But the former method is suitable for seedling screening under the uniform growth conditions;while the latter is independent of time,place and batch of the identification,and more versatile than the former.Only 26 combinations with resistance or moderate resistance to sheath blight were gained by DCA and SDI,the genetic distances ranged from 0.04 to 0.71.Twenty six combinations were divided into two groups by UPGMA cluster analysis,and 22 out of them were grouped into a group with the narrow genetic background at genetic distance of 0.36.There was a close relationship among the parents of the 26 combinations according to the pedigree tracing.Therefore,the practical strategy for rice resistance breeding to sheath blight is further to broaden genetic bases of germplasm,pyramid quantitative resistance genes,construct hybrid combinations with parents having desirable traits and resistance to sheath blight.",

        "abstract": "The effects of transgenic rice containing both cry1Ac and CpTI genes on survival of the stripped stem borer (SSB), Chilo suppressalis, and the pink stem borer (PSB), Sesamia inferens, and the field composition of stem borers were studied in both laboratory and field tests. The laboratory bioassay results showed that the survival of SSB and PSB on transgenic rice was significantly lower than that on non-transgenic control. The toxicity of transgenic rice to SSB and PSB declined at the late growing stage of rice. The lethal effect of the transgenic rice to SSB was stronger than that to PSB. As for SSB, only a few larvae (0.5%-6.4%) could survive at the 4th day after infestation at the heading and maturity stage in transgenic rice, and the survival rate of PSB on transgenic rice was higher than that of SSB. Furthermore, there were a few larvae (<1.6%) could pupate and emerge although the pupation and emergence rates were substantially lower than those on non- transgenic control. The results of field tests in both early and late rice indicated that the number of SSB and PSB larvae on transgenic rice were significantly reduced compared with the control. Compared with non-transgenic check, the number of SSB in transgenic rice was reduced by over 99%, and the effect of transgenic rice on PSB was relatively low and varied with different cropping seasons. The number of PSB was decreased by over 93% in early rice and by 44%-64% in late rice. Among the surviving stem borers in transgenic rice field, the percentage of PSB increased significantly. It is inferred that the change is possibly caused by the different susceptibilities for the two stemborers to transgenic rice expressing Cry1Ac and CpTI toxins.",

This GM rice line is likely to be approved in China in the near future. In this study, we estimated the insert number of foreign genes, analyzed the flanking sequences of T-DNA in rice genome, and presented an event-specific detection method for this line. The results show that the foreign gene inserted one copy between position 11,774 and 11,805 of chromosome 11 (AC120536.5) in Kefeng-8 genome. Based on these inserts and border sequences, the event-specific qualitative and quantitative PCR system was established for Kefeng-8. The qualitative detection limit was assessed to be 0.1%, and the limit of quantitative method was assessed to be 100 initial template copies. Two mixed rice sample with known Kengfeng-8 contents were used to verify the quantitative method, from which the expected results were observed. This study provides a reliable method and information for detection, identification, and quantification of the presence of GM rice Kefeng-8.",

        "abstract": "The development and commercialization of transgenic rice with novel traits in China may offer more opportunities for promoting rice productivity. Owing to the significance of rice as a major food crop in China, the enhancement of rice production is important for national food security. If left unaddressed, the po- tential biosafety concerns over the extensive release and commercial cultivation of transgenic rice may ham- per the development and application of this technology in rice improvement. Biosafety issues include: (1) ef- fects of toxic transgenes on non-target organisms; (2) transgene escape to crops or wild relatives through gene flow and its potential ecological consequences; (3) interactions and influences of transgenes and trans- genic plants on biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and soil microbes; and (4) the development of resistance to insect- or disease-resistant transgenes in target organisms. In order to safely and sustainably utilize transgenic biotechnology in rice, it is very important to assess biosafety consequences, including environmental risks, from transgenic rice. This paper presents a rational analysis of potential environmental biosafety problems based on the principles of risk assessment, provided that transgenic rice will be released for commercializa- tion. We hope these analyses will provide useful information for the decision-making on commercialization of transgenic rice and serve as a framework for the assessment of relevant environmental biosafety risks.",

To understand field performances of GE rice, key\n agronomic traits of two insect-resistant Bt rice lines that have been granted biosafety certificates for commercial production in China were evaluated together with\n their nontransgenic counterparts under environmental conditions with significant differences in insect pressure. Results from\n the experiments showed enhanced field performances of the Bt GE rice lines compared with the non-GE counterparts for yield-related traits such as number of panicles and filled seeds\n per plant, under environmental conditions with no insecticide application. No detectable underlying cost of the Bt transgene was observed in the two insect-resistant GE rice lines, particularly in the GE hybrid rice line. Results further\n indicated significantly greater yield performances of the two insect-resistant GE rice lines under environmental conditions\n with non-target insect control compared with no insect control. It is concluded from this study that insect-resistant Bt GE rice, particularly the hybrid line, has great potential to maintain its high yield when ambient insect pressure is high.\n In addition, proper application of insecticides to control non-target insects will guarantee optimal performance of insect-resistant\n Bt GE rice.",

In general the dominant species was N. muiri at early stage, but N. lugens at late stage. However, population development patterns among the five sites varied. The percentages of N. lugens in the two sites of Guangxi were 60.4% to 91.3%, but those of N. muiri in Linxiang, Hunan and Fuyang, Zhejiang were 59.3% to 80.7%. N. lugens started to appear under light trap in April, became dominant in June and showed two peaks at June-July and October (or October-November) in the two sites of Guangxi, but started to appear under light trap in May-June, became dominant in September, and showed only one peak at September-October in the other three sites. Therefore, it is very important to identify specimens caught under light trap for improving brown planthopper forecasting.",

The results are as following: 1. SMVS was only emitted by co-living males. This SMVS behavior was, while closely associated with density and age of males, also influenced by environmental temperature and the existence of females. 2. In the course of courtship and mating the males emitting SMVS became increasingly dominant with 70.2% successful mating, males with no SMVS, however, showed only 14.9% 3. The percentage of mated N. lugens was (45.7 \ufffd\ufffd 18.3)% with the playback of the SMVS record, which was much lower than those with no playback signal (CK) or playback of female vibrational signal (FVS) and first male vibrational signal (FMVS). The playback of SMVS, on the other hand, had no obvious influence on the percentage of S. furcifera mated. The results indicated that SMVS is a species-specific competitive reproductive signal of N. lugen.",

Virulence in three host related populations of BPH, which had been reared on rice variety TN1, Mudgo and ASD7 for 82 generations respectively, were studied with honeydew excretion and weight gain of female adult tested in 48 h. Virulence of BPH from avirulent BPH population (TN1 population, most individuals are avirulent), were significantly weaker than that from virulent BPH populations (Mudgo or ASD7 populations, most individuals are virulent). So, crosses and backcrosses were conducted between avirulent and virulent population to study the genetic model of virulence of BPH. In honeydew excretion testing, the results showed that the mean honeydew excretion of famale adults was significantly different in reciprocal cross populations (F- 1 populations), which indicated that there were obvious differences in the virulence of these populations. The same result was obtained with the index of weight gain. The above results suggest that the inheritance of virulence of the brown planthopper may be sex-linked.",

        "abstract": "Although rice (Oryza sativa L.) lines that express Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins have shown great potential for managing the major Lepidoptera pests of rice in southern China, including Sesamia inferens, their long-term use is dependent on managing resistance development to Bt toxins in pest populations. The maintenance of \"natural\" refuges, non-Bt expressing plants that are hosts for a target pest, has been proposed as a means to minimize the evolution of resistance to Bt toxins in transgenic plants. In the current study, field surveys and greenhouse experiments were conducted to identify host plants of S. inferens that could serve as \"natural\" refuges in rice growing areas of southern China. A field survey showed that 34 plant species in four families can be alternative host plants of S. inferens. Based on injury level under field conditions, rice (Oryza sativa L.); water oat (Zizania latifolia Griseb.); corn (Zea mays L.); tidalmarsh flatsedge (Cyperus serotinus Rottb.); and narrow-leaved cat-tail (Typha angustifolia Linn.) were identified as the primary host plant species of S. inferens. Greenhouse experiments further demonstrated that water oat, corn, and narrow-leaved cat-tail could support the survival and development of S. inferens. Interestingly, greenhouse experiments showed that S. inferens preferred to lay eggs on tidalmarsh flatsedge compared with the other three nonrice host species, although no pupae were found in the plants examined in field surveys. Few larvae were found to survive on tidalmarsh flatsedge in greenhouse bioassays, suggesting that tidalmarsh flatsedge could serve as a \"dead-end\" trap crop for S. inferens, but is not a candidate to serve as natural refuge to maintain susceptible S. inferens. Overall, these results suggest that water-oat, corn, and narrow-leaved cat-tail might serve as \"natural refuge\" for S. inferens in rice planting area of southern China when Bt rice varieties are planted.",

        "abstract": "To determine the distribution and dynamic excretion of metal elements, the test insects, adults of the Sogatella furcifera (Horv\u00e1th) were subjected to feeding on deionized water for 0 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 96 h, respectively. The body weight changes were measured and the contents of twelve metal elements (Cu, Zn, Cd, Mn, Ca, Fe, Na, As, U, Mg, K and Pb) in S. furcifera were detected using ICP-MS technique. At the same time, we denote the entire body weight, the organic tissue weight, the weight of the intestinal contents and their excretion rate of S. furcifera by W, O, E and r, respectively. The body weight of S. furcifera at different time can be expressed by the modified exponent equation Wt=O+E(1-r)t. Considering the content of a certain element in S. furcifera (WCt) should be the sum of the content of that element in the organic tissues (OC) and in the intestinal contents (EC), the statistical model is WCt=OC\u00b7OPt+EC\u00b7EPt, where OPt is the percentage of O to body weight at time t and EPt is the percentage of E. The results of simulation modeling showed that the contents of Cu, Zn, Cd, Mn and Ca are significantly higher in the organic tissues than those in the intestinal contents (P<0.05), suggesting that these elements can be absorbed or accumulated by organic tissues. The contents of seven elements (Fe, Na, As, U, Mg, K and Pb) have no significant difference between in the organic tissues and in the intestinal contents (P>0.05), suggesting that the contents of these elements in the organic tissues are balanced with those in the intestinal contents and their contents in insect body are not significantly changed. The simulation modeling method can provide reference to other studies involving metal distribution, accumulation and excretion in other small or micro-insects.",

        "abstract": "The effects of host plants on survival and activities of detoxification and protective enzymes of three rice planthoppers(Nilaparvata lugens,Sogatella furcifera and Laodelphax striatellus) were investigated with five host plants including four rice varieties [TN1,IR42,Rathu Heenati(RHT) and Wuyujing 3] and one weed barnyardgrass.The survival rate of the three planthoppers significantly varied with host plants.N.lugens had the highest survival rate on TN1,followed by on IR42 and Wuyujing 3,and on RHT and barnyardgrass.However,S.furcifera and L.striatellus had significantly higher survival rate on TN1 as well as on Wuyujing 3 and barnyardgrass,and substantially lower survival rate on RHT and IR42.Among the three planthoppers,the activities of glutathione S-transferase and microsomal mixed-function oxidases at the adult stage,and the activities of carboxylesterase,superoxide dismutase and peroxidase at both adult and nymph stages,significantly differed on various host plants,whereas the activities of glutathione S-transferase and microsomal mixed-function oxidases were similar at the nymph stage.The influence of host plants on the activities of these enzymes were also planthopper-related,with L.striatellus most affected,N.lugens the least affected,and S.furcifera moderately affected,which was in accordance with the host range of these planthoppers.However,it was also found that,even if the planthoppers fed on plants with similar host fitness,the enzyme activities varied among planthopper species,or even between the adult and nymph stages within a planthopper species.It is suggested that relations between the host plant fitness and the activities of detoxification and protective enzymes differed with species and developmental stage of planthoppers,and also with the type of host plants.",

        "abstract": "Because of the magnitude of the losses to rice production caused by the brown planthopper(BPH,Nilaparvata lugens(St\ue329l)),and the resistance of BPH to chemical insecticides,the frequency of BPH outbreaks,breeding of insect resistant rice varieties,insecticide resistance monitoring,development of new pesticides,new ecological management technologies,prediction technologies and the integration and demonstration of sustainable pest management technologies were investigated in central,southern and eastern China and other representative regions.The results show that BPH collected from Vietnam,Laos and southern China were mainly biotype \u2161,with the next most common biotype being biotype \u2162.Paddy field microclimate was the key factor for BPH escaping high temperature,as morning temperature increased,a large number of BPH moved to within 20 cm of the rice base to thereby minimizing the adverse effects of high temperature.Different methods of transplanting rice seedlings had a great influence on the densities of BPH;BPH densities in handed-planted rice fields were the highest,followed by those in machine-planted rice fields,with densities in direct seeded rice fields the lowest.The abundance of BPH in super hybrid rice was obviously higher than in conventional hybrid rice and high levels of nitrogen promoted BPH occurrence.Furthermore,there was an interactive effect between different rice varieties and nitrogen levels with regard to BPH abundance.BPH in China have high resistance to imidacloprid(168.1-561.5),low to moderate resistance to buprofezin(4.2-33.1) and are sensitive to slightly resistant to nitenpyram and chlorpyrifos.Four effective pesticides with low toxicity to humans were selected from those sold on the current market;Thiamethoxam,Pymetrozine,Nitenpyram and Fenobucard.We developed three kinds of new compound pesticides,one of which has been officially registered by the Ministry of Agriculture's Pesticide Quarantine Institute,and has been produced on a large scale.The other two new compound pesticides are currently undergoing the pesticide registration process.The BPH resistant genes BPH6,BPH7,BPH9,BPH15,BG1222 have been finely mapped in rice,and their close co-segregation molecular marker identified.A new rice variety,Guangliangyou 476,containing the BPH resistance gene BPH14,was cultivated,with high yield,high quality and appropriate maturity.A large number of parental rice lines containing multi-resistant polymerization genes have already been cultivated.This project developed a set of eco-control technologies,such as seasonal planting regimes,planting soybeans on the edge of rice fields to attract the natural enemies of BPH,and the use of parasitic wasps or spiders to control BPH.Three biological repellents to BPH feeding and oviposition and one attractant of BPH's parasite wasp,Anagrus nilaparvatae,were extracted from plants.An environmentally friendly integrated control system was established,and applied in Hunan,Hubei,Guangdong,Guangxi,Zhejiang,Jiangxi Provinces.This project has the potential to provide economic,ecological and social benefits.",

        "abstract": "Transgenic rice to control stem borer damage is under development in China. To assess the potential of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) transgenes in stem borer control, the toxicity of five Bt protoxins (Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry1Ba and Cry1Ca) against two rice stem borers, Sesamia inferens (pink stem borer) and Chilo suppressalis (striped stem borer), was evaluated in the laboratory by feeding neonate larvae on artificial diets containing Bt protoxins. The results indicated that Cry1Ca exhibited the highest level of toxicity to both stem borers, with an LC(50) of 0.24 and 0.30 microg/g for C. suppressalis and S. inferens, respectively. However, S. inferens was 4-fold lower in susceptibility to Cry1Aa, and 6- and 47-fold less susceptible to Cry1Ab and Cry1Ba, respectively, compared to C. suppressalis. To evaluate interactions among Bt protoxins in stem borer larvae, toxicity assays were performed with mixtures of Cry1Aa/Cry1Ab, Cry1Aa/Cry1Ca, Cry1Ac/Cry1Ca, Cry1Ac/Cry1Ba, Cry1Ab/Cry1Ac, Cry1Ab/Cry1Ba, and Cry1Ab/Cry1Ca at 1:1 (w/w) ratios. All protoxin mixtures demonstrated significant synergistic toxicity activity against C. suppressalis, with values of 1.6- to 11-fold higher toxicity than the theoretical additive effect. Surprisingly, all but one of the Bt protoxin mixtures were antagonistic in toxicity to S. inferens. In mortality-time response experiments, S. inferens demonstrated increased tolerance to Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac compared to C. suppressalis when treated with low or high protoxin concentrations. The data indicate the utility of Cry1Ca protoxin and a Cry1Ac/Cry1Ca mixture to control both stem borer populations.",

These three assumptions are:(1) Bt-engineered crops must produce a high dose of Bt insecticidal protein to kill most heterozygotes; (2) Initial frequency of alleles conferring resistance in target pest species must be rare; (3) Susceptible adults that survived in refuges are expected to intermingling and mating with resistant adults that survived in Bt fields. We reviewed theoretical and empirical results related to these assumptions,and focused on the recent advances in random mating assumption and presented some new theoretical outcomes resulted from modeling researches. We also discussed the direction of upcoming researches and related techniques briefly.",

        "abstract": "Rice stripe disease,transmitted by the rice small brown planthopperLaodelphax striatellus Fall\u00e9n(Homoptera: Delphacidae),has been a severe devastating disease in Northern Zhejiang,China since 2004.To understand the relation of rice grain yield loss to the incidence of the disease and the density of the vector,a series of experiments were conducted from 2004 to 2006 in rice fields.The results showed that the incidence of the disease(Y1) at the seedling stage increased with the increasing density of infectious vector(X2) as the equation of Y1=0.0873 + 1.0757X2,while the rice yield loss(Y,%) increased positively in a linear mode with the incidence(X,%) in the single-cropping late rice asY=0.1254 + 0.7551X.The economic injury level(EIL) was calculated as 2.0%-2.5% of yield loss according to the current economic scenarios for rice production for the control of the disease.Therefore the economic threshold for controlling the disease was set as the density of 2-3 per square meter of the small brown planthopper in the seedling nursery and at the early stage in rice fields.Such economic threshold has been practically applied in control of the disease in large scale fields and a significant economic benefit has been achieved.",

They were characterized by shorter plant height, decreased spikelets per panicle, longer panicle and anther, and larger spikelets, in comparison with the original F1 hybrid. They were also self fertile, although somewhat low, with seed set ranging from 2.72% to 3.55% in H1 and from 4.29% to 4.72% in H2. The meiotic analysis further revealed the chromosome configuration at MI of E13 and E24, being 0.69 I +23.54 II +0.06 IV and 0.59 I +23.36 II +0.14 IV, respectively. The invariable chromosome numbers (2n=48) and the similar morphological traits in H2 and H3 generations led to the conclusion that these two amphiploids had a relatively high genetic stability.",

Thereafter,we described the relation of sexual pressure of each sex. female and male have different strategies to access a mating because of different efforts and input on their offspring. In general,male insects are eager to mate as many as females,or try to make him to be accepted by many females. In contrast,female insects choose the best male to mate,or females have a right to choose who is acceptable. Consequently,male insects evolved many kinds of strategies to access mating chances. On the other side,female insects can gain material benefits,besides for genetic benefits,through their choices. These strategies and benefits of insects were then described and discussed.",

        "abstract": "Adult stage resistances to the brown planthopper (BPH),Nilaparvata lugens (Sta\u3002l) of six rice varieties with different seedling resistances were evaluated in Fuyang,Zhejiang Province,China. The six varieties were Shanyou 63(with Bph1 gene),IR42(with bph2 gene),IR56 (with Bph3 gene),TN1 (susceptible control) and two newly-bred hybrid rice combinations Zhongzheyou 1 and Guodao 6. The rice varieties with moderate resistance or high resistance to BPH at the seedling stage showed resistance at the adult stage. And the varieties highly susceptible at the seedling stage were susceptible at the adult stage. However,the time and degree for hopperburn in field were some different among those susceptible varieties. Hopperburn occurred five days later on Zhongzheyou 1 than on TN1,even if the resistance degrees of those two rice varieties were both at 9 in seedling screening. This suggests that Zhongzheyou 1 had obvious tolerance to BPH which cannot be detected in seedling screening. Therefore,the emphasis should be paid on screening of the adult stage resistance further for new rice varieties which were susceptible at the seedling stage and had good grain quality and (or) high yielding.",

        "abstract": "This study reports the identification of splice variants for the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II () gene from , , and . CaMKII is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase that transduces Ca signals in cells to control a range of cellular processes in the nervous system and muscular tissue. Sequence analysis showed that CaMKII was 99.0% identical at the amino acid level among three rice planthoppers, with the exception of a variable region located in the association domain. Four kinds of 20-81 amino acid \"inserts\" were found in the variable region. The phylogenetic tree of the deduced amino acid sequences showed that the NlCaMKII isoforms were more closely related to the LsCaMKII isoforms and were slightly distinct from SfCaMKII. CaMKII-E was the dominant type among the five main isoforms.  genes were constitutively expressed in various nymphal and adult stages and in tested tissues with the predominant transcription occurring in the head. There was no major tissue specificity of isoform expression, but the expression pattern and relative abundance of isoforms varied when compared with the RT-PCR between tissues. In addition, RNAi in  with dsRNA at a concentration of 200 ng nymph induced a mortality of 77.7% on the 10th day and a reduction in the mRNA expression level of 67.2%. Unlike the holometabolous insect , the knockdown of  did not suppress the expression of 20E response genes, such as , , and , in . These results indicate that the role of CaMKII in hemimetabolous insects may be different from that in holometabolous insects.",

The nontarget effects of two Bt rice lines T2A-1 (Cry2A rice) and T1C-19 (Cry1C rice) on six brown planthopper populations with geographical, virulent, and resistant variations were evaluated. Populations differed significantly in relation to brown planthopper nymphal survival, nymphal duration, and female adult weight. T2A-1 and T1C-19 did not affect the ecological fitness parameters of brown planthopper compared with the parental non-Bt rice MH63. Both esterase and glutathione-S-transferase activities differed between brown planthopper populations. Esterase activity of some brown planthopper populations was significantly affected by the rice lines. It is important to take account of these findings in management ofnontarget brown planthopper in Cry2A or Cry1C rice in the future.",

        "abstract": "The conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play vital roles in plant defense responses against pathogens and insects. In the current study, the expression profiles of 17 s were determined in the TN1 and IR56 rice varieties under the infestation of brown planthopper (BPH), one of the most destructive hemimetabolous rice pests. The virulent IR56 BPH population (IR56-BPH) and the avirulent TN1 BPH population (TN-BPH) were used to reveal the roles of s in the compatible (IR56-BPH infested on the TN1 and IR56 rice varieties, and TN1-BPH infested on the TN1 rice variety) and the incompatible (TN1-BPH infested on the IR56 rice variety) interaction. The statistical analysis revealed that rice variety, BPH population type, and infestation period have significant effects on the transcription of s. Out of these genes, five s (, , , , and ) were found to exhibit upregulated expression only during incompatible interaction. Six s (, , , , , and ) were associated with both incompatible and compatible interactions. The transcription analysis of salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene phytohormone signaling genes revealed their roles during the rice\u207bBPH interactions. The upregulated expression of , , and  in the incompatible interaction implied the potential defense regulatory roles of phenylpropanoids. In both varieties, the elevated transcript accumulations of  and , and the increased enzyme activities of POD, SOD, and GST at 1 day post-infestation (dpi), but not at 3 dpi, indicated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling might be an early event in rice\u207bBPH interactions. Furthermore, upregulated transcription of  and  was found only during an incompatible interaction, suggesting their involvement in the BPH resistance response in the IR56 rice variety. Lastly, based on the findings of this study, we have proposed a model of interactions of IR56 rice with TN1-BPH and IR56-BPH that depicts the resistance and susceptibility reactions, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Twenty-nine cDNAs encoding Ras-like family small GTPases (RSGs) were cloned and sequenced from Nilaparvata lugens. Twenty-eight proteins are described here: 3 from Rho, 2 from Ras, 9 from Arf and 14 from Rabs. These RSGs from N.lugens have five conserved G-loop motifs and displayed a higher degree of sequence conservation with orthologues from insects. RT-qPCR analysis revealed NlRSGs expressed at all life stages and the highest expression was observed in hemolymph, gut or wing for most of NlRSGs. RNAi demonstrated that eighteen NlRSGs play a crucial role in nymphal development. Nymphs with silenced NlRSGs failed to molt, eclosion or development arrest. The qRT-PCR analysis verified the correlation between mortality and the down-regulation of the target genes. The expression level of nuclear receptors, Kr-h1, Hr3, FTZ-F1 and E93 involved in 20E and JH signal pathway was impacted in nymphs with silenced twelve NlRSGs individually. The expression of two halloween genes, Cyp314a1 and Cyp315a1 involved in ecdysone synthesis, decreased in nymphs with silenced NlSar1 or NlArf1. Cyp307a1 increased in nymphs with silenced NlArf6. In N.lugens with silenced NlSR\u03b2, NlSar1 and NlRab2 at 9th day individually, 0.0% eclosion rate and almost 100.0% mortality was demonstrated. Further analysis showed NlSR\u03b2 could be served as a candidate target for dsRNA-based pesticides for N.lugens control.",

        "abstract": "Metamorphosis is a crucial process in insect development. Ecdysone-induced protein 93 (E93) is a determinant that promotes adult metamorphosis in both hemimetabolous and holometabolous insects. Kruppel-homolog 1 (Kr-h1), an early juvenile hormone (JH)-inducible gene, participates in the JH signaling pathway controlling insect metamorphosis. In the current study, an E93 cDNA (NlE93) and two Kr-h1 cDNA variants (NlKr-h1-a and NlKr-h1-b) were cloned from Nilaparvata lugens (Stal), one of the most destructive hemimetabolous insect pests on rice. Multiple sequence alignments showed that both NlE93 and NlKr-h1 shared high identity with their orthologs from other insects. The expression patterns revealed that decreasing NlKr-h1 mRNA level was correlated with increasing NlE93 mRNA level and vice versa. Moreover, RNAi assays showed that the knockdown of one of these two genes resulted in significantly upregulated expression of the other. Correspondingly, phenotypical observation of the RNAi insects revealed that depletion of NlE93 prevented nymph\u2013adult transition (causing a supernumerary nymphal instar), while depletion of NlKr-h1 triggered precocious formation of incomplete adult features. The results suggest that Nlkr-h1 and NlE93 are mutual repressors, fitting into the MEKRE93 pathway. The balance between these two genes plays a critical role in determining the proper timing for activating metamorphosis of N. lugens during the nymphal stage.",

Nilaparvata lugens harbors an ascomycete Entomomyces delphacidicola that hypothetically biosynthesizes several amino acids to meet the nutrition requirement of the planthopper. Among these amino acids, here, we focused on arginine biosynthesis. A complete cDNA of an E. delphacidicola gene, arginine-succinate lyase, EdArg4, the last step in arginine biosynthesis, was obtained. RNAi-mediated suppression of EdArg4 reduced arginine content in the hemolymph, and decreased the expression of several arginine biosynthesis genes. Silencing of EdArg4 delayed nymphal development and led to nymphal lethality. About 20% of the EdArg4 RNAi surviving adults were deformed. The most obvious defect was wider and larger abdomen. The EdArg4 RNAi-treated planthoppers had thickened wings and enlarged antennae, legs, and anal tubes and a few adults did not normally emerge. Arginine deficiency in the EdArg4 RNAi planthoppers repressed nitric oxide signaling, determined at the transcriptional level. We infer that E. delphacidicola biosynthesizes essential arginine to compensate for nutrition deficiency in N. lugens.",

Bacteria of the genera Acinetobacter, Serratia, and Arthrobacter were present in all brown planthopper individuals analyzed. The infection frequency (IF) of Arsenophonus in brown planthopper reared on the rice variety \u2018Taichun Native1\u2032 was higher than that observed with the \u2018Mudgou0027 and \u2018ASD7\u2032 varieties. The IF of Arsenophonus increased by 50% when the planthoppers were reared on Taichun Native1 for u003e15 generations, unrelated to the origin of that population of planthoppers. The IF of Wolbachia, however, declined when the brown planth...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In the brown planthopper  Nilaparvata lugens , introduction of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) successfully knocks down genes transcribed in several types of tissues. However, whether RNA interference (RNAi) can effectively reduce the transcripts of neuronally-expressed genes remains undetermined. In the present paper, we selected three neuronally-expressed genes respectively encoding prothoracicotropic hormone ( NlPTTH ), pigment-dispersing factor ( NlPDF ) and short neuropeptide F ( NlsNPF ). The transcripts of the three genes were detectable throughout all tested developmental stages, and were mainly restricted to the nervous system of  N. lugens . We introduced dsRNA originated from each of the three neuronally-expressed genes at a dose of 300\u00a0ng into the nymphal body cavity by microinjection. The target mRNA was successfully knocked down. Moreover, silencing of  NlPTTH  downregulated the transcripts of two ecdysteroidogenesis genes ( NlPHM  and  NlDIB ), and surpressed the expression of an ecdysone-response genes ( NlFTZ-F1 ). Furthermore, RNAi of  NlPTTH  caused typical 20-hydroxyecdysone deficient phenotypes: nymphal development was delayed and nymphal lethality occurred. In addition, injection of a series of ds NlsDPF  solutions at the doses of 300, 60, 12, 2.4 and 0.5\u00a0ng into the fourth-instar nymphs decreased its target transcript in a dose-dependent manner: the mRNA levels reduced by 94%, 86%, 57%, 33% and 29%, respectively. Therefore, delivery of dsRNA by microinjection can effectively repress the transcripts of the neuronally-expressed genes in  N. lugens.",

        "abstract": "Urban socio-economic development and spatial urban expansion has led to the loss and fragmentation of habitat. Global climate change adds to the gravity of these effects. An ecological network describes a network of habitats and connecting corridors that is mapped using habitat suitability and land use/ land cover data. Connectivity within a habitat network ensures a flow of material, energy and information among the various patches, and allows species-movement from inappropriate to appropriate areas. This ensures the abundance of species reaches a dynamic equilibrium at the network level and also means that the disappearance of species from any particular patch does not change the function of the regional ecosystem network. Thus, management of ecological network is an effective measure to counter the loss of biodiversity caused by reductions in habitat quality and area, as well as habitat fragmentation, in the context of rapid urbanization and climate change. The least cost path method is a way to construct and analyze ecological networks based on landscape spatial structure and dynamic biological processes. Based on the understanding that the characteristic of the matrix is one of the important factors determining the movement of species between patches, the least cost path method gives different cost values to different landscape types, and generates a cost surface to substitute the Euclidean space. Therefore, the dispersal paths generated by the least cost method are similar to those of actual species movement. Qingdao city is located in the eastern coastal region of China where the economy is relatively well-developed. The region is also where marine and terrestrial ecosystems meet. In this paper, we propose a wetland ecological network in the Qingdao district based on remote sensing and geographic information systems technology. We evaluate the overall structure of the network and the importance of individual patches using the correlation length index and betweenness centrality index, and use the findings to identify optimal strategies and make recommendations. In this paper, we discuss the following five questions: (1) How to classify landscapes? (2) How to determine the cost value of each landscape type? (3) How to evaluate the importance of each core patch? (4) How to evaluate the importance of stepping stones? (5) What is optimal management strategy for the wetland systems in the study area? The result shows that the network connectivities are very different in terms of threshold levels of path cost. Core patches in Jiao Zhou bay wetlands and Da Gu river have a relatively high degree of importance. Stepping stone patches with a high degree of importance are found in two zones: one comprising Jiao Zhou bay, Jiao Lai river and Wei He river estuary, and the other comprising Jiao Zhou bay and Ding Zi bay. In this paper, we propose a wetland management plan based on an ecological network including one core area, two axes and a ring in Qingdao and its surrounding area, to provide a scientific and quantitative basis for the selection of urban development sites within Qingdao City that simultaneously achieves wetland ecosystem protection. These network construction and evaluation methods can be used for other ecological network analysis.",

        "abstract": "Urban socio-economic development and urban spatial expansion has led to the loss and fragmentation of habitat. Global climate change adds to the gravity of these effects. The survival of wildlife species is subjected to enormous pressure due to natural environmental changes and human activities. Agent-based models (ABMs) are computer simulation models analyzing and simulating human or animal behavior through the integration of learning, adaptation, evolution and logical analysis. ABMs study the overall system characteristics by analyzing internal elements of the system (such as the interaction among individual agents, and agents with the environment) with a bottom-up approach. The agents in ABMs can complete given objectives, perceive and respond to changes of the external environment through the default logic control, and respond to stimuli from other agents and the external environment through learning and adaptation functions. This paper designed an agent-based evaluation model of an ecological pattern, which was used to analyze the impact of different woodland patterns on species survival and dispersal. The model focused on the logic control of survival and dispersal of agents, and used the dispersal strategy integrating CRW and LW models, which combines the advantages of these two models. The survival of the agent is control by the age-specified U-shaped survival curve and determination function considering their own energy and environmental risks. The model was developed on the GIS platform, realizing the seamless integration of the agent model and GIS, which could then be applied to real geographical environment simulation. Qingdao is a city located in the eastern coastal region of China where the economy is relatively well-developed. The region is also where marine and terrestrial ecosystems meet. Woodland is mainly distributed in the Laoshan Mountains in the east, the Daze Mountains in the north, and the Dazhu, Xiaozhu and Tiejue Mountains in the south. In the study area, the ecological environment is deteriorating, and various wildlife species are being impacted, with some species being endangered or facing extinction. This paper selected the woodlands in the Qingdao district as the study object, analyzing the effect of different spatial patterns on the survival and spread of woodland species. Simulation results showed that, compared with the original state, species populations and migration have improved significantly under different levels of ecological network framework, and the higher the level of ecological network framework, the more obvious the improvement. The distance between patches had a large influence on the dispersal of simulated species because they were not able to arrive at patches that were far away from the original patch. Therefore, this paper makes the suggestion that an approach integrating wetland and woodland systems could strengthen woodland system functional contact in the study area. It is suggested that the region around Jiaozhou Bay and the mainstream of Dagu River be used to increase the spatial distribution of woodland. Based on the simulation results, suggestions for the woodland ecological pattern construction are given below: (1) ensure that the large woodland can not be destroyed; (2) the wetland system district in the middle of Qingdao is an ideal place for a new woodland construction; (3) the ecological network framework can be used as a spatial reference for an ecological barrier to prevent the spread of urban land into woodland.",

In FFT-based MIMO array imaging algorithms, rearrangement in wavenumber domain to reduce dimension is implemented which has low efficiency and restricts the sampling steps in spatial frequencies. This paper proposes a novel wavenumber domain imaging algorithm based on spherical wave decomposition. This algorithm uses FFT to transform the measurements into wavenumber domain for compensation, and then the spectrum is retransformed to reconstruct image by FFT and coherent accumulation. It avoids the rearrangement operation and preserves the high efficiency of the FFT-based method, and can be implemented for transmitting and receiving arrays of different length. The imaging performance is demonstrated by simulation.",

Based on the geometry model on the sea surface, a novel extended target multipath tracking algorithm is proposed under the random finite sets (RFS) framework. In the algorithm, extended target probability hypothesis density (ET-PHD) filter is used as a pre-processor, and multipath Bernoulli filter (MPBF) is used as main processor. The outputs of the ET-PHD filter are treated as pseudo-measurements and fed into the MPBF. At last, probability of existence and target state are estimated from the outputs of MPBF. In contrast with the existing extended target filter and multipath filter, the proposed algorithm does not attempt to get the rigorous solution and avoids the high computational complexity. In order to get the solution of the algorithm, its particle filter implementation has been proposed. Results of simulation show that the proposed algorithm estimates target state accurately. Comparing with extended target Bernoulli filter, the proposed algorithm has good tracking performance at the presence of multipath effect.",

The LSSVDD method not only inherits the advantage of LSSVM model, which owns low computational complexity with linear equality constraints, but also overcomes the shortcoming of poor capacity of variable targets in SVDD. Similar to the LSSVM, the distribution information within classes is found by least square method and applied for adjusting the boundary in LSSVDD, which relieves the over-fitting of SVDD. Hence, there will be a remarkable improvement in classification accuracy and generalization performance. Numerical experiments based on several publicly UCI datasets and HRRPs of four aircrafts are taken to compare the proposed method with other available approaches, and the results especially for multiple targets can demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method. The LSSVDD is ideal for HRRP-Based radar target recognition.",

However, the fractal differences between target and sea clutter are not probably significant due to the fact that target echo has been corrupted by clutter. The time-frequency distribution generated by Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) indicates that the spectrum of target echo is mainly distributed near zero frequency, which is different from the spectrum of sea clutter. In order to enhance the difference of fractal characteristics between target and clutter, this paper applies Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), the first procedure of HHT, to extract the lower frequency components of radar raw echo. Then, Hu rst exponent is used to construct the fractal detector. Simulation results using real data show that the performance of this new algorithm is better than the raw data-based Hurst-exponent method and the EMD-based box -dimension method.

        "abstract": "Inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) can form two-dimensional (2D) electromagnetic images of a target, but it cannot provide the third dimensional information about the target. Conventional 3D turntable ISAR imaging requires data collection over densely azimuth-elevation samples, which needs a large amount of data storage. In this study, an effective 3D ISAR imaging algorithm for turntable model based on compressive sensing is proposed, which exploits the sparsity in the image domain to achieve 3D reconstruction by using a limited number of measurements. Firstly, the 3D data tensor is converted into a 2D matrix by stacking slices of data along one specific dimension; then a 2D optimisation reconstruction approach is applied to solve a sparsity-driven optimisation problem to obtain the 2D distribution of the scatterers. Lastly, 3D ISAR images are generated by rearranging the scatterer distribution in the 2D map into a 3D volume. This imaging scheme only needs a small number of measurements, and reduces the required memory and computational burden significantly. Simulation results are finally shown to validate the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Waveform sets with good correlation and/or stopband properties have received extensive attention and been widely used in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar. In this paper, we aim at designing unimodular waveform sets with good correlation and stopband properties. To formulate the problem, we construct two criteria to measure the correlation and stopband properties and then establish an unconstrained problem in the frequency domain. After deducing the phase gradient and the step size, an efficient gradient-based algorithm with monotonicity is proposed to minimize the objective function directly. For the design problem without considering the correlation weights, we develop a simplified algorithm, which only requires a few fast Fourier transform (FFT) operations and is more efficient. Because both of the algorithms can be implemented via the FFT operations and the Hadamard product, they are computationally efficient and can be used to design waveform sets with a large waveform number and waveform length. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithms can provide better performance than the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the computational complexity.",

Compared with other radar waveforms, OFDM has a thumbtack ambiguity function and the spectrum can be elaborately designed through changing the complex weights transmitted over different subcarriers. First, the optimal waveform design algorithm based on maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the output receiver is introduced and the analytic expression of the waveform with optimal energy spectral density (ESD) is also derived. Then, combining the characteristic of OFDM waveform, a cycle iterative algorithm (CIA) based on fast Fourier transform (FFT) is proposed to search for the optimal solution of the objective function. Numerical examples show the ESD of designed waveform matches the optimal ESD well and the detection performance is also improved by optimizing the frequency weights of transmitted waveform.",

Abundant research has focused on the fractal properties of long time sequence or the whole power spectrum of sea clutter, while ignoring the local characteristics of multifractal spectrum. This paper firstly proves the multifractal properties of sea clutteru0027s power spectrum theoretically by using FBM (Fractional Brownian Motion) model, and then the multifractal properties of sea clutteru0027s power spectrum are verified by random multiplicative model and real-collected data as well. It is found that there exists a huge difference between the pure sea clutter and the sea clutter with targets in the multifractal spectra of their power spectra, especially in the local part. This enables us to propose a detection method based on MSS-LMP (Mean Square Summation of Local Multifractal spectrum of Power spectrum). Compared with existing detection methods based on fractal geometry and traditional CFAR (Constant False Alarm Rate) respectively, the proposed method demonstrates a better detection performance.",

The final image is obtained by coherent accumulation of all subimages. This method does not take the plane wave approximation and can be applied in short-range imaging scenes. It has the same imaging accuracy as the backprojection algorithm but greatly reduces the computational load. Both two- and three-dimensional imaging experiments verify its performance.",

Realistic physical and statistical effects such as refraction of the lower atmosphere and the Earth\u2019s curvature are incorporated into the multipath propagation model. Then, we derive a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector by taking advantage of the frequency diversity of OFDM and MIMO configuration.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Traditional pulse Doppler radar estimates the Doppler frequency by taking advantage of Doppler modulation over different pulses and usually it requires a few pulses to estimate the Doppler frequency. In this paper, a novel range-Doppler imaging algorithm based on single pulse with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) radar is proposed, where the OFDM pulse is composed of phase coded symbols. The Doppler frequency is estimated using one single pulse by utilizing Doppler modulation over different symbols, which remarkably increases the data update rate. Besides, it is shown that the range and Doppler estimations are completely independent and the well-known range-Doppler coupling effect does not exist. The effects of target movement on the performances of the proposed algorithm are also discussed and the results show that the algorithm is not sensitive to velocity. Performances of the proposed algorithm as well as comparisons with other range-Doppler algorithms are demonstrated via simulation experiments.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the recognition rate comparison for competing recognition algorithms, which is a common problem of many pattern recognition research areas. The paper firstly reviews some traditional recognition rate comparison procedures and discusses their limitations. A new method, the posterior probability calculation (PPC) procedure is then proposed based on Bayesian technique. The paper analyzes the basic principle, process steps and computational complexity of the PPC procedure. In the Bayesian view, the posterior probability represents the credible degree (equal to confidence level) of the comparison results. The posterior probability of correctly selecting or sorting the competing recognition algorithms is derived, and the minimum sample size requirement is also pre-estimated and given out by the form of tables. To further illustrate how to use our method, the PPC procedure is used to prove the rationality of the experiential choice in one application and then to calculate the confidence level with the fixed-size datasets in another application. These applications reveal the superiority of the PPC procedure, and the discussions about the stopping rule further explain the underlying statistical causes. Finally we conclude that the PPC procedure achieves all the expected functions and be superior to the traditional methods.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Sparse frequency waveform (SFW) is widely used in wideband systems (for instance, radar and communication systems) to suppress the narrowband interferences or avoid the reserved frequency bands. However, it suffers high autocorrelation sidelobes due to the discontinuous spectrum. In this paper, we aim at designing waveforms with low autocorrelation sidelobes and arbitrary frequency stopbands. After formulating this design as an unconstrained minimization problem, two algorithms based on the majorization\u2013minimization method and a gradient-based algorithm are derived to deal with this problem. The proposed algorithms can be easily implemented by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) operations and thus are computationally efficient for long waveform design with good sidelobe and stopband suppression. In addition, they can handle both the design problem of low sidelobe waveform and the design problem of sparse frequency waveform with low sidelobes. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithms can provide better performance than the existing ones on the running time.",

This is proposed to be due to the competitive rates of radical recombination and thiyl radical degradation, and has implications on the choice of monomer (as monomer propagation requires re-initiation of the oligomeric/polymeric RAFT agent). These findings can provide guidelines and increase understanding when conducting a photopolymerization employing thiocarbonylthio RAFT agents.",

The attractive features of this photopolymerization system, including high end-group fidelity at (near) complete monomer conversion, are exploited to facilitate a high-yielding, one-pot pathway toward well-defined star polymer products. Moreover, reinitiation of the photoactive trithiocarbonate moieties from within the star core is demonstrated to form (pseudo)miktoarm stars via an \u201cin\u2013out\u201d approach, showing extremely high initiation efficiency (95%).",

This is investigated in the current study, where a significant \u201cphotoenhancement\u201d is observed for most cases under typical RAFT reaction conditions, indicating that fume hood lights can contribute to the generation of radicals in RAFT reactions. Given the observed emission spectrum of a typical fluorescent light source, the photoenhancement is proposed to occur through a visible light activation pathway. These findings are crucial for ensuring maximum reproducibility of controlled polymerizations conducted in the presence of typical sources of irradiation encountered in a standard chemical laboratory.",

The following three approaches were used: (i) one-pot cationic RAFT block polymerization and the simultaneous cross-linking reaction of divinyl ether; (ii) mechanistic transformation to radical RAFT block polymerization and the simultaneous cross-linking reaction of a hetero divinyl monomer, which possesses both vinyl ether and acrylate moieties; and (iii) one-pot cationic RAFT selective block copolymerization of the vinyl ether moiety in the hetero divinyl monomer, followed by mechanistic transformation to a radical cross-linking reaction of the acrylate moiety that remained in the pendant groups of the diblock polymer. All three methods were free from metal catalysts and produced core cross-linked star polymers with controlled molecular weights (Mw = 2\u20136 \u00d7 105), narrow molecular weight distributions (Mw/Mn = 1.1\u20131.4), and controlled arm numbers (Narm = 15\u201340) and sizes (Dn = 18\u201328 nm, Dw/Dn = 1.03\u20131.06) in relatively high yields (80\u201394%).",

The production of linear polyacrylate and polyacrylamide has been achieved via PET-RAFT polymerization using g-C3N4 as a photoactive organocatalyst without prior deoxygenation. The resulting polymers display controlled molecular weights, narrow polymer dispersities, and high end-group fidelity as exemplified by 1H NMR analysis, MALDI-TOF-MS measurement, and chain extension experiment. Temporal control is illustrated by intermittent light and dark cycles, with polymer growth arrested in the absence of irradiation. The effects of changing RAFT agents (i.e., trithiocarbonates), solvents, catalyst concentrations, and degrees of polymerization in this system have been investigated. The successful polymerization of nonpurified monomer (i.e., still containing radical inhibitors) demonstrates the robust nature of the presented PET-RAFT system.",

        "abstract": "Novel cisplatin (CDDP)-loaded, polypeptide-based vesicles for the targeted delivery of cisplatin to cancer cells have been prepared. These vesicles were formed from biocompatible and biodegradable maleimide-poly(ethylene oxide)114-b-poly(L-glutamic acid)12 (Mal-PEG114-b-PLG12) block copolymers upon conjugation with the drug itself. CDDP conjugation forms a short, rigid, cross-linked, drug-loaded, hydrophobic block in the copolymer, and subsequently induces self-assembly into hollow vesicle structures with average hydrodynamic diameters (Dh) of \u223c270 nm. CDDP conjugation is critical to the formation of the vesicles. The reactive maleimide-PEG moieties that form the corona and inner layer of the vesicles were protected via formation of a reversible Diels\u2013Alder (DA) adduct throughout the block copolymer synthesis so as to maintain their integrity. Drug release studies demonstrated a low and sustained drug release profile in systemic conditions (pH = 7.4, [Cl\u2013] = 140 mM) with a higher \u201cburst-like\u201d release rate being observed under late endosomal/lysosomal conditions (pH = 5.2, [Cl\u2013] = 35 mM). Further, the peripheral maleimide functionalities on the vesicle corona were conjugated to thiol-functionalized folic acid (FA) (via in situ reduction of a novel bis-FA disulfide, FA-SS-FA) to form an active targeting drug delivery system. These targeting vesicles exhibited significantly higher cellular binding/uptake into and dose-dependent cytotoxicity toward cancer cells (HeLa) compared to noncancerous cells (NIH-3T3), which show high and low folic acid receptor (FR) expression, respectively. This work thus demonstrates a novel approach to polypeptide-based vesicle assembly and a promising strategy for targeted, effective CDDP anticancer drug delivery.",

The simultaneous control over the molecular weight, side-chain tacticity, and architecture allows the macromolecule to stereocomplex with the complementary linear stereoregular polymers (i.e., isotactic PMMAs) in controlled manners. By modulating the feed ratio of the complexing materials and chain length of the linear assembling component, a variety of crystalline materials with different sizes and morphologies, including discrete spherical nanoparticle, multiple-particle assembly, and cross-linked network structure, can be produced. Among these, uniformed sized, stable nanocrystals that exhibit temperature-induced solution assembly and disassembly properties can be derived from a combined process of PMMA triple-helix stereocomplex formation and polymer architecture-directed intramolecular crystallization.

The measured electrophoretic mobility of the fractionated single sheets ranges from\u00a0\u22120.2 to\u00a0\u22121.4\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0cm/V\u00b7s where the interpreted zeta potentials vary from\u00a0\u22123\u00a0mV to\u00a0\u221217\u00a0mV with increasing sheet size. The single GO sheets show auto-fluorescence in the visible range of 350\u2013650\u00a0nm using an excitation wavelength of 200\u00a0nm. Furthermore, the GO nano-sheets functionalized using PEG are found to be non-cytotoxic in in-vitro at concentrations up to 90\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, with a small reduction in cell viability\u00a0\u221210%- at 260\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. The observed concentration-dependence of the cytotoxicity potentially explains the differing conclusions on cytotoxic potential reported in the literature. The GO nano-sheets therefore have the potential to be used as fluorescent drug delivery carriers of specific size.",

Gels were chemically cross-linked through the amine residue of a polycationic polylysine-b-polyvaline block copolymer with glutaraldehyde as cross-linker under cryogenic conditions. These cryogels exhibited excellent water swelling and highly compressible mechanical properties owing to their macroporous structure. The antibacterial performance was evaluated based on E. coli viability, with cryogels exhibiting up to 95.6% reduction in viable E. coli after a brief 1 h incubation. In comparison to the hydrogel control, the presence of macropores is shown to be vital to the antimicrobial effect of the gels. The confined environment and increased antimicrobial surface area of the macropores is believed to result in a \u201ctrap and kill\u201d mechanism. Mechanical strength and pore integrity of cryogels were also found to be determinants for antibacterial activity. Along wi...",

        "abstract": "A new top-down approach to generate stable nanoscale films via catalyst induced cross-linking (CIC) is demonstrated. Polymers with various compositions and bearing pendent norbornene groups (defined as macrocross-linkers) are initially spin-coated onto substrates to form nanometre-thick films; when the films are brought into contact with a catalyst solution, ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP)-mediated cross-linking efficiently occurs to lock the film into place. CIC provides a new paradigm for the fabrication of stable nanoscale films and provides an alternative to traditional methods that use external stimuli (e.g., heat or light) to trigger film cross-linking. The process requires short cross-linking times (u003c3 min) to generate covalently bonded and stable nanoscale films. This facile nanoengineering approach allows for the creation of complex multi-layered and multi-compositional patterned films, enables excellent control over film properties such as thickness and swellability, and provides access to nanoscale free-standing polymer sheets. To highlight the versatility of the CIC approach, cross-linked, nanostructured and stratified multi-layered films with tunable film thickness were prepared from norbornene functionalised poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate), poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) macrocross-linkers. CIC proceeds at low catalyst concentrations and allows the catalyst solution to be recycled multiple times, as demonstrated through repetition of 10 individual CIC cycles, making the process economical, scalable and applicable to advanced manufacturing techniques. Furthermore, the technique can be used to produce patterned films through selective exposure of specific regions of the polymer film to the catalyst solution. The CIC approach mediated by ROMP is highly efficient, rapid, robust and versatile, providing new opportunities in film assembly, and complementing existing nanoscale film fabrication methodologies.",

        "abstract": "Antifogging and frost-resistant coatings can be used in a wide range of applications and enable high light transmission through substrates even under changes in environmental conditions. In this study, surface confined and cross-linked antifogging thin films are fabricated on glass slides via catalyst induced cross-linking (CIC), which has been recently introduced as an easy and efficient cross-linking methodology. Four different poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based polymers with different hydrophilicity are synthesized and used to prepare films via CIC. Films prepared from the most hydrophilic PEG-based polymers display the best antifogging performances when exposed to a temperature change from \u221220 to 22 \u00b0C. Furthermore, several parameters including cross-linking density, surface roughness, hydrophobicity, and exposure time are also evaluated in terms of film transparency. Through these measurements, it is determined that, more loosely cross-linked films retain antifogging ability for longer time periods due to higher film swellability as compared to, more highly cross-linked films. This study signifies the crucial role of the film cross-linking density and hydrophilicity on the antifogging function.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Membrane technology has been recognized as an attractive and environment-friendly technology for carbon capture due to its low expense (capital and operating), ease of operation as well as low energy consumption. Traditionally, the membrane materials are cast into dense membranes with a thickness of 50\u2013150\u202f\u00b5m and their gas separation properties are evaluated by the trade-off between permeability and selectivity. However, permeance (gas flux), rather than permeability, is more emphasized recently because the increase of the real gas flux through a membrane without the loss of selectivity has been recognized to be more important in industrial scenarios. The permeance is inversely proportional to the membrane thickness, and thus the thin film membranes with sub-micro scale selective layers as part of a composite membrane has drawn particular interests. In thin film membranes, the membrane fabrication technique as well as the membrane configuration design are more important than the membrane materials. However, the recent progress on membrane fabrication techniques, especially the bottom-up approaches for composite membranes, have not been fully reviewed and compared. This review focuses on the recent progress in fabrication techniques and approaches of the thin film (sub-micron) polymeric membranes for CO 2  capture, the state-of-art performance of those membranes will be summarized, and future direction of thin film composite membrane will be discussed.",

        "abstract": "Fenton cancer therapy as a new methodology for the treatment of tumour cells is largely restricted owing to the low stability, high aggregation, and poor selectivity of reported nanoparticles. In this study, an improved approach for the selective destruction of cancer cells is reported. Metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles were synthesized and reduced via a hydrothermal method, and then PEGylated through the surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) reaction to produce a PEGylated reduced MOF (P@rMOF). The ratio of PEG to nanoparticles was used to optimize the size and aggregation of the nanoparticles, with 2P@rMOF (2\u2009:\u20091 mass ratio) having the smallest hydrodynamic diameter. The nanoparticles were further conjugated with folic acid for cell targeting. In\u2009vitro cell uptake experiments demonstrated that the internalization of 2P@rMOF-FA nanoparticles into cancer cells (HeLa) was almost 3-fold that of normal cells (NIH-3T3). In the presence of 2P@rMOF-FA, the HeLa cell viability decreased dramatically to 22\u2009%, whereas the NIH-3T3 cell viability remained higher than 80\u2009% after 24 h incubation. The selectivity index for 2P@rMOF-FA is 4.48, which is significantly higher than those reported in the literature for similar strategies. This work thus demonstrates the most stable and selective nanoparticle system for the treatment of cancer cells using the cell\u2019s own H2O2.",

However, the transition of these syntheses to automated, programmable, and high-throughput operating systems is a challenging step needed to translate the vast potential of precision polymers into machine-programmable polymers for biological and functional applications. Chain-growth polymerizations are particularly appealing for their ability to form structurally and chemically well-defined macromolecules through living/controlled polymerization techniques. Even using the latest polymerization technologies, the macromolecular engineering of complex functional materials often requires multi-step syntheses and purification of intermediates, and results in sub-optimal yields. To develop a proof-of-concept of a framework polymerization technique that is readily amenable to automation requires several key characteristics. In this study, a new approach is described that is believed to meet these requirements, thus opening avenues toward automated polymer synthesis.",

This nanoparticle was prepared via a hydrothermal method, reduced using hydroquinone, and finally conjugated with folic acid (namely, rMOF-FA). The synthesized nanoparticle shows the controlled release of iron in an acidic ex-vivo environment. Iron present on the rMOF-FA and released into solution can react with high levels of hydrogen peroxide found specifically in cancer cells to increase the hydroxyl radical concentration. The hydroxyl radicals oxidize proteins, lipids, and/or DNA within the biological system to decrease cell viability. In vitro experiments demonstrate that this novel nanoparticle is cytotoxic to cancer cells (HeLa) through generation of OH inside the cells. At low concentrations of rMOF-FA, the cancer cell viability decreases dramatically, with no obvious reduction of normal cell (NIH-3T3) viability. The calculated half-maximum inhibitory concentration value (IC) was 43 \u03bcg/mL for HeLa cells, which was significantly higher than 105 \u03bcg/mL for NIH-3T3. This work thus demonstrates a new type of agent for controlled hydroxyl radical generation using the Fenton reaction to kill the tumor cells.",

        "abstract": "Ultrathin metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets show great potential in various separation applications. In this study, MOF nanosheets are incorporated as a gutter layer in high performance, flexible thin film composite membranes (TFCMs) for CO2 separation. Ultrathin MOF nanosheets (~3-4 nm) were prepared via a surfactant-assisted method, and subsequently coated onto a flexible porous support by vacuum filtration. This produced an ultrathin (~25 nm), extremely flat MOF layer, which serves as a highly permeable gutter with reduced gas resistance when compared with conventional polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) gutter layers. Subsequent spin-coating of the ultrathin MOF gutter layer with a polymeric selective layer (Polyactive\u00ae) afforded a novel TFCM exhibiting the best CO2 separation performance yet reported for a flexible composite membrane (CO2 permeance of ~2,100 GPU with a CO2/N2 ideal selectivity of ~30). Several unique MOF nanosheets were examined as gutter layers, each differing with regard to structure and thickness (~10 and ~80 nm), with results indicating that flexibility in the ultrathin MOF layer is critical for optimised membrane performance. The inclusion of ultrathin MOF nanosheets into next-generation TFCMs has the potential for major improvements in gas separation performance over current composite membrane designs.",

        "abstract": "Burst release of a payload from polymeric particles upon photoirradiation was engineered by altering the cross-linking density. This was achieved via a dual cross-linking concept whereby noncovalent cross-linking was provided by cyclodextrin host-guest interactions, and irreversible covalent cross-linking was mediated by continuous assembly of polymers (CAP). The dual cross-linked particles (DCPs) were efficiently infiltrated (\u223c80-93%) by the biomacromolecule dextran (molecular weight up to 500 kDa) to provide high loadings (70-75%). Upon short exposure (5 s) to UV light, the noncovalent cross-links were disrupted resulting in increased permeability and burst release of the cargo (50 mol % within 1 s) as visualized by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. As sunlight contains UV light at low intensities, the particles can potentially be incorporated into systems used in agriculture, environmental control, and food packaging, whereby sunlight could control the release of nutrients and antimicrobial agents.

The effect of polymeric matrix modulus on the formation of MIMRE was investigated in detail. It was found that the MIMRE showed excellent magnetorheological (MR) effect, and the absolute and relative MR effect was of 3.61\u202fMPa and 17,286%, respectively. The relative MR effect of magnetorheological elastomer was almost 100 times higher than that of elastomers reported in previous literature. In addition, the application of MIMRE in actuators and self-healing materials was evaluated. The present MIMRE thus opens up a new avenue for the improvement of MR effect of magnetorheological elastomer, while avoiding the use of conventional plasticizer (e.g. silicon oil).",

The enhancing photocatalytic activity was evaluated for photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes. It showed ultra-high photocatalytic rate (4.17\u202fmg/g\u00b7min) and ultra-short time (about 6.0\u202fmin) for photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes (25\u202fmg/ml). The enhanced photocatalytic performance was attributed to suppress recombination of photogenerated charges and provide a new photoredox reaction pathway under molecular co-catalyst assistance. The study represents a facile method to develop ultra-effectively photocatalyst for applications in production of green and renew-able energy carrier, H 2  from water, reduction of CO 2 , synthesis of fine chemicals and remediation of environmental pollutants.",

        "abstract": "Satellite temperature measurements do not support the recent claim of a \u201cleveling off of warming\u201d over the past two decades. Tropospheric warming trends over recent 20-year periods are always significantly larger (at the 10% level or better) than model estimates of 20-year trends arising from natural internal variability. Over the full 38-year period of the satellite record, the separation between observed warming and internal variability estimates is even clearer. In two out of three recent satellite datasets, the tropospheric warming from 1979 to 2016 is unprecedented relative to internally generated temperature trends on the 38-year timescale.",

We use eight years (2006\u20132014) data from the Cloud\u2013Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) and Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) measurements. In addition to the CALIPSO cloud layer product, the clouds included in the current CALIPSO dataset as stratospheric features have been considered by separating clouds from aerosols, which are important in the TTL cloud analysis. It is also shown that the temporal variation of the stratospheric aerosols matches well with the volcanic eruption events. The TTL cloud fraction and the tropical tropopause temperature both have pronounced annual cycles and are strongly negatively correlated both temporally and spatially. The examination of the TTL cloud height relative to tropopause from collocated CALIPSO and COSMIC observations indicates that the tropopause plays a critical role in constraining the TTL cloud top height. We show that the probability density function of TTL cloud top height peaks just below the CPT while the occurrence of TTL clouds with cloud tops above the CPT could be largely explained by observed tropopause height uncertainty associated with the COSMIC vertical resolution.",

        "abstract": "AbstractRadiative transfer models of snow albedo have usually assumed a spherical shape for the snow grains, using Mie theory to compute single-scattering properties. The scattering by more realistic nonspherical snow grains is less in the forward direction and more to the sides, resulting in a smaller asymmetry factor g (the mean cosine of the scattering angle). Compared to a snowpack of spherical grains with the same area-to-mass ratio, a snowpack of nonspherical grains will have a higher albedo, thin snowpacks of nonspherical grains will more effectively hide the underlying surface, and light-absorbing particles in the snowpack will be exposed to less sunlight. These effects are examined here for nonspherical snow grains with aspect ratios from 0.1 to 10. The albedo of an opaque snowpack with equidimensional (i.e., aspect ratio 1) nonspherical snow grains is higher than that with spherical snow grains by 0.032 and 0.050, for effective grain radii of 100 and 1000 \u03bcm, respectively.

It is found that the temporal variability of vertical structure of TTL cirrus cloud fraction averaged between 15\u00b0N and 15\u00b0S can be well explained by the vertical temperature gradient below ~17.5\u00a0km but by the local temperature above for both seasonal and interannual time scales. It is also found that the TTL cirrus cloud fraction at a given altitude is best correlated with the temperature at a higher altitude and this vertical displacement increases with a decrease of the cirrus altitude. It is shown that the TTL cirrus cloud fractions at all altitudes are significantly correlated with tropical cold point tropopause (CPT) temperature. The plausible mechanisms that might be responsible for the observed relations between TTL cirrus fraction and temperature-based variables are discussed, which include ice particle sediments, cooling associated with wave propagations, change of atmospheric stability, and vertical gradient of water vapor mixing ratio. We further examine the spatial covariability of TTL total cirrus cloud fraction and CPT temperature for the interannual time scale. It is found that the El Nino\u2013Southern Oscillation and quasi-biennial oscillation are the leading factors in controlling the spatial variability of the TTL cirrus clouds and temperatures.",

Satellite data and the anthropogenic \"fingerprint\" predicted by climate models show common large-scale changes in geographical patterns of seasonal cycle amplitude. These common features include increases in amplitude at mid-latitudes in both hemispheres, amplitude decreases at high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere, and small changes in the tropics. Simple physical mechanisms explain these features. The model fingerprint of seasonal cycle changes is identifiable with high statistical confidence in five out of six satellite temperature datasets. Our results suggest that attribution studies with the changing seasonal cycle provide powerful evidence for a significant human effect on Earth's climate.",

It is well known that these measurements are affected by the scattering and emission from hydrometeors, including cloud water, precipitation, and ice particles. In this study, the hydrometeor effects on MSU/AMSU temperature observations are investigated by comparing satellite-observed temperature of the middle troposphere (TMT) with synthetic TMT constructed using temperature fields from the ECMWF Interim Reanalysis (ERA-I). Precipitation data have been used to estimate how much of the difference between these two TMT fields is due to hydrometeor contamination effects. It is shown that there exists a robust linear proportionality between TMT deficit (i.e., the measured TMT minus the synthetic TMT) and precipitation at individual grid points in monthly mean fields.

        "abstract": "AbstractPrevious studies have documented a poleward shift in the subsiding branches of Earth\u2019s Hadley circulation since 1979 but have disagreed on the causes of these observed changes and the ability of global climate models to capture them. This synthesis paper reexamines a number of contradictory claims in the past literature and finds that the tropical expansion indicated by modern reanalyses is within the bounds of models\u2019 historical simulations for the period 1979\u20132005. Earlier conclusions that models were underestimating the observed trends relied on defining the Hadley circulation using the mass streamfunction from older reanalyses. The recent observed tropical expansion has similar magnitudes in the annual mean in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH), but models suggest that the factors driving the expansion differ between the hemispheres. In the SH, increasing greenhouse gases (GHGs) and stratospheric ozone depletion contributed to tropical expansion over the late twentieth c...",

        "abstract": "In the early twenty-first century, satellite-derived tropospheric warming trends were generally smaller than trends estimated from a large multi-model ensemble. Because observations and coupled model simulations do not have the same phasing of natural internal variability, such decadal differences in simulated and observed warming rates invariably occur. Here we analyse global-mean tropospheric temperatures from satellites and climate model simulations to examine whether warming rate differences over the satellite era can be explained by internal climate variability alone. We find that in the last two decades of the twentieth century, differences between modelled and observed tropospheric temperature trends are broadly consistent with internal variability. Over most of the early twenty-first century, however, model tropospheric warming is substantially larger than observed; warming rate differences are generally outside the range of trends arising from internal variability. The probability that multi-decadal internal variability fully explains the asymmetry between the late twentieth and early twenty-first century results is low (between zero and about 9%). It is also unlikely that this asymmetry is due to the combined effects of internal variability and a model error in climate sensitivity. We conclude that model overestimation of tropospheric warming in the early twenty-first century is partly due to systematic deficiencies in some of the post-2000 external forcings used in the model simulations.

The expected declines of anthropogenic aerosols in the 21st century from present-day levels would cause an additional warming of the Earthu0027s climate system, which would aggravate the climate extremes caused by GHG warming. We examine the increased rate of precipitation extremes with global mean surface warming in the 21st century caused by anthropogenic GHGs and aerosols, using an Earth system model ensemble simulation. Similar to mean precipitation, the increased rate of precipitation extremes caused by aerosol forcing is significantly larger than that caused by GHG forcing. The aerosol forcing in the coming decades can play a critical role in inducing change in precipitation extremes if a lower GHG emission pathway is adopted. Our results have implications for policy-making on climate adaptation to extreme precipitation events.",

A recent study claimed that TMT trends over 1979 and 2015 are 3 times larger in climate models than in satellite data but did not correct for the contribution TMT trends receive from stratospheric cooling. Here, it is shown that the average ratio of modeled and observed TMT trends is sensitive to both satellite data uncertainties and model\u2013data differences in stratospheric cooling. When the impact of lower-stratospheric cooling on TMT is accounted for, and when the most recent versions of satellite datasets are used, the previously claimed ratio of three between simulated and observed near-global TMT trends is reduced to approximately 1.7. Next, the validity of the statement that satellite data show n...",

To address this observational challenge, ground-based vertically pointing active sensors at the Darwin Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) site are used to classify cloud phase within a deep convective cloud. The cloud cannot be fully observed by a lidar due to signal attenuation. Therefore, we developed an objective method for identifying hydrometeor classes, including mixed-phase conditions, using k-means clustering on parameters that describe the shape of the Doppler spectra from vertically pointing Ka-band cloud radar. This approach shows that multiple, overlapping mixed-phase layers exist within the cloud, rather than a single region of supercooled liquid. Diffusional growth calculations show that the conditions for the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen (WBF) process exist within one of these mixed-phase microstructures.",

        "abstract": "Spaceborne lidar observations have great potential to provide accurate global estimates of the aerosol direct radiative effect (DRE) in both clear and cloudy conditions. However, comparisons between observations from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite (CALIPSO) and multiple years of Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) programu0027s ground-based Raman lidars (RL) show that CALIPSO does not detect all radiatively-significant aerosol, i.e. aerosol that directly modifies the Earthu0027s radiation budget. We estimated that using CALIPSO observations results in an underestimate of the magnitude of the global mean aerosol DRE by up to 54%. The ARM RL datasets along with NASA Langley airborne high spectral resolution lidar (HSRL) data from multiple field campaigns are used to derive the detection sensitivity required to accurately resolve the aerosol DRE. This shows that a lidar with a backscatter coefficient detection sensitivity of about 1 \u2212 2x10\u22124km\u22121sr\u22121 at 532nm would resolve all the aerosol needed to derive the DRE to within 1%.",

        "abstract": "AbstractSources of intermodel differences in the global lapse rate (LR) and water vapor (WV) feedbacks are assessed using CO2 forcing simulations from 28 general circulation models. Tropical surface warming leads to significant warming and moistening in the tropical and extratropical upper troposphere, signifying a nonlocal, tropical influence on extratropical radiation and feedbacks. Model spread in the locally defined LR and WV feedbacks is pronounced in the Southern Ocean because of large-scale ocean upwelling, which reduces surface warming and decouples the surface from the tropospheric response. The magnitude of local extratropical feedbacks across models and over time is well characterized using the ratio of tropical to extratropical surface warming. It is shown that model differences in locally defined LR and WV feedbacks, particularly over the southern extratropics, drive model variability in the global feedbacks. The cross-model correlation between the global LR and WV feedbacks therefore does no...",

        "abstract": "Using field observations, we perform radiative transfer calculations on snowpacks in the Arctic, China, and North America to quantify the impact of light-absorbing particles (LAPs) on snow albedo and its sensitivity to different factors. For new snow, the regional-averaged albedo reductions caused by all LAPs in the Arctic, North America, and China are 0.009, 0.012, and 0.077, respectively, of which the albedo reductions caused by black carbon (BC) alone are 0.005, 0.005, and 0.031, corresponding to a positive radiative forcing of 0.06, 0.3, and 3\u00a0W\u00a0m\u22122. For the same particulate concentrations, the albedo reduction for old melting snow is larger than that of new snow by a factor of 2; this leads to 3\u20138 times larger radiative forcing, in part due to higher solar irradiance in the melting season. These calculations used ambient snowpack properties; if all snowpacks were instead assumed to be optically thick, the albedo reduction would be 20\u201350% larger for new snow in the Arctic and North America and 120\u2013300% larger for old snow. Accounting for non-BC LAPs reduces the albedo reduction by BC in the Arctic, North America, and China by 32%, 29%, and 70%, respectively, for new snow and 11%, 7%, and 51% for old snow. BC-in-snow albedo reduction computed using a two-layer model agrees reasonably with that computed using a multilayer model. Biases in BC concentration or snow depth often lead to nonlinear biases in BC-induced albedo reduction.",

        "abstract": "A single-column radiative-convective model (RCM) is a useful tool to investigate the physical processes that determine the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) temperature structures. Previous studies on the TTL using the RCMs, however, omitted the cloud radiative effects. In this study, we examine the impact of cloud radiative effects on the simulated TTL temperatures using an RCM. We derive the cloud radiative effects based on satellite observations, which show heating rates in the troposphere but cooling rates in the stratosphere. We find that the cloud radiative effect warms the TTL by as much as 2 K but cools the lower stratosphere by as much as \u22121.5 K, resulting in a thicker TTL. With (without) considering cloud radiative effects, we obtain a convection top of \u2248167 hPa (\u2248150 hPa) with a temperature of \u2248213 K (\u2248209 K), and a cold point at \u224887 hPa (\u224894 hPa) with a temperature of \u2248204 K (\u2248204 K). Therefore, the cloud radiative effects widen the TTL by both lowering the convection-top height and enhancing the cold-point height. We also examine the impact of TTL cirrus radiative effects on the RCM-simulated temperatures. We find that the TTL cirrus warms the TTL with a maximum temperature increase of \u22481.3 K near 110 hPa.",

This paper demonstrates that the impact of ASO can extend to the tropics, with the ASO variations leading El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events by about 20 months. Using observations, analysis, and simulations, the connection between ASO and ENSO is established by combining the high-latitude stratosphere to troposphere pathway with the extratropical to tropical climate teleconnection. This shows that the ASO radiative anomalies influence the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO), and the anomalous NPO and induced Victoria Mode anomalies link to the North Pacific circulation that then influences ENSO. Our results imply that incorporating realistic and time-varying ASO into climate system models may help to improve ENSO predictions.",

According to the OMI observations, the global annual mean tropospheric column ozone (TCO) was 33.9 DU in 2013, and the largest TCO was distributed in the belts between 30\u00b0N and 45\u00b0N and at approximately 30\u00b0S; the annual mean TCO was higher in the Northern Hemisphere than that in the Southern Hemisphere; and in boreal summer and autumn, the global mean TCO was higher than in winter and spring. The simulated ERF due to the change in tropospheric ozone concentration from 1850 to 2013 was 0.46 W m\u22122, thereby causing an increase in the global annual mean surface temperature by 0.36\u00b0C, and precipitation by 0.02 mm d\u22121 (the increase of surface temperature had a significance level above 95%). The surface temperature was increased more obviously over the high latitudes in both hemispheres, with the maximum exceeding 1.4\u00b0C in Siberia. There were opposite changes in precipitation near the equator, with an increase of 0.5 mm d\u22121 near the Hawaiian Islands and a decrease of about \u22120.6 mm d\u22121 near the middle of the Indian Ocean.",

        "abstract": "Observed and modeled patterns of lower stratospheric seasonal trends in Antarctic ozone and temperature in the late 20th (1979\u20132000) and the early 21st (2000\u20132014) centuries are compared. Patterns of pre-2000 observed Antarctic ozone decreases and stratospheric cooling as a function of month and pressure are followed by opposite-signed (i.e., \u201cmirrored\u201d) patterns of ozone increases and warming post-2000. An interactive chemistry-climate model forced by changes in anthropogenic ozone depleting substances produces broadly similar mirrored features. Statistical analysis of unforced model simulations (from long-term model control simulations of a few centuries up to 1000\u00a0years) suggests that internal and solar natural variability alone is unable to account for the pattern of observed ozone trend mirroring, implying that forcing is the dominant driver of this behavior. Radiative calculations indicate that ozone increases have contributed to Antarctic warming of the lower stratosphere over 2000\u20132014, but dynamical changes that are likely due to internal variability over this relatively short period also appear to be important. Overall, the results support the recent finding that the healing of the Antarctic ozone hole is underway and that coupling between dynamics, chemistry, and radiation is important for a full understanding of the causes of observed stratospheric temperature and ozone changes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  While nocturnal low-level jets (NLLJs) occur frequently in many parts of the world, the occurrence and other detailed characteristics of NLLJs over the Taklimakan Desert (TD) are not well known. This paper presents a climatology of NLLJs and coincident dust over the TD by analyzing multi-year ERA-Interim reanalysis and satellite observations. It is found that the ERA-Interim dataset can capture the NLLJsu0027 features well by comparison with radiosonde data from two surface sites. The NLLJs occur in more than 60\u202f% of nights, which are primarily easterly to east-northeasterly. They typically appear at 100 to 400\u202fm above the surface with a speed of 4 to 10\u202fm\u202fs \u22121 . Most NLLJs are located above the nocturnal inversion during the warm season, while they are embedded in the inversion layer during the cold season. NLLJs above the inversion have a strong annual cycle with a maximum frequency in August. We also quantify the convective boundary layer (CBL) height and construct an index to measure the magnitude of the momentum in the CBL. We find that the magnitude of momentum in the lower atmosphere from the top of the surface layer to the top of mixed layer is larger for NLLJ cases than for non-NLLJ cases, and in the warm season the downward momentum transfer process is more intense and rapid. The winds below the NLLJ core to the desert surface gain strength in summer and autumn, and these summer and autumn winds are coincident with an enhancement of aerosol optical depth. This indicates that the NLLJ is an important mechanism for dust activity and transport during the warm season over the Taklimakan.",

Square clouds  were constructed to test our algorithm and the method used for the US Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurements Program millimeter-wavelength cloud radar. We also applied both the methods to 6 months of cloud radar observations at the Semi-Arid Climate and Environment Observatory of Lanzhou University and compared the results.

        "abstract": "Drylands are home to more than 38% of the worldu0027s population and are one of the most sensitive areas to climate change and human activities. This review describes recent progress in dryland climate change research. Recent findings indicate that the long-term trend of the aridity index (AI) is mainly attributable to increased greenhouse gas emissions while anthropogenic aerosols exert small effects but alter its attributions. Atmosphere-land interactions determine the intensity of regional response. The largest warming during the last 100 years was observed over drylands and accounted for more than half of the continental warming. The global pattern and inter-decadal variability of aridity changes are modulated by oceanic oscillations. The different phases of those oceanic oscillations induce significant changes in land-sea and north-south thermal contrasts, which affect the intensity of the westerlies and planetary waves and the blocking frequency, thereby altering global changes in temperature and precipitation. During 1948-2008, the drylands in the Americas became wetter due to enhanced westerlies, whereas the drylands in the Eastern Hemisphere became drier because of the weakened East Asian summer monsoon. Drylands as defined by the AI have expanded over the last sixty years and are projected to expand in the 21st century. The largest expansion of drylands has occurred in semi-arid regions since the early 1960s. Dryland expansion will lead to reduced carbon sequestration and enhanced regional warming. The increasing aridity, enhanced warming and rapidly growing population will exacerbate the risk of land degradation and desertification in the near future in developing countries.",

        "abstract": "The accurate representation of cloud vertical overlap in atmospheric models is particularly significant for predicting the total cloud cover and for the calculations related to the radiative budget in these models. However, it has received too little attention due to the limited observation, especially over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). In this study, 4 years (2007\u20132010) of data from the CloudSat cloud product and collocated ERA-Interim reanalysis product were analyzed to examine the seasonal and zonal variations of cloud overlap properties over the TP region, and evaluate the effect of atmospheric dynamics on cloud overlap.    Unique characteristics of cloud overlap over the TP have been found. The statistical results show that the random overlap assumption slightly underestimates the total cloud coverage for discontinuous cloud layers over the TP, whereas the overlap parameter  \u03b1  for continuous cloud sharply decrease from maximum to random overlap with an increase of layer distance, eventually trending towards a minimal overlap (e.g., negative  \u03b1  values) as the cloud layer separation distance exceeds 1.5\u2009km. Compared with the global averaged cloud overlap characteristics, the proportion of minimal overlap over the TP is significant high (about 41\u2009%). It may be associated with the unique topographical forcing and thermos-dynamical environment of the TP. As a result, we propose a valid scheme for quantifying the degree of cloud overlap over the TP through a linear combination of the maximum and minimum overlap, and further parameterize decorrelation length scale  L  as a function of wind shear and atmospheric stability. Compared with other parameterizations, the new scheme reduces the bias between predicted and observed cloud covers. These results thus indicate that effects of wind shear and atmospheric stability on cloud overlap should both be taken into account in the parameterization of overlap parameter to improve the simulation of total cloud cover in models.",

        "title": "The impact of atmospheric stability and wind shear on vertical cloud overlap over the Tibetan Plateau",
        "abstract": "Studies have shown that changes in cloud cover are responsible for the rapid climate warming over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) in the past 3 decades. To simulate the total cloud cover, atmospheric models have to reasonably represent the characteristics of vertical overlap between cloud layers. Until now, however, this subject has received little attention due to the limited availability of observations, especially over the TP. Based on the above information, the main aim of this study is to examine the properties of cloud overlaps over the TP region and to build an empirical relationship between cloud overlap properties and large-scale atmospheric dynamics using 4 years (2007\u20132010) of data from the CloudSat cloud product and collocated ERA-Interim reanalysis data. To do this, the cloud overlap parameter  \u03b1 , which is an inverse exponential function of the cloud layer separation  D  and decorrelation length scale  L , is calculated using CloudSat and is discussed. The parameters  \u03b1  and  L  are both widely used to characterize the transition from the maximum to random overlap assumption with increasing layer separations. For those non-adjacent layers without clear sky between them (that is, contiguous cloud layers), it is found that the overlap parameter  \u03b1  is sensitive to the unique thermodynamic and dynamic environment over the TP, i.e., the unstable atmospheric stratification and corresponding weak wind shear, which leads to maximum overlap (that is, greater  \u03b1  values). This finding agrees well with the previous studies. Finally, we parameterize the decorrelation length scale  L  as a function of the wind shear and atmospheric stability based on a multiple linear regression. Compared with previous parameterizations, this new scheme can improve the simulation of total cloud cover over the TP when the separations between cloud layers are greater than 1\u202fkm. This study thus suggests that the effects of both wind shear and atmospheric stability on cloud overlap should be taken into account in the parameterization of decorrelation length scale  L  in order to further improve the calculation of the radiative budget and the prediction of climate change over the TP in the atmospheric models.",

        "abstract": "This study examines changes in terrestrial aridity due to both natural and anthropogenic forcing for the period 850-2080 by analyzing the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Last Millennium Ensemble simulations for 850-2005 and the CESM Large Ensemble simulations for 1920-2080. We compare terrestrial aridity in the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) (950-1250) with that in the Little Ice Age (LIA) (1550-1850), present day (PD) (1950-2005) with the last millennium (LM) (850-1850), and the future (F8.5) (2050-2080) with the LM, to place anthropogenic changes in the context of changes due to natural forcings. The aridity index defined as the ratio of annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration, averaged over land, becomes smaller (i.e., a drier terrestrial climate) by 0.34% for MWP versus LIA (MWP-LIA), 1.4% for PD versus LM (PD-LM), and 7.8% for F8.5 versus LM (F8.5-LM). The change of terrestrial-mean aridity in PD-LM and F8.5-LM due to anthropogenic forcing is thus 4 and 20 times of that from MWP-LIA due to natural forcing, respectively. It is shown that a drier climate in PD than LM is largely due to a decrease of precipitation while a drier climate in F8.5 than LM, and MWP than LIA, is mainly caused by an increase of temperature. The terrestrial-mean aridity change in PD-LM is, however, largely driven by greenhouse gas increases as in F8.5-LM. This is because anthropogenic aerosols have a small effect on terrestrial-mean aridity but at the same time they totally alter the attributions of aridity changes to meteorological variables by causing large negative anomalies in surface air temperature, available energy, and precipitation. Different from MWP-LIA and F8.5-LM, there are large spatial inhomogeneities in P/PET changes for PD-LM in both magnitudes and signs, caused by anthropogenic aerosols, greenhouse gases, and land surface changes. The changes of terrestrial-mean P and P-E (precipitation minus evaporation) for 850-2080 are also examined. The relative changes in P (P-E) are 0.4% (0.6%) for MWP-LIA, -2.6% (-3.8%) for PD-LM, and 4.7% (11.8%) for F8.5-LM. The signs of changes in P-E and P are the same.",

        "title": "Midlatitude Cirrus Clouds at the SACOL Site: Macrophysical Properties and Large\u2010Scale Atmospheric States",
        "abstract": "Two-year observations of a Ka-band Zenith Radar at the Semi-Arid Climate and Environment Observatory of Lanzhou University (SACOL) are used to document the midlatitude cirrus cloud macroproperties. Generally, cirrus occurs 41.6% of the observation time and most frequently appear at about 7.2 km above ground level. The cirrus macroproperties are strongly coupled with large-scale atmospheric states; thus, its occurrence and location over the SACOL have significant seasonal variations. A k-mean clustering method is used to classify cirrus into four distinct regimes without a prior knowledge about the meteorological process. Contrasting to the different cirrus physical properties in each regime, the cirrus event of each regime has a distinct seasonal distribution and the synoptic conditions from the ERA-Interim reanalysis responsible for each cirrus regime are also quite different. Since global climate models typically overestimate cirrus cloud thickness due to inadequate parameterization or coarse grid resolution, we examined the probability density functions of large-scale vertical velocity associated with each cirrus regime and the relationship between cirrus thickness and vertical velocity. It is found that the differences of the vertical velocity probability density functions among the cirrus regimes are as distinct as their macroproperties and a significant correlation exists between cirrus thickness and the vertical velocity, although the large-scale vertical motion is nearly as likely to be descending as ascending when cirrus clouds are observed. This may imply that large-scale vertical velocity can be used to constrain the variations of cirrus thickness simulated by global climate models. Plain Language Summary Cirrus clouds are composed of large amount of ice crystals, most frequently distributed in the midlatitude storm track regions and the tropics, and cover about 30% of the Earth surface. They have significant impact on water cycle and radiative balance and thus play an important role in our climate system. These processes strongly depend on the cirrus properties such as top height and vertical distribution. However, cirrus clouds are still a great challenge to be accurately represented in climate models due to incomplete knowledge of their occurrence and physical and dynamical properties that can cause large uncertainties in climate prediction. We obtained the cirrus macroproperties from the cloud radar observations at the Semi-Arid Climate and Environment Observatory of Lanzhou University (a midlatitude site in western China) and found that the cirrus macroproperties are strongly coupled with large-scale atmospheric states. This may help us to better understand the connection between cirrus properties and dynamic processes.",

The work not only identifies atmosphere particle layers by means of the range-dependent thresholds based on elastic scattering ratio and depolarization ratio, but also discriminates the detected layers by combining empirical thresholds of the atmosphere's thermodynamics states and scattering properties and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) analyses. Two cases were first presented in detail that demonstrated that the modified algorithm can capture atmosphere layers well. The cloud macro-physical properties including cloud base height (CBH), cloud geometrical thickness (CGT), and cloud fraction (CF) were then analyzed in terms of their monthly and seasonal variations. It is shown that the maximum/minimum CBHs were found in summer (4.66 \u00b1 1.95km)/autumn (3.34 \u00b1 1.84km). The CGT in winter (1.05 \u00b1 0.43km) is slightly greater than in summer (0.99 \u00b1 0.44km). CF varies significantly throughout year, with the maximum value in autumn (0.68), and a minimum (0.58) in winter, which is dominated by single-layered clouds (81%). The vertical distribution of CF shows a bimodal distribution, with a lower peak between 1 and 4km and a higher one between 6and 9km. The seasonal and vertical variations in CF are important for the local radiative energy budget.",

By incorporation of the negative polymer of enoxaparin sodium (ES), DOX was highly encapsulated into EPNs with an encapsulation efficiency of 92.49%, and ES effectively inhibited the proliferation of HUVEC cell lines. The in vivo pharmacokinetics study after intravenous injection indicated that DOX-loaded EPNs (DOX-EPNs) exhibited a higher area under the curve (AUC) and a longer half-life (t1/2) in comparison with DOX solution (DOX-Sol). The biodistribution study demonstrated that DOX-EPNs increased the DOX level in plasma and decreased the accumulation of DOX in liver and spleen. Compared with DOX-Sol, DOX-EPNs increased the cytotoxicity in P-gp over-expressing MCF-7/Adr cells, attributed to the higher intracellular efficiency of DOX produced by the EPNs. DOX-EPNs entered into resistant tumor cells by multiple endocytosis pathways, which resulted in overcoming the multidrug resistance of MCF-7/Adr cells by escaping the efflux induced by P-gp transporters.",

Lacidipine with the polymers, PVP-K30, HPMC-E5 or Soluplus, were combined to form amorphous solid dispersions prepared by solvent evaporation. The formulations were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and were subjected to in vitro dissolution testing. The moisture had a significant impact on the amount dissolved for the solid dispersions. Molecular docking studies established that hydrogen bonding was critical for the stabilization of the solid dispersions. The rank order of the binding energy of the drug\u2013polymer association was Soluplus (\u22126.21 kcal/mol) > HPMC-E5 (\u22123.21 kcal/mol) > PVP-K30 (\u22122.31 kcal/mol). PVP-K30 had the highest water uptake among the polymers, as did ASD system of lacidipine-PVP-K30 ASDs. In the Soluplus ASDs, with its strong drug\u2013polymer interactions and low water uptake, moisture-induced solid-state crystallization was not observed.",

        "abstract": "For a highly hydrophobic and drug, it is difficult to formulate and solidify its nanocrystals with high drug loading and good redispersity. In this study, Allisartan Isoproxil was used as a model drug, and SDS was tested in combination with sugar alcohols to improve the drug loading and redispersity for its spray-dried nanocrystals, simultaneously. These spray-dried nanocrystals had high drug loading of 61.7% and good redispersity, which was mainly attributed to the addition of SDS. In addition, the nanocrystals were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray power diffraction analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The results showed that Allisartan Isoproxil was unchanged in chemical structure, but was partially amorphous. Regarding the in vitro dissolution, the optimism formulation shown an increased dissolution compared with the bulk drug and aggregated nanocrystals. Importantly, the optimum formulation increased the oral bioavailability of crude ALS-3 for 4.73 times. In conclusion, we developed a method to solidify aqueous nanocrystals with increased drug loading, good redispersity and improved bioavailability for high hydrophobic drugs.",

Herein, we report a novel active targeting strategy based on the large amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) overexpressed in a variety of cancers. Glutamate was conjugated to polyoxyethylene stearate as a targeting ligand to achieve LAT1-targeting PLGA nanoparticles. The targeting efficiency of nanoparticles was investigated in HeLa and MCF-7 cells. Significant increase in cellular uptake and cytotoxicity was observed in LAT1-targeting nanoparticles compared to the unmodified ones. More interestingly, the internalized LAT1 together with targeting nanoparticles could recycle back to the cell membrane within 3 h, guaranteeing sufficient transporters on cell membrane for continuous cellular uptake. The LAT1 targeting nanoparticles exhibited better tumor accumulation and antitumor effects. These results suggested that the overexpressed LAT1 on cancer cells holds a great potential to be a high-efficiency target for the rational design of active-targeting nanosystems.",

        "abstract": "In order to improve oral bioavailability of tacrolimus (FK506), a novel poly(methyl vinyl ether-co-maleic anhydride)-graft-hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin amphiphilic copolymer (CD-PVM/MA) is developed, combining the bioadhesiveness of PVM/MA, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and cytochrome P450-inhibitory effect of CD into one. The FK506-loaded nanoparticles (CD-PVM/MA-NPs) were obtained by solvent evaporation method. The physiochemical properties and intestinal absorption mechanism of FK506-loaded CD-PVM/MA-NPs were characterized, and the pharmacokinetic behavior was investigated in rats. FK506-loaded CD-PVM/MA-NPs exhibited nanometer-sized particles of 273.7 nm, with encapsulation efficiency as high as 73.3%. FK506-loaded CD-PVM/MA-NPs maintained structural stability in the simulated gastric fluid, and about 80% FK506 was released within 24 h in the simulated intestinal fluid. The permeability of FK506 was improved dramatically by CD-PVM/MA-NPs compared to its solution, probably due to the synergistic inhibition effect of P-gp and cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). The intestinal biodistribution of fluorescence-labeled CD-PVM/MA-NPs confirmed its good bioadhesion to the rat intestinal wall. Two endocytosis pathways, clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, were involved in the cellular uptake of CD-PVM/MA-NPs. The important role of lymphatic transport in nanoparticles\u2019 access to the systemic circulation, about half of the contribution to oral bioavailability, was observed in mesenteric lymph duct ligated rats. The AUC0\u201324 of FK506 loaded in nanoparticles was enhanced up to 20-fold compared to FK506 solutions after oral administration. The present study suggested that the novel multifunctional CD-PVM/MA is a promising efficient oral delivery carrier for FK506, due to its ability in solubilization, inhibitory effects on both P-gp and CYP 3A, high bioadhesion, and sustained release capability.",

        "abstract": "l-Carnitine, obligatory for oxidation of fatty acids, is transported into cells by the Na-coupled transporter OCTN2 and the Na/Cl-coupled transporter ATB. Here we investigated the potential of L-carnitine-conjugated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (LC-PLGA NPs) to deliver chemotherapeutic drugs into cancer cells by targeting the nanoparticles to both OCTN2 and ATB. The cellular uptake of LC-PLGA NPs in the breast cancer cell line MCF7 and the colon cancer cell line Caco-2 was increased compared to unmodified nanoparticles, but decreased in the absence of co-transporting ions (Na and/or Cl) or in the presence of competitive substrates for the two transporters. Studies with fluorescently labeled nanoparticles showed their colocalization with both OCTN2 and ATB, confirming the involvement of both transporters in the cellular uptake of LC-PLGA NPs. As the expression levels of OCTN2 and ATB are higher in colon cancer cells than in normal colon cells, LC-PLGA NPs can be used to deliver chemotherapeutic drugs selectively into cancer cells for colon cancer therapy. With 5-fluorouracil-loaded LC-PLGA NPs, we were able to demonstrate significant increases in the uptake efficiency and cytotoxicity in colon cancer cells that were positive for OCTN2 and ATB. In a 3D spheroid model of tumor growth, LC-PLGA NPs showed increased uptake and enhanced antitumor efficacy. These findings indicate that dual-targeting LC-PLGA NPs to OCTN2 and ATB has great potential to deliver chemotherapeutic drugs for colon cancer therapy. Dual targeting LC-PLGA NPs to OCTN2 and ATB0,+ can selectively deliver chemotherapeutics to colon cancer cells where both transporters are overexpressed, preventing targeting to normal cells and thus avoiding off-target side effects.",

Infrared spectroscopy (IR), raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectra and contact angle instrument were used throughout the study. Hydrogen bond energy formed between PEG and IMC were stronger than that of PVP and IMC evidenced by molecular modeling measurement. The blue shift of raman spectroscopy confirmed that hydrogen bonding forces were formed between IMC and two polymers. The contact angle study can be used as an easy method to determine the dissolution mechanism of amorphous solid dispersions through fitting the profile of contact angle of water on a series of tablets. It is believed that the track of interfacial interactions will certainly become powerful tools to for designing and evaluating amorphous solid dispersions.",

        "abstract": "Nanocrystal (NC) technology is an effective strategy to enhance the oral bioavailability for poorly water-soluble drugs. Stabilizers are essential and important in NC formulations due to its ability to decrease the system energy. Studies have revealed that stabilizers can affect the particle size and stability of the system. However, whether stabilizers can affect the in vivo behaviors of the NCs is unknown. To investigate the effects of stabilizers on the in vitro and in vivo performances of NCs, four types of spironolactone (SPN) NCs with similar diameters but different stabilizers were prepared. All the NCs were spherical in shape with a size of about 370nm. In addition, the NCs were also characterized by differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy, the results obtained showed that the SPN in all the formulations was partially amorphous. In fasted state simulated intestinal fluid, all the SPN-NCs showed similar dissolution profiles. However, the dissolution for SPN-NCs/NaDC was suppressed in 0.1M HCl. Importantly, the AUC(0-48h)total for SPN-NCs/F127, SPN-NCs/F68, SPN-NCs/HPMC-E5, and SPN-NCs/NaDC was 4.96-, 3.91-, 2.88- and 1.72-fold higher than that of the SPN suspension, respectively. These results demonstrated that stabilizers in NCs played an important role for the in vivo pharmacokinetic behaviors. It is highly suggested that the ionic stabilizers are not suitable to stabilize drug nanocrystals alone because it may induce aggregation and agglomeration of drug crystals when transferring through the whole gastrointestinal tract and experiencing the different pH levels.

        "abstract": "To increase the encapsulation efficiency and oral absorption of doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX), a novel drug delivery system of enoxaparin sodium-PLGA hybrid nanoparticles (EPNs) was successfully designed. By introducing the negative polymer of enoxaparin sodium (ES) to form an electrostatic complex with the cationic drug, DOX, the encapsulation efficiency (93.78%) of DOX was significantly improved. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results revealed that the DOX-ES complex was in an amorphous form. An in vitro release (pH6.8 PBS) study showed the excellent sustained-release characteristics of DOX-loaded EPNs (DOX-EPNs). In addition, in situ intestinal perfusion and intestinal biodistribution experiments demonstrated the improved membrane permeability and intestinal wall bioadhesion of DOX-EPNs, and caveolin- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathways were the main mechanisms responsible. The cytotoxicity of DOX was significantly increased by EPNs in Caco-2 cells, compared with DOX-Sol. Confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) images confirmed that the amount of DOX-EPNs internalized by Caco-2 cells was higher than that of DOX-Sol showing that P-glycoprotein-mediated drug efflux was reduced by the introduction of EPNs. The qualitative detection of transcytosis demonstrated the ability of the nanoparticles (NPs) to cross Caco-2 cell monolayers. An in vivo toxicity experiment demonstrated that DOX-EPNs reduced cardiac and renal toxic effects and were biocompatible. An in vivo pharmacokinetics study showed that the AUC and t of DOX-EPNs were increased to 3.63-fold and 2.47-fold in comparison with DOX solution (DOX-Sol), respectively. All these results indicated that the novel EPNs were an excellent platform to improve the encapsulation efficiency of an aqueous solution of this antitumor drug and its oral bioavailability.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Polyethylene oxide (PEO) has been extensively used as an extended-release excipient in matrix tablets due to its extraordinarily safe, stable, soluble, swellable and erodible properties. The present study aimed to develop once-daily sustained-release tablets using PEO for a highly water-soluble drug, diltiazem hydrochloride (DH), the clinical application of which is limited because of its short half-life in vivo. However, the prophase study demonstrated that the use of PEO alone could only retard the drug release to 8\u00a0h. Thus, we proposed its combined use with chitosan/sodium alginate and formulated ternary matrix tablets by direct compression, in the hope of further extending the release of DH. The in vitro release study demonstrated that the ternary matrix synergistically prolonged DH release to 24\u00a0h while the kinetic mechanism study showed that its release was correlated with Korsmeyer\u2013Peppas models and a non-Fickian drug release mechanism. Its release was primarily governed by diffusion and secondarily by erosion. The results of the present study demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of using a ternary hybrid matrix to prolong the release of highly water-soluble drugs, at least in the case of DH, which has a solubility as high as 625\u00a0mg/mL.",

To tackle the dilemma, more and more attentions were focused on developing nutrient transporters-mediated dual-targeted drug delivery system, in one side for BBB penetration, another for intracranial glioma targeting. Herein, Large amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), overexpressed both on BBB and glioma cells, was selected as a target. Docetaxel-loaded glutamate- d -\u03b1-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate copolymer (Glu-TPGS) functionalized LAT1-targeting liposomes (DTX-TGL) were applied to enhance the BBB penetration and glioma therapy. The  in vivo  results of the fluorescent image indicated that TGL possessed an effective BBB penetration than that of unmodified ones in mice. The LAT1 targeting effcicacy and cell cytotoxicity of TGL were investigated in C6 glioma cells. Compared with unmodified liposomes, a significant higher cellular uptake and cell cytotoxicity was found in TGL treated group. Our results indicated that LAT1-targeting docetaxel-loaded liposome paves up a new direction using LAT1 transporter as a good target in designing brain glioma-targeting nanosystems.",

The present study aimed to develop an amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) for nisoldipine, using hot melt extrusion, to increase or equilibrate with the  in vitro  dissolution and  in vivo  oral absorption of Nierxin, its commercial tablet formulation. The final preparation was prepared with Kollidon VA64 at a drug polymer weight ratio of 1:10. The amorphous state was confirmed by powder X-ray diffractometry, differential scanning calorimetry, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. This ASD exhibited a higher dissolution profile than Nierxin and its physical mixtures. It maintained an amorphous state when stored at 60\u00a0\u00b0C over 10\u00a0days, however, the hydrogen bonds between nisoldipine and Kollidon VA64 were disrupted and its dissolution slightly reduced when stored at RH 92.5% for 10\u00a0days. The pharmacokinetic study carried out in beagle dogs demonstrated that the ASD was bioequivalent to Nierxin. The results of this study suggest that ASD prepared by hot melt extrusion can be used as a suitable alternative to Nierxin in the future.",

Intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intravenous and hydrodynamic inoculations of B16F10 cells were compared among CD-1, C57BL/6 and Balb/c mice. Most surprisingly, allogeneic tumour growth in Balb/c mice after intravenous and hydrodynamic inoculation of B16F10 cells was faster than tumour growth in the syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. These and other variations in the tumour growth patterns described here can help provide the researcher with more experimental control when planning to use the optimal tumour model for any particular study.",

        "abstract": "Currently, nanosizing is becoming increasingly prevalent as an efficient way for the improvement of oral drug absorption. This study mainly focuses on two points, namely the crystal properties, and the in vitro and in vivo characterizations of drug crystals during the nanosizing process. We used glyburide, an oral type 2 diabetes (T2D) medication, as our model drug. We sought to reduce the crystalline size of this drug and evaluate its absorption properties by comparing it with the original coarse drug because of previous reports about its gastrointestinal absorption insufficiency. Glyburide crystals, ranging from 237.6 to 4473\u00a0nm were prepared successfully by jet milling and media milling. The particle sizes and the crystal morphology were analyzed by characterization of the solid states, equilibrium solubility, and dissolution behavior. Additionally, pharmacokinetic study was performed in SD rats. The solid state results indicated a loss in crystallinity, amide-imidic acid interconversion, and partial amorphization during nanosizing. Further, in in vitro tests, nanocrystal formulations remarkably increased the solubility and dissolution of the drug (compared to microcrystals). In the in vivo test, reducing the particle size from 601.3 to 312.5\u00a0nm showed no improvement on the C max and AUC (0\u201336\u00a0h) values, while a profound slowing of the drug elimination occurred with reduction of particle size. Further reduction from 312.5 to 237.6\u00a0nm lead to a significant increase (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) of the AUC (0\u201336\u00a0h) from 6857.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0369.3\u00a0ng\u00a0mL\u22121\u00a0h to 12,928.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01591.4\u00a0ng\u00a0mL\u22121\u00a0h, respectively, in rats. Our present study confirmed that nanosizing has a tremendous impact on promoting the oral absorption of glyburide.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Nanocrystal is one of the classic formulation strategies for poorly water-soluble drugs. In this study, nitrendipine (NTD) nanocrystals were prepared using a media milling method for the first time. Comprehensive physical characterizations of NTD nanocrystals were carried out including hydrodynamic diameter, polydispersity index, zeta potential, transmission electron microscope, scanning electron microscope, differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and optical microscope. The optimized nanocrystals stabilized by 1.25% (w/v) HPMC-E5 and 0.4% (w/v) SDS were oblong-shaped with a particle size of 256.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.6\u202fnm. The crystal structure of NTD nanocrystals was maintained during the milling process, but a portion of crystal was transformed to amorphous state. No obvious interaction was detected between the drug and stabilizers. In addition, the physical stability and  in vitro  dissolution were assessed. NTD nanocrystals were physically stable during the storage at 25\u202f\u00b1\u202f2\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fdays. In the dissolution test, for NTD nanocrystals, the accumulative release after 20\u202fmin was over 80% in the media of 0.3% SDS, which was 4-fold higher than those of physical mixture and commercial tablets. The results indicated that NTD nanocrystals exhibited superior dissolution due to the reduced particle size. In conclusion, drug nanocrystal produced by wet media milling is a promising strategy for improving the solubility and dissolution rate for NTD.",

The objective of this study was to explore the feasibility of developing, using a bilayer tablet strategy, an immediate- and extended-release formulation of amoxicillin. The formulation of each layer was optimized separately and the bilayer tablets were compressed at an immediate/extended layer weight ratio of 3:7. The  in vitro  release of the bilayer tablets was evaluated and it was found to be very similar to Moxatag\u00ae, an immediate- and extended-release formulation approved by FDA. The kinetic mechanism study showed that the release of the bilayer tablets correlated better with the Ritger\u2013Peppas model (correlation coefficient R\u00a0=\u00a00.9963) and a non-Fickian drug release mechanism, and its release was principally driven by diffusion and secondarily by polymer erosion. The stress testing demonstrated that high temperature and humidity are potential risk factors affecting the quality of the bilayer tablets. In addition, the bilayer tablets showed a similar bioavailability to Moxatag\u00ae in beagle dogs. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of developing an immediate- and extended-release formulation of amoxicillin for once-daily use using a bilayer tablet strategy.",

Infrared spectroscopy (IR), raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectra and contact angle instrument were used throughout the study. Hydrogen bond energy formed between PEG and IMC were stronger than that of PVP and IMC evidenced by molecular modeling measurement. The blue shift of raman spectroscopy confirmed that hydrogen bonding forces were formed between IMC and two polymers. The contact angle study can be used as an easy method to determine the dissolution mechanism of amorphous solid dispersions through fitting the profile of contact angle of water on a series of tablets. It is believed that the track of interfacial interactions will certainly become powerful tools to for designing and evaluating amorphous solid dispersions.",

The effects of independent process variables (microprecipitation temperature, shearing speed, shearing time, homogenization pressure and number of cycles) on the particle size have been studied. Experiments were conducted to optimize the formulation composition. A single factor exploration was used to screen the primary stabilizers. Then, the selected polymers/surfactants were further optimized using an L9 (34) orthogonal design. The optimal formulation was composed of NMD (0.7 %, w/v), F127 (0.4 %, w/v), HPMC-E5 (0.1 %, w/v), and sodium deoxycholate (0.05 %, w/v) and was rod-shaped as shown by SEM observations, and it had a particle size of 833.3 \u00b1 20.6 nm, determined by laser diffraction. These aqueous NCs were physically stable for 15 days. To further improve the stability, the NCs were freeze-dried. The powder obtained exhibited acceptable flowability and was physically stable for at least 24 months. Additionally, the NMD NCs displayed much higher dissolution profiles than the bulk drug. The pharmacokinetic results showed that the relative bioavailability was 397 % in comparison with Nimotop\u00ae, suggesting that NCs are an efficient strategy for improving the oral bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs.",

        "abstract": "Andrographolide (AND) has wide prospects in clinical use, but suffers from the restriction of poor oral bioavailability, due to its low solubility, rapid and extensive metabolism and efflux by P-glycoprotein (P-gp). In this study, for the first time, nanocrystals of AND, a model of BCS class II, were obtained via the wet milling method, with TPGS as a stabilizer to enhance the bioavailability of AND; HPMC E5 nanocrystals (E5NCs) were fabricated as the negative control. Using the optimized formulation, AND/TPGS nanocrystals (TNCs) and E5NCs were prepared. Physical characterizations demonstrated that the two nanocrystals shared similar particle size, the same crystallinity and identical morphology. Both nanocrystals were physically stable at 4 \u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C, respectively, for at least 1 month. Significant increases in cumulative dissolution (90% and 70%) were obtained after the TNCs and E5NCs dissolved at 60 min, which were higher than for coarse AND (no more than 40%), indicating that TNCs were superior to E5NCs in dissolution. As elucidated in the single-pass intestinal perfusion studies of AND, the nanocrystals could facilitate intestinal uptake, and TPGS possessed improved intestine absorption properties. Oral administration of AND nanocrystals produced a substantial improvement in oral absorption, compared to the AND coarse suspension. Compared to E5NCs, there was a significant difference in AUC0\u201324h after the oral administration of TNCs. Compared to the model group, the TNCs and E5NCs inhibited xylene induced ear swelling by 59.98 and 48.06%, respectively. These results corroborated that TNCs were a promising formulation choice for the oral delivery of AND.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Nisoldipine is a calcium channel blocker mainly used for the treatment of hypertension, but its oral bioavailability is limited because of its low aqueous solubility and extensive metabolism. Solid dispersion and micronized formulations have been tested to improve its oral bioavailability, and we have demonstrated that the two formulations were bioequivalent. In this study, we intended to improve the oral bioavailability by reducing the particle sizes to the nanoscale region. To achieve this, drug crystals with different particle sizes (1227.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a055.1\u00a0nm, 472.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.5\u00a0nm, and 240.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.7\u00a0nm) were prepared by adjusting the formulation and process parameters using a media milling method. Then, physical characterization (DSC, PXRD, and FT-IR) demonstrated that the crystal state remained unchanged during the preparation, and no interaction between nisoldipine and the excipients was involved in any of the formulations.  In vitro  dissolution studies showed that the dissolution rates of the nanocrystals were much faster than that of the microcrystals, and pharmacokinetic studies in rats demonstrated that the oral absorption was size-dependent. Above all, this study demonstrated the feasibility of using drug nanocrystal strategy to improve the oral bioavailability of nisoldipine and, in particular, nisoldipine nanocrystals with a size of 240.3\u00a0nm showed a superior oral absorption.",

        "abstract": "Agriculture is the largest user of freshwater which is essential for food production. Water, energy and food are closely intertwined, as both water and energy are critical inputs for food production. Increasing pressure from shortages of resources and increasing demand for food reinforce the need for optimal management of the water, energy, and food nexus. Uncertainties caused by natural conditions and human activities complicate the optimal allocation. An integrated model, called AWEFSM, was developed for the sustainable management of limited water-energy-food resource in an agricultural system by incorporating multi-objective programming, nonlinear programming, and intuitionistic fuzzy numbers into a general framework. The AWEFSM model is capable of identifying the tradeoffs of water, energy and land resources among various subareas and crops, generating high-profile and environment-friendly strategies and policies, and addressing parameter uncertainties associated with the fluctuations of natural resources and variation of socioeconomic activities. The AWEFSM model was solved, considering nonlinear membership and non-membership functions with both optimistic and pessimistic views of decision makers, and was demonstrated for a real-world case study in northwest China. The interrelationships and trade-offs among system components, including water supply-demand, energy supply-demand, land demand, food production, as well as water and energy footprints, were quantitatively analyzed under different scenarios. The AWEFSM model is applicable for similar regions dominated by agriculture with limited resource supplies to determine water-energy-food strategies under uncertainty.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To determine the main influencing factors of the two-dimensional process of channel section infiltration, an accurate and effective soil water infiltration model was constructed to dynamically simulate the infiltration process of farmland irrigation channels. Based on laboratory experiments, an infiltration system consisting of a water supply unit and a cuboid plexiglass unit was set up. Five different initial conditions were established for soil bulk density, initial water content, channel bottom width, infiltration head and slope coefficient. On this basis, the cumulative infiltration and wet front processes along the section of the artificial channel were explored and the two-dimensional soil water motion equation under the experimental setting conditions was established. The model was solved using HYDRUS-2D software, and an error analysis between the simulated value and the measured value was carried out. The results show that the software simulation results are good. Additionally, based on the experimental data, models of cumulative infiltration and wetting front migration distance were proposed. According to the modeling results, the standard regression coefficients of each influential factor were calculated for the fitting parameters, and the effect of each factor on the fitting parameters was analyzed. The error analysis showed that the established model of soil water movement could effectively simulate the process of soil water infiltration under experimental conditions. The analysis of the standard regression coefficients suggested that the slope coefficient had the smallest influence on the fitting parameters and could be eliminated. The model results showed that the calculated and measured values were all distributed around the 1:1 line, and this result reflects the accuracy of the model. The results can provide theoretical support for the design of irrigation systems and improve the efficiency of irrigation water use.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The soil freezing process affects the distribution of soil water and heat, influencing decisions on the planting of spring crops. To reveal the redistribution characteristics of soil moisture and temperature and their response factors in the unidirectional freezing process, an indoor unidirectional freezing test was carried out. Three levels of initial moisture content (18.84%, 23.43%, 28.78%), three freezing temperatures (\u22125\u202f\u00b0C, \u221210\u202f\u00b0C, \u221215\u202f\u00b0C), and three dry densities (1.33\u202fg\u00b7cm \u22123 , 1.45\u202fg\u00b7cm \u22123 , 1.58\u202fg\u00b7cm \u22123 ) were set up. Firstly, the distribution of soil cold structure and the variation in the freezing depth curve during the freezing process were observed under different initial conditions. Additionally, the variation characteristics of soil temperature over time and space scales were analyzed, and the freezing process was divided into the rapid freezing stage and the steady freezing stage according to the rate of soil temperature change. Furthermore, the redistribution effect of soil water under the action of potential energy gradient and the characteristics of water migration in different periods were explored. On this basis, the transfer functions of soil temperature at time and space scales were constructed in accordance with regression theory. On the premise of significance test, the effects of soil moisture content and dry density on soil temperature over time and space scales were explored via function derivation and parameter analysis. With the increase of moisture content, the density of soil temperature contours decreased. However, as the dry density increased and the freezing temperature decreased, the density of soil temperature contours increased. As the soil freezing temperature decreased, the degree of soil freezing increased, the pore structure was blocked by frozen ice, and the amount of soil water migration decreased. At the same time, due to increasing soil dry density, the amount of soil water migration and migration rate also decreased. The parameter analysis showed that on the time scale, the change rate of soil temperature decreased as the moisture content increased, whereas it increased as the soil dry density increased; similarly, on the spatial scale, the soil moisture content was negatively correlated and the dry density of soil positively correlated with the soil temperature change rate. The results of this study are of great relevance for understanding the intrinsic relationships between soil moisture content, temperature and dry density in frozen soil and scientifically guiding the development of water and soil resources in cold regions.",

Drought assessment can identify the hidden dangers of drought and provide a theoretical basis for disaster prevention and mitigation. In this paper, a new agricultural drought risk assessment method proposed from the perspective of grain yield. The first principal components of precipitation, temperature, humidity and soil moisture represent hazard factors. The sensitive yield, which represents the sensitivity, was separated from the grain yield using a regression method. Additionally, the trend component of the grain yield represents the adaptive capacity, and the crop planting area represents exposure. Based on these definitions, the concepts of unit drought risk and regional drought risk are proposed. Four cities in Heilongjiang Province, which has the highest grain yield of any province in China, were used as application examples, and the spatial and temporal variation in the agricultural drought risk were analyzed. Application example show that the method for evaluating agricultural drought presented in this paper is reasonable in a statistical sense. The process for calculating sensitivity and adaptability shows that this method is suitable for arid and semi-arid areas, where grain yield is sensitive to hazard factors, and areas where grain yield has a certain trend.",

        "abstract": "Demands for water, food, and energy are rising owing to increasing population and growing economy. Agriculture is the main source of food and is the largest consumer of water and has therefore the greatest impact on water security. It also greatly affects energy security and is also the main source of non-point source pollution. Changes in the availability of water, energy, and land are driven by uncertainties in nature and strongly affect food production, with severe implications for the security of water\u2013food\u2013energy nexus (WFEN). Thus, a coordinated and effective management of WFEN in the agricultural sector is needed. This paper therefore proposes an integrated modelling approach for the optimization of agricultural WFEN in a random environment. The approach quantifies the interactions and feedbacks within agricultural water, food and energy subsystems, making tradeoffs between agricultural benefit and environmental impacts, which will serve as sustainability indicators for agricultural systems, including crop farming and livestock farming. The incorporation of stochastic mathematical programming in the modeling framework aids in understanding how strategies and comprehensive benefits change under different scenarios. The approach was applied in a real-world case study in an irrigation district in northeast China. The development and implementation of such an integrated approach are anticipated to be applied in other agriculture-centered regions to guide policies of sustainable water, food, energy and land resources management.",

In the zooplankton-invertebrate-fish based food web, both significant trophic magnification for D (R\u202f=\u202f0.16, p\u202f<\u202f0.0001, TMF\u202f=\u202f3.0) and significant trophic dilution for D (R\u202f=\u202f0.073, p\u202f<\u202f0.01, TMF\u202f=\u202f0.4) were found, but for D and D, the trophic magnifications were not significant (D: R\u202f=\u202f0.010, p\u202f=\u202f0.23, D: R\u202f=\u202f0.010, p\u202f=\u202f0.23). The trophic transfer of the legacy contaminant BDE-47 and BDE-99 were also conducted as the benchmark chemicals and significant positive correlation was found. As far as we know, this is the first research on the trophic transfer of CMS in the zooplankton-invertebrate-fish-bird food chain which provided new insight of these compounds in the area.",

        "abstract": "Herein, we analyzed and explored the spatial\u2013temporal variations, possible sources, and evaluated soil\u2013air exchange of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in urban environments in China. For the 11 Chinese cities that were considered in the study, the Spearman correlations of \u22120.418 (p = 0.201) for autumn (2004) and \u22120.797 (p = 0.003) for spring (2008) between the atmospheric concentrations of PCBs and average temperature were obtained during the sampling period, suggesting that temperature can affect the atmospheric concentrations of PCBs in spring, but not in autumn, which may be driven by comprehensive factors. The Pearson correlation coefficients for the relationship between the concentrations of different PCB homologues among these cities indicate that in 2004 and 2008, the sources of PCBs in the urban atmosphere were different. In 2008, PentaCB to HeptaCB in the atmosphere possibly originated from intentionally produced PCBs (IP-PCBs), whereas DiCB to TetraCB might have been derived from the unintentionally produced PCBs (UP-PCBs) and e-waste (EW-PCBs). These results indicate a shift in the emission sources of PCBs in urban atmosphere from IP-PCBs to a combination of IP-PCBs, UP-PCBs, and EW-PCBs. Moreover, UP-PCBs and EW-PCBs are considered supplementary or major emission sources in the current environment, and thus the reduction and control of UP-PCBs and EW-PCBs should be paid more attention. The results of the study on soil\u2013air exchange of PCBs showed that in 2008, the soil still acted as a sink and the net flux was from air to soil for all the PCB congeners, whereas in 2013\u20132014, the direction of the net flux was reversed, from soil to air for PCB28 and PCB52, indicating that in 2013\u20132014, secondary emissions could be an important source of these two PCB congeners.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Biochar as a soil amendment has attracted wide attention worldwide. However, the study of biochar on soil hydraulic properties during freeze-thawing remains insufficient. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of straw biochar on soil water retention and soil hydraulic conductivity during a freeze-thaw period. Specifically, the effects of different biochar application rates (0, 30, 60, 90 and 120\u202ft\u00b7hm \u22122 ) on the soil water characteristic curve (SWRCs), saturated hydraulic conductivity (K sat ) and hydraulic characteristic parameters were analysed through field trials. The response relationship between changes in the soil pore size and hydraulic characteristics was explored. The results showed that the combination of biochar amendment and freezing-thawing significantly increased the soil micro pore size (\u22650.3\u20135\u202f\u03bcm), soil voids (u003e100\u202f\u03bcm) and total porosity (TP) and thereby improved the soil water retention capacity during the melting period. In addition, the use of biochar can promote the K sat  before and after freezing-thawing. However, increases in the carbon added during the melting period decreased the value of K sat  by 3.89%, 8.12%, 13.02% and 18.14% (p\u202f \u22122 , and this effect would improve the drought resistance capacity of the soil in the spring season. The excessive application of biochar led to an imbalance between the liquid and gas phases in soil, and thus, suggested biochar should not be applied in excess amounts to avoid negative effects on the soil structure. This study revealed the response mechanism of the hydraulic characteristics of the carbon-soil mixture during the freeze-thaw period and can provide a reference for the efficient utilization of soil water resources and the prediction of soil moisture in cold and dry areas.",

        "abstract": "This study investigated the contamination levels, homologue, and congener profiles and evaluated the residue inventory of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in sediment of the Songhua River in the vicinity of cement plant. The total concentration of detected 35 PCB congeners ranged from 1.12 to 2.19\u00a0ng/g dry weight (dw) in sediment, with a mean value of 1.56\u00a0ng/g dw, and the concentration of PCBs decreased in the following order: the downstream\u2009>\u2009cement plant\u2009>\u2009upstream. The results of total organic carbon (TOC)-normalized PCB concentrations indicate that the sediments have low potential ecological risk in this area. The study results on homologue and congener of PCBs show that the emissions from cement production could be the major sources of PCBs in sediment, and the low-chlorinated PCBs will be exchanged among air, water, and sediment with increasing temperature during summer and flow to downstream with water during the wet season. The spatial density and total burden of PCBs in the surface sediments were 17.2\u00a0ng/cm(2) and 1.2\u00a0kg, respectively. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the pollution characteristics of unintentionally produced PCB emissions from cement industry by means of monitoring sediment samples. ",

Modeling the indicative PCBs (CB28, CB101, CB153, and CB180) revealed spatiotemporal trends in atmospheric transport, gas/particle partitioning, and primary and secondary fractionation effects. These included the inference that the Westerlies and East Asian monsoons affect atmospheric transport patterns of PCBs by influencing the atmospheric transport time (ATT). In this study, dispersion pathways with long ATTs in winter tended to have short ones in summer and vice versa. The modeled partitioning of PCB congeners between gas and particles was mainly controlled by temperature, which can further influence the ATT. The potential for primary and secondary fractionation was explored by means of numerical simulations with single-source emissions. Within ChnGIPERM, these phenomena were mainly controlled by the temperature and soil organic carbon content. The secondary fractionation of PCBs is a slow process, with model results suggesting a timescale of several decades.",

        "title": "Assessing agricultural drought vulnerability in the Sanjiang Plain based on an improved projection pursuit model",
        "abstract": "Abstract Drought is one of the main natural disasters affecting regional agriculture, and regional agricultural drought vulnerability assessment is necessary to establish regional drought forecast, monitoring, and early warning mechanisms. The results can provide a theoretical basis for the identification of drought hazard and disaster prevention. In this study, the concept of the overall dispersion and local aggregation of projection points was proposed by Friedman and Tukey (IEEE Trans Comput 23:881\u2013890, 1974), and improvements to the projection pursuit model are proposed here by measuring discrete projection points according to the information entropy. This improved model was applied to assess the agricultural drought vulnerability of 18 counties located in the Sanjiang Plain for 4 years (2004, 2007, 2010, and 2013). Information entropy was shown to provide improved measurements in the data discreteness relative to standard deviations, and the cutoff radius was defined between 0 and ln 2, thus allowing the use of the exhaustion method to determine the cutoff radius. The overall agricultural drought vulnerability in the Sanjiang Plain area shows a downward trend over time. The main reason for this result is the reduced regional sensitivity and the increased drought resistance ability each year. Economic development speeds up the urbanization process, decreasing the proportion of agricultural population and the proportion of agricultural GDP each year and increasing the irrigation index, per capita GDP, rural per capita net income and other indicators each year. These developments decrease the sensitivity of the agricultural system, improve the adaptive capacity, and reduce the vulnerability. Spatially, the vulnerability of various regions shows some differences. The vulnerabilities of Hulin, Luobei, Youyi, and Fuyuan are the lowest and showed a downward trend over time. The sensitivities of these regions were also low; the population density, the proportion of agricultural population and other sensitive indicators were significantly smaller than those for other regions. Furthermore, the drought threat is small, the region has many state-owned farms, the economic situation is good, and the drought resistance ability is strong. The vulnerabilities of Baoqing, Muling, Raohe, and Tongjiang are moderate, with high sensitivities but strong adaptive capacity. The vulnerabilities of Yilan, Jidong, Mishan, Fujin, and Boli have changed greatly, mainly due to the rapid economic development in recent years, increasing the agricultural drought resistance. The vulnerabilities of Tangyuan, Suibin, Jixian, Huachuan, and Huanan are the highest, and with little change, these regions are highly sensitive and prone to drought. In addition, the regional economic development level is relatively low, and the agricultural drought resistance is not high.",

        "abstract": "Due to interference from natural factors and the intensity of human activities, the complex characteristics of the regional precipitation process have become increasingly evident, which creates a challenge for the rational development and utilisation of precipitation resources. In this perspective of complexity diagnosis, the multi-timescale variation characteristics of precipitation were analysed in the Northern Jiansanjiang Administration of Heilongjiang land reclamation, China, by the wavelet analysis method. The results showed that the most complex precipitation series was at Qinglongshan Farm. There are five significant main periods of approximately 2, 3, 4, 9 and 12 years in the seasonal and annual precipitation of Qinglongshan Farm; these periodic variation characteristics are almost identical to the periods of the EI Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomena and sunspot activity, which illustrates that climate change has a major influence on the local precipitation variation characteristics. At the same time, precipitation in summer and autumn has similar periods and a similar variation trend to the annual precipitation at Qinglongshan Farm, which indicates that the local annual precipitation variation characteristics are mainly affected by summer and autumn precipitation variation. In contrast with the harmonic analysis method based on Fourier transform, wavelet analysis has a significant advantage in terms of accurately identifying the main cycle of the hydrological time series.",

The results showed that the climate in the Sanjiang Plain experienced a significant warming trend over the past 50 years, with the temperature increasing by 1.35 \u00b0C since the 1960s. Additionally, the precipitation also exhibited certain trend characteristics, which revealed a larger difference in different areas. The annual precipitation exhibited 23-year and 12-year periodic variation characteristics, and the period with above-average annual precipitation levels is expected to continue after 2013. The spatial distributions of the mean annual precipitation for different years were different, whereas the spatial distribution of the multi-year mean precipitation was relatively uniform. The annual variation amplitude of the annual precipitation in the central area was larger than that in the south. The overall inter-annual fluctuation of the annual precipitation was relatively small with a mostly normal distribution. The results can provide guidance for scientific investigations and the reasonable use of rainfall resources in the Sanjiang Plain.",

        "abstract": "The accurate and reliable prediction of groundwater depth is the basis of the sustainable utilization of regional groundwater resources. However, the complexity of the prediction has been ignored in previous studies of regional groundwater depth system analysis and prediction, making it difficult to realize the scientific management of groundwater resources. To address this defect, taking complexity diagnosis as the research foundation, this paper proposes a new coupling forecast strategy for evaluating groundwater depth based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). The data used for complexity analysis and modelling are the monthly groundwater depth series monitoring data from 15 long-term monitoring wells from 1997 to 2007, which were collected from the Jiansanjiang Administration of Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation in China. The calculation results of the comprehensive complexity index for each groundwater depth series obtained are based on wavelet theory, fractal theory, and the approximate entropy method. The monthly groundwater depth sequence of District 8 of Farm Nongjiang, which has the highest complexity among the five farms in the Jiansanjiang Administration midland, was chosen as the modelling sample series. The groundwater depth series of District 8 of Farm Nongjiang was separated into five intrinsic mode function (IMF) sequences and a remainder sequence by applying the EMD method, which revealed that local groundwater depth has a significant one-year periodic character and an increasing trend. The RBFNN was then used to forecast and stack each EMD separation sequence. The results suggest that the future groundwater depth will remain at approximately 10 m if the past pattern of water use continues, exceeding the ideal depth of groundwater. Thus, local departments should take appropriate countermeasures to conserve groundwater resources effectively.",

        "abstract": "Based on the diversity of the agricultural system, this research calculates the planting structures of rice, maize and soybean considering the optimal eco- nomic-social-ecological aspects. Then, based on the uncertainty and randomness of the water resources system, the interval two-stage stochastic programming method, which introduces the uncertainty of the interval number, is used to calculate the groundwater exploitation and the use efficiency of surface water. The method considers the minimum cost of water as the objective of the uncertainty model for surface water and groundwater joint scheduling optimization for different planting structures. Finally, by calculating harmonious entropy, the optimal exploitation utilization interval of surface water and groundwater is determined for optimal cultivation in the Sanjiang Plain. The optimal matching of the planting structure under the economic system is suitable when the mining ratio of the surface is in 44.13%-45.45% and the exploitation utilization of groundwater is in 54.82%-66.86%, the optimal planting structure under the social system is suitable when surface water mining ratio is in 47.84%- 48.04% and the groundwater exploitation threshold is in 67.07%-72.00%. This article optimizes the economic- social-ecological-water system, which is important for the development of a water- and food-conserving society and providing a more accurate management environment.",

        "abstract": "To study the variation pattern of snow cover in seasonal frozen soil areas and the effect of related meteorological factors on the snow cover temperature, four land cover patterns (bare land, normal snow, compacted snow, and thickened snow) were created using a field test of a freezing and thawing period. The thermal state of the snow cover and its upper and lower boundary conditions were determined and combined with ground meteorological observation data, and the effect of the thermal state on the upper and lower boundaries of the snow cover was analyzed via statistical analysis and gray correlation analysis. The main meteorological factors affecting the snow cover temperature were selected, and the relationships between the stratification temperature and main meteorological factors were determined. The results show that the differences in snow melting time for different land cover patterns are small and that the snow density and snow depth have only slight effects on the melting rate. The variability of the heat fluxes of the snow layers was above the moderate degree, and the variability of snow from the surface layer to the bottom layer had an increasing-decreasing tendency. The heat exchange at the snow-frozen soil interface during the stable period was weak, and solar radiation could effectively influence the heat flux of 10 to 20 cm of snow. In the freezing period, snow cover treatment compared with bare land can significantly improved the soil temperature and increased the heat preservation effect in the following order: thickened snow u003e compacted snow u003e normal snow. When snowfall is certain, compacted snow treatment can increase the net radiation transmission within the snow layer, improve the temperature of the snow layer, and increase the heat preservation effect of the soil. The increase in snow density can increase the internal temperature variation of the snow and significantly change the snow thermal conditions. The regression relationship between the surface of the snow cover and the main meteorological factors was notable, while the model reliability for the middle and bottom layers was poor.",

Studies are needed that understand the relationship between climate change and agriculture in cold regions and to serve as references for studies of the impact of climate change on agriculture in similar areas. This paper uses Heilongjiang Province as a case study; seven test methods and mutual information were used to analyse the variation trend, abrupt changes and relationship between climate and planting structure. The following was concluded. (1) The precipitation trend was not significant; temperature showed a significant upward trend, the minimum temperature showed the sharpest increase. (2) The proportion of area planted in rice and maize showed a significant upward trend. The trend of rice was the most pronounced, the trend of wheat significantly decreased. (3) Abrupt changes in temperature occurred in the 1980s; abrupt changes in wheat were concentrated at the end of the 1990s. (4) The relationship between temperature and planting structure was stronger than that of precipitation, and the relationship between minimum temperature and planting structure was stronger than that of maximum temperature. The results show that temperature variables, especially minimum temperature, are the main factors affecting the change in planting structure in cold regions.",

        "abstract": "Droughts are natural disasters that pose significant threats to agricultural production as well as living conditions, and a spatial-temporal difference analysis of agricultural drought risk can help determine the spatial distribution and temporal variation of the drought risk within a region. Moreover, this type of analysis can provide a theoretical basis for the identification, prevention, and mitigation of drought disasters. In this study, the overall dispersion and local aggregation of projection points were based on research by Friedman and Tukey (IEEE Trans on Computer 23:881\u2013890, 1974). In this work, high-dimensional samples were clustered by cluster analysis. The clustering results were represented by the clustering matrix, which determined the local density in the projection index. This method avoids the problem of determining a cutoff radius. An improved projection pursuit model is proposed that combines cluster analysis and the projection pursuit model, which offer advantages for classification and assessment, respectively. The improved model was applied to analyze the agricultural drought risk of 13 cities in Heilongjiang Province over 6 years (2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014). The risk of an agricultural drought disaster was characterized by 14 indicators and the following four aspects: hazard, exposure, sensitivity, and resistance capacity. The spatial distribution and temporal variation characteristics of the agricultural drought risk in Heilongjiang Province were analyzed. The spatial distribution results indicated that Suihua, Qigihar, Daqing, Harbin, and Jiamusi are located in high-risk areas, Daxing\u2019anling and Yichun are located in low-risk areas, and the differences among the regions were primarily caused by the aspects exposure and resistance capacity. The temporal variation results indicated that the risk of agricultural drought in most areas presented an initially increasing and then decreasing trend. A higher value for the exposure aspect increased the risk of drought, whereas a higher value for the resistance capacity aspect reduced the risk of drought. Over the long term, the exposure level of the region presented limited increases, whereas the resistance capacity presented considerable increases. Therefore, the risk of agricultural drought in Heilongjiang Province will continue to exhibit a decreasing trend.",

        "abstract": "A multi-scale assessment framework for assessing and comparing the water resource sustainability based on the ecological footprint (EF) is introduced. The study aims to manage the water resource from different views in Heilongjiang Province. First of all, from the scale of each city, the water ecological carrying capacity (ECC) was calculated from 2000 to 2011, and map the spatial distribution of the recent 3\u00a0years which show that, the water ecological carrying capacity (ECC) is uneven and has a downward trend year by year. Then, from the perspective of the five secondary partition basins in Heilongjiang Province, the paper calculated the ecological carrying capacity (ECC), the ecological footprint (EF) and ecological surplus and deficit (S&D) situation of water resources from 2000 to 2011, which show that the ecological deficit situation is more prominent in Nenjiang and Suifenhe basins which are in an unsustainable development state. Finally, from the perspective of the province, the paper calculated the ecological carrying capacity (ECC), the ecological footprint (EF) and ecological S&D of water resources from 2000 to 2011 in Heilongjiang Province, which show that the ecological footprint (EF) is in the rising trend, and the correlation coefficient between the ecological carrying capacity (ECC) and the precipitation is 0.8. There are 5 years of unsustainable development state in Heilongjiang. The proposed multi-scale assessment of WEF aims to evaluate the complex relationship between water resource supply and consumption in different spatial scales and time series. It also provides more reasonable assessment result which can be used by managers and regulators.",

        "abstract": "Heilongjiang Province is a major grain production base in China, and its agricultural development plays an important role in China\u2019s social economy. Drought and flood events are the primary disasters in Heilongjiang Province and have considerable impacts on agriculture. In this study, relatively complete monthly precipitation data from 26 meteorological stations in Heilongjiang Province during the period of 1958\u20132013 were analyzed using the standardized precipitation index (SPI) combined with principal component analysis, Mann\u2013Kendall trend analysis and Morlet wavelet analysis to determine the spatial and temporal distributions of drought and flood events in this province. The results were as follows: (1) the whole of Heilongjiang exhibited an aridity trend. In northern Heilongjiang, spring and summer experienced a wetting trend, and autumn and winter experienced an aridity trend. (2) The SPI3 exhibited 8- and 16-year periodic variation characteristics in spring, 10- and 22-year periodic variation characteristics in summer, and 10- and 32-year periodic variation characteristics in autumn. In addition to the 10-year periodic variation characteristics in winter, other periodic variation characteristics were observed. (3) The increasing trend in the percentage of stations affected by flood was more obvious than that affected by drought. Therefore, Heilongjiang Province is more vulnerable to flooding. (4) The influence of drought and flood disasters in Heilongjiang Province showed a growth trend, but the flood effect was more remarkable. (5) The agricultural area affected by drought and flood disasters in Heilongjiang Province showed an increasing trend. Although there was a greater increase in flood disaster area, the main types of disasters were drought-dominated.",

The average snow porosity was 72.3% for the entire snowpack, and the changing rate of porosity ranged from 4% to 19% during the accumulation period and from 7% to 25% during the snowmelt period. The porosity of the bottom layer displayed the fastest decline and the largest range. The air temperature, snow temperature and solar radiation showed significant positive correlations with the liquid water content of the snow, and the calculated correlation coefficients were all above 0.9. In addition, relative humidity and temperature were negatively correlated. All meteorological factors studied affected the melting capacity of snow to varying degrees. This study included the design and implementation of snow experiments on bare land under natural conditions as well as measurements of snow parameters in detailed snowpack layers and explained the characteristics of snow parameters combined with meteorological factors.",

        "abstract": "To estimate the water saving potential of an irrigation area and create a scientific water saving plan, the irrigation water use efficiency and water productivity of the Hulanhe irrigation area for 2007\u20132014 were calculated, and the water saving potentials of different water saving plans were determined from the perspectives of engineering and crop water saving. The results showed that the evapotranspiration calculated from the surface energy balance algorithm for land model (SEBAL) agreed well with the measured results. The irrigation water use efficiency in the Hulanhe irrigation area was positively correlated with precipitation of irrigated land and was negatively correlated with the net irrigation water volume. The engineering water saving potential ranges for periods of 5, 8, 11, and 15\u00a0years were (1.702\u2009\u00d7\u2009108, 5.103\u2009\u00d7\u2009108)\u00a0m3, (1.783\u2009\u00d7\u2009108, 5.184\u2009\u00d7\u2009108)\u00a0m3, (1.865\u2009\u00d7\u2009108, 5.266\u2009\u00d7\u2009108)\u00a0m3, and (2.301\u2009\u00d7\u2009108, 5.702\u2009\u00d7\u2009108)\u00a0m3, respectively, and the water saving potential increased year over year. Low amounts of precipitation of irrigated land corresponded with small amounts of net irrigation water and greater water saving potential. Based on the cumulative frequency of the water productivity calculated for the Hulanhe irrigation area from 2007 to 2014, the target water productivity for short (50% of the multi-year average cumulative water productivity) and long (70% of the multi-year average cumulative water productivity) terms were 1.03 kg/m3 and 1.22\u00a0kg/m3, respectively, and the cumulative crop water saving potentials for short and long terms were 1.18\u2009\u00d7\u2009108 and 2.74\u2009\u00d7\u2009108\u00a0m3, respectively.

To scientifically analyze its economic efficiency, this paper employs a projection pursuit clustering model based on the real-coded accelerated genetic algorithm to reduce the number of output index systems for each year, and the relative economic efficiency is obtained for 13 cities in Heilongjiang Province during the period 2007\u20132012 using a data envelopment analysis (DEA) model. The spatial distribution regulation is described based on the average efficiency derived for the period 2007\u20132012. Finally, the output values are optimized for ineffective cities under the optimization principle according to the 2012 values. The results show that the output index system is different for each year. Most cities exhibit comprehensive effectiveness, and the development of water conservancy is generally good. The spatial distribution regulation of economic efficiency tends to be high in the south and low in the north because it is related to local economic development and water policies. To achieve comprehensive effectiveness, the output indices need to be adjusted. This study assists with the promotion of efficient development plans for water conservancy systems and the economic efficiency of water conservancy investment in Heilongjiang Province.",

        "title": "Spatiotemporal analysis of the agricultural drought risk in Heilongjiang Province, China",
        "abstract": "Droughts are natural disasters that pose significant threats to agricultural production as well as living conditions, and a spatial-temporal difference analysis of agricultural drought risk can help determine the spatial distribution and temporal variation of the drought risk within a region. Moreover, this type of analysis can provide a theoretical basis for the identification, prevention, and mitigation of drought disasters. In this study, the overall dispersion and local aggregation of projection points were based on research by Friedman and Tukey (IEEE Trans on Computer 23:881\u2013890, 1974). In this work, high-dimensional samples were clustered by cluster analysis. The clustering results were represented by the clustering matrix, which determined the local density in the projection index. This method avoids the problem of determining a cutoff radius. An improved projection pursuit model is proposed that combines cluster analysis and the projection pursuit model, which offer advantages for classification and assessment, respectively. The improved model was applied to analyze the agricultural drought risk of 13 cities in Heilongjiang Province over 6\u00a0years (2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014). The risk of an agricultural drought disaster was characterized by 14 indicators and the following four aspects: hazard, exposure, sensitivity, and resistance capacity. The spatial distribution and temporal variation characteristics of the agricultural drought risk in Heilongjiang Province were analyzed. The spatial distribution results indicated that Suihua, Qigihar, Daqing, Harbin, and Jiamusi are located in high-risk areas, Daxing\u2019anling and Yichun are located in low-risk areas, and the differences among the regions were primarily caused by the aspects exposure and resistance capacity. The temporal variation results indicated that the risk of agricultural drought in most areas presented an initially increasing and then decreasing trend. A higher value for the exposure aspect increased the risk of drought, whereas a higher value for the resistance capacity aspect reduced the risk of drought. Over the long term, the exposure level of the region presented limited increases, whereas the resistance capacity presented considerable increases. Therefore, the risk of agricultural drought in Heilongjiang Province will continue to exhibit a decreasing trend.",

        "abstract": "Cultivating rice will get both obvious economic and social benefits, but extending the paddy field area blindly and extensive irrigation water management mode have also brought some negative effects. Therefore, determining the scale of paddy field development reasonably has become an important issue in the planning of regional farming. The future of the paddy field appropriate development scale was analyzed and forecasted in Jiansanjiang Administration, and indicates that the local soil and water resources have the condition to develop the paddy field area. In addition, we calculated the rice comprehensive gross irrigation quota of different planning years, and showed that the Jiansanjiang Administration should reduce paddy field area appropriately to 2010\u20132015 level; the local paddy field area and the proportion will show a trend of gradual increase during 2015\u20132030. By 2030, the local suitable development scale of paddy field will reach 386,153 ha, back to 78.6 % of the paddy field area of 2009, which fully illustrates the constraint effect of water resources on rice production. The suitable area of paddy field and its growing proportion put forward in this paper offered macroscopic guidance for the local development of water-saving agriculture and the adjustment of agricultural planting structure.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the self-adaptive artificial fish swarm algorithm (SAAFSA) is used to optimize the coarse graining of segment numbers, which are used in the Lempel-Ziv complexity algorithm. This approach improves the Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) algorithm of equal probability coarse graining. As a case study, the complexities of monthly series of groundwater depth were analyzed at seven farms in the Hongxinglong Administration. GIS technology was used to create spatial distributions of monthly groundwater depths. A projection pursuit model based on the SAAFSA was established and used for complexity attribution analysis at selected farms with different degrees of complexity. The three selected farms, Hongqiling, 852, and Youyi, each represent a certain degree of complexity. Further analysis shows that precipitation, evaporation, temperature, and human activities are the primary factors that cause complexity variations in local groundwater depth. The results reveal the evolution of the complexity characteristics of local groundwater depth and provide scientific evidence for the need to effectively allocate regional water resources. Additionally, the proposed method can be applied in complexity analyses of other hydrologic features, as well as in research regarding nonlinear time series in economic, engineering, medical, and signal analyses.",

        "abstract": "Constructing a reasonable evaluation index system is important for characterizing water and land resources and for ecological restoration. To solve random and incomplete problems using a traditional evaluation index system, a novel model for evaluating regional agricultural water resources using a resilience index system was proposed. In addition, an new method for an evaluation index system and the filtering of key indicators were investigated. Based on the structural characteristics of a regional agricultural water resource system (AWRS), the model for an evaluation index system was built by constructing a hierarchical indicator architecture using a hierarchical framework model. The index weight was calculated using the importance of the criteria based on the inter criteria correlation (CRITIC). Then, index completeness was ensured using principal component analysis, and the reliability of the results was tested using the analytic hierarchy process. The model was applied to the Jiansanjiang Administration of Agricultural Reclamation in Heilongjiang, China. The main results included the following: (1) the index was optimized from 46 to 32, which identified the key indicators that affect the resilience of the Jiansanjiang Administration AWRS, and (2) an evaluation index system was constructed with a completeness of 85.6%. The results of this study provide an important and practical model for studying the resilience of related resources and environmental fields.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In accordance with national policies, the Jiansanjiang Administration of Heilongjiang Province in China has assumed a heavy task of grain production in recent years. The spatial matching status of water and land resources is a prerequisite for grain production. To analyze the potential for grain production objectively, the matching characteristics of agricultural water resources and land resources in Jiansanjiang Administration were analyzed for this paper. The spatial distribution pattern of the water and land resources was analyzed, and the amount of broadly-defined agricultural water resources (BAWR) and cultivated area were introduced as the water resource and land resource quantity parameters, respectively. The Gini coefficient model for agricultural water and land resource matching and the model for measuring the matching index between the BAWR and land resources (MIBAWRLR) were then constructed to evaluate the degree of matching between agricultural water and land resources in Jiansanjiang Administration and 15 farms in the region. Based on the Cobb-Douglas all-factor production function, the input\u2013output model of agricultural production was built, with the grain yield per hectare used as the explained variable and basic, technological, and natural factors as the explaining variables. The results are as follows: \u2460 The results of the MIBAWRLR indicate that the matching situation between agricultural water resources and land resources in Jiansanjiang Administration has improved, which was consistent with the results of the Gini coefficient model. The matching situation on the farms of Jiansanjiang Administration worsened from south to north, and the spatial matching pattern was consistent with the spatial distribution of the proportion between blue water and green water at each farm, i.e., the matching situation on a farm with a high proportion of blue water was satisfactory. \u2461 According to the input\u2013output model of agricultural production, introducing the BAWR into the established models as the characteristic parameter of water resource quantity is scientific and reasonable.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The assessment of changes in the precipitation over a region is an important task that is significant for climate modeling and for understanding and monitoring natural hazards and hydrological cycle characteristics. However, the accuracies of gridded precipitation data sets should be evaluated and examined in reference to ground information and observations, as these data can be affected by systematic errors. Therefore, the current study was carried out to evaluate the performances of long-term gridded data sets (from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC), Climate Research Unit (CRU) and University of Delaware (UDEL)) with station-based precipitation data obtained from the National Meteorological Administration (NMA) over Heilongjiang Province in Northeast China for the period from 1961 to 2005. For this purpose, this study adopted spatial comparisons among the data sets, the precipitation concentration index and drought frequency analysis based on the standardized precipitation index to evaluate the performances of these data sets in the entire study area. The results indicate that on spatial scales, the gridded data sets showed higher amounts of annual precipitation at most stations at the spatial scale than the NMA. The spatial correlations among the GPCC, UDEL and NMA were in good agreement compared with the CRU. The annual and seasonal precipitation concentration indexes suggested that the gridded data sets and station-based precipitation exhibited an irregular pattern, as 97% of the stations showed an extremely irregular pattern in the study area during the selected time period. The seasonal results of the precipitation concentration index showed that the gridded data products indicated that all of the stations exhibited irregular precipitation distributions (except during the summer), while the in situ station data indicated that most of the stations had a uniform pattern in the winter and summer. In the summer, the UDEL results were more similar to those of the NMA than those of the CRU and GPCC. The analysis based on gridded data sets revealed that 22\u201341% of the stations experienced a non-significant negative trend compared with the observed precipitation data sets. The drought frequency analysis based on in situ and gridded data was comparable. This study also revealed a new challenge regarding the utilization of gridded data sets due to discrepancies in the results. Therefore, it is very important to minimize these discrepancies by quantifying their uncertainties, identifying raw data systematic error structures, and applying satellite-based data to improve the quality of data in the region.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Songhua River Basin (SRB) plays a vital role in supplying water resources to northeast China. This river has a substantial effect on agricultural grain producing region. Therefore, the current study was carried out to evaluate the performances of multiple hydrological models driven by bias corrected precipitation estimates from a group of General Circulation Models (GCMs). The variations in discharge obtained from multiple hydrological models were also analyzed. For this purpose, bias correction methods for GCMs and five hydrological models, lumped rainfall runoff (Nedbor Afstromnings Model (NAM), GRJ4), semi-distributed (the Water Evaluation and Planning tool (WEAP), HBV), and the distributed (Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)) were used in the SRB. Before applying the bias correction method, raw GCMs were also plotted against observational data. The results revealed that none of GCM performed well against observational data. The results also showed that quantile mapping method corrects the biases of GCMs better than daily and monthly scale factors. Distributed and semi-distributed hydrological models performed better than lumped rainfall runoff models in the selected study area of SRB. By forcing hydrological models with bias corrected precipitation data, the differences in the simulated discharge by SWAT, HBV, NAM, GR4J and WEAP were \u22123%, \u22122%, \u22124%, \u22127 and +3, respectively, when compared with observed discharge. The results also show that the overall performance of SWAT, HBV, NAM, and WEAP was better than GRJ4. The results also suggest that the application of multiple hydrological models is necessary to make improvements in the planning and management of agricultural and water resources in the SRB region.",

For this purpose, statistical analysis (variation coefficient, the auto-correlation coefficient, sequential Mann\u2013Kendall\u2019s test) and a proposed method for distinguishing hydrological periods (described in methodology section) were applied. The results revealed that all rivers reflect moderate variability. The results of auto-correlation displayed that the river flow observed at Astore gauging station only indicated independency, while for Gilgit, Hunza and Kachura guaging at Indus River exhibited 2, 2, 4-year lag. The mutation analysis indicated that after 1980, the change point occurred at all UIB rivers. During analysis, it was also observed that river regimes have the same hydrological periods (i.e., 4), but with different dates of occurrence. The Gilgit River showed a low high-flow hydrological period compared to Astore, Hunza and Kachora (Indus). This difference may be due to the river\u2019s own area natural conditions. The current analysis may be helpful for planning and management of water resources, designing of hydraulic structures and to make better policies in response to agricultural water requirement downstream of UIB River.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   According to the multi-parameter evaluation of groundwater quality, an evaluation model of groundwater quality based on the improved Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) was proposed to resolve fuzziness of the water quality evaluation and incompatibility of water parameters. A training sample set and testing sample set were randomly generated according to the classification standards of groundwater quality, then Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) was used to optimize the input weights and thresholds of hidden-layer neurons of the ELM; thus, the CSA-ELM evaluation model of groundwater quality was constructed based on optimization of the ELM by the CSA. Base on the training sample set and testing sample set, the CSA-ELM model was tested. The test results indicate that the evaluating precision and generalization ability of the CSA-ELM model reach a high level and can be used for comprehensive evaluations of groundwater quality. The Jiansanjiang Administration in Heilongjiang Province, China, was used as an example; the groundwater quality of 15 farms in this region was evaluated based on the CSA-ELM model. The groundwater quality in this region was generally good, and the groundwater quality appeared to have spatial distribution characteristics. Compared with the Nemerow Index Method (NIM), the CSA-ELM evaluation model of groundwater quality is more reasonable and can be used for the comprehensive evaluation of groundwater quality. The stability of the NIM, ELM model, back propagation (BP) model and CSA-ELM model was analyzed using the theory of serial number summation and Spearmanu0027s correlation coefficient. The stability of the NIM and BP model in groundwater quality evaluation was poor, while the stability of the ELM model and CSA-ELM model was relatively superior. The ranked results of stability are CSA-ELM model\u00a0u003e\u00a0ELM model\u00a0u003e\u00a0NIM\u00a0u003e\u00a0BP model. The reliability of the NIM, ELM model, BP model and CSA-ELM model was analyzed using the theory of distinction degree. The reliability of the NIM was not good, although its distinction degree was large; the distinction degrees of the ELM model, BP model and CSA-ELM model were close to each other. The ranked results of reliability are CSA-ELM model\u00a0u003e\u00a0ELM model\u00a0u003e\u00a0BP model. The CSA-ELM model can provide a stable and reliable evaluation method for the evaluation of related fields and thus has important practical applicability.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Precipitation complexity measurement is often overlooked in precipitation time series research. Entropy, as a measure of system complexity, can be used to diagnose the complexity of precipitation. However, it is difficult to judge the applicability of different theoretical entropy models for solving precipitation uncertainty problems. This paper introduces the distinction degree theory and the serial number sum theory to screen the optimal entropy model for precipitation complexity measurement. The optimal entropy model was used to analyze the spatiotemporal differences of monthly precipitation complexity in Heilongjiang Province, China. Possible influencing factors of precipitation complexity were also examined. The results indicated that in the complexity measurement of precipitation based on entropy theory, the stability and reliability of sample entropy was higher than those of fuzzy entropy, wavelet entropy and permutation entropy. The complexity of monthly precipitation in the selected study area significantly increased with time. The average complexity of monthly maximum precipitation, monthly average precipitation and monthly minimum precipitation were 0.665, 0.622 and 0.545, respectively, and their tendency change rates were 0.070/decade, 0.055/decade and 0.038/decade, respectively. The areas with high monthly precipitation complexity were concentrated in the central, eastern and northwest parts of the study area, and the precipitation was less predictable. Monthly precipitation in the southwest was less complex and more predictable. The highest monthly precipitation complexity was 1.012, at Hulin station, and the lowest was 0.510, at Mingshui station. The increasing complexity of monthly precipitation in the province was strongly related to local industrial and agricultural production. The superposition effects of altitude, topographic relief, change in grassland area and agricultural production formed the basic pattern of spatial differences in monthly precipitation complexity. The results may provide a scientific guidance for regional precipitation predictability measurement, effective assessment of droughts and floods, and water resources management.",

        "abstract": "Precise analysis of spatiotemporal trends of temperature, precipitation and meteorological droughts plays a key role in the sustainable management of water resources in the given region. This study first aims to detect the long-term climate (monthly/seasonally and annually) trends from the historical temperature and precipitation data series by applying Spearmen\u2019s Rho and Mann-Kendall test at 5 % significant level. The measurements of both climate variables for a total period of 49 years (1965\u20132013) were collected from the 11 different meteorological stations located in the Songhua River basin of China. Secondly, the two well-known meteorological drought indices including the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI) were applied on normalize data to detect the drought hazards at 3, 6, 9 and 12 month time scale in the study area. The analysis of monthly precipitation showed significant (p u003c 0.05) increasing trends during the winter (November and December months) season. Similarly, the results of seasonal and annual air temperature showed a significant increase from 1 \u00b0C to 1.5 \u00b0C for the past 49 years in the basin. According to the Sen\u2019s slope estimator, the rate of increment in seasonal temperature slope (0.26 \u00b0C/season) and precipitation (9.02 mm/season) were greater than annual air temperature (0.04 \u00b0C/year) and precipitation (1.36 mm/year). By comparing the results of SPI and RDI indices showed good performance at 9 (r = 0.96, p u003c 0.01) and 12 (r = 0.99, p u003c 0.01) month drought analysis. However, the yearly drought analysis at over all stations indicated that a 20 years were under dry conditions in entire study area during 49 years. We found the extreme dry and wet conditions in the study region were prevailing during the years of 2001 and 2007, and 1994 and 2013, respectively. Overall, the analysis and quantifications of this study provides a mechanism for the policy makers to mitigate the impact of extreme climate and drought conditions in order to improve local water resources management in the region.",

In this study, the research entropy base concept was applied to investigate spatial and temporal variability of the precipitation during 1964\u20132013 in the Songhua River basin of Heilongjiang Province in China. Sample entropy was applied on precipitation data on a monthly, seasonally, annually, decade scale and the number of rainy days for each selected station. Intensity entropy and apportionment entropy were used to calculate the variability over individual year and decade, respectively. Subsequently, Spearman\u2019s Rho and Mann\u2013Kendall tests were applied to observe for trends in the precipitation time series. The statistics of sample disorder index showed that the precipitation during February (mean 1.09, max. 1.26 and min. 0.80), April (mean 1.12, max. 1.29 and min. 0.99) and July (mean 1.10, max. 1.20 and min. 0.98) contributed significantly higher than those of other months. Overall, the contribution of the winter season was considerably high with a standard deviation of 0.10. The precipitation variability on decade basis was observed to increase from decade 1964\u20131973 and 1994\u20132003 with a mean value of decadal apportionment disorder index 0.023 and 0.053, respectively. In addition, the Mann\u2013Kendall test value (1.90) showed a significant positive trend only at the Shangzhi station.",

        "abstract": "Numerous drought indices based on single or multiple variables have been developed for the assessment of drought. This study aimed to detect the variability of droughts by applying four drought indices, the standardized precipitation index, the reconnaissance drought index, the standardized precipitation evaporative drought index and the effective drought index, at five meteorological stations in the Songhua River basin (SRB) in China during 1962\u20132013 and at two meteorological stations in the Indus River basin (IRB) during 1980\u20132013 using different timescales (3, 6, 9 and 12 months). Moreover, a Mann\u2212Kendall trend test at the 5% significance level was used for the assessment of drought trends in the basins. The results indicated that the 12 month data series for the SRB and the 6 month data series for the IRB were appropriate for assessing dry conditions and for comparing the drought indices. Pearsonu0027s correlation analyses between the drought indices results and the meteorological variables revealed that the standardized precipitation index is a better drought index for the assessment of drought in the SRB (r\u00a0=\u00a00.99). The results also showed that the standardized precipitation evaporative drought index versus the reconnaissance drought index is better at identifying drought in the IRB with a Pearsonu0027s correlation value r\u00a0of\u00a00.98. Severe and extremely dry conditions prevailed between 1990 and 2001 in the SRB, and there were extreme drought conditions with an intensity of \u22122.00 in the IRB during 2001\u20132002. Overall, this study provides insights into choosing the appropriate time interval and drought index for a specific region to identify the severity of droughts.",

In view of the subjectivity and uncertainty of parameter selection in entropy theory research, this paper combines a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with entropy theory to improve the traditional parameter selection method and the accuracy and reliability of the complexity measurement results. We combined PSO and multiscale entropy (MSE) to analyze the complexity of monthly precipitation series from 11 stations in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China, and the complexity results were classified into three levels. Harbin, Shuangcheng, Yilan, and Fangzheng are level I areas; Wuchang, Tonghe, Yanshou, and Binxian are level II areas; and Bayan, Mulan, and Shangzhi are level III areas. We selected the mountainous area ratio, water area ratio, GDP, and grain production as indicators that influence the complexity of local precipitation. The results showed that the correlation between the precipitation complexity and terrain was obvious, the impact of the water area ratio on the precipitation complexity was small, and the GDP and grain production were mostly negatively correlated with precipitation. These results reveal the spatiotemporal characteristics of the precipitation complexity and the factors that potentially influence the complexity. This study provides a reference model for other complexity measures in the field of regional water resource systems and related studies.",

Based on the generation of interval numbers through statistical simulation, the ILMP model was solved using a fuzzy programming method. The model balances contradictions among economic net benefit, crop yield and water-saving in irrigation systems incorporating uncertainties in both objective functions and constraints that are based on the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater. The model was applied to Hulan River irrigation district, northeast China. Tradeoffs between various crops in different subareas under different frequencies were analyzed, and scenarios with different objectives were considered to evaluate the changing trend of irrigation water allocation.Results indicated that the ILMP model provided effective linkages between revenue/output promotion and water saving, and offers insights into tradeoffs for irrigation water management under uncertainty.",

        "abstract": "The potential influence of natural variations in a climate system on global warming can change the hydrological cycle and threaten current strategies of water management. A simulation-based linear fractional programming (SLFP) model, which integrates a runoff simulation model (RSM) into a linear fractional programming (LFP) framework, is developed for optimal water resource planning. The SLFP model has multiple objectives such as benefit maximization and water supply minimization, balancing water conflicts among various water demand sectors, and addressing complexities of water resource allocation system. Lingo and Excel programming solutions were used to solve the model. Water resources in the main stream basin of the Songhua River are allocated for 4 water demand sectors in 8 regions during two planning periods under different scenarios. Results show that the increase or decrease of water supply to the domestic sector is related to the change in population density at different regions in different target years. In 2030, the water allocation in the industrial sector decreased by 1.03\u20133.52% compared with that in 2020, while the water allocation in the environmental sector increased by 0.12\u20131.29%. Agricultural water supply accounts for 54.79\u201377.68% of total water supply in different regions. These changes in water resource allocation for various sectors were affected by different scenarios in 2020; however, water resource allocation for each sector was relatively stable under different scenarios in 2030. These results suggest that the developed SLFP model can help to improve the adjustment of water use structure and water utilization efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The shortage of water resources and the increasing competition among water users have highlighted the importance of the water allocation problem. Water availability is crucial for water resource allocation and changes frequently, leading to the necessity to predict available water. This paper develops a framework aimed to plan regional water allocations under different representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios using an interval parameter conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) two-stage stochastic programming model. This framework combines prediction and optimization to reflect climate change, the uncertainty of water system and the coordination between water resources allocation and risk. The feasibility and practicality of the framework are demonstrated by its application in a real-world case study in the Lower Songhua River Basin in northeast China. Comparison between the results of the developed model and actual conditions show that 11.61\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 8 \u202fm 3  volume of water supply can be saved after optimization, indicating that the developed model tends to allocate water in a more efficient way. The ratio of surface water to groundwater is reduced from 2:1 to 1.62:1. The proposed model has practical relevance for saving water and alleviating groundwater overexploitation. The approach is applicable to most areas with severe water shortages and groundwater overexploitation, and decision makers can determine the appropriate options for water resources allocation based on risk preferences and actual conditions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Water scarcity causes conflicts among natural resources, society and economy and reinforces the need for optimal allocation of irrigation water resources in a sustainable way. Uncertainties caused by natural conditions and human activities make optimal allocation more complex. An intuitionistic fuzzy multi-objective non-linear programming (IFMONLP) model for irrigation water allocation under the combination of dry and wet conditions is developed to help decision makers mitigate water scarcity. The model is capable of quantitatively solving multiple problems including crop yield increase, blue water saving, and water supply cost reduction to obtain a balanced water allocation scheme using a multi-objective non-linear programming technique. Moreover, it can deal with uncertainty as well as hesitation based on the introduction of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Consideration of the combination of dry and wet conditions for water availability and precipitation makes it possible to gain insights into the various irrigation water allocations, and joint probabilities based on copula functions provide decision makers an average standard for irrigation. A case study on optimally allocating both surface water and groundwater to different growth periods of rice in different subareas in Heping irrigation area, Qing\u2019an County, northeast China shows the potential and applicability of the developed model. Results show that the crop yield increase target especially in tillering and elongation stages is a prevailing concern when more water is available, and trading schemes can mitigate water supply cost and save water with an increased grain output. Results also reveal that the water allocation schemes are sensitive to the variation of water availability and precipitation with uncertain characteristics. The IFMONLP model is applicable for most irrigation areas with limited water supplies to determine irrigation water strategies under a fuzzy environment.",

        "title": "The Critical Depth of Freeze-Thaw Soil under Different Types of Snow Cover",
        "abstract": "Snow cover is the most common upper boundary condition influencing the soil freeze-thaw process in the black soil farming area of northern China. Snow is a porous dielectric cover, and its unique physical properties affect the soil moisture diffusion, heat conduction, freezing rate and other variables. To understand the spatial distribution of the soil water-heat and the variable characteristics of the critical depth of the soil water and heat, we used field data to analyze the freezing rate of soil and the extent of variation in soil water-heat in a unit soil layer under bare land (BL), natural snow (NS), compacted snow (CS) and thick snow (TS) treatments. The critical depth of the soil water and heat activity under different snow covers were determined based on the results of the analysis, and the variation fitting curve of the difference sequences on the soil temperature and water content between different soil layers and the surface 5-cm soil layer were used to verify the critical depth. The results were as follows: snow cover slowed the rate of soil freezing, and the soil freezing rate under the NS, CS and TS treatments decreased by 0.099 cm/day, 0.147 cm/day and 0.307 cm/day, respectively, compared with that under BL. In addition, the soil thawing time was delayed, and the effect was more significant with increased snow cover. During freeze-thaw cycles, the extent of variation in the water and heat time series in the shallow soil was relatively large, while there was less variation in the deep layer. There was a critical stratum in the vertical surface during hydrothermal migration, wherein the critical depth of soil water and heat change gradually increased with increasing snow cover. The variance in differences between the surface layer and both the soil water and heat in the different layers exhibited \u201csteady-rising-steady\u201d behavior, and the inflection point of the curve is the critical depth of soil freezing and thawing. This critical layer is a demarcation point between frozen soil and non-frozen soil, delineating the boundary between soil water and heat migration and non-migration. Furthermore, with increasing snow cover thickness and increasing density, the critical depth gradually increased.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This study investigates the response mechanisms between soil water-heat transfer and environmental factors during freeze-thaw periods and establishes soil water-heat transfer functions in a cold region. Based on field-measured values of soil temperature and liquid-phase water content collected at an automatic weather station in the black soil area of the Songnen plain, the influence of the cumulative negative temperature on the soil freezing depth was analyzed under different snow cover conditions. A gray correlation analysis method was used to screen the environmental factors and determine those with the most influence on changes in soil water-heat transfer processes. Then, soil water-heat transfer functions were established between the selected environmental factors and soil temperature, the liquid-phase soil water content. The results showed that during the freezing and thawing period, snow cover hindered the effects of the cumulative temperature on the thickness of the frozen soil layer. Additionally, the time of occurrence of the maximum freezing depth under natural snow (NS), compacted snow (CS) and thickened snow (TS) treatments was delayed 7, 12 and 20\u202fdays, respectively, compared with that under bare land (BL). The correlation between atmospheric temperature, total radiation and soil temperature was relatively high, and this effect decreased with the increasing of snow cover. The main driving factors of variations in the liquid-phase water content were ambient humidity and saturated vapor pressure, and the effects of these factors decreased with increasing soil depth and snow cover thickness, similarly. In the active frozen layer, the correlation coefficients of the soil water-heat transfer functions were relatively high, and the function model can be tested by the significance ( P  2  values of functions below the active layer were relatively low, and the soil water-heat transfer in the area below the active layer was less affected by the environment. This study reveals the characteristics of energy transfer and mass transfer in a composite system of atmospheric factors and frozen soil under snow cover conditions. It provides a reference for accurate forecasting and the efficient utilization of soil water and heat resources in cold and arid regions.",

        "abstract": "Based on a winter field experiment between 2016 and 2017, four treatments (bare land (BL), natural snowfall coverage (NS), 5-cm-deep straw + natural snowfall coverage (SC5), and 10-cm-deep straw + natural snowfall coverage (SC10)) were established to determine the effects of the different treatments on soil temperature at the soil surface and at depths of 10 cm, 20 cm, and 30 cm.  The environmental factors of ambient temperature, ambient humidity, water vapor pressure, 10-min wind speed, total radiation, net radiation, and long wave radiation were obtained from the weather station in the study area.  Through correlation, multiple regression, and stepwise regression analysis, models for dynamic simulation of the tillage-layer soil temperature were constructed for analyzing the relation between tillage-layer soil temperature and environmental factors.  The results showed that the environmental factors were all significantly correlated with tillage-layer temperature at the 0.01 level; when the impacts of other environmental factors were excluded, the correlations decreased significantly.  The dynamic simulation models for tillage-layer soil temperature under different coverage conditions were different, and the larger the coverage amount, the fewer the environmental factors that could affect the tillage-layer temperature.  The coefficients of determination of the prediction results of the dynamic models for the tillage-layer soil temperature under the four treatments (BL, NS, SC5, and SC10) were 0.8385, 0.7110, 0.7283, and 0.6216, respectively.  The prediction had a high accuracy and can accurately depict the dynamic changes of the tillage-layer soil temperature.  The results provided a theoretical basis for the efficient utilization of farmland soil water and heat resources.Keywords: farmland cover condition, frozen-thawed soil, tillage-layer temperature, impact factor, dynamic simulation, stepwise regressionDOI: 10.25165/j.ijabe.20181102.3068Citation: Fu Q, Ma Z A, Wang E L, Li T X, Hou R J.

        "abstract": "Truncated O-glycans, including Tn-antigen, sTn-antigen, T-antigen, sT-antigen, are incomplete glycosylated structures and their expression occur frequently in tumor tissue. The study aims to evaluate the abundance of each truncated O-glycans and its clinical significance in postoperative patients with localized clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). We used immunohistochemical testing to analyze the expression of truncated O-glycans in tumor specimens from 401 patients with localized ccRCC. Truncated-O-glycan score was built by integrating the expression level of Tn-, sTn- and sT-antigen. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analysis were done to compare clinical outcomes in subgroups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was applied to assess the impact of prognostic factors on overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). The results identified Tn-, sTn-, sT-antigen as independent prognosticators. The OS and RFS were shortened among the 198 (49.4%) patients with high Truncated-O-glycan score than among the 203 (50.6%) patients with low score (hazard ratio for OS, 7.060; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.765 to 18.027;  <0.001; for RFS, 4.612; 95% CI: 2.141 to 9.931;  <0.001). There is no difference between low-risk patients and high-risk patients in low score group ( = 0.987). High-risk patients with low score showed a better prognosis than low-risk patient with high score ( = 0.029). The Truncated-O-glycan score showed better prognostic value for OS (AUC: 0.739,  = 0.003) and RFS (AUC: 0.719,  = 0.003) than TNM stage. In summary, the high Truncated-O-glycan score could predict adverse clinical outcome in localized ccRCC patients after surgery.",

        "abstract": "We constructed a three-molecule score based on the expression of Notch pathway molecules: Jagged1, intracellular Notch1 (ICN1) and Hes1 (JIH score). To assess prognostic value of the JIH score in non-metastasis clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), we identified 467 patients who underwent nephrectomy during 2008-2009 as our study population. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the expression of these three molecules. Cox regression models were applied to construct the JIH score, while Kaplan-Meier methods, multivariate analyses and nomogram were used to explore prognostic value of the JIH score. Our result confirmed that JIH score was an independent prognosticator for both overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Survival analyses showed that a higher JIH score indicated worse clinical outcomes (JIH score 3: 58.3% and 58.0% for 6-year OS and RFS, respectively; JIH score 0: 96.7% and 91.6% for 6-year OS and RFS, respectively). Nomograms based on JIH score and other conventional clinicopathological features had a better capability in predicting patients with pT1 stage disease for both OS and RFS (84.6% and 83.9%, respectively). The JIH score is a novel prognosticator representing activation of Notch pathway for non-metastasis ccRCC, and raises an alternative strategy for excavating potential biomarkers for signal pathways.",

The objective of this study is to assess the prognostic effect of TINs and its impact on adjuvant chemotherapy benefits in muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). A total of 142 MIBC patients from Zhongshan Hospital, 119 MIBC patients from FUSCC, and 405 MIBC patients from TCGA cohort were enrolled in the study. TINs were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining of CD66b or the CIBERSORT method. Patients with high TINs had a significantly poorer overall survival ( = 0.001,  < 0.001, and  = 0.002, respectively) in the three sets. In the multivariate analysis, the presence of high TINs (HR = 2.122,  = 0.007; HR = 3.807,  < 0.001; HR = 2.104,  = 0.001; respectively) was identified as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in the three sets. More importantly, Low TINs patients had significantly longer overall survival in patients without ACT in the three sets. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that lymphocyte activation ( < 0.001) and T cell activation ( = 0.008) were significantly enriched in the low TINs group. In addition, TINs were negatively correlated with CD8 T cells, suggesting that the status of high-TINs was linked to the status of immunosuppression in MIBC. TINs could be used as independent prognostic factor. Low TINs identified a subgroup of MIBC patients who appeared to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Incorporation of TINs into TNM system could further stratify patients with different prognosis.",

To evaluate the association between MUC3A expression with overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with localized clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), we retrospectively detected MUC3A expression in samples of 384 postoperative localized ccRCC patients by immunohistochemistry. Median follow-up was 73 months (range: 42 - 74 mo). Overall, 41 patients died, 47 experienced recurrence. High MUC3A expression occurred in 45.8% of localized ccRCC cases, which was significantly associated with high pT-stage, high Fuhrman grade, high frequency of necrosis and LVI, and increased risk of recurrence and death (Logrank test P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). By multivariate analysis, MUC3A expression was confirmed as an adverse independent prognostic factor for OS and RFS. The prognostic accuracy of UISS, SSIGN, Leibovich models was significantly increased when MUC3A expression was integrated. Meanwhile, MUC3A was enrolled into a newly built nomogram with other factors selected by multivariate analysis. Calibration curves revealed optimal consistency between observations and prognosis. In conclusion, high MUC3A expression is an adverse prognostic biomarker for OS and RFS in postoperative localized ccRCC patients.",

However, the clinical significance of beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase II in non-metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma has not been reported up to now. Herein, our researches suggested that the expression level of beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase II was first found to be positively associated with tumor size, Fuhrman grade, lymphovascular invasion, rhabdoid differentiation, tumor necrosis and poor overall survival and recurrence-free survival of patients with non-metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma, both in training set and validation set. Moreover, beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase II expression was identified as an independent adverse prognosticator for overall survival and recurrence-free survival of patients with non-metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. Ultimately, prognostic accuracy of the nomogram integrating beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase II with other independent prognostic parameters was dramatically improved for overall survival and recurrence-free survival of patients with non-metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. Taken together, beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase II is a potential independent adverse prognostic factor for postoperative recurrence and survival, which could be developed as a useful biomarker for non-metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma by a series of further independent and retrospective studies, so as to help the postsurgical management of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma patients.",

To evaluate the association between MUC3A expression with overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with localized clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), we retrospectively detected MUC3A expression in samples of 384 postoperative localized ccRCC patients by immunohistochemistry. Median follow-up was 73 months (range: 42 - 74 mo). Overall, 41 patients died, 47 experienced recurrence. High MUC3A expression occurred in 45.8% of localized ccRCC cases, which was significantly associated with high pT-stage, high Fuhrman grade, high frequency of necrosis and LVI, and increased risk of recurrence and death (Logrank test P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). By multivariate analysis, MUC3A expression was confirmed as an adverse independent prognostic factor for OS and RFS. The prognostic accuracy of UISS, SSIGN, Leibovich models was significantly increased when MUC3A expression was integrated. Meanwhile, MUC3A was enrolled into a newly built nomogram with other factors selected by multivariate analysis. Calibration curves revealed optimal consistency between observations and prognosis. In conclusion, high MUC3A expression is an adverse prognostic biomarker for OS and RFS in postoperative localized ccRCC patients.",

        "abstract": "IFN-inducible CXCR3 ligands (ICL), namely CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11, exhibit pleiotropic roles in orchestrating immunity and angiogenesis. However, the prognosis value of them in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) was still obscure. Thus, we retrospectively used immunohistochemistry approach to evaluate the impact of these ligands on recurrence and survival of non-metastatic clear cell RCC (ccRCC) patients after nephrectomy. We systemically built a prespecified ICL score based on these ligands, and found specimens with high ICL score were prone to possess high Fuhrman grade, necrosis, and high-risk level of SSIGN. Moreover, ICL score stratified patients into different risk subgroups, and remained an independent adverse prognosticator for overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Meanwhile, in TCGA database, the increasing ICL mRNA predicted poor survival and early recurrence. Furthermore, after adding ICL score into SSIGN, the C-index for OS and RFS increased from 0.705 to 0.746 and 0.712 to 0.765, respectively. In conclusion, the ICL score based on expression of CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 stratified non-metastatic ccRCC patients into different risk subgroups of recurrence and death, which might benefit preoperative risk stratification and guide immune therapy in the future.

        "abstract": "Abstract Deregulated expression of N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (GALNTs), which responsible for initiating step of mucin-type O-glycosylation, could produce abnormal truncated O-glycans and thereby exerting pivotal functions during malignant transformation. GALNT4 is one of the few isoforms preferring to catalyze partial GalNAc-glycosylated substrates and modify the sites not utilized by other known GALNTs. This study aims to evaluate the impact of GALNT4 expression on malignant transformation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization analysis were performed to assess GALNT4 and miR-9 level in clinical specimens, respectively. GALNT4 expression is markedly repressed in primary HCC tissues and reduced expression of GALNT4 is significantly associated with adverse survival of patients with HCC. Functional investigations demonstrate that repressed GALNT4 could promote migration, invasion, anoikis resistance and stemness of HCC cells in vitro as well as tumor growth in vivo. The wild-type GALNT4 could modify O-linked glycosylation on EGFR and thus modulate the activity of EGFR. Luciferase activity assay further identified microRNA-9 (miR-9) as the crucial specific arbitrator for GALNT4 expression in HCC cells. Furthermore, restoring GALNT4 expression attenuates miR-9 mediated oncogenic functions. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicates the miR-9/GALNT4 expression signature yield promising prognostic significance to refine the risk stratification of patients with HCC. In conclusions, this study establishes miR-9/GALNT4 axis as a potential adverse prognostic factor and therapeutic target for HCC patients.",

This study aims to evaluate the impact of UQCRH on recurrence and survival of 424 ccRCC patients enrolled retrospectively from a single institution after surgical resection using immunohistochemistry method. UQCRH was specifically downregulated in ccRCC, compared with papillary and chromophobe RCC. Moreover, patients with low UQCRH were prone to possess high T stage and TNM stage and associated with poor survival and early recurrence. UQCRH remained an independent favorable prognosticator for OS (Hazard rate [HR]: 0.510, 95% CI: 0.328-0.795, p=0.003) and RFS (HR: 0.506, 95% CI: 0.334-0.767, p=0.001) adjusting with other well-established factors using backward Cox model. Furthermore, in stratified subgroups, patients with low UQCRH had an increased risk of recurrence (HR: 0.452, 95% CI: 0.261-0.783, p=0.005) and mortality (HR: 0.386, 95% CI: 0.205-0.726, p=0.003) in subgroup of early TNM stage. Taken together, UQCRH is a potential independent favorable prognostic factor for recurrence and survival of patients with ccRCC after nephrectomy. ",

Here, we report a novel multifunctional sensor with high sensitivity and durability by using a buckled spider silk-like single-walled carbon nanotubes (SSL-SWNTs) film as the conducting network and a crack-shaped Au film as the sensitive transducer. Its high sensitivity is inspired by the crack-shaped structure of the spider's slit organs, while the high durability is inspired by the mechanical robustness of the spider silk. Similar to the spider's slit organs that can detect slight vibrations, our sensor also exhibits a high sensitivity especially to tiny strain. The proposed quantum tunneling model is consistent with experimental data. In addition, this sensor also responds sensitively to temperature with the sensitivity of 1.2%/\u00b0C. Because of the hierarchical structure like spider silk, this sensor possesses combined superiority of fast response (<60 ms) and high durability (>10\u202f000 cycles). We also fabricate a wearable device for monitoring various human physiological signals. It is expect that this high-performance sensor will have wide potential applications in intelligent devices, fatigue detection, body monitoring, and human-machine interfacing.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   CD4  +   T-cell activation and its subsequent induction of CD154 (CD40 ligand, CD40L) expression are pivotal in shaping both the humoral and cellular immune responses. Scaffold protein JLP regulates signal transduction pathways and molecular trafficking inside cells, thus represents a critical component in maintaining cellular functions.  Its role in regulating CD4  +   T-cell activation and CD154 expression, however, is unclear. Here, we demonstrated expression of JLP in mouse tissues of lymph nodes, thymus, spleen, and also CD4  +   T cells. Using CD4+ T cells from jlp-deficient and jlp-wild-type mice, we demonstrated that JLP-deficiency impaired T-cell proliferation, IL-2 production, and CD154 induction upon TCR stimulations, but had no impacts on the expression of other surface molecules such as CD25, CD69, and TCR. These observed impaired T-cell functions in the jlp-/- CD4  +   T cells were associated with defective NF-AT activation and Ca 2   +   influx, but not the MAPK, NF-\u03baB, as well as AP-1 signaling pathways. Our findings indicated that, for the first time, JLP plays a critical role in regulating CD4 +  T cells response to TCR stimulation partly by mediating the activation of TCR-initiated Ca 2 +  /NF-AT.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Plasma facing materials (PFMs) face one of the most serious challenges in fusion reactors, including unprecedented harsh environment such as 14.1\u202fMeV neutron and transmutation gas irradiation at high temperature. Tungsten (W) is considered to be one of the most promising PFM, however, virtually insolubility of helium (He) in W causes new material issues such as He bubbles and W \u201cfuzz\u201d microstructure. In our previous studies, we presented a new strategy using nanochannel structure designed in the W film to increase the releasing of He atoms and thus to minimize the He nucleation and \u201cfuzz\u201d formation behavior. In this work, we report the further study on the diffusion of He atoms in the nanochannel W films irradiated at a high temperature of 600\u202f\u00b0C. More specifically, the temperature influences on the formation and growth of He bubbles, the lattice swelling, and the mechanical properties of the nanochannel W films were investigated. Compared with the bulk W, the nanochannel W films possessed smaller bubble size and lower bubble areal density, indicating that noticeable amounts of He atoms have been released out along the nanochannels during the high temperature irradiations. Thus, with lower He concentration in the nanochannel W films, the formation of the bubble superlattice is delayed, which suppresses the lattice swelling and reduces hardening. These aspects indicate the nanochannel W films have better radiation resistance even at high temperature irradiations.",

First, the titanium substrate undergoes gas carburizing, followed by micro-arc oxidation (MAO) to form a carbon-doped TiO2 film on the surface. The process can be described as direct oxidation of titanium carbide (O\u2192TiCx). The experimental results reveal that compared with traditional thermal annealing, this process could increase the carbon doping concentration to 6.07 at% and x to 0.24 in TiO2\u2212xCx. The TiO2\u2212xCx film exhibits a significant red-shift in the band-gap transition, a narrow band gap of 2.77 eV, and excellent photocatalytic performance, more than two times higher than that of undoped TiO2 film. This method is simple, efficient, economical, environmentally friendly, and adapts to mass production. This experimental strategy can also be used in preparing other doped elements.",

That is, by adding dispersed graphene oxide (GO) into the electroless bath, GO was reduced to Gr during co-deposition process, and formed the Cu-Gr composite coating. The surface morphologies and microstructures were characterized by using SEM, TEM, Raman, FT-IR, the mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of the coating were also evaluated. The experimental results revealed that: 1) Graphene exhibited a significant effect on the microstructure of the coating, for example, the grain size of the composite coating varied from the concentration of the added GO, and the optimal value 60\u202fmg/L showed that the smallest grain size and the highest compactness. 2) At the optimal GO concentration, the Cu-Gr coating also was of the highest mechanical properties, i.e. the hardness was 4.2 times higher than that of regular pure copper plating, and elastic modulus was increased by 26%. 3) Compared with regular pure Cu plating, the corrosion resistance of the Cu-Gr coating had a significant improvement, i.e. the E corr \u3001i corr \u3001corrosion rate (CR) and inhibition efficiency (\u03b7) were also optimized at the optimal GO concentration. It is expected that the Cu-Gr coating will have broad application prospects in the fields of electronics industry, marine engineering and military industry.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a flexible Ag/CNTs-PDMS (polydimethylsi-loxane) composite film sensor based on the novel design philosophy was prepared. Its force-electric effect mechanism is based on the generation of micro-cracks in the Ag film during external forcing, leading to resistance variation. Experimental results find that Ag film thickness has a strong influence on the sensor's sensitivity, which exhibits a tendency of first increasing and then decreasing the Ag film thickness, and also has an optimal thickness of 4.9 \u03bcm for the maximum sensitivity around 30. The sensitive mechanism can be theoretically explained by using the quantum tunneling effect. Due to the use of the wrinkled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) film, this sensor has advantages, such as high sensitivity, large strain range, good stability and durability, cheap price, and suitability for large-scale production. Preliminary applications on human-body monitoring reveal that the sensor can detect weak tremors and breathe depth and rate, and the corresponding heartbeat response. It provides possibilities to diagnose early Parkinson's disease and exploit an early warning system for sudden infant death syndrome and sleep apnea in adults. In addition, as a force-electric effect sensor, it is expected to have broad application areas, such as a man-machine cooperation, and a robotic system.",

        "abstract": "Because of its high strength and high toughness, graphene has been widely used in mechanical reinforced composites. In general, the mechanical enhancement depends mainly on the properties of graphene itself and the number of surface chemical functional groups attached on it. In this paper, we report a method to improve the mechanical performance of polymer by using a kind of functionalized reduced graphene oxide (F-RGO), i.e., the F-RGO is prepared by chemical treatment, and then the F-RGO/polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) composite films are obtained by spin coating. Because the chemical treatment can increase the number of functional groups on the surface and edge of F-RGO, these functional groups make the F-RGO sheets strongly coupled with PVDF molecules, so as to achieve the purpose of mechanical enhancement. The experimental results reveal that the mechanical properties of the F-RGO/PVDF composite films are improved for 42% times, when comparing with regular RGO/PVDF composite films.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a process to synthesize a novel photocatalyst called rutile-mixed anatase nanosheets with dominant {001} facets from a hydrothermal route by using a solution mixed with Ti(OC4H9)4, HF, NH4F and H2O. The crystal structure, micrographs, chemical compositions, and photocatalytic property are characterized and evaluated by using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis spectrophotometer, and fluorescence spectrophotometer. The experimental results reveal that (1) the addition of NH4F played a crucial role, because it not only changes the chemical environment but also make the phase transformation from anatase to rutile. (2) Compared with the regular anatase TiO2 nanosheets with dominant {001} facets, the present novel photocatalyst exhibits a greatly enhanced photocatalyst activity, i.e., its highest level of photocatalytic activity was about four times higher than that of commercial P25 and the regular anatase TiO2 nanosheets with dominant {001} facets. The mechanism is because the formation of the rutile/anatase heterostructure enhances the separation of the photo-generated electrons and holes. It is expected that this novel photocatalyst will provide wide applications in areas of solar cells, hydrogen generation, photocatalytic environmental pollution treatment, etc.",

Via a pressureless sintering at 1500\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min, the oxygen-containing groups of electrochemically exfoliated graphene can be effectively eliminated and its intrinsic structures and properties are restored. The experimental results show that: 1) the HQG exhibits very low defect density (I D /I G \u00a0=\u00a00.16), extremely high carbon to oxygen (C/O) ratio of 25.3 and good processability in various solvents; 2) When the HQG is applied to fabricate a free-standing graphene paper (G-paper), its conductivity reaches to as high as 38460\u00a0S/m; 3) The G-paper without any binders, which is used as supercapacitor electrodes, delivers a specific capacitance of 129.0\u00a0F/g at 1\u00a0A/g, and retains 97% capacitance even after 1000 cycles.",

        "abstract": "The amount of graphene (Gr) in a composite plays a key role in enhancing the performance of the composite. In general, an indirect method, that is, by adjusting the concentration of Gr (or GO) in the electrolyte, is used to study the influence of the graphene content on the properties of copper (Cu)\u2013Gr composite foil. In this paper, we firstly propose a direct and accurate approach, that is, by using an instrumental carbon and sulfur analyzer, to determine the amount of Gr in the direct current electrodeposited Cu\u2013Gr composite foil, and also obtain the relationship between the amount of Gr in the composite foils and the concentration of GO in the electrolyte. Further, mechanical property measurements reveal that: (1) the variations in the mechanical properties (involving the elastic modulus, hardness and tensile strength) of the Cu\u2013Gr foils along with the concentration of GO in the electrolyte exhibit similar tendencies to that of the Gr content in the Cu\u2013Gr foils. (2) According to current experimental conditions, the optimal values of the mechanical properties and the amount of Gr in the foils appears at a GO concentration of 0.5 g L\u22121 in the electrolyte. (3) When the GO concentration is less than 0.5 g L\u22121, the values of the mechanical properties and the amount of Gr in the foils present an approximately linear relationship; and beyond 0.5 g L\u22121, the values become unstable and declining, which can be attributed to an agglomeration of excess GO in the electrolyte which makes it difficult to be co-deposited into the foil.",

The performance of the composite was varied with the concentrations of GO in the electrolyte. The layeru0027s microstructures were systematically characterized by SEM, TEM, Raman, FT-IR, and its micro-hardness and corrosion resistance were evaluated for getting desired properties. The experimental results revealed that: 1) the Gr could be scattered homogeneously in the Fe layer when dispersible graphene oxide (GO) was added in the electrolyte; 2) comparing with pure Fe layer, the micro-hardness and corrosion resistance of the Fe-Gr composite layer were greatly enhanced; 3) it was found that there was an optimal GO adding amount (0.4\u202fg/L) in the electrolyte, which increased the properties involving the micro-hardness up to HV 248, 2.07 times higher than that of pure iron layer (HV 120); 3.75 times of anti-corrosion rate (0.1353\u202fmmy \u22121 ) and 5.38 times of the charge transfer resistance (1456\u202f\u03a9\u202fcm 2 ) higher than that of pure iron layer (0.5076\u202fmmy \u22121 , 270.5\u202f\u03a9\u202fcm 2 ).",

        "abstract": "In this work, we established a one-step strategy to synthesize three-dimensional porous graphitic biomass carbon (PGBC) from bamboo char (BC), and studied its electrochemical performance as electrode materials for supercapacitors. Using potassium ferrate (K2FeO4) to fulfil the synchronous carbonization and graphitization of bamboo carbon, this method is less time-demanding, highly efficient and pollution-free, when compared with a conventional two-step strategy. The as-prepared PGBC sample possessed a porous structure with a large specific surface area (1732 m2 g\u22121) and abundant micropores, as well as a high graphitization degree demonstrated by XRD and Raman. Further electrochemical measurements revealed that the PGBC electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of 222.0 F g\u22121 at 0.5 A g\u22121, and the solid-state symmetric supercapacitor in an aqueous electrolyte (KOH/PVA) presented considerable synergetic energy\u2013power output properties with an energy density of 6.68 W h kg\u22121 at a power density of 100.2 W kg\u22121, and 3.33 W h kg\u22121 at 10 kW kg\u22121. Moreover, the coin-type symmetric supercapacitor in an ionic liquid electrolyte (EMIM TFSI) delivered a higher energy density of 20.6 W h kg\u22121 at a power density of 12 kW kg\u22121. This approach holds great promise to achieve low-cost, green and industrial-grade production of renewable biomass-derived carbon materials for advanced energy storage applications in the future.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Carbon materials have attracted great attention for their diversified applications in supercapacitors, and different structures of carbon have been reported to exhibit dissimilar electrochemical properties. In the past, activated carbons, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon nanofibers and graphene have been shown to have excellent electrochemical performances, but it still remains a problem on how to improve the capacitance of carbon-based materials effectively from the viewpoint of their giant commercial potential. Noticing that connecting chemical groups to carbon can provide large pseudo-capacitance, we hereby demonstrated that the position of the chemical groups also plays an important role in the pseudo-capacitance. In our work, we synthesized graphene nanoribbon (GNR), graphene oxide (GO) and functional MWCNTs and showed that GNR has larger capacitance (calculated to be 202\u00a0F/g at a scan rate of 5\u00a0mV/s) and energy density compared to CNTs and GO when using as electrode materials. Furthermore, the supercapacitor device based on as-synthesized GNR exhibits excellent cycle stability and rate capability which evident is potential in high performance supercapacitor. Revealing the source of the capacitance, we found that though GNR has less oxygen-containing groups, it has larger pseudo-capacitance than GO and CNTs due to the remarkable edge-riched structure with high activity in electrochemical reactions. This finding highlights the importance of edge structure in carbon-based pseudo supercapacitor and suggests a new insight for the development of pseudo-capacitance electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "An efficient strategy for micro-structural design of microwave absorber with thin layer thickness, broad bandwidth, and strong absorption intensity remains a great challenge. Herein, hydrogenated black TiO2 (B-TiO2) nanoparticles (NPs) wrapped by amorphous carbon (B-TiO2/C) composites were successfully synthesized via using one-step hydrogenation-carbonization method for the first time. The composite structure and performance of B-TiO2/C composites can be adjusted by altering the carbonization time simply. Complex permittivity performances of B-TiO2/C under different carbonization time were investigated to optimize the composite structure that can distinctly enhance electromagnetic (EM) wave absorption property. The minimum reflection loss (RL) vale of \u221273.2 dB in \u201croe\u201d-like B-TiO2/C was obtained with a thin thickness of 1.5 mm. Adjusting the layer thicknesses from 1.0 to 5.0 mm, the optimized absorption bandwidth (RL \u2264\u221220 dB) of the \u201croe\u201d-like B-TiO2/C composites can gained, which was 10.5 GHz range from 2.7 GHz to 11.8 GHz and 15.3 to 16.7 GHz. The superior microwave absorbing property of the composites originates from the improvement of the impedance matching with the coating of amorphous carbon, and increased multiple relaxation processes in these composites. It is believed that this study opens up a fire-new way for designing novel EM wave absorbing materials.",

        "abstract": "In the face of unmet basic needs, low SES adults are less likely to obtain needed preventive health services. The study objective was to understand how these hardships may cluster and how the effectiveness of different health-focused interventions might vary across vulnerable population sub-groups with different basic needs profiles. From June 2010-2012, a random sample of low-income adult callers to Missouri 2-1-1 completed a cancer risk assessment and received up to 3 health referrals for needed services (mammography, pap testing, colonoscopy, HPV vaccination, smoking cessation and smoke-free home policies). Participants received either a verbal referral only (N=365), verbal referral+tailored print reminder (N=372), or verbal referral+navigator (N=353). Participants reported their unmet basic needs at baseline and contacts with health referrals at 1-month post-intervention. We examined latent classes of unmet basic needs using SAS. Logistic regression examined the association between latent classes and contacting a health referral, by intervention condition. A 3 class solution best fit the data. For participants with relatively more unmet needs (C2) and those with money needs (C3), the navigator intervention was more effective than the tailored or verbal referral only conditions in leading to health referrals contacts. For participants with fewer unmet basic needs (C1), the tailored intervention was as effective as the navigator intervention. The distribution and nature of unmet basic needs in this sample of low-income adults was heterogeneous, and those with the greatest needs benefitted most from a more intensive navigator intervention in helping them seek needed preventive health services.",

        "abstract": "Smoking in the United States follows a clear socioeconomic gradient: low-income Americans smoke more and quit less than those with more education and income. Evidence-based interventions like tobacco quitlines are designed to make effective cessation services available on a population basis to all smokers. However, these interventions do not address many of the unique challenges faced by low-income smokers, including unmet basic needs like food, housing, personal safety and money for necessities that often supersede health needs. Research is needed to maximize the use and effectiveness of tobacco quitlines in low-income populations. This paper details the rationale, design and methods for a 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 randomized controlled trial currently underway comparing the effects of Standard and Specialized Tobacco Quitlines with and without Basic Needs Navigation on intervention engagement and smoking cessation among low-income smokers. Smokers are recruited from United Way 2-1-1 in Missouri and all participants receive tobacco quitline services from Optum. Quitline and navigation services are provided for 3\u202fmonths. Participants complete telephone surveys at baseline, 3- and 6-month follow up. The primary study outcome is self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6-month follow up. Embedding the study in practice agencies will accelerate dissemination and scalability should our findings demonstrate intervention effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "An effective and simple method was established for the separation and enrichment of steroidal saponins from Trillium tschonoskii Maxim. The adsorption and desorption properties of seven macroporous resins were investigated. Among the tested resins, AB-8 resin showed the best adsorption and desorption capacities. The adsorption of steroidal saponins on AB-8 at 25\u00b0C was quite consistent with both the Freundlich isotherm model and the pseudo-second-order kinetics model. By optimizing the dynamic adsorption and desorption parameters, the content of steroidal saponins increased from 5.20% in the crude extracts to 51.93% in the final product, with a recovery yield of 86.67%. Furthermore, by scale-up separation, the concentration and recovery of total steroidal saponins were 43.8 and 85.5%, respectively, which suggested that AB-8 resin had great industrial and pharmaceutical potential because of its high efficiency and cost-effectiveness. In addition, a high-performance liquid chromatography method for the simultaneous determination of eight steroidal saponins was established for the first time, which was employed to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the final product. Based on the methodological validation results, the high-performance liquid chromatography method can be widely applied to the quality control of steroidal saponins from Trillium tschonoskii Maxim due to its excellent accuracy, stability, and repeatability.",

        "abstract": "In this study, surface molecularly imprinted polymers were prepared as the selective sorbents for separation of aristolochic acid I in herbal medicine extracts by a facile approach. A less toxic dummy template, ofloxacin, was used to create specific molecule recognition sites for aristolochic acid I in the synthesized polymers. The polymers were characterized by Fourier-transfer infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, elemental analysis, and nitrogen adsorption-desorption test. The adsorption capacity was calculated using adsorption kinetics, selectivity, and recycling experiments. The obtained polymers exhibited high thermostability, fast equilibrium time, and excellent binding ability. Subsequently, the polymers applied as the solid-phase extraction absorbent was proposed and used for the enrichment and analysis of aristolochic acid I in herbal plants. The result showed that the aristolochic acid I was enriched up to 16 times after analysis by using high-performance liquid chromatography. The good linearity for aristolochic acid I was obtained in the range of 0.1-200\u00a0\u03bcg/mL (R \u00a0=\u00a00.9987). The recovery and precision values were obtained (64.94-77.73%, RSDs%\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.8%, n\u00a0=\u00a03) at three spiked concentration levels. This work provided a promising method for selective enrichment, extraction, and purification of aristolochic acid I from complex herbal plants.",

        "abstract": "Dexamethasone-imprinted polymers were fabricated by reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization on the surface of magnetic nanoparticles under mild polymerization conditions, which exhibited a narrow polydispersity and high selectivity for dexamethasone extraction. The dexamethasone-imprinted polymers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive spectrometry and vibrating sample magnetometry. The adsorption performance was evaluated by static, kinetic adsorption and selectivity tests. The results confirmed the successful construction of an imprinted polymer layer on the surface of the magnetic nanoparticles, which benefits the characteristics of high adsorption capacity, fast mass transfer, specific molecular recognition and simple magnetic separation. Combined with high-performance liquid chromatography, molecularly imprinted polymers as magnetic extraction sorbents were used for the rapid and selective extraction and determination of dexamethasone in skincare cosmetic samples, with the accuracies of the spiked samples ranging from 93.8 to 97.6%. The relative standard deviations were less than 2.7%. The limit of detection and limit of quantification were 0.05 and 0.20 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. The developed method was simple, fast and highly selective and could be a promising method for dexamethasone monitoring in cosmetic products. This article is protected by copyright.

        "abstract": "Bromelain, a cysteine endopeptidase enzyme of great commercial value, has been widely used in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. Conventional methods for purification of bromelain are still limited by a low binding efficiency, time-consuming process, and expensive equipment. Therefore, for selective absorption of bromelain, we developed a facile and effective method to fabricate magnetic mesoporous molecularly imprinted polymers using pericarpium granati-derived carbon as the carrier for the first time. The characterizations of the imprinted polymers indicated that a polydopamine layer was coated on the surface of the carrier and the crystallinity of the carrier did not change. The obtained imprinted polymers exhibited favourable saturation magnetization, a high adsorption capacity of 135.96\u202fmg\u202fg, a fast equilibrium time, and satisfactory reusability. The imprinted polymers were prepared by an eco-friendly method and exhibited rapid separation and good adsorption performance, thus making the method applicable to biomacromolecular separation, proteomic analysis, and biomedical research.",

Counterfeiting has become a serious and underreported problem in the pharmaceutical industry. There are a large number of counterfeit medicines flooded in anti-diabetic markets which effect human health directly and indirectly. Therefore, some novel analytical techniques are necessary to be established for detecting these counterfeit drugs. In this study, a novel skeleton type molecularly imprinted column was successfully prepared. Based on the column, a simple, fast and reliable two-dimensional chromatography analytical system was established for selective determination of the illegal sulfonylurea additive in traditional Chinese patent medicines and functional foods. The developed method was validated. The linearitiesof the method were tested with calibration curves using ten calibration points in the concentration range of 0.25-12.5\u03bcg/g. The LODs were 0.0125\u03bcg/g and 0.01\u03bcg/g for tolbutamide and glibenclamide respectively. The five batches of Chinese patent medicines and dietary supplements obtained from different markets and online websites were tested by the validated method. With good retention time and spectral confirmation, chemical anti-diabetic substances were identified and quantified in traditional Chinese medicine and in dietary supplements.",

        "abstract": "Downregulation of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is implicated in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Berberine, a principal isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from Berberis species, has been reported to exhibit therapeutic potential in IBD. In this study, we used a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis rat model to evaluate the effect of berberine on P-gp and explore its mechanism of action. Berberine treatment improved DSS-induced colitis symptoms, attenuated inflammatory markers (myeloperoxidase, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and interleukin-1\u03b2 and -6), and enhanced P-gp expression in a dose-dependent manner. Although colonic expression of the P-gp-related nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor and transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were downregulated in the colitis model, gene and protein expression analysis revealed that berberine treatment only reversed the downregulation of Nrf2. In vitro studies using Caco-2 cells showed that the multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) gene and P-gp protein were upregulated by berberine in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Significant upregulation of the MDR1 gene by berberine was abrogated by Nrf2 silencing, indicating that the Nrf2-mediated pathway was responsible for this activation. Luciferase assays using Caco-2 cells showed a dose-dependent increase in Nrf2 reporter gene activity following berberine treatment, with a significant twofold elevation at 2.5 \u03bcM berberine, suggesting that berberine is a strong Nrf2 activator. These results suggest the possible involvement of Nrf2-mediated upregulation of P-gp in the therapeutic effect of berberine on colitis and highlight the potential of P-gp and/or Nrf2 as new therapeutic targets for IBD.",

        "abstract": "In this work, a series of facile and efficient molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) for the selective recognition and separation of lysozyme were synthesized by combining self-polymerization and nanosized matrix. The imprinted materials containing recognition sites for the lysozyme were formed via using both carboxyl-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs-COOH) as a support and dopamine (DA) with excellent biocompatibility as a functional monomer. The obtained polymers were characterized and evaluated by using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FETEM), nitrogen physisorption experiments, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The optimum reaction conditions and adsorption performance of the resultant nanomaterials were also investigated. MIPs synthesized by this method exhibited excellent imprinting factor (4.1) and high binding capacity (418 mg g\u22121) for lysozyme. After six adsorption\u2013desorption cycles, the adsorption capacity of the MIPs was only reduced by 7.4%. In addition, the prepared MIPs were used to separate and condense lysozyme from chicken egg white successfully, which showed potential values in industrial protein purification, basic biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.",

        "abstract": "Benzylpenicilloyl/albumin conjugates (BP\u2013HSA) which have lost all antibacterial activity but possess an immunogenic potential were systematically studied by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The results showed that the conjugation rate was in the range of 8\u2006:\u20061\u201318\u2006:\u20061. The interaction between human serum albumin (HSA) and penicilloic acid (BPA) was firstly studied by using molecular docking. The results showed that at least 8 activity sites existed on HSA for the conjugation of BPA. BP\u2013HSA was imprinted onto a macroporous chitosan/polyvinylpyrrolidone/carbon nanotubes carrier by using surface precipitation polymerization, and a pre-designed hybrid imprinted membrane (CPC-MIM) was obtained to achieve the specific capturing of BP\u2013HSA from human plasma. The morphologies and physical/chemical properties of membranes were systematically characterized by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, Fourier translation infrared spectra, differential scanning calorimeter, thermogravimetric analysis and contact angle measurement. The results indicated that CPC-MIM possessed superior properties for the selective adsorption of BP\u2013HSA and it also had a relatively good thermal stability. The adsorption properties of CPC-MIM were evaluated by comparing with other different constituents of membranes. The results revealed that the maximum adsorptive capacity and imprint factor of CPC-MIM were 0.538 \u03bcmol cm\u22123 and 3.3, respectively. Compared with other proteins, CPC-MIM showed a specific adsorption capacity for BP\u2013HSA, and CPC-MIM could selectively capture BP\u2013HSA from human plasma. This study provides a basis for the further research of the allergic mechanism of penicillins, and the generated hybrid imprinted membrane could potentially be an outstanding separation material for the large-scale continuous selective separation of target proteins from a complex matrix.",

In aqueous media, the adsorption properties of MIPs including adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherms and selectivity adsorption were investigated. The characterization of imprinted polymers indicated that the prepared MIPs had good stability and many cavity structures. The results of adsorption experiments illustrated the MIPs had high adsorption capacity of glycyrrhizic acid (69.3 mg g(-1)) with the imprinting factor 3.77, and it took ~5 min to get adsorption equilibrium. The MIPs could be used as an solid phase extraction sorbent absorbent for enrichment and purification of glycyrrhizic acid from the crude extraction of licorice roots, and the results showed promising practical value.",

Coamorphous loratadine-citric acid systems were prepared by solvent evaporation technique and characterized by differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray powder diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Solid-state analysis proofed that coamorphous loratadine-citric acid system (1:1) was amorphous and homogeneous, had a higher T  over amorphous loratadine, and the intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions between loratadine and citric acid exist. The solubility and dissolution of coamorphous loratadine-citric acid system (1:1) were found to be significantly greater than those of crystalline and amorphous form. The pharmacokinetic study in rats proved that coamorphous loratadine-citric acid system (1:1) could significantly improve absorption and bioavailability of loratadine. Coamorphous loratadine-citric acid system (1:1) showed excellently physical stability over a period of 3\u00a0months at 25\u00b0C under 0% RH and 25\u00b0C under 60% RH conditions. The improved stability of coamorphous loratadine-citric acid system (1:1) could be related to an elevated T  over amorphous form and the intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions between loratadine and citric acid. These studies demonstrate that the developed coamorphous loratadine-citric acid system might be a promising oral formulation for improving solubility and bioavailability of loratadine.",

        "abstract": "Aristolochic acid I is a nephrotoxic compound widely existing in many kinds of traditional Chinese medicines, especially in Aristolochiaceae medicinal plants. In this study, chitosan modified carbon microcoils were designed and prepared for the selective separation of aristolochic acid I from medicinal herbs. Successful modification of carbon microcoils was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transfer infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analyses. The effects of adsorption conditions were investigated and it was determined that the adsorption of aristolochic acid I was controlled by pH. Adsorption isotherms, kinetics, and selectivity tests were performed to evaluate the adsorption capacity and selectivity of the modified carbon microcoils. The chitosan modified carbon microcoils exhibited excellent binding ability (77.72\u202fmg\u202fg) and satisfactory selectivity. Finally, this material was used in solid phase extraction combined with HPLC to enrich and detect aristolochic acid I from medicinal plants. The detector response for aristolochic acid I was linear from 0.5 to 150\u202fmg\u202fL, and the recoveries of aristolochic acid I ranged from 73.61 to 77.73% with the relative standard deviations of less than 5%. Thus, chitosan modified carbon microcoils were ideal adsorbents for the selective extraction of aristolochic acid I from Aristolochiaceae plants.",

        "abstract": "In this work, a new form of loratadine (Form B) was prepared from a 20% methanol and 80% water mixture and characterized by polarizing microscopy (POM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The dissolution, solubility and interfacial energy of Form B in water were measured and compared with those of amorphous and Form A loratadine. In addition, the solid-state transformations of loratadine solid forms were investigated by hot-stage microscopy (HSM) and DSC while the non-isothermal crystallization of amorphous loratadine was studied by DSC. It was found that Form B has a unique acicular structure and PXRD pattern, which are different from Form A. Moreover, Form B has a higher equilibrium solubility compared with Form A. The results of the solid-state transformation investigation (DSC) shows that the amorphous form was changed to the new polymorph B at 106.7 \u00b0C and Form B converted exothermally to Form A at 93.9 \u00b0C during heating. In the non-isothermal crystallization of amorphous loratadine, the crystallization rate constant (Zt) increased with the increasing heating rate and the Avrami exponent (n) was found to be about 3. Hopefully, Form B will be considered to be a promising approach to improve the loratadine solubility/dissolution rate.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, four amorphous samples of loratadine were prepared by quench-cooling the melted drug at different temperatures. With these samples, the crystallization tendencies were tested by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and non-isothermal cold crystallization kinetics was investigated by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the molecular dynamics both in super-cooled liquid and in glassy states was analyzed by using broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) at a temperature range from 213 to 393 K. From the PXRD results, it was established that the four amorphous loratadine samples were apt to crystallize at a temperature below the glass transition temperature. From the DSC results, it was found that the non-isothermal crystallization mechanism of these four loratadine forms was similar. However, the fast crystallization tendency (low physical stability) was also observed for the amorphous loratadine which was obtained at a low quench-cooling temperature. The tendency was analyzed based on the BDS results which demonstrated that rapid molecular mobility could generate a low physical stability and was closely related to Johari\u2013Goldstein relaxation. These results suggested that loratadine had a weak frustration against crystallization and its physical stability was affected by the quench-cooling temperature. This study laid a foundation for choosing the right technique to prepare the amorphous form of loratadine and improving its physical stability.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Functionalized magnetic carbonaceous nanomaterials, which are important materials with many practical and research applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical and biological fields, have recently attracted much attention. In this study, a magnetic mesoporous carbon coated with \u03b2-cyclodextrin (MMC@\u03b2-CD) was synthesized for the first time from natural  pericarpium granati  (PG). The as-obtained MMC@\u03b2-CD has high surface areas (203\u00a0m 2 \u00a0g \u2212\u00a01 ), large pore volumes (0.16\u00a0cm 3 \u00a0g \u2212\u00a01 ), relatively broad mesoporous sizes (6.8\u00a0nm) and a high saturation magnetization of 26.2\u00a0emu\u00a0g \u2212\u00a01 , which is sufficient for magnetic separation by an external magnetic field. The MMC@\u03b2-CD was used as an innovative adsorbent for magnetic solid-phase extraction of lopid via host\u2013guest interaction prior to spectrofluorometric analysis. The proposed method was successfully applied to analyze lopid in human serum and pharmaceutical wastewater samples with recoveries in the range of 85.0\u2013103.5% for the spiked samples. Overall, this work not only provides an inexpensive and eco-friendly method to fabricate MMC@\u03b2-CD (or MMC) from PG, but also develops a highly selective approach for capture of lopid in biological samples and environmental substances.",

        "abstract": "Carbon-based nanomaterials have recently attracted tremendous attention in adsorption, separation and biological fields. However, such modification is not always straightforward when the surface is not chemically reactive. Given this reason, most carbon materials modification processes employ reactive linkers or coupling agents, which are complicated and time-consuming. Herein, we report on a dopamine-polyethyleneimine (PEI) coating strategy to fabricate micrometer-sized magnetic carbon fiber (MSMCF)-based extracorporeal blood-cleansing sorbent for hemoperfusion. Results showed that the dopamine/PEI-coated MSMCF had a twisted fiber shape with a size range of 80-120\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter and porous structure with a specific surface area of 146\u00a0m\u00a0g. Adsorption behavior of dopamine/PEI-modified MSMCF was examined by using bilirubin as a toxin model compound. Equilibrium data were well fitted to the Langmuir isotherm model with a maximal adsorption capacity of 335.1\u00a0mg\u00a0g at ambient temperature. The as-obtained material had relatively high bilirubin adsorption selectivity against albumin at a normal albumin concentration. In particular, the dopamine/PEI-coated MSMCF has excellent adsorption capacity and hemocompatibility compared to the MSMCF decorated only by dopamine or PEI. Therefore, this work may pave the way for enhancing the property of the extracorporeal blood-cleansing sorbent during hemoperfusion.",

        "abstract": "To handle oil spillage and chemical leakage accidents, the development of novel sorbent materials is of global significance for environment and water source protection. In this work, a magnetically carbonaceous fiber (MCF) aerogel was for the first time fabricated by a facile approach from natural cotton as a precursor, and this material can be used as a potential adsorbent without any further chemical modification for oil\u2013water separation under demanding conditions. Owing to its unique and superior properties, such as twisted fiber structure, light weight, high porosity, desirable hydrophobicity, excellent separation efficiency, and strong thermal/mechanical stability, the MCF aerogel exhibits a high adsorption capacity for organic solvents and oils (22\u201387 times its own weight) and good recyclability. Coupled with the simple, low-cost, and environment-friendly synthesis process, the MCF aerogel will be a promising candidate for removing organic pollutants in environmental pollution cleanup. Hopefully, the MCF aerogel and the corresponding fabrication approach will be further applied to extensive applications including energy storage, fabrication of multifunctional composite materials, and so on.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Carbon coils have many significant technological applications; however, most of them were fabricated using either expensive apparatus or complicated procedures. Herein, a versatile and simple method was used for fabricating valuable single-helix carbon microcoils (SHCMs) by Fe(III)-osmotically induced shape transformation of zucchini ( Cucurbita pepo  L.). This versatile strategy allowed to readily reach high surface area (365\u00a0m 2 \u00a0g \u22121 ), large pore volume (0.24\u00a0cm 3 \u00a0g \u22121 ) and a narrow average mesoporous size of 5.5\u00a0nm via a combined impregnation and hydrothermal carbonization process, and to achieve uniform SHCMs in a reasonable system. In addition, the SHCMs showed excellent performance in antibacterial property and the clearance of chloramphenicol, which should be a promising candidate for efficient adsorbent in water purification. The equilibrium data were well fitted to the Langmuir isotherm model with a maximal adsorption capacity of 124.32\u00a0mg\u00a0g \u22121  at ambient temperature. The antibacterial mechanisms was also explored. The findings revealed that the Fe(III)-osmotically induced transformation is a potential route for large-scale preparation of SHCMs from appropriate biomass precursors.",

        "abstract": "The extensive use of nanomaterials in commercial products will lead to environmental contamination, which may cause serious health issues in the future. To date, limited scavengers have been available for the capture of these emerging nanopollutants from water. The aim of this work was to synthesize hybrid ternary co-polymer membrane-coated micrometer-sized carbon fiber aerogels (MCFAs) to remove emerging nanopollutants from water and to investigate the mechanisms involved. The MCFAs were fabricated by direct pyrolysis of cotton in an inert atmosphere. Post-modification with chitosan (CS) and dopamine\u2013polyethylenimine (PEI) complex generated amine-coated MCFAs with porous textures, followed by protonation using diluted acid solution. The surface functional groups and morphologies of the ternary CS and dopamine\u2013PEI co-coated MCFAs were systematically characterized. The as-obtained hybrid composite was successfully used for the removal of citrate-capped gold and silver nanoparticles from water. The equilibrium data were well fitted to the Langmuir isotherm model, with maximal adsorption capacities of 31.2 mg g\u22121 (Au NPs) and 41.8 mg g\u22121 (Ag NPs) at ambient temperature. The highest adsorption capacities reached 30.2 mg g\u22121 (Au NPs) and 34.9 mg g\u22121 (Ag NPs) at the equilibrium concentrations; these were very close to the maximum adsorption capacities of the monolayers. In addition, the adsorption of both nanoparticles on the as-prepared composite followed the pseudo-second-order kinetics model. Therefore, this work may pave the way for enhancing the properties of MCFAs for removal of nanopollutants from medical and/or industrial wastewaters.",

The risk factor of patient experience is increasingly recognized as a critical component in improving patient experience. Our study explored risk factors of negative patient experience in order to improve the health-service quality of public hospitals. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Hubei province, China. A total of 583 respondents were surveyed by the Outpatient Experience Questionnaire with good validity and reliability in July 2015. T-tests were conducted to compare the experience scores among different outpatient groups. Multiple linear regression was performed to determine the significant factors that influenced the outpatient experience. Outpatients between 18 and 44 years old had the lowest experience scores (65.89 \u00b1 0.79), whereas outpatients completely paying out-of-pocket had the lowest experience scores (64.68 \u00b1 0.81) among all participants. Outpatients with poor self-rated health status had the lowest experience scores (66.14 \u00b1 1.61) among different self-rated health status groups. While age, type of payment, and self-rated health status were significantly risk factors that influenced outpatient experience in the multiple linear regression. Thus, health-care providers should pay more attention to outpatients who are young (age <45), completely out-of-pocket and poor health status, and provide precision health care to improve outpatient experience.",

        "abstract": "Background  A major unmet need in SLE is identifying a biomarker that consistently tracks with disease activity. One approach is measuring complement activation by evaluating consumption of serum C3 and C4. However, since they are acute phase reactants (1), interpretation of these levels is challenging as serum levels may not decrease until late in a disease flare (2). iC3b is a proteolytically derived molecule of C3b, and increases with complement activation. iC3b/C3 ratio measures complement consumption relative to production, which may provide for a more accurate assessment of complement activation.  Objectives  We hypothesize that blood iC3b and iC3b/C3 levels will provide a more specific and reliable marker of complement activation and disease activity in SLE.  Methods  137 adult SLE patients were enrolled in this prospective observational study. The number of patient visits varied from 1 to 7 times during the study period, encompassing 376 visits. C3 and C4 were measured by nephelometry; iC3b using an investigational lateral flow assay test (Kypha, Inc, St. Louis, MO). SLE disease activity was measured using the SLEDAI 2K Responder Index-50 (S2K RI-50) instrument. Patients with active disease are considered to have a S2K RI-50 score u003e4. Clinically meaningful improvement is defined as a decrease in S2K RI-50 score \u22654 from prior visit, while clinically meaningful worsening is defined as an increase in S2K RI-50 score \u22654 from prior visit. Multilevel regression models were performed to examine associations with disease activity. Ordinal logistic regression models with the generalized estimating equation modeling (GEE) were used to examine associations for clinically meaningful changes since the outcome variable is ordinal (i.e. clinical deterioration, stability, and improvement). Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for iC3b, C3, C4, ESR, CRP, dsDNA values, prednisone usage, and race were estimated using Proc GLIMMIX and Proc GENMOD (SAS v9.4).  Results  Blood levels of iC3b, C3, iC3b/C3 ratio, C4, dsDNA, ESR, and prednisone use each correlated with SLE disease activity. Multilevel multiple logistic regression analysis revealed only iC3b/C3 ratio, dsDNA levels, and prednisone use were significant predictors of disease activity (Table 1). To determine whether iC3b/C3 ratio can predict clinically meaningful changes in SLE disease activity, we evaluated the interpatient association between clinical deterioration, stability, and improvement and iC3b/C3 ratios. Multiple ordinal logistic regression with GEE showed that iC3b/C3 ratio, dsDNA levels, and prednisone use significantly predicted both clinically meaningful improvement and deterioration in disease activity.  Conclusions  In this prospective study, blood iC3b/C3 ratios were predictive of active SLE disease. Furthermore, iC3b/C3 ratio was predictive of clinical meaningful changes in disease activity. These data warrant further investigation of iC3b/C3 ratio as a potential biomarker for disease activity in SLE.  References  Gabay u0026 Kushner, N Engl J Med. 1999;340(6):448\u2013454.

        "abstract": "This study aimed to determine whether hospital competition is associated with improved in-hospital mortality in Shanxi, China. We included a total of 46,959 hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and 44,063 hospitalizations for pneumonia from 2015 to 2017. Hospital competition was measured as Herfindahl\u207bHirschman Index based on the patient predicted flow approach. Two-level random-intercept logistic models were applied to explore the effects of hospital competition on quality for both AMI and pneumonia diagnoses. Hospital competition exerts negative or negligible effects on inpatient quality of care, and the pattern of competition effects on quality varies by specific diseases. While hospital competition is insignificantly correlated with lower AMI in-hospital mortality (odds ratio (OR): 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.77\u207b1.11), high hospital competition was, in fact, associated with higher in-hospital mortality for pneumonia patients (OR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.51\u207b2.64). Our study suggests that simply encouraging hospital competition may not provide effective channels to improve inpatient quality of health care in China's current health care system.",

        "abstract": "While there has been an escalating trend in the number of smokeless tobacco uses, mainly snuff, in the United States, it is unclear whether smokeless tobacco users are a homogenous class. The present investigation examines this question and identifies subtypes of smokeless tobacco users in order to better understand the characteristics of these individuals and guide appropriate intervention. Data on smokeless tobacco users (N\u00a0=\u00a02504) derived from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions was employed. A range of antisocial behaviors, from reflecting non-violent deviant acts, irresponsibility, and a disengaged lifestyle, to aggression and violence were used to estimate the number of subtypes of smokeless tobacco users using latent class analysis. Four latent classes emerged: Normative Class (50.2\u00a0%), Deviant Class (21.9\u00a0%), Disengaging Class (17.2\u00a0%), and Antisocial Class (10.5\u00a0%). Logistic regression shows that major depression, alcohol use disorder, and marijuana use disorder were associated with Deviant Class (OR's from 2.0 to 10.5). The same array of psychiatric disorders and general anxiety disorder were associated with greater odds of membership in the Disengaging Class (OR's from 2.6 to 7.4). Aforementioned psychiatric disorders and illicit drug use disorder were associated with the Antisocial Class (OR's from 3.8 to 38.1). Findings indicate that smokeless tobacco users are a heterogeneous population that may benefit from differential intervention strategies. ",

        "abstract": "The mucosal surfaces constitute the first immune barrier of host defense and also serve as the dynamic interfaces that simultaneously mediate a diverse array of critical physiological processes. It has been long hypothesized that observed difference of disease resistance among different fish strains and species are strongly correlated to the activities of the immune actors in mucosal surfaces. Particularly, neuronal NOS (nNOS or NOS1) is a constitutively expressed gene that catalyzes the oxidation of l-arginine and water to nitric oxide (NO), which is known as a potent host defence effector in immune system with antimicrobial activity. Moreover, NOS1 was detected to be expressed in fish mucosal surfaces, but its activities in mucosal immune responses were always overlooked. In this regard, we identified the NOS1 of turbot and characterized its expression patterns in mucosal tissues following Vibrio anguillarum and Streptococcus iniae challenge. The results showed that the NOS1 gene had a 4389 bp open reading frame (ORF) that encoded 1462 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis showed the turbot NOS1 had the strongest relationship to Larimichthys crocea. And the syntenic analysis revealed the similar neighboring genes associated with turbot NOS1, compared with other teleost and mammals. In addition, NOS1 was widely expressed in all examined tissues with the highest expression level in brain, followed by intestine and gill. Finally, the NOS1 showed a general trend of up-regulation in mucosal tissues following both bacterial challenge, with the highest up-regulation in intestine. The significant quick induction of NOS1 in mucosal surfaces against infection indicated its key roles to prevent pathogen attachment and entry in mucosal immunity. More functional studies are needed to conduct in teleost to better understand the roles of NOS1 in maintaining the integrity of the mucosal barriers against infection.",

In this regard, we identified the CTSF gene of turbot as well as its protein structure, phylogenetic relationships, and expression patterns in mucosal tissues following Vibrio anguillarum and Streptococcus iniae challenge. We also determined the expression patterns of CTSF in mucosal tissues after vaccinated with the formalin-inactivated V.\u00a0vulnificus whole-cell vaccine. Briefly, turbot CTSF gene showed the closest relationship with that of Paralichthys olivaceus in phylogenetic analysis. And CTSF was ubiquitously expressed in all tested tissues with the highest expression level in gill.

The significant quick regulation of CTSF in mucosal surfaces against infection indicated its roles in mucosal immunity.

        "abstract": "TLRs (Toll-like receptors) are very important pathogen pattern recognition receptors, which control the host immune responses against pathogens through recognition of molecular patterns specific to microorganisms. In this regard, investigation of the turbot TLRs could help to understand the immune responses for pathogen recognition. Here, transcripts of two TLR5 (TLR5a and TLR5b) were captured, and their protein structures were also predicted. Meanwhile, we characterized their expression patterns with emphasis on mucosal barriers following different bacterial infection. The phylogenetic analysis revealed the turbot TLR5 genes showed the closest relationship to Paralichthys olivaceus. These two TLR5 genes were ubiquitously expressed in healthy tissues although expression levels varied among the tested tissues. In addition, the two copies of turbot TLR5 showed different expression patterns after bacterial infections. After Vibrio anguillarum infection, TLR5a was generally up-regulated in intestine and skin while down-regulated in gill, while TLR5b showed a general down-regulation in mucosal tissues. After Streptococcus iniae infection, the TLR5a was down-regulated at 2\u00a0h while generally up-regulated after 4\u00a0h in mucosal tissues. Interestingly, the TLR5b was up-regulated in intestine while down-regulated in skin and gill after Streptococcus iniae infection. These findings suggested a possible irreplaceable role of TLR5 in the immune responses to the infections of a broad range of pathogens that include Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Future studies should apply the bacteriological and immune-histochemical techniques to study the main sites on the mucosal tissue for bacteria entry and identify the ligand specificity of the turbot TLRs after challenge.",

        "abstract": "Rhamnose-binding lectin (RBL) were mostly identified from egg cortex and ovary cells from vertebrates and invertebrates, with the specific binding activities to l-rhamnose or d-galactose. Previously, we found that a RBL gene was dramatically down-regulated (-11.90 fold at 1\u202fh, -48.95 fold at 4\u202fh, -905.94 fold at 12\u202fh) in the intestine of turbot following Vibrio anguillarum challenge using RNA-seq expression analysis. In this regard, we sought here to identify RBLs in turbot, as well as the analysis of genomic structure, phylogenetic relationships, basal tissue distribution and the expression patterns following different bacteria challenge in mucosal tissues. In this study, two RBLs were captured in turbot with two conserved type 5 CRD5s, which were belong to type IIIc RBL. In phylogenetic tree analysis, turbot RBLs were clustered with tilapia, European sea bass and snakehead. In addition, in comparison of genomic architecture of turbot RBLs with the available published RBL genes revealed a high degree of conservation in the exon/intron organization among the teleost species. Moreover, both RBLs were significantly up-regulated in mucosal tissues following V. anguillarum and Streptococcus iniae challenge, indicated their critical roles in turbot mucosal immunity. Further studies are needed to expand functional characterization of detailed mechanisms of RBLs in fish innate immunity.",

It participates in the host immune defense via phagocytosis, signal transduction, cell-cell communication, proliferation, and migration of immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. In this study, we reported the identification of SmCTSZ, a CTSZ homolog from turbot (Scophthalmus maximus L.). SmCTSZ was 317 residues in length and contains a Pept-C1 domain. In multiple species comparison, SmCTSZ shared 65-93% overall sequence identities with the CTSZ counterparts from human, rat, and several fish species. In the phylogenetic analysis, SmCTSZ showed the closest relationship to Cynoglossus semilaevis. The syntenic analysis revealed the similar neighboring genes of CTSZ across all the selected species, which suggested the synteny encompassing CTSZ region during vertebrate evolution. Subsequently, SmCTSZ was constitutively expressed in various tissues, with the lowest and highest levels in brain and intestine respectively. In addition, SmCTSZ was significantly up-regulated in intestine following both Gram-negative bacteria Vibrio anguillarum, and Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus iniae immersion challenge. Finally, the rSmCTSZ showed strong binding ability to all the examined microbial ligands, and the agglutination effect to different bacteria.

        "abstract": "Abstract   The mucosal immune system serves as the frontline barriers of host defense against pathogen infection, especially for the fishes, which are living in the pathogen rich aquatic environment. The intestine constitutes the largest surface body area in constantly contact with the external pathogens, and plays a vital role in the immune defense against inflammation and pathogen infection. Previous studies have revealed that fish intestine might serves as the portal of entry for  Vibrio anguillarum . To characterize the immune actors and their associated immune activities in turbot intestine barrier during bacterial infection, here we examined the gene expression profiles of turbot intestine at three time points following experimental infection with  V.\u00a0anguillarum  utilizing RNA-seq technology. A total of 122 million reads were assembled into 183,101 contigs with an average length of 1151 bp and the N50 size of 2302 bp. Analysis of differential gene expression between control and infected samples at 1\u00a0h, 4\u00a0h, and 12\u00a0h revealed 2079 significantly expressed genes. Enrichment and pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes showed the centrality of the pathogen attachment and recognition, antioxidant/apoptosis, mucus barrier modification and immune activation/inflammation in the pathogen entry and host immune responses. The present study reported the novel gene expression patterns in turbot mucosal immunity, which were overlooked in previous studies. Our results can help to understand the mechanisms of turbot host defense, and may also provide foundation to identify the biomarkers for future selection of disease-resistant broodstock and evaluation of disease prevention and treatment options.",

Galectin-4 is a member of tendem-repeat galectins, plays vital roles in intestinal epithelial barrier. Here, one galectin-4 gene was captured in turbot (SmLgals4) contains a 1197 bp open reading frame (ORF). In comparison to other species, SmLgals4 showed the highest similarity and identity both to large yellow croaker. The genomic structure analysis showed that SmLgals4 had conserved exons in the CRD domains compared to other vertebrate species. The syntenic analysis revealed that galectin-4 had the same neighboring genes across all the selected species, which suggested the synteny encompassing galectin-4 region during vertebrate evolution. Subsequently, SmLgals4 was widely expressed in all the examined tissues, with the highest expression level in intestine and the lowest expression level in skin. In addition, SmLgals4 was significantly down-regulated in intestine following both Gram-negative bacteria Vibrio anguillarum, and Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus iniae immersion challenge. Finally, the rSmLgals4 showed strong binding ability to all the examined microbial ligands. Taken together, our results suggested SmLgals4 plays vital roles in fish intestinal immune responses against infection, but the detailed roles of galectin-4 in teleost are still lacking, further studies are needed to be carried out to characterize whether galectin-4 plays similar roles in teleost intestinal immunity.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small non-coding RNAs, which could bind to the 3'-untranslated regions of their target mRNAs to regulate gene expression in various biological processes, including immune-regulated signaling pathways. Turbot (Scophthalmus maximus L.), an important commercial fish species in China, has been suffering with Vibrio anguillarum infection resulted in dramatic economic loss. Therefore, we investigated the expression profiles of miRNAs, as well as the immune-related miRNA-mRNA pairs in turbot intestine at 1\u00a0h, 4\u00a0h, and 12\u00a0h following V. anguillarum infection. As a result, 266 predicted novel miRNAs and 283 conserved miRNAs belonging to 92 miRNA families were detected. A total of 44 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the intestine following V. anguillarum infection. Following prediction, the potential target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were grouped into a wide range of functional categories, including immune defense/evasion, inflammatory responses, RIG-I signaling pathway, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Moreover, we selected 15 differentially expressed immune genes and their related differentially expressed miRNAs to construct an interaction network for V. anguillarum infection in turbot. These results suggested that in teleost, as in higher vertebrates, miRNAs prominently contribute to immune responses, protecting the host against infection. In addition, this is the first report of comprehensive identification of turbot miRNAs being differentially regulated in the intestine related to V. anguillarum infection. Our results provided an opportunity for further understanding of the molecular mechanisms of miRNA regulation in turbot host-pathogen interactions.",

        "abstract": "Innate immune system is the primary defense mechanism against pathogen infection in teleost, which are living in pathogen-rich aquatic environment. It has been long hypothesized that the disease resistance in teleost are strongly correlated to the activities of innate immune genes. Tilapia is an important economical fish around the world, especially in China, where the production accounts for nearly half of the global production. Recently, S.\u00a0agalactiae has become one of the most serious bacterial diseases in southern China, resulted in high cumulative mortality and economic loss to tilapia industry. Therefore, we sought here to characterize the expression profiles of tilapia against S.\u00a0agalactiae infection at whole transcriptome level by RNA-seq technology. A total of 2822 genes were revealed significantly expressed in tilapia spleen with a general trend of induction. Notably, most of the genes were rapidly the most induced at the early timepoint. The significantly changed genes highlighted the function of pathogen attachment and recognition, antioxidant/apoptosis, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and immune activation. Collectively, the induced expression patterns suggested the strong ability of tilapia to rapidly recognize the invasive bacteria, and activation of downstream immune signaling pathways to clear the bacteria and prevent the tissue damage and bacteria triggered cell apoptosis. Our results heighted important roles of novel candidate genes which were often missed in previous tilapia studies. Further studies are needed to characterize the molecular relationships between key immune genes and disease resistance, and to identify the candidate genes for molecular-assistant selection of disease-resistant broodstock and evaluation of disease prevention and treatment measures.",

In this regard, we sought here to identify Cathepsin A in turbot (SmCTSA), characterize its mucosal expression patterns following Vibrio anguillarum and Streptococcus iniae infections in mucosal tissues, and explore its binding ability with three microbial ligands for the first time. The SmCTSA was 2631 bp long containing a 1422 bp open reading frame (ORF) that encoded 473 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SmCTSA showed the closest relationship to half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis). In addition, SmCTSA was ubiquitously expressed in all examined healthy tissues, with high expression levels in head kidney (HK) and intestine, while the lowest expression level in blood. Moreover, SmCTSA was significantly differentially expressed at at least two timepoints in each mucosal tissue, suggesting its potential important roles in innate immune responses of turbot. Finally, in vitro assays showed that recombinant SmCTSA bound Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with high affinity, and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and peptidoglycan (PGN) with relatively low affinity. This study provides valuable data for understanding the roles of ctsa in the host defense against bacterial infections.",

In the phylogenetic analysis, SmCD36 showed the closest relationship to C. semilaevis, followed by Takifugu rubripes. The genomic structure analysis showed that CD36 had 12 exons with almost the same length in vertebrate species, indicating the conservation of CD36 during evolution. The syntenic analysis revealed that CD36 located between GNAI1 and SEMA3C genes across all the selected species, which suggested the synteny encompassing CD36 region during vertebrate evolution. Subsequently, SmCD36 was expressed in all the examined turbot tissues, with the highest expression level in intestine. In addition, SmCD36 was significantly up-regulated in intestine following both Gram-negative bacteria Vibrio anguillarum, and Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus iniae immersion challenge. Finally, the rSmCD36 showed strong binding ability to all the examined microbial ligands and significant inhibition effect on Staphylococcus aureusrequires. Taken together, our results suggested SmCD36 involved in fish innate immune responses to bacterial infection. However, the knowledge of CD36 are still limited in teleost species, further studies should be carried out to better characterize its detailed roles in teleost mucosal immunity.",

        "abstract": "The mucosal surfaces constitute the first line of host defense against infection, and also serve as the dynamic interfaces that simultaneously mediate a diverse array of critical physiological processes, while in constantly contact with a wide range of pathogens. The lysozymes are considered as key components for innate immune response to pathogen infection with their strong antibacterial activities. But their activities in mucosal immune responses were always overlooked, especially for g-type lysozymes, whose expression patterns in mucosal tissues following bacterial challenge are still limited. Towards to this end, here, we characterized the g-type lysozymes, Lyg1 and Lyg2 in turbot, and determined their expression patterns in mucosal barriers following different bacterial infection. The phylogenetic analysis revealed the turbot g-type lysozyme genes showed the closest relationship to Cynoglossus semilaevis. The two lysozyme genes showed different expression patterns following challenge. Lyg2 was significantly up-regulated in mucosal tissues following Vibrio anguillarum and Streptococcus iniae challenge, while Lyg1 showed a general trend of down-regulation. The significant mucosal expression signatures of g-type lysozyme genes indicated their key roles to prevent pathogen attachment and entry in the first line of host defense system. Further functional studies should be carried out to better characterize the availability of utilization of g-type lysozyme to increase the disease resistance in the mucosal surfaces and facilitate the disease resistant breeding selection.

        "abstract": "Desiccation tolerance has been long considered as an important trait for the life survival under acute environmental stress. One of the biggest problems for modern commercial crab farming is desiccation during transportation; high mortality could occur following the aerial exposure. In this regard, here, we utilized RNA-seq-based transcriptome profiling to characterize the molecular responses of swimming crab in response to aerial exposure. In present study, following aerial exposure, the gill samples were sequenced at 0, 6, 12, and 18\u00a0h. And the sequenced reads were assembled into 274,594 contigs, with average length of 735.59\u00a0bp and N50 size of 1262\u00a0bp. After differential expression analysis, a total of 1572 genes were captured significantly differentially expressed, and were categorized into antioxidant/oxidative stress response, chaperones/heat shock proteins, immune alteration, cell proliferation/apoptosis, and cytoskeletal. Our analysis revealed the dramatic tissue oxidant stress and the alteration of the tissue epithelial integrity, especially many genes that have not been reported in crab species. With the limited functional information in crab, further studies are needed and underway in our lab to further characterize the key cellular actors governing the crab tolerance to aerial exposure. Taken together, our results provide molecular resources for further identification of key genes for desiccation tolerance, and to facilitate the molecular selection and breeding of desiccation tolerant strain and family.",

        "abstract": "Activation of cannabinoid receptor type 2 has been shown to have anti-fibrosis function in skin and heart. However, whether activating cannabinoid receptor type 2 inhibits pulmonary fibrosis remains elusive. Lung fibroblasts and TGF-\u03b21 are key players in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. In this research, we aimed to investigate the role of cannabinoid receptor type 2 in pulmonary fibrosis  and . In lung fibroblasts stimulated by TGF-\u03b21, preincubated by cannabinoid receptor type 2 agonist JWH133 not only reduced the elevated levels of collagen I and \u03b1-SMA, but also inhibited fibroblasts' proliferation and migration. The dosage of JWH133 had no clear cytotoxic activity, and all these JWH133 effects were partially abrogated by cannabinoid receptor type 2 antagonist SR144528. In bleomycin-induced mice pulmonary fibrosis model, CT images of the lung tissue revealed an extensive ground-glass opacity, reticular pattern and fibrosis stranding. Notably, JWH133 treatment controlled the ongoing fibrotic process (showed by decreased lung density and fibrosis score). Meanwhile, lung histological results revealed that JWH133 treatment suppressed both the inflammatory response and extracellular collagen deposition. SR144528 may increase the pulmonary fibrosis, but no statistically significant difference was proved. Importantly, JWH133 reduced serum profibrotic cytokines levels of TGF-\u03b21 and inhibited TGF-\u03b21/Smad2 pathway  and . Our research indicated that activating cannabinoid receptor type 2 by a pharmacological method might be a potential strategy for pulmonary fibrosis.",

        "abstract": "To characterize the distinctive chest high-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) features and clinical manifestations of primary Sj\u00f6gren syndrome (pSS)-related interstitial lung disease (ILD). The demographic data, clinical manifestations, and laboratory and radiological findings of 527 pSS patients were retrospectively analyzed. ILD was defined based on the presences of pulmonary signs in HRCT. Two hundred six of 527 patients were diagnosed as pSS-ILD, and the prevalence was 39.1%. The three most frequent abnormalities in HRCT were reticular pattern (92.7%), ground-glass attenuation (87.4%), and bronchovascular bundle thickening (82%). One hundred twenty-four cases (60.2%) of the pSS-ILD patients had only a single HRCT pattern, which involved 86 non-specific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP) cases (41.7%), 22 usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) cases (10.68%), 8 organizing pneumonia (OP) cases (3.9%), and 8 lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) cases (3.9%), respectively. Besides, the more important observation was that 82 cases had no less than two HRCT patterns, and NSIP admixed with OP (43.9%), NSIP admixed with UIP (35.4%), and NSIP admixed with LIP (19.5%) were the most frequent. HRCT of pSS-ILD patients demonstrated bilateral infiltrates (99%), with abnormalities predominantly in the lower lobes (89.3%) and subpleural areas (81.1%), and a few lesions were characterized by hilum distributed (8.7%). Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) revealed impaired diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and total lung capacity, and the rate of small airway lesions in the pSS-ILD patients was 3.5 times higher in patients of pSS. Logistic regression analysis showed that dry cough (OR 59.05), clubbing (OR 6.26), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (OR 21.38) and positive anti-Ro (OR 7.86) were relevant factors of pSS-ILD. ILD is the common pulmonary involvement of pSS and the prevalence of pSS-ILD is 39.1%. The single pattern of NSIP and UIP in HRCT are the commonest, and about 40% of the pSS-ILD patients possess multiple patterns in HRCT. The classification of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis cannot completely include the pulmonary imaging features of pSS-ILD.",

Our previous studies revealed a novel association between LOXL2 expression and pulmonary fibrosis in mice. However, the exact role and mechanisms of LOXL2 in interstitial lung disease remain poorly understood. The present study aimed to detect LOXL2 expression in mice with bleomycin (BLM)\u2011induced pulmonary fibrosis, and explore the effects of silencing LOXL2 on the proliferation, activation and fibrosis process of mouse lung fibroblasts\u00a0(MLFs). In addition, the present study investigated the association between LOXL2 and the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u2011\u03b2)/Smad signaling pathway to identify the mechanism underlying the role of LOXL2 in fibrosis progression. An animal model of pulmonary fibrosis was established by administering an intratracheal injection of 5\u00a0mg/kg BLM to C57BL/6 mice. ELISA and immunohistochemical examination were used to detect the LOXL2 level in the serum, lung homogenate and pulmonary tissues in mice. Pulmonary tissues of mice were extracted to culture primary MLFs, and a LOXL2 small interfering RNA adenovirus vector was established to silence LOXL2 in MLFs. Cell proliferation was detected using the cell counting kit\u20118 assay. Reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used to measure the expression of LOXL2, TGF\u2011\u03b21, Smad2/3, phosphorylated\u00a0(p)Smad2/3, Smad4, and Smad7 and Snail in cells. Interleukin\u20116\u00a0(IL\u20116) and type\u00a01 collagen\u00a0\u03b11 (COL1A1) in the supernatant of cells were analyzed by ELISA. It was demonstrated that LOXL2 expression was significantly increased in serum, lung homogenate and pulmonary tissues of mice with BLM\u2011induced pulmonary fibrosis compared with control mice. Furthermore, silencing LOXL2 significantly decreased MLF proliferation, and the levels of IL\u20116 and COL1A1 in the supernatant of cells. Furthermore, silencing LOXL2 inhibited the expression of pSmad2/3, Smad4 and Snail, while it promoted Smad7 expression. The present data provides a comprehensive analysis of the LOXL2 in pulmonary fibrosis and indicates prominent roles for LOXL2 in fibrogenesis via regulation of the TGF\u2011\u03b2/Smad signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been considered as the ideal tool for the evaluation of atherosclerotic plaques. Circulating trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), which is a metabolite of the dietary lipid phosphatidylcholine, has recently been linked to elevated coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. The objective of the study was to investigate the relation between circulating TMAO level and coronary plaque vulnerability assessed by OCT in patients with CAD. A total of 26 patients with CAD were recruited to assess coronary plaque using OCT and measure plasma TMAO level. According to plaque rupture status, patients were divided into plaque rupture group (n\u00a0= 12) and nonplaque rupture group (n\u00a0= 14). Plasma TMAO level was significantly higher in patients with plaque rupture than in those with nonplaque rupture (8.6 \u00b1 4.8\u00a0\u03bcmol/L vs 4.2 \u00b1 2.4\u00a0\u03bcmol/L, p\u00a0=\u00a00.011). Moreover, positive correlations between plasma TMAO level and lipid arc (r\u00a0=\u00a00.43, p\u00a0= 0.031), lipid volume index (r\u00a0= 0.39, p\u00a0= 0.048) were also observed. In conclusion, circulating TMAO level may reflect coronary plaque vulnerability and progression.",

        "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high resolution imaging modality and has been considered as the ideal tool for the evaluation of neointimal tissue and vascular responses following stent implantation. However, vascular response profiles following the implantation of a novel nano polymer-free sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) assessed by OCT has not been fully investigated. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the effects of a nano polymer-free SES on neointimal formation using OCT. A total of 16 nano polymer-free SESs were implanted in the coronary arteries of 8 pigs. At 3 (n=4) or 6 months (n=4), the animals were euthanized following OCT evaluation and the stented arterial segments were analyzed by histological analysis. Neointimal area, thickness and burden were evaluated by OCT. In addition, strut-associated inflammation, stent endothelialization and arterial injury were investigated by histomorphological analysis. OCT examination showed that at 6 months, neointimal thickness (193.3\u00b1109.5 vs. 167.2\u00b1119.7 \u00b5m, P=0.023) and neointimal burden (29.3\u00b114.3 vs. 24.8\u00b117.4%, P=0.006) significantly increased compared with at 3 months. Histomorphological analysis indicated that the endothelialization score was significantly greater at 6 months compared with at 3 months (2.85\u00b10.36 vs. 2.52\u00b10.60, P<0.001). However, at 3 months, nano polymer-free SES showed a significantly higher inflammatory score [0 (0, 1) vs. 0 (0, 0), P<0.001] compared with at 6 months. In conclusion, nano polymer-free SES achieves endothelialization at 3 months; however, neointimal proliferation is more significant at 6 months and may be attributed to strut-associated inflammation.",

        "abstract": "Paradoxical embolization is the mechanism for patent foramen ovale (PFO)-associated cryptogenic stroke and transcatheter closure of PFO may prevent recurrent ischemic stroke. Mechanical thrombectomy is promising to treat acute ischemic stroke due to high rates of reperfusion and reduced intracranial hemorrhage complications. We report the case of a 27-year-old woman with a massive cerebral infarction but no evidence for any atherosclerosis, who received an urgent mechanical thrombectomy with a Solitaire device. In order to ascertain the etiology of stroke, transcranial Doppler (TCD) and transesophageal echocardiograph (TEE) were conducted. TCD showed severe right-to-left shunting (shower effect) after Valsalva maneuver and bubble test and TEE identified a PFO. Therefore, the patient had suffered a paradoxical stroke associated with PFO. After two weeks of the stroke onset, transcatheter PFO closure with Cardio-O-Fix occluder was also performed successfully. During 1-year of follow-up, no recurrence of stroke occurred. Our case demonstrates that mechanical thrombectomy using a Solitaire device and transcatheter PFO closure can be safely and successfully performed to treat acute paradoxical stroke and prevent its recurrence.",

Herein, we demonstrate a scalable, single-step electrochemical exfoliation of graphite into highly solution-processable fluorine-modified graphene (FG), achieved in an aqueous fluorine-containing neutral electrolyte, for flexible and high-energy-density ionogel-based micro-supercapacitors (FG-MSCs). The electrochemically exfoliated FG nanosheets are characterized by atomic thinness, large lateral size (up to 12 \uf06dm), a high yield of >70% with \u22643 layers, and a fluorine doping of 3 at%, allowing for large-scale production of FG-MSCs. Our ionogel-based FG-MSCs deliver high energy density of 59 mWh cm-3, by far outperforming the most reported MSCs. Furthermore, the all-solid-state microdevices offer exceptional cyclability with ~93% after 5000 cycles, robust mechanical flexibility with 100% of capacitance retention bended at 180\u00b0, and outstanding serial and parallel integration without the requirement of metal-based interconnects for high-voltage and high-capacitance output. Therefore, these FG-MSCs represent remarkable potential for electronics.",

        "abstract": "Graphene and other two-dimensional materials (2DMs) have attracted intensive interest for use in energy storage and conversion systems because of their unique structure and remarkable properties. Although significant progress has been made in this field, certain intrinsic limitations obstruct the achievement of desired properties. 2D heterostructures, upon stacking or stitching different 2DMs in well-defined sequences or patterns, could significantly entail drastic changes in their properties, and thereby synergistically combine the merits of individual 2DMs while eliminating their related drawbacks. Herein, we provide a topical review of recent advances in the preparation and characterization of 2D heterostructures for energy-related applications. Firstly, an introduction is given to the definition and importance of 2D heterostructures, followed by their typical categories of vertically stacked heterostructures and horizontal in-plane heterostructures reported so far. Secondly, the state-of-the-art synthesis approaches to fabricate 2D heterostructures, including mechanically aligned transfer, chemical vapor deposition, liquid exfoliation and self-assembly, and layer by layer self-assembly, are introduced in detail. Then, the current status of advanced characterization techniques like scanning probe-, electron-diffraction-, X-ray-, and spectroscopy-based techniques that are critical for the accurate identification of 2D heterostructures and understanding of the performance-enhancing mechanisms of devices is systemically summarized. Furthermore, recent applications of 2D heterostructures in energy storage (e.g., lithium/sodium ion batteries, lithium sulfur batteries, supercapacitors, and micro-supercapacitors) and conversion (e.g., hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions and photocatalysis) are exemplified to highlight their positive synergistic effect. Finally, future challenges and prospective solutions that may direct the growth of 2D heterostructures and their energy-related applications are proposed.",

Here we have demonstrated that epitaxial graphene overlayers can be obtained by annealing a nickel carbide covered Ni(111) surface using in situ surface imaging techniques. Epitaxial graphene islands nucleate and grow via segregation of dissolved carbon atoms to the top surface at about 400\u00a0\u00b0C. This is in contrast to a mixture of epitaxial and non-epitaxial graphene domains grown directly on Ni(111) at 540\u00a0\u00b0C. The different growth behaviors are related to the nucleation dynamics which is controlled by local carbon densities in the near surface region.",

Electrochemical results reveal that the PtRu@h-BN/C catalysts show similar activity in hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) as the PtRu/C catalysts but present enhanced CO-tolerance in fuel cell tests. Single cell performance with the PtRu@h-BN/C catalyst has been lowered by less than 20% with 30\u202fppm CO/25% CO 2  introduced into H 2  feed gas, while the PtRu/C catalyst suffers from a decrease of 60% under the same conditions. The reaction data and characterization results suggest that h-BN ultrathin shells can achieve a good balance between durability and activity, enabling the PtRu@h-BN/C material to act as a potential anode catalyst for PEMFCs.",

In the present work, the structural changes of h-BN overlayers on Pt(111) in oxidative atmospheres including O2 and NO2 have been investigated by using low energy electron microscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and near ambient pressure XPS. We find that h-BN islands can be intercalated by oxygen in 10-6 Torr O2 at 200 \u00b0C, while oxygen intercalation of full layer h-BN around 200 \u00b0C requires near ambient pressure O2 (0.1 Torr) or such a strong oxidant as NO2 (10-6 Torr). h-BN overlayers can be etched away in the gases at much high temperatures, e.g. 800 \u00b0C. Upon mild oxidation in O2 or NO2 at temperatures of 400-450 \u00b0C, h-BN is transformed to boron oxide (BOx) overlayers, which can be converted back to h-BN by heating in NH3 at 800 \u00b0C.",

        "abstract": "Graphene layers are often exposed to gaseous environments in their synthesis and application processes, and interactions of graphene surfaces with molecules particularly H2 and O2 are of great importance in their physico-chemical properties. In this work, etching of graphene overlayers on Pt(111) in H2 and O2 atmospheres were investigated by in-situ low energy electron microscopy. Significant graphene etching was observed in 10-5 Torr H2 above 1023 K, which occurs simultaneously at graphene island edges and interiors with a determined reaction barrier at 5.7 eV. The similar etching phenomena were found in 10-7 Torr O2 above 973 K, while only island edges were reacted between 823 and 923 K. We suggest that etching of graphene edges is facilitated by Pt-aided hydrogenation or oxidation of edge carbon atoms while intercalation-etching is attributed to etching at the interiors at high temperatures. The different findings with etching in O2 and H2 depend on competitive adsorption, desorption, and diffusion processes of O and H atoms on Pt surface, as well as intercalation at the graphene/Pt interface.",

KGaA, Weinheim Topological insulators (TIs) are quantum materials with topologically protected surface states surrounding an insulating bulk. However, defect-induced bulk conduction often dominates transport properties in most TI materials, obscuring the Dirac surface states. In order to realize intrinsic topological insulating properties, it is thus of great significance to identify the spatial distribution of defects, understand their formation mechanism, and finally control or eliminate their influence. Here, the electronic heterogeneity in polyol-synthesized Bi2Se3and chemical vapor deposition-grown Sb2Te3nanocrystals is systematically investigated by multimodal atomic-to-mesoscale resolution imaging. In particular, by combining the Drude response sensitivity of infrared scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy with the work-function specificity of mirror electron microscopy, characteristic mesoscopic patterns are identified, which are related to carrier concentration modulation originating from the formation of defects during the crystal growth process. This correlative imaging and modeling approach thus provides the desired guidance for optimization of growth parameters, crucial for preparing TI nanomaterials to display their intrinsic exotic Dirac properties.",

Here, we observe an abnormal \u201ccompact-to-fractal\u201d morphological transition with increasing growth temperature for hexagonal boron nitride growth on the Ru(0001) surface. The unusual growth process can be explained by a reaction-limited aggregation (RLA) mechanism. Moreover, introduction of the subsurface Ar atoms has enhanced this RLA growth behavior by decreasing both reaction and diffusion barriers. Our work may shed light on the epitaxial growth of two-dimensional atomic crystals and help to control their morphology.",

In this work, we present CO intercalation under a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) overlayer on Ru(0001) at room temperature, observed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy. Critical factors influencing the interfacial process have been investigated, including CO partial pressure, h-BN coverage, and oxygen pre-adsorption on the Ru surface. It has been identified that CO adsorption on the bare Ru surface region plays an important role in CO intercalation. Comparative studies of CO intercalation at h-BN/Ru(0001) and graphene/Ru(0001) interfaces indicate that CO starts to intercalate h-BN overlayers more easily than graphene. Temperature-programmed CO desorption experiments from h-BN/CO/Ru(0001) and graphene/CO/Ru(0001) surfaces reveal a similar confinement effect of the 2D cover on CO adsorption, which results in a more abrupt and quick CO desorption in comparison with the CO/Ru(0001) surface.

The observed CO superstructures on Pt(111) in different CO atmospheres allow to derive surface coverages of CO adlayers, which are higher in the confined nanospace between h-BN and Pt(111) than those on the open Pt surface under the same conditions. Dynamic NAP-STM imaging data together with theoretical calculations confirm confinement-induced molecule enrichment effect within the 2D nanospace, which reveals new chemistry aroused by the confined nanoreactor.",

The stabilization of these nanostructures during reactions remains a major challenge. Here, we show that metastable two-dimensional (2D) FeO structures can be grown on Pt(111) and Au(111), but not on the graphene surface. The well-defined 2D structure is achieved by an interface confinement effect originating from the strong interfacial bonding between Fe atoms and substrate surface atoms. The stabilization effect has been described by the interface confinement energy (Econfinement), which is the energy difference lowered by interfacing the 2D structure with a substrate and decreases in the sequence of Pt(111) u003e Au(111) u003e graphene. This interface effect is widely present in many metal\u2013oxide composite catalysts and can be used to guide the rational design of catalytically active sites.",

        "abstract": "The interface between metal and reducible oxide has attracted increasing interest in catalysis. The FeOx\u2013Pt interface has been a typical example, which showed remarkable activity for the preferential oxidation of CO (PROX) at low temperatures. However, model catalytic studies under vacuum conditions or in high-pressure O-rich environment at 450 K have reported two different active phases with iron in two different valence states, invoking a possible pressure gap. To identify the active phase for low-temperature CO oxidation and PROX, it is necessary to investigate the stability and activity of FeO/Pt(111) under the realistic reaction conditions. We thus conducted an in situ study on FeO/Pt(111) from ultrahigh vacuum to the atmospheric pressure of reactant gases. Our study shows FeO islands were easily oxidized in 1 Torr O2 to form the trilayer FeO2 islands. However, the presence of 2 Torr CO could prevent the oxidation of FeO islands and lead to CO oxidation at the FeO/Pt(111) interface. The FeO/Pt(111) s...",

The stability of ultrathin Cu films against oxidation has been of particular interest, but there is a lack of microscopic understanding. We report here an atomic-level study on the thickness-dependent oxidation kinetics of Cu layers on Au(111), from ultrahigh vacuum to near ambient conditions. Ultrathin Cu films on Au(111) were found to exhibit a superior oxidation resistance over Cu(111), and their oxidation resistances increase in the order of Cu(111) u003c 2.4 ML Cu u003c 0.4 ML Cu. For 0.4 ML Cu, the spontaneous subsurface diffusion of Cu at 300 K and the formation of a Au-rich surface alloy inhibit the formation of copper oxides at the O2 pressure below 10\u20134 mbar. However, at near ambient conditions, 0.4 ML Cu would be partially oxidized to the CuO phase directly. In contrast, multilayer Cu or bulk Cu(111), tho...",

The reactivity of the w-ZnO(0001) surface toward CO and H2 was found to be more prominent than those on the surfaces of g-ZnO/Au(111). CO oxidation took place primarily at the edge sites of w-ZnO(0001) and the interface between g-ZnO NSs and Au(111), while g-ZnO thin films on Au(111) appeared to be inert below 600 K. Similarly, the w-ZnO(0001) surface could dissociate H2 at 300 K, accompanied by a substantial surface reconstruction, while g-ZnO on Au(111) appeared inert for H2 activation at 300 K.

        "abstract": "Nickel carbide and graphene overlayers were grown on Ni(111), which were in situ monitored by near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) and low energy electron microscopy. CO adsorption and desorption on the formed carbon-modified Ni(111) surfaces were further investigated by NAP-XPS. We found that the carbidic carbon weakens CO adsorption on Ni, resulting in quick CO desorption around room temperature. A full graphene layer on Ni(111) blocks CO adsorption in 10\u20136 Torr CO, while CO intercalates the graphene overlayers in 0.1 Torr CO at room temperature. On the graphene/CO/Ni(111) surface, the major part of intercalated CO molecules desorbs extensively around 90 \u00b0C from the graphene/Ni interface and the remaining part gets trapped under the graphene even at 200 \u00b0C. These results suggest that the surface reactivity of a metal catalyst can be strongly modulated by surface carbon structures.",

Understanding the fundamentals of confined catalysis has become an important topic in heterogeneous catalysis. Well-defined 2D space between a catalyst surface and a 2D material overlayer provides an ideal microenvironment to explore the confined catalysis experimentally and theoretically. Using density functional theory calculations, we reveal that adsorption of atoms and molecules on a Pt(111) surface always has been weakened under monolayer graphene, which is attributed to the geometric constraint and confinement field in the 2D space between the graphene overlayer and the Pt(111) surface. A similar result has been found on Pt(110) and Pt(100) surfaces covered with graphene. The microenvironment created by coating a catalyst surface with 2D material overlayer can be used to modulate surface reactivity, which has been illustrated by optimizing oxygen reduction reaction activity on Pt(111) covered by various 2D materials. We demonstrate a concept of confined catalysis under 2D cover based on a weak van der Waals interaction between 2D material overlayers and underlying catalyst surfaces.",

In this work, we present a route toward formation of 2D heterostructures via confined growth of a 2D adlayer underneath the other 2D overlayer. Taking a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) monolayer on Ni(111) as a model system, both epitaxial and nonepitaxial h-BN islands have been identified on the Ni surface. Surface science studies combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that the nonepitaxial h-BN islands interact weakly with the Ni(111) surface, which creates a 2D nanospace underneath the h-BN islands. An additional h-BN or graphene layer can be grown in the space between the nonepitaxial h-BN islands and Ni(111) surface, forming h-BN/h-BN bilayer structures and h-BN/graphene heterostructures. These results suggest that confined growth under 2D covers may provide an effective route to obtain stacks of 2D atomic crystals.",

We present a process that reaches C 2  = \u2013C 4  =  selectivity as high as 80% and C 2 \u2013C 4  94% at carbon monoxide (CO) conversion of 17%. This is enabled by a bifunctional catalyst affording two types of active sites with complementary properties. The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrO  x  ) activates CO and H 2 , and C\u2212C coupling is subsequently manipulated within the confined acidic pores of zeolites. No obvious deactivation is observed within 110 hours. Furthermore, this composite catalyst and the process may allow use of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H 2 /CO ratio.",

Here, we suggest an alternative way toward this modulation by placing a two-dimensional (2D) cover on the metal surface. As an illustration, CO adsorption on Pt(111) surface has been studied under 2D hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) overlayer. Dynamic imaging data from surface electron microscopy and in situ surface spectroscopic results under near ambient pressure conditions confirm that CO molecules readily intercalate monolayer h-BN sheets on Pt(111) in CO atmosphere but desorb from the h-BN/Pt(111) interface even around room temperature in ultrahigh vacuum. The interaction of CO with Pt has been strongly weakened due to the confinement effect of the h-BN cover, and consequently, CO oxidation at the h-BN/Pt(111) interface was enhanced thanks to the alleviated CO poisoning effect.",

        "abstract": "Strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) has been regarded as one of the most important concepts in heterogeneous catalysis, which has been almost exclusively discussed in metal/oxide catalysts. Here, we show that gold/molybdenum carbide (Au/MoCx) catalysts are featured by highly dispersed Au overlayers, strong interfacial charge transfer between metal and support, and excellent activity in low temperature water-gas-shift reaction (LT-WGSR), demonstrating the active SMSI state. Subsequent oxidation treatment results in strong aggregation of Au nanoparticles, weak interfacial electronic interaction, and poor LT-WGSR activity. The two interface states can be transformed into each other by alternative carbonization and oxidation treatments. This work reveals the active SMSI effect in metal/carbide catalysts induced by carbonization, which opens a new territory for this important concept.",

        "abstract": "CO2 capture via solid adsorption technology relies on the development of low-cost and high-performance new solid adsorbents. The robust and large-scale produced hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) porous materials are an ideal candidate but present low CO2 adsorption properties. Here, we report that in situ carbon doping of BN materials (BCN) can be facilely controlled by thermal annealing of boric acid and melamine mixtures in various atmospheres. CO2 uptake of the BCN materials is in the range of 3.74\u20133.91 mmol CO2 g\u22121 (165\u2013172 mg CO2 g\u22121) at 298 K and ambient pressure, whereas it is only 1.16\u20131.66 mmol CO2 g\u22121 (53.0\u201373.1 mg CO2 g\u22121) over the pure BN materials. The separation coefficient between CO2 and N2 is up to 74 and no decrease in the adsorption performance was observed after nine adsorption/desorption cycles. The BCN material presents the best performance among known BN-based sorbents, which is comparable to many excellent carbon materials. Detailed characterization reveals that the incorporation of carbon into the BN matrix increases the density of ultramicropores (u003c0.7 nm) and chemical defects, consequently enhancing the CO2 adsorption capacity and the selectivity over N2 molecules.",

Here, we have reported novel Ni@h-BN core-shell nanocatalysts consisting of nickel nanoparticles encapsulated in few-layer h-BN shells. The Ni@h-BN catalysts exhibit an improved HOR performance compared with the bare Ni nanoparticles.  characterization experiments and density functional theory calculations indicate that the interactions of the O, H, and OH species with the Ni surface under the h-BN shell are weakened, which helps to maintain the active metallic Ni phase both in air and in the electrolyte and strengthen the HOR processes occurring at the h-BN/Ni interfaces. These results suggest a new route for designing high-performance non-noble metal electrocatalysts with encapsulating two-dimensional material overlayers for HOR reactions.",

Our recent surface science works however demonstrate that molecules such as CO can adsorb on Pt(111) surface covered by graphene overlayers via an intercalation process, and surface reactions e.g. CO oxidation have been enhanced by the graphene covers. In this work, supported Pt nanocatalysts were coated by ultrathin graphitic carbon layers through chemical vapor deposition process forming Pt@C core\u2013shell nanostructures, which were confirmed by characterizations of Raman spectroscopy, temperature-programmed oxidation and transmission electron microscopy. CO oxidation over the Pt@C catalysts shows a lower apparent activation energy compared with the pure Pt catalysts, and in-situ infrared studies indicate that the reactions occur under the graphitic shells. The present results suggest that coating metal nanocatalysts with ultrathin graphitic overlayers may be used to promote metal catalyzed reactions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have shown as unique nanoreactors to tune the catalytic activity of confined nano-catalysts. Here we report that the catalytic performance of molybdenum carbide nanoparticles (MoC  x   NPs) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process can be enhanced by encapsulation within single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with a diameter of 1\u20132\u202fnm. The catalyst with MoC  x   NPs located on the interior surface of SWNTs (MoC  x  @SWNTs) exhibits a lower onset over-potential and a smaller Tafel slope than the one with MoC  x   NPs attached on the exterior surface (MoC  x  /SWNTs). This is likely attributed to the much smaller particle size and the more reduced states of the confined MoC  x   NPs, as well as the larger specific surface area of MoC  x  @SWNTs compared with MoC  x  /SWNTs. In addition, the electronic structure of the confined MoC  x   NPs might be modified by the confinement effects of SWNTs, and hence the adsorption free energy of H atoms on the confined MoC  x   NPs, which could also contribute to their higher performance. These results suggest that the SWNTs can be further explored for constructing novel catalysts with beneficial catalytic performance.",

LNCM in the proposed sodium-ion battery demonstrates good rate capability whose discharge capacity reaches about 90\u2005mA\u2009h\u2009g(-1) at 10\u2005C rate and excellent cycle stability with specific capacity of about 105\u2005mA\u2009h\u2009g(-1) for 200 cycles at 5\u2005C rate. Moreover, ex situ ICP-OES suggests interesting mixed-ions migration processes: In the initial two cycles, only Li(+) can intercalate into the LNCM cathode, whereas both Li(+) and Na(+) work together as the electrochemical cycles increase. Also the structural evolution of LNCM is examined in terms of ex situ XRD pattern at the end of various charge-discharge scans. The strong insight obtained from this study could be beneficial to the design of new layered cathode materials for future rechargeable sodium-ion batteries. ",

The material showed a specific capacity of 268.6 mAh g in the voltage window of 0.01-3.0 V vs Na/Na. Due to the fast diffusion of Na in the NASICON framework, the material exhibited superior rate capability with a specific capacity of 94.4 mAh g at a current density of 5A g. Additionally, 99.1% capacity retention was achieved after 300 cycles, demonstrating excellent cycle stability. By comparison, MgTi(PO) delivered 629.2 mAh g in 0.01-3.0 V vs Li/Li, much higher than that of the sodium-ion cells. During the first discharge, the material decomposed to Ti/Mg nanoparticles, which were encapsulated in an amorphous SEI and LiPO matrix. Li ions were stored in the LiPO matrix and the SEI film formed/decomposed in subsequent cycles, contributing to the large Li capacity of MgTi(PO). However, the lithium-ion cells exhibited inferior rate capability and cycle stability compared to the sodium-ion cells due to the sluggish electrochemical kinetics of the electrode.",

        "abstract": "Tavorite LiFeSO4F has been regarded as a promising alternative to LiFePO4 due to its high Li ionic conductivity. To overcome the low electronic conductivity of LiFeSO4F, we prepared a graphene oxide (GO)/LiFeSO4F composite material by the solvothermal method. The GO wraps on the surface of LiFeSO4F and links the adjacent particles, thus providing an effective network for electrons transport. As a result, the electronic conductivity of the material is improved from 8.16 \u00d7 10\u201311 S cm\u20131 to 1.65 \u00d7 10\u20134 S cm\u20131. In addition, the GO depresses the side reactions of the electrode and electrolyte, promotes the charge transfer reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface, and facilitates the lithium diffusion in the electrode. The GO-wrapped LiFeSO4F exhibits much better electrochemical performance than the pristine material. It showed a discharge capacity of 113.2 mAh g\u20131 at the 0.1 C rate with 99% capacity retention after 100 cycles. In addition, the material is able to deliver 85.1, 73.4, and 30.3 mAh g\u20131 at ...",

Moreover, traditional sodium ion batteries suffer from serious safety problems resulting from the sodium dendrites formed on the anode. In order to circumvent these problems, we designed a highly reversible Na+/Mg2+ hybrid-ion battery composed of a metallic Mg anode, a TiS2 derived titanium sulfide cathode and a 1.0 M NaBH4 + 0.1 M Mg(BH4)2/diglyme hybrid electrolyte. The battery showed remarkable electrochemical performances with a large discharge capacity (200 mA h g\u22121 at the 1C rate), high rate capability (75 mA h g\u22121 at the 20C rate) and long cycle life (90% capacity retention after 3000 cycles). Moreover, it exhibited excellent safety properties due to dendrite-free Mg deposition of the anode and the high thermal stability of the cathode. These merits demonstrate the great potential of the reported Na+/Mg2+ hybrid-ion battery for large-scale energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Cobalt sulfides based on conversion mechanisms are considered as promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries due to their appropriate working voltage and high practical capacities. But the severe volume change and structure transformation make their cycle stability and rate capability unsatisfactory. In this study, metal-organic framework derived Co 9 S 8 @carbon yolk-shell nanocages (Co 9 S 8 @CYSNs) was prepared and its direct conversion mechanism was carefully demonstrated for the first time by various spectroscopic techniques and first-principles calculations. The unique hierarchical structure of Co 9 S 8 @CYSNs composed of Co 9 S 8  nanoparticles dispersed in amorphous carbon matrix inside a rigid carbon shell was capable of accelerating the conversion reaction, shortening the Na +  diffusion distance and providing a fast electron transport channel. Benefiting from the accelerated electrochemical reactions and high activities of nanosized particles, the Co 9 S 8 @CYSNs exhibited a large discharge capacity of 549.4\u202fmA\u202fh\u202fg -1  at 0.1\u202fA\u202fg -1 . In addition, a superior rate performance of 100\u202fmA\u202fh\u202fg -1  at 10\u202fA\u202fg -1  and excellent cycle stability with a very low capacity decay of 0.019% per cycle over 800 cycles at 10.0\u202fA\u202fg -1  were achieved because of the confine effect of the carbon shell and improved charge transfer reactions of the electrode.",

The TiO 2  anatase delivers high initial discharge/charge capacities of 225\u202fmAh g \u22121 /204\u202fmAhg \u22121  in a mixture of Phenylmagnesium chloride-AlCl 3 /LiCl in tetrahydrofuran (APC/LiCl) hybrid electrolyte, while the TiO 2 (B) shows high initial discharge/charge capacities of 260\u202fmAh g \u22121 /231\u202fmAh g \u22121  in the same hybrid electrolyte. Low discharge capacities of 67 and 57\u202fmAh g \u22121  and strong polarization are observed for both TiO 2  anatase and TiO 2 (B) samples in pure APC electrolyte, respectively.  In situ  synchrotron diffraction strongly identifies that in APC/LiCl hybrid electrolyte, the TiO 2  anatase undergoes structural evolution via a solid solution and a two-phase reaction mechanism, while TiO 2 (B) exhibits a solid solution reaction during the discharge-charge processes. The analysis of X-ray photoelectron spectra for the TiO 2  anatase and TiO 2 (B) cathodes in the discharged/charged states reveals a change of Mg/Ti as well as Li/Ti ratios at different stages, which may indicate a contribution of both Mg and Li to the charge storage mechanism in the hybrid electrolyte.",

        "abstract": "Tetragonal spinel ZnMn2O4 provides extremely high capacity as an anode for Li-ion batteries owing to a conversion-type mechanism. In this work, nanoparticle-composed layered ZnMn2O4 is synthesized using a co-precipitation method. Calcination parameters are optimized through thermal gravimetric analysis and in situ high temperature synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction. The ZnMn2O4 shows an initial lithiation capacity of \u223c1400 mA h g\u22121 and a high reversible capacity of \u223c900 mA h g\u22121 at a specific current of 0.5 A g\u22121. In situ synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction reveals phase evolution during the 1st cycle. An intermediate phase, tetragonal spinel LiZnMn2O4, is formed and coexists with the original ZnMn2O4 during the 1st lithiation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy applied at varying potentials during the 1st cycle provides evidence of the high Li+ diffusion coefficient and low resistance of the electrode in the lithiated state, which enables a high rate performance with 810 mA h g\u22121 at 1 A g\u22121 and 580 mA h g\u22121 at 2 A g\u22121. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the solid-electrolyte interphase is mainly composed of LiOH and Li2CO3, which can contribute additional capacity. In addition, an Mn(II)/Mn(III) redox reaction appearing during the 60th to 100th cycles is reported for the first time and could be another reason for the capacity increase upon cycling (the maximum capacity is \u223c1250 mA h g\u22121 at the 90th cycle). This redox reaction is facilitated by the increase in the electronic conductivity upon cycling. Based on these investigations, fundamental insights into the energy storage mechanism of ZnMn2O4 conversion anodes in Li-ion batteries are clarified. This work can shed light on an understanding of other conversion-type electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries are one of most promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage, due to the high abundance and low cost of sodium in the earth. However, the lack of advanced electrode materials greatly affects their applications. Here, for the first time, layered-structure SbPO4 is explored as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries in terms of SbPO4 nanorods on reduced graphene oxide (SbPO4/rGO). In-situ transmis-sion electron microscope images reveal the preferential expansion along the transverse direction of the nanorods upon the first discharging, which arises from the reduction of SbPO4 to Sb and the subsequent alloying of Sb as supported by in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns. SbPO4/rGO exhibits a capacity retention of 99% after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g-1 both in half cells and in full cells. Its specific capacity at 5 A g-1 is 214 mA h g-1 in half cells or 134 mA h g-1 in full cells. Moreover, the energy density of the full cells at 1.2 kW Kg-1total is still 99.8 W h Kg-1total, very promising as an advanced electrode material.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   As numerous efforts have been devoted to the construction of nano-structured sulfur electrodes, the rational design of multi-functional separator is attracting an increasing research enthusiasm recently as another promising approach towards high-performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, red phosphorus nanoparticles are employed, for the first time, to establish a metal-free and cost-effective multifunctional separator, which not only efficiently immobilizes the lithium polysulfides but also facilitates the ion conduction for fast and durable sulfur redox reactions. The computational and experimental results reveal that red phosphorus is capable of chemically confining the polysulfides through a combination of the Lewis acid-base interaction and sulfur-chain catenation, while the highly conductive Li 3 PO 4  is generated during the cell operation and facilitates ion transportation. Attributed to these unique features, the cells based on the as-developed separator exhibit a high sulfur utilization of 1287\u202fmAh g \u22121  at 0.1\u202fC, superb rate capability of 809\u202fmAh g \u22121  at up to 2\u202fC, and excellent cycling performance with 82% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1\u202fC. This facile and low-cost strategy not only offers an effective pathway towards enhancement in battery performance, but could also inspire new thinking on developing metal-free functional agents for improved sulfur electrochemistry.",

        "abstract": "The shuttle effect of polysulfide is the primary obstacles of Li-S batteries. Although some efforts have been made to suppress the shuttle process, more highly conductive materials with stronger adsorption ability to polysulfides are still in the urgent demand. Another important problem is the worsened performance of Li-S battery with prolonged cycling due to irreversible deposition of lithium sulfide (Li2S). However, the host material for the effective conversion of insoluble Li2S has been vacant up to now. Herein, porous nanorod molybdenum carbide (Mo2C NRs) with high catalytic activity for Li2S and ultrastrong adsorption for polysulfides, is used as the \"bi-functional\" host material and incorporated into sulfur cathodes for the first time. The \"bi-functional\" Mo2C NRs inherits an advantage of immobilizing polysulfides over the conventional host, with the adsorption energy from -4.89 eV to -8.20 eV for Li2Sx (x = 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8). The electrochemical analysis shows that Mo2C NRs, more than an anchor, can activate Li2S by greatly reducing the charging overpotential. Therefore, the irreversible deposition of polysulfides is effectively restrained and the utilization of Li2S is obviously enhanced. The Mo2C NRs-sulfur composites (Mo2C NRs-S) cathodes provide a capacity of 1298 mAh/g at 0.1 C in the Li-S batteries. More importantly, the battery with Mo2C NRs-S cathodes exhibits the much lower capacity decay of 0.062 % per cycle at 1 C over 500 cycles.",

The aim of this study was to compare clinical outcomes in terms of postoperative superficial and deep infection, malunion, delayed union, nonunion and hardware failure between these two treatment methods. So a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed. All available randomized controlled trials that compared the clinical results of EF to those of UTN were obtained and the reported numbers of citations for each observed item were extracted to perform data synthesis. Six published randomized controlled trials with a total of 407 cases fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Data analysis revealed that UTN reduced the incidence rates of superficial infection and malunion after fixation compared with EF. However, EF led to a significant reduction in hardware failure. For postoperative deep infection, delayed union and nonunion, the treatment effects were similar between these two groups. Therefore, we recommend UTN over EF for the management of open tibial fractures. However, patients' postoperative weight bearing should be controlled to avoid hardware failure.",

        "abstract": "Microglial cells are phagocytic cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and have been proposed to be a primary component of the innate immune response and maintain efficient CNS homeostasis. Microglial cells are activated during various phases of tissue repair and participate in various pathological conditions in the CNS. Following spinal cord injury (SCI), anoxemia is a key problem that results in tissue destruction. Hypoxia\u2011inducible factor 1\u2011\u03b1 (HIF\u20111\u03b1) may protect hypoxic cells from apoptosis or necrosis under ischemic and anoxic conditions. However, numerous studies have revealed that hypoxia upregulates HIF\u20111\u03b1 expression leading to the death of microglial cells. The present study investigated the alterations in HIF\u20111\u03b1 expression levels and the mechanism of autophagic cell death mediated by HIF\u20111\u03b1 in microglial cells induced by hypoxia. Hypoxia was demonstrated to induce HIF\u20111\u03b1 expression and autophagic cell death in microglial cells. Enhanced autophagy reduced cell death during the initial stages by restraining the functions of autophagy\u2011associated genes (microtubule\u2011associated protein 1A/1B\u2011light chain 3 phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate and Beclin\u20111) and modulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor\u2011\u03b1 and interleukin\u20111\u03b2). Target value was determined by Cell Counting Kit 8 and cell death by flow cytometry. Transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemical staining, reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and ELISA were used for further analysis. However, increased expression of HIF\u20111\u03b1 induced cell death and autophagic cell death in microglial cells. Furthermore, the effects of the HIF\u20111\u03b1 inhibitor 2\u2011methoxyestradiol and HIF\u20111\u03b1 small interfering RNA on the death and autophagy of microglial cells in\u00a0vitro were investigated. These investigations revealed the suppression of autophagy, the decrease of cell viability and the increase of inflammatory cytokines results from HIF\u20111\u03b1 inhibition or HIF\u20111\u03b1 silencing. In conclusion, the results indicated that appropriate expression of HIF\u20111\u03b1 can ameliorate autophagic cell death of microglial cells associated with hypoxia, and may provide a novel therapeutic approach for SCI associated with microglial cell activation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Introduction  Osteotomy and internal fixation are usually the most effective way to treat the malunion of lateral tibial plateau fractures, and the accuracy of the osteotomy is still a challenge for surgeons. This is a report of a series of prospectively study of osteotomy treatment for the malunion of lateral plateau fractures with the aid of 3D printing technology.    Methods  A total of 7 patients with malunion of lateral tibial plateau fractures were enrolled in the study between September 2012 to September 2014 and completed follow up. CT image data were used for 3D reconstruction, and individually 3D printed models were used for accurate measurements and detail osteotomy procedures planning. Under the premeditated operation plan, the osteotomy operations were performed. Patients were invited for follow-up examinations at 2 and 6 weeks and then at intervals of 6 to 8 weeks until 12 months or more.    Results  Mean age of the patients was 44 years (range 30\u201352 years), 3 cases were result of fall injuries, 2 were traffic accidents and 2 were sports injuries. Among the cases, one accompanied with craniocerebra trauma, one with pelvic fracture, one accompanied with both. According to the Schatzker Tibial Plateau classification, the original fracture type were 3 type I, 1 type II and 3 type III. The lateral tibial plateau collapse ranges from 4 mm\u201312\u00a0mm, with an average of 9.4\u00a0mm. All the operations were successfully completed, the average operation time was 77.1\u00a0min (range 70\u201390\u2009min), the average intraoperative blood loss was 121.4\u00a0ml (range 90\u2013180\u00a0ml), the mean follow-up time was 14.4 months (range 12\u201318 months), and the average healing time of the osteotomy fragments was 12 weeks (range 11\u201313 weeks). The difference between preoperative and postoperative Rasmussen scores were statistically significant (P\u00a0    Conclusion  3D printing technology is helpful to accurately design osteotomy operation, reduce the risk of postoperative deformity, decrease intraoperative blood loss, shorten the operation time, and can effectively improve the treatment effect.",

Analysis in this study indicates that when a complex pole of the open-loop MTDC subsystem is close to an electromechanical oscillation mode (EOM) of concern in the open-loop AC subsystem on the complex plane, this open-loop modal coupling may cause strong dynamic interactions between the MTDC and the AC system. It is very likely that when the open-loop modal coupling occurs, the small-signal stability of the MTDC/AC power system may considerably degrade. In this study, New England test system integrated with an MTDC for wind power transmission is used to demonstrate and validate analysis and conclusions made. Both the master-slave control and the DC voltage droop control for the MTDC are examined.

        "abstract": "This paper examines the impact of dynamic interactions between the voltage source converters (VSCs) on the small-signal stability of an AC/MTDC (multiterminal dc) power system. The examination is carried out based on a closed-loop interconnected model consisted of an open-loop VSC subsystem and an open-loop subsystem of the rest of MTDC network (RDCN). Open-loop modal coupling is the modal condition that an oscillation mode of open-loop VSC subsystem is close to an oscillation mode of open-loop subsystem of the RDCN on the complex plane. Analysis indicates that the open-loop modal coupling may very likely degrade the small-signal stability of the AC/MTDC power system. If a VSC uses the active power control, the open-loop VSC subsystem is of no oscillation mode. Hence, open-loop modal coupling between the VSCs cannot occur in the MTDC network implementing the master\u2013slave control. Whilst the open-loop modal coupling may introduce instability risk to the MTDC network using the dc voltage droop control. Therefore, the paper reveals the mechanism about how and why the dynamic interactions between the VSCs may degrade the small-signal stability of the AC/MTDC power system from the perspective of the system modal condition\u2014the open-loop modal coupling.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a method of open-loop modal analysis to examine the subsynchronous interactions (SSIs) introduced by the converter control in an ac power system integrated with a multiterminal dc network. A control loop of the voltage source converters (VSCs) is selected to derive a closed-loop interconnected model, wherein the selected control loop and the rest of the power system are modeled as two interconnected open-loop subsystems. The analysis in this paper indicates that under the condition of open-loop modal proximity, strong SSIs may be introduced by the selected VSC control loop. It is very likely that the strong SSIs may degrade the damping of power system subsynchronous oscillations (SSOs). It is proposed that the damping degradation be estimated by calculating the open-loop SSO residues. Hence, the modal analysis for the open-loop subsystems can identify the open-loop modal proximity and estimate the degree of stability degradation under the condition of open-loop modal proximity. In addition, the VSC control loops and the synchronous generators contributing to the stability degradation can be identified.

The investigation is based on the closed-loop model of the series-compensated power system consisted of the torsional and electrical open-loop subsystems. Analytical explanation is presented to show how the SSO modal repulsion is formed as the result of moving close and apart between two open-loop SSO modes. Analysis is carried out to indicate that the peak of the SSO modal repulsion occurs when the two  open-loop  SSO modes from the torsional and electrical subsystem are closest to each other on the complex plane, which is referred to as the open-loop modal coupling. Estimation on the peak, i.e., the maximum damping degradation of the SSO modes, is derived in the paper. Subsequently, a method of open-loop modal analysis is proposed. Applications of the proposed method of open-loop modal analysis to study the SSOs caused by the DFIGs under the condition of the modal repulsion in the power system are demonstrated and evaluated by example power systems. The concept of modal repulsion explains why the grid connection of the DFIGs may bring about the SSO instability risk in the power system.",

In this paper, an interconnected model of the ac/dc power system is derived. Analysis using the derived model indicates that under master\u2013slave control, the ac dynamic transients can propagate only unidirectionally through the VSC HVdc connection, and instability from a local ac system may not spread throughout the entire ac/dc power system through the VSC HVdc connection. However, under dc voltage droop control, the propagation becomes bidirectional between the VSCs that participate in the dc voltage droop control, and instability from the local ac system will spread throughout the ac/dc power system. In addition, even if the local ac subsystems are stable, the bidirectional propagation of ac dynamic transients through the VSC HVdc connection may still cause instability. Hence, implementation of dc voltage droop control increases the ac/dc power systemu0027s instability risk.",

The investigation does not rely on the representation of a wind farm by an aggregated wind generator and is based on a multi-input and multi-output closed-loop model. The model is comprised of the wind farm subsystem, which includes all the wind farms, and the subsystem of rest of power system (ROPS). Theoretical analysis proves that the open-loop SSO modal coupling of wind farm subsystem and ROPS subsystem results in the closed-loop SSO modal repulsion on the complex plane. Subsequently, damping of torsional SSOs decreases and growing SSOs may occur when the closed-loop modal repulsion is strong. Hence, closed-loop modal repulsion explains and reveals the mechanism about why the wind farms may cause the torsional SSOs in the power system. In addition, a method of open-loop modal analysis is proposed to detect the SSO instability risk brought about by the wind farms. The detection is based on the estimation of degree of closed-loop modal repulsion and only needs the modal information of open-loop subsystems. An example power system with wind farms is presented to demonstrate analysis and conclusions made in the paper.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the small-signal stability of an integrated multiterminal dc (MTDC)/ac power system. The examination is based on a closed-loop multi-input multi-output interconnected model of the MTDC/ac power system, which comprises an MTDC subsystem and an ac subsystem. The focus of the examination is the condition of open-loop modal coupling when an open-loop oscillation mode of the MTDC subsystem is close to an open-loop oscillation mode of the ac subsystem on the complex plane. Analysis in the paper indicates that when the open-loop modal coupling happens, the multivariable ac\u2013dc dynamic interactions between the MTDC and ac subsystems degrade the small-signal stability of the MTDC/ac power system. Estimation on the degree of stability degradation is derived. Hence, the paper reveals the mechanism about why the integration of the MTDC network may bring about the small-signal instability risk. In addition, a method of open-loop modal analysis to detect the risk is proposed. Example multimachine power systems with an MTDC network are presented to validate the analysis and conclusions made in the paper. Application of the proposed open-loop modal coupling analysis for parameter tuning of converter control systems of the MTDC network is demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the small-signal angular stability of a power system affected by a virtual synchronous generator (VSG). The examination is based on an interconnected model with two subsystems. The VSG under the examination is modeled as the VSG subsystem. The rest of power system (ROPS) forms the other subsystem. Damping torque analysis is applied to indicate that when an oscillation mode of VSG subsystem is in the proximity of an electromechanical oscillation mode of ROPS subsystem on the complex plane, strong dynamic interactions are introduced by the VSG to decrease the small-signal angular stability of the power system. This implies that when the parameters of the VSG are set, modal proximity of the VSG to the electromechanical oscillation mode of ROPS subsystem should be examined to avoid the detrimental impact of the VSG on power system small-signal angular stability. A method to evade the modal proximity is proposed in the paper for guiding the design of the VSG. An example power system with multiple VSGs for the wind power generation and transmission is presented. Study cases demonstrate and evaluate the analysis about the impact of modal proximity and proposed method for guiding the parameters setting of VSGs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   We proposed and applied the method of open-loop modal analysis previously for examining power system sub-synchronous oscillations (SSOs). However, the method was only applicable to grid-connected wind turbine generators, because we only theoretically proved the applicability of open-loop modal analysis for a single-input single-output (SISO) closed-loop interconnected model. In this study, we present the theoretical proof that in a multi-input multi-output closed-loop (MIMO) interconnected model, open-loop modal analysis is still applicable for examining power system SSOs by using the open-loop modal information. Hence, we propose to apply the open-loop modal analysis to detect the risk of growing SSOs caused by grid-connected wind farms, rather than wind turbine generators, in the power system. This is because in practice, dynamic interactions introduced by a grid-connected wind farm, in fact, constitute MIMO closed-loop interconnected model. Thus, the study has extended and enhanced the applicability of method of open-loop modal analysis. In the paper, the applicability is demonstrated and evaluated by example power systems with grid-connected wind farms. The SSO instability dangers brought about by the wind farms to the example power system were detected by the proposed method of open-loop modal analysis.",

The renewable power generation, VSC-based HVDC lines and multi-terminal DC (MTDC) network are connected to the AC power system via the VSCs. This paper reviews the recent main research progress and conclusions on the small-signal stability of the VSC-based DC/AC power system. The review covers the study on the small-signal stability of a grid-connected single VSC system, an integrated VSC-HVDC/AC power system and the MTDC/AC power system. It is explained in the paper why the study so far on the small-signal stability of the VSC-based DC/AC power system has been focused on examining the dynamic interactions between the converter control and the phase locked loop (PLL), between the multiple VSCs as well as between the VSCs and synchronous generators (SGs). The paper is concluded by summarizing the main factors affecting the small-signal stability of the VSC-based DC/AC power system. Gaps of study are listed and analyzed to call upon further investigation in order to fully reveal the mechanism about why the VSC-based DC/AC power system may loss the small-signal stability.",

In this research, we propose a new generalized Poisson-multinomial mixture approach to model grouped and right-censored (GRC) count data. Based on a mixed Poisson-multinomial process for conceptualizing grouped and right-censored count data, we prove that the new maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE-GRC) is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed for both Poisson and zero-inflated Poisson models. The use of the MLE-GRC, implemented in an R function, is illustrated by both statistical simulation and empirical examples. This research provides a tool for epidemiologists to estimate incidence from grouped and right-censored count data and lays a foundation for regression analyses of such data structure.",

Yet grouping or right-censoring decisions of count responses still rely on arbitrary choices made by researchers. We develop a new method for evaluating grouping and right-censoring decisions of count responses from a (semisupervised) machine-learning perspective. This article uses Poisson multinomial mixture models to conceptualize the data-generating process of count responses with grouping and right censoring and demonstrates the link between grouping-scheme choices and asymptotic distributions of the Poisson mixture. To search for the optimal grouping scheme maximizing objective functions of the Fisher information (matrix), an innovative three-step M algorithm is then proposed to process infinitely many grouping schemes based on Bayesian A-, D-, and E-optimalities. A new R package is developed to implement this algorithm and evaluate grouping schemes of count respons...",

Current evidences support that inflammatory reaction, oxidative stress, as well as abnormal insulin signaling in the hippocampus are potential causes of tau hyperphosphorylation and finally induce cognitive dysfunction. The present study aims to explore the effects of paeoniflorin on the cognitive deficits and investigate the underlying mechanisms in diabetic rats induced by a high-sucrose, high-fat diet and low dose of streptozotocin (STZ). Paeoniflorin treatment effectively improved the performance of diabetic rats in the Morris water maze test via decreasing escape latency and increasing the spent time in the target quadrant. Immunohistochemistry staining also had shown that tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus was prevented after paeoniflorin administration. This function was correlated with its abilities of reducing the brain inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1), decreasing suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2) expressions and promoting insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) activity. Additionally, we also found paeoniflorin administration significantly promoted the phosphorylation levels of protein kinase B (Akt) and glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2). Together, these results showed that paeoniflorin had beneficial effects on relieving diabetes-associated cognitive deficits via regulating SOCS2/IRS-1 pathway and might provide a feasible method for the treatment of diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive impairment has been recognized as a typical characteristic of neurodegenerative disease in diabetes mellitus (DM) and this cognitive dysfunction may be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Ferulic acid, a phenolic compound commonly found in a range of plants, has emerged various properties including anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. In the present study, the protective activities and relevant mechanisms of ferulic acid were evaluated in diabetic rats with cognitive deficits, which were induced by a high-glucose-fat (HGF) diet and low dose of streptozotocin (STZ). It was observed that ferulic acid significantly increased body weight and decreased blood glucose levels. Meanwhile, ferulic acid could markedly ameliorate spatial memory of diabetic rats in Morris water maze (MWM) and decrease AD-like pathologic changes (A\u03b2 deposition and Tau phosphorylation) in the hippocampus, which might be correlated with the inhibition of inflammatory cytokines release and reduction of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) expression. Moreover, the levels of brain insulin signal molecules p-IRS, p-Akt and p-GSK3\u03b2 were also investigated. We found that ferulic acid administration restored the alterations in insulin signaling. In conclusion, ferulic acid exhibited beneficial effects on diabetes-induced cognition lesions, which was involved in the regulation of PTP1B and insulin signaling pathway. We suppose that PTP1B inhibition may represent a promising approach to correct abnormal signaling linked to diabetes-induced cognitive impairment.",

Levo-tetrahydropalmatine (L-THP), a bioactive ingredient extracted from the Chinese herb Corydalis, can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and exert various pharmacological effects on neural tissues. The present study examined the neuroprotective effect of L-THP on neuronal apoptosis induced by cerebral I/R injury. Results showed that pretreatment with L-THP (12.5, 25, and 50\u00a0mg/kg) improved neurological outcomes and reduced infarct volume and cerebral edema in comparison with the brains of the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group. These findings provided evidence for the neuroprotective effects of L-THP against cerebral I/R injury. Furthermore, administration of L-THP enhanced the expression of Bcl-2 and attenuated the content of Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and PARP. L-THP could improve the reduction of NeuN-positive cells induced by I/R injury. These results suggested that L-THP could inhibit neuroapoptosis in cerebral ischemic rats. c-Abl was discovered as the critical protein responsible for neurocyte apoptosis; however, few data have been published on the relation between ischemic stroke and the expression of c-Abl. We found that both c-Abl expression and neuronal apoptosis were significantly increased in the MCAO group, while pretreatment with L-THP could ameliorate this effect. Therefore, we deduced that reduced c-Abl overexpression may play a role in the anti-apoptosis effect of L-THP after cerebral I/R injury. Thus, L-THP may provide a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Graphical Abstract \u115f.",

Radix Scutellariae from the dry root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, with the common name Baikal skullcap. In this study, we demonstrated that Radix Scutellariae (RS 500, 1000\u00a0mg/kg) notably improved the behavior of the rat, such as shortened escape latency in morris maze test, reduced immobility time in tail suspension test and in forced swimming test, as well as increased sucrose consumption in sucrose preference test. In addition, RS alleviated the damage CUMS-induced neurogenesis and the reduced levels of BrdU; DCX and NeuN, the neurons hallmark of hippocampus neurogenesis. Moreover, associated proteins in cAMP/PKA pathway were up-regulated after RS treatment. By HPLC analysis, we found that RS decoction contains four main components, including baicalin, baicalein, wogonoside and wogonin, respectively. In conclusion, RS could exert a natural antidepressant with improving depressive-like behavior via regulation of cAMP/PKA neurogenesis pathway.",

        "abstract": "Na/H exchanger 1 (NHE1), an important regulator of intracellular pH (pHi) and extracellular pH (pHe), plays a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes. However, the role of NHE1 in depression has not yet been reported. This study was designed to investigate the role of NHE1 in the animal model of depression and explore the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that inhibition of rho-associated kinase 2 (ROCK2) by fasudil (Fas) or baicalin (BA) significantly alleviated chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) paradigm-induced depression-related behaviours in mice, as shown by decreased sucrose consumption in sucrose preference test (SPT), reduced locomotor activity in the open field test (OFT), and increased immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST). Furthermore, ROCK2 inhibition inhibited the activation of NHE1, calpain1, and reduced neuronal apoptosis in the CUMS animal model of depression. Next, we used the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged animal model of depression to induce NHE1 activation. Our results revealed that mice subjected to 1\u2009\u03bcl LPS (10\u2009mg/ml) injection intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) showed depressive-like behaviours and NHE1 activation. Amiloride (Ami), an NHE1 inhibitor, significantly reversed the decrease in sucrose consumption and reduction in immobility time in the TST and FST induced by LPS challenge. Furthermore, Ami decreased the expression of ROCK2, NHE1, calpain1, and caspase-3 and increased the Bcl-1/Bax ratio in the hippocampus of LPS-challenged mice. Ami treatment also led to antidepressive effects in the CUMS-induced animal model of depression. Thus ROCK2 inhibition could be proposed as a neuroprotective strategy against neuronal apoptosis, and NHE1 might be a potential therapeutic target in depression.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Quercetin, a natural flavonoid abundantly found in onions, apples, tea, berries, cauliflower, and red wine, has been demonstrated to exert beneficial effect on Alzheimeru0027s disease. We aimed to investigate its AMPK activity on hyperphosphorylation of tau and explore the underlying mechanism associated with Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Quercetin and quercetin-3-O-glucuronide suppressed ER stress with decreased phosphorylation of IRE1\u03b1 and PERK, thereby inhibited TXNIP and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, ultimately attenuated tau phosphorylation in okadaic acid (OA) induced SH-SY5Y cells. However, the effect on tau phosphorylation was blocked by downregulation of AMPK\u03b11/2 with SiRNA transfection. Moreover, administration of quercetin enhanced AMPK activity, inhibited IRE1\u03b1 and PERK phosphorylation, NLRP3 expression and tau phosphorylation and improved cognitive disorder in mice exposed to high fat diets. AMPK may be a key player that links ER stress and tau phosphorylation and mediates quercetinu0027s effect on cognitive disorder. Thus, quercetin and its AMPK activity may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment of AD patients.",

        "abstract": "Chronic stress can provoke depressive-like behaviors through activation of inflammation and apoptosis, leading to a reduction of neurons. Antidepressant therapy may contribute to inhibiting inflammation responses and have neuroprotective effects. Baicalin (BA) has an antidepressant effect in the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) animal model and exerts anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, as well as neuroprotective effects in many central nervous system (CNS)-related diseases. But the effects of BA on neuroprotection, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation and the potential mechanisms in depression are unclear. Here, we focused on examining the therapeutic effects of BA in CUMS-induced depression rats and investigating the molecular mechanisms. Results showed that administration of BA improved depressive-like behaviors and significantly increased the levels of doublecortin (DCX), Neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in hippocampus. Furthermore, administration of BA increased the cell survival by reducing the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increasing the level of superoxide dismutase (SOD). Finally, administration of BA significantly decreased CUMS-induced apoptosis and inflammatory cytokines (caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2) in hippocampus. These responses were mediated by Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) \u03b2/Nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB)/Nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat, pyrin domain containing protein 3 (NLRP3) signal pathway. Taken together, these results indicate that BA could promote neuronal maturation and rescue neurons from apoptosis via inhibiting activation of GSK3\u03b2/NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 signal pathway that is known to be associated with inflammation, thus exerting neuroprotective effects and preventing CUMS-induced depressive-like behaviors.",

Oral administration of AS (40 and 60 \u00a0 mg/kg, once per day, started the day after surgery and lasted for 7 \u00a0 days) significantly ameliorated the memory impairment and the inflammation. Moreover, AS (20, 40 and 60 \u00a0 mg/kg) markedly reduced the microglial overactivation and the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in hippocampus compared with the transient cerebral ischemia and reperfusion group. These results suggested that AS showed the neuroprotective effect against transient cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in mice, and this effect might be associated with the anti-inflammation effect of AS via inhibiting overactivation of p38 MAPK pathway.",

        "abstract": "Apolipoproteins are protein component of plasma lipoproteins. They exert crucial roles in lipoprotein metabolism and serve as enzyme cofactors, receptor ligands, and lipid transfer carriers in mammals. In teleosts, apolipoproteins are also involved in diverse processes including embryonic and ontogenic development, liver and digestive system organogenesis, and innate immunity. In this study, we identified a set of 19 apolipoprotein genes in channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). Phylogenetic analysis and syntenic analysis were conducted to determine their identities and evolutionary relationships. The expression signatures of apolipoproteins in channel catfish were determined in healthy tissues and after infections with two major bacterial pathogens, Edwardsiella ictaluri and Flavobacterium columnare. In healthy channel catfish, most apolipoprotein genes exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns in channel catfish. After ESC and columnaris infections, 5 and 7 apolipoprotein genes were differentially expressed respectively, which presented a pathogen-specific and time-dependent pattern of regulation. After ESC infection, three exchangeable apolipoproteins (apoA-IB, apoC-I, and apoE-B) were suppressed in catfish intestine, while two nonexchangeable apolipoproteins (apoB-A and apoB-B) were slightly up-regulated. After columnaris infection, apoB-B, apoD-B, and apoE-A were significantly down-regulated in catfish gill, while apoF, apoL-IV, apoO-like, and apo-14\u00a0kDa showed significantly up-regulation. Taken together, these results suggested that apolipoprotein genes may play significant roles in innate immune responses to bacterial pathogens in channel catfish.",

In spite of their importance, systematic analysis of these genes in fish has been lacking. Here we report a systematic study of the NF-\u03baB related genes in channel catfish. Five NF-\u03baB family genes, five I\u03baB family genes and three IKK complex genes were identified in the channel catfish genome. Annotation of these 13 NF-\u03baB related genes was further confirmed by phylogenetic and syntenic analysis. Negative selection was found to play a crucial role in the adaptive evolution of these genes. Expression profiles of NF-\u03baB related genes after Flavobacterium columnare (columnaris) infection were determined by analysis of the existing RNA-Seq dataset. The majority of NF-\u03baB related genes were significantly regulated in mucosal tissues of gill, skin and intestine after columnaris infection, indicating their potential involvement in host defense responses. Distinct expression patterns of NF-\u03baB related genes were observed in susceptible and resistant catfish in response to columnaris infection, suggesting that expression of these genes may contribute to the variations in disease resistance/susceptibility of catfish.",

        "abstract": "Chemokines are a superfamily of structurally related chemotactic cytokines exerting significant roles in regulating cell migration and activation. They are defined by the presence of four conserved cysteine residues and are divided into four subfamilies depending on the arrangement of the first two conserved cysteines residues: CXC, CC, C and CX3C. In this study, a complete set of 17 CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL) genes was systematically identified and characterized from channel catfish genome through data mining of existing genomic resources. Phylogenetic analysis allowed annotation of the 17 CXC chemokines. Extensive comparative genomic analyses supported their annotations and orthologies, revealing the existence of fish-specific CXC chemokines and the expansion of CXC chemokines in the teleost genomes. The analysis of gene expression after bacterial infection indicated the CXC chemokines were expressed in a gene-specific manner. CXCL11.3 and CXCL20.3 were expressed significantly higher in resistant fish than in susceptible fish after ESC infection, while CXCL20.2 were expressed significantly higher in resistant fish than in susceptible fish after columnaris infection. The expression of those CXC chemokines, therefore can be a useful indicator of disease resistance. A similar pattern of expression was observed between resistant and susceptible fish with biotic and abiotic stresses, ESC, columnaris and hypoxia, suggesting that high levels of expression of the majority of CXC chemokines, with exception of CXC11 and CXC20, are detrimental to the host.",

        "abstract": "In aquatic organisms, hearing is an important sense for acoustic communications and detection of sound-emitting predators and prey. Channel catfish is a dominant aquaculture species in the United States. As channel catfish can hear sounds of relatively high frequency, it serves as a good model for study auditory mechanisms. In catfishes, Weberian ossicles connect the swimbladder to the inner ear to transfer the forced vibrations and improve hearing ability. In this study, we examined the transcriptional profiles of channel catfish swimbladder and other four tissues (gill, liver, skin, and intestine). We identified a total of 1777 genes that exhibited preferential expression pattern in swimbladder of channel catfish. Based on Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, many of swimbladder-enriched genes were categorized into sensory perception of sound, auditory behavior, response to auditory stimulus, or detection of mechanical stimulus involved in sensory perception of sound, such as coch, kcnq4, sptbn1, sptbn4, dnm1, ush2a, and col11a1. Six signaling pathways associated with hearing (Glutamatergic synapse, GABAergic synapse pathways, Axon guidance, cAMP signaling pathway, Ionotropic glutamate receptor pathway, and Metabotropic glutamate receptor group III pathway) were over-represented in KEGG and PANTHER databases. Protein interaction prediction revealed an interactive relationship among the swimbladder-enriched genes and genes involved in sensory perception of sound. This study identified a set of genes and signaling pathways associated with auditory system in the swimbladder of channel catfish and provide resources for further study on the biological and physiological roles in catfish swimbladder.",

        "abstract": "Barbels are important sensory organs in teleosts, reptiles, and amphibians. The majority of \u223c4,000 catfish species, such as the channel catfish (), possess abundant whisker-like barbels. However, barbel-less catfish, such as the bottlenose catfish (), do exist. Barbeled catfish and barbel-less catfish are ideal natural models for determination of the genomic basis for barbel development. In this work, we generated and annotated the genome sequences of the bottlenose catfish, conducted comparative and subtractive analyses using genome and transcriptome datasets, and identified differentially expressed genes during barbel regeneration. Here, we report that chemokine C-C motif ligand 33 (), as a key regulator of barbel development and regeneration. It is present in barbeled fish but absent in barbel-less fish. The  genes are differentially expressed during barbel regeneration in a timing concordant with the timing of barbel regeneration. Knockout of  genes in the zebrafish () resulted in various phenotypes, including complete loss of barbels, reduced barbel sizes, and curly barbels, suggesting that  is a key regulator of barbel development. Expression analysis indicated that paralogs of the  gene have both shared and specific expression patterns, most notably expressed highly in various parts of the head, such as the eye, brain, and mouth areas, supporting its role for barbel development.",

        "abstract": "Channel catfish is the leading aquaculture species in the US, and one of the reasons for its application in aquaculture is its relatively high tolerance against hypoxia. However, hypoxia can still cause huge economic losses to the catfish industry. Studies on hypoxia tolerance, therefore, are important for aquaculture. Fish swimbladder has been considered as an accessory respiration organ surrounded by a dense capillary countercurrent exchange system. In this regard, we conducted RNA-Seq analysis with swimbladder samples of catfish under hypoxic and normal conditions to determine if swimbladder was responsive to low oxygen treatment, and to reveal genes, their expression patterns and pathways involved in hypoxia responses in catfish. A total of 155 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from swimbladder of adult catfish, whereas a total of 2,127 DEGs were identified from swimbladder of fingerling catfish, under hypoxic condition as compared to untreated controls. Subsequent pathway analysis revealed that many DEGs under hypoxia were involved in HIF signaling pathway (nos2, eno2, camk2d2, prkcb, cdkn1a, eno1, and tfrc), MAPK signaling pathway (voltage-dependent calcium channel subunit genes), PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway (itga6, g6pc, and cdkn1a), Ras signaling pathway (efna3 and ksr2), and signaling by VEGF (fn1, wasf3, and hspb1) in catfish swimbladder. This study provided insights into regulation of gene expression and their involved gene pathways in catfish swimbladder in response to low oxygen stresses.",

        "abstract": "Channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) has been recognized as a dominant freshwater aquaculture species in the United States. It is also a suitable model for studying the mechanisms of sex determination and differentiation because of its sexual plasticity and exhibition of both genetic and environmental sex determination. The testicular differentiation in male channel catfish normally starts between 90 and 102 days postfertilization (dpf), while the ovarian differentiation starts early from 19 dpf. As such, efforts to better understand the postponed testicular development at the molecular level are needed. Toward that end, we conducted transcriptomic comparison of gene expression of male and female gonads at 90, 100, and 110 dpf using high-throughput RNA-Seq. Transcriptomic profiles of male gonads on 90 and 100 dpf exhibited high similarities except for a small number of significantly up-regulated genes that were involved in development of germ cell-supporting somatic cells, while drastic changes were observed during 100\u2013110 dpf, with a group of highly up-regulated genes that were involved in germ cells development, including nanog and pou5f1. Transcriptomic comparison between testes and ovaries identified male-preferential genes, such as gsdf, cxcl12, as well as other cytokines mediated the development of the gonad into a testis. Co-expression analysis revealed highly correlated genes and potential pathways underlying germ cell differentiation and spermatogonia stem cell development. The candidate genes and pathways identified in this study set the foundation for further studies on sex determination and differentiation in catfish as well as other teleosts.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Chemokines are a superfamily of structurally related chemotactic cytokines exerting significant roles in regulating cell migration and activation. Based on the arrangement of the first four cysteine residues, they are classified into CC, CXC, C and CX3C subfamilies. In this study, a complete set of 64 CC chemokine ligand (CCL) genes was systematically identified, annotated, and characterized from the channel catfish genome. Extensive phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses supported their annotations, allowing establishment of their orthologies, revealing fish-specific CC chemokines and the expansion of CC chemokines in the teleost genomes through lineage-specific tandem duplications. With 64 genes, the channel catfish genome harbors the largest numbers of CC chemokines among all the genomes characterized to date, however, they fall into 11 distinct CC chemokine groups. Analysis of gene expression after bacterial infections indicated that the CC chemokines were regulated in a gene-specific and time-dependent manner. While only one member of CCL19 (CCL19a.1) was significantly up-regulated after  Edwardsiella ictaluri  infection, all CCL19 members (CCL19a.1, CCL19a.2 and CCL19b) were significantly induced after  Flavobacterium columnare  infection. In addition, CCL19a.1, CCL19a.2 and CCL19b were also drastically up-regulated in ESC-susceptible fish, but not in resistant fish, suggesting potential significant roles of CCL19 in catfish immune responses. High expression levels of certain CC appeared to be correlated with susceptibility to diseases and intolerance to hypoxia.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Adaptor proteins non-catalytic region of tyrosine kinase (NCK) and Abelson interactor (ABI) are crucial for disease response. NCK1 was identified to be a candidate gene for enteric septicemia of catfish (ESC) disease resistance, and was speculated to play similar roles during ESC and enteropathogenic  Escherichia coli  (EPEC) pathogenicity. ABI1 was reported as a positional candidate gene for bacterial cold water disease (BCWD) resistance in rainbow trout. In this study, three NCK genes and six ABI genes were identified in the channel catfish ( Ictalurus punctatus ) genome and blue catfish ( I.\u00a0furcatus ) transcriptome, and annotated by domain structures, phylogenetic and syntenic analyses. Their expression patterns were examined in the intestine and liver of catfish after challenge with  Edwardsiella ictaluri . In the intestine, NCK1, ABI2a, ABI2b, ABI3a were differentially expressed after  E.\u00a0ictaluri  infection. In the liver, NCK2a, NCK2b, ABI1b, ABI2a, ABI2b were significantly upregulated in ESC susceptible fish. In general, the NCK and ABI genes, with exception of ABI3a gene and NCK1 gene, were expressed at higher levels in susceptible fish after infection than in control fish, but were expressed at lower levels in resistant fish than in the control fish. Taken together, these results support the notion that NCK and ABI genes are involved in disease processes facilitating pathogenesis of the  E.\u00a0ictaluri  bacteria.",

By a careful analysis on properties of cyclotomic cosets in the defining sets of two ingredient BCH codes and B(n, u0026#x03B4;2)4 that satisfies Bu0026#x2534;(n, u0026#x03B4;1)4 u0026#x2286; B (n, u0026#x03B4;2)4 used for constructing AQECCs, we derive new families of AQECCs with dz u003e u0026#x03b4;max + 1, and thus we can eliminate the unreasonable restriction dz u0026#x2264; u0026#x03B4;maxdevised in previous literature and obtain new AQECCs with greater asymmetry compared with the known results. Here u0026#x03B4;max is the maximal designed distance of Hermitian dual-containing narrow-sense BCH codes of length n = 4m -- 1/3.",

        "abstract": "The impact of graphene on the photo-absorption properties of trans- and cis-azobenzene monolayers is studied in the framework of density-functional theory and many-body perturbation theory. We find that, despite the weak hybridization between the electronic bands of graphene and those of the azobenzene monolayers, graphene remarkably modulates the absorption spectra of the adsorbates. The excitation energies are affected via two counteracting mechanisms: substrate polarization reduces the band-gap of azobenzene, and enhanced dielectric screening weakens the attractive interaction between electrons and holes. The competition between these two effects gives rise to an overall blueshift of peaks stemming from intramolecular excitations, and a redshift of peaks from intermolecular ones. Even more interesting is that excitations corresponding to intermolecular electron-hole pairs, which are dark in the isolated monolayers, are activated by the graphene substrate. Our results demonstrate that the photoisomerization process of weakly adsorbed azobenzene undergoes notable changes on a carbon-based substrate.",

        "abstract": "Sub-nano metal clusters often exhibit unique and unexpected properties, which make them particularly attractive as catalysts. Herein, we report a \"precursor-preselected\" wet-chemistry strategy to synthesize highly dispersed Fe clusters that are supported on mesoporous carbon nitride (mpg-CN). The obtained Fe/mpg-CN sample exhibits superior catalytic performance for the epoxidation of trans-stilbene to trans-stilbene oxide, showing outstanding selectivity of 93% at high conversion of 91%. Molecular oxygen is the only oxidant and no aldehyde is used as co-reagent. Under the same condition, by contrast, iron porphyrin, single-atom Fe, and small Fe nanoparticles (ca. 3\u2009nm) are nearly reactively inert. First-principles calculations reveal that the unique reactivity of the Fe clusters originates from the formation of active oxygen species. The general applicability of the synthesis approach is further demonstrated by producing other diatomic clusters like Pd and Ir, which lays the foundation for discovering diatomic cluster catalysts.",

        "abstract": "Single-atom catalysts (SACs) combine the best of two worlds by bridging heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. The superior catalytic properties of SACs, however, can hardly be exploited without a suitable substrate. Here, we explore the possibility of using hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites as supporting materials for single transition-metal atoms. By means of first-principles calculations, we predict that single Pt atoms can be incorporated into methylammonium lead iodide surfaces by replacing the methylammonium groups at the outermost layer. The iodide anions at the surface provide potentially uniform anchoring sites for the Pt atoms and donate electrons, generating negatively charged Pt_{1}^{\u03b4-} species that allow for preferential O_{2} adsorption in the presence of CO. Such Pt sites are able to catalyze CO oxidation and may also play a role in CO_{2} reduction. The fundamental understanding generated here will shed light on potential applications of hybrid perovskites in the field of (photo)catalysis.",

In this work, we study the level alignment at the interface between graphene fluoride and boron nitride monolayers. These two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are representative wide-bandgap components for van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. We perform a systematic study on the structural and electronic properties of their interface, by using density functional theory and the G0W0 method of many-body perturbation theory. We adopt this interface as a prototypical system to investigate the impact of polarization effects on band gap and level alignment. We find a small but still notable polarization-induced reduction of the materials\u2019 band gap by 250 meV that we interpret and analyze in terms of an image-potential model. Such effects stem from nonlocal correlations between electrons and cannot be captured by semilocal or standard hybrid density functionals. Our work provides a low...",

Being nonperturbative, the formalism also applies in the strong-coupling case.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we demonstrate the enhanced photodegradation of rhodamine B on polarized ferroelectric KNbO3 (KNO) particles. High-quality KNO samples were prepared using a solid-state reaction and polarized under different electric fields. The variation of XRD and piezoelectric coefficient (d33) suggest an increased intensity of the ferroelectric polarization in the polarized samples. In contrast to the slow photodegradation rate of unpolarized KNO, the normalized photodegradation reaction rate constant was remarkably increased to 0.317 min\u22121 by the polarized KNO. The longer photoluminescence lifetime indicates that the enhancement of photocatalytic activity in polarized ferroelectric KNO powder is mainly attributed to the enhanced internal field. We believe this work may open up new avenues in photocatalysis using polarized ferroelectric materials.",

The coexistence of the two diseases increases the risk of thromboembolism events. Although CHADS and CHADS-VASc scores have been used in the evaluation of the thromboembolism events in AF patients, the different levels of the blood pressure are not appropriately recognized. In this study, the 970 AF patients were divided into three groups according to the severity of hypertension. The CHADS and CHADS-VASc scores in the patients of grade 3 hypertension were significantly higher than those of the patients with grade 1 and 2 hypertension, respectively (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Both the CHADS and CHADS-VASc scores were positively related to the severity of hypertension (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Our data demonstrated that three grades for hypertensive subjects with AF significantly improved antithrombotic risk stratification in addition to current clinical risk stratification models, such as CHADS and CHADS-VASc scores.",

We collected data related to the patients' demographic characteristics, history of chronic diseases and lifestyle factors in 2258 patients with primary hypertension. Logistic regression models based on odds ratio (OR) with their associated 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to estimate an independent effect of homocysteine (Hcy) on the risk of stroke but also include the interactions between Hcy and other risk factors. Hcy was associated with an increased OR of the risk of stroke in both hypertension patients (OR, 1.027; 95% CI, 1.016-1.038; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and H-type hypertension patients (OR, 1.026; 95% CI, 1.014-1.037; P\u2009<\u20090.001), after adjustment for potential confounding factors. Among the hypertension participants, three tests of interactions between Hcy and other risk factors were statistically significant: sex, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. In conclusion, complexities of the interactions of Hcy stratified by sex and blood pressure need to be considered in predicting overall risk and selecting certain treatments for stroke prevention.",

Glioblastoma (GBM) genes expression profiling chip of 529 disease samples and 10 normal samples selected from TCGA database were used for analysis, 25 brain glioma tissue samples and 15 normal brain tissues were collected in the Department of Neurosurgery of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University in China from 2016 to 2017 to analyze CAPG genes. TCGA results showed that the expression level of CAPG genes in GBM was higher than that in normal tissues, and the expression level of men, aged over 46 years and high grade gliomas in pathological stages was higher than that of women, aged \u226446 and low grade gliomas in pathological stages, and the survival time of high expression was shorter than that of low expression. The expression level of CAPG in glioma tissues was higher than that in normal tissues, and the expression level of CAPG in males was higher than that in females, as males had lymphatic transfer and low differentiation compared with females, but the expression level was not related to age. Survival analysis showed that higher expression level indicated shorter survival time, they were positively correlated. The expression of CAPG in glioma is high, and it is highly expressed with the severity of the disease, and it is also obviously related to the prognosis. Therefore, CAPG could be used as a biomarker for pathological grade and prognosis in glioma. However, the related studies are not consistent on the expression of different sex and ages, so further study is needed.",

However, the clinical and prognostic significance of LINC00599 in glioma patients and the effect of LINC00599 on glioma cell migration and invasion remain unknown. In our results, we firstly observe the expression of LINC00599 in thirty-one types of human cancers including tumor tissues and corresponding normal tissues at The Cancer Genome Atlas database, and found that LINC00599 expression levels were only reduced in lower grade glioma tissues and glioblastoma multiforme tissues compared with normal brain tissues. Moreover, we confirmed levels of LINC00599 expression were decreased in glioma tissues and cell lines compared with matched adjacent normal tissues and normal human astrocytes, respectively. Meanwhile, we found that glioma tissues with WHO \u2162-\u2163 grade exhibited lower levels of LINC00599 expression than glioma tissues with \u2160-\u2161 grade. The survival analysis at TCGA data showed low LINC00599 expression was associated with poor disease free survival and overall survival in glioma patients. In vitro study suggested up-regulation of LINC00599 depressed glioma cell migration and invasion through regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition process. In conclusion, LINC00599 acts as a tumor-suppressing lncRNA in glioma.",

In this paper, an acoustic based traffic monitoring system is designed and implemented. The system utilizes a cross microphone array to collect road-side acoustic signals. Then, lane positions are automatically detected by the built-in lane detection module. Eventually, different measuring indices which reflect the road condition and traffic quality are derived according to the collected signals and the detected lanes. Since acoustic sensor is less expensive than other types of vehicle sensors, and acoustic features are robust against light, weather, and environmental variations, we expect that the proposed acoustic traffic monitoring system will have lower hardware cost, and become a good complement to the existing traffic monitoring techniques.",

A modified Signal presence probability (SPP), which is in consideration of reverberation, is proposed with a novel estimator Direct-toreverberate ratio (DRR) to adapt to distant-talking scene. SPP is known a key estimator to instruct the updating of transient noise or residual directional interference and form gain function in the time-frequency domain, consequently a new desired signal detection scheme is proposed to improve its accuracy. Appropriate spectral enhancement technique is applied to the noisy speech signal taking advantage of the modified SPP estimator. The proposed multi-channel post-filtering is tested in different nonstationary noisy and reverberant environments. Experimental results show that it achieves considerable improvement on signal preservation of the desired speech with more noise reduction over the comparative algorithms.",

        "abstract": "One of the main difficulties in Acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) is that the filter adaptation needs to vary according to different situations such as near-end interferences and echo path changes. In this paper, we propose a robust step-size control algorithm in frequency domain. The proposed method is based on the optimization of the square of the bin-wise a posteriori error. Constraint on the filter update is applied, which contributes to robustness to near-end interferences of the algorithm. The learning rate formula is derived first and then the relationship between the proposed algorithm and a robust statistics based approach is revealed. The method is extended to the Multidelay block frequency domain adaptive filter (MDF) so as to meet the demand of low delay in practical application. Moreover, the values of the constraints are designed to be updated proportionately to improve the convergence property. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm.",

However, its performance often degrades rapidly in reverberantenvironments. In this paper, a novel dual-microphoneSSL algorithm is proposed to address this problem. First, thetime-frequency regions dominated by direct sound are extractedby tracking the envelopes of speech, reverberation and backgroundnoise. The time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) is thenestimated by considering only these reliable regions. Second,a bin-wise de-aliasing strategy is introduced to make better useof the DOA information carried at high frequencies, where thespatial resolution is higher and there is typically less corruptionby diffuse noise. Our experiments show that when comparedwith other widely-used algorithms, the proposed algorithm producesmore reliable performance in realistic reverberant environments.",

Owing to tunable interferometric couplers, the proposed device is capable of realizing an increase in adjustable channel spacing for a given field coupling coefficient. By carefully controlling the path phase differences and tunable interferometric couplers, the transmission spectra of adjacent channels can be selectively combined to form adjustable bandwidths as desired. As an example, an integrated flexible-grid 1 \u00d7 2 wavelength-selective switch is designed and theoretically analyzed. The channel spacing can increase from 0.1 to 0.8\u00a0nm. When the channel spacing is selected to be 0.8 nm, the bandwidth varies from 0.36 to 2.91\u00a0nm and a minimum extinction ratio of 14.8\u00a0dB is obtained.",

The device is designed by utilizing a structure with four triple series-coupled microring resonators. By changing the Fermi level of graphene to lead to the variation of the modal effective index, the transmission spectra of triple series-coupled microring resonators can be coherently combined to provide the adjustable bandwidth as desired. A detailed analysis of the designed device is presented. Numerical simulations show that the effective bandwidth tuning range from 2.70 to 6.30 nm can be obtained when each microring resonator is independently controlled. With the maximum bandwidth tunability, the designed tunable filter has a minimum extinction ratio larger than 92.35 dB.",

The whole population is divided into several child-groups with different study mechanism, and each group can corporate or compete with others. The Gaussian mutation is introduced to avoid the algorithm falling into local minima. Then, combined MSPSO with delay and area estimation model and polarity conversion, MSPSO is used to search the best polarity of FPRM circuit. Some MCNC Benchmark circuits are used to test the proposed algorithm, and the result shows that the MSPSO algorithm has good performance in FPRM circuit optimization. In addition, the average savings of area and delay is 33.17% and 13.28% in comparison with the other algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Although there has been a longstanding curiosity about the socio-political consequences of China\u2019s remarkable urban\u2013rural divide, we have yet to understand the divide\u2019s possible influence on mental health. Using data from the 2016 wave of the China Labor-force Dynamics Survey (CLDS), we find that depressive symptoms of both rural\u2013urban migrants and rural residents are significantly higher than those of urban residents. Consistent with the fundamental-causes-of-disease and stress-exposure perspectives, results from zero-inflated negative binomial regression suggest that such differences in depressive symptoms can be attributed to socioeconomic status and proximate stressors such as unemployment, living alone, and the unaffordability of medical services. In particular, the rural\u2013urban difference in depressive symptoms is explained away by educational attainment. A further investigation using spline Poisson regression suggests that the protective effects of the period of middle school, which vary substantial...",

PubMed, MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science and nearly 5 years of the important international conference on oncology records were searched for randomized clinical trials that compared lapatinib plus trastuzumab and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with trastuzumab in combination with NAC and that included pathologic complete response rate as the primary outcome. Finally, 6 clinical randomized controlled trials were included. Meta-analysis shows that pathological complete response rate was significantly increased in trastu-zumab plus lapatinib group than single use trastuzumab group (53.4%, 40.4%, RR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.38 ~ 2.23, pu003c0.001). In conclusion, the combination of trastuzumab and lapatinib added to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in HER2 positive breast cancer is more effective.",

        "abstract": "Qufengtongluo (QFTL) decoction is an effective treatment for diabetic nephropathy (DN). However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we try to investigate whether QFTL decoction acts via inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Twenty-four GK rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: blank group, sham-operated group, and QFTL group. After model establishment, rats in QFTL group were given QFTL decoction by gavage, while the rest were given pure water. During the 8-week intervention, 24\u2009hr urinal protein was measured every 2-3 weeks. After intervention, kidneys were removed for pathological smear, quantitative real-time PCR, and western blotting to detect expression levels of p-PI3K, p-Akt, PTEN, TGF-, PI3K mRNA, Akt mRNA, PTEN mRNA, and TGF- mRNA. QFTL group showed a slighter degree of renal fibrosis in Masson and PASM staining and a greater reduction of 24\u2009hr urinal protein than blank group. Compared to blank group, expression levels of p-PI3K, p-Akt, PI3K mRNA, and Akt mRNA were lower in QFTL group, while expression levels of PTEN and PTEN mRNA were higher. Besides, TGF- was downregulated by QFTL decoction. In conclusion, this study suggests that QFTL decoction might inhibit PI3K/Akt signaling pathway via activating PTEN and inhibiting TGF-.",

The correlation between driven force and zero-point of sensor is summarized according to the temperature characteristic of the air-damping and resonant frequency of sensor header. A constant trans-conductance high-linearity amplifier is designed to realize the low phase-drift and low amplitude-drift interface circuit at all-temperature range. The chip is fabricated in a standard 0.5 \u03bcm CMOS process. Compensation achieved by driven force to zero-point drift caused by the stiffness of physical construction and air-damping is adopted. Moreover, the driven force can be obtained from the drive-circuit to avoid the complex sampling. The test result shows that the zero-point drift is lower than 30\u2218/h (1-sigma) at the temperature range from \u221240\u2218C to 60\u2218C after three-order compensation made by driven force.",

        "abstract": "Emerging evidence from graft manipulations and immunotherapeutic treatments has highlighted a favorable effect of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). However, \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subsets and their distinct features in the allograft have not been characterized. Additionally, whether homeostatic \u03b3\u03b4 T cell fractions are influenced by treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) remains elusive. We initially compared the phenotypes of \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subsets, including CD27, CD27, V\u03b41, V\u03b42, V\u03b41CD27, V\u03b41CD27, V\u03b42CD27, and V\u03b42CD27 cells, in the peripheral blood of 20 healthy donors before and after G-CSF mobilization. The effects of G-CSF on the cytokine production capacities of \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subsets were also detected. Moreover, the correlation between donor homeostatic \u03b3\u03b4 T cell content and the early recoveries of \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subgroups after haploidentical HSCT was investigated in 40 pairs of donors and recipients. We found that both the proportions and IFN-\u03b3 secretion capacities of peripheral \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subsets were preserved in G-CSF-primed grafts. Homeostatic V\u03b41 and V\u03b42 proportions of donors significantly correlated with the early recoveries of V\u03b41 and V\u03b42 cells after haploidentical HSCT. Interestingly, a higher day 30 V\u03b41 concentration was associated with a lower incidence of cytomegalovirus reactivation in recipients. These results not only clarify the preservation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cell phenotypes and functional features by G-CSF mobilization but also suggest the importance of homeostatic \u03b3\u03b4 T cell content for immune recovery after alloHSCT.",

Reconstitution of adaptive T lymphocytes is generally compromised at the early stages following transplant, suggesting an important role of other effector cells in preventing EBV infection. Our previous studies demonstrated that recovery of CD4 CD8 T cells negatively correlated with EBV reactivation after haploHSCT. In this prospective study on 132 adult patients with haematopoietic malignancy, recovery of T-cell subpopulations was characterized post-haploHSCT. We showed that the median counts of peripheral V\u03b42 cells were continuously lower in recipients with EBV reactivation compared with controls at 30, 60 and 90\u00a0days after haploHSCT (P values: 0\u00b7006, <0\u00b7001 and 0\u00b7019, respectively). Landmark study further indicated that the cumulative incidence of EBV reactivation was significantly decreased in recipients with higher day-30\u00a0V\u03b42 counts. Activation of V\u03b42 cells upon EBV reactivation was accompanied by an induction of cell apoptosis. Cytotoxic effect of V\u03b42 cells on EBV-infected cells was confirmed by in\u00a0vitro experiments. Together, our findings uncovered a significant correlation of recovered V\u03b42 with EBV reactivation following haploHSCT. These results will help to better understand the intrinsic anti-virus immunity and develop \u03b3\u03b4 T-based therapy strategies after haematopoietic transplantation.",

        "abstract": "Background : Immune recovery is recognized to be crucial for decreasing morbidity of the subsequent complications in patients who underwent alloHSCT. We recently compared the recoveries of T-cell subpopulations between the haploHSCT recipients with and without EBV-DNAemia and found that lower CD4/CD8 double negative T-cell (DNT) counts were significantly correlated with the increased cumulative incidence of EBV reactivation after transplantation. Multivariate analysis further showed that hampered recovery of DNT cells was an independent risk factor to predict transplant-related mortality. Based on the expression of \u03b1\u03b2 or \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell receptors, or NK cell markers, several subpopulations of DNT cells have been identified, e.g. TCR-\u03b3/\u03b4+DNT, TCR-\u03b1/\u03b2+DNT, NKT cells, and other cells that are incompletely characterized. Early recovery levels of DNT subsets may correlate to the occurrence of HSCT complications. Notably, reconstitution kinetics of these special T-cell subpopulations post-HSCT remains unknown.   Method : A prospective study was conducted to observe the comprehensive characteristics of DNT recovery. Fifteen healthy donors and 60 consecutive patients who were diagnosed as hematological malignancy and underwent haploHSCT at our institute were included. Immnophenotyping analysis was performed to determine the recovery levels of DNT and its subpopulations including \u03b1/\u03b2+DNT, \u03b3/\u03b4+DNT (V\u03b41+ and V\u03b42+), and CD56+DNT at 30, 60, and 90 days after transplantation.   Result : Percentages of total DNT, \u03b1/\u03b2+DNT, and \u03b3/\u03b4+DNT in recipients on day 30 were comparable with those of health donors (defined as normal range). While the percentage of total DNT significantly decreased on day 60 and day 90, percentages of \u03b1/\u03b2+DNT and \u03b3/\u03b4+DNT were quite stable within the 3 months after haploHSCT. Interestingly, ratio of V\u03b41+/ V\u03b42+ on day 30 was similar with the normal control, which was significantly reversed on day 60 and day 90. In contrast, the percentage of CD56+DNT on day 30 was 3-fold higher than the normal range, which dropped down to the normal level at 60 and 90 days. In term of the absolute numbers, all detected DNT subpopulations were hampered at 30 days post-transplantation. Only the counts of V\u03b41+DNT achieved the normal level at 60 and 90 days whereas numbers of other DNT subpopulations were continuously lower during the evaluation period. The pace of V\u03b42+DNT recovery was the slowest compared with others.   Conclusion : Our observations give a picture of the dynamic recovery of DNT subpopulations and contribute to comprehensively understand the characteristics of immune recovery after HaploHSCT. The clinical impact of DNT-subpopulations recovery will be evaluated in the ongoing prospective study. These findings may facilitate the intervention strategies to improve the general outcome of haploHSCT recipients.  Disclosures  No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",

        "abstract": "Background.  Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation remains one of the life-threatening complications in recipients undergone haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haploHSCT). Reconstitution of traditional adaptive T lymphocytes is generally compromised at the early stage following transplantation, suggesting an important role of other immune effector cells in preventing from EBV reactivation. Our previous studies demonstrated that hampered recovery of CD4 - CD8 -  T cells was associated with an increased occurrence of EBV reactivation after haploHSCT. \u03b3\u03b4 T is a dominant subgroup of CD4 - CD8 -  T cells in the peripheral blood of healthy donors. Correlation of reconstituted \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with EBV reactivation has not been reported in the context of allogeneic HSCT.   Methods.  This study prospectively included 132 adult patients with hematopoietic malignancy and receiving haploHSCT. Recovery characteristics of T-cell subpopulations were monitored by flow cytometry at 30, 60, and 90 days after haploHSCT. EBV-DNA loads in the peripheral blood were detected by real-time quantitative PCR before and after transplantation. Association between \u03b3\u03b4 T recovery and EBV reactivation were statistically analyzed.   Results.  The median counts of peripheral V\u03b42 cells were continuously lower in recipients with EBV reactivation compared with controls at 30, 60, and 90 days post-haploHSCT ( P  value was 0.006,   0.1, respectively).   Conclusions.  We clarified a specific association of recovered V\u03b42 but not V\u03b41 T cells with EBV reactivation following haploHSCT. These results may help better understand the intrinsic anti-EBV immunity after allogeneic HSCT and develop effective \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell-based therapy strategies.

        "abstract": "Haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT) has been an alternative source of bone marrow for patients without human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donors. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between platelet transfusion refractoriness (PTR) and clinical outcomes in the setting of haplo-SCT. Between May 2012 and March 2014, 345 patients who underwent unmanipulated haplo-SCT were retrospectively enrolled. PTR occurred in 20.6% of all patients. Patients in the PTR group experienced higher transplant-related mortality (TRM, 43.7% vs. 13.5%, P<0.001), lower overall survival (OS, 47.9% vs. 76.3%, P<0.001) and lower leukemia-free survival (LFS, 47.9% vs. 72.3%, P<0.001) compared to patients in the non-PTR group. The multivariate analysis showed that PTR was associated with TRM (P=0.002), LFS (P<0.001), and OS (P<0.001). The cumulative incidences of PTR in patients receiving >12 platelet (PLT) transfusions (third quartile of PLT transfusions) were higher than in patients receiving either >6 (second quartile) or >3 (first quartile) PLT transfusions (56.1% vs. 41.6% vs. 28.2%, respectively; P<0.001). The multivariate analysis also showed that PTR was associated with the number of PLT transfusions (P<0.001). PTR could predict poor transplant outcomes in patients who underwent haploidentical SCT.",

Our recent work demonstrated the capability of bioactive glass in supporting bone healing and defect bridging using a rabbit femur segmental defect model without growth factors or bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Here in the current work, a comprehensive in vitro evaluation of bioactive silicate (13-93) and borosilicate (2B6Sr) glass scaffolds was conducted to provide further understanding of their biological performances and to establish a correlation between in vitro and in vivo behaviors. Our in vitro evaluation using a murine MC3T3-E1 cell line confirmed the capability of both scaffolds to support cell attachment, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) formation, and to stimulate mineral deposition and osteoblast marker gene expression. In particular, borosilicate (2B6Sr) glass showed a better capability in supporting the mineralization and gene expression than silicate (13-93) glass, consistent with a faster bone healing ability in vivo. The current in vitro results, combined with our previous in vivo findings, provide a strong basis for the further translational evaluation of bioactive glass scaffolds and for potential preclinical practice. \u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A comprehensive evaluation of the mechanical properties of inorganic scaffolds and exploration of new ways to toughen brittle constructs are critical prior to their successful application in loaded sites. A simple and widely adopted approach involves the coating of an inorganic scaffold with a polymeric material. In this work, a systematic evaluation of the influence of a biopolymer, polycaprolactone (PCL), coating on the mechanical performance of bioactive glass scaffolds was carried out. Results from this work indicate that a biopolymer PCL coating was more effective in increasing the compressive strength and reliability of the glass scaffold under compression, but less effective in improving its flexural strength or fracture toughness. This is the first report that reveals the limited successfulness of a polymer coating in improving the toughness of strong scaffolds, suggesting that new and novel ways of toughening inorganic scaffolds should be future research directions for scaffolds applied in loaded sites. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "abstract": "Urban governance and its impact on contentious politics have received remarkably little attention in existing studies on mental health. Drawing on a measure of neighborhood conflicts developed in a survey of thirty-nine urban neighborhoods in Guangzhou, China, this article investigates the potential link between urban governance and mental health. Net of sociodemographic, relational, and environmental measures, it finds that among residents' conflicts with different entities of urban governance, only those with local/grassroots governments are significantly associated with more depressive symptoms. Moreover, these subgroups of government-oriented conflicts associated with more depressive symptoms are related to neighborhood planning and communal properties, reflecting a dilemma in the Chinese model of urban governance. By offering a relational interpretation of neighborhood conflicts, this study not only challenges the previous view that community building in China improves mental health, but calls attention to the significance of urban governance in research on mental health.",

Based on survey data from 39 neighborhoods in Guangzhou, China, this study assesses the relationship between communal space and depression. To unravel the relational and psycho-spatial embeddedness of communal space, a structural equation analysis suggests that neither the use of nor the sense of communal space has a direct association with depressive symptoms. Instead, the indirect effect of the use of communal space on depression is mediated by neighborhood-based social networks and neighborhood attachment, while the indirect effect of the sense of communal space on depression is only mediated by neighborhood attachment. Given the presence of indirect relational and psycho-spatial pathways linking communal space and depression, this study argues that the place-making and relational approaches should be integrated to provide a holistic view of the socio-spatial nature of urban landscape.",

The DSC results showed that the curing peak temperature of BZPOSS/BADCy blend decrease significantly from 317.1\u202f\u00b0C to 160.3\u202f\u00b0C, suggesting the high catalytic activity of BZPOSS to the polymerization of cyanate ester. The SEM micrographs of poly(BZPOSS/BADCy) and Silicon element distribution maps given by EDS both indicated that BZPOSS disperses evenly in BADCy. Dielectric properties tests showed that the dielectric constant can be reduced by the introduction of BZPOSS, which is attributed to the nano-pores from the cage structure of POSS. When 15\u202fwt% BZPOSS was added, the dielectric constant decreased to 2.01 and the dielectric loss was also only 0.0070 at 1\u202fMHz. Meanwhile, DMA and TGA result showed that the thermal stability and heat resistance of poly(BZPOSS/BADCy) at high temperature decreased with increasing BZPOSS, which is due to the change of crosslinking structure of the copolymers. The influences of the crosslinking structure and the nano-porous organic-inorganic hybrid particles on the dielectric and thermal property of poly(BZPOSS/BADCy) were also discussed.",

It is confirmed by FTIR spectra that the new polybenzoxazines mainly consist of arylamine Mannich-type linkage other than phenolic Mannich-type linkage in conventional polybenzoxazines. Owing to the unique chemical structures, the arylamine Mannich polybenzoxazines possess more weak \u2212OH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 hydrogen bonding but less strong and rigid chelated hydrogen bonding. As a result of the special chemical structures and hydrogen bonding distribution, the arylamine Mannich polybenzoxazines possess many unique properties. For example, they are more flexible. Tensile tests show that the arylamine Mannich polybenzoxazines could be stronger and tougher than phenolic Mannich polybenzoxazine. The highest tensile strength increases 83% while elongation at break value increases 115% for 002P180 (arylamine Mannich polybenzoxazine) compared with PBA-a200 (p...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Dicyclopentadiene phenol epoxy resin (DCPD) was modified by polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane bearing benzoxazinyl groups (BZPOSS), and the corresponding nanocomposites were prepared. BZPOSS worked as copolymer and curing agent, thus the curing reaction of DCPD and BZPOSS could undergo readily without extra curing agents. SEM images showed that BZPOSS was monodisperse in the nanocomposites with the size of around 50\u202fnm. Dielectric properties were improved by incorporation of micro-porous BZPOSS and the lowest dielectric constant of 2.14 was obtained for poly(DCPD/BZPOSS) with 20\u202fwt% BZPOSS. The  T  g  obtained by DMA tests increased with increasing amount of BZPOSS and the highest  T  g  was 259\u202f\u00b0C, 101\u202f\u00b0C higher than epoxy resin cured by 2-methylimidazole. Crosslinking density and storage modulus at rubbery state of the nanocomposites increased more than 16 times by BZPOSS. Initial decomposition temperatures of poly(DCPD/BZPOSS)s increased by more than 100\u202f\u00b0C and the char yield increased about 35% with 40\u202fwt% loading of BZPOSS.",

The pristine globular graphene (G) was intercalated by trichlorophenylsilane and formed more single layer graphene, which was verified by TEM images. Good dispersion of GS decreased the percolation threshold to less than 1\u202fwt%. The conductivity increased greatly and reached 0.0032\u202fS/cm with the addition of 20\u202fwt% of GS, and the corresponding nanocomposites showed the highest shielding effectiveness (SE) of 40.9\u202fdB over the range of X-band. And the SE was found to be dominated by absorption, which could effectively reduce the secondary pollution of electromagnetic wave. Additionally, the mechanical strength, storage modulus at rubbery state, and chemical cross-linking density were highly improved by the addition of GS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Polymerization reaction of a typical thermosetting benzoxazine monomer, BA-a, is tailored intentionally by particular Lewis acids including aluminium trichloride (AlCl 3 ), phosphorus pentachloride (PCl 5 ) and zinc chloride (ZnCl 2 ), and polybenzoxazines with different crosslinking structures are obtained. Their rheological behaviors, polymerization mechanisms, chemical crosslinking structures and thermal properties are systematically studied. The results suggest that AlCl 3  and PCl 5  are much more efficient than ZnCl 2  to affect the polymerization reaction of BA-a. PCl 5  and AlCl 3  can promote the generation of more carbocations, thus the polymerization of benzoxazine follows cationic chain polymerization mechanism. However, in the presence of less effective ZnCl 2  or in the case of neat benzoxazine, the polymerization follows step polymerization mechanism. It is learned that the Lewis acids can promote crosslinking reaction of dangling arylamine benzene rings and form arylamine Mannich linkages that vary with the catalytic efficiency of the Lewis acids. As a result, the increase of impact strength by 36.4%, the increase of flexural strength by 243.4%, the increase of flexural modulus by 42% and the increase of char yield by 18.6% (absolute value) can be achieved by using different Lewis acids.",

        "abstract": "Homeostasis of ClO/HS plays a crucial role in the damage and repair of gastric tissue, but has rarely been investigated due to the challenge of in situ analysis in the highly acidic gastric environment. Herein, we designed a new H-activated optical mechanism, involving controllable photoinduced electron transfer (PET) and switch of electron push-pull (SEPP), to develop the simple yet multifunctional probe (Z)-4-(2-benzylidenehydrazinyl)-7-nitrobenzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazole (BNBD). First, the BNBD probe (Off) was protonated by the highly acidic media to trigger strong fluorescence (On). Then, the analytes ClO and HS reacted with the protonated BNBD, leading to ultrasensitive (ClO: 2.7 nM and HS: 6.9 nM) fluorescence quenching via the rapid oxidation of C[double bond, length as m-dash]N (50 s) and nitro reduction (10 s), respectively. With the logical discrimination by absorbance/colour (ClO: 300 nm/colorless and HS: 400 nm/orange), a strategy for the in situ quantification of ClO/HS in gastric mucosa and juice was developed. For the first time, the in situ quantitative monitoring of endogenous HS and ClO/HS homeostasis as well as the pathologic manifestation in gastric mucosa were realized, thus overcoming the challenge of ClO/HS analysis under highly acidic conditions and enabling the in situ tissue quantification of ClO/HS. In combination with the assessment of mucosal damage, this study confirms the injurious/rehabilitative effects of ClO/HS on gastric mucosa (at 50-90 \u03bcm depth), which may facilitate the auxiliary diagnosis of stomach diseases induced by oxidative stress.",

        "abstract": "Determination of plant growth regulators (PGRs) in a signal transduction system (STS) is significant for transgenic food safety, but may be challenged by poor accuracy and analyte instability. In this work, a microwave-assisted extraction-derivatization (MAED) method is developed for six acidic PGRs in oil samples, allowing an efficient (u003c1.5 h) and facile (one step) pretreatment. Accuracies are greatly improved, particularly for gibberellin A(3) (-2.72 to -0.65%) as compared with those reported (-22 to -2%). Excellent selectivity and quite low detection limits (0.37-1.36 ng mL(-1)) are enabled by fluorescence detection-mass spectrum monitoring. Results show the significant differences in acidic PGRs between transgenic and nontransgenic oils, particularly 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (1-NAA), implying the PGRs induced variations of components and genes. This study provides, for the first time, an accurate and efficient determination for labile PGRs involved in STS and a promising concept for objectively evaluating the safety of transgenic foods.",

Essentially different from the routine sensing mechanism, a special mechanism of photo-induced electron transfer (PET) combining with large absorption red-shift (rather than emission) has been designed to develop a facile yet multifunctional probe for the simultaneous fluorimetric, absorption-ratiometric and colorimetric detections of \u03b1-KA in biological samples. Effective inhibition of PET ensured the intense fluorescence turn-on (60 fold) and qutie low detection limit (0.9\u00a0\u03bcM) for \u03b1-KA without need of any surfacants. Dramatical colour change caused by the large absorption red shift (100\u00a0nm) from UV\u2013vis region enabled the colormetric analysis of \u03b1-KA by naked-eye. Meanwhile, the large absorption red shift also contributed to the ratiometric detection, allowing for the accurate quantification of \u03b1-KA in complex biological sample. With this probe, ratiometric detection, naked eye mornitoring and imaging of \u03b1-KA in serum, living cells and tissues are realized for the first time.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Indomethacin ( Indo ) and naproxen ( Nap ) belong to Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) class II drugs, which permeate membranes well but are poorly soluble. Two pharmaceutical salts hydrate of  Indo  and  Nap  with (1R,2R)-1,2-diphenylethylenediamine ( DPEN ) were obtained using solution crystallization. Both salts,  (DPEN)   2   \u00b7(Indo)   2   \u00b7(H   2   O)   2   and  (DPEN)   1   \u00b7(Nap)   1   \u00b7(H   2   O)   0.5  , were characterised using various solid-state characterisation techniques such as single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Raman spectra. The structure analysis shows that  DPEN  is monocation as only one amine is protonated into ammonium. The  Indo ,  DPEN  and water molecules form one-dimensional hydrogen bond chains through extensive N H\u22efO, N H\u22efN and O H\u22efN interactions. The solubility study shows that the two salts are more soluble in pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 buffer mediums compared with pure raw materials. Solubility thermodynamics calculation was carried out to further understand the solubility properties of two salts.",

The chemisorption process involves dramatic atomic rearrangements in the crystalline state upon cleavage and formation of H-Cl, N-H, Cu-N, and Cu-Cl coordination and covalent bonds from the gas and solid state, respectively. Using mechanochemistry, the chloride-bridged coordination complex 1\u2033\u00b7MeOH is selectively produced by means of a dehydrochlorination reaction, but not in solution in which a mixture of 1\u00b7MeOH and 1\u2033\u00b7MeOH is obtained. 1\u2033\u00b7MeOH also via chemisorption and adsorption can trap HCl and MeOH to give the second sphere adduct 1'\u00b7MeOH. The adsorption process is confirmed by forming the second sphere adduct 1'\u00b7EtOH by exposing both 1\u00b7MeOH and 1\u2033\u00b7MeOH to HCl and ethanol. Quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations specific for solid phases give insights into the relative stabilities of the hybrid metal organic materials involved in the mechanochemical reaction producing selectively 1\u2033\u00b7MeOH, giving a good agreement with the experimental results.",

The interconversion between the stoichiometric variations of salts was investigated, in which the dynamic conversion can be obtained by adding one mole of one of the corresponding crystallizing components (A\u00b72H2O or B) upon grinding. Furthermore, the four diverse forms of salts follow transformations reversibly in the solid state.

        "abstract": "Impaired NK cell cytotoxic activity contributes to the local dysfunctional immune environment in endometriosis (EMS), which is an estrogen-dependent gynecological disease that affects the function of ectopic endometrial tissue clearance. The reason for the impaired cytotoxic activity of NK cells in an ectopic lesion microenvironment (ELM) is largely unknown. In this study, we show that the macroautophagy/autophagy level of endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) from EMS decreased under negative regulation of estrogen. The ratio of peritoneal FCGR3 NK to FCGR3 NK cells increases as EMS progresses. Moreover, the autophagy suppression results in the downregulation of HCK (hematopoietic cellular kinase) by inactivating STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), as well as the increased secretion of the downstream molecules CXCL8/IL8 and IL23A by ESCs, and this increase induced the upregulation of FCGR3 NK cells and decline of cytotoxic activity in ELM. This process is mediated through the depression of microRNA MIR1185-1-3p, which is associated with the activation of the target gene PTGS2 in NK cells. FCGR3 NK with a phenotype of PTGS2/COX2 IFNG PRF1 GZMB induced by hck knockout (hck) or 3-methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor)-stimulated ESCs accelerates ESC's growth both in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that the estrogen-autophagy-STAT3-HCK axis participates in the differentiation of PTGS2 IFNG PRF1 GZMB FCGR3 NK cells in ELM and contributes to the development of EMS. This result provides a scientific basis for potential therapeutic strategies to treat diseases related to impaired NK cell cytotoxic activity.",

Thus, novel antimicrobials against  infections are urgently needed. In the previous study, a cell wall hydrolase or lysin derived from Streptococcus prophage phi5218, termed Ply5218, was identified. This lysin showed strong bacteriolytic activity against . In the current study, the in vitro data showed that after incubation with pig serum, the bacteriolytic efficacy of Ply5218 declined in a time-dependent manner. The in vivo assays indicated that a Ply5218 triple treatment (6, 24, and 48 h post infection) was effective against various serotypes of  in a murine infection model. This regimen also alleviated streptococcal-induced clinical symptoms in piglets and significantly reduced the bacterial burden and levels of interleukin 6, a proinflammatory cytokine. This study indicates that Ply5218 shows strong antibacterial activity in pigs and has the potential to be used as a treatment for infectious diseases caused by .",

The crosstalk between decidual natural killer cells (dNK) and dM\u03a6 plays an important role in the maintenance of maternal-fetal immune tolerance. Here, CXCL16 derived from first-trimester trophoblast cells induces the polarization of human M2 macrophages. The M2 M\u03a6 polarized by CXCL16 exhibit decreased interleukin-15 production, which facilitates the inactivation of NK cells. The cytotoxicity of NK cells is attenuated by the CXCL16-polarized M2 M\u03a6. The data shown in the present study provide evidence to support the hypothesis that CXCL16 secreted by trophoblast cells is a key molecule involved in decidual M2 M\u03a6 polarization, which in turn regulates the killing ability of NK cells, thereby contributing to the homeostatic and immune-tolerant milieu required for successful fetal development.",

        "abstract": "Background  LAIR-1 can be triggered by collagen and its intracellular ITIMs are crucial for the inhibitory signal to NK cells. In order to investigate the regulation mechanisms of LAIR-1/collagen on NK cells, we aimed to construct LAIR-1 over-expressed NK-92 cells with which STATs related analysis was performed.  Methods  Lentivirus-mediated transfection was used to construct LAIR-1 over-expressed NK-92 cells. The expression of LAIR-1 in the constructed NK-92 cells was identified by QPCR and Western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence test was also used to observe the efficiency of lentivirus-mediated expression of LAIR-1 in NK-92 cells. The LAIR-1 over-expressed NK-92 cells were cultured in the IL-2 free medium for 48\u2009hours and then different concentrations of IL-2 were added into the culture system and the cells were collected after 30 mins. The expression of STAT1, p-STAT1, STAT4, and p-STAT4 were analysed by Western blot analysis.  Results  QPCR and Western blot analysis results showed the over-expressed LAIR-1 in NK-92 cells. Immunofluorescence result showed high efficiency of LAIR-1 lentiviral infection. Western blot results showed IL-2 could increase the phosphorylation of STAT1 in a dose-dependent manner, but not STAT4.  Conclusion  LAIR-1 over-expressed NK-92 cells were constructed successfully and the IL-2 treatment experiment showed different roles of STAT1 and STAT4 in the regulation of NK cells.

        "abstract": "With head-mounted displays becoming more and more ubiquitous, such headsets are bringing increasingly realistic and immersive experience to the individual users wearing the device. However, other people outside the virtual world are not able to feel or even observe the same vivid virtual environment as the user does. The strong demand of sharing virtual reality experiences among people are hence driving the development of mixed reality (MR) systems that merge real and virtual worlds into the same new environment. In the new world physical and virtual objects exist simultaneously and interact in real time. In this paper we propose Shared Augmented Virtual Environment (SAVE), a mixed reality system that overlays the virtual world with real world objects captured by a Kinect depth camera. We exploit image matting techniques to get the real world data from a green screen background. In the synthetic MR world both real and virtual objects are rendered in real time, where depths from both worlds are handled properly. The advantage of our system is that we connect the virtual and real worlds by a bridge controller mounted on the Kinect. Thereby, we only need to calibrate the whole system once before use. Our results demonstrate that the proposed SAVE system is able to create high quality 1080p live MR footage, enabling the realistic virtual reality experience to be shared among a large number of people at the same time. The proposed method could find potential applications in education, design, entertainment and so on.",

Our H-LF system consists of a array of cameras, with each camera sampling a different narrow band in the visible spectrum. There are two parts to extracting scene depth. The first part is our novel cross-spectral pairwise matching technique, which involves a new spectral-invariant feature descriptor and its companion matching metric we call bidirectional weighted normalized cross correlation (BWNCC). The second part, namely, H-LF stereo matching, uses a combination of spectral-dependent correspondence and defocus cues that rely on BWNCC. These two new cost terms are integrated into a Markov Random Field (MRF) for disparity estimation. Experiments on synthetic and real H-LF data show that our approach can produce high-quality disparity maps. We also show that these results can be used to produce the complete plenoptic cube in addition to synthesizing all-focus and defocused color images under different sensor spectral responses.",

The signal is multi-dimensional and has long relied on multi-modal sensing such as hybrid light field camera arrays. In this paper, we present a single camera hyperspectral light field imaging solution that we call Snapshot Plenoptic Imager (SPI). SPI uses spectral coded catadioptric mirror arrays for simultaneously acquiring the spatial, angular and spectral dimensions. We further apply a learning-based approach to improve the spectral resolution from very few measurements. Specifically, we demonstrate and then employ a new spectral sparsity prior that allows the hyperspectral profiles to be sparsely represented under a pre-trained dictionary. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real data show that our technique is effective, reliable, and accurate.

The optimum value for the momentum factor is obtained from the mean square error with respect to the gradient of synaptic weights in the proposed algorithm. The delta-bar-delta rule is employed as the learning rate adaptation method. The XOR and Wisconsin breast cancer (WBC) classification tasks are used to validate the proposed algorithms. Results demonstrate no error and a minimal error of 0.08 are achieved for the XOR and WBC classification tasks respectively, which are better than the original Booij\u2019s algorithm. The minimum number of epochs for XOR and Wisconsin breast cancer tasks are 35 and 26 respectively, which are also faster than the original Booij\u2019s algorithm \u2013 i.e. 135 (for XOR) and 97 (for WBC). Compared with the original algorithm with static momentum and learning rate, the proposed dynamic algorithms can control the convergence rate and learning performance more effectively.",

Due to its powerful non-linear computing ability, it has been applied to predict the time series. However, the parameters of the ESN need to be set experimentally, which can lead to instable performance and there is space to further improve its performance. In order to address this challenge, an improved fruit fly optimization algorithm (IFOA) is proposed in this work to optimize four key parameters of the ESN. Compared to the original fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA), the proposed IFOA improves the optimization efficiency, where two novel particles are proposed in the fruit flies swarm, and the search process of the swarm is transformed from two-dimensional to three-dimensional space. The proposed approach is applied to financial data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed FOA-ESN and IFOA-ESN models are more effective (~50% improvement) than others, and the IFOA-ESN can obtain the best prediction accuracy.",

In this work we tackle this problem by extending an established 2D method, Particle Imaging Velocimetry, to three dimensions by encoding depth into color. The encoding is achieved by illuminating the flow volume with a continuum of light planes (a \\\"rainbow\\\"), such that each depth corresponds to a specific wavelength of light. A diffractive component in the camera optics ensures that all planes are in focus simultaneously. With this setup, a single color camera is sufficient for tracking 3D trajectories of particles by combining 2D spatial and 1D color information. For reconstruction, we derive an image formation model for recovering stationary 3D particle positions. 3D velocity estimation is achieved with a variant of 3D optical flow that accounts for both physical constraints as well as the rainbow image formation model. We evaluate our method with both simulations and an experimental prototype setup.",

        "abstract": "Adaptive optics has become a valuable tool for correcting minor optical aberrations in applications such as astronomy and microscopy. However, due to the limited resolution of both the wavefront sensing and the wavefront correction hardware, it has so far not been feasible to use adaptive optics for correcting large-scale waveform deformations that occur naturally in regular photography and other imaging applications.\n\nIn this work, we demonstrate an adaptive optics system for regular cameras. We achieve a significant improvement in focus for large wavefront distortions by improving upon a recently developed high resolution coded wavefront sensor, and combining it with a spatial phase modulator to create a megapixel adaptive optics system with unprecedented capability to sense and correct large distortions.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Traditional snapshot hyperspectral imaging systems include various optical elements: a dispersive optical element (prism), a coded aperture, several relay lenses, and an imaging lens, resulting in an impractically large form factor. We seek an alternative, minimal form factor of snapshot spectral imaging based on recent advances in diffractive optical technology. We thereupon present a compact, diffraction-based snapshot hyperspectral imaging method, using only a novel diffractive optical element (DOE) in front of a conventional, bare image sensor. Our diffractive imaging method replaces the common optical elements in hyperspectral imaging with a single optical element. To this end, we tackle two main challenges: First, the traditional diffractive lenses are not suitable for color imaging under incoherent illumination due to severe chromatic aberration because the size of the point spread function (PSF) changes depending on the wavelength. By leveraging this wavelength-dependent property alternatively for hyperspectral imaging, we introduce a novel DOE design that generates an anisotropic shape of the spectrally-varying PSF. The PSF size remains virtually unchanged, but instead the PSF shape rotates as the wavelength of light changes. Second, since there is no dispersive element and no coded aperture mask, the ill-posedness of spectral reconstruction increases significantly. Thus, we propose an end-to-end network solution based on the unrolled architecture of an optimization procedure with a spatial-spectral prior, specifically designed for deconvolution-based spectral reconstruction. Finally, we demonstrate hyperspectral imaging with a fabricated DOE attached to a conventional DSLR sensor. Results show that our method compares well with other state-of-the-art hyperspectral imaging methods in terms of spectral accuracy and spatial resolution, while our compact, diffraction-based spectral imaging method uses only a single optical element on a bare image sensor.\n\n",

        "abstract": "In recent years, 3D Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) has become more and more attractive due to its ability to fully characterize various fluid flows. However, 3D fluid capture and velocity field reconstruction remain a challenging problem. A recent rainbow PIV system encodes depth into color and successfully recovers 3D particle trajectories, but it also suffers from a limited and fixed volume size, as well as a relatively low light efficiency. In this paper, we propose a reconfigurable rainbow PIV system that extends the volume size to a considerable range. We introduce a parallel double-grating system to improve the light efficiency for scalable rainbow generation. A varifocal encoded diffractive lens is designed to accommodate the size of the rainbow illumination, ranging from 15 mm to 50 mm. We also propose a truncated consensus ADMM algorithm to efficiently reconstruct particle locations. Our algorithm is 5x faster compared to the state-of-the-art. The reconstruction quality is also improved significantly for a series of density levels. Our method is demonstrated by both simulation and experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide is a widely distributed neurotransmitter that attenuates cocaine-induced locomotor activity when injected into the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Our previous work first confirmed that the inhibitory mechanism of the CART peptide on cocaine-induced locomotor activity is related to a reduction in cocaine-enhanced phosphorylated Ca /calmodulin-dependent protein kinaseII\u03b1 (pCaMKII\u03b1) and the enhancement of cocaine-induced D3R function. The present study investigated whether CART peptide inhibited cocaine-induced locomotor activity via inhibition of interactions between pCaMKII\u03b1 and the D3 dopamine receptor (D3R). We demonstrated that lentivirus-mediated gene transfer transiently increased pCaMKII\u03b1 expression, which peaked at 10 days after microinjection into the rat NAc shell, and induced a significant increase in Ca influx along with greater behavioral sensitivity in the open field test after intraperitoneal injections of cocaine (15 mg/kg). However, western blot analysis and coimmunoprecipitation demonstrated that CART peptide treatment in lentivirus-transfected CaMKII\u03b1-overexpressing NAc rat tissues or cells prior to cocaine administration inhibited the cocaine-induced Ca influx and attenuated the cocaine-increased pCaMKII\u03b1 expression in lentivirus-transfected CaMKII\u03b1-overexpressing cells. CART peptide decreased the cocaine-enhanced phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (pCREB) expression via inhibition of the pCaMKII\u03b1-D3R interaction, which may account for the prolonged locomotor sensitization induced by repeated cocaine treatment in lentivirus-transfected CaMKII\u03b1-overexpressing cells. These results provide strong evidence for the inhibitory modulation of CART peptide in cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

The cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide may possibly play an antioxidative role in neurons. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential antioxidant mechanism of CART peptide in a rat model of AD. We microinjected of A\u03b2 (2\u03bcl/4\u03bcg/hemisphere) into rat hippocampus to set a rat model of AD. A pre-microinjection of CART peptide (1\u03bcl/0.02\u03bcg/hemisphere) into rat hippocampus was administered for five consecutive days before A\u03b2 treatment. We found that A\u03b2 microinjection led to reduction of endogenous CART level in rat hippocampus. CART pretreatment improved the spatial memory and locomotor ability of AD rats. CART peptide decreased the A\u03b2 and A\u03b2 production-associated enzyme BACE1 levels. Moreover, CART peptide attenuated the oxidative stress damage with a concrete manifestation of increased MDA as well as decreased T-SOD, GSH and ATP levels in the hippocampus of A\u03b2-treated rat, which may be causatively implicated the activating of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. Furthermore, CART peptide attenuated neuronal apoptosis with decreased Bax, caspase-9 and caspase-3 levels and increased Bcl-2 level in rat hippocampus. Our results therefore indicate that CART peptide could serve as an antioxidant in early therapy for AD.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to characterize the inhibitory modulation of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptides, particularly with respect to the function of the D3 dopamine receptor (D3R), which is activated by its interaction with phosphorylated CaMKII\u03b1 (pCaMKII\u03b1) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). After repeated oral administration of caffeine (30 mg/kg) for five days, microinjection of CART peptide (0.08 \u03bcM/0.5 \u03bcl/hemisphere) into the NAc affected locomotor behavior. The pCaMKII\u03b1-D3R interaction, D3R phosphorylation and cAMP/PKA/phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) signaling pathway activity were measured in NAc tissues, and Ca2+ influx and pCaMKII\u03b1 levels were measured in cultured NAc neurons. We found that CART attenuated the caffeine-mediated enhancement of depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx and CaMKII\u03b1 phosphorylation in cultured NAc neurons. Repeated microinjection of CART peptides into the NAc decreased the caffeine-induced enhancement of Ca2+ channels activity, pCaMKII\u03b1 levels, the pCaMKII\u03b1-D3R interaction, D3R phosphorylation, cAMP levels, PKA activity and pCREB levels in the NAc. Furthermore, behavioral sensitization was observed in rats that received five-day administration of caffeine following microinjection of saline but not in rats that were treated with caffeine following microinjection of CART peptide. These results suggest that caffeine-induced CREB phosphorylation in the NAc was ameliorated by CART peptide due to its inhibition of D3R phosphorylation. These effects of CART peptides may play a compensatory role by inhibiting locomotor behavior in rats. ",

        "abstract": "The prohibitive cost of deploying a sophisticated DNS-based CDN makes anycast-based CDN an attractive alternative for new or small CDN operators. In anycast-based CDNs, user requests are naturally routed to the \u201cclosest\u201d server determined by Internet routing. For the operators, however, this comes at a cost\u2014 loss of control \u2014how the traffic is routed is entirely at the mercy of BGP routing. The \u201cclosest\u201d server may be overloaded, or simply not the best choice. This \u201closs of control\u201d undermines the  scalability  of anycast-based CDN architectures. To have control over how traffic is routed, existing work either requires adding a large amount of complexity to the system (high Capex/Opex) or is unable to achieve precise and fine-grained control. This paper proposes T-SAC, a scalable anycast-based CDN architecture that capitalizes on the programmability and flexibility of SDN/NFV, enabling fine-grained traffic redirection among CDN servers. T-SAC achieves precise control by leveraging a load-based redirection algorithm and a single 1-bit no-redirect flag. We implement T-SAC in the real system and evaluate its performance from various aspects using DASH and web applications. The results show that T-SAC is capable of redirecting the right amount of traffic at the right time to the right servers, making the system highly scalable.",

        "abstract": "It is well known that there is a fundamental tradeoff among the breakdown voltage (including BVCBO and BVceo), the cutoff frequency (fT), and the current gain (\u03b2) for standard collector SiGe HBTs. In order to enhance the breakdown voltage at a fixed fT and \u03b2, the superjunction collector design is proposed and the model of NPN SiGe HBT with a superjunction P-type doping layer inside the collector-base (CB) space charge region (SCR) is established with SILVACO TCAD. It is shown that the inserted P-type layer provides a reverse electric field to change electric field distribution, reduce the peak ionization coefficient, and hence enhance the breakdown voltage with a slight decrease off and \u03b2. Furthermore, a novel composite of double P-type layers inside the CB SCR is proposed for further improvement of the breakdown voltage at a minor expense of fT and \u03b2 It is shown that SiGe HBT with double P-type layers has the lowest peak electric field, the lowest peak ionization coefficient and consequently the highest breakdown voltage when compared with standard collector and one P-type layer collector SiGe HBTs. As a result, the figure of merit fT\u00d7BVCEO\u00d7\u03b2 is improved from 65945GHz-V to 83729GHz-V, which effectively develops the high frequency and high power application of SiGe HBTs.",

        "abstract": "The product of the cutoff frequency and breakdown voltage (fT\u00d7BVCEO) is an important figure of merit (FOM) to characterize overall performance of heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT). In this paper, an approach to introducing a thin N+-buried layer into N collector region in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) SiGe HBT to simultaneously improve the FOM of fT\u00d7BVCEO and thermal stability is presented by using two-dimensional (2D) numerical simulation through SILVACO device simulator. Firstly, in order to show some disadvantages of the introduction of SOI structure, the effects of SOI insulation layer thickness (TBOX) on fT, BVCEO, and the FOM of fT\u00d7BVCEO are presented. The introduction of SOI structure remarkably reduces the electron concentration in collector region near SOI substrate insulation layer, obviously reduces fT, slightly increases BVCEO to some extent, but ultimately degrades the FOM of fT\u00d7BVCEO. Although the fT, BVCEO, and the FOM of fT\u00d7BVCEO can be improved by increasing SOI insulator SiO2 layer thickness TBOX in SOI structure, the device temperature and collector current are increased due to lower thermal conductivity of SiO2 layer, as a result, the self-heating effect of the device is enhanced, and the thermal stability of the device is degraded. Secondly, in order to alleviate the foregoing problem of low electron concentration in collector region near SOI insulation layer and the thermal stability resulting from thick TBOX, a thin N+-buried layer is introduced into collector region to not only improve the FOM of fT\u00d7BVCEO, but also weaken the self-heating effect of the device, thus improving the thermal stability of the device. Furthermore, the effect of the location of the thin N+-buried layer in collector region is investigated in detail. The result show that the FOM of fT\u00d7BVCEO is improved and the device temperature decreases as the N+-buried layer shifts toward SOI substrate insulation layer. The approach to introducing a thin N+-buried layer into collector region provides an effective method to improve SOI SiGe HBT overall performance.",

The simulation results show that for AI operated under fixed current density JC, the HBT lateral structure parameters have significant effect on Ls but little influence on Q and \u03c90, and the larger Ls can be realized by the narrow, short emitter stripe and few emitter stripes of SiGe HBTs. On the other hand, for AI with fixed HBT size, smaller JC is beneficial for AI to obtain larger Ls, but with a cost of smaller Q and \u03c90. In addition, under the fixed collector current IC, the larger the size of HBT is, the larger Ls becomes, but the smaller Q and \u03c90 become.

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous \u223c22 nt noncoding RNAs that control the translation initiation and stability of target genes in a sequence-specific manner and, thus, play important regulatory roles in animals and plants. Homologs of Dom34, called Pelota or PELO, are broadly conserved in eukaryotes and archaea. Biochemical and genetic studies indicate that eukaryotic Dom34/Pelota plays an important role in cell division, differentiation of germline stem cells, and stem cell self-renewal by controlling the expression of specific genes at the translational level. Additionally, it is reported that Pelota is specifically required for high efficiency synthesis of proteins in numerous viruses. In earlier studies, we found the Bos taurus bta-miR-2411 (shortly miR-2411 herein) was significantly upregulated by more than 2.1 times in bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) strain NADL-infected Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells after 8\u202fh post-infection (pi) compared to normal MDBK cells without BVDV infection. Moreover, miR-2411 overexpression significantly reduced the BVDV E1 mRNA level and viral titer. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of miR-2411 attenuating on viral replication remain unclear. Here, we report that miR-2411 as a novel microRNA regulates BVDV NADL replication via directly targeting the Pelota gene in MDBK cells. We investigated whether the potential target sequences of miR-2411, located in the Pelota 3'UTR, and miR-2411 agomir transfection attenuated Pelota mRNA and protein levels. Indeed, upon miR-2411 overexpression, BVDV NADL replication was prevented. Importantly, BVDV NADL replication levels were reversed to normal levels as a result of the Pelota rescuing experiment even though miR-2411 was existent. Overall, we profiled the unique role of miR-2411 in regulating BVDV NADL replication and provided a novel strategy for generalized inhibition of viral infection.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an important class of small, non-coding RNAs that control target genes expression by degradation of target mRNAs or by inhibiting protein translation in many biological processes and cellular pathways. In a previous study, we found that miR-29b interfered with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) replication. However, the mechanisms of regulation of miR-29b expression are not well known. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism for silencing gene transcription, and plays an important role in promoter choice, protein expression, and regulation of miRNAs expression. In this study, we focused on the roles of DNA methylation of miR-29b promoter in regulating miR-29b expression and investigated the effects of DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) knockdown on miR-29b expression and BVDV (strain NADL) replication. Our results showed that methylation levels of miR-29b promoter were significantly decreased in BVDV NADL-infected MDBK cells. Furthermore, DNMT1 silencing significantly decreased the methylation levels of miR-29b promoter, up-regulated miR-29b expression and inhibited BVDV NADL replication, which supports the important roles of DNA methylation in regulating miRNA expression and further proves an evidence for our previous views.",

        "abstract": "Infections with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) contribute significantly to health-related economic losses in the beef and dairy industries and are widespread throughout the world. Severe acute BVDV infection is characterized by a gastrointestinal (GI) inflammatory response. The mechanism of inflammatory lesions caused by BVDV remains unknown. The interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) network plays a pivotal role as a pacemaker in the generation of electrical slow waves for GI motility, and it is crucial for the reception of regulatory inputs from the enteric nervous system. The present study investigated whether ICC were a good model for studying GI inflammatory lesions caused by BVDV infection. Primary ICC were isolated from the duodenum of Merino sheep. The presence of BVDV was detected in ICC grown for five passages after BVDV infection, indicating that BVDV successfully replicated in ICC. After infection with BVDV strain TC, the cell proliferation proceeded slowly or declined. Morphological changes, including swelling, dissolution, and formation of vacuoles in the ICC were observed, indicating quantitative, morphological and functional changes in the cells. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed to investigate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in BVDV-infected ICC and explore the molecular mechanism of underlying quantitative, morphological and functional changes of ICC. Eight hundred six genes were differentially expressed after BVDV infection, of which 538 genes were upregulated and 268 genes were downregulated. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses showed that the 806 DEGs were significantly enriched in 27 pathways, including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, interleukin (IL)-17 signaling and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. The DEGs and raw files of high-throughput sequencing of this study were submitted to the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession number GSE122344). Finally, 21 DEGs were randomly selected, and the relative repression levels of these genes were tested using the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to validate the RNA-Seq results. The results showed that the related expression levels of 21 DEGs were similar to RNA-Seq. This study is the first to establish a new infection model for investigating GI inflammatory lesions induced by BVDV infection. RNA-Seq-based transcriptomic profiling can provide a basis for study on BVDV-associated inflammatory lesions.",

        "abstract": "Long non-coding RNA urothelial carcinoma associated 1 (lncRNA UCA1) promotes cancer progression and enhances chemoresistance through miR-204-5p in a few cancers. However, no studies have investigated whether UCA1 regulates glioma metastasis through miR-204-5p and its target. In the present study, cell migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were evaluated in glioma cells overexpressing UCA1. The relationships among UCA1, miR-204-5p and ZEB1 were examined by real-time PCR, western blotting and dual-luciferase reporter assays. The effect of UCA1 knockdown on xenograft tumor growth was investigated. The levels of miR-204-5p, fibronectin, COL5\u2009A1 and ZEB1 in tumor tissues were also determined. The results showed that UCA1 overexpression promoted cell migration, invasion and EMT. UCA1 interacted with miR-204-5p and decreased its level. ZEB1 was identified as a direct target of miR-204-5p and miR-204-5p negatively regulated ZEB1 expression. Moreover, UCA1 sponged miR-204-5p and partially rescued the inhibitory effect of miR-204-5p on ZEB1. In our in vivo studies, UCA1 knockdown reduced tumor volume and tumor weight. In addition, the levels of fibronectin, COL5\u2009A1 and ZEB1 were decreased, while miR-204-5p level was increased. The present study provides the first evidence that UCA1 promotes glioma metastasis through the miR-204-5p/ZEB1 axis, contributing to the understanding of the pathogenesis of glioma.",

In this study, primary cortical neurons and the SH-SY5Y cell line were used to investigate the role of BMP-7 and its downstream signals in the neuroprotective effects of oxygen-glucose deprivation preconditioning (OGDPC). Immunocytochemistry was used to detect the expression of neurofilament in neurons. MTT and lactate dehydrogenase activity assays were used to measure the cytotoxicity. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression of BMP-7 and downstream signals. BMP inhibitor, mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors, Smad inhibitor and siRNA of Smad 1 were used to investigate the role of corresponding signalling pathways in the OGDPC. Results showed that OGDPC-induced overexpression of BMP-7 in primary cortical neurons and SH-SY5Y cells. Both of endogenous and exogenous BMP-7 could replicate the neuroprotective effects seen in OGDPC pretreatment. In addition, extracellular regulated protein kinases, p38 and Smad signalling pathway were found to be involved in the neuroprotective effects mediated by OGDPC via BMP-7. This study primarily reveals the cellular mechanisms of the neuroprotection mediated by OGDPC, and provides evidence for better understanding of this intrinsic factor against ischemia. ",

Osthole is a coumarin derivative extracted from the fruits of Cnidium monnieri (L.) Cusson. In this study, we established a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) in vivo and found that MCAO/R caused cerebral infarction, hippocampus neuronal injury and apoptosis, and also activated the Notch 1 signaling pathway. However, treatment with osthole further enhanced the activity of Notch 1 signaling and reduced the cerebral infarction as well as the hippocampus neuronal injury and apoptosis induced by MCAO/R in a dose-dependent manner. The same results were observed in a primary neuronal oxygen glucose deficiency/reperfusion (OGD/R) model in vitro, and the effect of osthole could be blocked by an inhibitor of Notch 1 signaling, N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S...",

        "abstract": "Aortic pulse wave reflects cardiovascular status, but, unlike the peripheral pulse wave, is difficult to be measured reliably using noninvasive techniques. Thus, the estimation of aortic pulse wave from peripheral ones is of great significance. This study proposed an adaptive transfer function (ATF) method to estimate the aortic pulse wave from the brachial pulse wave. Aortic and brachial pulse waves were derived from 26 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization. Generalized transfer functions (GTF) were derived based on the autoregressive exogenous model. Then, the GTF was adapted by its peak resonance frequency. And the optional peak resonance frequency for an individual was determined by regression formulas using brachial systolic blood pressure. The method was validated using the leave-one-out cross validation method. Compared with previous studies, the ATF method showed better performance in estimating the aortic pulse wave and predicting the feature parameters. The prediction error of the aortic systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure were 0.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.1 and -0.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.1\u00a0mmHg, respectively. The percentage errors of augmentation index, percentage notch amplitude, and ejection duration were -2.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a032.7%, 12.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.2%, and -2.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The safety production is the most important index for nuclear power development, and the CVCS (chemical and volume control system) occupies an important place in safety control system. The CCP (centrifugal charging pump) is an important component of CVCS system and its particularity decides the high requirements on the cavitation performance, so the research on CCP cavitation has great significance. Using the 3D Pro/E software, the paper makes models of the flow passage components of first stage prototype of CCP in nuclear power stations, and completes the cavitation steady-state computation in the case that the high flow rate of first stage prototype reaches  Q \u00a0=\u00a0160\u00a0m 3 /h using the numerical computation software ANSYS CFX. The cavitation is divided into the following five stages according to its development process: inception operating condition, development operating condition, critical operating condition, serious operating condition and fracture operating condition. The research analyze the flow field, static pressure fields and bubble distribution conditions in the impeller in different cavitation states, and selects the middle flow line, the front shroud flow line and the back shroud flow line from the same blade for the comparative analysis; to verify the reliability of computation, the researcher made a first stage cavitation prototype to verify its hydraulic performance and cavitation performance. After the comparative analysis on the flow field, pressure and bubble distribution conditions of CCP first stage impeller in different cavitation states, the research draws the following conclusions: (1) as the inlet pressure decreases, the cavitation degree increases, the bubble distribution area extends from impeller inlet to impeller outlet and shows different laws in different cavitation states; (2) the generation of cavitation is affected by the pressure changes in impeller passages, and when the inlet pressure decreases, the static pressure in impeller passage decreases, thus producing a local low-pressure area; (3) the comparison of computation and test results shows small errors, thus proving the accuracy of analog computation; besides, the research verifies the cavitation performance in different flow rates by test, and test results show that NPSH 3  is smaller than the 7.8\u00a0m stipulated in  Technical Specifications  in any flow rate condition, indicating that the design is reasonable. The research points out a direction for the further improvement of optimization design of CCP cavitation performance.",

In this article, both numerical and experimental methods are used to carry out this research work. The effects under the steady gas volume fraction state and the transient gas quantity variation process on the mixed-flow pump are investigated and compared in detail. It could be concluded that the head of the mixed-flow pump shows slight decline at the low gas volume fraction state, while it decreases sharply at the high gas volume fraction state and then decreases with the increasing gas quantity. There is an obvious asymmetric blade vapor density on the blade suction side under each cavitation state. The cavities can be weakened obviously by increasing the inlet gas volume fraction within a certain range. It has little influence on the internal unsteady flow of the mixed-flow pump when the gas volume fraction is less than 10%, but the pump starts to operate with a great unsteady characteri...",

The results show that the maximum critical negative pressure calculated by liquid water with dissolved oxygen molecules is \u2212165\u2005MPa \u223c \u2212170\u2005MPa, and the magnitude of bubble nucleation rate is 35.

The notions of SVBR and lead-bismuth eutectic alloy coolant put forward by Russia were well received by the international nuclear science community. Lead-bismuth eutectic alloy with the ability of the better neutron economy, the low melting point, the high boiling point, the chemical inertness to water and air and other features, which was considered the most promising coolant for the 4th generation nuclear reactors. This study mainly focuses on the structural design optimization of the 4th-generation reactor coolant pump, including analysis of external characteristics, inner flow, and transient characteristic. It was found that: the reactor coolant pump with a central symmetrical dual-outlet volute structure has better radial-direction balance, the pump without guide vane has better hydraulic performance, and the pump with guide vanes has worse torsional vibration and pressure pulsation. This study serves as experience accumulation and technical support for the development of the 4th generation nuclear energy system.",

To remedy the shortcomings of the traditional complete-characteristic expression with regards to only describing limited flow sections at specific revolving speeds, the paper proposes a normalization method. As an important boundary condition of the security computing of unstable transient process of the primary reactor coolant pump and the nuclear island primary circuit and secondary circuit, the precision of complete-characteristic data and curve impacts the precision of security computing. A normalization curve obtained by applying the normalization method to process complete-characteristic data could correctly, completely and precisely express the complete characteristics of the primary reactor coolant pump under any rotational speed and full flow, and is capable of giving proper estimations on external characteristics of the flow outside the test range and even of the infinite flow. These advantages are of great significance for the improvement of security computing of transient processes of the primary reactor coolant pump and the circuit system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The coasting characteristic of the reactor coolant pump is one of the important indicators for the safe operation of the nuclear power system. Coasting transition process of the reactor coolant pump under the working condition of power failure belongs to transient flow process. For most of the time of the coasting transition process, the parameters of flow rate, speed and head of reactor coolant pump are nonlinear. It is very difficult to study the changing law of coasting. This paper studies the energy conversion process in the coasting transition process of reactor coolant pump under accident conditions to build a comprehensive test bench for a hydraulic prototype and complete the external characteristic test and coasting transient process test of the reactor coolant pump. We find the results through coasting test: Diverting guide vane obviously improves the flow pattern (the various forms of fluid movement) larger flow conditions, reduces the flow loss, improves the energy utilization, improves the head and efficiency obviously, and prolongs the coasting time of the flow rate is reduced to the flow rate of the reactor coolant pump, makes the core of nuclear reactor obtain more sufficient coolant flow.",

Under cavitating conditions the flow patterns in the pump are complex and highly turbulent flow can be induced. In this paper the flow characteristics in the impeller passage of a nuclear centrifugal pump model were systematically investigated under steady and transient cavitation conditions. At moderate cavitation levels the results show that the fluctuations of the radial force on the impeller are mainly affected by rotor-stator interaction effects, but are strongly influenced by cavitation under developed cavitation conditions. At inception vapor is mainly generated near the leading edge of the blade, and spreads on the suction side of the impeller at higher cavitation levels. The vapor generation, development and burst under transient cavitation conditions have a strong influence on the flow patterns in the impeller passage. The trends of the simulations are in accordance with the measured results, thus confirming the validity of the numerical model used for predicting the characteristics of the flow through the impeller.",

With silica gel as adsorbent, the feed gas (15% CO 2 /85% N 2 ) was separated at 299.65\u00a0K and 200\u00a0kPa by the DR PSA process. Adsorption isotherms of CO 2  and N 2  on silica gel were measured and fitted by the extended Langmuir model. The process was then simulated with a commercial software, Aspen Adsorption. The simulation results revealed that feed position, method of equalizing-pressure and light component reflux flow rate would affect the performance in terms of purity and recovery significantly. The efficiency and feasibility of the DR PSA process were evaluated by the experiment and results showed that 99.62% of CO 2  could be recovered with purity of 99.18% via DR PSA process meanwhile light product N 2  could be enriched to 99.64% with recovery of 99.56% under optimal operating conditions. Overall, the DR PSA process is promising for separating a N 2 /CO 2  mixture and producing gases with a high purity and recovery efficiency.",

The encouraged approach is thermal oxidation to process the vent gas by the clean development mechanism (CDM). Though such an approach could avoid the adverse environmental impacts, it will result in a great economic loss that includes not only the incineration cost but also the waste resource of R23. R23 is valuable as a refrigerant, fire suppression agent, and plasma etchant (purity: 99.999 mol %). In this work, the distillation-pressure swing adsorption (DIST-PSA) process was employed to concentrate R23 from 88% to 99.999% in the vent gas economically. Dynamic breakthrough experiments were performed to predict the adsorbent separation performance. Results indicated the coconut activated carbon (SAC-1) is appropriate material for R23 and R22 separation.

Prior to performing a sequential separation VPSA process design, the statical adsorption equilibrium isotherms of pure CH4, CO, CO2, H2, and N2 on two dissimilar improved copper-supported adsorbents of Cu(I)AC and Cu(I)Y were first determined under four different temperature values (293.15, 303.15, 313.15, and 323.15 K) with pressures up to 500 kPa. The experimental adsorption equilibrium data of the pure component were then proved to be well fitted by a Langmuir isotherm model.

The adsorption equilibrium of C 8  aromatic isomers and  p -diethylbenzene on the commercial adsorbent were determined experimentally, while the lumped mass transfer coefficients were estimated through pulse experimental results. A generic mathematic model incorporating the fixed model, node model as well as dead volume model was developed to implement a numerical simulation of an industrial-scale  p -xylene simulated moving bed process. Moreover, the accuracy of mathematic model was validated by industrial data. Furthermore, a dynamic optimization framework, with state of the art Sequential Quadratic programming optimization algorithm, was firstly proposed to obtain the optimal operating conditions for an existing industrial simulated moving bed unit. Optimization results reflect that the desorbent consumption of  p -diethylbenzene was favorable to be selected as objective function to be minimized, which could achieve 3.12% increase in SMB unit productivity and 8.66% decrease in desorbent consumption for seven zone  p -xylene simulated moving bed process. Two-level optimization procedure was also constructed to get the maximum feed throughput with a desired minimized desorbent consumption. Under the optimal operating conditions, the productivity increases by 16.63% while the PDEB consumption decreases by 18.85% for seven zone  p -xylene simulated moving bed process. Eight zone  p -xylene simulated moving bed process as\u00a0a new operating mode, which was also analyzed, emulated and optimized through numerical calculation. Results show that the eight zone operation could achieve a much higher productivity and the desorbent consumption of  p -diethylbenzene was almost the same in comparison with seven zone operation.",

To achieve a favorable carbon capture performance, parameter study was implemented to obtain a series of optimized settings of process operating variables by investigating the effects of flowrate of light product reflux, flowrate of heavy product and feed inlet position on the separation performance in terms of product purity, product recovery, and adsorbent productivity, as well as specific power-consumption. Under the optimal manipulation parameter configuration, a high-purity CO 2  product with a concentration of 95.55% and a higher CO 2  product recovery of 96.81% with a competitive specific power consumption of 110.58\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol \u22121 CO 2  can be obtained. This finding demonstrated an efficient and economical method in the field of carbon capture and storage. In addition, a good consistency between simulation results and experimental data confirmed the reliability of the mathematical model of dual-reflux pressure swing adsorption process, and the dynamic distribution behaviors of pressure, temperature and gas-solid concentration were obtained from the simulation results to illuminate and validate the process separation performance in depth under different operating conditions.",

Notably, a ten-bed PSA process with activated carbon and 5A zeolite was designed to produce 99.99+% H 2  with over 85% recovery from the SMR gas (CH 4 /CO/CO 2 /H 2 \u00a0=\u00a03.5/0.5/20/76\u00a0vol%). Moreover, a three-bed VSA system was constructed to recover CO 2  from the tail gas using silica gel as the adsorbent. CO 2  product with 95% purity and over 90% recovery could be attained. Additionally, the effects of various operating parameters on the process performances were investigated in detail.",

        "abstract": "The recovery of methane from oxygen-bearing coal bed methane (CBM) (25% CH4/65% N2/10% O2) by vacuum pressure swing adsorption (VPSA) was studied systematically in this work. Nevertheless, it is difficult to implement systematic safety investigations of the process just by bench-scale experiments and pilot plants. Emphasis was placed on the construction of a new way to analyze process safety based on a developed explosive triangle theory that could be able to provide guidance for comprehensive safety evaluation in the VPSA process for upgrading of oxygen-bearing CBM. The simulation results revealed that a two-column seven-step VPSA process not only could generate 50.40% CH4 purity with 86.3% product recovery but also could achieve higher product productivity of 1.494 (mol of CH4)\u00b7kgads\u20131\u00b7h\u20131 and lower energy consumption of 0.179 kWh\u00b7Nm\u20133 feed as well.

Due to its complexity and periodic operation, calculation of the optimal PSA system that simultaneously obtains process design and control decision variables is a complicated task. This work presents detailed design and control optimization study of a two-bed, six-step PSA system aimed at heavy component CH 4  upgrading. The key optimization objective is to enhance product CH 4  recovery while achieving a closed loop product CH 4  purity of 75% for separating 68%N 2 /32%CH 4  feed under external disturbances. Traditional sequential and simultaneously design and control approach are employed and compared based on this purpose. The benefits of simultaneous methodology over conventional sequential approach are successfully demonstrated by closed-loop performance results and simulation profiles. The simultaneously design and control methodology has succeeded in synthesizing the optimal PSA cycle which can generate CH 4  recovery as high as 97.30%.",

        "abstract": "The separation and recovery of the greenhouse gases CHF3 and CHClF2 from emissions is essential to avoid adverse environmental effects. Nanoporous carbons are excellent candidates for the capture of CHF3. However, little research has been done on the effect of pore size on the adsorption capacity and selectivity of CHClF2 over CHF3 in nanoporous carbon materials. The effect of the pore size on the competitive adsorption of a binary CHF3\u2013CHClF2 mixture in graphitic slit pores has been investigated using a combination of Monte Carlo simulations and breakthrough curve experiments over a wide range of pressures and temperatures. The entropy changes have a considerable effect on selectivity of CHClF2 over CHF3 because the size of the adsorbate molecule is close to the effective height of the pores; conversely, adsorption energy has a significant impact. The selectivity of CHClF2 over CHF3 at 0.05\u20131.0 MPa increases in the order 19.47 u003c 16.62 u003c 13.20 u003c 11.77 u003c 8.30 u003c 5.17 u003c 5.67 A. The mechanisms for adsorption ...",

In this work, adsorption equilibrium isotherms of pure oxygen and nitrogen on LiLSX zeolite were firstly measured and fitted with the extended Langmuir model in order to describe the behavior of the static adsorption. A total of sixteen experiments were carried out on a laboratory scale DR-PSA apparatus for verifying the reliability of the mathematical model. Finally, an optimal operating condition was obtained by comparing the purity and recovery of products under different experimental conditions. Results revealed that feed or light reflux time (t FE/LR ), heavy reflux flow rate (Q HR ), vacuum pressure (P L ) and feed flow rate (Q F ) all had significant effects on the process performance. O 2  in light product could be enriched to 99.1% with recovery of 98.0% while N 2  in heavy product is 99.0% in concentration with recovery of 99.3% under the optimal experimental condition.

In this paper, the Grand Canonical Monte Carlo was used to simulate the adsorption performance of activated carbon on VOCs (benzene, toluene, acetone and methanol). After simulating different pore sizes (0.902\u202fnm,1.997\u202fnm,3\u202fnm and 4\u202fnm) adsorption performances of activated carbon, activated carbon with a pore size of 1.997\u202fnm was selected to further study the influence of functional groups (carboxyl, amino, hydroxyl and hydrogen), and the capillary condensation was explained by the Kelvin equation. Furthermore, effects of functional groups under saturated vapor pressure (P) of VOCs that range from 0 to 0.1 P were explained by the accessible volume and intermolecular interaction potential, respectively. Under pressure range of 0-0.1 P, at the beginning of adsorption of acetone and methanol, carboxyl and amino groups could reduce the threshold pressure while hydroxyl and hydrogen have the opposite effect. For benzene and toluene, all functional groups have little effect on the threshold pressure, and they reduce the adsorption capacity instead. It could be concluded that the activated carbon could achieve the best adsorption effect on acetone and methanol, on the contrary, the addition of functional groups on benzene and toluene will weaken their adsorption performance.",

Results show that the stress relaxation of CA mortar can be divided into two parts: the attenuation stress relaxation stage and stable stress relaxation stage. With the increasing strain levels, the relaxed stress, stress relaxation rate, stress relaxation modulus and specific stress relaxation of CA mortar increase gradually. Under the same initial strain level, the relaxed stress of type I CA mortar and type II CA mortar are little different, whereas the specific stress relaxation of type I CA mortar is much greater than that of type II CA mortar. In the strain range of 0.32\u20130.80%, the isochronous stress-strain relation of type I CA mortar is linear. When the strain is greater than 0.80%, the isochronous stress-strain relationship concaves to the strain axis gradually. The isochronous stress-strain relationship of type II CA mortar show linear increase in the strain range of 0.47\u20131.42%. A stress relaxation model based on thermodynamic theory was established, which agrees very well with the experimental results.",

In this paper, DMTA of cement and asphalt mortar (CA mortar) with different asphalt to cement ratios (A/C) and water to cement ratios (W/C) was performed within a temperature range of \u2212\u00a040 to 60\u00a0\u00b0C. The results demonstrate that the storage modulus  E \u2032 gradually decreases with increasing temperature. At the same temperature,  E \u2032 decreases with the increase of A/C and W/C, with the decreasing trend becoming gradually more pronounced. The loss modulus  E \u2033 of CA mortar increases initially but subsequently decreases with an increase in temperature.  E \u2033 gradually increases with an increase in A/C and W/C at the same temperature, though the increasing trend with W/C is less pronounced. The variation of the loss factor tan \u03b4  is similar to that of  E \u2033, and the temperature corresponding to the peak points of tan \u03b4  is slightly higher than that of  E \u2033.",

The strain rate effects on the compressive strength, elastic modulus, peak strain and specific energy absorption were obtained. The results showed that the compressive strength and specific energy absorption increased with increasing strain rate, whose strain rate sensitivity for CAI was stronger than that for CAII. The strain rate sensitivity of the elastic modulus and peak strain scattered. Under similarly high strain rates, the compressive strength, elastic modulus, peak strain and specific energy absorption of CAII were larger than those of CAI. A statistical continuous damage constitutive model involving the strain rate for CA mortar was proposed based on the theory of thermodynamics and statistical damage mechanics.

The present paper designed a freeze and flexural-loading coupling action testing system to investigate the mechanical characteristics of self-compacting concrete applied in filling layer (FLSCC), aiming at understanding the service behavior of filling layer under severe environment condition. The effects of temperature, cycle number and stress level on mechanical properties including flexural strength, dynamic elastic modulus and damping ratio of FLSCC were discussed. Results show that the freeze and cyclic load coupling action aggravates the deterioration of concrete compared to single cyclic load condition. FLSCC exhibits better resistance to freeze and cyclic load action than other three investigated concretes in term of flexural strength, dynamic elastic modulus and damping ratio. The flexural strength of FLSCC decreases with increasing cycle number stress level at low temperature (\u221220\u202f\u00b0C) and the damage variable of FLSCC increases exponentially with cycle number. The outstanding resistance of FLSCC to freeze and cyclic load coupling action results from the excellent microstructure which can maintain its good deformation capacity and delay the damage propagation.",

The strain-rate effect of the dynamic compressive strength, dynamic elastic modulus, critical strain, specific energy absorption and characteristic length of HBPRC was analyzed in detail. The results showed that all mechanical indices of HBPRC increased with increasing strain rate. The dynamic increase factor of compressive strength and elastic modulus increased linearly with the decimal logarithm of strain rate, and the critical strain and characteristic length increased linearly with strain rate. The addition of basalt fiber (BF) and polypropylene fiber (PF) yielded a significant increase in the strain-rate sensitivity of dynamic mechanical behaviour of HBPRC, while PF had a more significant effect compared to BF. Hybridization of BF and PF resulted in various influences on the strain-rate sensitivity of dynamic mechanical behaviour of HBPRC, but there was a significant positive correlation between the hybrid content of fibers and the strain-rate sensitivity of dynamic mechanical behaviour of HBPRC. The variation in specific energy absorption and characteristic length with strain rate and fiber content was consistent, and both could characterise the impact toughness of HBPRC.",

A 77-year-old steel mill was inspected, and 35 concrete column cover samples were collected to test the pH of the pore solution and phase compositions layer by layer. The variation in pH and phase compositions of the concrete along the cover depth was studied. The in-situ inspection results indicate that the rebar embedded in concrete had begun to corrode when the carbonation depth was almost less than one-third of the cover depth. The corrosion initiation of rebars embedded in concrete can occur when the pH is between 11.3 and 12.1. The pore solution pH test results and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicated that there is a semi-carbonated zone between the fully carbonated zone and the rebar. The pH of a fully carbonated zone is in a range of 8.0\u20139.5, and the pH of a semi-carbonated zone is between 9.5 and 12.1.",

The results showed that the addition of basalt fibre (BF) and polypropylene fibre (PF) is effective at improving the impact-resistance behaviour of concrete. The dynamic compressive strength, critical strain, and energy absorption capacity of BPFRC increased with increasing strain rate. At strain rates of 20\u2013140\u00a0s \u22121 , the addition of BF and PF significantly increased the dynamic compressive strength, critical strain, and energy absorption capacity of concrete. The dynamic increase factor of BPFRC increased linearly with the decimal logarithm of strain rate. The hybrid addition of BF and PF significantly improved the strain rate effect of the dynamic compressive strength. The strengthening and toughening mechanisms of BF and PF are discussed in detail. The proposed dynamic damage constitutive model can be used to accurately describe the dynamic stress\u2013strain relationship of BPFRC.",

The addition of basalt fibre (BF) and polypropylene fibre (PF) yielded significant increases in the strain rate effect of the dynamic compressive strength and dynamic elastic modulus of concrete and improved the deformation capacity of concrete. The influence of PF on the strain rate effect of dynamic compressive strength of concrete was greater than that of BF. However, there was no clear difference between the influences of BF and PF on the strain rate effect of the dynamic elastic modulus of concrete. There was a significant positive correlation between the hybrid volume of fibre and the strain rate effect of the dynamic compressive mechanical behaviour of BPFRC.

Grain production in Heilongjiang Province has increased consecutively every year since 2003, and numerous water and land resource-related problems have become increasingly prominent and have had significant adverse effects on social and economic development and stability in the region.  In this study, Heilongjiang Province and its 13 prefecture-level cities were selected as the study area, and the degrees of coordination of the social, economic and ecological subsystems were evaluated using periphery theory and the theory of synergetics.  To ensure that the assessment was objective and accurate, weights were calculated using the projection pursuit technique, and similarity degrees were calculated using a modified (by introducing the chi-square distance) order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) technique.  Moreover, to reflect the variations in the overall degree of coordination in Heilongjiang Province, the risk level of the coordination of the water and land resource system was predicted through the year 2020 using a dynamic neural network.  This study provides a reference for establishing effective and balanced coordination between society and water and land resources.Keywords: water and land resources, periphery theory, coordination, particle swarm optimization, neural networkDOI: 10.25165/j.ijabe.20181103.3508Citation: Jiang Q X, Zhou Z M, Wang Z L, Fu Q, Zhao Y Z, Wang T.

The host\u2013guest assembly is constructed through interactions between host and guest molecules (CD\u2013Al2O3 NPs act as the host, and HEMA\u2013Ad acts as the guest). The characterization results of the materials show that there are two kinds of supramolecular interactions, namely, the host\u2013guest interaction and the hydrogen bonding. The material possesses good thermal stability (heat-resisting temperature can reach 200 \u00b0C) and good electrical performance. The storage modulus of the material can be increased up to 432 MPa using a cross-linking agent at 20 \u00b0C. Furthermore, the material exhibits self-healing property, and it can self-heal several times; its self-healing efficiency is relative to the dosage of the cross-linking agent.",

At present, the aging (life assessment) of transformers are mainly conducted based upon the degree of polymerization, concentration of furfural, and the gas analysis of CO and CO2 in the transformer oil. However, these techniques lack sensitive response, especially in the early aging of oil-paper insulation. Methanol as a new indicator to evaluate the aging of insulating paper, is getting more and more attention. An evaluation method based on the measurement of methanol concentration using ultraviolet\u2013visible spectrometer was proposed in this work. After the extraction from transformer oils, the methanol was oxidized using potassium permanganate. Then, chromotropic acid was used to react with the oxidation products (formaldehyde) to form a mauve clathrate, finally, the methanol content was measured using the spectroscopy. Different from traditional spectroscopy which calculate only by absorbance at the characteristic wavelength, this paper use the partial least squares method, obtain the relationship between the absorbance at selected regions and the concentration of methanol. The minimum detection limit for the proposed method was 10 ppb, whereas the correlation coefficient for the relationship between the absorbance and the concentration of methanol was as high as 0.99.",

        "abstract": "The aging degradation of paper insulation in transformers is usually evaluated by the dissolved products in oil, such as CO/CO2, furfural and methanol. However, these methods are difficult to explain the internal aging mechanism of paper insulation. In this paper, in the condition of simulated accelerated aging, the surface morphology and cellulose crystallinity were studied to explore the degradation mechanism of insulation paper under different aging time, which provided theoretical basis and precaution for the aging of insulation paper. The results showed that surface morphology of paper had no obvious changes in the early aging stage, but cracks and holes appeared on the surface in the severe aging stage. The relative crystallinity of insulation paper increased with the aging time, meaning that thermal aging changed the internal structure of cellulose. The reason was speculated to be that more hydrogen bonds were formed between the multiple small cellulose chains after the main cellulose chain break, which increased the crystallinity of the paper insulation.",

        "abstract": "In order to develop a novel detection method for the degree of polymerization (DP) of insulating papers, methanol was used as an indicator to explore the relationship between methanol concentration and DP in this paper. After extraction from oil, the methanol was oxidized and reacted with chromotropic acid to generate a purple-red compound. The spectral detection method was used to detect the concentration of methanol by absorbance, and then, the corresponding relationship between the concentration of methanol and the DP of insulating paper was established. Moreover, the detection methods based on furfural and methanol were compared. The results showed that methanol appeared during the initial aging period of the insulation paper, and the linear relationship between the methanol concentration and the DP of insulating paper was good. Compared with furfural, methanol was more sensitive to the change of DP in the early aging period, which proved that methanol could be used as a new type of indicator of insulating paper.",

        "abstract": "Paper insulation is an important kind of solid dielectric in power transformers which influences the safety and stable operation of the transformers. Furfural, as an important indicator in transformer oil, can evaluate the degradation degree of paper insulation and predict the remaining life of transformers. However, it is always inconvenient to detect furfural because of the extraction procedure. In this work, a novel no-extraction furfural-detection-method based on UV-Vis spectrometry was proposed to evaluate the aging of paper insulation by the degree of polymerization (DP). The results show that this furfuraldetection- method has a favorable linear relationship between the concentrations of furfural (Ck) and its characteristic absorbance. The coefficient of deviation is less than 6.9% (n=7) for the furfural detection, indicating the satisfactory accuracy of results. The correlation between DP of papers and Ck are simulated with the goodness of fit (R 2 =0.964). Then, the aging of paper insulation could be predicted by the calculation of DP.",

Traditional methods for detecting the concentration of methanol in transformer oil use gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). Because these traditional methods are time consuming and are high skill operations, an improved method for detecting the concentration of methanol, which is rapid and is a lower skill operation, is proposed in this paper. This method detects the concentration of methanol using spectroscopy. Potassium permanganate is added to oxidize methanol into formaldehyde, which reats with chromotropic acid producing a mauve complex. From processing the spectrum of the complex using partial least squares, the linear correlation coefficient is increased to 0.999 and the minimum detected concentration is down to 10 parts per billion.",

The chromatic dispersion images of fibers with different aging degree were obtained by polarizing microscope, and the eigenvalues (r, b, and Mahalanobis distance) of the images were extracted by the RGB (red, blue, and green) tricolor analysis method. Then, the correlation between the three eigenvalues and DP of paper insulation were simulated respectively. The results showed that the color of images changed from blue-purple to orange-yellow gradually with the increase of aging degree. For the three eigenvalues, the relationship between Mahalanobis distance and DP had the best goodness of fit (R2 = 0.98), higher than that of r (0.94) and b (0.94). The mean square error of the relationship between Mahalanobis distance and DP (52.17) was also significantly lower than that of r and b (97.58, 98.05). Therefore, the DP of unknown paper insulation could be calculated by the simulated relationship of Mahalanobis distance and DP.",

Its breakdown voltage was then measured at pulsating direct current (DC) voltage with various ripple factors, and alternating current (AC) and DC voltage for comparison, respectively. The AC breakdown voltage is the smallest, and pulsating DC (r = 1/5) breakdown voltage is the greatest before the paper reaches its end of life. A dielectric model was adopted to investigate the difference in magnitude of breakdown voltage at different voltage waveforms. Meanwhile, it was found that breakdown voltage fluctuated and even increased occasionally during the thermal aging process, and a somewhat opposite changing tendency versus aging time was observed for breakdown voltage at DC voltage and pulsating DC voltage with small ripple factors (r = 1/5 and 1/3), compared with AC voltage. The degree of polymerization (DP) and moisture content of the paper were measured, and the characteristics of the pores and cracks of the paper were obtained to investigate the possible influencing factors of breakdown voltage at different aging states. The results showed that the moisture content, oil absorption ability associated with pores and cracks of paper, and the damage to paper structure all contributed to the variation of the breakdown voltage versus aging time, while the importance of their influence differed as the aging state of paper varied.",

        "abstract": "According to the neuro-rehabilitation theory, compared with unilateral training, bilateral training is proven to be an effective method for hemiparesis, which affects the most part of stroke patients. In this study, a novel bilateral rehabilitation training system, which incorporates a lightweight exoskeleton device worn on the affected limb; a haptic device (Phantom Premium), which is used for generating a desired tactile feedback for the affected limb; and a VR (virtual reality) graphic interface, has been developed. The use of VR technology during rehabilitation can provide goal directed tasks with rewards and motivate the patient to undertake extended rehabilitation. This paper is mainly focused on elbow joint training, and other independent joints can be trained by easily changing the VR training interface. The haptic device is adopted to enable patients to use their own decision making abilities with a tactical feedback. Integrated with a VR-based graphic interface, the goal-oriented task can help to gradually recovery their motor function with a coordinative motion between two limbs. In particular, the proposed system can accelerate neural plasticity and motor recovery in those patients with little muscle strength by using the exoskeleton device. The exoskeleton device can provide from relatively high joint impedance to near-zero impedance, and can provide a partial assist as the patient requires.",

The biggest advantage of capsule robots is that they can be swallowed, move in narrow channels, drug delivery and surgery. However, to make itself be able to move in tight spaces, capsule robot must keep its volume small enough which means it also becomes the biggest challenge of the development of capsule robots. This paper carried out a series of simulations and experiments in order to evaluate the characteristic influence of different structures on motion performance for a magnetic-actuated screw jet microrobot (SJM). The whole system consists of three main parts, the power supply section, three-axes Helmholtz coils are to provide a uniform controllable rotating magnetic field; the simulated intestinal part, a transparent plastic pipe; a screw jet microrobot, it consists a radially magnetized O-ring type neodymium magnet and a rotating screw jet structure. Although we carried out this kind of robot over past few months, it still has a lot of uncertainty on the motion performance. The previous papers have proposed this type of magnetic actuated screw jet microrobot and its driving device, principle, etc., since we proved it can run smoothly (extra degree of freedom that enables various advanced functions such as axial position control). The research in paper consists of three evaluation parts, separately evaluated shell, screw, and different liquid environments. The first part evaluated the inlet and outlet size on the shell section, as for the second part, we evaluated the effect on screw with different pitch. The last part of the experiment is about experimenting different kinds of liquid. We also did the simulations and discussed about the motion performance in order to make sure that our results is realizable before the experiments. Combining the simulation results and experimental results, we will discuss the optimal choice of the design by the simulation in an ideal environment and the comparison of experimental results.",

We realized the separation of the capsule robot by the difference of the cut-off frequency. The axial magnetized magnet is put into the robot, and when the robot is close, the two robots can combine. And the motion of the two at low frequency is consistent, which can realize the synchronous motion. Finally, the two robots can realize active locomotion using a three-axis Helmholtz coils system. The developed capsule robot can be used to improve the capsule robot system and help people do experiments in vivo in the future.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this work, a lab-scale membrane system was developed to accommodate angular vibrations with a hollow fiber module. A series of filtration experiments were designed and implemented to investigate the effects of angular vibrations on fouling by various algae-derived foulants, including algal cells, debris, extracellular organic matter (EOM), and intracellular organic matter (IOM). The experimental results indicated the effects of angular vibrations on fouling mitigation at the frequency of 2\u202fHz in the following order: algal cells (~ 97.4%) u003e debris (~ 93.6%) u003e IOM (~ 81.8%) u003e EOM (~ 52.3%). The vibrations mainly targeted the cake layer formed by these foulants, but was ineffective for pore blocking which constituted a large portion of EOM fouling. Although the fouling rates were accelerated during the normal ultrafiltration of the combined foulants, the effects of angular vibrations continued to be impressive (67.8\u201392.6%). This was because the cake layer formation was the dominant fouling mechanism. Furthermore, the vibrations were found to improve the organic removal by alleviating concentration polarization. In this paper, quantitative analysis is presented to demonstrate the potential of angular vibrations to control algal fouling with the relatively low energy consumption of 0.034\u202fmW.",

        "abstract": "In this work, the effect of powdered activated carbon (PAC) on fouling by algal solution during ultrafiltration using two different PAC dosing strategies: pre-depositing PAC onto the membrane surfaces or the conventional addition of PAC to the bulk feed. The addition of PAC by either mode improved the removal of extracellular organic matter (EOM) from the algal solution. However, for the pre-deposition mode, increasing the PAC amount from 0 to 2.1\u202fg caused a steady increase in the membrane fouling rate (from 0.4 to 1.4\u202fkPa/h), whereas the opposite result (from 0.4 down to 0.1\u202fkPa/h) was found for the conventional PAC dosing mode. This is likely due to the differences in the initial arrangement of algal cells and PAC along the cake layer depths. The pre-deposited PAC avoided contact between cells and membranes, but aggravated the deformation of the cells and hindered their back-transport to the bulk solution. Furthermore, although the effect of PAC on the EOM fouling was marginal, there were highly synergistic effects when cells and EOM were present together in the PAC pre-deposition mode. Changes in the PAC dosing mode also altered the PAC-membrane interactions, inducing a higher cleaning efficiency of backwash for the conventionally-dosed PAC from membrane surfaces than that for the pre-deposited PAC.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Microalgae are ubiquitous in aquatic systems and are a highly diversified group of uni- and multicellular microorganisms. In low pressure-driven membrane systems, these cells and their secretions have a strong tendency to foul membranes and lead to a very low filtration efficiency. A significant amount of investigation on algal fouling of microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF) membranes has been conducted in recent years. In this paper, recent knowledge of both MF and UF membrane fouling by microalgal suspensions, including the mechanisms and factors influencing algal fouling control strategies, is reviewed. The main components and properties of microalgae suspension are summarized. As algal cells and algogenic organic matter (AOM) are major foulants in microalgae suspension, their roles in algal fouling are compared and critically assessed. Based on the fouling mechanisms of these cells and AOM, strategies for mitigation of algal fouling are provided in detail, including pretreating feedwater, changing membrane properties, and enhancing hydrodynamic conditions. The breakup and growth of cells and their consequential influences on fouling receive special attention. Finally, useful directions for further work on MF and UF algal fouling are indicated.",

Flat topography, groundwater dependence and a high proportion of agricultural water are the main features of WRDU in Sanjiang Plain. Due to large-scale development in the last 60 years, the ecological environment of Sanjiang Plain has changed significantly. In order to identify the eco-environmental problems and make regional ecological environment and water resources sustainable, trend and correlation analyses were performed to analyze the eco-environmental effects of WRDU from the aspects of water resources, land resources, vegetation and climate. The results show that the regional eco-environmental effects caused by WRDU in Sanjiang Plain are significant. The quantity and quality of groundwater resources and the social and ecological functions of land resources are significantly affected by the regional development and utilization of water resources, while the effect of surface water resources is not obvious. The changes of vegetation and climate are also significant, but the response mechanism to WRDU requires further study. With the changes of extent, pattern and degree of surface water utilization in Sanjiang Plain, the effect of surface water resources is becoming more and more prominent.",

The case of Jiamusi was studied as an example: an MCRC water use model was established and the model was solved to derive Jiamusiu0027s initial water use plan in the target year of 2020. The relationships between the economic benefits produced by water consumption and the groundwater exploitation rate, agricultural water consumption, chemical oxygen demand, and ecological water consumption were analyzed based on this plan: the trade-off among indicators of various dimensions was analyzed to obtain the relationship curves between the regulation indicators of the economic dimension and those of the other dimensions (resource, social, environmental and ecological dimensions). Finally, multi-dimensional regulation was applied to the plan based on the relationship curves from the trade-off analysis, and the best water use plan for the target year was proposed. This study provided a strong basis for setting thresholds for the planning and management of water use in Jiamusi.",

        "abstract": "Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is characterized by cognitive impairments in patients after surgery. Hippocampal neuroinflammation induced by surgery is highly associated with POCD. Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) is an enzyme that specifically hydrolyses cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which plays an important role during neuroinflammation and the process of learning and memory. However, the role of PDE4 in the development of POCD remains unclear. Male 14-month-old C57BL/6 mice received carotid artery exposure to mimic POCD. First, we evaluated cognitive performance by a Morris water maze (MWM) and fear conditioning system (FCS) test after surgery. The expression of PDE4 subtypes, pro-inflammatory cytokines, p-CREB and PSD95 as well as cAMP levels were investigated. Then, we used rolipram, a PDE4 inhibitor, to block the effects of PDE4. The cognitive performance of the mice and the expression of PDE4 subtypes, pro-inflammatory cytokines, p-CREB and PSD95 as well as cAMP levels were examined again. Mice displayed learning and memory impairment, overexpression of PDE4B and PDE4D, elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and reduction in the expression of p-CREB, PSD95 and cAMP levels after surgery. The expression of PDE4B and PDE4D in the hippocampus decreased following blocking of PDE4 by rolipram. Meanwhile, rolipram attenuated the cognitive impairment and the elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by surgery. Moreover, rolipram reversed the reduction of p-CREB and PSD95. These results indicate that PDE4 subtype overexpression may be involved in the development of surgery-induced cognitive dysfunction in mice.",

        "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is believed to be one of the primary causes of cognitive impairment. Previous studies showed that the antioxidant vitamin C (Vit C) performs many beneficial functions such as immunostimulant and anti-inflammatory actions, but its role in inflammatory cognitive impairment is unclear. In the current study, we investigated the effect and possible mechanism of action of Vit C in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cognitive impairment. Intracerebroventricular LPS-induced memory impairment was used as the model for neuroinflammatory cognitive dysfunction. Vit C was administered by intracerebroventricular microinjection 30\u202fmin prior to LPS exposure. It was found that Vit C significantly protected animals from LPS-induced memory impairment as evidenced by improved performance in the Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests without changes in spontaneous locomotor activity. Vit C pretreatment inhibited the activation of microglia and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2). Furthermore, Vit C pretreatment markedly decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) level, increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and modulated the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and p-p38 MAPK activation in the hippocampus of LPS-treated mice. Together, these results suggest that vitamin C pretreatment could protect mice from LPS-induced cognitive impairment, possibly through the modulation of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses.",

        "abstract": "The translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO) recently attracted increasing attention in the pathogenesis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study is testing the hypothesis that the overexpression of TSPO in hippocampus dentate gyrus (DG) could alleviate the anxiogenic-like response in the mice model of PTSD induced by foot-shock. In this study, hippocampal DG overexpression of TSPO significantly reversed the increase of the contextual freezing response, the decrease of the percentage of both entries into and time spent in the open arms in elevated plus maze test and the decrease of the account of crossings from the dark to light compartments in light-dark transition test induced by electric foot-shocks procedure. It was further showed that the behavioral effects of TSPO overexpression were blocked by PK11195, a selective TSPO antagonist. In addition, the expression of TSPO and level of allopregnanolone (Allo) decreased in the mouse model of PTSD, which was blocked by overexpression of TSPO in hippocampal dentate gyrus. The difference of neurogenesis among groups was consistent with the changes of TSPO and Allo, as evidenced by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)- positive cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. These results firstly suggested that TSPO in hippocampal dentate gyrus could exert a great effect on the occurrence and recovery of PTSD in this animal model, and the anti-PTSD-like effect of hippocampal TSPO over-expression could be at least partially mediated by up-regulation of Allo and subsequent stimulation of the adult hippocampal neurogenesis.",

        "abstract": "The 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is involved in the immune/inflammatory response. However, the exact role that TSPO plays in neuroinflammation-induced cognitive impairment is still elusive. The purpose of our present study was to investigate the effects of lentiviral-mediated hippocampal overexpression of the TSPO in a mouse model of LPS-induced cognitive impairment. We established a mouse cognitive impairment model using systematic daily administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (0.5 mg/kg). Microinjection of the dentate gyrus of the mouse with lentiviral vectors, which contained a cDNA targeting TSPO (Lv-), resulted in a significant increase in TSPO expression and allopregnanolone production. Mice treated with LPS showed cognitive deficits in the novel object recognition test and the Morris water maze test that could be ameliorated by TSPO overexpression. In addition, TSPO overexpression reversed LPS-induced microglial activation and accumulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1. Moreover, TSPO overexpression attenuated the LPS-induced impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis. Our results suggest that local overexpression of TSPO in the hippocampal dentate gyrus alleviated LPS-induced cognitive deficits, and its effects might be mediated by the attenuation of inflammatory cytokines, inhibition of microglial activation, and promotion of neurogenesis.",

Therefore, we investigated serum ESM-1 levels in patients with stress hyperglycemia having STEMI; 105 patients with STEMI and 33 individuals as a control group were included in the study. The patients were followed up for 3 months and major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) were recorded. Serum ESM-1 level was significantly higher in patients with stress hyperglycemia patients having STEMI (P < .05). In these patients, serum ESM-1 levels correlated positively with glucose levels (r = .21, P < .05). Multiple factor logistic regression analysis showed that serum ESM-1 levels >1.01 ng/mL (odds ratio 3.01, 95% confidence interval 1.05-8.64, P < .05) were an independent predictor of MACEs. Our findings suggest that ESM-1 is a novel biomarker overexpressed in patients with stress hyperglycemia having STEMI, admission glucose levels are associated with ESM-1 levels, and ESM-1 is an independent predictor of MACEs. An ESM-1 level >1.01 ng/mL is likely to predict a greater risk of MACEs.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of the short-term application of pantoprazole on the co-treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with aspirin and clopidogrel. A total of 207 acute patients showing primary symptoms of STEMI, who received successful emergent percutaneous coronary intervention treatment during hospitalization were randomly divided into two groups. In the test group proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), the patients were treated with a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel and pantoprazole, while those in the control group were treated only with aspirin and clopidogrel. Gastrointestinal bleeding events and major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) were observed in the two groups. Gastrointestinal bleeding events of the two groups mostly occurred within the first week of hospitalization, although the incidence in the PPIs group was significantly higher than that in the control group (p<0.05). However, no significant difference was observed for the incidence of MACEs between the two groups (p>0.05). In conclusion, the results of the present study have shown that the short-term application of pantoprazole combined with aspirin and clopidogrel does not increase the incidence of MACEs in patients with acute STEMI, reduces the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, and is thus worth promoting clinically, particularly for high-risk groups.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to observe and investigate the changes in the serum level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), the endothelial cell-specific molecule-1 (ESM-1) and short-term prognosis of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated by ticagrelor. We enrolled 107 patients with acute STEMI who were admitted in the Department of Cardiology for the first time with occurrence of symptoms, and we successfully performed emergency operation of percutaneous coronary intervention. The patients were divided into two groups, 54 patients in the ticagrelor group (treatment group) and 53 patients in the clopidogrel group (control group), according to the administration of ticagrelor or clopidogrel in dual anti-platelet therapy. Then, we observed the changes at the time of admission, at 24 h, and 4th and 7th day after administration and investigated the correlations between them and the effect of ticagrelor on the short-term prognosis of acute STEMI patients. Significant increases of the serum levels of hs-CRP and ESM-1 were seen in patients of the two groups 24 h after administration of drugs with statistically significant differences between the groups (P<0.05), and on the 4th and 7th day we found a downward trend with statistically significant differences (P<0.05). The level of ESM-1 enhanced the increase of hs-CRP, indicating there was a positive correlation between ESM-1 and hs-CRP (r=0.535, P<0.001). A comparison of the occurrence rates of ischemic outcome event, bleeding and overall adverse events between the two groups yielded no statistically significant difference (P>0.05). In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that ticagrelor can reduce the prevalence of inflammatory reactions rapidly and stabilize the functions of vascular endothelium to improve the stability of atherosclerosis plaque and decrease the occurrence rate of thrombosis as well as ischemic outcome event without any obvious increase in the risk of bleeding. Thus, ticagrelor should be recommended in clinical practices for the treatment of patients with STEMI.",

In this paper, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that EO sampling with a broadband femtosecond (fs) laser could significantly eliminate these distortions below the Reststrahlen band. Our simulation results show that the oscillations and dips in the signals of EO response function of thick crystals are smoothed out by the broadband spectrum of the femtosecond laser. In the experiment, we use a laser with a bandwidth of 100 nm and a low temperature GaAs photoconductive antenna to generate typical THz pulses (0.1\u20133 THz). The measurement results confirm that a    $langle {110} rangle $  -oriented 3-mm-thick ZnTe crystal is an attractive EO material for sampling THz pulse below 3 THz and agree with simulation results. This technique is particularly useful in areas where a large time window is needed, for example in the THz time-domain spectroscopy system.",

Our model contains two main aspects: the propagation of the THz pulse (1.5\u20136\u202fTHz) along the transport line and the THz EO process in the detection crystal. The diffraction, Fabry\u2013Perot and focusing effects are included in the THz propagation process. The phase mismatch, the frequency-dependent EO coupling coefficient and geometrical overlap between probe and THz pulses as well as the group velocity dispersion and finite duration of the probe pulse are considered in the THz EO process. The calculation shows that the diffraction in the TPX window and the Fabry\u2013Perot effect in the GaP crystal are crucial for retrieving the details of the THz optical pulse. While for electron bunches, the detected Coulomb electric field will be significantly broadened due to the relatively low relativistic Lorenz factor (    \u03b3  =  10  \u2013  20    ). Therefore, a convenient deconvolution algorithm is utilized to reconstruct THz electric field from the distorted EO signals, where the truncated singular value decomposition method is employed. Our algorithm is verified to work well even with a low signal-to-noise ratio (20\u202fdB) in the future measurement.",

        "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been isolated from many tissues and organs. However, there is much dispute as to whether MSCs exist in peripheral blood. This may be due to the limited identification methods of MSCs, especially the lack of detection markers for phenotypic characteristics. In this study, as many as 10 surface markers of MSCs derived from rat peripheral blood (rPBMSCs) were analyzed after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilization. Our results suggest that mobilized rPBMSCs overexpress mesenchymal markers, including CD90, CD44, CD29, CD73 and CD105, but do not express CD45, CD11b, CD79a, CD34 or HLA-DR. This is in conformity with the standard definition of MSCs by the International Society for Cellular Therapy. In addition, the colony-forming efficiency of the mobilized rat peripheral blood was 15.83 \u00b1 1.61/106, significantly outnumbering that of the nonmobilized group, which was 0.28 \u00b1 0.1/106 (p < 0.01). Combining the growth characteristics with the differential capacities of mobilized rPBMSCs towards forming osteocytes, chondrocytes and adipocytes, we further confirmed the existence of rPBMSCs. Additionally, this treatment could improve locomotive function after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. Due to their convenient collection, fewer complications, cost effectiveness and suitability for autograft, PBMSCs might be a substitute for MSCs derived from bone marrow and provide promising prospects for the cell-based therapy of SCI.",

        "abstract": "Mobilized peripheral blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PB-MSCs) mainly derived from bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) exert a similar anti-inflammatory effect. However, the mechanism of anti-inflammatory effect of mobilized PB-MSCs by a combination of G-CSF and AMD3100 remains unclear. Cultured rat PB-MSCs mobilized by G-CSF/AMD3100 have shown typical surface markers and potential for multiple differentiations, similar to non-mobilized BM-MSCs. In a co-culture system, rat M0-type macrophages co-cultured with PB-MSCs have shown higher expression of M2 markers including CD206, Arg-1, IL-10, and CCL-22 than BM-MSCs, indicating that PB-MSCs induced greater M0 polarization to M2. Furthermore, compared with BM-MSCs, PB-MSCs in a co-culture system with lipopolysaccharide-induced M1-type macrophages more efficiently promoted M1 polarization to M2, accompanied by increasing expression of CD206, Arg-1, IL-10, and CCL-22 while decreasing expression of M1 markers including iNOS, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, indicating that PB-MSCs triggered greater M1 polarization to M2. Subsequently, polymerase chain reaction arrays showed higher expressions of both IL1rn and Tnfrsf11b in PB-MSCs versus BM-MSCs. In response to an inflammatory niche, such as TNF-\u03b1, PB-MSCs have shown higher expression and release of IL1RA, causing greater M2 polarization of macrophages, and the special effects may be almost entirely abolished through the neutralization antibody of IL1RA. Mechanistic studies determined that PB-MSCs showed higher levels NF-\u03baBp65 and NF-\u03baBp-p65 than BM-MSCs, which could be obviously enhanced by TNF-\u03b1. And the increased IL1RA expression by TNF-\u03b1 in PB-MSCs could be markedly canceled by an NF-\u03baB inhibitor PDTC. Interestingly, mimicking the mobilized PB-MSCs by a combination of G-CSF and AMD3100 , BM-MSCs were treated with G-CSF and/or AMD3100 , showing the increased expressions of NF-\u03baBp65 and IL1RA, which could be prominently abolished by PDTC. Therefore, targeting IL1rn, gene modification or drug intervention for MSCs may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for human diseases, especially inflammatory diseases.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   With inspiration from the superhydrophobic quality of many living surfaces in nature, in this paper, a Ni coating with excellent hydrophobicity was prepared on the surface of 304 stainless steel by the combined method of sandblasting and electrodeposition. The two-dimensional and three-dimensional morphologies of the sample surfaces were characterized by a scanning electron microscope and a laser scanning confocal microscope, respectively. An X-ray diffractometer, contact angle measurements, and an electrochemical workstation were used to characterize the crystal structure, wettability, and corrosion of the coating, respectively. The results showed that the wetting state of the prepared Ni coating by the combined method is nearly superhydrophobic, the water contact angle (CA) can be raised up to 149.4\u00b0, and a stable hydrophobic ability is achieved. Using the Cassie-Baxter equation, it is found that about 88.76% of the coating serves as the contact area for the water droplets and air, leading to the roll-down property of the water droplets on the surface. The corrosion resistance of the Ni coating is clearly enhanced in the hydrochloric acid immersion test, and the prepared Ni coating has a lower corrosion current density  I   corr   (A/cm 2 ) as analyzed by the Tafel curve. These studies provide a theoretical reference for the application of stainless steel in corrosive environment fields.",

We use a simulated atmosphere channel with a tunable weak turbulence, and bit error rate (BER) curves of back-to-back transmission, which are measured and contrasted, respectively. To our knowledge, it is the first demonstration in the research of DWDM-DP-QPSK high-speed free-space optical (FSO) transmission in an atmospheric channel with tunable turbulence. For 100\u00a0GHz channel spacing, receiving sensitivities can be \u221233.6, \u221232.7, and \u221232.1\u2009\u2009dBm for 300, 336, and 384\u2009\u2009Gbit\u2009\u2009/\u2009\u2009s DWDM-PM-QPSK signals, respectively, at BER of 3.8\u2009\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u200910\u2009\u2009\u2212\u2009\u20093 (FEC limit).

        "abstract": "The anti-CD52 antibody has already been approved for the treatment of patients with resistant chronic lymphocytic leukemia, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, and has demonstrable efficacy against stem cell transplantation rejection. A CHO cell line expressing a humanized anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody (mAb-TH) was cultivated in both fed-batch and perfusion modes, and then purified. The critical quality attributes of these mAb variants were characterized and the pharmacokinetics (PK) properties were investigated. Results showed that the perfusion culture achieved higher productivity, whereas the fed-batch culture produced more aggregates and acid components. Additionally, the perfusion culture produced similar fucose, more galactose and a higher proportion of sialic acid on the anti-CD52 mAb compared to the fed-batch culture. Furthermore, the perfusion process produced anti-CD52 mAb had higher complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) efficacy than that produced by the fed-batch culture, a result probably linked to its higher galactose content. However, antibody produced by fed-batch and perfusion cultures showed similar PK profiles in vivo. In conclusion, perfusion is a more efficient method than fed-batch process in the production of functional anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody. Product quality variants of anti-CD52 mAb were found in different cell culture processes, which demonstrated different physiochemical and biological activities, but comparable PK properties. Whether these observations apply to all mAbs await further investigation.",

        "abstract": "Charge heterogeneity has been broadly studied as a critical quality attribute during monoclonal antibody (mAb) production that may subsequently affect product stability and biopotency. However, the charge variation distribution is poorly controlled, so methods of more effective control need to be explored. In this study, the combined effects of temperature shift (37-34, 37-32, or 37-30\u00a0\u00b0C) and hydrolysate addition (0.100\u00a0g/L) to culture feed on the charge heterogeneity of anti-IgE mAb were investigated. The results showed that the distribution of charge variation was significantly regulated by the combination of hydrolysate addition with a highly sub-physiological temperature (34\u00a0\u00b0C). In addition, under this condition, the main peak content significantly increased, and the acidic peak content significantly decreased. Furthermore, we explored Lys variant content, which is the major basic variant content, as well as its relationship with temperature shift and hydrolysate addition. Lys variant levels were positively related to the Lys and Arg concentrations in the medium and negatively related to carboxypeptidase B and carboxypeptidase H transcript levels. The combination of temperature shift and hydrolysate addition can thus effectively improve anti-IgE mAb charge heterogeneity and significantly increase main variant levels and decrease acidic variant levels.",

        "abstract": "Hyperosmolality has been commonly investigated due to its effects on the production and quality characteristics of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) produced in CHO cell fed-batch cultures. However, the application of hyperosmolality at different times and its effect on biopotency have seldom been researched, especially in perfusion culture. In our study, different degrees of hyperosmolality induced by sodium chloride were investigated in anti-IgE rCHO cell fed-batch cultures and anti-CD52 rCHO cell perfusion cultures during the initial and stable phases. The results showed that the initial hyperosmolality group (IHG) in fed-batch and early phase of perfusion cultures exhibited significant suppression of the viable cell density yet an enhancement in specific productivity, whereas the stable hyperosmolality group (SHG) achieved higher mAb production in both fed-batch and perfusion cultures. Additionally, the SHG produced less aggregates and acidic charge variants than IHG in fed-batch culture, which differed from perfusion cultures. However, the contents of non-glycosylation heavy chain (NGHC) and man5 were higher in SHG than in IHG in fed-batch cultures at plus 60 and 120\u00a0mOsm/kg, which was similar to perfusion cultures. Furthermore, the biopotency in the IHG was higher than in the SHG at plus 60 and 120\u00a0mOsm/kg in fed-batch cultures, which is similar to complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) efficacy in perfusion cultures. The biopotency of all group was acceptable, except FI3. Thus, the study shows that hyperosmolality at a certain level could be beneficial for both mAb production, quality and biopotency, which could play an important role in process development for commercial production.",

Once the invading pathogens are recognized by pattern recognition receptors expressed on the innate immune cells, the innate immune response is stimulated to exert host defense function, which is the first line to fight against PA infection. As a converging point of cytosolic DNA sense signaling, stimulator of interferon genes (STING) was reported to participate in host-pathogen interaction. However, the role of STING in regulating PA-induced corneal inflammation and bacterial clearance remains unknown. Our data demonstrated that STING was activated in murine model of PA keratitis and in -cultured macrophages, indicated by Western blot, immunostaining, and flow cytometry. To explore the role of STING in PA keratitis, we used siRNA to silence STING and 2',3'-cGAMP to activate STING  and , and the  data found out that STING promoted host resistance against PA infection. To investigate the reason why STING played a protective role in PA keratitis, the inflammatory cytokine secretion and bacterial load were measured by using real-time PCR and bacterial plate count, respectively. Our data demonstrated that STING suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines and enhanced bacterial elimination in murine model of PA keratitis and in PA-infected macrophages. To further investigate the mechanism beneath, the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and the bactericidal mechanism were measured by western-blot, immunofluorescence, and real-time PCR, respectively. Our data indicated that STING suppressed inflammatory cytokine expressing  restraining NF-\u03baB activity and enhanced inducible NO synthase expression, an oxygen-dependent bactericidal mechanism. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that STING promoted host resistance against PA keratitis and played a protective role in PA-infected corneal disease,  inhibiting corneal inflammation and enhancing bacterial killing.",

Methods Cell viability and catenin beta 1 ( CTNNB1) expression in RAW264.7 cells following P. aeruginosa infection versus uninfected cells, were detected by cell counting kit-8 assay and \u03b2-catenin Western blots. RAW264.7 cells with CTNNB1 overexpression were established with \u03b2-catenin lentivirus using flow cytometry and clonogenic limiting dilution assays. Bacterial killing was measured by plate counts; phagocytosis and nitric oxide (NO) were measured by flow cytometry; and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured using Griess reaction. Autophagy was determined by microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 alpha-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate (LC3-II) protein levels and formation of LC3 puncta, using Western blot and immunofluorescence staining. Results Following P. aeruginosa infection, RAW264.7 cell \u03b2-catenin levels were reduced in a time- and multiplicity of infection-dependent manner. CTNNB1 overexpression was associated with increased P. aeruginosa elimination, but had no effect on RAW264.7 cell phagocytosis, ROS and NO. CTNNB1 overexpression reduced LC3-II levels and formation of LC3 puncta, suggesting autophagy inhibition. Rapamycin/starvation-induced autophagy resulted in reduced bacterial killing following P. aeruginosa infection. Conclusion \u03b2-catenin may promote bacterial killing via suppression of P. aeruginosa-induced macrophage autophagy.",

        "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a common Gram-negative bacterium and can cause serious infections, including hospital-acquired pneumonia, suppurative bacterial keratitis and acute burn wound infection. The pathogenesis of PA infections is closely associated with excessive inflammatory responses and bacterial virulence factors. Wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 3A (Wnt3a), an upstream mediator in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, has been implicated as a regulator of inflammation. However, its role in PA-induced inflammation and bacterial clearance remains unknown. In the present study, the efficacy of Wnt3a conditioned media (Wnt3a-CM) was assessed using western blotting and immunofluorescence, which showed that \u03b2-catenin, a downstream molecule of Wnt3a, was upregulated and translocated to the nucleus following exposure to 50% Wnt3a-CM for 6 h. To explore the role of Wnt3a in PA-induced inflammation, the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis in macrophages were measured using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry, respectively. This indicated that Wnt3a suppressed inflammation by reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and by promoting apoptosis in macrophages. Furthermore, the mechanism of macrophage-mediated bacterial killing was investigated, and the results indicated that Wnt3a enhanced macrophage-mediated intracellular bacterial killing via the induction of the production of cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide and \u03b2-defensins 1. Taken together, the current study explored the role of Wnt3a in inflammation and bacterial invasion, which may provide an improved understanding of host resistance to PA infection.",

The Tm-doped-fiber MOPA beam was split by a polarizing beam splitter into two arms to pump the OPG and OPA stages, respectively. The generated signal from the OPG was spectrally filtered by a diffraction grating combined with an adjustable aperture to act as the tunable seed light for the OPA. Widely tunable output in the range of 2552\u20132960 nm (signal) and 5733\u20138305 nm (idler) was obtained from the OPA with narrow linewidths of 1.4 cm \u20131  (signal, 2942 nm) and 9 cm  \u20131  (idler, 5800 nm), respectively. The maximum pulse energy of 0.40  \u03bc J (signal, 2942 nm) and 0.16  \u03bc J (idler, 5800 nm) was obtained at an overall conversion efficiency of 22.4% for the OPA stage.

According to the wall pressure of combustor measured through the test, the distribution of other airflow parameters in the combustor was obtained by calculating with a one-dimensional analysis method, and the mode transition process in the condition of fuel flow rate change was studied. In addition, the position that the airflow in the isolator accessed to the subsonic velocity and the location of \u201cchoked thermal throat\u201d at the combustor downstream were determined by analyzing of pressure distribution in the combustor. The results indicated that sole hydrogen combustion brought a supersonic combustion mode, then combined combustion of hydrogen and kerosene induced a subsonic combustion mode and combustion-induced pressure disturbance had been spread to the entrance to the combustor. In cases of sole kerosene combustion and the fuel equivalence ratio being kept at 0.53 and 0.61 respectively, both were in the subsonic combustion mode. Gradual increment of the fuel equivalence ratio was accompanied by enlarging subsonic combustion area. In case of combined combustion of hydrogen and kerosene, and improving kerosene flow rate, supersonic combustion mode was transformed to a subsonic one in a gradual manner.",

Major combustion vitiation species (H 2 O and CO 2 ) were added to the airstream. The tests were conducted in a direct-connect combustor with a Mach 2.02 inlet, hydrogen and kerosene were chosen as the test fuel. In the cases fueled with hydrogen, with an equivalence ratio of about 0.25, transition from cavity shear-layer combustion mode to combined shear-layer/recirculation combustion mode was observed in three test conditions, clean air stream, air stream with 4.5% H 2 O and 4.5% H 2 O\u00a0+\u00a04.5% CO 2 , but not occurred in the case with 4.5% CO 2 . In addition, in cases fueled with kerosene, the equivalence ratios were about 0.53 and 0.73 and tests with two matching types in vitiated air were conducted: A. matching total temperature and total pressure; B. matching static temperature and static pressure. Results show that the pressure profile decreased with the increasing H 2 O and CO 2  contents, but the difference of pressure between the two matching types was not significant because of the small difference of two matching types.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTAn experimental study was conducted to characterize the effects of vitiate species (H2O and CO2) on supersonic combustion. These species were added to an initially clean airflow that was supplied by an electrically heated direct-connected facility. Wall pressures were measured by pressure sensors, combined with combustion optical images, and the influence of major vitiate species (H2O and CO2) on supersonic combustion was analyzed. Experimental results showed that the presence of vitiate species decreased combustor pressures by 3% to 30% for the same fuel equivalence ratio. The combustion flame images indicated that the flame-spreading angle decreased with the increase of the molar fraction of H2O and CO2, and when the molar fraction of CO2 was increased to 3.5%, an illogical oscillation, specifically embodying as the flame round switching between the upstream cavity and the downstream cavity, could be observed in the combustion, which might possibly cause the flame extinction.",

        "abstract": "Maternal-effect genes are especially critical for early embryonic development after fertilization and until massive activation of the embryonic genome occurs. By applying a tandem mass tag (TMT)-labeled quantitative proteomics combined with RNA sequencing approach, the proteome of the buffalo was quantitatively analyzed during parthenogenesis of mature oocytes and the two-cell stage embryo. Of 1,908 quantified proteins, 123 differed significantly. The transcriptome was analyzed eight stages (GV, MII, 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, 16-cell, morula, blastocyst) of Buffalo using the RNA sequencing approach , and a total of 3567 unique genes were identified to be differently expressed between all consecutive stages of pre-implantation development. Validation of proteomics results (TUBB3, CTNNA1, CDH3, MAP2K1), which are involved in tight junction and gap junction, revealing that the maternal expression of the proteins possibly plays a role in the formation of cellular junctions firstly after parthenogenetic activation. Correlation and hierarchical analyses of transcriptional profiles and the expression of NPM2 and NLRP5 mRNA of buffalo in vitro developed oocytes and parthenogenetic embryos indicated that the \"maternal-to-zygotic transition\" (MZT) process might exist in the model of parthenogenesis, which similar to normally fertilized embryo, and it may occur between the 8-cell to 16-cell stage. These data provide a rich resource for further studies on maternal proteins and genes, and are conducive to improving nuclear transfer technology.",

As a result, 1461 proteins were identified, 93 of them were found to be differentially expressed (>1.5-fold), including 52 up-regulated proteins and 41 down-regulated proteins during sperm capacitation. 88 out of 93 proteins were annotated and classified. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that most of the differently expressed proteins (DEPs) were involved in the Biological Process of transport, cytoskeleton organization, sexual reproduction, and spermatogenesis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated that DEPs were mainly involved in the pathways of metabolic pathways, PPAR signaling pathway, and oxidative phosphorylation. Western blot (WB) assay confirmed the expressional variation of VAMP4 and APOC3 proteins. Our date provided a foundation for studying the changes in protein expression during sperm capacitation, which contributing to identifying marker proteins that may be associated with sperm capacitation.",

Supplementation with ALC during IVM significantly improved the rates of oocyte cleavage and morula and blastocyst formation, and increased MMP after vitrification compared with unsupplemented vitrified oocytes (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Using a bidirectional orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis based on positive ion matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry data, five phospholipid ions (m/z 728.7 (phosphatidylcholine (PC) 32:3), 746.9 (PC 32:5), 760.6 (PC 34:1), 768.8 (PC P-36:3) and 782.6 (PC 36:4); P\u2009<\u20090.05) were identified as significantly more abundant in fresh oocytes than in unsupplemented vitrified oocytes.

SeseC_01411 has been proven to be immunogenic. However, its protective efficacy remained to be evaluated. In the present study, the purified recombinant SeseC_01411 could elicit a strong humoral antibody response and protect against lethal challenge with virulent SEZ in mice. Our finding confirmed that SeseC_01411 distributes on the surface of SEZ. In addition, the hyperimmune sera against SeseC_01411 could efficiently kill the bacteria in the phagocytosis test. The present study identified the immunogenic protein, SeseC_01411, as a novel surface protective antigen of SEZ.",

        "abstract": "Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus (S. zooepidemicus) is responsible for peritonitis, septicemia, meningitis, arthritis and several other serious diseases in various species. Recent studies have demonstrated that CD44 is implicated in the process of host defense against pathogenic microorganisms. In the present study, the role of CD44 in the host response to S. zooepidemicus infection was investigated in a mouse model. Upon intraperitoneal infection with S. zooepidemicus, the expression of CD44 on the peritoneal exudate cells from wild-type (WT) mice was increased. CD44 deficiency accelerated mortality, which was accompanied by increased peritoneal bacterial growth and dissemination to distant body sites. CD44 knock-out (KO) mice showed enhanced early inflammatory cell recruitment into the peritoneal fluid on S. zooepidemicus infection. In line with this, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines in peritoneal exudate cells and peritoneal macrophages of CD44 KO mice were increased compared with those of WT mice. In addition, CD44 deficiency was associated with reduced expression of A20, a negative regulator in TLR signaling. Overall, the present study suggests that CD44 plays a protective role in antibacterial defense against S. zooepidemicus in mice.",

CD44 is a transmembrane adhesion molecule involved in innate and adaptive immune responses. The aim of this study was to determine the protective role of CD44 during S. zooepidemicus infection. CD44-deficient mice exhibited reduced macrophage accumulation in the bronchoalveolar space and enhanced bacterial outgrowth and dissemination, which resulted in reduced mouse survival. An in vitro analysis revealed that CD44 can directly bind to S. zooepidemicus. Additionally, S. zooepidemicus interacted with macrophage-associated CD44, as reflected by the reduced uptake of S. zooepidemicus by CD44-deficient macrophages. These data suggest that CD44 contributes to effective antibacterial defense during S. zooepidemicus infection, thereby limiting the accompanying injury and death.",

        "abstract": "Millimeter Wavelength Cloud Radar (MMCR) data from Dec. 1996 to Dec. 2010, collected at the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program Southern Great Plains (SGP) site are used to examine the diurnal cycle of hydrometeor occurrence. These data are categorized into clouds (-40 dBZe \u2264 reflectivity u003c -10 dBZe), drizzle and light precipitation (-10 dBZe \u2264 reflectivity u003c 10 dBZe), and heavy precipitation (reflectivity \u2265 10dBZe). The same criteria are implemented for the observation-equivalent reflectivity calculated by feeding outputs from a Multiscale Modeling Framework (MMF) climate model into a radar simulator. The MMF model consists of the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) with conventional cloud parameterizations replaced by a cloud resolving model (CRM). We find that a radar simulator combined with the simple reflectivity categories can be an effective approach for evaluating diurnal variations in model hydrometeor occurrence. It is shown that the MMF only marginally captures observed increases in the occurrence of boundary layer clouds after sunrise in spring and autumn, and does not capture diurnal changes in boundary layer clouds during the summer. Above the boundary layer, the MMF captures reasonably well diurnal variations in the vertical structure of clouds, light and heavy precipitation in the summer but not in the spring.",

The study uses a set of atmospheric states that were created specifically for the SGP and for the purpose of investigating under what synoptic conditions models compare well with observations on a statistical basis (rather than using case studies or seasonal or longer time scale averaging). Differences in the annual mean diurnal cycle between observations and the MMF are decomposed into differences due to the relative frequency of states, the daily mean vertical profile of hydrometeor occurrence, and the (normalized) diurnal variation of hydrometeors in each state. Here the hydrometeors are classified as cloud or precipitation based solely on the reflectivity observed by a millimeter radar or generated by a radar simulator. The results show that the MMF does not capture the diurnal variation of low clouds well in any of the states but does a reasonable job capturing the diurnal variations of high clouds and precipitation in some states. In particular, the diurnal variations in states that occur during summer are reasonably captured by the MMF, while the diurnal variations in states that occur during the transition seasons (spring and fall) are not well captured. Overall, the errors in the annual composite are due primarily to errors in the daily mean of hydrometeor occurrence (rather than diurnal variations), but errors in the state frequency (that is, the distribution of weather states in the model) also play a significant role.",

Simulation system consists of 482 methane molecules in hydrate and 3027 randomly distributed bulk water molecules. Through analyses of simulation results, decomposition number of hydrate cages, density of methane molecules, radial distribution function for oxygen atoms, mean square displacement and coefficient of diffusion of methane molecules have been studied. A significant result shows that structure I methane hydrate decomposes from hydrate-bulk water interface to hydrate interior. As temperature rises and pressure drops, the stabilization of hydrate will weaken, decomposition extent will go deep, and mean square displacement and coefficient of diffusion of methane molecules will increase. The studies can provide important meanings for the microscopic decomposition mechanisms analyses of methane hydrate.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   When a horizontal well is drilled through the natural gas hydrate (NGH) strata with different abundance, the NGH-bearing solid debris tends to lead to the deposit and adhesion of solid particles in the lateral sections and consequently cuttings carrying is not smooth. In this paper, the critical return rate model of drilling fluid in the case of cuttings rolling (normal drilling) and saltation (pump off for sand settling) under NGH adhesion in the laterals was established according to the force and migration laws of cuttings under the condition of multiphase flow in a horizontal well and the particle migration theory. Then, numerical simulation was conducted and the influential factors and migration laws of cuttings starting in the case of normal drilling and pump off were analyzed. And the following results were obtained. First, the critical starting flow rate decreases with the rise of NGH abundance and it is higher when the NGH adhesion is taken into account. Besides, the higher the NGH abundance, the greater the effect of NGH adhesion. Second, the critical starting flow rate increases with the rise of drilling cuttings particle size when the NGH abundance is less than 85%; and it decreases with the rise of drilling cuttings particle size when the NGH abundance is more than 85%. Third, the critical starting flow rate decreases with the rise of drilling fluid density and viscosity. And fourth, under the same conditions, the critical return rate for saltation is about 1.28 times that for rolling. It is suggested that the rolling model should be adopted for the normal drilling while the saltation model for the recycle after pump-off sand settling. The research results are of great significance to the optimization of NGH drilling parameters and the reduction of drilling safety risks.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Marine natural gas hydrate (NGH) reservoirs in China are characterized by shallow burial depth and weak cementing. In view of these characteristics, it is in an urgent need to develop a series of technologies and support tools to ensure safe, economical, green and efficient NGH exploitation. In this paper, a new technical idea of NGH jet breaking and fluidization exploitation without changing the temperature and pressure conditions of NGH reservoirs was proposed, and the support nozzle tools for NGH jet breaking was designed, experimentally tested and optimized. Then, the relationships between the jet breaking parameters of nozzles (e.g. working pressure drop, flow rate, and lifting and lowering velocity and frequency) and the borehole diameters and breaking rates of broken NGH were investigated based on laboratory tests, and the field construction engineering charts of NGH jet breaking and fluidization exploitation were established. Finally, this method was practically verified at Well Liwan 3 in the South China Sea. And following research results were obtained. First, the NGH jet breaking and fluidization exploitation technology can increase the production efficiency of NGH exploitation, protect the safety of reservoir bottom and reduce the energy consumption of NGH exploitation. Second, by using the nozzle tools of NGH jet breaking, the generated borehole diameters are regular, broken particles can flow back well, and the lowering velocity of jet breaking without pilot holes is less than 7.1\u00a0m/h. Third, the engineering charts of NGH jet breaking and fluidization exploitation interpret the influential laws of jet breaking behaviors and construction parameters on the borehole diameters and breaking rates of NGH so as to provide a reference for the selection of NGH production test technology parameters. And fourth, the successful implementation of the NGH jet breaking and fluidization technology in the production tests of Well Liwan 3 verifies the feasibility of NGH jet breaking and fluidization exploitation process, and exhibits its promising application prospects in NGH future commercial exploitation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A dynamic analysis model considering the actual riser string configuration is established to analyze the mechanical behavior of a drilling riser. The riser in this model is regarded as a simply supported beam located in the vertical plane and is subjected to axial and lateral ocean environment loadings. The model is solved using the finite element method. The validity of the analysis model has been proved by a similar experiment conducted in a deep water basin and ANSYS. Riser lateral displacement, bending moment, and deflection of the deep water well considering actual riser string configuration in South China Sea are simulated. The effects of top tension, drilling platform drift distance, surface current speed, wave height, wave period, wave length, wind speed and damping coefficient on riser lateral displacement, bending moment, and deflection are also discussed. Results indicate that riser string configuration has a significant effect on riser mechanical behavior, particularly in the distribution of bending moment. Riser string configuration designing according to concrete ocean environment can significantly improve the riser\u2019s mechanical behavior. The distribution of riser lateral displacement, bending moment, and deflection increases with the increase in surface current speed and drilling platform drift distance, whereas decreases with the increasing top tension and damping coefficient. The distribution of riser lateral displacement, bending moment, and deflection significantly increases with the increase in surface current speed and large current speed may lead to large lateral displacement, bending moment, and deflection. Increasing top tension can significantly decrease riser mechanical behavior parameters and avoid large lateral displacement, bending moment, and deflection when suffering extreme ocean environment conditions in deepwater drilling field. Drilling platform should avoid a large drift distance, which may result in the deflection over the flex joint working range and the enlargement of the riser bend moment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To determine the spatial distribution and variability in the health status of the Naolihe Basin, a water-based system was introduced, and 27 indexes were selected within the water-based system theoretical frame. The Naolihe watershed was divided into 12 subareas, and the health status of each subarea was evaluated using a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method with weightings calculated using an improved combined entropy-weighting method and analytic hierarchy process. Three semi-variability models (spherical, exponential, and Gaussian) for the Kriging interpolation method were used to analyze the spatial variability of the basin\u2019s health status. The Kriging interpolation method with the Gaussian model delivered the highest accuracy. Spatial variability analysis showed that the health status of the Naolihe Basin was mainly affected by river direction, topography, and regional economic development level. The health state of the southern area of the Naolihe River was better than that of the northern area, and the health state gradually improved from east to west in the Naolihe Basin. In addition, the health statuses of several specific areas were slightly lower, which was caused by overdevelopment.",

The proposed ensemble surrogate model in this paper consists of the following three individual surrogate models: Kriging, radial basis functions and least squares support vector machines. The Adaptive Metropolis-Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is used to assign weights to the three models. Accuracy and robustness of the ensemble surrogate model were tested on not only conservative contaminants but also contaminants containing chemical reaction. The results indicated that the proposed ensemble surrogate model is an effective method to solve the inverse contaminant source identification problems with a high degree of accuracy and short computation time.",

        "abstract": "An analytical method was developed for measuring the effect of OATP1B2 deficiency on plasma levels of the kinase inhibitor regorafenib and its metabolites regorafenib-N-oxide, N-desmethyl-regorafenib-N-oxide, and regorafenib-N-\u03b2-glucuronide (RG) in mice. Compounds were separated by liquid chromatography and monitored by a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in the selected reaction monitoring mode after positive electrospray ionization. All calibration curves were linear in the selected concentration range (R\u202f\u2265\u202f0.99). The lower limit of quantification was 5\u202fng/mL for the four analytes. Within-day precisions, between-day precisions, and accuracies were 2.59-6.82%, 3.97-11.3%, and 94.5-111%, respectively. The identification and structure elucidation of RG, isolated from human urine, was performed by NMR. Compared with wild-type mice given regorafenib (10\u202fmg/kg), deficiency of the drug transporter OATP1B2 in vivo had minimal effects on plasma levels of parent drug and the metabolite regorafenib-N-oxide, and N-desmethyl-regorafenib-N-oxide. However, the area under the curve and peak levels of RG were increased by 5.6-fold and 5.1-fold, respectively, in OATP1B2-knockout mice. In conclusion, our analytical method allowed accurate and precise quantitation of regorafenib and its main metabolites in mouse plasma, and is suitable for evaluation of transporter-dependent pharmacokinetic properties of these agents in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Regorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor used in the treatment of various solid tumors, undergoes extensive uridine 5'-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (Ugt)1a9-mediated glucuronidation to form regorafenib-N-\u03b2-glucuronide (M7; RG), but the contribution of hepatic uptake transporters, such as organic anion-transporting polypeptide (Oatp)1b2, to the pharmacokinetics of regorafenib remains poorly understood. Using NONMEM-based, population-based, parent-metabolite modeling, we found that Oatp1b2 and sex strongly impact the systemic exposure to RG in mice receiving oral regorafenib. Metabolic studies revealed that the liver microsomal expression of cytochrome P450 (Cyp)3a11 is twofold lower in female mice, whereas Ugt1a9 levels and function are not sex dependent. This finding is consistent with the metabolism of regorafenib occurring via two competing pathways, and the lack of Oatp1b2 results in decreased clearance of RG. The described model provides mechanistic insights into the in vivo disposition of regorafenib.",

High risk subtypes continue to have poor outcomes with event free survival rates <40% despite the use of high intensity chemotherapy in combination with hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Here we combine high-throughput screening, intracellular accumulation assays, and in vivo efficacy studies to identify therapeutic strategies for pediatric AML. We report therapeutics not currently used to treat AML, gemcitabine and cabazitaxel, have broad anti-leukemic activity across subtypes and are more effective relative to the AML standard of care, cytarabine, both in vitro and in vivo. JAK inhibitors are selective for acute megakaryoblastic leukemia and significantly prolong survival in multiple preclinical models. Our approach provides advances in the development of treatment strategies for pediatric AML.",

        "abstract": "A novel method using UPLC with tandem mass-spectrometric detection (UPLC-MS/MS) with positive electrospray ionization was developed for the detection of the antiarrhythmic drug, dofetilide, in mouse plasma and urine. Protein precipitation was performed on 10\u2009\u03bcL of plasma and 2\u2009\u03bcL of urine samples using dofetilide-D4 as an internal standard, and separation of the analyte was accomplished on a C18 analytical column with the flow of 0.40\u2009mL/min. Subsequently, the method was successfully applied to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of dofetilide following oral and intravenous administration. The calibration curve was linear over the selected concentration range (R \u2265 0.99), with a lower limit of quantitation of 5\u2009ng/mL. The intra-day and inter-day precisions, and accuracies obtained from a 5-day validation ranged from 3.00 to 7.10%, 3.80-7.20%, and 93.0-106% for plasma, and 3.50-9.00%, 3.70-10.0%, 87.0-106% for urine, while the recovery of dofetilide was 93.7% and 97.4% in plasma and urine, respectively. The observed pharmacokinetic profiles revealed that absorption is the rate-limiting step in dofetilide distribution and elimination. Pharmacokinetic studies illustrate that the absolute bioavailability of dofetilide in the FVB strain mice is 34.5%. The current developed method allows for accurate and precise quantification of dofetilide in micro-volumes of plasma and urine, and was found to be suitable for supporting in vivo pharmacokinetic studies.",

In the current study, genome-wide miRNA-Seq and mRNA profiles in 318 LIHC patients derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analysed to identify miRNA-based signatures for LIHC prognosis with survival analysis and a semi-supervised principal components (SPC) method. A seven-miRNA signature was confirmed for overall survival (OS) prediction by comparing miRNA profiles in paired primary tumour and solid tumour normal tissues. Thereafter, a linear prognostic model that consisted of seven miRNAs was established and used to divide patients into high- and low-risk groups according to prognostic scores. Subsequent Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the seven-miRNA signature correlated with a good predictive clinical outcome for 5-year survival in LIHC patients. Additionally, this miRNA-based prognostic model could also be used for OS prognosis of LIHC patients in early stages, which could guide the future therapy of those patients and promote the OS rate. Moreover, the seven-miRNA signature was an independent prognostic factor. In conclusion, this signature may serve as a prognostic biomarker and guide LIHC therapy, and it could even be used as an LIHC therapeutic target in the future.",

In the current study, we aimed to uncover gene signatures and key pathways during HCC. Gene expression profiles of GSE26485 were downloaded from GEO database. Totally, 101 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were up-regulated and 146 ones were down-regulated. Biological processes (BP) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) analysis showed that the DEGs were mainly enriched in regulation of cell growth, oxidation-reduction process, mitotic cytokinesis, negative regulation of macroautophagy, endosome organization, lysosome, biosynthesis of antibiotics, small cell lung cancer and glutathione metabolism and so on (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, Kaplan-Meier, log-rank method, western blot, immunohistochemistry and encyclopedia of DNA elements (ENCODE) analysis showed that CSN5 depletion took effects through down-regulation of SMAD5-related pathways which include EXO1, CENPA and NCAPG, resulting in the inactivation of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3. Those genes represent the promising targets for therapeutic intervention in HCC patients.",

Diagnosis of IFTA-I accurately and early is critical to prevent graft failure and improve graft survival. In the current study, through analyzing the renal allograft biopsy in patients with stable function after kidney transplantation (STA), IFTA and IFTA-I group with semi-supervised principal components methods, we found that CD2, IL7R, CCL5 based signature could not only distinguish STA and IFTA-I well, but predict IFTA-I with a high degree of accuracy with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 ( = 0.00023). Additionally, IRF8 demonstrated significant differences among STA, IFTA and IFTA-I groups, suggesting that IRF8 had the capacity to discriminate the different classifications of graft biopsies well. Also, with Kaplan-Meier and log-rank methods, we found that IRF8 could serve as the prognostic marker for renal graft failure in those biopsies without rejection (AUC = 0.75) and the recipients expressing high had a higher risk for renal graft loss ( < 0.0001). This research may provide new targets for therapeutic prevention and intervention for post-transplantation IFTA with or with inflammation.",

During the development of embryos, ncRNAs, such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), have been widely proven as key regulators. The emerging single-cell RNA sequencing technique is powerful for profiling \"cell-to-cell\" variability at the genomic level. It has been applied to detect the expression of ncRNAs during embryo development. In this chapter, we pay close attention to single-cell ncRNA expression and summarize their roles in embryo development.",

The NLRP3 inflammasome plays an important role in the maturation of IL-1 and the inflammatory cascade. Here, we established a model of SAP using wild-type (NLRP3) and NLRP3 knockout (NLRP3) mice by intraperitoneal injections of caerulein (Cae) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Pathological injury to the pancreas and lungs, the inflammatory response, and neutrophil infiltration were significantly mitigated in NLRP3 mice. Furthermore, INF-39, an NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, could reduce the severity of SAP and P-ALI in a dose-dependent manner. Our results suggested that SAP and P-ALI were alleviated by NLRP3 deficiency in mice, and thus, reducing NLRP3 expression may mitigate SAP-associated inflammation and P-ALI.",

        "abstract": "Layer-by-layer (LbL) assemblies of polyvinylamine with grafted TEMPO moieties (PVAm-T) with sodium polystyrenesulfonate (PSS) were prepared on gold-sulfonate surfaces, and the redox properties were measured by cyclic voltammetry. LbL compositions were probed by quartz crystal microbalance (wet) and ellipsometric (dry) film measurements. Approximately 30% of the TEMPO moieties in the LbL assemblies were redox-active when the total TEMPO coverage was varied up to 6 \u03bcmol/m, by either varying the TEMPO content in PVAm-T or by varying the number of LbL bilayers. Three non-redox-active PVAm/PSS blocking bilayers were required to prevent the electrode from oxidizing PVAm-T in the exterior LbL layer. This suggests significant intermixing between the layers in the LbL film. In addition to contributing to the small but growing body of work on redox polymers based on grafted TEMPO, this work serves as a reference point for understanding the redox properties of colloidal PVAm-T-laccase complexes in future work.",

For DS values u003e10%, all of the TEMPOs in the hydrogel film were redox-active in that they could be oxidized by the electrode. With hydrogel layers made with lower-DS PVAm-Ts, only about half of the TEMPOs were redox-active; 10% DS appears to be a percolation threshold for complete TEMPO-to-TEMPO electron transport. In parallel experiments with hydrogel complexes adsorbed onto regenerated cellulose films, the aldehyde concentrations increased monotonically with the density of redox-active TEMPO moieties in the adsorbed hydrogel. The maximum density of aldehydes was 0.2...",

        "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been reported to participate in CRC progression. In the present study, we observed downregulation of miR-218 and upregulation of YEATS domain containing\u00a04 (YEATS4) in CRC tissues and in multidrug-resistant HCT-116/L-OHP cells compared with these levels in normal tissues and parental HCT-116 cells, respectively. The results indicated that miR-218 overexpression significantly decreased the IC50 value of oxaliplatin (L-OHP) in the HCT-116/L-OHP cells, and suppression of miR-218 significantly enhanced the IC50 of L-OHP in the HCT-116 cells. Flow cytometric analysis showed that miR-218 overexpression alone promoted cell apoptosis in the HCT-116/L-OHP cells, which was further enhanced in response to L-OHP, and miR-218 inhibition decreased cell apoptosis in the HCT-116 cells following treatment with L-OHP. Western blot analysis indicated that, compared with the small increase observed in HCT-116 cells, the relative LC3\u00a0II level in HCT-116/L-OHP cells after lysosome inhibition via chloroquine (CQ) was markedly upregulated following L-OHP treatment, suggesting induction of autophagy. Exposure of HCT-116/L-OHP cells to L-OHP after control mimic transfection increased autophagic flux, as reflected by increased LC3\u00a0II levels, while miR-218 overexpression partly reversed L-OHP-mediated LC3\u00a0II accumulation. Additionally, both miR-218 overexpression and CQ treatment promoted L-OHP-induced HCT-116/L-OHP cell apoptosis. Molecularly, our results confirmed that miR-218 directly targets the YEATS4 gene and inhibits YEATS4 expression. Furthermore, YEATS4 overexpression without the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) restored miR-218-inhibited YEATS4 and LC3\u00a0II expression, and abolished miR-218-stimulated cell viability loss and cell apoptosis increase in response to L-OHP. In conclusion, miR-218 sensitized HCT-116/L-OHP cells to L-OHP-induced cell apoptosis via inhibition of cytoprotective autophagy by targeting YEATS4 expression.",

        "abstract": "Chemoresistance is a major obstacle to cancer therapy including that of colon cancer (CC). Although the dysregulation of many miRNAs has been implicated in 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance in CC cells, the specific role of miR-20b in chemoresistance has not been documented. In the present study, we first determined the expression of miR-20b by RT-PCR and the levels of a\u00a0disintegrin and metalloprotease\u00a09 (ADAM9) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by western blotting in CC and adjacent non-cancerous tissues from 5-FU-sensitive or -resistant CC patients. Subsequently, 5-FU-sensitive (HCT116) and -resistant (HCT116-R) cells were obtained, and the levels of miR-20b, ADAM9 and EGFR were detected. Meanwhile, the 5-FU resistance of the cells was examined by assessing cell viability (by MTT assay) and apoptosis (by flow cytometry). After transfection of miR-20b into HCT116-R cells, drug resistance was reexamined. We then confirmed the relationship between miR-20b and ADAM9 by luciferase reporter assay. Finally, 5-FU resistance in HCT116 and HCT116-R cells was compared after transfection with miR-20b. Our results showed that miR-20b was expressed at lower levels in the 5-FU-resistant tissues and cells than in the 5-FU-sensitive tissues and cells. The opposite was the case for expression of ADAM9 and EGFR. In addition, we demonstrated that ADAM9 is a direct target of miR-20b and that miR-20b decreased the 5-FU resistance of HCT116-R cells. Our findings suggest that miR-20b reduces 5-FU resistance to induce apoptosis in\u00a0vitro by suppressing ADAM9/EGFR in CC cells.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a setup for measuring the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical resistivity of bulk thermoelectric materials. The sample holder was designed to have a compact structure and can be directly mounted in a standard cryostat system for temperature-dependent measurements. For the Seebeck coefficient measurement, a thin bar-shaped sample is mounted bridging two copper bases; and two ceramic heaters are used to generate a temperature gradient along the sample. Two type T thermocouples are used to determine both temperature and voltage differences between two widely separated points on the sample. The thermocouple junction is flattened into a disk and pressed onto the sample surface by using a spring load. The flexible fixation method we adopted not only simplifies the sample mounting process but also prevents thermal contact deterioration due to the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients between the sample and other parts. With certain modifications, the sample holder can also be used for four-probe electrical resistivity measurements. High temperature measurements are essential for thermoelectric power generation. The experimental system we developed is capable of measuring the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical resistivity of bulk thermoelectric materials in a wide temperature range from 80 to 500 K, which can be further extended to even higher temperatures. Measurements on two standard materials, constantan and nickel, confirmed the accuracy and the reliability of the system.",

        "abstract": "This work reports a thermal transport study in quasi-one-dimensional organic nanostructures self-assembled from conjugated planar molecules via \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. Thermal resistances of single crystalline copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) nanoribbons are measured via a suspended thermal bridge method. We experimentally observed the deviation from the linear length dependence for the thermal resistance of single crystalline \u03b2-phase CuPc nanoribbons, indicating possible subdiffusion thermal transport. Interestingly, a gradual transition to the linear length dependence is observed with the increase of the lateral dimensions of CuPc nanoribbons. The measured thermal resistance of single crystalline CuPc nanoribbons shows an increasing trend with temperature. However, the trend of temperature dependence of thermal resistance is reversed after electron irradiation, i.e., decreasing with temperature, indicating that the single crystalline CuPc nanoribbons become 'amorphous'. Similar behavior is also observed for PTCDI nanoribbons after electron irradiation, proving that the electron beam can induce amorphization of single crystalline self-assembled nanostructures of planar \u03c0-conjugated molecules. The measured thermal resistance of the 'amorphous' CuPc nanoribbon demonstrates a roughly linear dependence on the nanoribbon length, suggesting that normal diffusion dominates thermal transport. ",

Herein, we reveal that the thermal conductivity of epoxy resin fibers increases on decreasing the fiber diameter and surpasses the bulk value (0.25 W m K at 300 K) for the fiber with a diameter of 211 nm. The variation of thermal conductivity in epoxy resin fibers can likely be attributed to their microstructure change-enhanced interface phonon scattering between amorphous and crystalline regions and the enhanced alignment of the molecular chain orientation.",

        "abstract": "In this work, fullerene (C60) nanorods were prepared by a surfactant-assisted self-assembly method. Although the orientation of molecular alignment remains unchanged from one end to the other end in these C60 nanorods, they cannot be rigorously treated as single crystals because of the existence of amorphous-like regions formed by a high density of defects such as stacking faults and vacancy clusters. The partially crystalline and partially amorphous structure results in unusual thermal transport behavior in C60 nanorods, which cannot be classified into either typical crystalline-like or typical glass-like behavior. The thermal resistances of the C60 nanorods decrease with increasing temperature and reach a plateau around 100 K, which can be attributed to the combined effect of Einstein localized vibration in C60 molecules, intracluster vibration, and phonon-defect scattering. Accompanied with depositing Pt/C composites at two ends of a C60 nanorod to improve thermal contact between Pt electrodes and the C60 nanorod, tensile strain may be introduced in the C60 nanorod due to contraction, which enhances thermal resistance, especially in the low temperature range. Ultralow thermal conductivity (less than 0.06 W m\u22121 K\u22121) is observed for self-assembled C60 nanorods at room temperature, which is significantly lower than the thermal conductivity of bulk C60 single crystals and polycrystalline C60/C70 compacts but on the same order of magnitude as the lower limit of thermal conductivity of amorphous carbon.",

        "abstract": "Despite being a well-established research method, the use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for routine molecular typing and pathogen characterization remains a substantial challenge due to the required bioinformatics resources and/or expertise. Moreover, many national reference laboratories and centers, as well as other laboratories working under a quality system, require extensive validation to demonstrate that employed methods are \"fit-for-purpose\" and provide high-quality results. A harmonized framework with guidelines for the validation of WGS workflows does currently, however, not exist yet, despite several recent case studies highlighting the urgent need thereof. We present a validation strategy focusing specifically on the exhaustive characterization of the bioinformatics analysis of a WGS workflow designed to replace conventionally employed molecular typing methods for microbial isolates in a representative small-scale laboratory, using the pathogen  as a proof-of-concept. We adapted several classically employed performance metrics specifically toward three different bioinformatics assays: resistance gene characterization (based on the ARG-ANNOT, ResFinder, CARD, and NDARO databases), several commonly employed typing schemas (including, among others, core genome multilocus sequence typing), and serogroup determination. We analyzed a core validation dataset of 67 well-characterized samples typed by means of classical genotypic and/or phenotypic methods that were sequenced in-house, allowing to evaluate repeatability, reproducibility, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity of the different bioinformatics assays. We also analyzed an extended validation dataset composed of publicly available WGS data for 64 samples by comparing results of the different bioinformatics assays against results obtained from commonly used bioinformatics tools. We demonstrate high performance, with values for all performance metrics >87%, >97%, and >90% for the resistance gene characterization, sequence typing, and serogroup determination assays, respectively, for both validation datasets. Our WGS workflow has been made publicly available as a \"push-button\" pipeline for Illumina data at https://galaxy.sciensano.be to showcase its implementation for non-profit and/or academic usage. Our validation strategy can be adapted to other WGS workflows for other pathogens of interest and demonstrates the added value and feasibility of employing WGS with the aim of being integrated into routine use in an applied public health setting.",

        "abstract": "Despite being a well-established research method, the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) for routine molecular typing and pathogen characterization remains a substantial challenge due to the required bioinformatics resources and/or expertise. Moreover, many national reference laboratories and centers, as well as other laboratories working under a quality system, require extensive validation to demonstrate that employed methods are \u2018fit-for-purpose\u2019 and provide high-quality results. A harmonized framework with guidelines for the validation of WGS workflows does currently however not exit yet, despite several recent case studies highlighting the urgent need thereof. We present a validation strategy focusing specifically on the exhaustive characterization of the bioinformatics analysis of a WGS workflow designed to replace conventionally employed molecular typing methods for microbial isolates in a representative small-scale laboratory, using the pathogen Neisseria meningitidis as a proof-of-concept. We adapted several classically employed performance metrics specifically towards three different bioinformatics assays: resistance gene characterization (based on the ARG-ANNOT, ResFinder, CARD, and NDARO databases), several commonly employed typing schemas (including, amongst others, core genome multilocus sequence typing), and serogroup determination. We analyzed a core validation dataset of 67 well-characterized samples typed by means of classical genotypic and/or phenotypic methods that were sequenced in-house, allowing to evaluate repeatability, reproducibility, accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity of the different bioinformatics assays. We also analyzed an extended validation dataset composed of publicly available WGS data for 64 samples by comparing results of the different bioinformatics assays against results obtained from commonly used bioinformatics tools. We demonstrate high performance, with values for all performance metrics u003e87%, u003e97%, and u003e90% for the resistance gene characterization, sequence typing, and serogroup determination assays, respectively, for both validation datasets. Our WGS workflow has been made publicly available as a \u2018push-button\u2019 pipeline for Illumina data at https://galaxy.sciensano.be to showcase its implementation for non-profit and/or academic usage. Our validation strategy can be adapted to other WGS workflows for other pathogens of interest, and demonstrates the added value and feasibility of employing WGS with the aim of being integrated into routine use in an applied public health setting.",

        "abstract": "A new design strategy to tune emission color of aggregation-induced emission (AIE) Ir(III) complexes, by simply adjusting the strength of donor/acceptor on ancillary ligands, is reported. Herein, all studied Ir(III) complexes employ 1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-1H-pyrazole as cyclometalated ligands but different pyridine-1,2,4-triazolyl moieties as ancillary ligands that were modified with carbazole end-capped alkyl groups, in which pyridine-1,2,4-triazolyl moieties and functionalized carbazole act as donor and acceptor units, respectively. The experimental and theoretical results clearly reveal the intrinsic relationship between structures and emission behaviors. Enhancing the ability of donor and/or acceptor leads to red-shifted emission and vice versa. In addition, one of the designed dyes exhibits the reversible and significant mechanochromic luminescent behavior thanks to its efficient AIE characteristic and structural modification, providing a feasible way to design multifunctional materials.",

        "abstract": "A clear relationship between structures and desired properties is a crucial factor for further material design with diverse structure and performance optimization. Herein, a new design strategy to achieve efficient mechanochromism of Ir(III) complexes has been described by deeply exploring the photophysical properties of a series of cationic Ir(III) phosphors that contain the same main ligands but easily tunable donor\u2013acceptor type ancillary ligands. All designed phosphors exhibit intense emissions in solid states due to intrinsic aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics. By simply tuning the donor moieties on ancillary ligands, controllable and naked-eye visible mechanochromic luminescence behavior has been successfully realized. Compared with previous works, this design strategy reported herein is more simple and feasible. Subtle modification of the donor groups on ancillary ligands leads to obvious changes in the dipole moments. The larger the dipole moments, the more efficient is the mechanochromism for such a studied system. Benefiting from the prominent and reversible mechanochromism as well as intense emission in the aggregation state, an efficient data encryption device and a sensitive explosive probe towards 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) are achieved.",
