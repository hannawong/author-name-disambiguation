        "abstract": "The recently discovered complete ammonia-oxidizing (comammox) bacteria are occurring in various environments, including wastewater treatment plants. To better understand their role in micropollutant biotransformation in comparison with ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), we investigated the biotransformation capability of  (the only comammox isolate) for 17 micropollutants. Asulam, fenhexamid, mianserin, and ranitidine were biotransformed by ,  (AOA) and  Nm90 (AOB). More distinctively, carbendazim, a benzimidazole fungicide, was exclusively biotransformed by . The biotransformation of carbendazim only occurred when  was supplied with ammonia but not nitrite as the energy source. The exclusive biotransformation of carbendazim by  was likely enabled by an enhanced substrate promiscuity of its unique AMO and its much higher substrate (for ammonia) affinity compared with the other two ammonia oxidizers. One major plausible transformation product (TP) of carbendazim is a hydroxylated form at the aromatic ring, which is consistent with the function of AMO. These findings provide fundamental knowledge on the micropollutant degradation potential of a comammox bacterium, to better understand the fate of micropollutants in nitrifying environments.",

        "abstract": "The discovery of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) of the phylum Thaumarchaeota and the high abundance of archaeal ammonia monooxygenase subunit A encoding gene sequences in many environments have extended our perception of nitrifying microbial communities. Moreover, AOA are the only aerobic ammonia oxidizers known to be active in geothermal environments. Molecular data indicate that in many globally distributed terrestrial high-temperature habits a thaumarchaeotal lineage within the Nitrosopumilus cluster (also called \"marine\" group I.1a) thrives, but these microbes have neither been isolated from these systems nor functionally characterized in situ yet. In this study, we report on the enrichment and genomic characterization of a representative of this lineage from a thermal spring in Kamchatka. This thaumarchaeote, provisionally classified as \"Candidatus Nitrosotenuis uzonensis\", is a moderately thermophilic, non-halophilic, chemolithoautotrophic ammonia oxidizer. The nearly complete genome sequence (assembled into a single scaffold) of this AOA confirmed the presence of the typical thaumarchaeotal pathways for ammonia oxidation and carbon fixation, and indicated its ability to produce coenzyme F420 and to chemotactically react to its environment. Interestingly, like members of the genus Nitrosoarchaeum, \"Candidatus N. uzonensis\" also possesses a putative artubulin-encoding gene. Genome comparisons to related AOA with available genome sequences confirmed that the newly cultured AOA has an average nucleotide identity far below the species threshold and revealed a substantial degree of genomic plasticity with unique genomic regions in \"Ca. N. uzonensis\", which potentially include genetic determinants of ecological niche differentiation.",

        "abstract": "Uncultivated Nitrospira-like bacteria in different biofilm and activated-sludge samples were investigated by cultivation-independent molecular approaches. Initially, the phylogenetic affiliation of Nitrospira-like bacteria in a nitrifying biofilm was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Subsequently, a phylogenetic consensus tree of the Nitrospira phylum including all publicly available sequences was constructed. This analysis revealed that the genus Nitrospira consists of at least four distinct sublineages. Based on these data, two 16S rRNA-directed oligonucleotide probes specific for the phylum and genus Nitrospira, respectively, were developed and evaluated for suitability for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The probes were used to investigate the in situ architecture of cell aggregates of Nitrospira-like nitrite oxidizers in wastewater treatment plants by FISH, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and computer-aided three-dimensional visualization. Cavities and a network of cell-free channels inside the Nitrospira microcolonies were detected that were water permeable, as demonstrated by fluorescein staining. The uptake of different carbon sources by Nitrospira-like bacteria within their natural habitat under different incubation conditions was studied by combined FISH and microautoradiography. Under aerobic conditions, the Nitrospira-like bacteria in bioreactor samples took up inorganic carbon (as HCO(3)(-) or as CO(2)) and pyruvate but not acetate, butyrate, and propionate, suggesting that these bacteria can grow mixotrophically in the presence of pyruvate. In contrast, no uptake by the Nitrospira-like bacteria of any of the carbon sources tested was observed under anoxic or anaerobic conditions.",

        "abstract": "Nitrification is a core process in the global nitrogen cycle that is essential for the functioning of many ecosystems. The discovery of autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) within the phylum Thaumarchaeota has changed our perception of the microbiology of nitrification, in particular since their numerical dominance over ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in many environments has been revealed. These and other data have led to a widely held assumption that all amoA-encoding members of the Thaumarchaeota (AEA) are autotrophic nitrifiers. In this study, 52 municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants were screened for the presence of AEA and AOB. Thaumarchaeota carrying amoA were detected in high abundance only in four industrial plants. In one plant, thaumarchaeotes closely related to soil group I.1b outnumbered AOB up to 10,000-fold, and their numbers, which can only be explained by active growth in this continuous culture system, were two to three orders of magnitude higher than could be sustained by autotrophic ammonia oxidation. Consistently, (14)CO(2) fixation could only be detected in AOB but not in AEA in actively nitrifying sludge from this plant via FISH combined with microautoradiography. Furthermore, in situ transcription of archaeal amoA, and very weak in situ labeling of crenarchaeol after addition of (13)CO(2), was independent of the addition of ammonium. These data demonstrate that some amoA-carrying group I.1b Thaumarchaeota are not obligate chemolithoautotrophs.",

        "abstract": "The ecophysiology of microorganisms has been at the heart of microbial ecology since its early days, but only during the past decade have methods become available for cultivation-independent, direct identification of microorganisms in complex communities and for the simultaneous investigation of their activity and substrate uptake patterns. The combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and microautoradiography (MAR) is currently the most widely applied tool for revealing physiological properties of microorganisms in their natural environment with single-cell resolution. For example, this technique has been used in wastewater treatment and marine systems to describe the functional properties of newly discovered species, and to identify microorganisms responsible for key physiological processes. Recently, the scope of FISH-MAR was extended by rendering it quantitative and by combining it with microelectrode measurements or stable isotope probing. Isotope arrays have also been developed that exploit the parallel detection offered by DNA microarrays to measure incorporation of labelled substrate into the rRNA of many community members in a single experiment.",

Therefore, the study of wastewater microorganisms has obvious applied significance; however, the importance of wastewater treatment reactors as model systems for microbial ecology is often overlooked. Modern molecular techniques, including environmental genomics, have identified unexpected microbial key players for nutrient removal and sludge bulking and/or foaming, and provided many exciting insights into the diversity, functions and niche differentiations of these predominantly uncultivated microorganisms. It is now time for wastewater microbiology to be recognized as a mature and dynamic discipline in its own right, offering much toward a deeper understanding of life in complex microbial communities. Here, we consider selected key findings to illustrate the past and future roles of molecular ecophysiology and genomics in the development of wastewater microbiology as an important subdiscipline of microbial ecology.",

        "abstract": "Nitrous oxide (NO) and nitric oxide (NO) are atmospheric trace gases that contribute to climate change and affect stratospheric and ground-level ozone concentrations. Ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) are key players in the nitrogen cycle and major producers of NO and NO globally. However, nothing is known about NO and NO production by the recently discovered and widely distributed complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox). Here, we show that the comammox bacterium Nitrospira inopinata is sensitive to inhibition by an NO scavenger, cannot denitrify to NO, and emits NO at levels that are comparable to AOA but much lower than AOB. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NO formed by N. inopinata formed under varying oxygen regimes originates from abiotic conversion of hydroxylamine. Our findings indicate that comammox microbes may produce less NO during nitrification than AOB.",

        "abstract": "Thaumarchaeota range among the most abundant archaea on Earth. Initially classified as 'mesophilic Crenarchaeota', comparative genomics has recently revealed that they form a separate and deep-branching phylum within the Archaea. This novel phylum comprises in 16S rRNA gene trees not only all known archaeal ammonia oxidizers but also several clusters of environmental sequences representing microorganisms with unknown energy metabolism. Ecophysiological studies of ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota suggest adaptation to low ammonia concentrations and an autotrophic or possibly mixotrophic lifestyle. Extrapolating from the wide substrate range of copper-containing membrane-bound monooxygenases, to which the thaumarchaeal ammonia monooxygenases belong, the use of substrates other than ammonia for generating energy by some members of the Thaumarchaeota seems likely.",

        "abstract": "Numerous past studies have shown members of the genus Nitrospira to be the predominant nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) in nitrifying wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Only recently, the novel NOB 'Candidatus Nitrotoga arctica' was identified in permafrost soil and a close relative was enriched from activated sludge. Still, little is known about diversity, distribution and functional importance of Nitrotoga in natural and engineered ecosystems. Here we developed Nitrotoga 16S rRNA-specific PCR primers and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes, which were applied to screen activated sludge samples from 20 full-scale WWTPs. Nitrotoga-like bacteria were detected by PCR in 11 samples and reached abundances detectable by FISH in seven sludges. They coexisted with Nitrospira in most of these WWTPs, but constituted the only detectable NOB in two systems. Quantitative FISH revealed that Nitrotoga accounted for nearly 2% of the total bacterial community in one of these plants, a number comparable to Nitrospira abundances in other WWTPs. Spatial statistics revealed that Nitrotoga coaggregated with ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, strongly supporting a functional role in nitrite oxidation. This activity was confirmed by FISH in combination with microradiography, which revealed nitrite-dependent autotrophic carbon fixation by Nitrotoga in situ. Correlation of the presence or absence with WWTP operational parameters indicated low temperatures as a main factor supporting high Nitrotoga abundances, although in incubation experiments these NOB remained active over an unexpected range of temperatures, and also at different ambient nitrite concentrations. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that Nitrotoga can be functionally important nitrite oxidizers in WWTPs and can even represent the only known NOB in engineered systems.",

        "abstract": "Human inflammatory bowel disease and experimental colitis models in mice are associated with shifts in intestinal microbiota composition, but it is unclear at what taxonomic/phylogenetic level such microbiota dynamics can be indicative for health or disease. Here, we report that dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis is accompanied by major shifts in the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota of STAT1(-/-) and wild-type mice, as determined by 454 pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA (gene) amplicons, metatranscriptomics and quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization of selected phylotypes. The bacterial families Ruminococcaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Deferribacteraceae and Verrucomicrobiaceae increased in relative abundance in DSS-treated mice. Comparative 16S rRNA sequence analysis at maximum possible phylogenetic resolution identified several indicator phylotypes for DSS treatment, including the putative mucin degraders Akkermansia and Mucispirillum. The analysis additionally revealed strongly contrasting abundance changes among phylotypes of the same family, particularly within the Lachnospiraceae. These extensive phylotype-level dynamics were hidden when reads were grouped at higher taxonomic levels. Metatranscriptomic analysis provided insights into functional shifts in the murine intestinal microbiota, with increased transcription of genes associated with regulation and cell signaling, carbohydrate metabolism and respiration and decreased transcription of flagellin genes during inflammation. These findings (i) establish the first in-depth inventory of the mouse gut microbiota and its metatranscriptome in the DSS colitis model, (ii) reveal that family-level microbial community analyses are insufficient to reveal important colitis-associated microbiota shifts and (iii) support a scenario of shifting intra-family structure and function in the phylotype-rich and phylogenetically diverse Lachnospiraceae in DSS-treated mice.",

        "abstract": "Globally distributed archaea comprising ammonia oxidizers of moderate terrestrial and marine environments are considered the most abundant archaeal organisms on Earth. Based on 16S rRNA phylogeny, initial assignment of these archaea was to the Crenarchaeota. By contrast, features of the first genome sequence from a member of this group suggested that they belong to a novel phylum, the Thaumarchaeota. Here, we re-investigate the Thaumarchaeota hypothesis by including two newly available genomes, that of the marine ammonia oxidizer Nitrosopumilus maritimus and that of Nitrososphaera gargensis, a representative of another evolutionary lineage within this group predominantly detected in terrestrial environments. Phylogenetic studies based on r-proteins and other core genes, as well as comparative genomics, confirm the assignment of these organisms to a separate phylum and reveal a Thaumarchaeota-specific set of core informational processing genes, as well as potentially ancestral features of the archaea.",

        "abstract": "Acute colitis causes alterations in the intestinal microbiota, but the microbiota is thought to recover after such events. Extreme microbiota alterations are characteristic of human chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, although alterations reported in different studies are divergent and sometimes even contradictory. To better understand the impact of periodic disturbances on the intestinal microbiota and its compositional difference between acute and relapsing colitis, we investigated the beginnings of recurrent inflammation using the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) mouse model of chemically induced colitis. Using bacterial 16S rRNA gene-targeted pyrosequencing as well as quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization, we profiled the intestinal and stool microbiota of mice over the course of three rounds of DSS-induced colitis and recovery. We found that characteristic inflammation-associated microbiota could be detected in recovery-phase mice. Successive inflammation episodes further drove the microbiota into an increasingly altered composition post-inflammation, and signatures of colitis history were detectable in the microbiota more sensitively than by pathology analysis. Bacterial indicators of murine colitis history were identified in intestinal and stool samples, with a high degree of consistency between both sample types. Stool may therefore be a promising non-invasive source of bacterial biomarkers that are highly sensitive to inflammation state and history. ",

        "abstract": "The abilities of three phylogenetically distant ammonia oxidizers, Nitrososphaera gargensis, an ammonia-oxidizing archaeon (AOA); Nitrosomomas nitrosa Nm90, an ammonia-oxidizing bacterium (AOB); and Nitrospira inopinata, the only complete ammonia oxidizer (comammox) available as a pure culture, to biotransform seven sulfonamides (SAs) were investigated. The removals and protein-normalized biotransformation rate constants indicated that the AOA strain N.\u00a0gargensis exhibited the highest SA biotransformation rates, followed by N.\u00a0inopinata and N.\u00a0nitrosa Nm90. The transformation products (TPs) of sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfamethazine (SMZ) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and the biotransformation mechanisms were evaluated. Based on the analysis of the TP formulas and approximate structures, it was found that during biotransformation, i) the AOA strain carried out SA deamination, hydroxylation, and nitration; ii) the AOB strain mainly performed SA deamination; and iii) the comammox isolate participated only in deamination reactions. It is proposed that deamination was catalyzed by deaminases while hydroxylation and nitration were mediated by nonspecific activities of the ammonia monooxygenase (AMO). Additionally, it was demonstrated that among the three ammonia oxidizers, only AOB contributed to the formation of pterin-SA conjugates. The biotransformation of SDZ, SMZ and SMX occurred only when ammonia oxidation was active, suggesting a cometabolic transformation mechanism. Interestingly, SAs could also be transformed by hydroxylamine, an intermediate of ammonia oxidation, suggesting that in addition to enzymatic conversions, a microbially induced abiotic mechanism contributes to SA transformation during ammonia oxidation. Overall, using experiments with pure cultures, this study provides important insights into the roles played by ammonia oxidizers in SA biotransformation.",

We show that C. polyspora is a gammaproteobacterium closely related to methanotrophs and capable of oxidizing methane. We discovered that C. polyspora encodes a phylogenetically very unusual particulate methane monooxygenase whose expression is strongly increased in the presence of methane. Our findings demonstrate a previously unrecognized complexity of the evolutionary history and cell biology of methane-oxidizing bacteria.",

However, only one pure isolate of this group from a marine environment has so far been obtained, demonstrating archaeal ammonia oxidation coupled with autotrophic growth similar to the bacterial counterparts. Here we describe the cultivation and isolation of an AOA from soil. It grows on ammonia or urea as an energy source and is capable of using higher ammonia concentrations than the marine isolate, Nitrosopumilus maritimus. Surprisingly, although it is able to grow chemolithoautotrophically, considerable growth rates of this strain are obtained only upon addition of low amounts of pyruvate or when grown in coculture with bacteria. Our findings expand the recognized metabolic spectrum of AOA and help explain controversial results obtained in the past on the activity and carbon assimilation of these globally distributed organisms.",

        "abstract": "Although alterations in gut microbiota composition during acute colitis have been repeatedly observed, associated functional changes and the recovery from dysbiosis received little attention. In this study, we investigated structure and function of the gut microbiota during acute inflammation and recovery in a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-colitis mouse model using metatranscriptomics, bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and monitoring of selected host markers. Parallel to an increase of host markers of inflammation during acute colitis, we observed relative abundance shifts and alterations in phylotype composition of the dominant bacterial orders Clostridiales and Bacteroidales, and an increase of the low abundant Enterobacteriales, Deferribacterales, Verrucomicrobiales and Erysipelotrichales. During recovery, the microbiota began to resume, but did not reach its original composition until the end of the experiment. Microbial gene expression was more resilient to disturbance, with pre-perturbation-type transcript profiles appearing quickly after acute colitis. The decrease of Clostridiales during inflammation correlated with a reduction of transcripts related to butyrate formation, suggesting a disturbance in host-microbe signalling and mucosal nutrient provision. The impact of acute inflammation on the Clostridiales was also characterized by a significant downregulation of their flagellin-encoding genes. In contrast, the abundance of members of the Bacteroidales increased along with an increase in transcripts related to mucin degradation. We propose that acute inflammation triggered a selective reaction of the immune system against flagella of commensals and temporarily altered murine microbiota composition and functions relevant for the host. Despite changes in specific interactions, the host-microbiota homeostasis revealed a remarkable ability for recovery.",

        "abstract": "Nitrospira are chemolithoautotrophic nitrite-oxidizing bacteria that catalyze the second step of nitrification in most oxic habitats and are important for excess nitrogen removal from sewage in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). To date, little is known about their diversity and ecological niche partitioning within complex communities. In this study, the fine-scale community structure and function of Nitrospira was analyzed in two full-scale WWTPs as model ecosystems. In Nitrospira-specific 16S rRNA clone libraries retrieved from each plant, closely related phylogenetic clusters (16S rRNA identities between clusters ranged from 95.8% to 99.6%) within Nitrospira lineages I and II were found. Newly designed probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) allowed the specific detection of several of these clusters, whose coexistence in the WWTPs was shown for prolonged periods of several years. In situ ecophysiological analyses based on FISH, relative abundance and spatial arrangement quantification, as well as microautoradiography revealed functional differences of these Nitrospira clusters regarding the preferred nitrite concentration, the utilization of formate as substrate and the spatial coaggregation with ammonia-oxidizing bacteria as symbiotic partners. Amplicon pyrosequencing of the nxrB gene, which encodes subunit beta of nitrite oxidoreductase of Nitrospira, revealed in one of the WWTPs as many as 121 species-level nxrB operational taxonomic units with highly uneven relative abundances in the amplicon library. These results show a previously unrecognized high diversity of Nitrospira in engineered systems, which is at least partially linked to niche differentiation and may have important implications for process stability.",

This assemblage contains organisms that possess dramatically different lifestyles and which colonize sharply contrasting habitats. Some members of this group are among the most successful human pathogens, others are abundant soil microbes, and others still are of major importance for the marine nitrogen cycle and hold much promise for sustainable wastewater treatment. Recent comparative genomic and metagenomic analyses of a few representatives of this group revealed many unusual features and generated unexpected hypotheses regarding their physiology, some of which have already been confirmed experimentally. Furthermore, the availability of these genome sequences offered new insights into the evolutionary history of this peculiar group of microbes with major medical, ecological and biotechnological relevance.",

We describe the design and optimization of this Raman-activated cell-sorting approach, illustrate its operation with four model bacteria (two intestinal, one soil and one marine) and demonstrate its high sorting accuracy (98.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7%), throughput (200-500\u2009cells\u2009h; 3.3-8.3\u2009cells\u2009min) and compatibility with cultivation. Application of this sorting approach for the metagenomic characterization of bacteria involved in mucin degradation in the mouse colon revealed a diverse consortium of bacteria, including several members of the underexplored family Muribaculaceae, highlighting both the complexity of this niche and the potential of Raman-activated cell sorting for identifying key players in targeted processes.",

        "abstract": "Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) catalyze the second step of nitrification, a major process of the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle, but the recognized diversity of this guild is surprisingly low and only two bacterial phyla contain known NOB. Here, we report on the discovery of a chemolithoautotrophic nitrite oxidizer that belongs to the widespread phylum Chloroflexi not previously known to contain any nitrifying organism. This organism, named Nitrolancetus hollandicus, was isolated from a nitrifying reactor. Its tolerance to a broad temperature range (25-63\u2009\u00b0C) and low affinity for nitrite (K(s)=1\u2009mM), a complex layered cell envelope that stains Gram positive, and uncommon membrane lipids composed of 1,2-diols distinguish N. hollandicus from all other known nitrite oxidizers. N. hollandicus grows on nitrite and CO(2), and is able to use formate as a source of energy and carbon. Genome sequencing and analysis of N. hollandicus revealed the presence of all genes required for CO(2) fixation by the Calvin cycle and a nitrite oxidoreductase (NXR) similar to the NXR forms of the proteobacterial nitrite oxidizers, Nitrobacter and Nitrococcus. Comparative genomic analysis of the nxr loci unexpectedly indicated functionally important lateral gene transfer events between Nitrolancetus and other NOB carrying a cytoplasmic NXR, suggesting that horizontal transfer of the NXR module was a major driver for the spread of the capability to gain energy from nitrite oxidation during bacterial evolution. The surprising discovery of N. hollandicus significantly extends the known diversity of nitrifying organisms and likely will have implications for future research on nitrification in natural and engineered ecosystems.",

        "abstract": "The obligately intracellular coccoid bacterium UWE25, a symbiont of Acanthamoeba spp., was previously identified as being related to chlamydiae based upon the presence of a chlamydia-like developmental cycle and its 16S rRNA gene sequence. Analysis of its complete genome sequence demonstrated that UWE25 shows many characteristic features of chlamydiae, including dependency on host-derived metabolites, composition of the cell envelope and the ability to thrive as an energy parasite within the cells of its eukaryotic host. Phylogenetic analysis of 44 ribosomal proteins further confirmed the affiliation of UWE25 to the 'Chlamydiae'. Within this phylum, UWE25 could be assigned to the family Parachlamydiaceae based on comparative analyses of the 16S rRNA, 23S rRNA and endoribonuclease P RNA genes. The distinct dissimilarities from its closest relative, Parachlamydia acanthamoebae Bn(9)(T) (7.1, 9.7 and 28.8%, respectively), observed in this analysis justify its classification in a new genus. Therefore, the name 'Candidatus Protochlamydia amoebophila' is proposed for the designation of the Acanthamoeba sp. symbiont UWE25 (=ATCC PRA-7).",

Cell counts were determined by a combination of in situ hybridization with fluorescently-labelled oligonucleotide probes and epifluorescence microscopy. Around 80% of total cells, as determined with the DNA specific fluorochrome DAPI, hybridized with a Bacteria specific probe. This indicated that the majority of microscopically visualized cells were indeed physiologically active. The samples of the municipal sewage plant were dominated by proteobacteria belonging to the beta-subclass, whereas small cells hybridizing with a cytophaga-flavobacterium-specific probe were most abundant in the batch reactor. Comparison of in situ microbial community structures and the heterotrophic saprophyte flora (analysed with standard cultivation techniques) resulted in major discrepancies. The nutrient rich medium favoured growth of gamma-subclass proteobacteria (e.g. Acinetobacter sp.) which were only a minor constituents (< 10%) of both sludge consortia. Dominating groups like the beta-subclass proteobacteria, the cytophagaflavobacteria cluster and the Gram-positive bacteria with a high G + C content of DNA were suppressed. These results suggest that the application of in situ hybridization techniques can yield a more complete understanding of the microbial populations involved in the purification of sewage.",

        "abstract": "Based on comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, two oligonucleotide probes for in situ detection of all members of the genus Listeria were designed. These probes allowed fast and reliable in situ detection of Listeria spp. even in complex samples like raw milk. Almost full-length iap (invasion-associated protein) gene sequences were determined for 69 Listeria monocytogenes strains of all 13 known serotypes. A comparison of these sequences revealed that the L. monocytogenes strains can be grouped into three distinct genotypes. These clusters correlate well with distinct serotypes. Thus, strains of serotypes b and d belong to genotype I, a and c to genotype II, and 4a and 4c, which are rarely isolated from humans, group together within genotype III. These results could be corroborated by further comparative sequence analysis of genes encoding two phospholipases - plcA and plcB. Based on the iap gene sequences, a highly specific and reproducible competitive PCR detection method was developed. Primer pairs targeting genotype-specific regions of the iap gene were designed. The amplification of non-specific PCR products from DNA of non-target strains was prevented by adding competitive primers. By applying this method, the rapid and reliable distinction of the three L. monocytogenes genotypes was possible.",

After staining the fresh flocs with fluorescein-isothiocyanate, 75 stacks of images (containing approx. 3000 flocs) were acquired with a confocal laser scanning microscope. The self-developed macro 3D volume and surface determination for the KS 400 software package combined the images of one stack to a 3D image and calculated the real floc volume and surface. We determined heterogeneity factors like the ratio of real floc surface to the surface of a sphere with the respective volume and the fractal dimension (D(f)). According to their significant influence on floc integrity and quality, we also investigated the chemical composition of flocs and quantified their bacterial population structure by using group-specific rRNA-targeted probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization. By a settling experiment we enriched flocs with poor settling properties and determined the above-mentioned parameters. This approach revealed shifts in floc volume, heterogeneity, and bacterial and chemical composition according to the settling quality of the flocs.",

        "abstract": "Wastewater treatment is a process of increasing importance in a world with an ever growing human population. Today, most wastewater treatment processes make use of the natural self-purification capacity of aquatic environments which is the result of the presence and action of microbial communities. Consequently, wastewater treatment facilities are designed to maintain high densities and activities of those microorganisms that satisfy the various purification demands. The performance, at least of large plants, has to be constantly monitored and is subject to strict regulation. Nevertheless, malfunctions resulting in decreased purification efficacy are frequent. This has, over the decades, prompted many microbiologists to compare the structure, dynamics and function of these `good' or `bad', but always complex, microbial communities. Part of these studies was targeted to a basic understanding of the various processes, another part, however, deals with the monitoring of community structure as a means to direct the plant operation towards higher elimination rates and overall stability. Even though the last decade has seen a molecular revolution in microbiology, the standard methods for monitoring wastewater treatment plants still rely on the tools available to the researcher at the beginning of this century, the microscope and agar plates. It is the goal of this MiniReview to compare the potential of the newly available molecular methods with the old monitoring techniques.",

A protocol for the in situ identification of Listeria spp. using fluorescently tagged, rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes was developed. Ethanol fixation and enzymatic pretreatment with lysozyme and proteinase K were used to optimize whole cell hybridization of exponential phase and stationary phase Listeria spp. cells. In parallel, transcript probes carrying multiple digoxigenin molecules were combined with anti-digoxigenin Fab antibody fragments labeled with horseradish peroxidase to detect, via the catalytic deposition of fluorescein-tyramide, the iap-mRNA in single Listeria monocytogenes cells. The iap gene encodes the associated virulence factor p60.

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to isolate bacteria with antimicrobial activities from the marine sponges Aplysina aerophoba and Aplysina cavernicola. The obtained 27 isolates could be subdivided into eight phylogenetically different clusters based on comparative sequence analysis of their 16S rDNA genes. The sponge isolates were affiliated with the low (Bacillus) and high G+C Gram-positive bacteria (Arthobacter, Micrococcus), as well as the alpha-Proteobacteria (unknown isolate) and gamma-Proteobacteria (Vibrio, Pseudoalteromonas). One novel Bacillus species was identified and two species were closely related to previously uncharacterized strains. Isolates with antimicrobial activity were numerically most abundant in the genera Pseudoalteromonas and the alpha-Proteobacteria. The sponge isolates show antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative reference strains but not against the fungus Candida albicans. A general pattern was observed in that Gram-positive bacteria inhibited Gram-positive strains while Gram-negative bacteria inhibited Gram-negative isolates. Antimicrobial activities were also found against clinical isolates, i.e. multi-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains isolated from hospital patients. The high recovery of strains with antimicrobial activity suggests that marine sponges represent an ecological niche which harbors a hitherto largely uncharacterized microbial diversity and, concomitantly, a yet untapped metabolic potential.",

        "abstract": "The composition of the microbial community present in the nitrifying-denitrifying activated sludge of an industrial wastewater treatment plant connected to a rendering facility was investigated by the full-cycle rRNA approach. After DNA extraction using three different methods, 94 almost full-length 16S rRNA gene clones were retrieved and analyzed phylogenetically. 59% of the clones were affiliated with the Proteobacteria and clustered with the beta- (29 clones), alpha- (24), and delta-class (2 clones), respectively. 15 clones grouped within the green nonsulfur (GNS) bacteria and 11 clones belonged to the Planctomycetes. The Verrucomicrobia, Acidobacteria, Nitrospira, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria were each represented by one to five clones. Interestingly, the highest 'species richness' [measured as number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs)] was found within the alpha-class of Proteobacteria, followed by the Planctomycetes, the beta-class of Proteobacteria, and the GNS-bacteria. The microbial community composition of the activated sludge was determined quantitatively by using 36 group-, subgroup-, and OTU-specific rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), confocal laser scanning microscopy and digital image analysis. 89% of all bacteria detectable by FISH with a bacterial probe set could be assigned to specific divisions. Consistent with the 16S rRNA gene library data, members of the beta-class of Proteobacteria dominated the microbial community and represented almost half of the biovolume of all bacteria detectable by FISH. Within the beta-class, 98% of the cells could be identified by the application of genus- or OTU-specific probes demonstrating a high in situ abundance of bacteria related to Zoogloea and Azoarcus sensu lato. Taken together, this study provides the first encompassing, high-resolution insight into the in situ composition of the microbial community present in a full-scale, industrial wastewater treatment plant.",

A protocol for the in situ identification of Listeria spp. using fluorescently tagged, rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes was developed. Ethanol fixation and enzymatic pretreatment with lysozyme and proteinase K were used to optimize whole cell hybridization of exponential phase and stationary phase Listeria spp. cells. In parallel, transcript probes carrying multiple digoxigenin molecules were combined with anti-digoxigenin Fab antibody fragments labeled with horseradish peroxidase to detect, via the catalytic deposition of fluorescein-tyramide, the iap-mRNA in single Listeria monocytogenes cells. The iap gene encodes the associated virulence factor p60. Application of the new signal amplification technique resulted in strong signals comparable in intensity to those obtained with fluorescently labeled rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes.",

        "abstract": "Protochlamydia amoebophila UWE25 is related to the Chlamydiaceae comprising major pathogens of humans, but thrives as obligate intracellular symbiont in the protozoan host Acanthamoeba sp. The genome of P. amoebophila encodes five paralogous carrier proteins belonging to the nucleotide transporter (NTT) family. Here we report on three P. amoebophila NTT isoforms, PamNTT2, PamNTT3 and PamNTT5, which possess several conserved amino acid residues known to be critical for nucleotide transport. We demonstrated that these carrier proteins are able to transport nucleotides, although substrate specificities and mode of transport differ in an unexpected manner and are unique among known NTTs. PamNTT2 is a counter exchange transporter exhibiting submillimolar apparent affinities for all four RNA nucleotides, PamNTT3 catalyses an unidirectional proton-coupled transport confined to UTP, whereas PamNTT5 mediates a proton-energized GTP and ATP import. All NTT genes of P. amoebophila are transcribed during intracellular multiplication in acanthamoebae. The biochemical characterization of all five NTT proteins from P. amoebophila in this and previous studies uncovered that these metabolically impaired bacteria are intimately connected with their host cell's metabolism in a surprisingly complex manner.",

        "abstract": "Adelgids (Insecta: Hemiptera: Adelgidae) are known as severe pests of various conifers in North America, Canada, Europe and Asia. Here, we present the first molecular identification of bacteriocyte-associated symbionts in these plant sap-sucking insects. Three geographically distant populations of members of the Adelges nordmannianae/piceae complex, identified based on coI and ef1alpha gene sequences, were investigated. Electron and light microscopy revealed two morphologically different endosymbionts, coccoid or polymorphic, which are located in distinct bacteriocytes. Phylogenetic analyses of their 16S and 23S rRNA gene sequences assigned both symbionts to novel lineages within the Gammaproteobacteria sharing <92% 16S rRNA sequence similarity with each other and showing no close relationship with known symbionts of insects. Their identity and intracellular location were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and the names \u2018Candidatus Steffania adelgidicola\u2019 and \u2018Candidatus Ecksteinia adelgidicola\u2019 are proposed for tentative classification. Both symbionts were present in all individuals of all investigated populations and in different adelgid life stages including eggs, suggesting vertical transmission from mother to offspring. An 85\u2009kb genome fragment of \u2018Candidatus S. adelgidicola\u2019 was reconstructed based on a metagenomic library created from purified symbionts. Genomic features including the frequency of pseudogenes, the average length of intergenic regions and the presence of several genes which are absent in other long-term obligate symbionts, suggested that \u2018Candidatus S. adelgidicola\u2019 is an evolutionarily young bacteriocyte-associated symbiont, which has been acquired after diversification of adelgids from their aphid sister group.",

These proteins catalyze the highly specific exchange of bacterial ADP against host ATP and thus allow bacteria to exploit their hosts' energy pool, a process also referred to as energy parasitism. The genome sequence of the obligate intracellular pathogen Lawsonia intracellularis (Deltaproteobacteria), responsible for one of the most economically important diseases in the swine industry worldwide, revealed the presence of a putative ATP/ADP translocase most similar to known ATP/ADP translocases of chlamydiae and rickettsiae (around 47% amino acid sequence identity). The gene coding for the putative ATP/ADP translocase of L. intracellularis (L. intracellularis nucleotide transporter 1 [NTT1(Li)]) was cloned and expressed in the heterologous host Escherichia coli. The transport properties of NTT1(Li) were determined by measuring the uptake of radioactively labeled substrates by E. coli. NTT1(Li) transported ATP in a counterexchange mode with ADP in a highly specific manner; the substrate affinities determined were 236.3 (+/- 36.5) microM for ATP and 275.2 (+/- 28.1) microM for ADP, identifying this protein as a functional ATP/ADP translocase. NTT1(Li) is the first ATP/ADP translocase from a bacterium not related to Chlamydiae or Rickettsiales, showing that energy parasitism by ATP/ADP translocases is more widespread than previously recognized. The occurrence of an ATP/ADP translocase in L. intracellularis is explained by a relatively recent horizontal gene transfer event with rickettsiae as donors.",

We showed that the ATP/ADP transport protein of the Parachlamydia-related endosymbiont of Acanthamoeba sp. strain UWE25, a recently identified relative of the important human pathogens Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydophila pneumoniae, is functional when expressed in the heterologous host Escherichia coli and demonstrated the presence of transcripts during the chlamydial developmental cycle. These findings indicate that the interaction between Parachlamydia-related endosymbionts and their amoeba hosts concerns energy parasitism similar to the interaction between pathogenic chlamydiae and their human host cells. Phylogenetic analysis of all known ATP/ADP translocases indicated that the genes encoding ATP/ADP translocases originated from a chlamydial ancestor and were, after an ancient gene duplication, transferred horizontally to rickettsiae and plants.",

        "abstract": "Bacteria living within eukaryotic cells can be essential for the survival or reproduction of the host1, 2 but in other cases are among the most successful pathogens3, 4. Environmental Chlamydiae, including strain UWE25, thrive as obligate intracellular symbionts within protozoa; are recently discovered relatives of major bacterial pathogens of humans; and also infect human cells4, 5, 6, 7. Genome analysis of UWE25 predicted that this symbiont is unable to synthesize the universal electron carrier nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)7. Compensation of limited biosynthetic capacity in intracellular bacteria is usually achieved by import of primary metabolites8, 9, 10, 11. Here, we report the identification of a candidate transporter protein from UWE25 that is highly specific for import of NAD+ when synthesized heterologously in Escherichia coli. The discovery of this candidate NAD+/ADP exchanger demonstrates that intact NAD+ molecules can be transported through cytoplasmic membranes. This protein acts together with a newly discovered nucleotide transporter and an ATP/ADP translocase12, and allows UWE25 to exploit its host cell by means of a sophisticated metabolic parasitism.",

They frequently contain obligate intracellular bacterial symbionts, which show a worldwide distribution. All Acanthamoeba spp. described so far harboured no or only a single specific endosymbiont phylotype, and in some cases evidence for coevolution between the symbiotic bacteria and the amoeba host has been reported. In this study we have isolated and characterized an Acanthamoeba sp. (strain OEW1) showing a stable symbiotic relationship with two morphologically different endosymbionts. 16S rRNA sequence analysis assigned these symbionts to the candidate genus Procabacter (Betaproteobacteria) and the genus Parachlamydia (Chlamydiae) respectively. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the affiliation of the endosymbionts and showed their co-occurrence in the amoeba host cells and their intracellular location within separate compartments enclosed by host-derived membranes. Further analysis of this stable relationship should provide novel insights into the complex interactions of intracellular multiple-partner associations.",

        "abstract": "Chlamydiae are a unique group of obligate intracellular bacteria comprising important pathogens of vertebrates as well as symbionts of free-living amoebae. Although there is ample molecular evidence for a huge diversity and wide distribution of chlamydiae in nature, environmental chlamydiae are currently represented by only few isolates. This paper reports the recovery of a novel environmental chlamydia strain from activated sludge by co-cultivation with Acanthamoeba sp. The recovered environmental chlamydia strain UV-7 showed the characteristic morphology of chlamydial developmental stages as revealed by electron microscopy and was identified as a new member of the family Parachlamydiaceae (98.7 % 16S rRNA sequence similarity to Parachlamydia acanthamoebae). Infection studies suggested that Parachlamydia sp. UV-7 is not confined to amoeba hosts but is also able to invade mammalian cells. These findings outline a new straightforward approach to retrieving environmental chlamydiae from nature without prior, tedious isolation and cultivation of their natural host cells, and lend further support to suggested implications of environmental chlamydiae for public health.",

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes is widely used for the investigation of uncultured bacteria in complex microbial communities and has recently also been shown to be a valuable tool for the rapid detection of various bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens. Here we report on the development and evaluation of a hierarchic probe set for the specific detection and differentiation of chlamydiae, particularly C. pneumoniae, C. trachomatis, C. psittaci, and the recently described chlamydia-like bacteria comprising the novel genera Neochlamydia and PARACHLAMYDIA: The specificity of the nine newly developed probes was successfully demonstrated by in situ hybridization of experimentally infected amoebae and HeLa 229 cells, including HeLa 229 cells coinfected with C. pneumoniae and C. trachomatis. FISH reliably stained chlamydial inclusions as early as 12 h postinfection. The sensitivity of FISH was further confirmed by combination with direct fluorescence antibody staining. In contrast to previously established detection methods for chlamydiae, FISH was not susceptible to false-positive results and allows the detection of all recognized chlamydiae in one single step.",

        "abstract": "Ammonia-oxidizing archaea of the phylum Thaumarchaeota are among the most abundant marine microorganisms. These organisms thrive in the oceans despite ammonium being present at low nanomolar concentrations. Some Thaumarchaeota isolates have been shown to utilize urea and cyanate as energy and N sources through intracellular conversion to ammonium. Yet, it is unclear whether patterns observed in culture extend to marine Thaumarchaeota, and whether Thaumarchaeota in the ocean directly utilize urea and cyanate or rely on co-occurring microorganisms to break these substrates down to ammonium. Urea utilization has been reported for marine ammonia-oxidizing communities, but no evidence of cyanate utilization exists for marine ammonia oxidizers. Here, we demonstrate that in the Gulf of Mexico, Thaumarchaeota use urea and cyanate both directly and indirectly as energy and N sources. We observed substantial and linear rates of nitrite production from urea and cyanate additions, which often persisted even when ammonium was added to micromolar concentrations. Furthermore, single-cell analysis revealed that the Thaumarchaeota incorporated ammonium-, urea- and cyanate-derived N at significantly higher rates than most other microorganisms. Yet, no cyanases were detected in thaumarchaeal genomic data from the Gulf of Mexico. Therefore, we tested cyanate utilization in Nitrosopumilus maritimus, which also lacks a canonical cyanase, and showed that cyanate was oxidized to nitrite. Our findings demonstrate that marine Thaumarchaeota can use urea and cyanate as both an energy and N source. On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that urea and cyanate are substrates for ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota throughout the ocean.",

An emerging technique to analyse microbes at single-cell resolution is surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (surface-enhanced Raman scattering: SERS). Optimised SERS procedures enable fast analytical read-outs with specific molecular information, providing insight into the chemical composition of microbiological samples. Knowledge about the origin of microbial SERS signals and parameter(s) affecting their occurrence, intensity and/or reproducibility is crucial for reliable SERS-based analyses. In this work, we explore the feasibility and limitations of the SERS approach for characterizing microbial cells and investigate the applicability of SERS for single-cell sorting as well as for three-dimensional visualization of microbial communities. Analyses of six different microbial species (an archaeon, two Gram-positive bacteria, three Gram-negative bacteria) showed that for several of these organisms distinct features in their SERS spectra were lacking. As additional confounding factor, the physiological conditions of the cells (as influenced by e.g., storage conditions or deuterium-labelling) were systematically addressed, for which we conclude that the respective SERS signal at the single-cell level is strongly influenced by the metabolic activity of the analysed cells. While this finding complicates the interpretation of SERS data, it may on the other hand enable probing of the metabolic state of individual cells within microbial populations of interest.",

Candidatus Accumulibacter conform to the classical physiology model for polyphosphate accumulating organisms and are widely believed to be the most important player for the process in full-scale EBPR systems. However, it was impossible till now to quantify the contribution of specific microbial clades to EBPR. In this study, we have developed a new tool to directly link the identity of microbial cells to the absolute quantification of intracellular poly-P and other polymers under in situ conditions, and applied it to eight full-scale EBPR plants. Besides Ca. Accumulibacter, members of the genus Tetrasphaera were found to be important microbes for P accumulation, and in six plants they were the most important. As these Tetrasphaera cells did not exhibit the classical phenotype of poly-P accumulating microbes, our entire understanding of the microbiology of the EBPR process has to be revised. Furthermore, our new single-cell approach can now also be applied to quantify storage polymer dynamics in individual populations in situ in other ecosystems and might become a valuable tool for many environmental microbiologists.",

However, the diversity of microorganisms and the factors that control it are poorly understood. Using a systematic global-sampling effort, we analysed the 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences from ~1,200 activated sludge samples taken from 269 WWTPs in 23 countries on 6 continents. Our analyses revealed that the global activated sludge bacterial communities contain ~1 billion bacterial phylotypes with a Poisson lognormal diversity distribution. Despite this high diversity, activated sludge has a small, global core bacterial community (n\u2009=\u200928 operational taxonomic units) that is strongly linked to activated sludge performance. Meta-analyses with global datasets associate the activated sludge microbiomes most closely to freshwater populations. In contrast to macroorganism diversity, activated sludge bacterial communities show no latitudinal gradient. Furthermore, their spatial turnover is scale-dependent and appears to be largely driven by stochastic processes (dispersal and drift), although deterministic factors (temperature and organic input) are also important. Our findings enhance our mechanistic understanding of the global diversity and biogeography of activated sludge bacterial communities within a theoretical ecology framework and have important implications for microbial ecology and wastewater treatment processes.",

        "abstract": "Marine sponges represent one of the few eukaryotic groups that frequently harbor symbiotic members of the Thaumarchaeota, which are important chemoautotrophic ammonia-oxidizers in many environments. However, in most studies, direct demonstration of ammonia-oxidation by these archaea within sponges is lacking, and little is known about sponge-specific adaptations of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA). Here, we characterized the thaumarchaeal symbiont of the marine sponge Ianthella basta using metaproteogenomics, fluorescence in situ hybridization, qPCR and isotope-based functional assays. \"Candidatus Nitrosospongia ianthellae\" is only distantly related to cultured AOA. It is an abundant symbiont that is solely responsible for nitrite formation from ammonia in I. basta that surprisingly does not harbor nitrite-oxidizing microbes. Furthermore, this AOA is equipped with an expanded set of extracellular subtilisin-like proteases, a metalloprotease unique among archaea, as well as a putative branched-chain amino acid ABC transporter. This repertoire is strongly indicative of a mixotrophic lifestyle and is (with slight variations) also found in other sponge-associated, but not in free-living AOA. We predict that this feature as well as an expanded and unique set of secreted serpins (protease inhibitors), a unique array of eukaryotic-like proteins, and a DNA-phosporothioation system, represent important adaptations of AOA to life within these ancient filter-feeding animals.

In particular, metagenomic analysis of nucleic acids provides direct access to the genomes of the \u201cuncultivated majority.\u201d Accelerated by advances in sequencing technology, microbiologists have discovered more novel phyla, classes, genera, and genes from microorganisms in the first decade and a half of the twenty-first century than since these \u201cmany very little living animalcules\u201d were first discovered by van Leeuwenhoek (Table 1). The unsurpassed diversity of soils promises continued exploration of a range of industrial, agricultural, and environmental functions. The ability to explore soil microbial communities with increasing capacity offers the highest promise for answering many outstanding who, what, where, when, why, and with whom questions such as: Which microorganisms are linked to which soil habitats? How do microbial abundances change with changing edaphic conditions? How do microbial assemblages interact and influence one another synergistically or antagonistically? What is the full extent of soil microbial diversity, both functionally and phylogenetically? What are the dynamics of microbial communities in space and time? How sensitive are microbial communities to a changing climate? What is the role of horizontal gene transfer in the stability of microbial communities? Do highly diverse microbial communities confer resistance and resilience in soils?",

Here we show that in two stratified freshwater lakes a substantial part of upward-diffusing methane was oxidized by filamentous gamma-proteobacteria related to Crenothrix polyspora. These filamentous bacteria have been known as contaminants of drinking water supplies since 1870, but their role in the environmental methane removal has remained unclear. While oxidizing methane, these organisms were assigned an 'unusual' methane monooxygenase (MMO), which was only distantly related to 'classical' MMO of gamma-proteobacterial methanotrophs. We now correct this assignment and show that Crenothrix encode a typical gamma-proteobacterial PmoA. Stable isotope labeling in combination swith single-cell imaging mass spectrometry revealed methane-dependent growth of the lacustrine Crenothrix with oxygen as well as under oxygen-deficient conditions. Crenothrix genomes encoded pathways for the respiration of oxygen as well as for the reduction of nitrate to NO. The observed abundance and planktonic growth of Crenothrix suggest that these methanotrophs can act as a relevant biological sink for methane in stratified lakes and should be considered in the context of environmental removal of methane.",

Nitrospira plays pivotal roles in nitrification as an aerobic chemolithoautotrophic nitrite-oxidizing bacterium. These bacteria often occur in close association with ammonia-oxidizing bacteria or archaea that convert ammonia to nitrite, which is further oxidized to nitrate by Nitrospira. However, in 'reciprocal feeding' interactions, Nitrospira can also provide ammonia oxidizers with ammonia released from urea or cyanate, which is further nitrified as described above. Recently discovered Nitrospira members even catalyze both nitrification steps alone and are therefore called complete ammonia oxidizers or 'comammox' organisms. Some strains of Nitrospira utilize alternative substrates, such as H and formate, using oxygen or nitrate as terminal electron acceptor, and can exploit these energy sources concurrently with aerobic nitrite oxidation. This metabolic versatility enables Nitrospira to colonize a broad range of habitats and to sustain shifts in environmental conditions such as changing oxygen concentrations.",

        "abstract": "Nitrification is a key process of the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle and of biological wastewater treatment. The second step, nitrite oxidation to nitrate, is catalyzed by phylogenetically diverse, chemolithoautotrophic nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). Uncultured NOB from the genus \" Nitrotoga\" are widespread in natural and engineered ecosystems. Knowledge about their biology is sparse, because no genomic information and no pure \" Nitrotoga\" culture was available. Here we obtained the first \" Nitrotoga\" isolate from activated sludge. This organism, \" Nitrotoga fabula,\" prefers higher temperatures (>20\u00b0C; optimum, 24 to 28\u00b0C) than previous \" Nitrotoga\" enrichments, which were described as cold-adapted NOB. \" Nitrotoga fabula\" also showed an unusually high tolerance to nitrite (activity at 30\u00a0mM NO) and nitrate (up to 25\u00a0mM NO). Nitrite oxidation followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with an apparent  () of ~89 \u00b5M nitrite and a  of ~28 \u00b5mol of nitrite per mg of protein per h. Key metabolic pathways of \" Nitrotoga fabula\" were reconstructed from the closed genome. \" Nitrotoga fabula\" possesses a new type of periplasmic nitrite oxidoreductase belonging to a lineage of mostly uncharacterized proteins. This novel enzyme indicates (i) separate evolution of nitrite oxidation in \" Nitrotoga\" and other NOB, (ii) the possible existence of phylogenetically diverse, unrecognized NOB, and (iii) together with new metagenomic data, the potential existence of nitrite-oxidizing archaea. For carbon fixation, \" Nitrotoga fabula\" uses the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. It also carries genes encoding complete pathways for hydrogen and sulfite oxidation, suggesting that alternative energy metabolisms enable \" Nitrotoga fabula\" to survive nitrite depletion and colonize new niches. Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) are major players in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle and critical for wastewater treatment. However, most NOB remain uncultured, and their biology is poorly understood. Here, we obtained the first isolate from the environmentally widespread NOB genus \" Nitrotoga\" and performed a detailed physiological and genomic characterization of this organism (\" Nitrotoga fabula\"). Differences between key phenotypic properties of \" Nitrotoga fabula\" and those of previously enriched \" Nitrotoga\" members reveal an unexpectedly broad range of physiological adaptations in this genus. Moreover, genes encoding components of energy metabolisms outside nitrification suggest that \" Nitrotoga\" are ecologically more flexible than previously anticipated. The identification of a novel nitrite-oxidizing enzyme in \" Nitrotoga fabula\" expands our picture of the evolutionary history of nitrification and might lead to discoveries of novel nitrite oxidizers. Altogether, this study provides urgently needed insights into the biology of understudied but environmentally and biotechnologically important microorganisms.",

NOB were traditionally perceived as physiologically restricted organisms and were less intensively studied than other nitrogen-cycling microorganisms. This picture is in contrast to new discoveries of an unexpected high diversity of mostly uncultured NOB and a great physiological versatility, which includes complex microbe\u2013microbe interactions and lifestyles outside the nitrogen cycle. Most surprisingly, close relatives to NOB perform complete nitrification (ammonia oxidation to nitrate) and this finding will have far-reaching implications for nitrification research.

        "title": "Characterization of the First \"Candidatus Nitrotoga\" Isolate Reveals Metabolic Versatility and Separate Evolution of Widespread Nitrite-Oxidizing Bacteria",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT  Nitrification is a key process of the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle and of biological wastewater treatment. The second step, nitrite oxidation to nitrate, is catalyzed by phylogenetically diverse, chemolithoautotrophic nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). Uncultured NOB from the genus \u201c Candidatus  Nitrotoga\u201d are widespread in natural and engineered ecosystems. Knowledge about their biology is sparse, because no genomic information and no pure \u201c Ca . Nitrotoga\u201d culture was available. Here we obtained the first \u201c Ca . Nitrotoga\u201d isolate from activated sludge. This organism, \u201c Candidatus  Nitrotoga fabula,\u201d prefers higher temperatures (u003e20\u00b0C; optimum, 24 to 28\u00b0C) than previous \u201c Ca . Nitrotoga\u201d enrichments, which were described as cold-adapted NOB. \u201c Ca . Nitrotoga fabula\u201d also showed an unusually high tolerance to nitrite (activity at 30\u00a0mM NO 2  \u2212 ) and nitrate (up to 25\u00a0mM NO 3  \u2212 ). Nitrite oxidation followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with an apparent  K   m   ( K   m (app) ) of ~89 \u00b5M nitrite and a  V  max  of ~28 \u00b5mol of nitrite per mg of protein per h. Key metabolic pathways of \u201c Ca . Nitrotoga fabula\u201d were reconstructed from the closed genome. \u201c Ca . Nitrotoga fabula\u201d possesses a new type of periplasmic nitrite oxidoreductase belonging to a lineage of mostly uncharacterized proteins. This novel enzyme indicates (i) separate evolution of nitrite oxidation in \u201c Ca . Nitrotoga\u201d and other NOB, (ii) the possible existence of phylogenetically diverse, unrecognized NOB, and (iii) together with new metagenomic data, the potential existence of nitrite-oxidizing archaea. For carbon fixation, \u201c Ca . Nitrotoga fabula\u201d uses the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. It also carries genes encoding complete pathways for hydrogen and sulfite oxidation, suggesting that alternative energy metabolisms enable \u201c Ca . Nitrotoga fabula\u201d to survive nitrite depletion and colonize new niches.   IMPORTANCE  Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) are major players in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle and critical for wastewater treatment. However, most NOB remain uncultured, and their biology is poorly understood. Here, we obtained the first isolate from the environmentally widespread NOB genus \u201c Candidatus  Nitrotoga\u201d and performed a detailed physiological and genomic characterization of this organism (\u201c Candidatus  Nitrotoga fabula\u201d). Differences between key phenotypic properties of \u201c Ca . Nitrotoga fabula\u201d and those of previously enriched \u201c Ca . Nitrotoga\u201d members reveal an unexpectedly broad range of physiological adaptations in this genus. Moreover, genes encoding components of energy metabolisms outside nitrification suggest that \u201c Ca . Nitrotoga\u201d are ecologically more flexible than previously anticipated. The identification of a novel nitrite-oxidizing enzyme in \u201c Ca . Nitrotoga fabula\u201d expands our picture of the evolutionary history of nitrification and might lead to discoveries of novel nitrite oxidizers. Altogether, this study provides urgently needed insights into the biology of understudied but environmentally and biotechnologically important microorganisms.",

Cultivation experiments revealed maximal growth and survival under steady flow of high oxygen and low sulfide concentrations. We aimed at directly demonstrating the sulfur-oxidizing, chemoautotrophic nature of the symbionts and at investigating putative carbon transfer from the symbiont to the ciliate host. We performed pulse-chase incubations with C- and C-labeled bicarbonate under varying environmental conditions. A combination of tissue autoradiography and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry coupled with transmission electron microscopy was used to follow the fate of the radioactive and stable isotopes of carbon, respectively. We show that symbiont cells fix substantial amounts of inorganic carbon in the presence of sulfide, but also (to a lesser degree) in the absence of sulfide by utilizing internally stored sulfur. Isotope labeling patterns point to translocation of organic carbon to the host through both release of these compounds and digestion of symbiont cells. The latter mechanism is also supported by ultracytochemical detection of acid phosphatase in lysosomes and in food vacuoles of ciliate cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization of freshly collected ciliates revealed that the vast majority of ingested microbial cells were ectosymbionts.",

The use of biodegradable instead of nonbiodegradable polymers in single-use agricultural applications, including plastic mulching, promises to reduce plastic accumulation in the environment. We present a novel approach that allows tracking of carbon from biodegradable polymers into CO and microbial biomass. The approach is based on C-labeled polymers and on isotope-specific analytical methods, including nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS). Our results unequivocally demonstrate the biodegradability of poly(butylene adipate--terephthalate) (PBAT), an important polyester used in agriculture, in soil. Carbon from each monomer unit of PBAT was used by soil microorganisms, including filamentous fungi, to gain energy and to form biomass. This work advances both our conceptual understanding of polymer biodegradation and the methodological capabilities to assess this process in natural and engineered environments.",

        "abstract": "Resource limitation is a fundamental factor governing the composition and function of ecological communities. However, the role of resource supply in structuring the intestinal microbiome has not been established and represents a challenge for mammals that rely on microbial symbionts for digestion: too little supply might starve the microbiome while too much might starve the host. We present evidence that microbiota occupy a habitat that is limited in total nitrogen supply within the large intestines of 30 mammal species. Lowering dietary protein levels in mice reduced their faecal concentrations of bacteria. A gradient of stoichiometry along the length of the gut was consistent with the hypothesis that intestinal nitrogen limitation results from host absorption of dietary nutrients. Nitrogen availability is also likely to be shaped by host-microbe interactions: levels of host-secreted nitrogen were altered in germ-free mice and when bacterial loads were reduced via experimental antibiotic treatment. Single-cell spectrometry revealed that members of the phylum Bacteroidetes consumed nitrogen in the large intestine more readily than other commensal taxa did. Our findings support a model where nitrogen limitation arises from preferential host use of dietary nutrients. We speculate that this resource limitation could enable hosts to regulate microbial communities in the large intestine. Commensal microbiota may have adapted to nitrogen-limited settings, suggesting one reason why excess dietary protein has been associated with degraded gut-microbial ecosystems.",

        "abstract": "Legume-rhizobia symbioses play a major role in food production for an ever growing human population. In this symbiosis, dinitrogen is reduced ('fixed') to ammonia by the rhizobial nitrogenase enzyme complex and is secreted to the plant host cells, while dicarboxylic acids derived from photosynthetically-produced sucrose are transported into the symbiosomes and serve as respiratory substrates for the bacteroids. The symbiosome membrane contains high levels of SST1 protein, a sulfate transporter. Sulfate is an essential nutrient for all living organisms, but its importance for symbiotic nitrogen fixation and nodule metabolism has long been underestimated. Using chemical imaging, we demonstrate that the bacteroids take up 20-fold more sulfate than the nodule host cells. Furthermore, we show that nitrogenase biosynthesis relies on high levels of imported sulfate, making sulfur as essential as carbon for the regulation and functioning of symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Our findings thus establish the importance of sulfate and its active transport for the plant-microbe interaction that is most relevant for agriculture and soil fertility. This article provides a comprehensive explanation for the importance of the nodule specific sulfate transporter (SST1) and the role of sulfate by dissecting the sulfur distribution across the nodule tissue and directly linking sulfate incorporation to nitrogenase biosynthesis.",

        "abstract": "(1) The Life in the Atacama project investigated the regional distribution of life and habitats in the Atacama Desert of Chile. We sought to create biogeologic maps through survey traverses across the desert using a rover carrying biologic and geologic instruments. Elements of our science approach were to: Perform ecological transects from the relatively wet coastal range to the arid core of the desert; use converging evidence from science instruments to reach conclusions about microbial abundance; and develop and test exploration strategies adapted to the search of scattered surface and shallow subsurface microbial oases. Understanding the ability of science teams to detect and characterize microbial life signatures remotely using a rover became central to the project. Traverses were accomplished using an autonomous rover in a method that is technologically relevant to Mars exploration. We present an overview of the results of the 2003, 2004, and 2005 field investigations. They include: The confirmed identification of microbial habitats in daylight by detecting fluorescence signals from chlorophyll and dye probes; the characterization of geology by imaging and spectral measurement; the mapping of life along transects; the characterization of environmental conditions; the development of mapping techniques including homogeneous biological scoring and predictive models of habitat location; the development of exploration strategies adapted to the search for life with an autonomous rover capable of up to 10 km of daily traverse; and the autonomous detection of life by the rover as it interprets observations on-the-fly and decides which targets to pursue with further analysis.",

        "abstract": "The science goals of the Life in the Atacama (LITA) robotic field experiment are to understand habitat and seek out life in the Atacama Desert, Chile, as an analog to future missions to Mars. To those ends, we present a new data analysis tool, the LITA Data Scoring System (DSS), which (1) integrates rover and orbital data relevant to environmental habitability and life detection, and (2) provides a standard metric, or \u201cscore\u201d to evaluate (a) the potential habitability, and (b) the strength of evidence for life at all locales along the rover's traverse. Designed and tested during the 2005 field campaign, first results from the DSS indicate that the three selected sites in the Atacama Desert are generally inhospitable. The strength of evidence for life is positively correlated with potential habitability at two of the three sites. Using factor analysis, we find three factors explain 79.9% of the variance in biological observations and five factors explain 96.2% of the variance in potential habitability across all sites. These factors are used to focus a discussion of scoring variable definitions for future robotic missions in the Atacama and of instrument selection and strategy development for future robotic missions on Earth and Mars.",

We are developing the Zo\u00eb chassis as an alternative to the traditional six-wheeled, rocker-bogie system used by Mars rovers flown in the past ten years. Zo\u00eb travels over rough terrain using only four independent drive motors. Steering is accomplished by differentially driving pairs of these motors to passively articulate front and rear steering axles. In this paper we present a detailed mechanical design of the chassis, a description of Zo\u00eb's steering controller and results of steering controller tests that validate this design. We also include lessons learned after field experiments in the Atacama Desert of Chile.",

        "abstract": "As part of the three-year \u2018Life in the Atacama\u2019 (LITA) project, plant and microbial abundance were mapped within three sites in the Atacama Desert, Chile, using an automated robotic rover. On-board fluorescence imaging of six biological signatures (e.g., chlorophyll, DNA, proteins) was used to assess abundance, based on a percent positive sample rating system and standardized robotic ecological transects. The percent positive rating system scored each sample based on the measured signal strength (0 for no signal to 2 for strong signal) for each biological signature relative to the total rating possible. The 2005 field experiment results show that percent positive ratings varied significantly across Site D (coastal site with fog), with patchy zones of high abundance correlated with orbital and microscale habitat types (heaved surface crust and gravel bars); alluvial fan habitats generally had lower abundance. Non-random multi-scale biological patchiness also characterized interior desert Sites E and F, with relatively high abundance associated with (paleo)aqueous habitats such as playas. Localized variables, including topography, played an important, albeit complex, role in microbial spatial distribution. Site D biosignature trends correlated with culturable soil bacteria, with MPN ranging from 10-1000 CFU/g-soil, and chlorophyll ratings accurately mapped lichen/moss abundance (Site D) and higher plant (Site F) distributions. Climate also affected biological patchiness, with significant correlation shown between abundance and (rover) air relative humidity, while lichen patterns were linked to the presence of fog. Rover biological mapping results across sites parallel longitudinal W-E wet/dry/wet Atacama climate trends. Overall, the study highlights the success of targeting of aqueous-associated habitats identifiable from orbital geology and mineralogy. The LITA experience also suggests the terrestrial study of life and its distribution, particularly the fields of landscape ecology and ecohydrology, hold critical lessons for the search for life on other planets. Their applications to robotic sampling strategies on Mars should be further exploited.",

Its average distance per autonomous traverse is 672 m with 75 traverses over one kilometer in a single command cycle. Zo\u00eb's payload includes instruments to rapidly measure biologic and geologic properties of the environment.

        "abstract": "(1) The Life in the Atacama project examined six different sites in the Atacama Desert (Chile) over 3 years in an attempt to remotely detect the presence of life with a rover. The remote science team, using only orbital and rover data sets, identified areas with a high potential for life as targets for further inspection by the rover. Orbital data in the visible/near infrared (VNIR) and in the thermal infrared (TIR) were used to examine the mineralogy, geomorphology, and chlorophyll potential of the field sites. Field instruments included two spectrometers (VNIR reflectance and TIR emission) and a neutron detector: this project represents the first time a neutron detector has been used as part of a ''science-blind'' rover field test. Rover-based spectroscopy was used to identify the composition of small scale features not visible in the orbital images and to improve interpretations of those data sets. The orbital and ground-based data sets produced consistent results, suggesting that much of the field sites consist of altered volcanic terrains with later deposits of sulfates, quartz, and iron oxides. At one location (Site A), the ground-based spectral data revealed considerably greater compositional diversity than was seen from the orbital view. One neutron detector transect provided insight into subsurface hydrogen concentrations, which correlated with life and surface features. The results presented here have implications for targeting strategies, especially for future Mars rover missions looking for potential habitats/paleohabitats.",

The distribution and diversity of life in the Atacama remains unexplored and is the focus of the Life in the Atacama project. To conduct this investigation, survey traverses across the desert with biologic and geologic instruments will allow us to create biogeographic maps. We accomplish these surveys with an autonomous astrobiology rover. In this paper we motivate the Life in the Atacama project and report on the second of three field seasons of scientific investigation and technical experiments in Chile. We describe the rover, instruments, algorithms and assess intermediate results. These results provide insight into the design of an effective robotic astrobiologist for future planetary investigations and into the best methods to conduct astrobiologic surveys.",

The method is based on multiple total internal reflections (TIR) of an incident laser beam within a glass slide, such that individual samples on top of the glass slide are illuminated simultaneously by an evanescent electromagnetic field. Enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) anchored to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane is optically excited and transfers its excitation energy via the peptide linker Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVD) to an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein. Upon apoptosis, DEVD is cleaved, and energy transfer is disrupted, as proven by an increase of fluorescence intensity as well as of fluorescence lifetime of the donor ECFP. Due to selective excitation of membrane-associated fluorophores, intracellular fluorescence and background luminescence from the surrounding medium are eliminated. Therefore, this test system appears to be a sensitive device for the detection of apoptosis and more generally for drug screening or in vitro diagnosis on a nanometer scale.",

The generalized polarization (GP, characterizing a spectral shift which depends on the phase of membrane lipids) as well as the effective fluorescence lifetime (tau(eff)) of the membrane marker laurdan were revealed to be appropriate parameters for membrane stiffness and fluidity. GP decreased with temperature, but increased during cell growth and was always higher for the plasma membrane than for intracellular membranes. Microdomains of different fluorescence lifetimes tau(eff) were observed at temperatures above 30 degree C and disappeared during cell aging. Non-radiative energy transfer was used to detect laurdan selectively in close proximity to a molecular acceptor (DiI) and may present a possibility for measuring membrane dynamics in specific microenvironments.",

        "abstract": "Pharmaceutical agents or drugs often have a pronounced impact on protein-protein interactions in cells, and in particular, cell membranes. Changes of molecular conformations as well as of intermolecular interactions may affect dipole-dipole interaction between chromophoric groups, which can be proven by measuring the F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). If these chromophores are located within or in close proximity to the plasma membrane, they are excited preferentially by an evanescent electromagnetic wave upon total internal reflection (TIR) of an incident laser beam. For the TIR-FRET screening of larger cell collectives, we performed three separate steps: (1) setting up of a membrane associated test system for probing the interaction between the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2; (2) use of the Epac-SH188 sensor for quantitative evaluation under the microscope; and (3) application of a TIR fluorescence reader to probe the interaction of GFP with Nile Red. In the first two steps, we measured FRET from cyan (CFP) to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) by spectral analysis and fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) upon illumination of whole cells (epi-illumination) as well as selective illumination of their plasma membranes by TIR. In particular, TIR excitation permitted FRET measurements with high sensitivity and low background. The Epac sensor showed a more rapid response to pharmaceutical agents, e.g., Forskolin or the A2B adenosine receptor agonist NECA, in close proximity to the plasma membrane compared to the cytosol. Finally, FRET from a membrane associated GFP to Nile Red was used to test a multi-well TIR fluorescence reader with simultaneous detection of a larger number of samples.",

These light doses were in the range of a few J/cm(2) up to about 200 J/cm(2) depending on the wavelength of illumination as well as on the presence or absence of a fluorescent dye (e.g., the membrane marker laurdan).

The method is based on splitting of a laser beam and multiple total internal reflections (TIR) within the bottom of a microtiter plate (cell substrate), such that up to 96 individual samples are illuminated simultaneously by an evanescent electromagnetic field. Main prerequisites are an appropriate thickness and a high transmission of the glass bottom, which is attached to the 96-well cell culture plate by a noncytotoxic adhesive. Glass rods of rectangular cross sections are optically coupled to this bottom for TIR illumination. Fluorescence arising from the plasma membrane of living cells is detected simultaneously from all samples using an integrating charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. The TIR fluorescence reader is validated using cultivated cells incubated with different fluorescent markers, as well as stably transfected cells expressing a fluorescent membrane-associating protein. In addition, particularly with regard to potential pharmaceutical applications, the kinetics of the intracellular translocation of a fluorescent protein kinase c fusion protein upon stimulation of the cells is determined.",

        "abstract": "A promising clinical application of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-induced protoporphyrin IX (PP IX) is fluorescence detection and photodynamic treatment of residual tumour tissue during surgical resection of high grade malignant glioma. U373 MG human glioblastoma cells were used as a model system to study the relation between intracellular location and photodynamic efficacy of 5-ALA-induced PP IX in more detail. Therefore, ultra-sensitive fluorescence microscopy, using either optical excitation of whole cells or selective excitation of the plasma membrane by an evanescent electromagnetic field, was combined with quantitative measurements of intracellular porphyrin amount and phototoxicity. Glioblastoma cells accumulated PP IX to a moderate extent as compared to T47D breast cancer cells (high accumulation) or OV2774 ovarian cancer cells (low accumulation). Although photodynamic inactivation of the different cell lines (decreasing in the order T47D > U373 MG > OV2774) seemed to be directly related to PP IX accumulation, examination of the data in more detail revealed that photodynamic efficacy per photosensitizer molecule (PE) was about two times higher in glioblastoma and ovarian cancer cells as compared to breast cancer cells. The different photodynamic efficacy of PP IX was related to the different intracellular location. In contrast to breast cancer cells where PP IX fluorescence was localized in small granules, PP IX fluorescence in glioblastoma cells and ovarian cancer cells originated mainly from cellular membranes. Thus, the intracellular location of PP IX in a predominantly lipophilic environment, characterized by a comparably high photostability (probed by photobleaching and photoproduct formation) and a lower degree of porphyrin aggregation (probed previously by fluorescence decay kinetics), seems to be the key factor for high photodynamic efficacy of 5-ALA-induced PP IX. In the case of OV2774 ovarian cancer cells, however, a low PP IX accumulation limited cell inactivation upon irradiation, whereas the results obtained for glioblastoma cells are encouraging to develop PDT to an additional therapeutic option for the treatment of tumour margins in patients who underwent fluorescence-guided resection of high grade malignant glioma after 5-ALA administration.",

Enhanced cyan fluorescent protein anchored to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of living cells is optically excited by an evanescent electromagnetic field and transfers its excitation energy via a spacer (DEVD) to an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein. Upon apoptosis, DEVD is cleaved and energy transfer is disrupted, as proven by pronounced changes in fluorescence spectra and decay times. Fluorescence spectroscopy and lifetime imaging (FLIM) is combined with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) for selective detection of this membrane-bound caspase sensor. Fluorophores of the cytoplasm are thus excluded, and the signal-to-background ratio is increased considerably. In comparison with conventional or laser scanning microscopy, this permits long-term observation of apoptosis in live cell cultures using very low absorption and avoiding light-induced damages of the samples.",

        "abstract": "Lifetime images of autofluorescence of cultivated endothelial cells were recorded using a novel picosecond laser diode in the near ultraviolet range (375 nm). In contrast to existing picosecond light sources this wavelength permits efficient excitation of the free and protein bound coenzyme NADH with fluorescence lifetimes of 0.4-0.5 ns and 2.0-2.5 ns, respectively. The effective fluorescence lifetime tau(eff) (depending on both lifetimes) was homogenously distributed over the cells with some shortening in the perinuclear region, possibly close to mitochondria. A slight decrease of tau(eff) was observed after inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, whereas a slight increase was observed after inhibition of the glycolytic pathway, thus indicating variations of the ratio of free and protein bound NADH. Although present applications are still limited by their low pulse energy (< or = 5 pJ), uv picosecond laser diodes have a large potential in high resolution fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence lifetime endoscopy.",

        "abstract": "Single cell microscopy in a three-dimensional (3-D) environment is reported. Cells are grown in an agarose culture gel, located within microcapillaries and observed from different sides after adaptation of an innovative device for sample rotation. Thus, z -stacks can be recorded by confocal microscopy in different directions and used for illustration in 3-D. This gives additional information, since cells or organelles that appear superimposed in one direction, may be well resolved in another one. The method is tested and validated with single cells expressing a membrane or a mitochondrially associated green fluorescent protein, or cells accumulating fluorescent quantum dots. In addition, axial tomography supports measurements of cellular uptake and distribution of the anticancer drug doxorubicin in the nucleus (2 to 6 h after incubation) or the cytoplasm (24 h). This paper discusses that upon cell rotation an enhanced optical resolution in lateral direction compared to axial direction can be utilized to obtain an improved effective 3-D resolution, which represents an important step toward super-resolution microscopy of living cells.",

Now improved experimental techniques \u2013 including axial tomography and Light Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM) \u2013 permit observation of single cells from any side as well as detection of individual layers in multi-cellular spheroids. Therefore, uptake of doxorubicin in the cell nucleus as well re-localization in the cytoplasm at longer incubation times is well documented. Based on a calcein-AM test, we could prove high cytotoxicity in 3D cell cultures at 48-96h after incubation. Simultaneously, disintegration of cell spheroids and formation of a degradation product became obvious. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is presently used to distinguish the fluorescence of doxorubicin and its degradation product, and Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) is suggested to improve resolution down to about 100\u00a0nm.",

        "abstract": "It has been recently shown that Catechol O-methyltransfer- ase (COMT) Val158Met polymorphism strongly influences prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response (ASR) in healthy human volunteers. Given that schizophre- nia patients exhibit impairment in PPI and that COMT is a putative susceptibility gene for schizophrenia, we investi- gated the impact of the COMT Val158Met polymorphisms on PPI in schizophrenic inpatients. We analyzed COMT Val158Met polymorphisms and assessed startle reactivity, habituation, and PPI of ASR in 68 Caucasian schizophre- nia inpatients. Clinical symptoms were measured with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Patients carrying the Val158Met Met/Met allele showed elevated PPI levels whereas startle reactivity and habituation did not differ from the other two genotypes. These preliminary results imply that PPI is influenced by COMT Val158Met genotype in schizophrenia as well. In concert with other findings, our data suggest that PPI is a polygenic trait.",

        "abstract": "Several polymorphisms of the transcription factor 4 (TCF4) have been shown to increase the risk for schizophrenia, particularly TCF4 rs9960767. This polymorphism is associated with impaired sensorimotor gating measured by prepulse inhibition--an established endophenotype of schizophrenia. We therefore investigated whether TCF4 polymorphisms also affect another proposed endophenotype of schizophrenia, namely sensory gating assessed by P50 suppression of the auditory evoked potential. Although sensorimotor gating and sensory gating are not identical, recent data suggest that they share genetic fundamentals. In a multicenter study at six academic institutions throughout Germany, we applied an auditory P50 suppression paradigm to 1,821 subjects (1,023 never-smokers, 798 smokers) randomly selected from the general population. Samples were genotyped for 21 TCF4 polymorphisms. Given that smoking is highly prevalent in schizophrenia and affects sensory gating, we also assessed smoking behavior, cotinine plasma concentrations, exhaled carbon monoxide, and the Fagerstr\u00f6m Test (FTND). P50 suppression was significantly decreased in carriers of schizophrenia risk alleles of the TCF4 polymorphisms rs9960767, rs10401120rs, rs17597926, and 17512836 (P < 0.0002-0.00005). These gene effects were modulated by smoking behavior as indicated by significant interactions of TCF4 genotype and smoking status; heavy smokers (FTND score \u2265 4) showed stronger gene effects on P50 suppression than light smokers and never-smokers. Our finding suggests that sensory gating is modulated by an interaction of TCF4 genotype with smoking, and both factors may play a role in early information processing deficits also in schizophrenia. Consequently, considering smoking behavior may facilitate the search for genetic risk factors for schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "Gray matter reduction and ventricular enlargement belong to the best replicated findings in schizophrenia. Brain morphologic changes were also found in non-schizophrenic family members (FM). The intention of this study was to examine whether non-psychotic first-degree relatives reveal similar morphologic changes as schizophrenic patients and how state of genetic loading contribute to these abnormalities.Forty-nine schizophrenic patients, 71 non-schizophrenic FM and 48 control subjects took part in this volumetric MRI study. All subjects were between 18 and 59 years old. Dependent variables were gray matter, white matter and total cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume, determined by SPM99 segmentation algorithm. As an important part of CSF lateral ventricle volume was determined manually by removing surrounding CSF areas.In schizophrenic patients compared to controls and non-schizophrenic FM total CSF volumes and lateral ventricles were increased. Gray and, to a lesser degree, white matter volumes were decreased as well. For CSF, gray and white matter there was no significant difference between uni- and multiple affected families. CSF correlated significantly negative with gray matter (r=-0.78) and, less intensive, with white matter (r=-0.40). There were negative correlations between gray and white matter volume as well (r=-0.26). These correlations were not significantly different between the diagnostic groups.CSF enlargement and gray matter reductions in schizophrenic patients compared to controls and non-affected FM seem to be interdependent findings. However, this correlation is independent of the factor diagnosis and is therefore not specific for schizophrenia.",

Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 5-HT2AR-encoding gene (HTR2A; 13q14-21) were genotyped to control for a potential bias in BP1\u2032 due to between-group differences in genotype distributions.\n \n \n \n Results\u00a0\u00a0Group comparisons of partial-volume corrected PET data by statistical parametric mapping and confirmatory volume of interest\n analysis yielded a dissemination of BP1\u2032 decreases consistent with increasing levels of risk.

        "abstract": "Previous research demonstrated that depression is associated with hyperactivity of the hypothalamus\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenocortical (HPA) system after stimulation. There is also strong evidence that the modulation of corticosteroids in the brain induces memory dysfunction which represents core features of depression. Antidepressant treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) alleviates both dysfunctions. Thus, these previous observations propose a correlation between treatment induced changes of the endocrinological response of the HPA system to challenge with dexamethasone and CRH and changes of memory functions during antidepressant treatment. This study explores the relationship between depression, memory functions and the responsiveness of the HPA system as assessed by the combined DEX/CRH test during antidepressant treatment in n =64 patients with major depression during a four weeks treatment with citalopram. We found that treatment induced changes of the cortisol response pattern in the DEX/CRH test were correlated with improvement of working memory but not so with episodic memory, sustained attention or global severity of depression. We suggest that improvement of working memory is more sensitive to the changes of hormones of the HPA system (e.g. cortisol) than other cognitive functions and the global severity of depression.",

The high frequency of obsessive-compulsive symptoms reported in subjects with the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome) or Prader-Willi syndrome (15q11-13 deletion of the paternally derived chromosome), suggests that gene dosage effects in these chromosomal regions could increase risk for OCD. Therefore, the aim of this study was to search for microrearrangements in these two regions in OCD patients.We screened the 15q11-13 and 22q11.2 chromosomal regions for genomic imbalances in 236 patients with OCD using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA).No deletions or duplications involving 15q11-13 or 22q11.2 were identified in our patients.Our results suggest that deletions/duplications of chromosomes 15q11-13 and 22q11.2 are rare in OCD. Despite the negative findings in these two regions, the search for copy number variants in OCD using genome-wide array-based methods is a highly promising approach to identify genes of etiologic importance in the development of OCD.",

        "abstract": "Working memory dysfunction is a prominent impairment in patients with schizophrenia. Our aim was to determine cerebral dysfunctions by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a large sample of first-episode schizophrenia patients during a working memory task. 75 first-episode schizophrenia patients and 81 control subjects, recruited within a multi-center study, performed 2- and 0-back tasks while brain activation was measured with fMRI. In order to guarantee comparability between data quality from different scanners, we developed and adopted a standardized, fully automated quality assurance of scanner hard- and software as well as a measure for in vivo data quality. After these quality-control measures had been implemented, 48 patients and 57 controls were included in the final analysis. During attention-related processes, even when the performance between patients and controls was comparable, there was a recognizable emergence of cerebral dysfunctions with hypoactivations in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), in the superior temporal cortex and in the thalamus. During working memory performance, parietal hypoactivations, especially in the precuneus, were prominent and were accompanied by poorer performance in patients. A hyperfrontality emerged in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Hence, results point to a dysfunctional ventrolateral prefrontal-parietal network during working memory in patients, suggesting impairments in basic functions such as retrieval, storage and maintenance. The brain activation pattern of this large and significant sample of first-episode schizophrenia patients indicates an imbalanced system failing to adjust the amount of brain activity required in the cerebral network involved in attention and working memory.",

        "abstract": "Schizophrenia patients exhibit impairment in prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response (ASR), suggesting a sensorimotor gating deficit. The serotonin-2A receptor (5-HT(2A)R) has been implicated in both the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and the PPI deficits of schizophrenia patients. Moreover, both schizophrenia and PPI are thought to be inheritable. We investigated the impact of three 5-HT(2A)R polymorphisms (A-1438G, T102C, H452Y) on PPI in schizophrenia patients.We analyzed the 5-HT(2A)R A-1438G, T102C, and H452Y polymorphisms and assessed startle reactivity, habituation, and PPI of ASR in 68 Caucasian schizophrenia inpatients. Patients were also examined with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.The 5-HT(2A)R A-1438G and T102C polymorphisms were in complete linkage disequilibrium. Patients carrying the T102C TT and the A-1438G AA allele show significantly higher PPI levels and a faster early habituation compared with all other variants. 5-HT(2A)R A-1438G and T102C genotype explained approximately 11% of the PPI and early habituation variance. In contrast, the 5-HT(2A)R H452Y polymorphism did not affect startle parameters.Our findings suggest that PPI and habituation are modulated by 5-HT(2A)R A-1438G and T102C genotype in schizophrenia. Consequently, alterations within brain 5-HT(2A)Rs may contribute to the PPI deficits in schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, evidence has been accumulating indicating a major role of glutamate in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Of particular importance in this regard are the metabotropic glutamate receptors (GRM). Thus, a recently published trial of the amino acid analogue LY2140023, which exerts its effects through the activation of the glutamate receptors GRM3/GRM2, showed an improvement of positive and negative symptoms comparable to treatment with olanzapine. A functional variant of GRM3 has been described which modulates synaptic glutamate levels. We assessed whether this functional variant rs6465084 is related to schizophrenia in a large sample of patients and controls. We found an increased frequency of the A allele (p=0.027) and the AA genotype (p=0.024) in schizophrenia patients. Moreover, in an assessment of schizophrenia endophenotypes, patients of the AA genotype performed poorly in the digit symbol test, a measure of attention (p=0.008). Our results provide further evidence for the potential importance of the glutamate receptor GRM3 in schizophrenia, and indicate that the novel antipsychotic LY2140023 may actually be targeting a pathogenic pathway of schizophrenia.",

Our aim was to assess differential brain activation between patients carrying an at-risk allele on the Neuregulin 1 gene and patients without this genetic risk. Neural signal changes between 14 first episode schizophrenia patients with the at risk allele (SNP8NRG221533) from the Icelandic core haplotype and 14 without were measured with fMRI during a working memory task. Patients without the at risk allele showed greater activations (P < 0.05; corrected) in the left hippocampus, precuneus and cerebellum, as well as the right anterior cingulate. Brain regions previously associated with the pathology of Schizophrenia are differentially affected in those with a genetic at risk status in the NRG1 gene. Heterogeneity of structural and functional measures within patients characterized by clinical phenotypes may be in part due to this genetic variation.",

        "abstract": "The genetic factors determining the progression of prodromal syndromes to first episode schizophrenia have remained enigmatic to date. In a unique prospective multicentre trial, we assessed whether variants at the D-amino acid oxidase activator (DAOA)/G72 locus influence progression to psychosis. Young subjects with a prodromal syndrome were observed prospectively for up to 2 years to assess the incidence of progression to schizophrenia or first episode psychosis. Of the 82 probands with a prodromal syndrome, 21 probands experienced progression to psychosis within the observation period. Assessment of nine common variants in the DAOA/G72 locus yielded two variants with the predictive value for symptom progression: all four probands with the rs1341402 CC genotype developed psychosis compared with 17 out of 78 probands with the TT or CT genotypes (chi(2) = 12.348; df = 2; p = 0.002). The relative risk for progression to psychosis was significantly increased in the CC genotype: RR = 4.588 (95% CI = 2.175-4.588). Similarly, for rs778294, 50% of probands with the AA genotype, but only 22% of probands with a GG or GA genotype progressed to psychosis (chi(2) = 7.027; df = 2; p = 0.030). Moreover, haplotype analysis revealed a susceptibility haplotype for progression to psychosis. This is one of the first studies to identify a specific genetic factor for the progression of prodromal syndromes to schizophrenia, and further underscores the importance of the DAOA/G72 gene for schizophrenia.",

Increased error rates in the antisaccade task and prolonged antisaccade latencies have been found in patients with schizophrenia and their first degree relatives. We investigated oculomotor performance in 41 parents of schizophrenia patients and 22 controls with a prosaccade task and an antisaccade task. Parents were grouped into parents with a positive family history for schizophrenia (N=9) and parents with a negative family history for schizophrenia (N=32). An overlap-paradigm was applied; eye movements were recorded using infrared oculography. The combined group of parents made more antisaccade direction errors than controls (p=0.005) and there was a linear increase in direction errors from controls via negative family history parents to positive family history parents (p=0.008). Antisaccade latencies were prolonged in the combined parent group (p=0.057) compared to controls and there was a linear increase in latency with genetic loading (p=0.018). No group differences were found for prosaccade parameters. These results support the hypothesis that antisaccade impairment is associated with genetic loading for schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "Until now, there is a lack of useful biological markers to predict suicidal behavior in depressive patients. However, it is consistently found that suicidality is associated with a central serotonin deficit. Animal data suggest that prepulse inhibition (PPI) as well as habituation of the acoustic startle response (ASR), which are established as operational measures for sensorimotor gating, decreases after serotonin depletion. Thus, we investigated PPI and habituation of ASR in suicidal patients with depressive disorders as potential biological markers for suicidal behavior.PPI and habituation of ASR was measured in 20 depressive patients who had at least one suicide attempt within the last three month. Eighteen healthy matched controls were examined likewise.Suicidal depressive patients did not differ from healthy controls in PPI, startle reactivity and habituation of ASR. Subgroup analyses showed that factors such as severity of depression, impulsiveness, gender, smoking, lethality of the last suicide attempt, number of suicide attempts, and medication had no influence on the results.These results suggest that neither PPI nor habituation of ASR could serve as useful markers for suicidality.",

Evidence indicates a contribution of genetic and environmental factors, especially the influence of obstetric complications to this volume reduction. The aim of this study was to compare hippocampal volume of schizophrenic patients as well as and their relatives with control subjects and to quantify the additional contribution of obstetric complications.T1 weighted MRI brain scans of 50 schizophrenic patients, 88 first-degree relatives and 53 healthy control subjects were used to perform volumetric measurements on the left and right hippocampus. A set of clinical measures including obstetric complications were recorded for all family members.Numerically our measurements revealed a hippocampal volume reduction in schizophrenic patients (left: -14%, right: -15%) and, although less pronounced, in their unaffected relatives (left: -6%, right: -10%). Noted differences in hippocampal volume between schizophrenic patients and controls were only significant for the left side. Hippocampal volumes of patients and their relatives with obstetric complications were reduced bilaterally.Hippocampal volume reduction is present in schizophrenic patients and their first-degree relatives, suggesting an influence of genetic factors. In addition, however, obstetric complications have also been shown to play a major role.",

Recent evidence suggests that CHRFAM7A is a locus with a possible role in schizophrenia and cognitive functioning. We studied an antisaccade task as a fronto-parietal measure of executive function that reflects risk for schizophrenia. Association of CHRFAM7A genotype with antisaccade performance was assessed in 103 healthy Caucasian individuals. No significant associations of 2-bp deletion or CHRFAM7A copy number with antisaccade performance parameters were observed. The failure to observe an association between antisaccade performance and polymorphisms in CHRFAM7A gene is consistent with specificity of the gene effects on hippocampal and memory functions as previously demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "Harm avoidance is a personality trait characterized by excessive worrying and fear of uncertainty, which has repeatedly been related to anxiety disorders. Converging lines of research in rodents and humans point towards an involvement of the nicotinic cholinergic system in the modulation of anxiety. Most notably, the rs1044396 polymorphism in the CHRNA4 gene, which codes for the \u03b14 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, has been linked to negative emotionality traits including harm avoidance in a recent study. Against this background, we investigated the association between harm avoidance and the rs1044396 polymorphism using data from N=1673 healthy subjects, which were collected in the context of the German multi-centre study \u05f3Genetics of Nicotine Dependence and Neurobiological Phenotypes\u05f3. Homozygous carriers of the C-allele showed significantly higher levels of harm avoidance than homozygous T-allele carriers, with heterozygous subjects exhibiting intermediate scores. The effect was neither modulated by age or gender nor by smoking status. By replicating previous findings in a large population-based sample for the first time, the present study adds to the growing evidence suggesting an involvement of nicotinic cholinergic mechanism in anxiety and negative emotionality, which may pose an effective target for medical treatment.",

Recently pharmacological studies suggested a role of the serotonin (5-HT) 3 receptor in schizophrenia. The 5-HT3 receptors are the only ligand-gated ion channels within the 5-HT receptor family. Applying an endophenotype approach, we investigated a potential impact of the genes of the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits as well as the novel 5-HT3C, 5-HT3D, and 5-HT3E subunits on CPT performance in subjects with schizophrenia. The study included 196 patients with schizophrenia, 113 of their parents, and 205 healthy controls recruited from community registers. Sustained attention was assessed with the Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs (CPT-IP). Assessing functional and coding variants of the 5-HT3 receptor subunit genes, we found the GG genotype of the 5-HT3E subunit gene (rs7627615; Thr86Ala) to be associated with better attentional capacities in subjects with schizophrenia and healthy controls. This study provides additional evidence for a role of the serotonergic system and the 5-HT3 receptor in schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "Alterations of the auditory evoked P300 potential are among the most reliable biological markers of schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to assess the amplitude, latency, and topography of the P300 in individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis.P300 event-related potentials were acquired with an auditory oddball paradigm from 100 patients putatively in an early initial prodromal state (EIPS) for psychosis or in a late initial prodromal state (LIPS), according to the criteria of the German Research Network on Schizophrenia, and from 40 healthy controls comparable with respect to age, gender, and estimated verbal IQ.In the LIPS group, P300 amplitude was significantly smaller at midline and left hemispheric electrodes in comparison with controls. In the EIPS group, P300 amplitude was significantly reduced at a left temporoparietal site (TP7). A family history of schizophrenia was associated with smaller posterior P300 amplitudes in high-risk individuals. Midline P300 amplitudes were smaller in LIPS who had experienced already brief limited intermittent psychotic symptoms.Smaller P300 amplitudes are present prior to a putative onset of psychosis in high-risk individuals. Selective left temporoparietal amplitude deficits may indicate a trait-like abnormality whereas deficits at sagittal midline electrodes may be partly determined by the changes that underlie the appearance of psychotic symptoms. P300 amplitude may be associated with left superior temporal lobe maturation abnormalities followed by further functional impairments later in life. Our follow-up study will reveal whether P300 amplitude alterations predict psychosis and help to targeting early intervention.",

The present study explores the effect of specific cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) as compared with supportive counselling (SC) on social adjustment in people in a potential early initial prodromal state of psychosis (EIPS) primarily defined by self-experienced cognitive thought and perception deficits (basic symptoms).A total of 128 help-seeking outpatients in the EIPS were randomized to receive either specific CBT or SC for 12 months. Social adjustment was assessed with the Social Adjustment Scale II (SAS II) at baseline, time of transition or post treatmentFrom 113 patients, who completed the SAS II at intake, 67 (59.3%) completed the SAS assessments at time of transition or post treatment. Both specific CBT and SC resulted in improvements in scales of SAS II, with no significant between-group differences post treatment.\u2002 Although treatment in specially designed early detection and intervention centres improves functioning of people in the EIPS, specific CBT was not superior to SC. One could hypothesize that additional vocational rehabilitation, case management and involvement of multidisciplinary teams are needed to further improve short-term outcome of specific interventions on this dimension.",

We used [18F] altanserin and positron emission tomography (PET) in a pilot study of 6 individuals suspected to be at elevated risk for\n schizophrenia and seven age-matched controls to test the hypothesis that regional 5-HT2AR binding is altered in the prodromal stages of schizophrenia.

        "abstract": "The recently proposed latent variable \u03b4 is a new tool for dementia case finding. It is built in a structural equation modeling framework of cognitive and functional data and constitutes a novel endophenotype for Alzheimer's disease (AD) research and clinical trials.To investigate the association of \u03b4 with AD biomarkers and to compare the prediction of \u03b4 with established scales for conversion to dementia in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).Using data from a multicenter memory clinic study, we examined the external associations of the latent variable \u03b4 and compared \u03b4 with well-established cognitive and functional scales and cognitive-functional composite scores. For that purpose, logistic regressions with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and conversion to dementia as dependent variables were performed with the investigated scores. The models were tested for significant differences.In patients with MCI, \u03b4 based on a broad range of cognitive scales (including the ADAS-cog, the MMSE, and the CERAD neuropsychological battery) predicted an abnormal CSF A\u03b2 42/tau ratio indicative of AD (n\u200a=\u200a340, AUC\u200a=\u200a0.78, p\u200a< \u200a0.001), and predicted incident dementia within 1-3 years of follow-up (n\u200a=\u200a525, AUC\u200a=\u200a0.84, p\u200a< \u200a0.001). These associations were generally stronger than for any other scale or cognitive-functional composite examined. Homologs of \u03b4 based on reduced test batteries yielded somewhat lower effects.These findings support the interpretation of \u03b4 as a construct capturing the disease-related \"essence\" of cognitive and functional impairments in patients with MCI and dementia, and suggest that \u03b4 might become an analytical tool for dementia research.",

        "abstract": "Neuropsychological deficits are candidate endophenotypes of schizophrenia which can assist to explain the neurocognitive impact of genetic risk variants. The identification of endophenotypes is often based on the familiality of these phenotypes. Several studies demonstrate neuropsychological deficits in unaffected biological relatives of schizophrenia patients without differentiating between genetic and non-genetic factors underlying these deficits. We assessed N=129 unaffected biological parents of schizophrenia patients, N=28 schizophrenia patients (paranoid subtype), and N=143 controls without a family history of schizophrenia with an extensive neuropsychological test battery. Direct comparison of N=22 parents with an ancestral history of schizophrenia (more likely carriers, MLC) and N=17 of their spouses without such a history (less likely carriers, LLC) allowed the separation of genetic and non-genetic aspects in cognition. Overall, parents showed significant deficits in neuropsychological tasks from all cognitive domains with medium effect sizes. Direct comparisons of MLC- and LLC-parents showed that attentional and executive tasks were most strongly affected by genetic loading. To conclude, unaffected parents of schizophrenia patients showed modest yet significant impairments in attention, memory, and executive functioning. In particular, attentional and executive impairments varied most strongly with genetic loading for schizophrenia, prioritising these dysfunctions for genotype-endophenotype analyses.",

        "abstract": "Most neuropsychological studies on schizophrenia suffer from sample selection bias, with male and chronic patients being overrepresented. This probably leads to an overestimation of cognitive impairments. The present study aimed to provide a less biased estimate of cognitive functions in schizophrenia using a population-representative catchment area sample. Schizophrenia patients (N\u00a0=\u00a089) from the prospective Mannheim ABC cohort were assessed 14\u00a0years after disease onset and first diagnosis, using a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. A healthy control group (N\u00a0=\u00a090) was carefully matched according to age, gender, and geographic region (city, rural surrounds). The present sample was representative for the initial ABC cohort. In the comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, the schizophrenia patients were only moderately impaired as compared to the healthy control group (d\u00a0=\u00a00.56 for a general cognitive index, d\u00a0=\u00a00.42 for verbal memory, d\u00a0=\u00a00.61 for executive functions, d\u00a0=\u00a00.69 for attention). Only 33\u00a0% of the schizophrenia patients scored one standard deviation unit below the healthy control group\u00a0in the general cognitive index. Neuropsychological performance did not correlate with measures of the clinical course including age at onset, number of hospital admissions, and time in paid work. Thus, in this population-representative sample of schizophrenia patients, neuropsychological deficits were less pronounced than expected from meta-analyses. In agreement with other epidemiological studies, this suggests a less devastating picture of cognition in schizophrenia. ",

Primary outcome was progression to psychosis at 12- and 24-month follow-up.A total of 128 help-seeking out-patients in an EIPS were randomised. Integrated psychological intervention was superior to supportive counselling in preventing progression to psychosis at 12-month follow-up (3.2% v. 16.9%; P = 0.008) and at 24-month follow-up (6.3% v. 20.0%; P = 0.019).Integrated psychological intervention appears effective in delaying the onset of psychosis over a 24-month time period in people in an EIPS.",

No relapse according to predefined criteria occurred within the first year, but a total of 29 patients fulfilled post-hoc criteria of \"clinical deterioration\". Impairments in cognitive functioning assessed by the Trail-Making Test B at the onset of long-term treatment differentiated between patients with vs. without later clinical deterioration and proved to be a significant predictor of the clinical course in a regression analysis outperforming initial clinical status as predictor. However, low sensitivity (72%) and specificity (51%) limit possibilities of a transfer to individual predictions. As a linear combination of neuropsychological and psychopathological variables obtained highest predictive validity, such a combination may improve the prediction of the course of schizophrenic disorders and may ultimately lead to a more efficient and comprehensive treatment planning.",

HA was assessed with Cloninger's Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ).Subjects with OCD had higher scores of HA than controls (p<or=0.001). First degree relatives of OCD cases also showed higher HA than relatives of control subjects (p=0.001).These results remained stable when comparing only OCD subjects versus controls (p<or=0.001) and relatives of OCD cases versus relatives of controls (p=0.005) without current comorbid disorders.The investigation of HA alone does not allow to disentangle the transmission of biological versus psychological factors related to an elevated level of anxiety in families of OCD cases.This is the first study to extent previous findings of elevated HA in OCD cases to their first degree relatives. Thus, HA may partially mediate the familial risk for OCD.",

        "abstract": "Variant rs2522833 of the Piccolo-encoding gene PCLO has recently been found to be associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). PCLO encodes a presynaptic cytomatrix protein which influences monoamine neurotransmitter release. Piccolo could therefore play an important role in treatment response to antidepressant therapy and the improvement of alterations in HPA system reactivity. We investigated the influence of the coding variant rs2522833 in the PCLO gene on treatment response in 205 in-patients with unipolar depression. Treatment response was measured (1) at the level of psychopathology using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and (2) with the combined dexamethasone/corticotropin-releasing hormone (Dex/CRH) test, which is a refined tool for showing dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system, a neurobiological finding in depression. While we did not find an association between variation in PCLO and HAMD scores, HPA dysregulation was less pronounced in carriers of the AA genotype than in carriers of one or two C alleles. HPA activity of individuals with the AA genotype only marginally changed during 4-wk antidepressant treatment, whereas C allele carriers showed a higher hormonal secretion at admission than carriers of the AA genotype but lower responsivity to the Dex/CRH challenge after 4 wk. Our results point to a moderating role of PCLO SNP rs2522833 on HPA regulation during antidepressant treatment, which may represent a neurobiological feature of stability of clinical response.",

        "abstract": "Among serotonin (5-HT) receptors, the 5-HT3 receptor is the only ligand-gated ion channel. 5-HT3 antagonists such as ondansetron and tropisetron may improve auditory gating and neurocognitive deficits in schizophrenic patients. Moreover, many antipsychotic drugs are antagonists at 5-HT3 receptors. However, the role of 5-HT3 receptor variants on response to antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenic patients is still unclear.In a prospective, randomized, double-blind study, we have assessed six functional and coding variants of the subunit genes HTR3A, HTR3B as well as the novel HTR3C, HTR3D, and HTR3E subunits in the response to haloperidol or risperidone. Seventy patients were treated for 4 weeks and positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology were measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).HTR3E had an effect on the speed of response to antipsychotics. GG-allele carriers responded more quickly to treatment on the PANSS negative symptom subscale (P = 0.03) and on the total PANSS score (P = 0.04) irrespective of medication. In a second independent study of 144 schizophrenia patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, this effect could not be confirmed.Our findings argue against a major effect of HTR3 variants in response to antipsychotics. Solely, the HTR3E and also the HTR3A variant could exert a weak effect on the speed of response to antipsychotics.",

        "abstract": "Theoretical models postulate an important role of attributional style (AS) in the formation and maintenance of persecutory delusions and other positive symptoms of schizophrenia. However, current research has gathered conflicting findings. In a cross-sectional design, patients with persistent positive symptoms of schizophrenia (n = 258) and healthy controls (n = 51) completed a revised version of the Internal, Personal and Situational Attributions Questionnaire (IPSAQ-R) and assessments of psychopathology. In comparison to controls, neither patients with schizophrenia in general nor patients with persecutory delusions (n = 142) in particular presented an externalizing and personalizing AS. Rather, both groups showed a \"self-blaming\" AS and attributed negative events more toward themselves. Persecutory delusions were independently predicted by a personalizing bias for negative events (beta = 0.197, P = .001) and by depression (beta = 0.152, P = .013), but only 5% of the variance in persecutory delusions could be explained. Cluster analysis of IPSAQ-R scores identified a \"personalizing\" (n = 70) and a \"self-blaming\" subgroup (n = 188), with the former showing slightly more pronounced persecutory delusions (P = .021). Results indicate that patients with schizophrenia and patients with persecutory delusions both mostly blamed themselves for negative events. Nevertheless, still a subgroup of patients could be identified who presented a more pronounced personalizing bias and more severe persecutory delusions. Thus, AS in patients with schizophrenia might be less stable but more determined by individual and situational characteristics that need further elucidation.",

This issue is discussed with a focus on prepulse inhibition (PPI) as a neurobiological phenotype and the 5HT2a-receptor as a candidate gene. A series of recent studies illuminates that PPI and 5HT2a-receptors present as vulnerability markers for schizophrenia; a functional sequence variant in the 5HT2a-gene is contributing to this relationship and might consequently contribute to the genetic predisposition to schizophrenia with a very small risk increase.",

        "abstract": "Recently, in a post-mortem and a subsequent structural MR study, a significantly increased gyrification index (GI) was demonstrated in the frontal lobe in individuals with schizophrenia. To examine whether frontal lobe hypergyria is region-specific and whether this might be a suitable endophenotype in the search for the genetic basis of schizophrenia, the frontal as well as parieto-occipital GI were determined in MRI scans of families affected with schizophrenia.In the MRI scans of 48 subjects suffering from schizophrenia, in 82 of their first-degree relatives and in 41 control subjects, the GI was determined in three sections anterior to the genu of the corpus callosum and three sections posterior to the splenium, thus allowing for a selective determination of this measure in the frontal as well as the parietal lobe. Outer and inner contours constituting the GI was determined in each section by manual tracing. Statistical analysis was performed using MANOVA with factors diagnostic group and intervening factors from preliminary analyses.The frontal, but not parieto-occipital GI was significantly higher in schizophrenic patients as well as unaffected relatives compared with control subjects (right: 7%, F=13.24, df=3, 155, p<0.0005, left: 6%, F=8.92, df=3, 155, p<0.0005). There was no overall difference between affected and unaffected family members. On the left side however, there was a significant interaction between diagnostic group and genetic loading (F=4.68, df=2, 101, p=0.01): significantly higher GI was found in affected compared with unaffected family members only in uniaffected and not multiaffected families.These results support our primary finding of hypergyria in the frontal lobe in schizophrenic patients. Compared to the parietal lobe, hypergyria seems to affect the frontal lobe selectively and serves as a suitable neurodevelopmental, possibly even an endophenotypic marker.",

        "abstract": "It has been demonstrated that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has a moderate effect on symptom reduction and on general well being of patients suffering from psychosis. However, questions regarding the specific efficacy of CBT, the treatment safety, the cost-effectiveness, and the moderators and mediators of treatment effects are still a major issue. The major objective of this trial is to investigate whether CBT is specifically efficacious in reducing positive symptoms when compared with non-specific supportive therapy (ST) which does not implement CBT-techniques but provides comparable therapeutic attention.The POSITIVE study is a multicenter, prospective, single-blind, parallel group, randomised clinical trial, comparing CBT and ST with respect to the efficacy in reducing positive symptoms in psychotic disorders. CBT as well as ST consist of 20 sessions altogether, 165 participants receiving CBT and 165 participants receiving ST. Major methodological aspects of the study are systematic recruitment, explicit inclusion criteria, reliability checks of assessments with control for rater shift, analysis by intention to treat, data management using remote data entry, measures of quality assurance (e.g. on-site monitoring with source data verification, regular query process), advanced statistical analysis, manualized treatment, checks of adherence and competence of therapists. Research relating the psychotherapy process with outcome, neurobiological research addressing basic questions of delusion formation using fMRI and neuropsychological assessment and treatment research investigating adaptations of CBT for adolescents is combined in this network. Problems of transfer into routine clinical care will be identified and addressed by a project focusing on cost efficiency.This clinical trial is part of efforts to intensify psychotherapy research in the field of psychosis in Germany, to contribute to the international discussion on psychotherapy in psychotic disorders, and to help implement psychotherapy in routine care. Furthermore, the study will allow drawing conclusions about the mediators of treatment effects of CBT of psychotic disorders.",

        "abstract": "Suicidal ideation has been related to cognitive rigidity whereas suicidal behaviour itself was associated with specific executive deficits. Yet it remains unclear if a distinct cognitive suicidal phenotype does exist. The aim of the present study was to further investigate the role of suicidal thinking for the neuropsychological performance in depressive suicide attempters.Depressive inpatients after a recent suicide attempt, who either had present suicidal ideation (n=14) or not (n=15) and healthy controls (n=29) were recruited. The groups were assessed by means of executive tasks designed to capture impulsive decision-making, and with verbal memory and attention tests. Self-rating measures of impulsivity and aggression were further applied.Only patients with current suicidal ideation showed executive dysfunctions with impaired decision-making being the most salient. Verbal memory and attention were reasonably intact in all patients. All patients reported increased aggression.Suicidal ideation is clearly associated with impaired cognitive performance. Our results suggest that executive deficits seen in depressive suicide attempters have a state-dependent component.",

        "abstract": "Attentional gating deficits, commonly measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response (ASR), have been established as an endophenotype of schizophrenia. Prepulse inhibition is heritable and has been associated with polymorphisms in serotonin and dopamine system genes. Prepulse inhibition can be enhanced by nicotine, and therefore it has been proposed that schizophrenia patients smoke to ameliorate their early attentional deficits. The PPI-enhancing effects of nicotine in rodents are strain dependent, suggesting a genetic contribution to PPI within the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) system. Recent human genetic studies also imply that tobacco dependence is affected by polymorphisms in the alpha3/alpha5 subunits of the nAChR (CHRNA3/CHRNA5) gene cluster. We, therefore, investigated the impact of two common CHRNA3 polymorphisms (rs1051730/rs1317286) on PPI, startle reactivity, and habituation of the ASR in two independent samples of 107 healthy British volunteers and 73 schizophrenia patients hailing from Germany. In both samples, PPI was influenced by both CHRNA3 polymorphisms (combined p-value=0.0027), which were strongly linked. Moreover, CHRNA3 genotype was associated with chronicity, treatment, and negative symptoms in the schizophrenia sample. These results suggest that sensorimotor gating is influenced by variations of the CHRNA3 gene, which might also have an impact on the course and severity of schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "Chronic administration of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is associated with long-term depletion of serotonin (5-HT) and loss of 5-HT axons in the brains of rodents and nonhuman primates. Despite the broad database concerning the selective serotonergic neurotoxicity of recreational MDMA consumption by humans, controversy still exists with respect to the question of whether the well-known functional consequences of these neurotoxic effects, such as memory impairment, were caused by chronic 5-HT deficiency. Habituation and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response (ASR) can be used as a marker of central serotonergic functioning in rodents and humans. Thus, we investigated the functional status of the central serotonergic system in chronic but abstinent MDMA users by measuring PPI and habituation of ASR. PPI and habituation of ASR were measured in three groups. The first group (MDMA group) included 20 male drug-free chronic users of MDMA; the second group (cannabis group) consisted of 20 male drug-free chronic users of cannabis; and the third group (healthy controls) comprised 20 male participants with no history of illicit drug use. Analysis revealed significantly increased PPI of MDMA users compared to those of cannabis users and healthy controls. Cannabis users and healthy controls showed comparable patterns of PPI. There were no differences in habituation among the three groups. These results suggest that the functional consequences of chronic MDMA use may be explained by 5-HT receptor changes rather than by a chronic 5-HT deficiency condition. Use of cannabis does not lead to alterations of amplitude, habituation, or PPI of ASR.",

        "abstract": "Preclinical and clinical data suggest modulating effects of appetite-regulating hormones and stress perception on food intake. Nicotine intake also interferes with regulation of body weight. Especially following smoking cessation gaining weight is a common but only partially understood consequence. The aim of this study was to examine the interaction between smoking habits, the appetite regulating hormone leptin, negative affectivity, and stress vulnerability on eating behavior in a clinical case-control study under standardized conditions. In a large population-based study sample, we compared leptin and cortisol plasma concentrations (radioimmunoassay) between current tobacco smokers with high cognitive restraint and disinhibition in eating behavior and smokers scoring low in both categories as assessed with the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ; Stunkard & Messick, 1985). As a measure for smoking effects on the stress axis, the saliva cortisol concentrations were compared before and after nicotine smoking. Additionally, stress perception was assessed with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), symptoms of depression and anxiety with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). In smokers showing high cognitive restraint and disinhibition we found significantly higher leptin concentrations than in the group of smokers scoring low in both categories. Furthermore there was a significant group difference in saliva cortisol concentrations after nicotine intake. Smokers showing high cognitive restraint and disinhibition were also characterized by significantly higher scores in the STAI, the PSS and the BDI. Our results suggest that smokers with a pathological eating behavior show an impaired neuroendocrine regulation of appetite and are prone to experience higher levels of stress and negative affectivity. This interaction of behavioral and neuroendocrinological factors may constitute a high risk condition for gaining weight following smoking cessation.",

However, there is only preliminary evidence about impaired PPI in OCD so far.Acoustic PPI was measured in 30 OCD patients and 30 matched healthy controls with a paradigm using different prepulse intensities. Psychopathology assessment included ratings for obsessions, compulsions, and depression.PPI was reduced in OCD patients, and this deficit was most pronounced for most intense (16 dB(A)) prepulses, where mean PPI was 39.6% in unmedicated patients (n = 4), 45.8% in medicated patients, and 58.9% in controls. No group differences were observed with regard to the habituation of acoustic startle magnitude. Startle measures were generally not associated with clinical measures, although such associations may have been obscured by medication effects.The present study confirms deficient central inhibitory functioning in patients with OCD and supports the model of deficient frontostriatal circuits in OCD. The relationship of PPI deficits to pharmacological and behavioral treatment and to possible subtypes of OCD merits further study.",

The SGA amisulpride, however, only binds to D2/D3 receptors, which makes it an interesting tool to test this assumption. In a randomized controlled trial, 52 schizophrenic patients were allocated to treatment with either olanzapine (10-20 mg/day) or amisulpride (400-800 mg/day). A comprehensive neuropsychological test battery and clinical ratings were used to assess participants at inclusion and after 4 and 8 weeks. Cognitive improvements of moderate size were observed, with effect sizes similar to those obtained in previous studies on the cognitive effects of SGAs. Importantly, amisulpride was not inferior to olanzapine for any cognitive domain. Combined 5-HT(2A)/D2 receptor blockade is probably not necessary for cognitive improvement by SGAs.",

        "abstract": "Only few studies have investigated executive impairment in the euthymic phase of unipolar affective disorders, yielding diverging results. The role of impulsivity/orbitofrontal associated executive functioning in remitted depression has not yet been examined.Partly remitted male out-patients (n = 15) with non-psychotic major depression (MDD) were compared with healthy males (n = 15) on several neuropsychological tests. Executive tasks focussed on orbitofrontal function (Go/No-Go, Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), delayed alternation task). Furthermore, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) was administered to all subjects.Executive skills of the patients were largely unimpaired. Patients exhibited significant deficits on measures of verbal memory only. Residual depressive symptoms in patients were correlated with diminished response inhibition. BIS-11 scores were not elevated in the patients.Both executive impairment related to orbitofrontal function and self-reported impulsive behaviour in major depression seem to be state-dependent. In accordance with other studies, patients with remitted unipolar depression showed a persistent verbal memory loss.",

        "abstract": "To develop risk-adapted prevention of psychosis, an accurate estimation of the individual risk of psychosis at a given time is needed. Inclusion of biological parameters into multilevel prediction models is thought to improve predictive accuracy of models on the basis of clinical variables. To this aim, mismatch negativity (MMN) was investigated in a sample clinically at high risk, comparing individuals with and without subsequent conversion to psychosis.At baseline, an auditory oddball paradigm was used in 62 subjects meeting criteria of a late risk at-state who remained antipsychotic-naive throughout the study. Median follow-up period was 32 months (minimum of 24 months in nonconverters, n = 37). Repeated-measures analysis of covariance was employed to analyze the MMN recorded at frontocentral electrodes; additional comparisons with healthy controls (HC, n = 67) and first-episode schizophrenia patients (FES, n = 33) were performed. Predictive value was evaluated by a Cox regression model.Compared with nonconverters, duration MMN in converters (n = 25) showed significantly reduced amplitudes across the six frontocentral electrodes; the same applied in comparison with HC, but not FES, whereas the duration MMN in in nonconverters was comparable to HC and larger than in FES. A prognostic score was calculated based on a Cox regression model and stratified into two risk classes, which showed significantly different survival curves.Our findings demonstrate the duration MMN is significantly reduced in at-risk subjects converting to first-episode psychosis compared with nonconverters and may contribute not only to the prediction of conversion but also to a more individualized risk estimation and thus risk-adapted prevention.",

Therefore, research aims at diagnosing MCI at an early stage with short, simple and easily administrable screening tests. Due to the fact that the Clock Drawing Test (CDT) is widely used to screen for dementia, it is questionable whether it is suited to screen for MCI.3,198 primary care patients aged 75+ were divided into two groups according to their cognitive status, assessed by comprehensive neuropsychological testing: individuals without MCI and individuals with MCI. The CDT scores, evaluated by the scoring system of Sunderland et al. [J Am Geriatr Soc 1989;37:725-729], of both groups were compared. Multivariate analyses were calculated and the sensitivity and specificity of the CDT to screen for MCI were reported.Significant differences were found for CDT results: MCI patients obtained worse results than cognitively unimpaired subjects. CDT has a significant impact on the diagnosis of MCI. However, sensitivity and specificity as well as receiver operating characteristic analyses are not adequate, meaning that the CDT could not be named as an exact screening tool.Applying different CDT versions of administration and scoring could yield different results.CDT does not achieve the quality to screen individuals for MCI.",

Previous studies in humans suggested that PPI is a stable and reliable measure between test sessions, but that PPI decreases within sessions. The purpose of this study was to explore the short- and long-term decrease in PPI as a potential confound in the measurement and interpretation of PPI. We investigated the progression of PPI and habituation of ASR in three test sessions spaced 4 weeks apart in a group of 20 healthy participants. Analysis revealed a significant decrease in the percent PPI within and between the test sessions. Nevertheless, PPI was reliable across three test sessions, indicating that the significant attenuation of PPI over time was a consistent phenomenon. These results suggest that PPI exhibits short- and long-term attenuation.",

        "abstract": "Saccadic eye movements are well-described markers of cerebral function and have been widely studied in schizophrenia spectrum populations. However, less is known about saccades in individuals clinically at risk for schizophrenia. Therefore, we studied individuals in an at-risk mental state (ARMS) (N\u2009=\u2009160), patients in their first episode of schizophrenia (N\u2009=\u200932) and healthy controls (N\u2009=\u200975). N\u2009=\u200988 ARMS participants showed an early at-risk mental state (E-ARMS), defined by cognitive-perceptive basic symptoms (COPER) or a combination of risk and loss of function, whereas N\u2009=\u200972 were in a late at-risk mental state (L-ARMS), defined by attenuated psychotic symptoms or brief limited intermittent psychotic symptoms. We examined prosaccades, reflecting overt attentional shifts, and antisaccades, measuring inhibitory control, as well as their relationship as an indicator of the interplay of bottom-up and top-down influences. L-ARMS but not E-ARMS participants had increased antisaccade latencies compared to controls. First-episode patients had higher antisaccade error rates compared to E-ARMS participants and controls, and increased latencies compared to all other groups. Prosaccade latencies did not differ between groups. We observed the expected negative correlation between prosaccade latency and antisaccade error rate, indicating that individuals with shorter prosaccade latencies made more antisaccade errors. The magnitude of the association did not differ between groups. No saccadic measure predicted conversion to psychosis within 2\u00a0years. These findings confirm the existence of antisaccade impairments in patients with schizophrenia and provide evidence that volitional response generation in the antisaccade task may be affected even before onset of clinically overt psychosis.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have aimed to identify subtypes of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) based on their age of onset (AOO). Obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders (OCS disorders) such as tic disorders have been particularly associated with an early onset in some studies. However, subtypes of early- and late-onset OCD are unevenly determined, and the biological and the clinical validity of these subtypes are unknown. This study was undertaken to discriminate the subtypes of OCD in different AOO levels and to test the hypothesis that different AOO bands are associated with a differential pattern of comorbidity.Two hundred fifty-two patients with OCD were interviewed directly with the German version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Lifetime Anxiety Version, which provides DSM-IV diagnosis. Subgroups with different ages of onset were investigated (cut-off levels of 10, 15, and 18 years).Subjects with an early AOO (onset < or =10 years) were significantly more likely to have OCS disorders (odds ratio [OR]=3.46; P=.001; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.72-6.96), in particular tic/Tourette's disorders (OR=4.63; P=.002; 95% CI: 1.78-12.05), than were late-onset subjects.For most mental disorders (e.g., anxiety and mood disorders), no associations with AOO of OCD were identified. However, subjects in the early-onset group (< or =10 years) had a significant increase in comorbid tic and Tourette's disorders. Future research should examine potential neurobiological features associated with early-onset presentations of OCD. Early detection and management of comorbidities may offset impairments later in life.",

        "abstract": "We used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) to examine biochemical characteristics of the brain tissue in subjects at risk for schizophrenia. Nineteen participants fulfilling research criteria for an early (n=10) or a late (n=9) at-risk syndrome, 21 patients with full disease according to DSM IV and 31 healthy control subjects were included in the study. Single-voxel 1H MRS was performed in the left frontal lobe, the anterior cingulate gyrus and the left superior temporal lobe. Subjects were followed longitudinally to detect conversion to schizophrenia. We observed a significant reduction of the metabolic ratios NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho in the left frontal lobe and of NAA/Cr in the anterior cingulate gyrus in both at-risk groups and in the schizophrenic patients compared with healthy controls. Those at-risk subjects, who converted to schizophrenia within the observation period, had a higher Cho/Cr and a lower NAA/Cho ratio in the anterior cingulate gyrus compared with non-converters. NAA/Cr did not differ between converters and non-converters. Six at-risk subjects were taking antidepressants, two were taking antipsychotics. There was no difference in any metabolic ratio in any region between at-risk subjects with and without medication. We conclude that the reduction of the neuronal marker NAA in the left prefrontal lobe and the anterior cingulate gyrus may represent a vulnerability indicator for schizophrenia in at-risk subjects, while elevated Cho in the anterior cingulate gyrus may be a predictor for conversion from the prodromal state to the full disease.",

        "abstract": "Rationale\u00a0\u00a0In animal studies, the common club drug 3,4-methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, \u201cEcstasy\u201d) consistently caused a prolonged loss of presynaptic serotonergic neurons, and evidence suggests that MDMA consumption may also affect the human serotonergic system. Serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in the regulation of impulsivity and such executive functions as decision-making cognition. In fact, MDMA users have shown elevated impulsivity in two studies, but little is known about decision making in drug-free MDMA consumers.Objective\u00a0\u00a0The aim of this study was to examine the cognitive neurotoxicity of MDMA with regard to behavioral impulsivity and decision-making cognition.Methods\u00a0\u00a0Nineteen male, abstinent, heavy MDMA users; 19 male, abstinent cannabis users; and 19 male, drug-na\u00efve controls were examined with the Matching Familiar Figures Test (MFFT) as well as with a Go/No-Go Task (GNG) for impulsivity and with a Gambling Task (GT) for executive functioning.Results\u00a0\u00a0MDMA users showed significantly elevated impulsivity in the MFFT Impulsivity score (I-score), but not in commission errors of the GNG, compared with controls. Cannabis users did not yield altered impulsivity compared with controls. In the GT, MDMA users performed significantly worse than cannabis consumers and controls, whereas cannabis users exhibited the same decision-making capacity as controls. In addition, the I-score as well as the decision-making performance was correlated with measures of MDMA intake. The I-score and the decision-making performance were also correlated.Conclusion\u00a0\u00a0These results suggest that heavy use of MDMA may elevate behavioral impulsivity and impair decision-making cognition possibly mediated by a selective impairment of the 5-HT system.",

We have assessed the impact of the functional C-1019G variant of the 5-HT1A receptor on the response to risperidone or haloperidol in a prospective, randomized, double-blind study. Patients were treated for 4 weeks and negative symptoms assessed weekly. The variant influenced the response to risperidone: improvement of negative symptoms by 4.38 points for carriers of the C allele, compared with the GG genotype (1.22 points, P=0.046). In a second independent study of 130 schizophrenia patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, this effect was confirmed (P=0.003). The functional variant of the 5-HT1A receptor thus influences the response of schizophrenia patients to atypical antipsychotics and may be useful in the future to predict the pharmacogenetics of negative symptoms.",

However, only few studies have examined the association between pretreatment characteristics and alliance formation in patients with schizophrenia.The study examined whether symptoms and insight would predict the therapeutic alliance in psychotherapy of schizophrenia. Further, the associations and differences between patient and therapist alliance ratings were studied.Eighty patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders received manual-based psychotherapy. Assessment of symptoms and insight was conducted at baseline, and questionnaire-based alliance ratings were obtained three weeks into treatment. Patient and therapist alliance ratings were examined separately.Patient and therapist alliance ratings were not significantly correlated (r=0.17). Patient ratings of the alliance were significantly higher than the ratings of their therapists (d=0.73). More insight in psychosis significantly predicted higher patient ratings of the alliance. Less positive and negative symptoms were significant predictors of higher therapist alliance ratings.The findings indicate that symptoms and insight have an influence on the therapeutic alliance in the treatment of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Patients' and therapists' perceptions of the alliance do not seem to demonstrate much convergence.",

By studying two rare patients with congenital lipoid proteinosis (Urbach-Wiethe) and a focal disease emphasis on the basolateral amygdala (BLA), we demonstrate that this bidirectional modification of episodic encoding by emotion depends on the integrity of the amygdala, as both retrograde and anterograde modulatory effects are absent. Our findings implicate the amygdala in a neural circuitry that orchestrates rapid retrograde and anterograde regulation of episodic memory access upon criteria of behavioral significance.",

        "abstract": "Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response (ASR) is an operational measure of sensorimotor gating and a promising endophenotype of schizophrenia. We have recently shown that the linked serotonin-2A receptor (5-HT(2A)R) A-1438 G and T102C polymorphisms modulate PPI in schizophrenia patients. Moreover, it was shown that genetic variation in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and the neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) proteins influences PPI in schizophrenia patients and healthy volunteers. Therefore, we aimed to replicate these results and investigated the impact of the related polymorphisms on PPI in healthy human volunteers.We analyzed the 5-HT(2A)R A-1438 G/T102C (rs6311/rs6313), the COMT Val158Met (rs4680), and the NRG-1 Arg38Gln (rs3924999) polymorphisms, assessing startle reactivity, habituation, and PPI of ASR in 107 healthy Caucasian volunteers.Subjects homozygous for the 5-HT(2A)R T102C-T/A-1438 G-A allele showed increased PPI levels. In particular, male subjects with the COMT Met158Met-genotype also showed elevated PPI. The NRG-1 Arg38Gln genotype did not have a significant impact on PPI. Startle reactivity was not affected by any of the investigated polymorphisms.We confirmed in an independent sample of healthy volunteers that PPI is influenced by genetic variation in the 5-HT(2A)R gene. The influence of the COMT Val158Met genotype on PPI appears to be sex-specific. These results underscore the significance of the serotonin and dopamine systems in the modulation of sensorimotor gating.",

        "abstract": "It was recently reported that a rare functional variant, R441H, in the human tryptophan hydroxylase-2 gene (hTPH2) could represent an important risk factor for unipolar major depression (UP) since it was originally found in 10% of UP patients (vs. 1.4% in control subjects).We explored the occurrence of this variation in patients with affective disorders (n = 646), autism spectrum disorders (n = 224), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (n = 201); in healthy volunteers with no psychiatric disorders (n = 246); and in an ethnic panel of control individuals from North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, India, China, and Sweden (n = 277).Surprisingly, we did not observe the R441H variant in any of the individuals screened (3188 independent chromosomes).Our results do not confirm the role of the R441H mutation of the hTPH2 gene in the susceptibility to UP. The absence of the variant from a large cohort of psychiatric patients and control subjects suggests that the findings reported in the original study could be due to a genotyping error or to stratification of the initial population reported. Additional data by other groups should contribute to the clarification of the discrepancy between our results and those previous published.",

        "abstract": "As effective and practical approaches to primary and universal prevention of psychosis are lacking, intervention efforts are targeted at the early stages of schizophrenia to prevent (by way of secondary prevention) or postpone psychosis onset, reduce severity of illness or at least ameliorate the social consequences involved. Early intervention requires early detection and early recognition (diagnosis) of persons at risk and early prediction of psychosis. Within the German Research Network on Schizophrenia (GRNS) awareness programmes are being carried out in several German cities, and these efforts are already improving utilisation of early-recognition and early-prediction services by at risk persons. The empirical basis of developing a two-step early-recognition inventory and strategies of application will be discussed. This instrument is supplemented by a set of cognitive tests, prospectively validated in the GRNS. Results from preliminary analysis of data covering a two-year period demonstrate that the inventory and the cognitive tests are readily accepted. When used for screening in non-specialist settings and at the next level, i. e. at early-recognition centres, they seem to permit identification of at-risk persons. Early intervention is being tested 1) in a randomised controlled multi-centre trial consisting of a specially developed cognitive-behavioural therapy in the early (prepsychotic) prodromal state and 2) on additional treatment with appropriate doses of amisulpride in the late prodromal (early psychotic) state. Preliminary data from Study 1 covering 16.3 months show significantly fewer transitions to psychosis and from Study 2 reduced positive and negative symptoms and improved global functioning compared with controls who had received normal clinical treatment. As a result, both the early-recognition inventory plus cognitive tests and the two therapy strategies are feasible. We hope that the favourable trend indicated by the preliminary data will be confirmed in the final analysis planned for 2005 and the objective of implementing effective and practical secondary prevention of psychosis and its consequences will be attained.",

Recent studies suggested that PPI deficits and habituation deficits are normalized after antipsychotic treatment. Despite clear evidence of gating and habituation mechanisms in animal models, it is still unknown which neurotransmitter systems are involved in schizophrenic patients. Thus, we compared the effects of a combined 5-HT2A/D2 and a pure D2/D3 antagonist on PPI and habituation of ASR in patients with schizophrenia.The ASR was measured in 37 acute schizophrenic patients who were randomized and double-blinded as to treatment with amisulpride or olanzapine. Patients were assessed during the first week and after four and eight weeks of treatment. Twenty healthy matched control subjects were examined likewise.Schizophrenic patients showed a significant PPI deficit and significantly decreased startle amplitude at baseline. The gating deficit disappeared after antipsychotic treatment in both treatment groups. Amisulpride sensitized the startle amplitude, whereas startle amplitude was not changed by olanzapine. After correcting for startle amplitude, patients did not show a habituation deficit; however, amisulpride accelerated habituation, whereas olanzapine had no effect.Our findings suggest that the PPI-restoring effect of antipsychotics is probably attributed to a dopamine D2 receptor blockade.",

        "title": "Support for the association between the rare functional variant I425V of the serotonin transporter gene and susceptibility to obsessive compulsive disorder.",
        "abstract": "SIR\u2014Recently, a rare functional variant, I425V, in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) has been reported to be associated with a complex neuropsychiatric phenotype that includes obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD), alcohol abuse/dependence, anorexia nervosa, and pervasive developmental disorder (PDD).1 Our study, performed in a large population of patients with these disorders, confirms the occurrence and the segregation of V425 in OCD. The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) has been implicated in numerous psychiatric disorders, mostly because of the efficacy of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs). Among the polymorphisms identified in SLC6A4, three have been shown to be functional. The rare I425V variation, located in exon 9, increases the transport activity of the protein,2 whereas the two more frequent polymorphisms, 5-HTTLPR located in the 5'-UTR of the gene, and STin2 located in intron 2, modify the transcriptional activity of the gene.3, 4 Despite a large number of studies, the functional implications of the two frequent SLC6A4 polymorphisms in psychiatric disorders are still a matter of debate. In the present study, we sought to further explore the influence of the rare but clearly functional I425V variant in a large sample of patients with OCD and other psychiatric conditions previously reported in the two families carrying I425V, that is, PDD, anorexia nervosa, and alcohol abuse/dependence. To be included in the study, patients had to meet the DSM-IV criteria for OCD, anorexia nervosa, alcohol abuse/dependence, or PDD. The diagnosis of PDD was confirmed using the Autism Diagnostic Interview\u2014Revised.5 For the other disorders, lifetime psychiatric evaluation was carried out using the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS)6 for adult patients, or the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for children.7 Healthy controls were included after being interviewed with the DIGS and the Family Interview for Genetic Studies8 to confirm the absence of both personal and family history of major psychiatric disorders. The local Research Ethics Boards reviewed and approved the study. The V425 was found in 3/254 probands with OCD, 1/284 with PDD, 1/124 with anorexia nervosa, in 1/285 healthy controls, but not in alcohol abusers/dependents (0/128) (Table 1). In OCD family 1, V425 was transmitted by the father who also had a lifetime history of OCD and single phobia. The paternal grandfather was alcoholic and tobacco dependant (died of throat cancer). The grandmother had no history of major psychiatric disorders (died of breast cancer). No DNA was available for the paternal grandparents. In OCD family 2, the mother and two siblings of the proband had committed suicide and the father was also dead, so no DNA was available for these individuals. OCD case 1 had only one brother, who committed suicide some years ago, and no DNA was available. No other clinical data were available concerning the first-degree relatives of OCD case 1. In PDD family 1, V425 was transmitted by the father and was present in the proband and two brothers. The father and one of the brothers carrying the V425 were both alcohol dependent. However, the youngest brother (19 years old), also carrying the V425 variant, did not suffer from alcoholism or any other psychiatric disorder at the time of evaluation. Our results are in accordance with those previously reported by Ozaki et al1 on four points. First, we report a possibly higher occurrence of the V425 variant in OCD compared to controls. Although the variant is rare, the combined results of the two studies indicate a significantly higher frequency of V425 in OCD compared to controls1, 9 (5/457 vs 2/884, Fisher's exact test, P=0.02). Second, despite the limited clinical and genotypic information on the families carrying the V425 variant, our results suggest a possible cosegregation between the V425 and neuropsychiatric phenotypes, specifically in OCD. Third, Ozaki et al hypothesized that the V425 variant may confer treatment resistance to SRIs. This was indirectly supported by our findings since all OCD probands carrying the V425 variant in our study were considered resistant to SRIs, that is, the severity of their obsessive and compulsive symptoms decreased less than 25% with multiple trials of a high dose of SRIs and a good compliance. Specifically, the three probands with OCD carrying the variant showed poor or no response to multiple trials of SRIs at adequate doses over several years. Fourth, the analysis of the two additional polymorphisms of the SCL6A4 gene indicated that the V425 polymorphism might be associated with the L allele of 5-HTTLPR. However, our results do not confirm the hypothesis of a combined gain of functional effect of both V425 and L/L genotype as a genetic risk for OCD, since this combined genotype was not present in all affected patients and, by contrast, was present in the control subject carrying the V425 variant. In conclusion, our results are similar to those of the original report by Ozaki et al and, therefore, lend support for a role of SLC6A4 V425 in the susceptibility to complex neuropsychiatric phenotypes. However, due to its global low frequency and to the fact that it was detected in a few controls, the role of V425 remains uncertain and should be interpreted with caution. We encourage other investigators, especially in the field of OCD, to screen for V425 in their samples. Indeed, the replication of these findings could ultimately implicate SLC6A4 as a true susceptibility gene to complex neuropsychiatric disorders, and consequently shed further light on the results obtained with the more frequent polymorphisms.",

        "abstract": "Repeated drug use modifies the emotional and cognitive processing of drug-associated cues. These changes are supposed to persist even after prolonged abstinence. Several studies demonstrated that smoking cues selectively attract the attention of smokers, but empirical evidence for such an attentional bias among successful quitters is inconclusive. Here, we investigated whether attentional biases persist after smoking cessation. Thirty-eight former smokers, 34 current smokers, and 29 non-smokers participated in a single experimental session. We used three measures of attentional bias for smoking stimuli: A visual probe task with short (500ms) and long (2000ms) picture stimulus durations, and a modified Stroop task with smoking-related and neutral words. Former smokers and current smokers, as compared to non-smokers, showed an attentional bias in visual orienting to smoking pictures in the 500ms condition of the visual probe task. The Stroop interference index of smoking words was negatively related to nicotine dependence in current smokers. Former smokers and mildly dependent smokers, as compared to non-smokers, showed increased interference by smoking words in the Stroop task. Neither current nor former smokers showed an attentional bias in maintained attention (2000ms visual probe task). In conclusion, even after prolonged abstinence smoking cues retain incentive salience in former smokers, who differed from non-smokers on two attentional bias indices. Attentional biases in former smokers operate mainly in early involuntary rather than in controlled processing, and may represent a vulnerability factor for relapse. Therefore, smoking cessation programs should strengthen self-control abilities to prevent relapses.",

        "abstract": "Given that previous studies demonstrated that smoking-related cues (like cigarette packages) grab the attention of smokers and thereby contribute to craving and tobacco seeking we investigated how pictorial health warnings presented on cigarette packages affect attention allocation towards cigarette packages. The WHO advises the use of pictorial health warnings on cigarette packages. However, at present no experimental studies are available investigating if pictorial warnings modulate incentive properties of cigarette packages. Fifty-nine tobacco smokers and 55 non-smokers performed a visual dot probe task to assess attention allocation towards cigarette packages with and without health warnings. Smokers were divided a priori in a group of light smokers (<20 cigarettes/day; n=39) and heavy smokers (\u226520 cigarettes/day; n=20). Psychometric measures on anxiety and nicotine craving were administered. Light smokers showed an attentional bias towards packages without pictorial warnings while no effects were observed in the other groups. In heavy smokers attention allocation towards pictorial health warnings was associated with an increase of craving and anxiety. The results have a potential public health perspective as pictorial health warnings might be an effective strategy to reduce attentional bias towards cigarette packages of light smokers, while counterproductive effects in heavy smokers warrant further investigation.",

The exact way in which genetic variation in NRG1 might impact on this susceptibility for the disorder is a focus of current research. The present study aimed at investigating the possible relationship between a putative NRG1 at-risk haplotype (HAP ICE ) and hippocampal volumes in schizophrenic patients and their healthy first-degree relatives. We genotyped 30 schizophrenic patients and 52 non-affected family members with regard to the presence or absence of the NRG1 haplotype HAP ICE . Structural magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine hippocampal brain volumes in the same subjects. Patients and relatives carrying haplotype HAP ICE both had smaller relative hippocampal volumes as compared to patients or relatives who did not carry this haplotype. These findings provide first direct evidence for a link between NRG1 genetic variation and hippocampal volume reductions in schizophrenic patients and non-affected relatives. This preliminary evidence may help to guide further research into the pathophysiological pathways that underlie this genetic susceptibility for schizophrenia.",

Studies with rodents suggest that an increase or decrease in serotonin level in the brain alters several modalities of the ASR. So far, little is known about serotonergic and noradrenergic startle modulation in humans.This study was designed to investigate the effects of the selective serotonin uptake inhibitor sertraline versus the selective noradrenalin uptake inhibitor reboxetine on magnitude, habituation and PPI of ASR in patients with major depression.We studied ASR in 23 patients with the diagnosis of major depression according to DSM-IV who were randomly treated either with sertraline or with reboxetine. Initially, ASR assessment was carried out when patients were drug-free for at least 2 weeks and again after 14 days of treatment.The habituation of ASR was strongly attenuated by sertraline and not significantly altered by reboxetine. None of the substances altered the startle reactivity. In addition, PPI was not altered by sertraline, but reboxetine tended to decrease PPI. The startle reactivity at baseline was correlated with improvement of depressive symptoms at the end of the study.These results provide the first evidence for different effects of noradrenergic and serotonergic antidepressants on the startle response in depressed patients.",

The respective data from the German Study on Aging, Cognition and Dementia in Primary Care Patients (AgeCoDe) also showing risk increase (hazard ratio = 2.081) are reported here. The mechanisms by which the risk increase is transported are still unknown. Irritation of compensated alterations of cholinergic transmission at the pre-dementia stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or acceleration of neuroinflammation by disturbance of the anti-inflammatory effect of cholinergic innervation are discussed. In terms of dementia prevention, centrally acting anticholinergic drugs should be strictly avoided, because of long-term dementia risk increase in addition to acute negative effects on cognition.",

        "abstract": "We examined whether the cognitive dispute of psychotic symptoms has a negative impact on the course of the therapeutic alliance. Sixty-seven patients with persistent psychotic symptoms received either cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or supportive therapy. Questionnaire-based alliance ratings were repeatedly obtained throughout the course of therapy. Patient and therapist alliance ratings were examined separately. Data analyses comprised repeated measurement analyses of variance and cluster analytic procedures. Neither patient nor therapist alliance ratings showed a differential course throughout the treatments. This was despite the implementation of disputing strategies in later stages of CBT. Irrespective of the treatment condition a cluster with a positive alliance rating and a cluster with a poorer rating were found for therapist and patient ratings, respectively. Baseline symptoms and insight differentiated between the types of clusters. In conclusion, CBT-specific interventions that challenge psychotic symptoms do not necessarily negatively influence the course of the alliance.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive functions show large variation in elderly people and are substantially heritable. Animal studies revealed that dynorphins influence cognition and memory, especially in aged animals. Thus, we tested the effect of four SNPs (rs7272891, rs1997794, rs2235751 and rs910080) and the VNTR promoter polymorphism in the prodynorphin gene (PDYN) on episodic memory and verbal fluency in a large (n = 1619) sample of elderly people (mean age: 80 +/- 3.39 years; range 75-90 years) recruited through the German study on ageing, cognition and dementia in primary care patients (AgeCoDe). We found that carriers of the minor alleles of rs1997794 (P < 0.002) and rs910080 (P < 0.005) presented with higher episodic memory scores than homozygote carriers of the major allele. Also, a three marker haplotype including these two SNPs and rs2235751 was associated with better episodic memory scores. Verbal fluency scores were non-significantly better in carriers of these respective alleles. Thus, our results suggest a role of PDYN gene variations in determining memory function also in elderly humans.",

To detect volumetric changes in ALIC, including the influence of genetic factors, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of families affected with schizophrenia was performed.The study sample comprised 22 family members with schizophrenia (FM-SZ), 34 family members without schizophrenia (FM-NSZ), and 43 control subjects. In addition to manual tracing of ALIC, subjects underwent proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the left prefrontal cortex, psychopathological rating, and neuropsychological assessment of frontal lobe function.Compared with controls, a significant reduction of right ALIC volume was seen in all family members (12%-16% reduction, p < .01) and a reduction of left ALIC volume in FM-NSZ (10% reduction, p = .028) was also observed. Both groups of family members showed a bilateral reduction in maximal cross sectional area of the ALIC. FM-SZ performed significantly worse on neurocognitive measures (Subject Ordered Pointing Task [SOPT] and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test), and performance correlated negatively with the ALIC volume (SOPT, r = -.6, p = .03).A reduced volume of ALIC in affected families supports the hypothesis of disturbed frontothalamic connectivity in schizophrenia and demonstrates functional relevance by an association with reduced neurocognitive performance.",

Accordingly, genetic variation of serotonin receptors can be expected to affect memory and to underlie, in part, the heritability of memory capacity. A study by de Quervain and colleagues found a highly significant association of the functional 5-HT2A receptor variant His452Tyr (rs6314) with long-term memory. We replicated this finding in a cohort of 133 adults (mean age 43.5 yr). Carriers of the Tyr allele showed poorer verbal delayed recall and recognition, while immediate recall and additional measures of attentional and executive function were not affected by the His452Tyr genotype. Results suggest a possible role of 5-HT2A receptors in memory consolidation. Serotonergic drugs may have the potential to improve memory.",

        "abstract": "The role of genetic risk markers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in mediating the neurocognitive endophenotypes (NEs) of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has rarely been studied. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between well-known AD-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and individual NEs routinely evaluated during diagnosis of MCI, AD, and other dementias. The Fundaci\u00f3 ACE (ACE) dataset, comprising information from 1245 patients with MCI, was analyzed, including the total sample, amnestic MCI (aMCI) ( = 811), and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI) ( = 434). As probable-MCI (Pr-MCI) patients with memory impairment have a higher risk of AD, which could influence the statistical power to detect genetic associations, the MCI phenotype was also stratified into four related conditions: Pr-aMCI ( = 262), Pr-naMCI ( = 76), possible (Pss)-aMCI ( = 549), and Pss-naMCI ( = 358). Validation analyses were performed using data from the German study on Aging, Cognition, and Dementia in primary care patients (AgeCoDe), and the German Dementia Competence Network (DCN). SNP associations with NEs were calculated in PLINK using multivariate linear regression analysis adjusted for age, gender, and education. In the total MCI sample, -\u03b54 was significantly associated with the memory function NEs \"delayed recall (DR)\" (\u03b2 = -0.76,  = 4.1 \u00d7 10), \"learning\" (\u03b2 = -1.35,  = 2.91 \u00d7 10), and \"recognition memory\" (\u03b2 = -0.58,  = 9.67 \u00d7 10); and with \"DR\" in the aMCI group (\u03b2 = -0.36,  = 2.96 \u00d7 10). These results were confirmed by validation in the AgeCoDe ( = 503) and DCN ( = 583) datasets. -\u03b54 was also significantly associated with the NE \"learning\" in individuals classified as having Pss-aMCI (\u03b2 = -1.37,  = 5.82 \u00d7 10). Moreover, there was a near study-wide significant association between the  locus (rs6448799) and the \"backward digits\" working memory NE (\u03b2 = 0.52,  = 7.57 \u00d7 10) among individuals with Pr-aMCI, while the  locus (rs10751667) was significantly associated with the language NE \"repetition\" (\u03b2 = -0.19,  = 5.34 \u00d7 10). Overall, our findings support specific associations of established AD-associated SNPs with MCI NEs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract  Introduction  We evaluated the effect of Alzheimeru0027s disease (AD) susceptibility loci on endophenotypes closely related with AD pathology in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).  Methods  We selected 1730 MCI patients from four independent data sets. Weighted polygenic risk scores (PGS) were constructed of 18 non-apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) AD risk variants. In addition, we determined  APOE  genotype. AD endophenotypes were cognitive decline over time and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (a\u03b2, tau, ptau).  Results  PGS was modestly associated with cognitive decline over time, as measured by mini-mental state examination (MMSE) (\u03b2 \u00b1 SE:\u22120.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10;  P \u00a0=\u00a0.012), and with CSF levels of tau and ptau (tau: 1.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.36,  P \u00a0=\u00a01.21 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ; ptau: 1.40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.36,  P \u00a0=\u00a01.02 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ).  Discussion  In MCI, we observed a joint effect of AD susceptibility loci on nonamyloid endophenotypes, suggesting a link of these genetic loci with neuronal degeneration in general rather than with Alzheimer-related amyloid deposition.",

        "abstract": "Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) patients are considered as a risk population for preclinical Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Supporting this idea, previous studies in SCD populations report subtle alterations in various cognitive and neuroimaging biomarkers that are typically affected during AD progression. To extend these observations, the present study examined whether SCD patients show atrophy of cholinergic basal forebrain nuclei (chBFN), analogous with recent findings in prodromal and clinical AD patients. We assessed volume reductions of the chBFN in 24 SCD subjects compared to 49 matched controls on 3D-T1-weighted MR images based on a postmortem derived atlas. Furthermore, we assessed whether chBFN atrophy was linked with cognitive, structural and metabolic biomarker alterations we previously reported in this SCD cohort: Using correlation analyses we tested for associations between the volumes of the chBFN with the hippocampal gray matter volume, and posterior medial glucose consumption, and the trajectory of verbal memory performance. The SCD cases showed a significant total volume reduction of the chBFN, with largest effect sizes in the Ch1/2 and Ch4p subdivisions of the chBFN. The latter was associated with a reduced glucose metabolism in the precuneus for the SCD group only. These data show an early involvement of the cholinergic basal forebrain nuclei in SCD predominantly in Ch1/2 and Ch4p which supports the conceptual link between SCD and preclinical AD.",

        "abstract": "Sensorimotor gating measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response (ASR) has been proposed as one of the most promising electrophysiological endophenotypes of schizophrenia. During the past decade, a number of publications have reported significant associations between genetic polymorphisms and PPI in samples of schizophrenia patients and healthy volunteers. However, an overall evaluation of the robustness of these results has not been published so far. Therefore, we performed the first meta-analysis of published and unpublished associations between gene polymorphisms and PPI of ASR. Unpublished associations between genetic polymorphisms and PPI were derived from three independent samples. In total, 120 single observations from 16 independent samples with 2660 study participants and 43 polymorphisms were included. After correction for multiple testing based on false discovery rate and considering the number of analyzed polymorphisms, significant associations were shown for four variants, even though none of these associations survived a genome-wide correction (P<5\u221710). These results imply that PPI might be modulated by four genotypes - COMT rs4680 (primarily in males), GRIK3 rs1027599, TCF4 rs9960767, and PRODH rs385440 - indicating a role of these gene variations in the development of early information processing deficits in schizophrenia. However, the overall impact of single genes on PPI is still rather small suggesting that PPI is - like the disease phenotype - highly polygenic. Future genome-wide analyses studies with large sample sizes will enhance our understanding on the genetic architecture of PPI.",

        "abstract": "Preclinical and clinical data suggest modulating effects of appetite-regulating hormones and stress perception on food intake. Nicotine intake also interferes with regulation of body weight. Especially following smoking cessation gaining weight is a common but only partially understood consequence. The aim of this study was to examine the interaction between smoking habits, the appetite regulating hormone leptin, negative affectivity, and stress vulnerability on eating behavior in a clinical case\u2013control study under standardized conditions. In a large population-based study sample, we compared leptin and cortisol plasma concentrations (radioimmunoassay) between current tobacco smokers with high cognitive restraint and disinhibition in eating behavior and smokers scoring low in both categories as assessed with the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ; Stunkard & Messick, 1985). As a measure for smoking effects on the stress axis, the saliva cortisol concentrations were compared before and after nicotine smoking. Additionally, stress perception was assessed with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), symptoms of depression and anxiety with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). In smokers showing high cognitive restraint and disinhibition we found significantly higher leptin concentrations than in the group of smokers scoring low in both categories. Furthermore there was a significant group difference in saliva cortisol concentrations after nicotine intake. Smokers showing high cognitive restraint and disinhibition were also characterized by significantly higher scores in the STAI, the PSS and the BDI. Our results suggest that smokers with a pathological eating behavior show an impaired neuroendocrine regulation of appetite and are prone to experience higher levels of stress and negative affectivity. This interaction of behavioral and neuroendocrinological factors may constitute a high risk condition for gaining weight following smoking cessation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is one of the most common factors underlying the high rate of mortality observed in patients with schizophrenia. Recent research on this topic revealed that many of the patients studied were, in fact, in a medicated state. As such, it is unclear whether MetS is causally associated with the disorder itself or the medication used to treat it. In this study, patients with a clinically high risk of expressing first episode psychosis (CHR) were examined regarding the prevalence of MetS.  N \u00a0=\u00a0144 unmedicated and antipsychotic-naive CHR patients, aged between 18 and 42\u00a0years and suffering from unmanifested prodromal symptoms, were compared with a cohort of  N \u00a0=\u00a03995 individuals from the \u201cGerman Metabolic and Cardiovascular Risk Study\u201d (GEMCAS). A slightly higher prevalence of individual MetS criteria was observed in the CHR group compared to the GEMCAS sample; specifically, the following were noted: a higher blood pressure (35.0% vs. 28.0%), increased waist circumference (17.6% vs. 15.1%), and increased fasting blood glucose (9.4% vs. 4.0%) in CHR patients. Additionally, the rate of reduced HDL cholesterol concentrations was lower in the control group (20.2% vs. 13.3%).",

In patients treated with rTMS, cognitive performance remained constant or improved and memory complaints alleviated, whereas in the ECT group memory recall deficits emerged and memory complaints remained.In contrast to unilateral ECT, rTMS has no adverse memory effects.",

        "abstract": "We recently published findings in this journal on the prevalence of mental disorders from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults Mental Health Module (DEGS1-MH). The DEGS1-MH paper was also meant to be the major reference publication for this large-scale German study program, allowing future users of the data set to understand how the study was conducted and analyzed. Thus, towards this goal highest standards regarding transparency, consistency and reproducibility should be applied. After publication, unfortunately, the need for an addendum and corrigendum became apparent due to changes in the eligible reference sample, and corresponding corrections of the imputed data. As a consequence the sample description, sample size and some prevalence data needed amendments. Additionally we identified a coding error in the algorithm for major depression that had a significant effect on the prevalence estimates of depression and associated conditions. This addendum and corrigendum highlights all changes and presents the corrected prevalence tables. Copyright \u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ",

        "abstract": ": Evidence whether single &ldquo;cognitive health&rdquo; foods could prevent cognitive decline is limited. We investigated whether dietary intake of red wine, white wine, coffee, green tea, olive oil, fresh fish, fruits and vegetables, red meat and sausages, assessed by a single-food-questionnaire, would be associated with either incident Alzheimer&rsquo;s dementia (AD) or verbal memory decline.  Participants aged 75+ of the German Study on Aging, Cognition and Dementia in Primary Care Patients (AgeCoDe) cohort were regularly followed over 10 years ( = 2622;  = 418 incident AD cases). Multivariable-adjusted joint modeling of repeated-measures and survival analysis was used, taking gender and Apolipoprotein E4 ( &epsilon;4) genotype into account as possible effect modifiers. : Only higher red wine intake was associated with a lower incidence of AD ( = 0.92;  = 0.045). Interestingly, this was true only for men ( = 0.82;  < 0.001), while in women higher red wine intake was associated with a higher incidence of AD ( = 1.15;  = 0.044), and higher white wine intake with a more pronounced memory decline over time ( = &minus;0.13;  = 0.052). : We found no evidence for these single foods to be protective against cognitive decline, with the exception of red wine, which reduced the risk for AD only in men. Women could be more susceptible to detrimental effects of alcohol.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Background  Depression is the most common psychiatric disease in older people, often accompanied by co-morbidities and functional limitations. In cross-sectional studies, depression is associated with an increased use of health care resources, including informal care and home care. Longitudinal data are needed to better understand the causal links between depression, functional impairments, and health care utilization.    Methods  Data were obtained at baseline and follow-up of the multicenter, prospective cohort study \u201cLate life depression in primary care: needs, health care utilization and costs\u201d (AgeMooDe). A sample of 955 primary care patients aged 75 years and older was interviewed twice. The primary outcomes were the average respective amounts of time spent utilizing home care, professional nursing care, domestic help and informal care. These outcomes were analyzed with Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM).    Results  GLMM analysis revealed that the amount of time utilizing home care over the study period was positively associated with depression, higher age, and functional and cognitive impairments, but negatively associated with living alone. In-depth analyses revealed that these associations were particularly obvious for the utilization of informal care.    Limitations  The generalizability of our findings may be limited due to use of a dimensional instrument to determine depressive symptoms.    Conclusions  Over the study period, the average amount of time receiving home care and especially informal care increased in the group of patients with depression only. People with depressive symptoms experience a growing number of functional limitations over time, increasing their dependency on others. Functional limitations, depression and dependency appear to form a vicious cycle.",

        "abstract": "Abstract  Introduction  Previous studies have demonstrated that an overall high level of mental work demands decreased dementia risk. In our study, we investigated whether this effect is driven by specific mental work demands and whether it is exposure dependent.  Methods  Patients aged 75+\u00a0years were recruited from general practitioners and participated in up to seven assessment waves (every 1.5\u00a0years) of the longitudinal AgeCoDe study. Analyses of the impact of specific mental work demands on dementia risk were carried out via multivariate regression modeling (n\u00a0=\u00a02315).  Results  We observed a significantly lower dementia risk in individuals with a higher level of information processing (HR, 0.888), pattern detection (HR, 0.878), mathematics (HR, 0.878), and creativity (HR, 0.878). Yet, exposure-dependent effects were only significant for information processing and pattern detection.  Discussion  Our longitudinal observations suggest that dementia risk may be reduced by some but not all types of mental work demands.",

They were observed every 1.5 years over four waves.Individuals aged 77-101 at follow-up Wave 2 (N = 2,394).Physical and cognitive function were assessed using an adapted scale that had been previously developed, and visual impairment was rated on a Likert scale (none, mild, severe or profound).Adjusting for sociodemographic factors and comorbidity, linear fixed-effects regression showed that the onset of severe visual impairment was associated with a decline in physical function score in the total sample (? = -0.15, P = .01) and in women (? = -.15, P = .03). Moreover, the onset of severe visual impairment was associated with decline in cognitive function score in the total sample (? = -0.38, Pu003c .001) and in women (? = -0.38, Pu003c .001) and men (? = -0.37, P = .001).Visual impairment affects physical and cognitive function in old age. Interventional strategies to postpone visual impairment may contribute to maintaining physical and cognitive function.",

As they have common causes and risk factors, coronary heart disease (CHD) could influence the course of dementia.  Aim  To determine whether CHD increases the speed of cognitive decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and to discuss the potential for secondary cardiovascular prevention to modify this decline.  Design and setting  Prospective multicentre cohort study in general practices in six cities in Germany.  Method  Participants were patients with probable mild-to-moderate Alzheimer\u2019s dementia or mixed dementia ( n  = 118; mean age 85.6 [\u00b13.4] years, range 80\u201396 years). The authors assessed the presence of CHD according to the family physicians\u2019 diagnosis. Cognitive performance was measured during home visits for up to 3 years in intervals of 6 months, using Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SoB). The authors also recorded whether patients died in the observation period.  Results  At baseline, 65 patients (55%) had CHD and/or a heart condition following a myocardial infarction. The presence of CHD accelerated cognitive decline (MMSE,  P  P   Conclusion  The study shows that CHD has a significant influence on cognitive decline in older patients with late-onset dementia. The dementia process might therefore be positively influenced by cardiovascular prevention, and this possible effect should be further investigated.",

        "abstract": " Anxiety in adults is a common mental health problem. However, studies on anxiety in the oldest-old are lacking. We sought to identify the age- and gender-specific prevalence of anxiety symptoms in a large sample of general practice patients. Furthermore, we investigated relevant associations of anxiety specifically with respect to recent experience of loss.  Based on the German Study on Ageing, Cognition and Dementia in general practice patients, a sample of 897 patients aged 82\u00a0years and older was assessed. Anxiety was assessed using the short form of the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI-SF). For the assessment of loss, patients were asked whether there were cases of death in their closer social environment since the last assessment. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were run.  Of the oldest-old individuals (aged 82+\u00a0years, mean age: 86.8), 14.5% (95% CI 12.4-16.8) suffered from anxiety symptoms. Highest prevalence rates were found for 82- to 85-year-old women (17.2%, 95% CI 12.6-22.1) and for 86- to 90-year-old patients (both sexes) in general (15.9%, 95% CI 12.6-19.2). Older individuals who experienced cases of death in their close social environment within the last 18\u00a0months had almost twice the odds [odds ratio (OR) 1.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-3.17] of reporting anxiety compared to those without a recent loss. As expected, depression and impaired cognitive status were associated with the presence of anxiety symptoms. No relation was found between social network, gender, age, frailty, or physical illness and anxiety in regression analysis.  This study provides for the first time age- and gender-specific prevalence rates of anxiety symptoms and associated risk factors among a large population-based sample of oldest-old primary care attenders. Anxiety is highly prevalent in individuals aged 82\u00a0years and older. Depression, impaired cognitive status, and recent experience of loss are associated with late-life anxiety. Our findings support the idea that recent experience of loss should be taken seriously in the context of clinical practice with respect to diagnosing and treating anxiety in old age.",

        "abstract": "Objective  To examine whether depressive symptoms affect healthcare costs in old age longitudinally.  Design  Multicenter prospective observational cohort study (two waves with n t1 \u2009=\u20091,195 and n t2 \u2009=\u2009951) in Germany.  Setting  Community.  Participants  Participants aged 75 years and older recruited via general practitioners.  Measurements  Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). The health-related resource use was measured retrospectively from a societal perspective based on a questionnaire, covering outpatient services, inpatient treatment, pharmaceuticals, as well as formal and informal nursing care. Hybrid regression models were used to determine the between- and within-effect of depressive symptoms on healthcare costs, adjusting for important covariates.  Results  Six-month total cost increased from \u20ac3,090 (t1) to \u20ac3,748 (t2). The hybrid random effects models showed that individuals with more depressive symptoms had higher healthcare costs compared with individuals with less depressive symptoms (between-effect). Moreover, an intra-individual increase in depressive symptoms increased healthcare costs by \u20ac539.60 (within-effect) per symptom on GDS.  Conclusions  Our findings emphasize the economic importance of depressive symptoms in old age. Appropriate interventions to treat depressive symptoms in old age might also be a promising strategy to reduce healthcare costs.",

Using genetically modified zebrafish, Golzio and colleagues identified KCTD13 within 16p11.2 as a major driver of the neuropsychiatric phenotype observed in humans. The aims of the present study were to explore the role of KCTD13 in the development of SCZ and to provide a more complete picture of the allelic architecture at this risk locus. The exons of KCTD13 were sequenced in 576 patients. The mutations c.6G>T and c.598G>A were identified in one patient each. Both mutations were predicted to be functionally relevant and were absent from the 1000 Genomes Project data and the Exome Variant Server. The mutation c.6G>T was predicted to abolish a potential transcription factor-binding site for specifity protein 1. Altered specifity protein 1 expression has been reported in SCZ patients compared with controls. Further studies in large cohorts are warranted to determine the relevance of the two identified mutations.",

        "abstract": "Cognition in schizophrenia cases is more strongly associated with PRS that index cognitive traits in the general population than PRS for neuropsychiatric disorders. This suggests the mechanisms of cognitive variation within schizophrenia are at least partly independent from those that predispose to schizophrenia diagnosis itself. Our findings indicate that this cognitive variation arises at least in part due to genetic factors shared with cognitive performance in populations and is not solely due to illness or treatment-related factors, although our findings are consistent with important contributions from these factors.",

Here, we aimed to replicate and extend these findings in a large, independent sample. One hundred and fifteen patients with OCD, 103 healthy comparison subjects without a family history of OCD, and 31 unaffected first-degree relatives of OCD patients were examined using structured clinical interviews and performed a volitional saccade task as well as a prosaccade task. In contrast to previous reports, neither patients nor relatives showed impairments in the performance of volitional saccades compared to healthy controls. Notably, medicated patients did not differ from nonmedicated patients, and there was no effect of depressive comorbidity. Additional analyses investigating correlations between saccade performance and OCD symptom dimensions yielded no significant associations. In conclusion, the present results do not support the notion that volitional saccade execution constitutes an endophenotype of OCD. Possible explanations for inconsistencies with previous studies are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Frontal electroencephalographic alpha asymmetry as an indicator of trait approach and trait inhibition systems has previously been studied in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with mixed results. We explored frontal alpha asymmetry as a possible risk factor in OCD by investigating a large sample of OCD patients (n = 113), healthy control participants (n = 113), and unaffected 1st-degree relatives of OCD patients (n = 37). Additionally, the relationship between OCD symptom dimensions and frontal alpha asymmetry was explored. OCD patients and healthy control participants did not differ in alpha asymmetry scores. Hence, the current results do not support the notion that OCD as a diagnostic entity is associated with a shift in frontal cortical activity. Furthermore, alpha asymmetry scores were not statistically related to specific OCD symptom dimensions. Reasons for inconsistent results in OCD are discussed and should be explored in future studies. Compared to OCD patients and healthy control participants, unaffected 1st-degree relatives of OCD patients showed increased left frontal activity. Such asymmetry has previously been found to be associated with positive affect and adaptive emotion regulation under stress. Because stressful life events play an important role in the onset and exacerbation of OCD, increased left frontal activity might serve as a resilience factor in unaffected 1st-degree relatives. Future studies should follow up on these results with longitudinal risk studies and pre- and posttherapy assessments to further explore causality of this putative factor. (PsycINFO Database Record",

        "abstract": "Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) show dysfunctions of the fronto-striatal circuitry, which imply corresponding oculomotor deficits including smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM). However, evidence for a deficit in SPEM is inconclusive, with some studies reporting reduced velocity gain while others did not find any SPEM dysfunctions in OCD patients. Interestingly, psychosis-like traits have repeatedly been linked to both OCD and impaired SPEM. Here, we examined a large sample of n\u2009=\u2009168 patients with OCD, n\u2009=\u200993 unaffected first-degree relatives and n\u2009=\u2009171 healthy control subjects to investigate whether elevated levels of schizotypy and SPEM deficits represent potential endophenotypes of OCD. We applied a SPEM task with high demands on predictive pursuit that is more sensitive to assess executive dysfunctions than a standard task with continuous visual feedback, as episodes of target blanking put increased demands on basal ganglia and prefrontal involvement. Additionally, we examined the relation between schizotypy and SPEM performance in OCD patients and their relatives. Results indicate that OCD patients and unaffected relatives do not show deficient performance in either standard or predictive SPEM. Yet, both patients and relatives exhibited elevated levels of schizotypy, and schizotypy was significantly correlated with velocity gain during standard trials in unmedicated and depression-free OCD patients. These findings highlight the role of schizotypy as a candidate endophenotype of OCD and add to the growing evidence for predisposing personality traits in OCD. Furthermore, intact gain may represent a key characteristic that distinguishes the OCD and schizophrenia patient populations.",

        "abstract": "Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) show deficient planning capacity in the Tower of London (TOL) problem solving task. Preliminary evidence for similar deficits in unaffected first-degree relatives suggests that impaired planning may constitute an endophenotype of OCD. However, results on this issue are inconsistent, possibly owing to small sample sizes and variability in problem structure across TOL tasks. Here, we adopted a computerized version of the TOL task featuring a 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 factorial design (high/low search depth\u202f\u00d7\u202ffull/partial tower goal state) and examined a well-characterized sample of n\u202f=\u202f72 OCD patients, n\u202f=\u202f76 unaffected first-degree relatives and n\u202f=\u202f102 healthy comparison subjects. Both OCD patients and relatives exhibited significantly less accurate problem solving than controls. Search depth, goal hierarchy, or the number of minimum moves did not moderate these group differences. Medication, OCD symptoms, and depressive comorbidity did not affect TOL performance in patients, suggesting a state-independent effect. In conclusion, we found that OCD patients as well as unaffected first-degree relatives show deficient TOL performance across a range of task conditions, strongly supporting the role of impaired planning as an endophenotype of OCD, and contributing to the growing evidence for fronto-striatal dysfunctions in OCD.",

Performance deficits in the antisaccade task would support this model, but results from previous small-scale studies have been inconclusive as either increased error rates, prolonged antisaccade latencies, both or neither have been reported in OCD patients. In order to address this issue, we investigated antisaccade performance in a large sample of OCD patients ( = 169) and matched control subjects ( = 183). As impaired antisaccade performance constitutes a potential endophenotype of OCD, unaffected first-degree relatives of OCD patients ( = 100) were assessed, as well. Furthermore, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis to integrate our data with previous findings. In the empirical study, OCD patients exhibited significantly increased antisaccade latencies, intra-subject variability (ISV) of antisaccade latencies, and antisaccade error rates. The latter effect was driven by errors with express latency (80-130 ms), as patients did not differ significantly from controls with regards to regular errors (>130 ms). Notably, unaffected relatives of OCD patients showed elevated antisaccade express error rates and increased ISV of antisaccade latencies, as well. Antisaccade performance was not associated with state anxiety within groups. Among relatives, however, we observed a significant correlation between antisaccade error rate and harm avoidance. Medication status of OCD patients, symptom severity, depressive comorbidity, comorbid anxiety disorders and OCD symptom dimensions did not significantly affect antisaccade performance. Meta-analysis of 10 previous and the present empirical study yielded a medium-sized effect ( = 0.48,  < 0.001) for higher error rates in OCD patients, while the effect for latencies did not reach significance owing to strong heterogeneity ( = 0.51,  = 0.069). Our results support the assumption of impaired antisaccade performance in OCD, although effects sizes were only moderately large. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that increased antisaccade express error rates and ISV of antisaccade latencies may constitute endophenotypes of OCD.

        "abstract": "Background   Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a severe psychiatric disorder, which aggregates in families. Its etiology is assumed to involve interactions between genetically determined vulnerability factors and critical environmental influences. In the present study, we aim to investigate how the personality trait harm avoidance and the experience of different childhood adversities contribute to the development of OCD.    Methods  One hundred and sixty-nine patients with OCD, 157 healthy comparison subjects and 57 unaffected first-degree relatives of OCD patients were examined by trained clinical psychologists using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SKID). Harm avoidance was assessed using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and the severity of childhood adversities was measured with the Childhood Adversity Questionnaire (CTQ). Associations with depressive and obsessive-compulsive symptoms were investigated using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R).    Results  Both OCD patients and unaffected relatives showed elevated levels of harm avoidance compared to healthy volunteers. Furthermore, patients exhibited significantly higher scores than relatives. This linear pattern was observed throughout all subscales of harm avoidance, and remained stable after controlling for the severity of depressive and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. With regards to childhood adversities, OCD patients reported higher levels than unaffected relatives and healthy volunteers, specifically on the subscales emotional abuse, emotional neglect, and experience of inconsistencies.    Discussion  The present findings support the role of harm avoidance as a potential endophenotype of OCD, and provide further evidence for a diathesis-stress model. While patients with OCD and unaffected first-degree relatives share elevated levels of harm avoidance, a heightened severity of childhood adversity was only observed in patients. A predisposition to exaggerated anxiety responses may thus take different trajectories depending on adverse environmental influences during childhood. In future research, we aim to investigate the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying these findings.",

        "abstract": "Extracorporeal life support is a promising concept for selected patients in refractory cardiogenic shock and for advanced life support of persistent ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest. Animal models of ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest could help to investigate new treatment strategies for successful resuscitation. Associated procedural pitfalls in establishing a rat model of extracorporeal life support resuscitation need to be replaced, refined, reduced, and reported.Anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats (350-600\u200ag) (n\u200a=\u200a126) underwent cardiac arrest induced with a pacing catheter placed into the right ventricle via a jugular cannula. Rats were resuscitated with extracorporeal life support, mechanical ventilation, defibrillation, and medication. Catheter and cannula explantation was performed if restoration of spontaneous circulation was achieved. All observed serious adverse events (SAEs) occurring in each of the experimental phases were analyzed.Restoration of spontaneous circulation could be achieved in 68 of 126 rats (54%); SAEs were observed in 76 (60%) experiments. Experimental procedures related SAEs were 62 (82%) and avoidable human errors were 14 (18%). The most common serious adverse events were caused by insertion or explantation of the venous bypass cannula and resulted in lethal bleeding, cannula dislocation, or air embolism.Establishing an extracorporeal life support model in rats has confronted us with technical challenges. Even advancements in small animal critical care management over the years delivered by an experienced team and technical modifications were not able to totally avoid such serious adverse events. Replacement, refinement, and reduction reports of serious adverse events demanding study exclusions to avoid animal resources are missing and are presented hereby.",

        "abstract": "The advantage of using non-invasive imaging such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) to asses material properties from deformed biofilm geometries can be compromised by the assumptions made on fluid forces acting on the biofilm. This study developed a method for the determination of elastic properties of biofilms by modelling the biofilm deformation recorded by OCT imaging with poroelastic fluid-structure interaction computations. Two-dimensional biofilm geometries were extracted from OCT scans of non-deformed and deformed structures as a result of hydrodynamic loading. The biofilm geometries were implemented in a model coupling fluid dynamics with elastic solid mechanics and Darcy flow in the biofilm. The simulation results were compared with real deformed geometries and a fitting procedure allowed estimation of the Young's modulus in given flow conditions. The present method considerably improves the estimation of elastic moduli of biofilms grown in mini-fluidic rectangular channels. This superior prediction is based on the relaxation of several simplifying assumptions made in past studies: shear stress is not anymore taken constant over the biofilm surface, total stress including also pressure is accounted for, any biofilm shape can be used in the determinations, and non-linear behavior of mechanical properties can be estimated. Biofilm elastic moduli between 70 and 700\u202fPa were obtained and biofilm hardening at large applied stress due to increasing flow velocity was quantified. The work performed here opens the way for in-situ determination of other mechanical properties (e.g., viscoelastic properties, relaxation times, plastic yields) and provides data for modelling biofilm deformation and detachment with eventual applications in biofilm control and removal strategies.",

In this study, the internal dripper geometry was recreated in 3-D printed microfluidic devices (MFDs). To mimic the temperature conditions in (semi-) arid areas, experiments were conducted in a temperature controlled box between 20 and 50\u00b0C. MFDs were either fed with two different treated wastewater (TWW) or synthetic wastewater. Biofilm formation was monitored non-invasively and in situ by optical coherence tomography (OCT). 3-D OCT datasets reveal the major fouling position and illustrate that biofilm development was influenced by fluid dynamics. Biofilm volumetric coverage of the labyrinth up to 60% did not reduce the discharge rate, whereas a further increase to 80% reduced the discharge rate by 50%. Moreover, the biofilm formation rate was significantly inhibited in daily temperature cycle independent of the cultivation medium used.",

The review aims to critically discuss the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) for the visualization of the biofilm structure as well as its dynamic behavior. A short overview on common and well-known, established imaging techniques for biofilms such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), Raman microscopy (RM), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) paves the way to imaging biofilms at the mesoscale, which is perfectly covered by means of OCT. Principle, resolution, imaging velocity, and limitations of OCT are subsequently presented and discussed in the context of biofilm applications. Examples are provided showing the strength of this technique with respect to the visualization of the mesoscopic biofilm structure as well as the estimation of flow profiles and shear rates. Common and new structural parameters derived from OCT datasets are presented. Additionally, the review shows the importance of OCT with respect to a better description of mechanical biofilm properties. Finally, the implementation of multi-dimensional OCT datasets in biofilm modelling is shown by several examples aiming on an improved understanding of mass transfer at the bulk-biofilm interface.

The presence of these particles might impose a negative impact on the mass transfer in biofilm systems when they attach to the bulk-biofilm interface. We thus investigated the impact of real wastewater particles by combining optical coherence tomography (OCT) and oxygen microsensor measurements. The deposition of wastewater particles of different size classes onto the biofilm surface was captured in 3D by means of OCT in a lab-scale flume. The thickness of the particle layer was calculated from OCT images. The influence of the particle deposition with respect to oxygen mass transfer into the biofilm was monitored by measuring oxygen profiles before and after particle deposition. By employing OCT, the formation of the particle layer on the biofilm surface was monitored  in situ  and non-invasively over time. Results from oxygen microsensor measurements concluded 20\u201370% reduction of the dissolved oxygen flux from the biofilm surface into the biofilm matrix. This decrease in oxygen availability lowered substrate conversion in biofilms exposed to high loadings of organic wastewater particles.",

TWW components such as bacteria and suspend minerals interact under different environmental conditions, forming aggregates varying in size and stability that may adversely affect water flow in drippers. Our aim in this study was to characterize aggregates\u2019 size and stability in suspensions of bacteria and clay particles, under different conditions prevailing in TWW. Flocculation value tests, thermal analysis, microscopy and particle size distribution were used to measure bacterial\u2013clays interaction in suspension. Our results showed suspension stability increase with an increase in bacterial population. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) produced by bacteria or added as fulvic acid was found to be the most important parameter involved in determining aggregate size and stability under similar environmental condition. The presence of these components most commonly resulted in higher stability of the suspension, mainly smaller particles in suspension. A novel measurement aimed to determine size and stability parameters for suspended particles has been established and was found to be useful in predicting suspended compound interactions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A reaction-diffusion biofilm model was implemented to simulate the nitrification/denitrification performance of a lab-scale integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) reactor. The model was capable of representing the system performance, i.e. changes in organic load and decrease in sludge age. Furthermore, nitrification batch tests with sludge and carrier material could also be simulated successfully with the model. Model simulation revealed that the diffusive fluxes into biofilm depended strongly on substrate loading as well as sludge age. The microbial composition in the biofilm matrix was mainly influenced by the diffusive flux of chemical oxygen demand (COD) into biofilm. When COD removal started to switch to biofilm, heterotrophic bacteria quickly replaced the previously dominating autotrophic bacteria. Running a set of simulations with a range of effective biofilm surface area and different mass transfer coefficients revealed the strong influence of these two parameters on the IFAS performance. The analysis showed that both parameters were dominating factors for ammonium removal. The optimum mass transfer coefficient was in the range of 3\u20134\u202fm\u202fd \u22121  and the effective biofilm surface was around 63\u201388% of the theoretical carrier surface.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Fouling formation in membrane distillation limits process stability and could cause besides wetting a rapid flux decrease making the process inefficient. Process performance is conventionally assessed by flux monitoring. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables in-situ visualization and quantification of fouling layers dominated by scaling in a fully operated direct contact membrane distillation system (DCMD). This study presents an innovative methodology for 3D dataset analysis allowing for the detection and quantification of predominant scaling on the membrane surface. Defined fouling parameters permit a correlation between process performance indicators, especially flux decrease and quantified fouling layer coverage. Additionally, structural information about the fouling layer was derived from the fouling parameters calculated from OCT C-scans across the feed channel within the flat sheet membrane unit. The method was successfully applied in DCMD of hot spring water, showing a critical fouling ratio between R S  =\u202f50\u201360\u202f\u00b5m 3 /\u00b5m 2 , resulting in an overall flux decrease of 80%. The consideration of covered membrane area in R C  proved the correlation of increasing fouling layer coverage (up to 90%) inducing a flux decline (by 80%) verifying the hypothesis, that the share of covered membrane area is the limiting step for MD performance. The presented method was able to link scalable fouling parameters with macroscopic process parameters. Hence making performance monitoring possible while enabling an adapted process control.",

Both light microscopy (2D) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were employed to track the biofilm development on carriers of different geometry and under different aeration rates. Biofilm structure was further characterized with respect to average biofilm thickness, biofilm growth velocity, biomass volume, compartment filling degree, surface area, etc. The results showed that carriers with a smaller compartment size stimulated a quick establishment of biofilms. Low aeration rates favored fast development of biofilms. Comparison between the results derived from 2D and 3D images revealed comparable results with respect to average biofilm thickness and compartment filling degree before the carrier compartments were fully willed with biomass. However, 3D imaging with OCT was capable of visualizing and quantifying the heterogeneous structure of biofilms, which cannot be achieved using 2D imaging.",

        "abstract": "Imaging and modeling are two major approaches in biofilm research to understand the physical and biochemical processes involved in biofilm development. However, they are often used separately. In this study we combined these two approaches to investigate substrate mass transfer and mass flux. Cross-sectional biofilm images were acquired by means of optical coherence tomography (OCT) for biofilms grown on carriers. A 2D biofilm model was developed incorporating OCT images as well as a simplified biofilm geometry serving as structural templates. The model incorporated fluid flow, substrate transfer and biochemical conversion of substrates and simulated the hydrodynamics surrounding the biofilm structure as well as the substrate distribution. The method allowed detailed analysis of the hydrodynamics and mass transfer characteristics at the micro-scale. Biofilm activity with respect to substrate fluxes was compared among different combinations of flow, substrate availability and biomass density. The combined approach revealed that higher substrate fluxes at heterogeneous biofilm surface under two conditions: pure diffusion and when high flow velocity along the biofilms surface renders the whole liquid-biofilm interface to be highly active. In-between the two conditions the substrate fluxes across the surface of smooth biofilm geometry were higher than that of the heterogeneous biofilms. This article is protected by copyright.

        "abstract": "This paper summarizes theoretical approaches and empirical research on the links between partnership and family dynamics on the one hand and spatial mobility and housing transitions on the other. Spatial mobility includes residential relocations and commuting. We consider three types of partnerships\u2014living apart together, unmarried and married co-residential unions\u2014and the transitions between them. We also consider separations and the death of a partner. Moreover, we pay attention to childbirth and its consequences for relocation decisions and housing. We differentiate spatial mobility according to distance and direction; housing transitions are considered mainly with respect to changes in ownership status and housing quality (e.g. size of the accommodation). In line with the adjustment perspective on spatial mobility, this paper demonstrates that spatial mobility is a means for individuals and households to adjust their housing situation and their place of residence to requirements of a changing household size and composition as well as to demands of the labor market. At the same time, spatial mobility seems to be more than a mere adjustment process of individuals or households: it is also a determinant of life course changes.",

        "abstract": "Fermi liquid theory provides a remarkably powerful framework for the description of the conduction electrons in metals and their ordering phenomena, such as superconductivity, ferromagnetism, and spin- and charge-density-wave order. A different class of ordering phenomena of great interest concerns spin configurations that are topologically protected, that is, their topology can be destroyed only by forcing the average magnetization locally to zero. Examples of such configurations are hedgehogs (points at which all spins are either pointing inwards or outwards) and vortices. A central question concerns the nature of the metallic state in the presence of such topologically distinct spin textures. Here we report a high-pressure study of the metallic state at the border of the skyrmion lattice in MnSi, which represents a new form of magnetic order composed of topologically non-trivial vortices. When long-range magnetic order is suppressed under pressure, the key characteristic of the skyrmion lattice--that is, the topological Hall signal due to the emergent magnetic flux associated with the topological winding--is unaffected in sign or magnitude and becomes an important characteristic of the metallic state. The regime of the topological Hall signal in temperature, pressure and magnetic field coincides thereby with the exceptionally extended regime of a pronounced non-Fermi-liquid resistivity. The observation of this topological Hall signal in the regime of the NFL resistivity suggests empirically that spin correlations with non-trivial topological character may drive a breakdown of Fermi liquid theory in pure metals.",

In the transition metal Heusler compound Fe2TiSn we observe evidence for incipient ferromagnetic quantum criticality. High pressure studies in MnSi reveal empirical evidence for a topological non-Fermi liquid state without quantum criticality. Single crystals of the hexagonal Laves phase compound Nb1\u2212y Fe2+y  provide evidence of a ferromagnetic to spin density wave transition as a function of slight compositional changes. Last but not least, neutron depolarisation imaging in CePd1\u2212x Rh x  underscore evidence taken from the bulk properties of the formation of a Kondo cluster glass.\n",

        "abstract": "Novel peptidic dual agonists of the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucagon receptor are reported to have enhanced efficacy over pure GLP-1 receptor agonists with regard to treatment of obesity and diabetes. We describe novel exendin-4 based dual agonists designed with an activity ratio favoring the GLP-1 versus the glucagon receptor. As result of an iterative optimization procedure that included molecular modeling, structural biological studies (X-ray, NMR), peptide design & synthesis, experimental activity and solubility profiling, a candidate molecule was identified. Novel SAR points are reported that allowed to fine-tune the desired receptor activity ratio and increased solubility in the presence of antimicrobial preservatives - findings which can be of general applicability for any peptide discovery project. The peptide was evaluated in chronic in vivo studies in obese diabetic monkeys as translational model for the human situation and demonstrated favorable blood glucose and body weight lowering effects.",

        "abstract": "We assessed the therapeutic contribution of the individual components of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and glucagon receptor (GCGR) agonists alone and in combination upon energy homeostasis and glycemic control in diet-induced obese, diabetic non-human primates.The pharmacological active dose ranges of selective agonists were established through a dose-finding study, followed by a six weeks chronic study. Repeated subcutaneous administration of a selective GCGR agonist (30\u00b5g/kg qd) did not affect food intake or body weight, whereas the selective GLP-1R agonist (3\u00b5g/kg qd) alone decreased energy intake by 18% and body weight by 3.8\u00b10.9%. Combination of both agonists reduced significantly cumulative food intake by 27% and body weight by 6.6\u00b10.9%.Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was improved by GLP-1R agonist (baseline vs. end of study: 176.7\u00b134.0 vs 115.9\u00b116.1mg/dl). In contrast, groups exposed to GCGR agonist experienced non-significant elevations of FPG. More accurate assessment of therapeutic interventions on glucose homeostasis was tested by an intravenous glucose-tolerance-test. Glucose excursion was significantly elevated by chronic GCGR agonist administration, whilst it was significantly decreased in GLP-1R agonist treated monkeys. In the combination group, a non-significant increase of glucose excursion was seen, concomitantly with significantly increased insulin secretion.We conclude that chronic glucagon agonism does not affect energy homeostasis in non-human primates. In combination with GLP-1R agonism, glucagon agonism synergistically enhances negative energy balance with resulting larger body weight loss. However, adding GCGR to GLP-1R agonism diminishes glycemic control in diabetic monkeys. Therefore, long-term therapeutic implications of using GLP-1R/GCGR co-agonists for weight management in diabetes warrants further scrutiny.",

Here, we report a series of novel peptides with dual activity on these receptors that were discovered by rational design. On the basis of sequence analysis and structure-based design, structural elements of glucagon were engineered into the selective GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4, resulting in hybrid peptides with potent dual GLP-1/glucagon receptor activity. Detailed structure-activity relationship data are shown. Further modifications with unnatural and modified amino acids resulted in novel metabolically stable peptides that demonstrated a significant dose-dependent decrease in blood glucose in chronic studies in diabetic db/db mice and reduced body weight in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Structural analysis by NMR spectroscopy confirmed that the peptides maintain an exendin-4-like structure with its characteristic tryptophan-cage fold motif that is responsible for favorable chemical and physical stability.",

This aspect is often disregarded and only evaluated late in discovery, imposing a high risk for delays in development, increased costs and finally for the project in general. Here, we report a case study of early physicochemical peptide characterization and optimization of dual glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) / glucagon receptor agonists towards specific formulation requirements. Aggregation issues which were observed at acidic pH in the presence of phenolic preservatives could be eliminated by modification of the peptide sequence, and chemical stability issues were significantly improved by addition of stabilizing formulation excipients. We describe structural, analytical and biophysical characterization in different compositions to analyze the effect of pH and formulation excipients on physical and chemical stability. Molecular models have been generated to rationalize peptide stability behavior based on computed physicochemical descriptors and interactions with excipients. To conclude these studies, a general roadmap is proposed how to assess and optimize early physicochemical peptide properties in a sophisticated way by combining experimental and in silico profiling to provide stable peptide drugs under relevant formulation conditions at the end of discovery.",

Here we report a new method for the mild and effective mono-iodination of tyrosine residues in fully unprotected peptides.

The introduced iodine can subsequently serve as a handle for further functionalization such as introduction of fluorescent dyes and thus be used for chemoselective labeling of isolated peptides.",

The self-assembly of these macromolecules in organic solvents results in the formation of micelles and vesicles, respectively, depending on the solvent used. To transfer the systems into water, cross-linking using glutaraldehyde was applied, followed by the consumption of excessive aldehyde functions by either diethylamine or 6-aminofluorescein (6AF). The cross-linked assemblies were analyzed regarding their size and shape by electron microscopy and light scattering methods, as well as for their chemical composition by solid state NMR spectroscopy. 6AF associated samples were examined with respect to their absorption and fluorescence behavior in aqueous environment, revealing an alkaline microenvironment within the presented nanostructures. The toxicity of the systems against mouse fibroblast cell line L929 was examined by the XTT assay and was found to be insignificant for concentrations of up to 2.5 mg mL. Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy analysis revealed an efficient concentration and time dependent cellular uptake of the nanogels.",

        "abstract": "Establishing the significance of observed effects is a preliminary requirement for any meaningful interpretation of clinical and experimental Electroencephalography or Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We propose a method to evaluate significance on the level of sensors whilst retaining full temporal or spectral resolution. Input data are multiple realizations of sensor data. In this context, multiple realizations may be the individual epochs obtained in an evoked-response experiment, or group study data, possibly averaged within subject and event type, or spontaneous events such as spikes of different types. In this contribution, we apply Statistical non-Parametric Mapping (SnPM) to MEG sensor data. SnPM is a non-parametric permutation or randomization test that is assumption-free regarding distributional properties of the underlying data. The method, referred to as Maps SnPM, is demonstrated using MEG data from an auditory mismatch negativity paradigm with one frequent and two rare stimuli and validated by comparison with Topographic Analysis of Variance (TANOVA). The result is a time- or frequency-resolved breakdown of sensors that show consistent activity within and/or differ significantly between event or spike types. TANOVA and Maps SnPM were applied to the individual epochs obtained in an evoked-response experiment. The TANOVA analysis established data plausibility and identified latencies-of-interest for further analysis. Maps SnPM, in addition to the above, identified sensors of significantly different activity between stimulus types.",

        "abstract": "Data from magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) suffer from a rather limited signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) due to cortical background activities and other artifacts. In order to study the effect of the SNR on the size and distribution of dipole clusters reconstructed from interictal epileptic spikes, we performed simulations using realistically shaped volume conductor models and extended cortical sources with different sensor configurations. Head models and cortical surfaces were derived from an averaged magnetic resonance image dataset (Montreal Neurological Institute). Extended sources were simulated by spherical patches with Gaussian current distributions on the folded cortical surface. Different patch sizes were used to investigate cancellation effects from opposing walls of sulcal foldings and to estimate corresponding changes in MEG and EEG sensitivity distributions. Finally, white noise was added to the simulated fields and equivalent current dipole reconstructions were performed to determine size and shape of the resulting dipole clusters. Neuronal currents are oriented perpendicular to the local cortical surface and show cancellation effects of source components on opposing sulcal walls. Since these mostly tangential aspects from large cortical patches cancel out, large extended sources exhibit more radial components in the head geometry. This effect has a larger impact on MEG data as compared to EEG, because in a spherical head model radial currents do not yield any magnetic field. Confidence volumes of single reconstructed dipoles from simulated data at different SNRs show a good correlation with the extension of clusters from repeated dipole reconstructions. Size and shape of dipole clusters reconstructed from extended cortical sources do not only depend on spike and timepoint selection, but also strongly on the SNR of the measured interictal MEG or EEG data. In a linear approximation the size of the clusters is proportional to the inverse SNR.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The optical performance of a concentrating solar power (CSP) collector is critical to the overall efficiency of the system. This study presents a detailed optical comparison between three representative CSP collector designs including linear Fresnel, parabolic trough, and central-receiver technologies. Optical models are implemented in SolTrace, which is ray-tracing software developed at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The ray-tracing algorithm is used to calculate a collector\u2019s design-point performance as well as its incidence-angle modifiers to evaluate the collector performance at any sun position during a typical meteorological year. The efficiency over a one-year period is then analyzed based on ray-tracing results. Using China Lake (California) as an example, the annual optical efficiency is 60% for the selected parabolic trough collector, 52% for the selected central-receiver technology, and 40% for the selected linear Fresnel collector. The parabolic trough has the highest optical performance among all. The selected central-receiver technology provides the most consistent seasonal production profile over the course of the year due to its two-axis-tracking ability but would suffer most from the increasing solar collector optical error. It is also shown that a dramatic cost reduction is required for the selected linear Fresnel technology to be competitive in the future energy market. Sensitivity of three CSP technologies to the deployment locations and the overall optical-error magnitude is also examined through annual performance analysis. The results will provide insights into a better understanding on inherent technical aspects of different CSP technologies.",

        "abstract": "Decades of cardiovascular research have shown that variable and flexible levels of protein phosphorylation are necessary to maintain cardiac function. A delicate balance between phosphorylated and dephosphorylated states of proteins is guaranteed by a complex interplay of protein kinases (PKs) and phosphatases. Serine/threonine phosphatases, in particular members of the protein phosphatase (PP) family govern dephosphorylation of the majority of these cardiac proteins. Recent findings have however shown that PPs do not only dephosphorylate previously phosphorylated proteins as a passive control mechanism but are capable to actively control PK activity via different direct and indirect signaling pathways. These control mechanisms can take place on (epi-)genetic, (post-)transcriptional, and (post-)translational levels. In addition PPs themselves are targets of a plethora of proteinaceous interaction partner regulating their endogenous activity, thus adding another level of complexity and feedback control toward this system. Finally, novel approaches are underway to achieve spatiotemporal pharmacologic control of PPs which in turn can be used to fine-tune misleaded PK activity in heart disease. Taken together, this review comprehensively summarizes the major aspects of PP-mediated PK regulation and discusses the subsequent consequences of deregulated PP activity for cardiovascular diseases in depth.",

While a few bacteria transport electrons over micrometer distances to their surroundings, filaments of cable bacteria are hypothesized to conduct electric currents over centimeter distances. We used resonance Raman microscopy to analyze cytochrome redox states in living cable bacteria. Cable-bacteria filaments were placed in microscope chambers with sulfide as electron source and oxygen as electron sink at opposite ends. Along individual filaments a gradient in cytochrome redox potential was detected, which immediately broke down upon removal of oxygen or laser cutting of the filaments. Without access to oxygen, a rapid shift toward more reduced cytochromes was observed, as electrons were no longer drained from the filament but accumulated in the cellular cytochromes. These results provide direct evidence for long-distance electron transport in living multicellular bacteria.",

        "title": "Rapid data processing for ultrafast X-ray computed tomography using scalable and modular CUDA based pipelines.",
        "abstract": "Abstract   Ultrafast X-ray tomography is an advanced imaging technique for the study of dynamic processes basing on the principles of electron beam scanning. A typical application case for this technique is e.g. the study of multiphase flows, that is, flows of mixtures of substances such as gas\u2013liquidflows in pipelines or chemical reactors. At Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) a number of such tomography scanners are operated. Currently, there are two main points limiting their application in some fields. First, after each CT scan sequence the data of the radiation detector must be downloaded from the scanner to a data processing machine. Second, the current data processing is comparably time-consuming compared to the CT scan sequence interval. To enable online observations or use this technique to control actuators in real-time, a modular and scalable data processing tool has been developed, consisting of user-definable stages working independently together in a so called data processing pipeline, that keeps up with the CT scanner\u2019s maximal frame rate of up to 8 \u00a0kHz. The newly developed data processing stages are freely programmable and combinable. In order to achieve the highest processing performance all relevant data processing steps, which are required for a standard slice image reconstruction, were individually implemented in separate stages using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA programming language. Data processing performance tests on different high-end GPUs (Tesla K20c, GeForce GTX 1080, Tesla P100) showed excellent performance.    Program summary/new version program summary   Program Title:  GLADOS/RISA   Program Files doi:  http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/65sx747rvm.1    Licensing provisions:  LGPLv3   Programming language:  C++/CUDA   Supplementary material:  Test data set, used for the performance analysis.   Nature of problem:  Ultrafast computed tomography is performed with a scan rate of up to 8\u00a0kHz. To obtain cross-sectional images from projection data computer-based image reconstruction algorithms must be applied. The objective of the presented program is to reconstruct a data stream of around 1.3 \u00a0GB \u00a0s \u22121  in a minimum time period. Thus, the program allows to go into new fields of application and to use in the future even more compute-intensive algorithms, especially for data post-processing, to improve the quality of data analysis.   Solution method:  The program solves the given problem using a two-step process: first, by a generic, expandable and widely applicable template library implementing the streaming paradigm (GLADOS); second, by optimized processing stages for ultrafast computed tomography implementing the required algorithms in a performance-oriented way using CUDA (RISA). Thereby, task-parallelism between the processing stages as well as data parallelism within one processing stage is realized.",

The CT scanner delivers cross-sectional material distributions by contactless measurements with a spatial resolution of approximately 1\u00a0mm and a temporal resolution of maximal 8\u00a0kHz. Currently, two central time-consuming processes have been identified limiting the efficient usage of that worldwide unique CT technique: a) the data transfer from the detector system to central data storages (e.g. computer or data base) and b) the data processing. Thus, data pre-processing and data reconstruction algorithms have been adapted for the use at multi-core central processing units (CPUs) and even many-core graphics processing units (GPUs). For optimal data processing results an advanced performance PC with two parallel operated high performance graphics processing units, a six-core processor, a high internal data bus speed and a large memory block has been assembled. The newly developed data processing algorithms induce a performance improvement of approximately 137 for the entire data processing sequence compared to the previous universally applicable single core CPU based data processing tool.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The dynamic bias error is a well-known effect in transmission radiometry. It appears when an object distribution, e.g. a multiphase flow, changes its constitution during the scanning process and reconstructed data, e.g. a cross-sectional image, is assumed to represent a time-average of the object distribution. In gamma-ray tomography long sampling intervals are necessary in order to obtain sufficient photon count statistics. Therefore, the measured photon count projection data is inherently time-averaged. The attenuation law gives a non-linear relation between attenuation and photon counts. Therefore, the calculation of the time-averaged attenuation from the time-averaged projection data may lead to non-negligible and systematic errors, commonly an underestimation of the real attenuation, which e.g. means an overestimation of the gas holdup in tomography images of two-phase flows.  In this work the application of a recently presented dynamic bias error correction method on time-averaged gamma-ray tomography is demonstrated. As an exemplary object we scanned a mock-up of a centrifugal pump. The suitability of this method was investigated for a generic highly turbulent two-phase flow scenario with both a virtual tomography data set as well as real measured data. These investigations allowed the quantification of both the tomography image artefacts caused by the dynamic bias error and the grade of potential correction by the presented method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this contribution we report on spatially resolved analysis of multiphase hydrodynamics in solid foam packed trickle bed reactors. For the investigation we used ultrafast X-ray computed tomography and fast response pressure transducers. The SiSiC foams\u2019 pore density, the liquid distribution system as well as gas and liquid flow rates were varied. The transient behavior of the liquid holdup at trickle and pulse flow as well as after drainage were examined and correlations for static and dynamic holdups were derived. The correlations are based on Eotvos, Reynolds and Galileo number, using porosity and specific area for the definition of the hydraulic diameter. The correlations are applicable to a wide range of foam morphologies, pore densities and operating conditions reported in the literature. The axial pressure gradients in the solid foams showed significantly lower pressure drop compared to particle packings of similar specific surface area. The evolution of liquid spreading was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively with various irrigation patterns. In addition, an approach for the determination of radial liquid dispersion coefficients in solid foams is presented.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Up to 80 %  of the total energy budget of wastewater treatment plants is consumed by the activated sludge process. Current optimizations are mostly based on limited instrumentation for single points of measurement which cannot express the complex hydrodynamic and biochemical processes. Therefore, the ultrafast electron beam X-ray tomography system ROFEX of HZDR is used as a new measurement technique to capture the temporal evolution of the multiphase flow in the opaque active sludge. A detailed study has been carried out in a vertical column of 3.5\u00a0m height at HZDR to obtain an improved understanding of the hydrodynamics of aerated sludge and an evaluation of different aerators. The target parameters are bubble size distribution, equivalent Sauter mean diameter of the bubbles, bubble rise velocity and local gas hold-up under the variation of sparger type (rubber, monolithic material), gas flow rate, rheology of the fluid (deionized water, salty water, sludge) and height in the liquid column. Therefore, in-house developed advanced image analysis algorithms were applied to the reconstructed tomographic images, which are also presented in the paper. The experiments showed that with ROFEX reliable measurement data of opaque multiphase flows is produced and is expected to be used in further investigations for the validation of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. The different sparger types showed comparable hydrodynamic performance.",

        "title": "Field Evaluation of Irrigation Scheduling Strategies using a Mechanistic Crop Growth Model",
        "abstract": "In a field experiment with white cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata (L.) alef.) in Germany, three irrigation scheduling approaches were tested: (i) three sprinkler irrigation schedules based on soil water balance calculations using different development-dependent crop coefficients; (ii) automatic drip irrigation based on soil water tension thresholds; (iii) irrigation scheduling by real-time application of a partially calibrated mechanistic crop growth model. Multi-objective calibration was applied to derive a fully calibrated model as a diagnostic tool to identify the water loss terms of the individual irrigation strategies.The results of the experiment showed that: (i) high yields can be achieved with relatively low amounts of irrigation water (~100\u2009mm), provided the optimal irrigation strategy and technique are applied; (ii) automated tension threshold-based drip irrigation outperformed soil water balance or crop growth model-based strategies; (iii) the soil water balance calculation approach relying on recommended Kc factors led to an enormous overirrigation; (iv) the application of a partially calibrated crop growth model led to an underestimation of the crop water requirements in conjunction with an incorrect timing of irrigation events and therefore resulted in the lowest yields. The diagnostic model identified percolation, for the wet sprinkler irrigation treatments, and canopy evaporation, for the dry and model-based treatments, as major water loss sources; only minimal additional water was lost in the tension-controlled treatment.

        "abstract": "Dielectronic recombination (DR) of Ar15+(1s\n22s) ions was studied in a single-pass merged-beams experiment at the UNILAC (universal linear accelerator) of GSI. Absolute recombination rates and cross sections were measured for electron-ion center-of-mass energies from 0 to 580 eV. A number of Rydberg states formed by DR with 2s \u2192 2p (\u0394n=0) and 2s \u2192 3l (\u0394n=1) core excitations and even individual terms in the 1s\n23l3l\u2032 configuration could be resolved. Theoretical calculations of DR cross sections are in good overall agreement with the data. In the calculations for \u0394n=0 transitions, effects of electric fields have to be included to reproduce the magnitude of the measured DR rates at the limit of the 2\n                  p\n                \n1/2l and 2\n                  p\n                \n3/2l Rydberg series. Discrepancies between theory and experiment are observed at the series limits of the (1s\n23lnl\u2032) Rydberg series.",

LARS II (Lokalautoadaptiver Sensor) with 368 \u00d7 256 Pixels splits the illumination information into two signals, thereby providing a dynamic range of more than 120 dB, as required by automotive applications. Both prototypes include Correlated Double Sampling (CDS) and Double Delta Sampling (DDS) for efficient suppression of fixed pattern noise.",

        "abstract": "An estimated 350 million people worldwide are affected by depression. Using affective sensing technology, our  long-term goal  is to develop an objective multimodal system that augments clinical opinion during the diagnosis and monitoring of clinical depression. This paper steps towards developing a classification system-oriented approach, where feature selection, classification and fusion-based experiments are conducted to infer which types of behaviour (verbal and nonverbal) and behaviour combinations can best discriminate between depression and non-depression. Using statistical features extracted from speaking behaviour, eye activity, and head pose, we characterise the behaviour associated with major depression and examine the performance of the classification of individual modalities and when fused. Using a real-world, clinically validated dataset of 30 severely depressed patients and 30 healthy control subjects, a Support Vector Machine is used for classification with several feature selection techniques. Given the statistical nature of the extracted features, feature selection based on T-tests performed better than other methods. Individual modality classification results were considerably higher than chance level (83 percent for speech, 73 percent for eye, and 63 percent for head). Fusing all modalities shows a remarkable improvement compared to unimodal systems, which demonstrates the complementary nature of the modalities. Among the different fusion approaches used here, feature fusion performed best with up to 88 percent average accuracy. We believe that is due to the compatible nature of the extracted statistical features.",

        "abstract": "Robots can be used when performing non-invasive surgical operations. They are operated by surgeons using remote controllers (e.g., control sticks; buttons). However, these controllers cannot convey the haptic feedback (touch) as with direct manipulation by one's hands. We tested whether peripheral visual feedback in the form of a flickering ring in the circumference of the control screen can to some extent substitute for haptic feedback. Participants had to lead a stylus pen in a predefined track while maintaining certain height from the stylus surface. In the experimental trials, changes in height were coupled with changes in the frequency of flickering of the ring. Results showed that participants who received the visual feedback performed the task better than participants without such feedback. It appears then that frequency can be transformed to other modalities like distance and may possibly be used to guide surgeons when using robots for medical procedures.",

An unobtrusive measure of stress in aviation might be the grip force pilots exert on the control stick that could increase due to the intensified muscle tonus that characterizes psychological stress.Method: Participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control group and performed tracking tasks. Participants in the experimental group were told that as of the second half of the experiment their compensation for the experiment would partly depend on their performance. No such conditioning existed for the control group. Grip force was then measured using a sensor on the control stick.Results: Grip force significantly increased in the second half of the experiment in the experimental gr...",

        "abstract": "User-centered design questions in gaze interfaces have been explored in multitude empirical investigations. Interestingly, the question of what eye should be the input device has never been studied. We compared tracking accuracy between the \u201ccyclopean\u201d (i.e., midpoint between eyes) dominant and non-dominant eye. In two experiments, participants performed tracking tasks. In Experiment 1, participants did not use a crosshair. Results showed that mean distance from target was smaller with cyclopean than with dominant or non-dominant eyes. In Experiment 2 participants controlled a crosshair with their cyclopean, dominant and non-dominant eye intermittently and had to align the crosshair with the target. Overall tracking accuracy was highest with cyclopean eye, yet similar between cyclopean and dominant eye in the second half of the experiment. From a theoretical viewpoint, our findings correspond with the cyclopean eye theory of egocentric direction and lend support to the hemispheric laterality approach of eye dominance. From a practical viewpoint, we show that what eye to use as input should be a design consideration in gaze interfaces.",

The current study aimed to validate the findings of Lupu, Elbaum, Wagner, and Braw in which RT variability was assessed, for the first time, in the WMT. A secondary aim was to suggest directions for the future research of RT measures in Forced-Choice Recognition Memory Performance Validity Tests (FCRM-PVTs). The study utilized a simulation research design, with participants performing the WMT's immediate recognition (IR) subtest (N\u2009=\u200959). Mean RTs and a scale which combines accuracy and RT measures, but not variability in RTs, possessed adequate discrimination capacity. Enhanced discrimination capacity was found after discarding the first items' RTs, though the IR-subtest's accuracy measure still showed superiority as a stand-alone validity indicator. The promise of RT measures may, therefore, lie in their ability to illuminate speed-accuracy tradeoffs among examinees with border-zone accuracy scores in FCRM-PVTs. They should, therefore, be regarded as complementary to conventional accuracy measures.",

Participants performed the MOXO-d-CPT and an established performance validity test (PVT). Second, the MOXO-d-CPT classification accuracy, employed in Phase 1, was retrospectively compared with archival data of 47 ADHD patients and age-matched healthy controls. : Simulators performed significantly worse on all MOXO-d-CPT indices than healthy controls and ADHD patients. Three MOXO-d-CPT indices (attention, hyperactivity, impulsivity) and a scale combining these indices showed adequate discriminative capacity. : The MOXO-d-CPT showed promise for the detection of feigned ADHD and, pending replication, can be employed for this aim in clinical practice and ADHD research.",

Therefore, we integrated an eye-tracker with the Word Memory Test (WMT) and tested its usefulness for the detection of feigned cognitive impairment. As part of the study, simulators (n\u2009=\u200944) and honest controls (n\u2009=\u200941) performed WMT's immediate-recognition (IR) subtest while their eye movements were recorded. In comparison to the control group, simulators spent less time gazing at relevant stimuli, spent more time gazing at irrelevant stimuli, and had a lower saccade rate. Group classification using a scale that combined the eye movement measures and the WMT's accuracy measure showed tentative promise (i.e., it enhanced classification compared to the use of the accuracy measure as the sole predictor of group membership). Overall, integration of an eye-tracker with the WMT was found to be feasible and the eye movement measures showed initial promise for the detection of feigned cognitive impairment. Moreover, eye movement measures proved useful in enhancing our understanding of strategies utilized by the simulators and the cognitive processes that affect their behavior. While the findings are clearly preliminary, we hope that they will encourage further research of these promising psychophysiological measures.",

        "abstract": "Inhibitor-1 (I-1) modulates protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) activity and thereby counteracts the phosphorylation by kinases. I-1 is downregulated and deactivated in failing hearts, but whether its role is beneficial or detrimental remains controversial, and opposing therapeutic strategies have been proposed. Overactivity of Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) with hyperphosphorylation of ryanodine receptors (RyR2) at the CaMKII-site is recognized to be central for heart failure and arrhythmias. Using an I-1-deficient mouse line as well as transfected cell lines, we investigated the effects of acute and chronic modulation of I-1 on CaMKII activity and RyR2 phosphorylation. We demonstrate that I-1 acutely modulates CaMKII by regulating PP1 activity. However, while ablation of I-1 should thus limit CaMKII-activation, we unexpectedly found exaggerated CaMKII-activation under \u03b2-adrenergic stress upon chronic loss of I-1 in knockout mice. We unraveled that this is due to chronic upregulation of the exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC) leading to augmented CaMKII activation, and using computational modeling validated that an increase in EPAC expression can indeed explain our experimental findings. Interestingly, at the level of RyR2, the increase in PP1 activity more than outweighed the increase in CaMKII activity, resulting in reduced RyR phosphorylation at Ser-2814. Exaggerated CaMKII activation due to counterregulatory mechanisms upon loss of I-1 is an important caveat with respect to suggested therapeutic I-1-inhibition, as CaMKII overactivity has been heavily implicated in several cardiac pathologies.",

        "title": "CaMKII does not control mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake in cardiac myocytes.",
        "abstract": "Mitochondria are the main source of ATP and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cardiac myocytes. Furthermore, activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) induces programmed cell death. These processes are essentially controlled by Ca , which is taken up into mitochondria via the Ca uniporter (MCU). It was recently proposed that Ca /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) regulates Ca uptake by interacting with the MCU, thereby affecting mPTP activation and programmed cell death. Here, we addressed the role of CaMKII under physiological conditions in which mitochondrial Ca uptake matches energy supply to demand of cardiac myocytes. To this end, we measured mitochondrial Ca uptake in isolated mitochondria and cardiac myocytes harvested from cardiomyocyte-specific CaMKII \u03b4 and \u03b3 double KO (CaMKII\u03b4/\u03b3 DKO) and global CaMKII\u03b4 KO mice. To simulate a physiological workload increase, cardiac myocytes were subjected to \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation (by isoproterenol superfusion) and increase in stimulation frequency (from 0.5 to 5\u00a0Hz). No differences in mitochondrial Ca accumulation were detected in isolated mitochondria or cardiac myocytes from both CaMKII KO models compared with wild-type (WT) littermates. Mitochondrial redox state and ROS production were unchanged in CaMKII\u03b4/\u03b3 DKO, whereas we observed a mild oxidation of mitochondrial redox state and an increase in H O emission from CaMKII\u03b4 KO cardiac myocytes exposed to an increase in workload. In conclusion, our results argue against a relevant regulation of mitochondrial Ca uptake via the MCU or mPTP activation by CaMKII in cardiac myocytes under physiological conditions.

However, many cardiac effects of atropine cannot be adequately explained solely by its antagonism at muscarinic receptors. In isolated mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes expressing a F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based cAMP biosensor, we confirmed that atropine inhibited acetylcholine-induced decreases in cAMP. Unexpectedly, even in the absence of acetylcholine, after G-protein inactivation with pertussis toxin or in myocytes from M- or M-muscarinic receptor knockout mice, atropine increased cAMP levels that were pre-elevated with the \u03b2-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. Using the FRET approach and in vitro phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity assays, we show that atropine acts as an allosteric PDE type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor. In human atrial myocardium and in both intact wildtype and M or M-receptor knockout mouse Langendorff hearts, atropine led to increased contractility and heart rates, respectively. In vivo, the atropine-dependent prolongation of heart rate increase was blunted in PDE4D but not in wildtype or PDE4B knockout mice. We propose that inhibition of PDE4 by atropine accounts, at least in part, for the induction of tachycardia and the arrhythmogenic potency of this drug.",

The regenerative processes after MI involve inflammatory, proliferative and maturation phases that are crucial for wound healing and reparation (3). However, an overactive inflammatory and fibrotic response is associated with maladaptive structural and electrophysiological remodeling, leading to systolic as well as diastolic dysfunction and contributing to the development of an arrhythmogenic substrate (2,4). Moreover, elevated cytokine levels also correlate with increased risk for recurrent coronary events in patients with MI (5).",

        "abstract": "Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (NS) is the most common glomerular disorder of childhood. Response to initial treatment with corticosteroids is an indicator of prognosis, as resistant patients often present more progressive disease. In this cross-sectional pilot study, we set out to discover a panel of noninvasive biomarkers that could distinguish steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) from steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS). Information gleaned from such a panel could yield more individualized treatment plans and prevent unnecessary steroid exposure in patients unlikely to respond. Urine was collected from 50 pediatric patients diagnosed with idiopathic NS at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) was used to discover 13 proteins that were differentially expressed in SSNS vs SRNS in a small 5 \u00d7 5 discovery cohort. Suitable assays were found for 9 of the 13 markers identified by iTRAQ and were used in a 25 SRNS \u00d7 25 SSNS validation cohort. Vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP), alpha-1 acid glycoprotein 1 (AGP1), alpha-1 acid glycoprotein 2 (AGP2), alpha-1-B glycoprotein (A1BG), fetuin-A, prealbumin, thyroxine-binding globulin and hemopexin, and alpha-2 macroglobulin were measured and combined with urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), which had been previously shown to distinguish patients with SRNS. Urinary VDBP, prealbumin, NGAL, fetuin-A, and AGP2 were found to be significantly elevated in SRNS using univariate analysis, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) ranging from 0.65 to 0.81. Multivariate analysis revealed a panel of all 10 markers that yielded an AUC of 0.92 for identification of SRNS. A subset of 5 markers (including VDBP, NGAL, fetuin-A, prealbumin, and AGP2) showed significant associations with SRNS and yielded an AUC of 0.85.",

        "abstract": "Background  Non-invasive biomarkers of lupus nephritis (LN) damage are needed to guide treatment decisions. Urinary proteomics has advanced as a tool for novel biomarker discovery in recent years. Specifically, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) is an advanced proteomics technique that quantifies and compares protein expression among samples by mass spectrometry in a single experiment. We used an unbiased proteomics approach to identify candidate urine biomarkers (CUBMs) predictive of LN chronicity and further pursued their validation in a larger cohort.  Methods  In this cross-sectional pilot study, we selected urine collected at kidney biopsy from 20 children with varying levels of LN damage (discovery cohort) and performed proteomic analysis using iTRAQ. We identified differentially excreted proteins based on degree of LN chronicity and sought to distinguish markers exhibiting different relative expression patterns using hierarchically-clustered log10-normalized relative abundance data with linked and distinct functions by biological network analyses. For each CUBM, we performed specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) on urine from a validation cohort (n=41) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to detect differences between LN chronicity, with LN activity adjustment. We evaluated for CUBM expression in LN biopsies with immunohistochemistry.  Results  iTRAQ detected 112 proteins from urine samples in the discovery cohort, 51 of which were quantifiable in all replicates. Simple ANOVA revealed four differentially expressed, chronicity-correlated proteins (p-values  Conclusions  Using advanced proteomic techniques followed by confirmation using specific ELISAs, we identified SERPINA3, a known inhibitor of neutrophil cathepsin G and angiotensin II production, as a potential urine biomarker to help quantify LN damage. SERPINA3 expression may be a protective mechanism from further kidney damage. Further validation of SERPINA3 as an LN damage biomarker in an independent cohort is needed to determine its ability to guide treatment and predict prognosis.

        "abstract": "Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR) controls myeloid progenitor proliferation and differentiation to neutrophils. Mutations in CSF3R (encoding G-CSFR) have been reported in patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, despite years of research, the malignant downstream signaling of the mutated G-CSFRs is not well understood. Here, we used a quantitative phospho-tyrosine analysis to generate a comprehensive signaling map of G-CSF induced tyrosine phosphorylation in the normal versus mutated (proximal: T618I and truncated: Q741x) G-CSFRs. Unbiased clustering and kinase enrichment analysis identified rapid induction of phospho-proteins associated with endocytosis by the wild type G-CSFR only; while G-CSFR mutants showed abnormal kinetics of canonical Stat3, Stat5, and Mapk phosphorylation, and aberrant activation of Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (Btk). Mutant-G-CSFR-expressing cells displayed enhanced sensitivity (3-5-fold lower IC50) for ibrutinib-based chemical inhibition of Btk. Primary murine progenitor cells from G-CSFR-Q741x knock-in mice validated activation of Btk by the mutant receptor and retrovirally transduced human CD34 umbilical cord blood cells expressing mutant receptors displayed enhanced sensitivity to Ibrutinib. A significantly lower clonogenic potential was displayed by both murine and human primary cells expressing mutated receptors upon ibrutinib treatment. Finally, a dramatic synergy was observed between ibrutinib and ruxolinitib at lower dose of the individual drug. Altogether, these data demonstrate the strength of unsupervised proteomics analyses in dissecting oncogenic pathways, and suggest repositioning Ibrutinib for therapy of myeloid leukemia bearing CSF3R mutations. Phospho-tyrosine data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD009662.",

Mutated G-CSFRs have been directly associated with two distinct malignant phenotypes in patients, e.g. acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL). However, the signaling mechanism of the mutated G-CSFRs is not well understood. Here, we present a comprehensive SILAC-based quantitative phosphoserine and phosphothreonine dataset of the normal and mutated G-CSFRs signaling using the BaF3 cell-line-based in vitro model system. High pH reversed phase concatenation and Titanium Dioxide Spin Tip column were utilized to increase the dynamic range and detection of the phosphoproteome of G-CSFRs. The dataset was further analyzed using several computational tools to validate the quality of the dataset. Overall, this dataset is the first global phosphoproteomics analysis of both normal and disease-associated-mutant G-CSFRs. We anticipate that this dataset will have a strong potential to decipher the phospho-signaling differences between the normal and malignant G-CSFR biology with therapeutic implications. The phosphoproteomic dataset is available via the PRIDE partner repository.",

Social information foraging theory quantitatively predicts the effect of diversity of hints on productivity. In this paper, we explore how to best leverage this theoretical prediction to support software change tasks. Specifically, we analyze the data from an observational study involving 20 bioinformatics researchers using SNI to solve software change tasks. We further classify the SNI support by using 5 diversity categories: social network type (e.g., wiki, Q&A, etc.), contributor role (e.g., core, marginal, etc.), number of contributors, information needs concerning software architecture, and information needs organized by complexity. Our results show that the contributor role best manifests the hint diversity, and its incorporation with architectural considerations could further improve productivity. Our research offers principled guidelines for supporting better use of SNI in end-user programming.",

The search engine is of significant help since it ranks the webpage links according to relevance. However, the time cost of foraging a webpage also affects if and how soon a developer can obtain a satisfying answer. In this paper, we use operationalizable constructs from Information Foraging Theory to identify two features: information accumulation and information amount for a webpage, which we hypothesize could assist developers in selecting appropriate webpages. We then invited 20 participants to perform a lab experiment of two software change tasks. The results supported our hypothesis by two findings. When having the tool support, the participants used less task completion time, and tended to visit more easy-to-forage webpages.",

Understanding the lineage and differentiation state of each cell is fundamentally important for the ultimate delineation of organ formation and function. We developed SLICE, a novel algorithm that utilizes single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to quantitatively measure cellular differentiation states based on single cell entropy and predict cell differentiation lineages via the construction of entropy directed cell trajectories. We validated our approach using three independent data sets with known lineage and developmental time information from both Homo sapiens and Mus musculus. SLICE successfully measured the differentiation states of single cells and reconstructed cell differentiation trajectories that have been previously experimentally validated. We then applied SLICE to scRNA-seq of embryonic mouse lung at E16.5 to identify lung mesenchymal cell lineage relationships that currently remain poorly defined. A two-branched differentiation pathway of five fibroblastic subtypes was predicted using SLICE. The present study demonstrated the general applicability and high predictive accuracy of SLICE in determining cellular differentiation states and reconstructing cell differentiation lineages in scRNA-seq analysis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Python is progressively consolidating itself within the HPC community with its simple syntax, large standard library, and powerful third-party libraries for scientific computing that are especially attractive to domain scientists. Despite Python lowering the bar for accessing parallel computing, utilizing the capacities of HPC systems efficiently remains a challenging task, after all. Yet, at the moment only few supporting tools exist and provide merely basic information in the form of summarized profile data. In this paper, we present our efforts in developing event-based tracing support for Python within the performance monitor Extrae to provide detailed information and enable a profound performance analysis. We present concepts to record the complete communication behavior as well as to capture entry and exit of functions in Python to provide the according application context. We evaluate our implementation in Extrae by analyzing the well-established electronic structure simulation package GPAW and demonstrate that the recorded traces provide equivalent information as for traditional C or Fortran applications and, therefore, offering the same profound analysis capabilities now for Python, as well.",

        "title": "Monitoring Heterogeneous Applications with the OpenMP Tools Interface",
        "abstract": "Heterogeneous systems are gaining more importance in supercomputing, yet they are challenging to program and developers require support tools to understand how well their accelerated codes perform and how they can be improved. The OpenMP Tools Interface (OMPT) is a new performance monitoring interface that is being considered for integration into the OpenMP standard. OMPT allows monitoring the execution of heterogeneous OpenMP applications by revealing the activity of the runtime through a standardized API as well as facilitating the exchange of performance information between devices with accelerated codes, and the analysis tool. In this paper we describe our efforts implementing parts of the OMPT specification necessary to monitor accelerators. In particular, the integration of the OMPT features to our parallel runtime system and instrumentation framework helps to obtain detailed performance information about the execution of the accelerated tasks issued to the devices to allow an insightful analysis. As a result of this analysis, the parallel runtime of the programming model has been improved. We focus on the evaluation of monitoring FPGA devices studying the performance of a common kernel in scientific algorithms: matrix multiplication. Nonetheless, this development is as well applicable to monitor GPU accelerators and Intel\u00ae; Xeon PhiTM co-processors operating under the OmpSs programming model.",

        "abstract": "Performance analysis tools are essential to help developers improve the performance of their parallel applications. These tools have widely embraced graphical representations to ease the analyst experience. However, they might mislead the analysis if using questionable aggregation techniques, especially when dealing with much data in timelines. In this paper, we have put efforts to demonstrate the value of information theory topics when applied to performance analysis. To this end, we extend a previously designed tool named folding which focuses on a detailed exploration of computation phases using trace files containing instrumented and sampled information. We design appropriate representations for the folding output by adopting an innovative aggregation technique based on information theory. As we will demonstrate through the paper, the original implementation of this tool may hinder the analysis by the introduction of some artifacts as a result of the chosen aggregation techniques. Additionally, we extend the folding tool to provide a decent analysis overview to start the analysis. Last, but not least, we successfully apply the new flow to two in-production HPC applications and characterize their performance behavior.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we address the problem of massive event trace sizes, one of the most urgent challenges in the performance analysis of large-scale parallel applications. Reducing trace sizes during the application runtime decreases application slow down, eliminates measurement bias, and cuts down stress on the underlying file system. Previous approaches use static filters to decrease trace size, which relies on preceding knowledge about the application or, otherwise, delivers poor results. In contrast, we propose runtime filters that automatically adapt to an application's runtime behavior and, therefore, do not require any prior knowledge. We present and compare four adaptive runtime filters: for regions that are leaf nodes in the call tree, for regions with similar duration, for activities within iterations, and for blocks of activities with repetitive behavior. We evaluate a prototype implementation of these filters based on the stateof-the-art trace collector Score-P and the Open Trace Format 2 trace library with five real-life applications and achieved a trace size reduction of up to two orders of magnitude and an additional overhead of less than one percent in average.",

        "abstract": "Use of [18F]FDG-PET in clinical breast cancer (BC) imaging is limited mainly due to insufficient expression levels of GLUT1 in up to 50% of all patients. Fructose-specific facilitative hexose transporter GLUT5 represents an alternative biomarker for PET imaging of hexose metabolism in BC. The goal of the present study was to compare uptake characteristics of selected hexose-based PET radiotracers in murine BC model EMT6. Uptake of 1-deoxy-1-[18F]fluoro-D-fructose (1-[18F]FDF), 6-deoxy-6-[18F]fluoro-D-fructose (6-[18F]FDF), 1-deoxy-1-[18F]fluoro-2,5-anhydro-mannitol (1-[18F]FDAM), 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (2-[18F]FDG) and 6-deoxy-6-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (6-[18F]FDG) was studied in EMT6 cells, tumors and muscle and correlated to GLUT1 and GLUT5 expression levels. Fructose-derivative 6-[18F]FDF revealed higher tumor uptake than structural analog 1-[18F]FDF while 1-[18F]FDAM with locked anomeric configuration showed similar low tumor uptake as 1-[18F]FDF. Glucose-derivative 6-[18F]FDG reached maximum tumor uptake at 20 min with no further accumulation over time. Uptake of 2-[18F]FDG was highest and continuously increasing due to metabolic trapping through phosphorylation by hexokinase II. In EMT6 tumors, GLUT5 mRNA expression was 20,000-fold lower compared to GLUT1. While latter one was much higher in tumor than in muscle tissue (GLUT1 50:1), opposite was found for GLUT5 mRNA expression (GLUT5 1:6). GLUT5 protein levels were higher in tumor versus muscle tissue as determined by Western Blot and immunohistochemistry. Our data suggest that tumor uptake of fructose metabolism-targeting radiotracers 1-[18F]FDF, 6-[18F]FDF and 1-[18F]FDAM does not correlate with GLUT5 mRNA levels but link to GLUT5 protein levels. In conclusion, our results highlight the importance of detailed biochemical studies on GLUT protein expression levels in combination with PET imaging studies for functional characterization of GLUTs in BC.",

In the past, several attempts have been made to optimize femoral tunnel placement. It was observed that the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus was always located directly below to the desired femoral ACL tunnel position, when the knee was brought to deep flexion (u003e 120\u00b0). The goal of the present study was to verify the hypothesis that the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus can be used as a landmark for femoral tunnel placement.",

        "abstract": "Identifying non-addictive opioid medications is a high priority in medical sciences, but \u03bc-opioid receptors mediate both the analgesic and addictive effects of opioids. We found a significant pharmacodynamic difference between morphine and methadone that is determined entirely by heteromerization of \u03bc-opioid receptors with galanin Gal1 receptors, rendering a profound decrease in the potency of methadone. This was explained by methadone's weaker proficiency to activate the dopaminergic system as compared to morphine and predicted a dissociation of therapeutic versus euphoric effects of methadone, which was corroborated by a significantly lower incidence of self-report of \"high\" in methadone-maintained patients. These results suggest that \u03bc-opioid-Gal1 receptor heteromers mediate the dopaminergic effects of opioids that may lead to a lower addictive liability of opioids with selective low potency for the \u03bc-opioid-Gal1 receptor heteromer, exemplified by methadone.",
