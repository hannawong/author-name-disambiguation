        "abstract": "This study was aimed to investigate the correlation of coagulation indicators [prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT) and fibrinogen (FIB), antithrombinIII (ATIII), D-dimer (D-D) levels] with inflammatory markers [procalcitonin (PCT), C reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum amyloid A (SAA)] for sepsis in hematologic malignancy patients. A total of 326 febrile in patients with hematologic diseases from 2062 patients in West China Hospital, Sichuan University from March 2011 to April 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into sepsis group(n = 72), non-sepsis group(n = 176) and non-sepsis with low Alb group (n = 78) according to blood culture. The results showed that the values of PT, APTT, D-dimer, Plt in sepsis group were higher than those in non-sepsis group, and the difference between them was statistically significant. While the ATIII level in the sepsis group was lower than that in non-sepsis group, and the difference between them was statistically significant (P < 0.05). And the four inflammatory biomarkers in the sepsis patients were higher than those in non-sepsis patients (P < 0.05). TT and FIB level were not significantly different (P > 0.05). There was not a significant difference in these indicators between non-sepsis group and non-sepsis with low Alb group. The correlation analysis suggested that the level of PCT positively correlated with APTT, D-dimer level (P < 0.05); and negatively correlated with the ATIII (P < 0.05). It is concluded that sepsis results in the concurrent activation of inflammatory and procoagulant pathways. The hematologic malignancy patients with sepsis have an obviously higher systemic inflammatory response, and accompanied with coagulation dysfunction.",

Methods A total of 36 patients with femoral hernia were randomly divided into 2 groups to receive respectively PHS or Plug repair procedure. Data collected included; operative time, hospital stay, postoperative complications and recurrence rate. Results In PHS and Plug groups, the operative time were (42±7) min and (41±4) min respectively, the hospital stay was (4. 1±1. 0) d and (4.4±1. 2) d respectively. During the follow up period from 6 to 30 months,there was no recurrence, one case of scrotal hydrocele in PHS group, and there were two cases of recurrence and one case of ecchymoma in Plug group. Five patients complained of foreign body feeling in Plug group, and no patient in PHS group ( P < 0. 05 ). Conclusions Tension-free herniorrhaphy with PHS is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of femoral hernia.",

The approach, which appears to be conceptually appealing and computationally efficient and is referred to as an eigenvalue perturbation approach, seeks to characterize the analytical and asymptotic properties of eigenvalues of matrix-valued functions or operators. The essential problem dwells on the asymptotic behavior of the critical eigenvalues on the imaginary axis, that is, on how the imaginary eigenvalues may vary with respect to the varying parameter. This behavior determines whether the imaginary eigenvalues cross from one half plane into another, and hence plays a critical role in determining the stability of such systems. Our results reveal that the eigenvalue asymptotic behavior can be characterized by solving a simple generalized eigenvalue problem, leading to numerically efficient stability conditions.",

        "abstract": "To explore characteristics of the development of coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP) at present and trend in the future, we investigated 16,154 coal miners exposed to dust for at least 1 yr in the Tiefa Colliery in China. Occupational categories were divided into tunneling, mining, combining and helping. Four cohorts (before 1958, 1958-, 1968-, and after 1978) were created according to years of first exposure. Life-Table Method was used to calculate cumulative incidence rates of CWP adjusted by duration of dust exposure and predict the number of the new CWP patients. Results indicated that cumulative incidence rates of CWP in four cohorts were 26.65%, 18.94%, 1.15%, and 0.06%, respectively (Chi(2)=493.57, p<0.0001). The 55-yr cumulative rate of CWP of tunneling miners (25.90%) or that of combining miners (14.53%) was statistically higher than that of mining miners (7.26%) or that of helping miners (0.89%). The number of new CWP patients predicted in future was approximately 77. New CWP patients predicted would mainly occur among coal miners with first dust exposure in 1958-1967 and those working at tunneling. Most of them could be diagnosed in the age group from 45 to 75 and in the period of the next 20 yr from 2008 to 2028.",

        "abstract": "Occupational exposure to crystalline silica (CS) particles leads to silicosis, which is characterized by chronic inflammation and abnormal tissue repair. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) play a crucial role in the process of silicosis. Previously, we demonstrated positive effect of dioscin on silicosis through modulating macrophage-elicited innate immune response. However, the concrete molecular mechanism remains to be discovered.  We established experimental model of silicosis with wildtype and Atg5Dppa3 mice and oral administrated dioscin daily to explore the effects of dioscin on macrophages and pulmonary fibrosis. AM cell line MH-S with Atg5 silence was used to explore specific function of dioscin on macrophage-derived inflammation and the underlying molecular mechanism.  Dioscin could promote autophagy in macrophages. Dioscin-triggered AMs autophagy limited mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) mass stimulated by CS, reduced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway activation and facilitated cell survival. Relieved oxidative stress resulted in decreased secretion of inflammatory factors and chemokines. Dioscin treatment alleviated macrophage-derived inflammation and subsequent abnormal collagen repair. All the dioscin's protective effects were diminished in Atg5Dppa3 mice.  Dioscin promoting autophagy leads to reduced CS-induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis and cytokine production in AMs, which may provide concrete molecular mechanism for the therapy of silicosis.",

Methods: Tissue digestion was used to isolate and cultivate the rat primary hippocampal neurons, and the adenovirus vector was used to specifically silence the RARα; Real-Time PCR was used to analyze the influence of silenced RARα in retinoic acid (RA) receptors and the markers of nerve cells; live cell imaging analysis was performed to analyze the influence of the calcium excitability of neurons silenced RARα. Results: The immunofluorescence results showed that 90% of the isolated cells expressed the neuron marker neuron-specific enolase (NSE), the adenoviral transfection efficiency was up to 80%. The PCR results showed the expression of RARα in silenced RARα neuron was decreased by 75% (P<0.01), the other receptors were significantly decreased (P<0.01), but RARβ was significantly increased (P<0.05). The live cell calcium imaging results showed the calcium excitability in silent group was significantly reduced (P<0.05), however all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) pretreatment for 24 h could significantly enhance the calcium excitability (P<0.01). Conclusion: The absence of RARα can significantly reduce the neuron marker NSE expression of the primary hippocampal neurons, and significantly damage the neuronal calcium excitability.",

        "abstract": "Iodine is a significant micronutrient. Iodine deficiency (ID)-induced hypothyroxinemia and hypothyroidism during developmental period can cause cerebellar dysfunction. However, mechanisms are still unclear. Therefore, the present research aims to study effects of developmental hypothyroxinemia caused by mild ID and hypothyroidism caused by severe ID or methimazole (MMZ) on parallel fiber-Purkinje cell (PF-PC) synapses in filial cerebellum. Maternal hypothyroxinemia and hypothyroidism models were established in Wistar rats using ID diet and deionized water supplemented with different concentrations of potassium iodide or MMZ water. Birth weight and cerebellum weight were measured. We also examined PF-PC synapses using immunofluorescence, and western blot analysis was conducted to investigate the activity of Neurexin1/cerebellin1 (Cbln1)/glutamate receptor d2 (GluD2) tripartite complex. Our results showed that hypothyroxinemia and hypothyroidism decreased birth weight and cerebellum weight and reduced the PF-PC synapses on postnatal day (PN) 14 and PN21. Accordingly, the mean intensity of vesicular glutamate transporter (VGluT1) and Calbindin immunofluorescence was reduced in mild ID, severe ID, and MMZ groups. Moreover, maternal hypothyroxinemia and hypothyroidism reduced expression of Neurexin1/Cbln1/GluD2 tripartite complex. Our study supports the hypothesis that developmental hypothyroxinemia and hypothyroidism reduce PF-PC synapses, which may be attributed to the downregulation of Neurexin1/Cbln1/GluD2 tripartite complex.

        "abstract": "Soil erosion models and crop growth simulation models are often used to assess the potential impact of climate variations.Most simulation models require daily weather data,which are frequently synthesized using stochastic daily weather generators.The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of the CLImate GENerator(CLIGEN) to generate non-precipitation parameters,including daily temperatures,solar radiation,and wind velocity at twelve standard meteorological stations on the Loess Plateau.The results demonstrated that the CLIGEN model reproduced daily maximum temperature reasonably well.In comparison,daily minimum and dew point temperature were less well reproduced,probably because of the range check imposed in the model and used the standard deviation of minimum temperature to compute dew point.Daily solar radiation and wind velocity were less well generated than temperature;especially for wind velocity the generated data were significantly greater than the measured data.Both means and standard deviations of the same day temperature range and one day lag temperature ranges of the CLIGEN-generated data were consistently greater than those of the measured data on all sites.But the means were better reproduced than the standard deviations.Temperature tends to change in a gradual and continuous manner,but CLIGEN generated data did not reproduced this trend.Seasonal serial correlations of maximum and minimum temperatures were well reproduced,but those of solar radiation and cross correlation between temperature and solar radiation were poorly reproduced by the CLIGEN model.There were no day to day correlations for the CLIGEN-generated data,including solar radiation,maximum and minimum temperature.",

        "abstract": "To validate a free-breathing dynamic contrast-enhanced-MRI (DCE-MRI) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients using gadoxetic acid, and to determine the relationship between DCE-MRI parameters and histological results.Thirty-four HCC patients were included in this prospective study. Free-breathing DCE-MRI data was acquired preoperatively on a 3.0 Tesla scanner. Perfusion parameters (K (trans), K ep, V e and the semi-quantitative parameter of initial area under the gadolinium concentration-time curve, iAUC) were calculated and compared with tumor enhancement at contrast-enhanced CT. The relationship between DCE-MRI parameters and Ki67 indices, histological grades and microvascular density (MVD) was determined by correlation analysis. Differences of perfusion parameters between different histopathological groups were compared. Receiver operation characteristic (ROC) analysis of discriminating high-grades (grade III and IV) from low-grades (grade I and II) HCC was performed for perfusion parameters.Significant relationship was found between DCE-MRI and CT results. The DCE-MRI derived K (trans) were significantly negatively correlated with Ki-67 indices (rho = - 0.408, P = 0.017) and the histological grades (rho = - 0.444, P = 0.009) of HCC, and K ep and V e were significantly related with tumor MVD (rho = - 0.405, P = 0.017 for K ep; and rho = 0.385, P = 0.024 for V e). K (trans), K ep, and iAUC demonstrated moderate diagnostic performance (iAUC = 0.78, 0.77 and 0.80, respectively) for discriminating high-grades from low-grades HCC without significant differences.The DCE-MRI derived parameters demonstrated weak but significant correlations with tumor proliferation status, histological grades or microvascular density, respectively. This free-breathing DCE-MRI is technically feasible and offers a potential avenue toward non-invasive evaluation of HCC malignancy.",

        "abstract": "Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are highly conserved signal transduction pathways, which play a wide variety of important roles in extracellular signal transduction. The first MAPK gene of the maize pathogen Curvularia lunata, Clk1, was isolated via a PCR-based approach with a primer pair designed on the basis of conserved regions of known MAPKs. Southern blot analysis showed that the gene existed in the genome as a single copy. The predicted amino acid sequence (352 amino acids) was highly homologous with MAP kinases of other phytopathogenic fungi. Flanking regions of Clk1 were obtained through RACE and genomic walking technology. To understand the role of Clk1 in C. lunata, targeted gene disruption was adopted to construct Clk1 mutants. It was found that mutants lacking functional domain of Clk1 were not able to produce conidia but tended to form a few special chlamydospore-shaped structures. Clk1 mutants grew slower in adverse environments (at 24°C), produced less cell degrading enzymes (CWDEs) than the wild type, and they were almost unable to infect maize leaves via artificial wounds. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

No postoperative wound infections, chronic postoperative pain or local foreign body sensation occurred in either group. Six patients (14.3 %) in the experimental group and five (11.6 %) in the control group developed scrotal hydroceles (P > 0.05); all resolved with conservative management. There were no recurrences in the experimental group, while there were three (6 %) in the control group (P > 0.05) and all occurred in patients with Gilbert type 3 hernias.Lichtenstein hernioplasty using ACTM grafts has comparable safety and efficacy to traditional high ligation of the indirect hernia sac in adolescent patients.

        "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation was reported to be induced by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinonma (HCC) patients with a high incidence. The effective strategy to reduce hepatitis flares due to HBV reactivation in this specific group of patients was limited to lamivudine. This retrospective study was aimed to investigate the efficacy of prophylactic entecavir in HCC patients receiving TACE.A consecutive series of 191 HBV-related HCC patients receiving TACE were analyzed including 44 patients received prophylactic entecavir. Virologic events, defined as an increase in serum HBV DNA level to more than 1 log10 copies/ml higher than nadir the level, and hepatitis flares due to HBV reactivation were the main endpoints.Patients with or without prophylactic were similar in host factors and the majorities of characteristics regarding to tumor factors, HBV status, liver function and LMR. Notably, cycles of TACE were parallel between the groups. Ten (22.7%) patients receiving prophylactic entecavir reached virologic response. The patients receiving prophylactic entecavir presented significantly reduced virologic events (6.8% vs 54.4%, p=0.000) and hepatitis flares due to HBV reactivation (0.0% vs 11.6%, p=0.039) compared with patients without prophylaxis. Kaplan-Meier analysis illustrated that the patients in the entecavir group presented significantly improved virologic events free survival (p=0.000) and hepatitis flare free survival (p=0.017). Female and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 2 was the only significant predictors for virological events in patients without prophylactic antiviral. Rescue antiviral therapy did not reduce the incidence of hepatitis flares due to HBV reactivation.Prophylactic entecavir presented promising efficacy in HBV-related cancer patients receiving TACE. Lower performance status and female gender might be the predictors for HBV reactivation in these patients.",

        "abstract": "Objective Adequate nutrition during infancy is fundamental to the development of each child's full human potential.It is well recognized that the period from birth to one year of age is a 'critical window' for the promotion of optimal growth,health and behavioral development.Many infant feeding recommendations were issued by WHO in the past decade.The current study aims at investigating feeding practices following the latest infant feeding recommendation issued by WHO in 2002.Methods A cross-section investigation was conducted in the department of primary child care,Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University,which was located in southwest of China,from June 2008 to May 2009.Total 978 healthy infants who were recieving regular physical examination in the hospital were recruited unrandomly,including 529/976(54.2%) boys and 447/976(45.8%) girls,aged 2 months(n=7),3 months(n=45),4 months(n=124),5 months(n=233),6 months(n=283),7 months(n=107),8 months(n=86),9 months(n=45),10 months(n=30),11months(n=10),12 months(n=8),respectively.A questionnaire was used to collect information of infants' data and feeding practice which was assessed by 24-hours recall from their major dependents.The anthropometric data of infants including weight and length were measured by qualified nurses using standard instruments and following standard protocol.Weight-for-length Z-score(WLZ),weight-for-age Z-score(WAZ) and length-for-age Z-score(LAZ) were calculated with Anthro software(version 3,April 2009).Means of weight,length,WLZ,WAZ and LAZ at different ages were compared with WHO growth standards using t tests.Results There was a considerable variety of feeding practices compared with the latest infant feeding recommendation issued by WHO.About 89.8% infants were breastfed,of whom 41.5% of whom were exclusively breastfed after delivery,however,10.2% of the infants had never been breastfed.The proportion of breastfed infants was 25/45(55.6%) at 3 months,53/124(42.7%) at 4 months,114/233(48.9%) at 5 months and 100/283(35.3%)at 6 months,respectively.The proportion of exclusively breastfed infants was 15/45(33.3%) at 3 months,27/124(21.8%) at 4 months,23/233(11.2%) at 5 months,respectively.By the age of 6 months,the rate of exclusive breastfeeding was dramatically decreased to 15/283(5.3%).It did not meet the standard of exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months(180 days) recommended by WHO.The time of introducing complementary food varied,with 8.8% of infants being introduced complementary foods before 4 months,and the percentage increased to 66.0% during 4-5 months,12.3% after 6 months,respectively.First food introduced to infancy was infant rice powder(65.5%),yolk(17.2%),vegetable or fruit(9.3%),homemade rice(7.4%) or fish(0.6%),respectively.The median age of introducing infant rice powder,gruels,yolk,vegetable,fruit,meat,fish,rice,noodle and bean was 4.5,5.7,5.2,5.1,5.1,6.7,6.8,7.9,6.6 and 7.0 months.Physical growth of the group of infants was above the WHO reference regardless of the time of complementary feeding during 2-12 months of age.Both infants' weights reached up to the average level of WHO growth curve 2005(P>0.05),whether or not exclusive breastfeeding was taken during 4-6 months.Mean and standard deviation of WLZ was 0.7±1.1,0.7±0.9,0.6±0.9,0.6±0.9,0.7±1.0,0.6±0.9,0.6±0.8,0.4±0.8,0.6±1.0,1.0±0.6 that differred significantly from zero(P<0.05) during 3-11 months,respectively.There was no difference found in WLZ,WAZ,and LAZ among the different feeding practice groups at 4th-6th month.Conclusions The current study indicated a unsatisfactory compliancy to WHO recommendation in infant feeding.Compared with WHO recommendation,the study sample showed lower pure breastfeeding rate,but higher proportion of formular feeding in the first 6 months.However,there was few significant difference in growth status associated with early infant feeding practice during the first year in our study.",

The issue under investigation dwells on the question: What is the largest delay range within which a distributed control protocol is able to achieve and maintain the consensus? We consider several second-order agents with different poles distributing on the complex plane communicating over an undirected network topology, and derive bounds on the delay margin. The results show that for a strictly unstable second-order multi-agent system, its consensuability robustness depends on the pole locations of the agents, as well as on the eigen-ratio of the network graph.",

        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a recently observed process by which double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) directs sequence-specific degradation of messenger RNA (mRNA) in animal and plant cells. In several model systems, RNAi had been developed into a useful tool for the investigation of gene function. In order to study the effectiveness of RNAi in mammalian cells, we introduced chemically synthetic 21-nucleotide small interference RNA (siRNA) duplexes into 293T/GFP cells, which were transduced by enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) gene, by means of TransIT-TKO, Oligofectamine reagent, Lipofectamine 2000 respectively. The results demonstrated that EGFP expression was significantly and specifically inhibited by the corresponding dsRNA, but not by unrelated dsRNA. In three different vectors, Lipofectamine 2000 demonstrated the highest transfection efficiency with a 48 h exposure. The decrease in EGFP fluorescence intensity was approximately 80%. Although TransIT-TKO and Oligofectamine displayed similar trends, the transfections were inefficient, and often toxic. The results also exhibited that siRNA inhibited the EGFP gene expression in a dose and time-dependent manner. Therefore, we concluded that the Lipofectamine 2000 was a better transfection reagent for RNAi. RNAi pathway seems operative in mammalian embryo cells. RNAi may be developed into a potential tool for gene therapy.",

To improve its phytoextracting efficiency, restriction enzyme-mediated integration was used to construct Trichoderma mutants with higher Cd resistance. Of 200 mutants, 10 mutants were shown with higher Cd tolerance and enhanced ability of removing Cd from growth medium. In pot experiment, mutant P6 significantly alleviated the negative impacts of Cd on oilseed rape growth, and improved the Cd uptake ability of oilseed rape shoot in Cd contaminated soil (p<0.05). Based on the dry weight, the amounts of Cd in shoots of mutant P6 treated oilseed rape were increased by 23% and 38% per pot compared with wild type Trichoderma treatment; 53% and 107% against non-inoculated treatment, respectively, at 20 and 50mgCdkg(-1) soil. The results suggested the Trichoderma mutant-oilseed rape symbiosis system could be used in remediation of soil contaminated with heavy metal Cd.",

For example, conidium germination of strain Ttrm31 was higher than that of wild strain T21, while Ttrm47 and Ttrm94 were negative performance. The conidium productivity of Ttrm34 was higher than that of wild strain T21. However, Ttrm94 and Ttrm111 did not produce conidia at all. As for the tolerance to high-temperature, Ttrm31, Ttrm34, Ttrm47 and Ttrm76 were enhanced remarkably relative to wild strains, but Ttrm55, Ttrm94 and Ttrm111 not. Meanwhile, it was interesting that the growth of transformed Trichoderma strains was improved much once treated under high temperature (50 ℃) for 1 hour. Ttrm55 and Ttrm76 grew faster under low temperature (15 ℃), but Ttrm47, Ttrm76 and Ttrm111 grew faster under high temperature (30 ℃). The transformed Trichoderma strains differed in cultural morphology, including color and sporulation, at different pHs and even on different PDAs. Their utilization of carbon and nitrogen nutrition was also different. Protein and asparagines were screened as better nitrogen sources, while glucose and maltose as better carbon sources. Thecolor of colony was also different. For example, Ttrm94 and Ttrm111 were yellow, but the others were green.",

        "abstract": "To understand the functions of transcription factor OsNAC5 in response to abiotic stress, we generated transgenic rice plants with knockdown OsNAC5 by RNA-interfered (RNAi) and overexpressing OsNAC5, and investigated the effects of cold, drought and salt stress on wild-type (WT), RNAi and overexpression rice lines. Our results demonstrated that RNAi lines became less tolerant to these stresses than WT plants, while overexpression of OsNAC5 in Arabidopsis and rice enhanced tolerance to these stresses. The mechanisms underlying the changes in tolerance of the transgenic rice plants to abiotic stresses were explored by measuring free proline (Pro) and soluble sugar contents in WT and transgenic plants. Accumulation of Pro and soluble sugars was positively correlated with OsNAC5 expression levels. The less accumulation of Pro in RNAi lines may be accounted for by inhibition of Pro synthesis and transport at transcriptional levels. In addition, knockdown and overexpression of OsNAC5 enhanced and reduced accumulation of malondialdehyde and H(2)O(2), suggesting that knockdown of OsNAC5 renders RNAi plants more susceptible to oxidative damage. The RNAi lines displayed higher Na(+)/K(+) ratio due to greater accumulation of Na(+) ions than WT under salt stress conditions, and expression of genes encoding tonoplast Na(+)/H(+) antiporter was lower in RNAi lines than in WT under both control and salt-stressed conditions. Seed germination of RNAi and overexpression plants was more and less inhibited by salt and mannitol than that of WT, respectively. Seed germination of overexpression and RNAi plants was more and less sensitive than that of WT to ABA. These findings highlight the important role of OsNAC5 played in the tolerance of rice plants to abiotic stress by regulating downstream targets associated with accumulation of compatible solutes, Na(+) ions, H(2)O(2) and malondialdehyde.",

Two developmental rat models were established with either an iodine-deficient diet, or propylthiouracil-adulterated water (5 ppm) to impair thyroid function, in pregnant rats from gestational day 6 until postnatal day 28. The protein levels of p35, cyclin-dependent kinase 5, β-catenin, and N-cadherin were assessed on postnatal day 14, 21, and 28. Dendritic morphogenesis of newborn granule neurons in dentate gyrus was examined. Developmental hypothyroidism induced by iodine deficiency and PTU treatment delayed the maturation of hippocampal granule neurons in the offspring and decreased the percentage of Dcx-positive neurons that expressed β-catenin on postnatal day 21 and 28. In addition, downregulation of p35 was observed in dentate gyrus of hypothyroid groups. Developmental hypothyroidism induced by iodine deficiency and PTU treatment could delay the maturation of newborn granule neurons in dentate gyrus, and this deficit may be attributed to the downregulation of p35.",

Their structures were confirmed by 1H NMR and HRMS. Preliminary in vivo pharmacological trials showed that most of the synthesized compounds revealed analgesic effects. Among the tested compounds, 8, 13 and 22 exhibited potent analgesic activities in both mice writhing and mice hot plate model.

From a total of 450 mutants, six mutants that showed significant influence on maize resistance to C. lunata were analyzed in detail. Maize coated with these mutants was more susceptible to C. lunata compared with those coated with a wild-type (WT) strain. Similar to other fungal ATMT libraries, all six mutants were single copy integrations, which occurred preferentially in noncoding regions (except two mutants) and were frequently accompanied by the loss of border sequences. Two mutants (T66 and T312) that were linked to resistance were characterized further. Maize seeds coated with T66 and T312 were more susceptible to C. lunata than those treated with WT. Moreover, the mutants affected the resistance of maize to C. lunata by enhancing jasmonate-responsive gene expression. T66 and T312 induced maize resistance to C. lunata infection through a jasmonic acid-dependent pathway.",

The results based on orthogonal experiment showed that the components of the optimal solid culture medium followed the following ratio of matter : rice straw to bran (9:1);solid materials to water (1:1);1% (NH4)2SO4 , and 0.1% Tween-20. Moreover, the single- factor fermentation experiment on the mutant for improving cellulase activity indicated that the optimal culture condition should be : inoculum volume (5%～7.5%);temperature, 30 ℃;incubation time, 96 h;pH value, neutral pH value. And under these conditions, the FPA and carboxyl methyl cellulase activity of T. koningii REMI mutant reached 6.097 IU/g and 8.123 IU/g respectively",

We studied three SNPs in the promoter region of IL-28B gene at the positions rs12979860,rs12980275 and rs8099917 by HRM analysis (high-resolution melting curve analysis).Hepatic allograft dysfunction was more likely to be associated with IL-28B SNPs. However, there was no significant difference in the frequencies of IL-28B gene distribution in recipients with or without HBV recurrence.IL-28B gene polymorphism may be associated with the prognosis of LT recipients but it needs more experiments.",

In the analysis, concepts from information theory such as entropy play an instrumental role. We first propose an information-theoretic notion termed Gaussianity-whiteness to measure how Gaussian and white an asymptotically stationary stochastic process is. Subsequently, we derive lower bounds on estimation error variance which can be quantified explicitly by the Gaussianity-whiteness of the noises. Furthermore, the bounds are found to be tight in the particular case of a scalar linear time-invariant system with white Gaussian noises, as verified by the benchmark given by the renowned Kalman filter.",

Disorders of the maternal thyroid hormone (TH) during pregnancy can cause adverse effects on the fetus. We investigated the effects and possible mechanism of perinatal DEHP exposure on the thyroid function of pups. Pregnant female Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups and received doses of DEHP of 0, 30, 300, 750 mg/kg/day by gavage at from gestational day (GD) 0 to postnatal day (PN) 21. The concentration of serum THs and the ultrastructure of thyroid follicular cells in the offspring were examined. Related protein level and gene expression of thyroid proteins in pups were analyzed by western blotting and real-time PCR. We found that DEHP significantly reduced total thyroxine (TT) and increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in pups, while total triiodothyronine (TT) showed no change. Thyroid follicular cells ultrastructure was damaged in DEHP exposed pups as viewed by electron microscopy. Furthermore, exposure to DEHP significantly increased protein and mRNA levels of thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), paired box 8 (PAX8), sodium iodide symporter (NIS) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) in pups. In addition, levels of deiodinases of pups were also affected. These findings indicated that DEHP can disrupt thyroid function by damaging thyroid follicles and affecting TTF-1, PAX8, NIS, TPO and the deiodinase protein family.",

        "abstract": "Therapeutic angiogenesis is a pivotal strategy for ischemic heart disease. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect and molecular mechanism of Shexiang Baoxin pills, a widely-used traditional Chinese medicine for ischemic heart disease, on angiogenesis in a rat model of myocardial infarction (MI).We used the occlusion of left anterior descending coronary artery of Sprague-Dawley rats as a model of MI. The MI rats were treated with distilled water, Shexiang Baoxin pills, or Shexiang Baoxin pills + HET0016 (a selective blocker of the biosynthesis of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) at 10 mg/kg/day), respectively. Sham-operated rats were used as controls.Treatment with Shexiang Baoxin pills increases the level of serum 20-HETE in MI rats, which can be suppressed by HET0016 treatment. Shexiang Baoxin pills shows cardio-protective effects on MI rats, including improving cardiac function, decreasing infarction area, and promoting angiogenesis in peri-infarct area. The protective effects of Shexiang Baoxin pills are partly inhibited by HET0016. Furthermore, Shexiang Baoxin pills enhances the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and the expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), based on immunohistochemical analysis, in peri-infarct area of MI rats, which is partly suppressed by HET0016.Shexiang Baoxin pills may partially participate in angiogenesis in MI rats. The protective mechanism of Shexiang Baoxin pills may be mediated via up-regulation of 20-HETE, which promotes EPCs mobilization and VEGF expression.",

Before making appropriate strategy for patients with NF-pNETs ≤2 cm, pathological confirmation is vital. Incidentally diagnosed, sporadic small NF-pNETs may bring aggressive behavior and poor prognosis, such as extrapancreatic extension, lymph nodal metastasis, distant metastasis and recurrence, even causing disease-related death. Understanding and formulating an appropriate strategy for the patients with sporadic small, non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have been controversial for some time. Although several studies have reported that patients with NF-pNETs ≤2 cm had less rate of malignant behavior compared with larger ones (>2 cm); and the surgery approach may leading to surgery-related pancreatic complications; but there is still a lack of level I evidence to convince surgeons to abandon all cases with sporadic small NF-pNETs. Based on an updated literature search and review, the members of the Chinese Study Group for Neuroendocrine Tumors (CSNET) from high-volume centers have reached a consensus on the issue of the management strategy for the sporadic small NF-pNETs. We recommend that, except for some selected patients with NF-pNETs <1 cm, incidentally discovered and unacceptable surgical risks, all others with NF-pNETs ≤2 cm should undergo tumor resection with lymph node dissection or at least lymph node sampling and careful postoperative surveillance.",

The effects of feed ratio of NIPAAm and CMCH, temperature, pH and ionic strength on the swelling ratio of PNIPAAm/CMCH hydrogels were studied. The results show that the addition of CMCH shifts the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the PNIPAAm hydrogel to higher temperature. The PNIPAAm/CMCH hydrogel displays not only pH- and thermo- sensitivity, but also ion-sensitivity. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was applied for the determination of the LCST of the hydrogel. © 2010 Shanghai University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

This paper studies performance limitation and design tradeoff issues in the analysis and design of linear time-invariant, single-input single-output feedback control systems. We develop a number of integral constraints, which extend the classical Bode/Poisson sensitivity and complementary sensitivity integrals. The new integral relations lead to new insights into the study of fundamental limitation and design tradeoff issues, and together with the classical results, enable a more refined and more informative performance analysis",

The 63 major varieties and parental lines, as well as 41 major F1 hybrids, were genotyped with the markers. Alleles detected in each line at each marker locus were verified. By matching marker genotypes of corresponding F1, maternal and paternal lines of hybrid rice, high reliability of the maternal lines was verified, data on the paternal lines were modified, and a false hybrid was removed. A database containing genotype data of 103 major rice varieties and parental lines at the 24 marker loci was constructed and analyzed.",

Results show that the full length cDNA of the C. lunata Brn1 gene contains 1001 base pairs and an 801 bp open reading frame encoding 267 amino acids. Semi-quantitative PCR analysis shows that the expression of Brn1 at 96 h is significantly higher than at 24 and 72 h (p < 0. 05) in both the highly virulent isolate CX-3 and the weakly virulent isolate DD60. Brn1-silenced transformants were light brown in culture filtrate, and have significantly reduced toxin production relative to the wild-type. These results imply that Brn1 gene in C. lunata is not only involved in 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene melanin synthesis, but is also relatively associated with toxin biosynthesis of the pathogen. © 2011 KNPV.",

        "abstract": "Developmental iodine deficiency (ID) leads to inadequate thyroid hormone that impairs learning and memory with an unclear mechanism. Here, we show that hippocampal calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), calmodulin and calcineurin are implicated in the impaired spatial memory in adolescent rats following developmental ID and hypothyroidism. Three developmental rat models were created by administrating dam rats with either iodine-deficient diet or propylthiouracil (PTU, 5 or 15 ppm)-added drinking water from gestational day (GD) 6 till postnatal day (PN) 28. Then, the spatial memory to a water maze test was studied in pups before PN42. After testing periods, the latency to platform and the number of error in iodine-deficient and 15 ppm PTU-treatment groups were significantly higher than those in the controls (P < 0.05). Total and phosphorylated CaMKII, calmodulin, and calcineurin in the hippocampus were detected with both the immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Without going through water maze test, iodine-deficient and 15 ppm PTU-treatment groups showed significantly lower CaMKII and calmodulin and significantly higher calcineurin than the controls in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions (P < 0.05). After trials of water maze task, however, CaMKII and calmodulin were up-regulated and calcineurin was down-regulated in control group (P < 0.05), but not in iodine-deficient and 15 ppm PTU-treatment groups. Data indicate that hippocampal CaMKII, calmodulin, and calcineurin are involved in the impaired spatial memory induced by developmental ID and hypothyroidism.",

Activated alveolar macrophages released increased amounts of transforming growth factor-beta1(TGF-beta1) in response to bleomycin-induced lung injury. Thrombospondin-1(TSP-1) was involved in the activation of latent TGF-beta1(L-TGF-beta1) through the association of the TSP-1/L-TGF-beta1 complex with the cell receptor of TSP-1, CD36. The antagonistic effects of the synthetic peptides were studied by the administration of TSP-1 (447-452) synthetic peptides to the mouse model. The hydroxyproline contents of the TSP-1-treated groups were significantly lower than those of other experimental groups. Inflammation, fibrotic degree and distribution of collagen fibers in the interstitial and alveolar in the TSP-1-treated groups were less than those of the other experimental groups. The expressions of collagen I and III in TSP-1-treated groups were significantly lower than in the other experimental groups. TSP-1 synthetic peptide reduced the tissue fibrotic pathologies and collagen accumulation in the model, resulting in the decreased severity of bleomycin-induced lung injury.",

        "abstract": " We have previously reported the prognostic value of the albumin-to-alkaline phosphatase ratio (AAPR) for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who are not receiving any standard anticancer therapy. However, the prognostic value of the AAPR for HCC patients treated with trans-catheter arterial chemoembolization therapy (TACE) was not investigated.  We retrospectively analysed 372 HCC patients treated with TACE (the training cohort) and applied receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC curves) to identify the best cut-off value for the AAPR in this cohort. Then, univariate analyses by the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analysis by a Cox proportional hazards regression model were conducted. Both comparisons of the ROC curves and the likelihood ratio test (LRT) were employed to evaluate the abilities of different factors in predicting the survival of patients in this cohort. Finally, the prognostic value of the AAPR was validated in two cohorts: one included 202 HCC patients treated with supportive care (validation cohort I), and the other included 82 HCC patients treated with TACE (validation cohort II).  We identified 0.439 as the best cut-off value of the AAPR by ROC curve analysis. An AAPR > 0.439 was significantly correlated with a lower frequency of Child-Pugh grade B, portal vein tumour thrombus (PVTT), T3-4 and lymph node metastasis ( < 0.05). The median overall survival (OS) of the patients with an AAPR > 0.439 was significantly longer than that of those with an AAPR ≤ 0.439 (58.4 m vs 17.8 m, respectively,  < 0.001). The AAPR was identified as an independent prognostic factor after univariate and multivariate analyses ( = 0.636,  = 0.003). The independent prognostic value of the AAPR was also confirmed in validation cohorts I and II. Additionally, we substituted the AAPR for the Child-Pugh grade in the CLIP system and integrated the AAPR into the TNM system. We found that the area under the curve (AUC) of the AAPR-CLIP system was significantly larger than that of the CLIP and the TNM when predicting 3-month, 6-month, 1-year and 2-year survival ( < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the AUCs for the AAPR-CLIP and the AAPR-TNM. The LRT suggested that both AAPR-CLIP and AAPR-TNM had significantly larger χ2 values and smaller AIC values than that of their corresponding primary system ( < 0.05).  The AAPR was an independent prognostic index for the HCC patients treated with TACE. Both AAPR-CLIP and AAPR-TNM outperformed their corresponding primary system in predicting OS in the current study.",

Twenty-four hours after the cell plating, the culture medium was removed and replaced by serum-free DMEM/F12 with B27 supplementation. Half of the culture medium was changed 2-3 times every week. The morphological changes of the neurons were observed under inverted phase-contrast microscope. Immunofluorescence staining for NSE was performed to identify the neurons, and the purity of neurons was calculated. The hippocampal neurons were stained with calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye to monitor the effect of KCl on neuronal excitability by a calcium imaging system.This simplified method is time-saving and cost-effective for primary culture of hippocampal neurons with reduced risk of contamination, and the neurons obtained showed high uniformity, purity and long-term viability.",

Methods:To apply flow cytometry to determine expressions of CD95 and CD28/CD152( CTLA-4) on T cell subsets in patients with ESRF. Results:In comparison between patients group and control group,CD3+T cells and CD4+T cells strikingly increase in patients,the ratio of CD4 and CD8 is increasing(P =0.008) expressions of CD95 on both of CD4+ and CD8+T cells are increasing(P = 0. 001) .however,CD95 is expressed more dominantly on CD8+T cells than on CD4+ T cells; expressions of costimulators on T cell subsets are increasing (P < 0.05) ,in which CD4+CD28+T cells and CD8+CD152+T cells are dominant. Conclusion:Imbalanced T lymphocytic subpopulations and the abnormal expressions of CD28/CD152 in patients with ESRF suggest that activated and suppressed regulations of T cells are disturbed,and expressions of CD95 are more dominant on CD8+T cells,which indicates lymphocytes decrease in patients possibly mainly by two pathways--death receptor-ligand pathway and the suppressed signal induced by negative costimulator CD152, so that the striking reduce of CD8+T cells leads to the defect of cellular immune in patients.",

        "abstract": "Diagram, diagnosis, and treatment with endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for upper gastrointestinal submucosal tumors (SMTs) remain controversial, although endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and ESD have been established in diagnosis and treatment of SMTs in decades, respectively. In this study, we have investigated prospectively the profile of upper gastrointestinal SMTs, assessed the effect and feasibility of ESD in upper gastrointestinal SMTs treatment, as well as value of EUS in pre-ESD diagnosis and post-ESD follow-up for gastrointestinal SMTs.The upper gastrointestinal SMTs patients detected with endoscopy were further checked by EUS, then received series ESD treatment, and fulfilled 3- and 12-month follow-up EUS detection between July 2011 and March 2015. The parameters of SMTs with EUS examination (size, original layer) and treatment with ESD (en bloc resection rate, procedure time, procedure-related complications) were investigated and analyzed.A total number of 224 patients with upper gastrointestinal SMTs were enrolled, and 108 (48.2 %) were men. The mean age was 50.4 ± 12.0 years (range 19-77 years). In total, 92 (41.1 %), 14 (6.3 %), 61 (27.2 %), 22 (9.8 %), 25 (11.2 %), and 10 (4.5 %) SMTs were located in esophagus, cardiac, fundus, body and antrum of stomach, duodenum, respectively. Two hundred and eight (92.9 %) patients were successfully treated with an en bloc ESD, while other 16 patients (7.1 %) suffered ESD failure (5.3 %, 12 case) or severe complications (1.8 %, 4 cases). The mean procedure time of ESD was 47.4 ± 27.3 min (range 10-180 min). The mean size of the SMTs measured with ESD samples was 13.6 ± 9.5 mm (range 4-113 mm). In total, 87 (38.8 %), 23 (10.3 %), and 114 (50.9 %) tumors originated from muscularis mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis propria, respectively. The majority of SMTs were leiomyoma (109, 48.7 %) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) (77, 34.4 %), while other SMTs were confirmed as ectopic pancreas (21, 9.4 %), adenoid tumor (8, 3.6 %), lipoma (5, 2.2 %), neuroendocrine tumor (3, 1.3 %), and granulosa cell tumor (1, 0.4 %). The accuracy rate of EUS in pathological diagnosis or original layer was 82.6 % (185/224) or 74.6 % (167/224). Residual tumors were detected with EUS in 3 patients (1.3 %) in 3-month follow-up and no recurrence during 12-month follow-up period.The predominant SMTs in upper gastrointestinal tract were leiomyoma in esophageal tumors which originated from muscularis mucosae and GIST in stomach which originated from muscularis propria detected satisfactorily with EUS. This study showed that ESD was a safe and effective treatment for upper gastrointestinal SMTs.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we investigate the intrinsic design constraints and performance limits of networked control systems. We propose new information measures and correspondingly, develop an information-theoretic paradigm for analyzing the performance trade-offs and limits in disturbance attenuation over information-constrained networked feedback, which is enabled by a cohesive development of new information measures, Bode-type integral inequalities, and performance bounds. The integrals and bounds incorporate the information measures and serve to quantify the trade-offs and limits in disturbance attenuation for broad classes of networked feedback systems consisting of linear time-invariant plants and causal, possibly nonlinear, time-varying stabilizing controllers communicating over general noisy channels with causal encoders and decoders. The notion of negentropy rate is introduced to address general, non-Gaussian disturbances. The channel blurredness, a newly proposed information measure for the quality of communication channels, is used to characterize the effect of communication channel noises on the integrals and henceforth the trade-offs in disturbance attenuation. Bounds on the power gain, a novel disturbance attenuation measure tailored for performance analysis of networked control systems, provide the fundamental limits of disturbance attenuation achievable by networked feedback.",

The model was used to illustrate the bidirectional effects of both raw material and constraints, especially when the price of raw material was changing rapidly. The most economic formulations were calculated by Lindo 6.0. The reason for raw material unadopted was that their effective components were not matched to price by Reduced cost analysis. The influence of adoptive raw materials was discussed through Sensitivity analysis, and the phosphorus was the most sensitive factor in actual formulations. The sequence of three main elements' shadow price was K > P > N, which indicated the Potassium influenced the total cost mostly.",

The integrals, which are obtained via an information-theoretic approach, characterize explicitly the fundamental performance trade-offs of disturbance attenuation in networked control systems. Two information-theoretic measures, termed negentropy rate and channel blurredness respectively, are proposed to quantify the effect of the multivariate disturbance and communication channel constraints on the Bode-type integrals. In particular, when it comes to parallel additive white Gaussian noise channels, channel blurredness leads to a totally new ‘fire-quenching’ power allocation policy in contrast to the conventional ‘water-filling’ solution.",

        "abstract": "Few studies investigated the prognosis of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC). This study was aimed to determine the prognostic value of differential blood cell counts including blood white cells, neutrophil, lymphocyte, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet in patients with aHCC. A total of 205 ethnic Chinese aHCC patients receiving non-systematic sorafenib were analyzed retrospectively. The prognostic value of differential blood cell counts and NLR for overall survival (OS) was determined by integration into Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score system using backward elimination model of multivariate Cox regression. As a result, NLR was confirmed to be an independent predictor for OS (p = 0.001) with the rest parameters presented negative results. Then, aHCC patients were dichotomized into two groups according to NLR values ≤ 2.43 or >2.43. Patients with low NLR presented lower CLIP score and higher 6-month survival rate (56.1 vs 25.9%) compared with patients with high NLR level. Besides, low NLR level was associated with favorable prognostic factors such as lower α-fetoprotein, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin, as well as decreased incidence of ascites, portal vein thrombosis, and metastasis. Besides, low NLR level was associated less white cells and neutrophil granulocytes, as well as more lymphocyte. In summary, the present study firstly indentified NLR as an independent prognostic factor in aHCC patients receiving no systematic sorafenib.",

        "abstract": "The opioid receptors are a member of G protein-coupled receptors that mediate physiological effects of endogenous opioid peptides and structurally distinct opioid alkaloids. Although it is well characterized that there is differential receptor desensitization and internalization properties following activation by distinct agonists, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We investigated the signaling events of delta-opioid receptor (deltaOR) initiated by two ligands, DPDPE and TIPP. We found that although both ligands inhibited adenylyl cyclase (AC) and activated ERK1/2, only DPDPE induced desensitization and internalization of the deltaOR. We further found that DPDPE, instead of TIPP, could activate GRK2 by phosphorylating the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src and translocating it to membrane receptors. Activation of GRK2 led to the phosphorylation of serine residues in the C-terminal tail, which facilitates beta-arrestin1/2 membrane translocation. Meanwhile, we also found that DPDPE promoted beta-arrestin1 dephosphorylation in a Src-dependent manner. Thus, DPDPE appears to strengthen beta-arrestin function by dual regulations: promoting beta-arrestin recruitment and increasing beta-arrestin dephosphorylation at the plasma membrane in a Src-dependent manner. All effects initiated by DPDPE could be abolished or suppressed by PP2, an inhibitor of Src. Morphine, which has been previously shown to be unable to desensitize or internalize deltaOR, also behaved as TIPP in failure to utilize Src to regulate deltaOR signaling. These findings point to the existence of agonist-specific utilization of Src to regulate deltaOR signaling and reveal the molecular events by which Src modulates deltaOR responsiveness.",

        "abstract": "Iodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormone. Iodine deficiency (ID)-induced hypothyroxinaemia and hypothyroidism during developmental period contribute to impairments of function in the brain, such as psychomotor and motor alterations. However, the mechanisms are still unclear. Therefore, the present research is to study the effects of developmental hypothyroxinaemia caused by mild ID and developmental hypothyroidism caused by severe ID or methimazole (MMZ) on dendritic growth in filial cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) and the underlying mechanisms.A maternal hypothyroxinaemia model was established in Wistar rats using a mild ID diet, and two maternal hypothyroidism models were developed with either severe ID diet or MMZ water. We examined the total dendritic length using immunofluorescence, and Western blot analysis was conducted to investigate the activity of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), stathmin and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII).Hypothyroxinaemia and hypothyroidism reduced the total dendritic length of cerebellar PCs, decreased MAP2 and its phosphorylation, increased stathmin but reduced its phosphorylation and down-regulated the activity of CaMKII and its phosphorylation in cerebellar PCs on postnatal day (PN) 7, PN14 and PN21.Developmental hypothyroxinaemia induced by mild ID and hypothyroidism induced by severe ID or MMZ limit PCs dendritic growth, which may involve in the disturbance of MAP2 and stathmin in a CaMKII-dependent manner. It suggests a potential mechanism of motor coordination impairments caused by developmental hypothyroxinaemia and hypothyroidism.",

The localization of receptors was observed using confocal microscope. DOR-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase was measured using cyclic AMP assay. Western blots were employed to detect the phosphorylation of Akt and the DOR. The effect of A(1)R agonist N(6)-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) on DOR down-regulation was assessed using radioligand binding assay.CHA 1 micromol/L time-dependently attenuated DOR agonist [D-Pen(2,5)]enkephalin (DPDPE)-induced inhibition of intracellular cAMP accumulation with a t(1/2)=2.56 (2.09-3.31) h. Pretreatment with 1 micromol/L CHA for 24 h caused a right shift of the dose-response curve of DPDPE-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation, with a significant increase in EC(50) but no change in E(max). Pretreatment with 1 micromol/L CHA for 1 h also induced a significant attenuation of DPDPE-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt. Moreover, CHA time-dependently phosphorylated DOR (Ser363), and this effect was inhibited by A(1)R antagonist 1,3-Dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX) but not by DOR antagonist naloxone. However, CHA failed to produce the down-regulation of DOR, as neither receptor affinity (K(d)) nor receptor density (B(max)) of DOR showed significant change after chronic CHA exposure.Activation of A(1)R by its agonist caused heterologous desensitization of DOR-mediated inhibition of intracellular cAMP accumulation and phosphorylation of Akt. Activation of A(1)R by its agonist also induced heterologous phosphorylation but not down-regulation of DOR.",

        "abstract": "Both clinical and basic science studies have demonstrated that cardiac remodeling in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) is very common. It is a key feature during the course of heart failure and an important risk factor for subsequent cardiac mortality. Traditional drugs or therapies rarely have effects on cardiac regression of CRF and cardiovascular events are still the first cause of death. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are the products of arachidonic acids metabolized by cytochrome P450 epoxygenases. It has been found that EETs have important biological effects including anti-hypertension and anti-inflammation. Recent data suggest that EETs are involved in regulating cardiomyocyte injury, renal dysfunction, chronic kidney disease (CKD)-related risk factors and signaling pathways, all of which play key roles in cardiac remodeling induced by CRF. This review analyzes the literature to identify the possible mechanisms for EETs to improve cardiac remodeling induced by CRF and indicates the therapeutic potential of EETs in it.",

The tracking performance is measured by an integral square error between the output of the plant and the reference signal. Our purpose is to find the fundamental limit for the attainable tracking performance, under any control structure and parameters, in terms of the characteristics and structural parameters of the given plant, as well as those of the reference signal under consideration. It is shown that this fundamental limit depends on the interaction between the reference signal and the nonminimum phase zeros of the plant and their frequency-dependent directional information.",

        "abstract": "Iodine is essential for the synthesis of triiodothyronine (T₃) and thyroxine (T₄). Iodine deficiency leads to inadequate thyroid hormone. Hypothyroidism induced by iodine deficiency during gestation and postnatal period leads to cognitive deficits in learning and memory. However, the mechanism underlying these deficits is unclear. Calcium-dependent calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) known as a potential memory molecule regulates important neuronal functions including learning and memory. Recent studies have shown that hypothyroidism alters phosphorylation of CaMKII in hippocampus or even in sympathetic ganglia of rats. Though the entorhinal cortex (EC) is an important functional structure within the neuronal network responsible for learning and memory, little is known about the effect of hypothyroidism on phosphorylation of CaMKII in the EC. Here, we report that iodine deficiency and propylthiouracil treatment through gestation and lactation reduce phosphorylation of CaMKII in the EC of pups. The increase of calcineurin, as well as reduction of neurogranin and calmodulin, may account for the reduced phosphorylation of CaMKII induced by developmental iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism. These findings in the EC may contribute to understanding the mechanisms that underlie impairment of learning and memory induced by developmental iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism.",

        "abstract": "Toll-IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor molecule-1 (TICAM1, also called TRIF) is an important adaptor protein in TLR3 and TLR4 signaling pathways that mediate proinflammatory cytokine and IFN responses. Negative regulation of TICAM1 by exogenous viral protease or by endogenous caspase and proteasome have been reported to shut down TICAM1-mediated signaling. In this study, we discovered that down-regulation of TICAM1, but not other components in this signaling pathway, occurred in a natural process of TLR3 activation induced by double-stranded RNA or human rhinovirus (RV) infection in airway epithelial cells and various other cell types. TICAM1 was essential for IFN expression, and the loss of TICAM1 significantly elevated RV production. The low level of TICAM1 protein expression, caused by the prior double-stranded RNA treatment, led to a lack of IFN production upon additional treatment, suggesting receptor desensitization. In follow-up studies, TICAM1 down-regulation was found to be dependent on TLR3 but not RIG1, MDA5, or PKR and appeared to be regulated post-translationally. Neither proteasome nor caspase inhibitors could prevent TICAM1 down-regulation. Instead, a lysosome-mediated process appeared to be involved, suggesting a novel mechanism that is different from previous reports. In conclusion, TICAM1 down-regulation is an essential step in TLR3 activation, and its function is to stop TLR3-mediated IFN production.",

The results indicated that trifluralin could greatly reduced the severity of Verticillium eggplant wilt,with protection duration over 24 d. Temperature significantly affected the efficacy of trifluralin. Better control effect and longer duration was obtained at 20 ℃ and 25 ℃ than at 30 ℃.

        "abstract": "An association between polymorphisms in the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) and the natural course of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the Chinese Han population has been noted. However, it is not known whether these polymorphisms are associated with the risk of developing chronic HBV infection in other racial or ethnic populations. Accordingly, we conducted a candidate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association study in Tibetan and Uygur HBV-infected patients. A total of 1302 subjects including 871 Tibetans and 431 Uygurs were recruited. According to their serological and clinical characteristics, each ethnic group was divided into two groups comprising spontaneous clearance individuals and persistently infected patients. Three SNPs were genotyped by a high resolution melting curve methodology. Among the SNPs, rs2296651 exhibited a minor allele frequency of <0.01. The frequency of allele A at rs4646287 was much higher in Tibetans (9.4% for Tibetans and 4.6% for Uygurs, p<0.001) than in Uygurs, but the frequency of allele A at rs7154439 was the opposite (15.7% for Tibetans and 20.5% for Uygurs, p=0.002). Irrespective of race, no significant differences in the frequency distributions of the three SNP alleles or genotypes were observed between the case and clearance groups. Moreover, none of the NTCP haplotypes were statistically different between the two groups. Data from the Tibetan patients could be grouped by HBeAg status, viral load and HBV genotype; however, no significant differences were found in the SNP genotype distribution for each characteristic. In conclusion, the NTCP polymorphisms we identified tended to be ethnicity-dependent. For Tibetans and Uygurs, no association of the three SNPs (rs7154439, rs4646287 and rs2296651) and their haplotypes with HBV chronicity was observed. Examination of SNPs in NTCP for their specific associations with the course of HBV infection in other ethnic minority groups is now required.",

Industrial hygiene survey and environmental mycological studies were also performed. The average dust concentrations ranged from 13.76 to 29.55 mg/m(3) in the tobacco processing workshops. Also, the numbers of fungi colonies in the processing environments were much higher than those in the control environments. The prevalences of chronic respiratory or nasal symptoms in exposed workers were significantly higher than those in control workers (p<0.05 or p<0.01). The prevalences of lung function abnormalities in the exposed workers were significantly higher than those in control workers (p<0.05). The positive prevalences of specific IgE reactions to fungi (26.92% for A.fumigatus and 51.54% for Rhizopus nigricans) in exposed workers were also significantly higher than those in control workers (p<0.01). The positive prevalences of the skin prick test showed that 18.46% of the exposed workers were positive to A. fumigatus and 23.85% were positive to Rhizopus nigricans. Our results suggested that tobacco processing workers may develop respiratory diseases related to tobacco dust and we consider that fungi might be one of the allergens causing allergic respiratory or nasal diseases in tobacco processing workers.",

Next day, the experimental rats were treated with gamma-interferon (1 x 10(5) IU) daily. Rats were killed in 1 month and 2 month to observe the changes of pathology of lung tissue by use of HE and VG staining, and the expressions of IL-4 and TGF-beta1 by use of immunohistochemical technique and quantitative analysis of protein expressions by image analysis system.(1) The fibrotic degree in silicotic lesions of rat lung was 1/2 approximately 1 grade less in IFN-gamma treated groups than in quartz controls. (2) Quantitative image analysis showed that the integrated optical density (IOD) of IL-4 positive cell in quartz controls in 1 month was (3.33 +/- 1.27) x 10(4) and decreased to (1.99 +/- 0.80) x 10(4) in 2 month, and that of TGF-beta1 positive cell increased from (3.67 +/- 0.63) x 10(4) to (4.90 +/- 1.11) x 10(4); The IOD of IL-4 positive cell in IFN-gamma treated groups was decreased from (2.19 +/- 0.90) x 10(4) to (0.61 +/- 0.22) x 10(4)(P < 0.05), and that of TGF-beta1 positive cell increased from (1.37 +/- 0.31) x 10(4) to (1.76 +/- 0.72) x 10(4) (P < 0.05). At these two time points, the IODof IL-4 and TGF-beta1 positive cell in IFN-gamma treated groups were lower than those in quartz controls (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01).gamma-interferon may inhibit the expressions of IL-4 and TGF-beta1 in silicotic rats.",

        "abstract": "Proteomic approaches using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) were adopted to identify proteins from cucumber leaves differentially expressed in F2 generation of cucumber. Nearly 500 proteins were reproducibly detected, including 39 specific proteins expressed in F2 sensitive pool samples and 22 specific proteins expressed in resistance pool samples, 35 proteins were two-fold upper limit and 46 proteins were two-fold lower limit. Furthermore, analysis with MALD1-TOF-MASS showed that one important protein of disease resistance gene (SSP3110) identified in F2 generation of cucumber associated with defensive reaction. Three proteins (SSP5412, SSP5513, SSP5710) related to respiration or photosynthesis were identified in F2 resistant pool samples, and 14-3-3 brain protein homolog (SSP1411) was identified in F2 sensitive pool samples. All those proteins were probably parts of network of resistance or development-related proteins. This study gives new insights into cucumber powdery mildew resistant response in cucumber leaves and demonstrates the power of the proteomic approach in plant biology studies. MS analysis of other protein spots is underway.",

        "abstract": "Developmental iodine deficiency results in inadequate thyroid hormone (TH), which damages the hippocampus. Here, we explored the roles of hippocampal doublecortin and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)-180 in developmental iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism.Two developmental rat models were established with either an iodine-deficient diet, or propylthiouracil (PTU)-adulterated water (5 ppm or 15 ppm) to impair thyroid function, in pregnant rats from gestational day 6 until postnatal day (PN) 28. Silver-stained neurons and protein levels of doublecortin and NCAM-180 in several hippocampal subregions were assessed on PN14, PN21, PN28, and PN42.The results show that nerve fibers in iodine-deficient and 15 ppm PTU-treated rats were injured on PN28 and PN42. Downregulation of doublecortin and upregulation of NCAM-180 were observed in iodine-deficient and 15 ppm PTU-treated rats from PN14 on. These alterations were irreversible by the restoration of serum TH concentrations on PN42.Developmental iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism impair the expression of doublecortin and NCAM-180, leading to nerve fiber malfunction and thus impairments in hippocampal development.",

A set of 24 markers was selected and proposed for its application in the variety identification of rice, which are distributed on all the 12 rice chromosomes with two markers on each chromosome. The 63 major varieties and parental lines, as well as 41 major F_ 1 hybrids, were genotyped with the markers, and alleles detected at each marker locus were verified. By matching marker genotypes of corresponding F_ 1 , maternal and paternal lines of hybrid rice, high reliability of the maternal lines was verified, data on paternal lines were modified, and a false hybrid was removed. A database containing genotype data of 103 major rice varieties and parental lines at the 24 marker loci was constructed and analyzed. The influence of the authenticity of rice materials on the database quality was discussed, and a threshold for microsatellite marker-based variety identification in rice and an approach for authentification of rice materials and genotype data were proposed.",

Methods Total of 28 patients with esophagus cancer and 46 healthy controls were analyzed for T cells, NK cells, IL-6, TNF-α, and ARPs (CRP, PAB, TRF). Results As compared with control, CD3~+CD4~+T cells were increased (P<0.05) but CD3~+CD8~+T cells were decreased (P < 0.05), thus the ratio was increased (P < 0.05) in patients with esophagus cancer, and the trend was more significant after operation (P < 0.05). NK cells in patients with esophagus cancer were decreased after operation (P < 0.05). The levels of IL-6 and TNF-α in serum of the patients were increased (P < 0.05) and the level of CRP was increased (P < 0.05), but the levels of PAB and TRF were decreased (P < 0.05), and the trend was more significant after operation (P < 0.05). Conclusion In esophagus cancer patients, the disturbance of T lymphocytes leads to the disturbance of cytokines. More and more IL-6 and TNF-α induce liver cells to synthesize ARPs. Positive ARPs such as CRP is increased, while negative ARPs such as PAB and TRF are decreased. This study helps us to learn about immune pathology of esophagus cancer, interpret the mechanisms, and design treat plan.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the safety and efficacy of hernioplasty using acellular tissue matrix patch to repair inguinal hernia of pediatric patients aged 6 to 18 years.Sixty eligible patients aged 6 to 18 years with primary unilateral inguinal hernia were randomly assigned to experimental or control group from June to December 2009. In the experimental group, acellular tissue matrix patch was used during Lichtenstein herniorrhaphy while traditional high ligation of hernial sac was used in the control group. Preoperative and postoperative parameters such as clinical informations of patients, postoperative complications and recurrence rate were recorded and analyzed.There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in postoperative length of stay [(31 ± 8) h vs. (34 ± 11) h] and postoperative Visual Analogue Scale Pain Score (2.8 ± 0.9 vs. 2.6 ± 1.0) (P > 0.05), but the operation time in the experimental group were longer than that in the control group significantly [(39 ± 4) min vs. (36 ± 4) min, t = 3.357, P = 0.001]. The duration of follow-up ranged from 14 to 20 months. There were no postoperative incisional infection, chronic postoperative pain and local foreign body sensation in two groups. In the experimental group, 3 patients suffered scrotal hydrocele as compared 2 patients in the control group. There was no recurrence in the experimental group as compared 2 patients (6.7%) in the control group, which was no significant difference (P > 0.05).Lichtenstein repair for pediatric patients aged 6 to 18 years with acellular tissue matrix patch has good results and with limited postoperative complications.",

        "abstract": "The maize pathotype Cochliobolus lunatus causes Curvularia leaf spot by producing a non-host-specific toxin known as methyl 5-(hydroxymethyl) furan-2-carboxylate (M5HF2C). However, related research that explores the genes that control the production of this toxin is rare. In the current work, Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) was employed to tag the gene required for the biosynthesis of the toxin. Of the 3,000 ATMT transformants recovered, 4 showed a significant decline in pathogenicity on maize leaves; 1 transformant, T806, produced no detectable M5HF2C. Genomic DNA that flanks the integrated plasmid was recovered from one of the mutants. A cosmid clone of the wild-type strain was isolated using the recovered DNA as a probe. The results of the structural and functional analyses of the region corresponding to the tagged site were then used as a basis to successfully clone one gene, called Clt-1. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the gene coded a BTB domain-containing protein that comprises 745 amino acids. Southern analysis revealed that the gene was localized in the genome as a single copy. The essential roles of Clt-1 in both toxin production and pathogenicity were confirmed by gene disruption experiments. In summary, the novel gene Clt-1 is closely associated with toxin production and pathogen virulence in leaves of susceptible varieties.",

        "abstract": "The clpks18 gene was first cloned and identified in Curvularia lunata. It contains 6571 base pairs (bp) and an 6276 bp open reading frame encoding 2091 amino acids. The ClPKS18 deletion mutant displayed an albino phenotype, and almost lost the ability to product 5-(hydroxymethyl) furan-2-carboxylate (M5HF2C) toxin, implying that clpks18 gene in C. lunata is not only involved in 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene melanin synthesis, but also relatively associated with M5HF2C toxin biosynthesis of the pathogen. The pathogenicity assays revealed that ΔClPKS18 was impaired in colonizing the maize leaves, which corresponds to the finding that ClPKS18 controls the production of melanin and M5HF2C in C. lunata. Results indicate that ClPKS18 plays a vital role in regulating pathogenicity of in C. lunata.",

        "abstract": "Dichlorvos (DDVP) is widely applied in the agricultural industry, and its residues are considered hazardous to the environment. Microbial bioremediation is an innovative technology with the potential to mitigate such pollution. Trichoderma atroviride strain T23, a filamentous fungus, is very efficient at degrading DDVP. Therefore, we used DDVP as a model organophosphate pesticide to study the mechanism by which Trichoderma degrades organophosphate pesticides, with the aim of attaining a global understanding of the molecular mechanism of enzymatic degradation of organophosphate pesticides by beneficial fungi. DDVP can be biodegraded via two routes, and the primary one involves hydrolysis of the P-O bond, which can result in the production of the novel degradation intermediate trichloroethanol. TaPon1-like showed continuously high expression during 120 h, and deletion of the gene decreased the efficiency of P-O bond hydrolysis. The enzyme produced by TaPon1-like had a low K for DDVP (0.23 mM) and a high k (204.3 s). The enzyme was able to hydrolyze broad substrates such as organophosphate oxons and lactone and maintain stable activity in a wide range of pH and temperature values. The TaPon1-like hydrolase played an important role in the first step of DDVP degradation by strain T23 and contributed to a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of organophosphate pesticide degradation.",

Methods Female Wistar rats (n = 28) after pregenancy were randomly divided into control group,hypothyroid group and iodine deficient group. According to the dose of PTU in fed water,hypothyroid group was divided into 5ppm group and 15ppm group ( 7 in each ). 5 pups from each group were sacrificed and perfused intracardially in postnatal day (PN) 7,PN14,PN21,PN28 and PN42. Brains were removed,fixed and sectioned coronally. All sections were observated and analysed the protein exression of ERK1 /2 by immunohistochemistry in the entorhinal cortex. Results In PN14, PN21,PN28 and PN42,protein levels of ERK1 /2 in the entorhinal cortex in iodine-deficient,5ppm and 15ppm treatment groups were significantly lower than those of controls (P < 0. 05). In PN7,the protein expression was no significantly difference in all four groups.

Our main contributions include Bode and Poisson type integral inequalities for the sensitivity and complementary sensitivity functions, together with bounds on the sensitivity and complementary sensitivity magnitudes, which are obtained for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. Part I presents Bode type integral inequalities. These inequalities may be viewed as some variants to the previously available results, but are also significantly different. The main difference is two fold. First, while the previous integral equalities are valid only under a restrictive assumption, the results herein hold in general. Secondly, in spite of the fact that the present results are based upon techniques and assumptions similar to those used in deriving Bode type integral inequalities, the in-depth study carried out here leads to more explicable expressions particularly indicative of the adverse effects of open loop unstable poles. As a direct outcome, the new results confirm that in a multivariable system design limitation and tradeoff depends on both the locations and directions of open loop unstable poles, and in particular, in how such directions may be aligned. The latter is characterized by angles measuring the mutual orientation between the pole directions",

        "abstract": "1,3-β-glucan is considered a fungal biomarker and exposure to this agent can induce lung inflammation. Complement activation plays an important role in early immune responses to β-glucan. Previous studies showed that T-regulatory cells (Tregs) regulated 1,3-β-glucan-induced lung inflammation by modulating the maintenance of immune homeostasis in the lung. Both interleukin (IL)-17 and TH17 cells play pivotal roles in inflammation associated with lung disease and share reciprocal developmental pathways with Tregs. However, the effect of Tregs on IL-17 and TH17 responses in 1,3-β-glucan- induced lung inflammation remains unclear. In this study, mice were exposed to 1,3-β-glucan by intratracheal instillation. To investigate the effects of Tregs on IL-17 and TH17 cells in the induced lung inflammation, a Treg-depleted mice model was generated by administration of anti-CD25 mAb. The results indicated that Treg-depleted mice showed more severe pathological inflammatory changes in lung tissues. Tregs depletion reduced IL-17 expression in these tissues, and increased those of TH1 cytokines. The expression of IL-17 increased at the early phase of the inflammation response. There were no significant effects of the Tregs on expression of RORγt and IL-6 or the amount of CD4+IL-17+ cells in the lungs. When taken together, the late phase of the 1,3-β-glucan-induced inflammatory response in the mice was primarily mediated by TH1 cytokines rather than IL-17. In contrast, the early phase of the inflammatory response might be mediated in part by IL-17 along with activated complement. Tregs might be required for IL-17 expression during the late phase inflammatory response in mice. The increased IL-17 mRNA observed during the 1,3-β-glucan induced inflammatory response were attributed to cells other than TH17 cells. © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Biological control of plant diseases is an effective method with the beneficial microorganisms or microbial metabolites against crop diseases.Streptomyces are already identified to produce a range of antibiotics including natamycin etc.,which exhibit an excellent activities against fungal pathogens.Streptomyces lydicus A01 has been proved as a biocontrol microbe with antagonistic activity against Botrytis cinerea by producing natamycin,which degrading the cell membrane of fungal pathogens.Natamycin,a polyene macrolide antibiotic with broad-spectrum antifungal activity,has a stable and strong inhibitory activity against many plant pathogenic fungi,and is commonly used as antifungal agent.Chitinase can degrade chitin and could be used for resist many fungal pathogens.In A01-chit33CT,natamycin was produced to inhibit plant pathogens via destructing fungal cell membrane,while chit33 plays an important role in hydrolyzing the chitin component in fungal pathogen cell wall.The coordination effect of natamycin and chit33 may be improved significantly. The optimal fermentation conditions for chitinase activity and natamycin produced in Streptomyces lydicus A01-chit33CT were studied.Firstly,the effect of different carbon and nitrogen sources on natamycin production and chitinase activities were investigated.The results showed that: glucose can promote natamycin production but inhibit the expression of chit33,so glucose and chitin powder were added into the fermentation medium with two-stage method to achieve collaborative expressions of both.The optimal medium compositions were as follow: chitin powder 10 g/L(after 4 days),glucose 40 g/L,soybean meal 30 g/L,soya peptone 10 g/L,CaCO3 5g/L,MgSO4·7H2O 0.5g/L,K2HPO4 0.5 g/L.Secondly,the cultural conditions were further to optimum as follows: initial pH 6.0,temperature 28℃,rotation speed 180 r/min.The highest natamycin production could reach 1.52 g/L and chitinase activity reach 990U/ml under the optimal fermentation conditions.Both levels improved by 1.95 and 2.27 times at post-optimazation compared to that of pre-optimization,respectively.",

        "abstract": "This paper is the first report of the impact on the bacterial community in the midgut of the Asian corn borer (Ostrinia furnacalis) by the chitinase from the transgenic Trichoderma strain. In this study, we detected a change of the bacterial community in the midgut of the fourth instar larvae by using a culture-independent method. Results suggested that Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the most highly represented phyla, being present in all the midgut bacterial communities. The observed species richness was simple, ranging from four to five of all the 16S rRNA clone libraries. When using Trichoderma fermentation liquids as additives, the percentages of the dominant flora in the total bacterial community in larval midgut changed significantly. The community of the genus Ochrobactrum in the midgut decreased significantly when the larvae were fed with the fermentation liquids of the transgenic Trichoderma strain Mc4. However, the Enterococcus community increased and then occupied the vacated niche of the Ochrobactrum members. Furthermore, the Shannon-Wiener (H) and the Simpson (1-D) indexes of the larval midgut bacterial library treated by feeding fermentation liquids of the transgenic Trichoderma strain Mc4 was the lowest compared with the culture medium, fermentation liquids of the wild type strain T30, and the sterile artificial diet. The Enterococcus sp. strain was isolated and characterized from the healthy larvae midgut of the Asian corn borer. An infection study of the Asian corn borer larvae using Enterococcus sp. ACB-1 revealed that a correlation existed between the increased Enterococcus community in the larval midgut and larval mortality. These results demonstrated that the transgenic Trichoderma strain could affect the composition of the midgut bacterial community. The change of the midgut bacterial community might be viewed as one of the factors resulting in the increased mortality of the Asian corn borer larvae.",

        "abstract": "Occupational exposure to crystalline silica (CS) results in a persistent pulmonary inflammatory response that eventually leads to abnormal tissue repair, disability, and death. The inflammatory-immune responses occur in the early stages of CS exposure, and both innate and adaptive immunity are involved. CD4+ T cells play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of CS-induced pulmonary disease, which has no proven curative therapy. Dihydrotanshinone I (DHI), a natural product isolated from Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Danshen), has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. However, whether DHI has a protective effect on CS-induced lung disease, how it influences the Th immune response, and the potential underlying molecular mechanism(s) have not been fully clarified. In this study, DHI treatment of CS-exposed mice reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and the infiltration of immune cells. It significantly ameliorated CS-induced pulmonary inflammation by attenuating T helper (Th)1 and Th17 responses, which were tightly related to the inhibition of STAT1 and STAT3. DHI significantly altered Th2 cytokines but not the Th2 nuclear transcription factor. Furthermore, our study found that DHI treatment also affected regulatory T cell activity in CS-injured mice. Taken together, our findings indicated that DHI could modulate Th responses and alleviate CS-induced pulmonary inflammation, suggesting a novel application of DHI in CS-induced pulmonary disease.",

        "abstract": "Though HLA-DP/DQ is regarded to associate with HBV susceptibility and HBV natural clearance, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development is obscure. And the role of STAT4 in HBV susceptibility and clearance as well as HCC development is still contentious. Therefore, we conducted this study, aiming to clarify these obscure relationships.We recruited 1312 Chinese Han subjects including healthy controls, HBV carriers and HCC patients in the experiment stage. The meta-analysis included 3467 HCC patients and 5821 HBV carriers to appraise the association with HCC development.Consistent with previous studies, HLA-DP/DQ associated with HBV susceptibility and HBV natural clearance (p<0.05). However, the experiment showed that HLA-DP rs3077, rs9277535 and rs7453920 did not associate with HCC development (dominant model, rs3077, OR = 0.86, 95%CI = 0.62-1.18; rs9277535, OR = 0.94, 95%CI = 0.68-1.30; rs7453920, OR = 0.75, 95%CI = 0.44-1.27). Meta-analysis again consolidated this conclusion (allele model, rs3077, OR = 0.94, 95%CI = 0.87-1.02; rs9277535, OR = 1.04, 95%CI = 0.97-1.11; rs7453920, OR = 0.89, 95%CI = 0.76-1.02). As for STAT4 rs7574865, we did not find any significant association with HBV susceptibility (OR = 0.91, 95%CI = 0.66-1.26) or HBV natural clearance (OR = 1.13, 95%CI = 0.86-1.49). Moreover, current data failed to acquire positive connection of rs7574865 with HCC development (experiment, OR = 0.86, 95%CI = 0.62-1.19; meta-analysis, OR = 0.87, 95%CI = 0.74-1.03), which may be due to the small sample size.HLA-DP/DQ polymorphisms (rs3077, rs9277535, rs7453920) did not associate with HCC development, but did correlate with HBV susceptibility and HBV natural clearance. STAT4 rs7574865 seemed not to correlate with HBV susceptibility or natural clearance. And it seemed rather ambiguous in its role on HCC development at present.",

        "abstract": "This study compares the effect of nanosized silicon dioxide (nanosized SiO2) and microsized silicon dioxide (microsized SiO2) particles on fibrogenesis in rats. Wistar rats were instilled intratracheally with saline, 20 mg of nanosized SiO2 or 20 mg of microsized SiO2, and were sacrificed at 1 and 2 months after instillation. The lungs of rats were analysed for the changes of lung/body coefficient and hydroxyproline content. Changes in pathology and fibrotic grade were observed by use of hematoxylin and eosin and Van Gieson dyeing. The expression of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) was observed by use of immunohistochemical technique, and protein expression quantitatively analysed by image analysis. The lung/body coefficient and hydroxyproline content of nanosized SiO2 groups were significantly lower than those of microsized SiO2 groups at both 1 and 2 months after instillation (P<0.05 or P<0.01), but without significant differences from those of saline control groups. At 1 month after instillation, there were mainly cellular nodules (Stage I) in nanosized SiO2 group, while in microsized SiO2 group Stage II, II+ of silicotic nodules were observed. At 2 months after instillation, there were still Stage I of silicotic nodules in nanosized SiO2 group. In microsized SiO2 group mainly Stage II+, III of silicotic nodules were found. Quantity image analysis showed that the expressions of IL-4 and TGF-beta1 in nanosized SiO2 groups were significantly lower than those in microsized SiO2 groups (P<0.01), but without significant difference from those of saline control groups. Our experiment revealed that the effect of fibrogenesis of nanosized SiO2 might be milder than that of microsized SiO2 in rats, potentially resulting from nanoparticals tending to be diffused and easily translocated due to their ultrafine particle size compared to microsized particles.",

        "abstract": "CD36, a cell surface receptor for thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), is believed to interact with latent transforming growth factor-beta1 (L-TGF-beta1) thereby activating its fibrogenic bioactivity. In this study, a lentiviral vector expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting the rat CD36 gene (Lv-shCD36) is developed and tested. To observe the inhibitory effect of Lv-shCD36 on the activation of L-TGF-beta1, a rat alveolar macrophage cell line (NR8383), infected with either Lv-shCD36 or Lv-shCD36-NC (non-silenced control lentivirus), was treated with 0.1 microg/ml bleomycin, which is known to stimulate alveolar macrophages to release increasing amounts of TGF-beta1. The results show that Lv-shCD36 can suppress expression of CD36 mRNA and protein in bleomycin-treated NR8383 cells. By quantifying active and total TGF-beta1 in the supernatant, it was discovered that the quantity of total TGF-beta1 is not significantly different between the three groups, while the quantity and percent of active TGF-beta1 in the Lv-shCD36 group was significantly lower than in either the bleomycin-treated group or the Lv-shCD36-NC group, respectively (P < 0.05). These results suggest that Lv-shCD36 can inhibit activation of L-TGF-beta1 secreted in bleomycin-treated NR8383 cells by decreasing the expression of CD36 on the cell membrane, thereby reducing binding of CD36 to TSP-1.",

        "abstract": "Electromigration (EM) is a major concern for very large-scale integration (VLSI) interconnect reliability, particularly for interconnect trees with multibranch metal wires representing continuously connected metal (Cu) lines terminated at diffusion barriers. For EM modeling and assessment, one important problem is to perform fast EM time to failure analysis for practical VLSI chips. Compact modeling for EM effects for the interconnect tree has been studied recently to better EM signoff analysis. But the existing method cannot consider wires stressed under time-varying temperature, which is very typical for practical chip working conditions. In this paper, we develop the exact analytic model for the stress evolution of interconnect trees under different current density and varying segment length from the first principle. Due to the difficulty in obtaining the exact analytical solution, we focus on three-terminal wire in this paper. The stress evolution is modeled by two Korhonen’s equations coupled through boundary conditions which are solved with the Laplace transformation technique. The new analytical EM model is further extended to consider the time-varying temperature stressing condition and initial non-zero residual stress. The proposed method is compared with the finite-element method (FEM) tool COMSOL, the recently proposed eigenfunction-based method, and the published EM simulator XSim. The comparison shows that the analytical solution agrees well with the results from the FEM numerical analysis. It uses much fewer terms compared to the eigenfunction method for the same accuracy. It also agrees very well with XSim, which is consistent with the previously reported measured results.",

        "abstract": "ATPM [(-)-3-amino-thiazolo[5,4-b]-N-cyclopropylmethylmorphinan hydrochloride] was found to have mixed kappa- and mu-opioid activity and identified to act as a full kappa-agonist and a partial mu-agonist by in vitro binding assays. The present study was undertaken to characterize its in vivo effects on morphine antinociceptive tolerance in mice and heroin self-administration in rats. ATPM was demonstrated to yield more potent antinociceptive effects than (-)U50,488H (trans-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]benzeneacetamide). It was further found that the antinociceptive effects of ATPM were mediated by kappa- and mu-, but not delta-opioid, receptors. In addition to its agonist profile on the mu-receptor, ATPM also acted as a mu-antagonist, as measured by its inhibition of morphine-induced antinociception. It is more important that ATPM had a greater ratio of the ED(50) value of sedation to that of antinociception than (-)U50,488 (11.8 versus 3.7), indicative of a less sedative effect than (-)U50,488H. In addition, ATPM showed less potential to develop antinociceptive tolerance relative to (-)U50,488H and morphine. Moreover, it dose-dependently inhibited morphine-induced antinociceptive tolerance. Furthermore, it was found that chronic treatment of rats for 8 consecutive days with ATPM (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) produced sustained decreases in heroin self-administration. (-)U50,488H (2 mg/kg s.c.) also produced similar inhibitory effect. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that ATPM, a novel mixed kappa-agonist and mu-agonist/-antagonist, could inhibit morphine-induced antinociceptive tolerance, with less potential to develop tolerance and reduce heroin self-administration with less sedative effect. kappa-Agonists with some mu-activity appear to offer some advantages over selective kappa-agonists for the treatment of heroin abuse.",

Both the concentration and spatial heterogeneity of soil nutrition,especially the content of nitrogen and phosphorus,affected the infection ability of this pathogen.High fertilization of nitrogen and phosphorus could improve the resistance of maize to GLS.Light intensity had no significant influence on the infection of GLS.But GLS tended to prevail under environmental light-dark alternation.The different growth stages of maize have different influences on pathogen infection.The pathogen tended to infect plants at the stage of 11-12 leaves.",

        "abstract": "Information processing with ℓ1-norm constraint has been a topic of considerable interest during the last five years since it produces sparse solutions. Non-negativity constraints are also desired properties that can usually be imposed due to inherent physical characteristics of real-life phenomena. In this paper, we investigate an online method for system identification subject to these two families of constraints. Our approach differs from existing techniques such as projected-gradient algorithms in that it does not require any extra projection onto the feasible region. The mean weight-error behavior is analyzed analytically. Experimental results show the advantage of our approach over some existing algorithms. Finally, an application to hyperspectral data processing is considered.",

        "abstract": "Objective To determine the effect of cobalt chloride(CoCl2) post-conditioning on the spatial working memory in neonatal rats with hypoxic-ischemic induced brain damage(HIBD).Methods Sixty-six SD rats aged 7 d were randomly divided into sham operation group(N,n=16),hypoxia-ischemia group(HI,n=18),CoCl2 administration immediately after surgery group(C1,n=14) and CoCl2 administration 1 d after surgery group(C2,n=18).The left common carotid artery of rats were ligated after anesthesia followed by hypoxia.In the sham control group,the left common carotid artery was exposed but was not ligated or exposed to hypoxia.The brain tissues were harvested from the pups in each group at 1,2 and 7 d after ligation.HIF-1α expression was detected by Western blot analysis.At age of 7 weeks,pups of each group were trained to do the Morris water maze test to evaluate their spatial learning and memory abilities.Results HIF-1α expression was up-regulated in HI,C1 and C2 groups at post operation days 1 and 2,then decreased,and even not detectable in the former 2 groups at postoperative day 7,but detectable in C2 group.Morris water maze training revealed that the rats in C2 group had significantly shortened average latency time at 3 to 5 d,and improved long-term reference memory compared with that in HI group(P<0.05).Conclusion CoCl2 improves and maintains the expression of HIF-1α in newborn rats after hypoxic-ischemic induced brain damage.Post-conditioning with CoCl2 at 1 d after hypoxic-ischemic damage exerts neuroprotection and restores spatial working memory.",

However, the prognostic value of platelet counts and the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) has not been investigated in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to determine the prognostic value of platelet counts and PLR in HCC patients. A total of 243 ethnic Chinese advanced HCC patients from two major hospitals, not receiving systemic sorafenib, were analyzed retrospectively. The prognostic value of differential blood cell counts and PLR for overall survival (OS) was determined by integrating the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score system and model for end-stage liver disease by using a stepwise model of multivariate Cox regression. The Kaplan-Meier method and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized accordingly. PLR was confirmed to be an independent predictor for OS (p < 0.01), while the remaining parameters had no predictive value. Then, advanced HCC patients were dichotomized into two groups based on the PLR value (≤111.23 or >111.23), according to ROC analysis. Patients with a high PLR had a lower 3-month survival rate (37.6 vs. 57.6%) compared with patients with a low PLR. PLR was associated with aggressive malignant behavior, characterized by distant metastasis and portal vein thrombosis. Additionally, PLR was not associated with the CLIP score and Child-Pugh grade. PLR was identified as an independent prognostic factor for advanced HCC patients not receiving systemic sorafenib; the predictive ability of PLR partially relies on its association with the aggressive nature of HCC.",

        "abstract": "Previously, a significantly upregulated lncRNA, LINC01512, in lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) was obtained, while its biological function and molecular mechanisms were unclear. The expression level of LINC01512 was estimated by qPCR from 100 pairs of LAD and NT samples. The correlation of LINC01512 to clinical data of LAD patients was analyzed. LINC01512 was knocked down and overexpressed in SPCA-1 and A549 cell lines by lentivirus-mediated technology, and the oncological behavioral changes of SPCA-1 and A549 cells were observed, as well as, tumorigenicity in experimental nude mice. Compared to the adjacent tissues, LINC01512 was obviously upregulated in LAD. The expression level of LINC01512 was closely related to lymph node metastasis and tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage. Survival analysis showed that the survival time of high expression LINC01512 group was significantly shorter than the low-expression group in LAD. Knockdown or overexpression test unanimously confirmed that LINC01512 can increase the ability of cell migration, invasion, proliferation, colony formation, adhesion, and S phase and G2/M phase cells, whereas decrease the apoptosis and G0/G1 phase cells. Nude mice experiments confirmed that LINC01512 significantly enhanced the speed and weight of tumorigenicity. LINC01512 is an oncogenic lncRNA gene that promotes the progression and distinctly enhances the oncogenic ability in lung adenocarcinoma. J. Cell. Biochem. 118: 3102-3110, 2017. © 2017 The Authors.

        "abstract": "In the present study, we made further investigation into the diversity of Trichoderma in China than previous ones utilizing comprehensive approaches of morphological microscopic observation and phylogenetic analysis by detecting molecular markers. One thousand nine hundred ten Trichoderma strains were isolated from soil or other materials in China: East (Anhui, Fujian, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shandong, Zhejiang province and Shanghai municipality), South-West (Guizhou, Qinghai, Shanxi, Sichuan and Yunnan province, Tibet Autonomous Region and Chongqing municipality), South-East (Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan province), and Middle China (Henan, Hubei and Hunan province). Representative isolates were verified at the species level by morphological characters and the oligonucleotide barcode program TrichoOKey v.10 and the custom BLAST server TrichoBLAST, using sequence of the ITS 1 and 2 region of the rDNA cluster and partial sequences of translation elongation factor 1-alpha(tef1-α). A total of 23 Trichoderma species were identified : T.asperellum, T.atrioviride, T.aureovriride, T.brevicompactum, T.citrioviride, T.erinaceum, T.gamsii, T.hamatum, T.harzianum (H.1ixii), T.intricatum, T.koningii (H.koningii), T.koningiopsis, T.longibranchiatum, T.pleuroticola, T.reeseii (H.jecorina), T.sinensis, T.spirale, T.stromaticum, T.tomentosum, T.velutinum, T.vermipilum, T.virens (H.virens), T.viride. Among them, 3 species: T.intricatum, T.stromaticum, T.vermipilum were first reported in China; T.harzianum (H,1ixii) was the most widely distributed species in China. This study further shows that, the highest biodiversity of Trichoderma population appeared in South-West China.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we compared the accuracy of marker evaluation in core needle biopsy (CNB) specimens versus excision specimens (ESs) from breast cancer patients. This retrospective study used data collected from the breast cancer database at the West China Hospital, China. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results from CNB specimens and ESs were compared, using estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and Ki-67 as markers. Molecular subtyping and endocrine therapy usage correlations based on CNB samples and ESs were evaluated. The results obtained from CNB samples and ESs exhibited substantial agreement for the detection of ER (κ = 0.522), PR (κ = 0.441), and HER2 (κ = 0.451), and also influenced endocrine therapy usage. Fair and poor correlations were observed for Ki-67 staining and molecular subtyping (κ = 0.195), respectively. This disagreement might be attributable to a combination of heterogeneity and large tumor size. This study indicates that the discordance rate in molecular marker staining between CNB specimens and ESs is significant enough that results obtained with CNB specimens should be used cautiously or verified using ESs.",

        "abstract": "Neurotoxicity of iodine deficiency-induced hypothyroidism during developmental period results in serious impairments of brain function, such as learning and memory. These impairments are largely irreversible, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In addition to hypothyroidism, iodine deficiency may cause hypothyroxinemia, a relatively subtle form of thyroid hormone deficiency. Neurotoxicity of developmental hypothyroxinemia also potentially impairs learning and memory. However, more direct evidence of the associations between developmental hypothyroxinemia and impairments of learning and memory should be provided, and the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the effects of developmental hypothyroxinemia and hypothyroidism on long-term potentiation (LTP), a widely accepted cellular model of learning and memory, in the hippocampal CA1 region. The activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway - a pathway closely associated with synaptic plasticity and learning and memory - was also investigated. Wistar rats were treated with iodine deficient diet or methimazole (MMZ) to induce developmental hypothyroxinemia or hypothyroidism. The results showed that developmental hypothyroxinemia caused by mild iodine deficiency and developmental hypothyroidism caused by severe iodine deficiency or MMZ significantly reduced the field-excitatory postsynaptic potential (f-EPSP) slope and the population spike (PS) amplitude. Decreased activation of the PI3K signaling pathway was also observed in rats subjected to developmental hypothyroxinemia or hypothyroidism. Our results may support the hypothesis that neurotoxicity of both developmental hypothyroxinemia and hypothyroidism causes damages to learning and memory. Our results also suggest that decreased activation of the PI3K signaling pathway may contribute to impairments of LTP caused by neurotoxicity of both developmental hypothyroxinemia and hypothyroidism.",

Itu0027s an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events. Since the pathogenesis of VC is complicated, current therapies have limited effects on the regression of VC. Therefore, it is urgent to investigate the potential mechanisms and find new targets for the treatment of VC. Aldosterone (Aldo), a mineralocorticoid hormone, is the metabolite of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation, which can exert genomic and non-genomic effects on the cardiovascular system. Recent data suggests that Aldo can promote VC. Here, we summarized the roles of Aldo in the process of VC and a series of findings indicated that Aldo could act as a potentially therapeutic target for treating VC.",

The bounds are derived for control systems with linear time-invariant plants and causal stabilizing controllers communicating over noisy communication channels. We utilize the notion of power gain to measure the worst case power reduction from the disturbance to the error signal. Concepts from information theory, such as entropy and mutual information, are instrumental in the analysis, and the performance bounds can be quantified explicitly in terms of the channel blurredness and the plant unstable dynamics.",

We consider an H∞-identification problem for a class of linear shift invariant multi-input/multi-output systems. Our main results are an interpolatory algorithm and a number of bounds on the identification error. This algorithm operates on available input and output data in the time domain and is constructed by solving an extended matrix tangential Caratheodory-Fejer problem. Similar to its counterpart for scalar systems, this interpolatory algorithm possesses certain desirable optimality properties and can be obtained via standard convex programming methods",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the effect of vitamin A, vitamin A plus iron and \"7 + 1\" multiple micronutrient-fortified seasoning powder on iron metabolic homeostasis in preschool children.This was a randomized, controlled and blinded interventional field trial. A total of 226 2 - 7 years old preschool children were recruited from three nurseries in the area, and they were randomly assigned into three different fortified diet groups for 6 months. The subjects in Group I were fortified with vitamin A; those in Group II and III were fortified with vitamin A plus iron and vitamin A plus iron, thiamine, riboflavin, folic acid, niacinamide, zinc and calcium (7 + 1), respectively. The concentration of serum vitamin A was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), serum ferritin (SF) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) was measured by microparticle-enhanced, and hemoglobin (HB) by hemiglobincyanide, the sTfR-SF index (TFR-F index) and total body iron content were computed respectively before and after intervention. Simultaneously, children's demographic data, socio-economic status and eating habits, etc. were investigated by questionnaires.A total of 226 preschool children were included in the study with age ranged from 2 to 7 years with average age (4.0 ± 0.85) (means ± standard deviation). The prevalence of anemia, deficient iron storage, vitamin A deficiency (VAD) and suspect sub-clinical vitamin A deficiency (SSVAD) were 23.5%, 15.0%, 6.3% and 25.9%, respectively. The levels of SF and sTfR significantly decreased after intervention in all groups (χ(2) = 8.3298, χ(2) = 16.1471, χ(2) = 15.1371, χ(2) = 15.1171, χ(2) = 5.2617, χ(2) = 4.8844, P < 0.05) especially in group II and group III for SF (χ(2) = 16.1471, χ(2) = 15.1371, P < 0.05) and group I for sTfR (χ(2) = 15.1171, P < 0.05). No marked change of TFR-F index and total body iron contents was observed in group I (t = 0.1817, t = 1.7736, P > 0.05), while TFR-F index decreased and total body iron contents increased in group II and group III (t = 5.3561, t = 6.5979, t = 11.1663, t = 8.7306, P < 0.05) after intervention.Vitamin A intervention has significant effect on iron storage and mobilization but seldom effect on iron absorption in small intestine. The combination of vitamin A and other micronutrients might be a better intervention for the improvement of iron deficiency for preschool-children.",

        "abstract": "Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) was applied in Trichoderma atroviride strain T23. Meanwhile, the transformation method was optimized by adjusting the concentration of hygromycin B in selection medium and exploring the incubation time of Agrobacterial AGL-1 cells. The transformation efficiency was about 50 transformants per 107 conidia. All transformants were successively subcultured for five generations, and then screened on selective plates, 118 genetically stable transformants were obtained. Some of them were randomly selected to conduct PCR and Southern blotting analysis, and the result showed that all transformants tested were arbitrarily integrated with exogenous T-DNA in genome. Compared to wild-type strain T23, three transformants were obviously different in spore production and mycelia growth rate. The successful application of ATMT technique in T. atroviride T23 will facilitate the study of functional genome of this organism.",

        "abstract": "Silica dust mainly attacks alveolar macrophages (AMs) and increases the apoptosis of AMs in silicosis patients. However, it is still unclear whether autophagy is affected. Autophagy mainly has defensive functions in response to stress, contributing to cell survival in adverse conditions, and conversely it has also been implicated in cell death. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is able to induce autophagy and apoptosis in macrophages. The role of LPS in autophagy and apoptosis in AMs of silicosis patients is unknown. In this study, we collected AMs from 53 male workers exposed to silica and divided them into an observer (control) group, and stage I, II and III patient groups. We found increased levels of LC3B, SQSTM1/p62 and BECN1, whereas the phosphorylation of MTOR, and levels of LAMP2, TLR4, MYD88, TICAM1, as well as the number of lysosomes decreased with the development of silicosis. LPS stimulation triggered autophagy and increased levels of SQSTM1 in AMs. The autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3MA), inhibited LPS-induced apoptosis in the AMs of silicosis patients. Moreover, 3 MA reversed the LPS-induced decrease in BCL2 and the increase in BAX and CASP3 levels in AMs. These results suggest that autophagosomes accumulate in AMs during silicosis progression. LPS can induce the formation of autophagosomes through a TLR4-dependent pathway, and LPS may exacerbate the apoptosis in AMs. Blockade of the formation of autophagosomes may inhibit LPS-induced apoptosis via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in AMs. These findings describe novel mechanisms that may lead to new preventive and therapeutic strategies for pulmonary fibrosis.",

        "abstract": "Epidemiological evidence on the associations between urinary di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) metabolites and residential characteristics is limited. Therefore, we investigated the associations of urinary DEHP metabolites with the residential characteristics of pregnant women. We collected completed questionnaires and maternal spot urine samples from 616 random pregnant women in Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University in Shenyang. Urinary DEHP metabolites concentrations, including mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) and mono (2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), were measured and analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Multivariable linear regression models were performed to obtain regression estimates (β) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics. In all participants, the geometric mean of MEHP and MEHHP concentrations were 4.25 ± 4.34 and 5.72 ± 2.65 μg/L, respectively. In multivariable analyses after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, distance from residence to motor vehicle traffic (≥150 m versus <20 m) was negatively associated with MEHP (β = -0.241, 95% CI: -0.448, -0.033) and MEHHP (β = -0.279, 95% CI: -0.418, -0.140) concentrations. Compared with the one that had not recently been renovated, a renovated home was associated with higher MEHP (β = 0.194, 95% CI: 0.064, 0.324) and MEHHP (β = 0.111, 95% CI: 0.024, 0.197) concentrations. Air freshener use was associated with higher MEHP (β = 0.322, 95% CI: 0.007, 0.636) concentrations. Moldy walls were positively associated with MEHP (β = 0.299, 95% CI: 0.115, 0.482) and MEHHP (β = 0.172, 95% CI: 0.050, 0.294) concentrations. In contrast, humidifier use was associated with a lower MEHP concentration (β = -0.167, 95% CI: -0.302, -0.032). Residential characteristics were probably associated with the DEHP exposure of pregnant women in Shenyang. Living near the motor vehicle traffic, residential renovation, air freshener use, and moldy walls are likely risk factors for increased DEHP exposure, whereas using household humidifier could be considered a protective measure to reduce DEHP exposure.",

        "abstract": "Circular RNAs have recently been disclosed as potential biomarkers for human cancers. This study aimed to characterize the expression and function of a novel circular RNA, circCDK13, in liver cancer progression, as well as to elucide the underlying mechanisms. For this purpose, circCDK13 expression was quantitatively analyzed by RT-PCR in various liver cancer cell lines and human cancerous tissues. The migration, cell cycle progression, proliferation and invasion of liver cancer cells with an enhanced circCDK13 expression were evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) assay, flow cytometry and the Transwell culture system. Microarray and western blot analyses were performed to explore the underlying signaling mechanisms. The role of circCDK13 in liver cancer was finally examined by tumorigenicity assay using nude mice. The results revealed that circCDK13 expression was suppressed in various liver cancer lines and tissue samples from patients with liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). The induced overexpression of circCDK13 in the liver cancer cells markedly inhibited their migration rates, altered cell cycle progression, and suppressed the cell migratory and invasive capacities. Microarray analysis also identified numerous downstream genes regulated by circCDK13, particularly those in the Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathways. The results of the tumorigenicity assay revealed that circCDK13 overexpression significantly inhibited liver cancer progression in nude mice. On the whole, the findings of this study indicate that circCDK13 is a novel circular RNA that suppresses liver cancer progression, and that these suppressive effects are possibly mediated via the JAK/STAT and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways.",

This laser can be constructed by spin coating a solution of polydimethylsiloxane doped with the rhodamine 6G organic dye and silver nanowires onto a silicone rubber slab. The excellent overlap of the plasmon resonance peak of the silver nanowires with both the pump wavelength and the photoluminescence spectrum provides the low threshold and tuning properties of the random laser. The random laser wavelength can be tuned from 558 to 565 nm by stretching the soft substrate, which causes reorientation and breakage of the silver nanowires. The polarization state of the random laser can also be changed from random polarization to partial polarization by stretching. The laser performance remains unchanged after the stretching and restoration experiments. These results not only enable easy realization of an ultrathin flexible plasmonic random laser but also provide insights into the mechanisms of three-dimensional plasmonic feedback random lasers.",

        "abstract": "Due to the inherent physical characteristics of systems under investigation, non-negativity is one of the most interesting constraints that can usually be imposed on the parameters to estimate. The Non-Negative Least-Mean-Square algorithm (NNLMS) was proposed to adaptively find solutions of a typical Wiener filtering problem but with the side constraint that the resulting weights need to be non-negative. It has been shown to have good convergence properties. Nevertheless, certain practical applications may benefit from the use of modified versions of this algorithm. In this paper, we derive three variants of NNLMS. Each variant aims at improving the NNLMS performance regarding one of the following aspects: sensitivity of input power, unbalance of convergence rates for different weights and computational cost. We study the stochastic behavior of the adaptive weights for these three new algorithms for non-stationary environments. This study leads to analytical models to predict the first and second order moment behaviors of the weights for Gaussian inputs. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the new algorithms and the accuracy of the derived models.",

        "abstract": "Previous study showed that a linkage drag between a blast resistance gene Pi25 (t) and QTLs conditioning spikelet fertility ( qSF-6) and number of filled grains per panicle ( qNFGP-6 ) was detected on the short arm of chromosome 6. A larger population was used for further verification, and the results confirmed the linkage drag between the blast resistance gene and QTL conditioning spikelet fertility, other than QTL conditioning number of filled grains per panicle. Breakdown or avoidance of the linkage drag could be achieved by selection against the genotype background of a heading-date gene ( qHD-7 ) that resided in the region between RM2 and RM214 on chromosome 7. For further validation, two lines with almost identical genotypes on all chromosomal regions except the Pi25 (t) region on chromosome 6 were chosen to develop a new population. The results showed that qSF-6 could be further subdivided into qSF-6-1 and qSF-6-2 . When the genotype of the region between RM2 and RM214 was from rice variety Zhong 156, the linkage drag between Pi25 (t) and qSF-6-2 was detected and the allele of qSF-6-2 from rice variety Gumei 2 reduced the spikelet fertility. When the genotype of the region between RM2 and RM214 was from Gumei 2, no linkage drag was detected. This indicates that the linkage drag between the blast resistance gene and the QTL conditioning spikelet fertility could be broken down or avoided under a certain background genotype selection against heading-date and provides a marker aided solution for high level of blast resistance and yield breeding in rice and other crops as well.",

        "abstract": "Our research estimated the economic costs of possible cases of coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP) among redeployed coal workers from the Fuxin Mining Industry Group. The study cohort included 19,116 coal workers between 1965 and 2012. We estimated direct and indirect economic costs due to possible current and future CWP cases among redeployed coal workers. We found as of 2012 that 141 possible CWP cases might have resulted in economic costs of $37.52 million ($33.84 million were direct and $3.68 million indirect). Moreover, 221 possible future CWP cases would result in economic costs of $63.89 million ($57.20 million direct and $6.69 million indirect). Neither the Fuxin Mining Industry Group nor Fuxin could cover the costs of CWP screening and diagnosis, or social security payments for redeployed coal workers. We suggest that China's national government help Liaoning Province and Fuxin focus on health care and social security.",

Chitosan (CS) was coated first on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, followed by acrylic acid attaching on the CS magnetic microspheres and then polymerizing in situ. The CS-PAAc magnetic microspheres were obtained after crosslinking by glutaraldehyde. The physicochemical properties of prepared CS-PAAc magnetic microspheres were investigated by FT-IR, scanning electron microscope (SEM), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), element analysis, vibrating-sample magnetometer (VSM), and laser particle analyzer (LSD). The result shows that the prepared CS-PAAc magnetic microspheres possess a good sphericity with an average diameter of 500 nm and have a superparamagnetic property with the saturation magnetization of 45 emu·g-1. The quantity of Fe3O4 in the prepared CS-PAAc magnetic microspheres is about 73 %(wt). The effect of pH on swelling ratio of the prepared CS-PAAc magnetic microspheres was studied. It was found that the prepared CS-PAAc magnetic microspheres show good pH-sensitivity; and its smallest swelling ratio is at pH=3.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the prognostic value of preoperative lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing curative hepatectomy.Clinicopathological data of 210 hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated HCC patients who were treated by radical hepatic resection between 2003 and 2010 were retrospectively analyzed. None of the patients received any preoperative anticancer therapy or intraoperative radiofrequency ablation. The diagnosis was confirmed by pathological examination after surgery. Absolute peripheral blood lymphocyte and monocyte counts were derived from serum complete blood cell count before surgery, and LMR was calculated by dividing lymphocyte count by monocyte count. The best cutoff was determined by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis. Correlations between LMR levels and clinicopathological features were assessed using the χ(2) test. Survival outcomes were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the prognostic impact of LMR and other clinicopathological factors on overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS), using the Cox proportional hazards model.The optimal cutoff value of LMR for survival analysis was 3.23, which resulted in the most appropriate sensitivity of 55.3% and specificity of 74.7%, with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.66 (95%CI: 0.593-0.725). All patients were dichotomized into either a low (≤ 3.23) LMR group (n = 66) or a high (> 3.23) LMR group (n = 144). A low preoperative LMR level was significantly correlated with the presence of cirrhosis, elevated levels of total bilirubin and larger tumor size. Patients with a low LMR level had significantly reduced 5-year OS (61.9% vs 83.2%, P < 0.001) and RFS (27.8% vs 47.6%, P = 0.009) compared to those with a high LMR level. Multivariate analyses indicated that a lower LMR level was a significantly independent predictor of inferior OS (P = 0.003) and RFS (P = 0.006). Subgroup analysis indicated that survival outcome was significantly more favorable in cirrhotic patients with LMR > 3.23. However, there were no differences between low and high LMR groups for OS and RFS in non-cirrhotic patients.Preoperative LMR was demonstrated for the first time to serve as an independent prognostic factor in HBV-associated HCC patients after curative resection. Prospective studies with larger cohorts for validation are warranted.",

Two neighboring agents exchange information via a communication channel, which is modeled in this paper as an ideal transmission system subject to a multiplicative stochastic uncertainty. This uncertain channel model includes the commonly studied logarithmic quantizers and the stochastic packet dropout as special cases. For multi-agent systems with undirected connected graphs and stochastic uncertain communication channels, we derive a sufficient condition to guarantee robust consensus in the mean square sense, which unveils the fundamental limitation posed by the synchronizability factor, the topological entropy of the agents, and the mean square channel capacity. The consensus protocol based on uncertain relative state information is then designed, using the modified algebraic Riccati equation. We also consider the case where the agents are perturbed by uncertainties in the input channels. The relations between the uncertain input and communication channel models are discussed.",

        "abstract": "To understand the development of rice leaf blades, we identified a new rolled-leaf mutant, w32, from indica cultivar IR64\n through EMS mutagenesis. The mutant showed a stable rolled-leaf phenotype throughout the life cycle. Two F2 populations were developed by crossing w32 to cultivar IR24 and PA64. Genetic analysis showed that the rolled-leaf phenotype\n was controlled by a single recessive gene. To determine the location of the gene, bulked segregant analysis was carried out\n using mutant and wild-type DNA pools and 1846 mutant-type F2 individuals derived from the cross w32/PA64 were genotyped to locate the gene on the short arm of chromosome 7. The rolled-leaf\n gene, tentatively named rl11(t), is likely a new gene as no other rolled-leaf genes have been identified near the region. By developing new SSR and InDel\n markers, the gene was delimited to a 52 kb region near the end of the short chromosome arm. Further fine mapping and cloning\n of the gene are currently underway.",

Arterial calcification (AC) is a clinically important complication of CKD-MBD. It can increase arterial stiffness, which leads to severe cardiovascular events. However, current treatments have little effect on regression of AC, as its mechanisms are still unclear. There are multiple risk factors of AC, among which Malnutrition-Inflammation Complex Syndrome (MICS) is a new and crucial one. MICS, a combined syndrome of malnutrition and inflammation, generally begins at the early stage of CKD and becomes obvious in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). It was linked to reverse epidemiology and associated with increased cardiovascular mortality in ESRD patients. Recent data suggest that MICS can trigger CKD-MBD and accelerate the course of AC. In this present review, we summarize the recent understanding about the aggravating effects of MICS on AC and discuss the possible underlyin...",

        "abstract": "Silicosis is caused by exposure to crystalline silica (CS). We have previously shown that blocking 4-1BB signaling attenuated CS-induced inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. However, the cells that express 4-1BB, which plays a vital role in promoting fibrosis, are still unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of 4-1BB is elevated in alveolar macrophages (AMs) in the lungs of CS-injured mice. CS exposure also markedly enhanced the expression of 4-1BB in macrophage-like, MH-S cells. In these cells, activation of the 4-1BB signaling with an agonist antibody led to upregulated secretion of pro-fibrotic mediators. Consistently, blocking 4-1BB downstream signaling or genetic deletion of 4-1BB alleviated pro-fibrotic responses , while treatment with a 4-1BB fusion protein promoted pro-fibrotic responses.  experiments showed that blocking 4-1BB signaling decreased the expressions of pro-fibrotic mediators and fibrosis. These data suggest that 4-1BB signaling plays an important role in promoting AMs-mediated pro-fibrotic responses and pulmonary fibrosis. Our findings may provide a potential molecular target to reduce CS-induced fibrotic responses in occupational lung disease.",

The Shape Estimation Algorithm based on the Boundary scattering transform and Extraction of Directly scattered waves (SEABED) can be used to reconstruct target shape, but it is restricted by the presence of the wall in the application of TWR. In this paper, a novel envelop curve algorithm is presented to adapt to the special conditions in TWR. To realize imaging of the target boundary, the algorithm extracts the quasi wavefront from the received signals and computes the envelop curve of a group of circles. FDTD numerical simulations validate that the algorithm can be used to obtain two-dimensional images of targets behind walls. The position error by the influence of the walls is also analyzed.",

We investigated the clinicopathological value of HIF-1α and Aurora-A in primary duodenal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Using immunohistochemistry, we evaluated Aurora-A and HIF-1α expression semiquantitatively in 140 PDA cases. There were 76 cases from one institute that formed the training set; 64 cases from another two institutes were used as the testing set to validate the prognostic value of Aurora-A and HIF-1α expression. Aurora-A expression was high or sufficient in the tumor zone, whereas expression was low in the adjacent normal epithelia. High Aurora-A expression, identified using the training set receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis-generated cutoff score, predicted poorer overall survival both in the testing set (18.0 vs. 45.1 %, P = 0.001) and training set (23.1 vs. 53.9 %, P = 0.011). Multivariate Cox regression confirmed that Aurora-A was an independent prognostic factor. Contrary to previous studies, we did not detect any correlation between Aurora-A and HIF-1α. Survival analysis showed that HIF-1α level was not correlated with patient outcome (P = 0.466). Activation of Aurora-A, an independent negative prognostic biomarker, might be used to identify particular PDA patients for more selective therapy.",

        "title": "Fundamental Limits on Uncertain Delays: When Is a Delay System Stabilizable by LTI Controllers?",
        "abstract": "This paper concerns the stabilization of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems subject to uncertain, possibly time-varying delays. The fundamental issue under investigation, referred to as the delay margin problem, addresses the question: What is the largest range of delay such that there exists a single LTI feedback controller capable of stabilizing all the plants for delays within that range? Drawing upon analytic interpolation and rational approximation techniques, we derive fundamental bounds on the delay margin, within which the delay plant is guaranteed to be stabilizable by a certain LTI output feedback controller. Our contribution is threefold. First, for single-input single-output (SISO) systems with an arbitrary number of plant unstable poles and nonminimum phase zeros, we provide an explicit, computationally efficient bound on the delay margin, which requires computing only the largest real eigenvalue of a constant matrix. Second, for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, we show that estimates on the variation ranges of multiple delays can be obtained by solving LMI problems, and further, by finding bounds on the radius of delay variations. Third, we show that these bounds and estimates can be extended to systems subject to time-varying delays. When specialized to more specific cases, e.g., to plants with one unstable pole but possibly multiple nonminimum phase zeros, our results give rise to analytical expressions exhibiting explicit dependence of the bounds and estimates on the pole and zeros, thus demonstrating how fundamentally unstable poles and nonminimum phase zeros may limit the range of delays over which a plant can be stabilized by a LTI controller.",

        "abstract": "Overweight and obesity are associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. However, the role of overweight and obesity in left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) of hypertensive patients is controversial. The aim of the current meta-analysis was to evaluate the influence of overweight and obesity on LVH regression in the hypertensive population.Twenty-eight randomized controlled trials comprising 2403 hypertensive patients (mean age range: 43.8-66.7 years) were identified. Three groups were divided according to body mass index: normal weight, overweight, and obesity groups.Compared with the normal-weight group, LVH regression in the overweight and obesity groups was more obvious with less reduction of systolic blood pressure after antihypertensive therapies (P < 0.001). The renin-angiotensin system inhibitor was the most effective in regressing LVH in overweight and obese hypertensive patients (19.27 g/m, 95% confidence interval [15.25, 23.29], P < 0.001), followed by β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics. In the stratified analysis based on blood pressure measurement methods and age, more significant LVH regression was found in 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) group and in relatively young patients (40-60 years' old) group (P < 0.01).Overweight and obesity are independent risk factors for LVH in hypertensive patients. Intervention at an early age and monitoring by ABPM may facilitate therapy-induced LVH regression in overweight and obese hypertensive patients.",

        "abstract": "Resolves several important open issues pertaining to a worst-case control-oriented system identification problem known as identification in H∞. First, a method is presented for developing confidence that certain a priori information available for identification is not invalid. This method requires the solution of a certain nondifferentiable convex program. Second, an essentially optimal identification algorithm is constructed. This algorithm is (worst-case strongly) optimal to within a factor of two. Finally, new upper and lower bounds on the optimal identification error are derived and used to estimate the identification error associated with the given algorithm. Interestingly, the development of each of these results draws heavily upon the classical Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation theory. As such, the authors' results establish a clear link between the areas of system identification and optimal interpolation theory. Both the formulation and techniques in this paper are applicable to problems where the frequency data available for identification may essentially be arbitrarily distributed",

        "abstract": "This study was purposed to evaluate the diagnostic value of procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum amyloid A (SAA) for bacteremia in patients with hematologic malignancy combined with febrile neutropenia. The total of 297 patients with hematologic malignancy combined with febrile neutropenia were analyzed retrospectively from 1253 patients admitted to West China hospital of Sichuan University from March 2011 to October 2012. They were divided into sepsis group (n = 95) and non-sepsis group (n = 202) according to blood culture. The results showed that the levels of PCT, CRP, IL-6 and SAA in sepsis group were higher than those in non-sepsis group, and there was statistically significant difference between these two groups (P < 0.05). The PCT had an AUC value of 0.974 (P < 0.05), and obviously higher than that of CRP (AUC = 0.681, P < 0.05), IL-6 (AUC = 0.661, P < 0.05) and SAA (AUC = 0.605, P < 0.05). When PCT had cut-off value of 1.06 ng/ml, sensitivity of 95.8%, specificity of 92.1%, and the Youden indicator of 0.879, the negative and positive predictive values were 97.8% and 85.0% respectively, the negative and positive likelihood ratios were 0.05 and 12.5 respectively, and all significantly higher than that of CRP, IL-6 and SAA. It is concluded that for patients with hematologic malignancy combined with febrile neutropenia and bacterial infection, the diagnostic value of serum PCT is superior to that of immune inflammatory factors (CRP, IL-6 and SAA), the PCT can predict the bacterium infection, provide laboratory evidence for rational antimicrobial drug usage and mortality reduction.",

        "abstract": "Silicosis is pneumoconiosis of the lung, usually resulting from prolonged exposure to crystalline silica (CS). The hallmark of silicosis is excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition produced by activated fibroblasts. Recent work demonstrated that excessive ECM-forming mechanical cues play an essential role in promoting fibroblast activation and perpetuating fibrotic pathologies. However, the detailed molecular mechanism still needs to be uncovered. : NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were cultured on either 1 kappa (soft) or 60 kappa (stiff) gel-coated coverslips. A series of knockdown and reverse experiments  were performed to establish the signaling for mechanics-induced fibroblast activation. An experimental model of silicosis was established by one-time intratracheal instillation of CS suspension. The cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44) antibody (IM7), dihydrotanshinone I (DHI) and verteporfin (VP) were used to explore the effect of CD44-RhoA-YAP signaling blockade on mechanics-induced fibroblast activation and CS-induced pulmonary fibrosis. : Matrix stiffness could induce nuclear translocation of the Yes-associated protein (YAP) through CD44 in fibroblasts. This effect required RhoA activity and F-actin cytoskeleton polymerization but was independent of Hippo pathway kinases, Mst 1 and Lats 1, forming CD44-RhoA-YAP signaling pathway. Pharmacological upstream blocking by CD44 antibody or downstream blockade of YAP by DHI or VP could attenuate fibroblast migration, invasion, proliferation, and collagen deposition. Furthermore, CD44-RhoA-YAP signaling blockade could alleviate CS-induced fibrosis and improve pulmonary function . : CD44-RhoA-YAP signaling mediates mechanics-induced fibroblast activation. Targeting this pathway could ameliorate crystalline silica-induced silicosis and provide a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate fibrosis.",

MTT colorimetric assay was used to evaluate the effect of interferon-gamma on Hep-2 cell proliferation after incubation with interferon-gamma. Hep-2 cell was harvested to be detected VEGF-C mRNA levels by realtime polymerase chain reaction (Realtime-PCR) with interferon-gamma (10(6) U/L) for 0, 2, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 h hours. The VEGF-C protein level in supernatants was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and in cytoplasma by immunocytochemical staining and Western blot analysis with the same drug treatment as Realtime-PCR.Hep-2 cell was significantly inhibited by IFN-gamma at high concentration. Expression of VEGF-C mRNA and protein levels of Hep-2 cell at 10(6) U/L concentrations of interferon-gamma were lower than that of normal control (P < 0.05) at 48 h.IFN-gamma can inhibit the expression of VEGF-C in Hep-2 cell with the level of mRNA and protein.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To evaluate the nutritional status and physical development level of preschool children in the suburb of Chongqing city,China,and to provide evidence for further nutritional intervention. METHODS A total of 350 preschool children who met the inclusion criteria from 3 kindergartens in Banan district of Chongqing were recruited in the present study,the children were measured and assessed their anthropometric data and the level of hemoglobin,vitamin A and zinc. RESULTS The prevalence of the preschool children who drank little milk or dairy products and never eat pluck were 34.26% and 72.00% respectively. The overall prevalence of underweight(WAZ﹤-2),stunting(HAZ﹤-2),wasting(BAZ﹤-2)and overweight or obesity(2≤BAZ﹤3)were 3.14%,5.71%,6.86% and5.85%,respectively. The mean hemoglobin concentration was(117.33±9.77)g/L,The overall prevalence of anemia was 25.14%;While the mean vitamin A concentration was(1.23±0.25)μmol/L,and the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency(VAD)and marginal vitamin A deficiency(MVAD)were 1.14% and 22.32%,respectively. The mean serum zinc concentration was(12.22±7.00)μmol/L,and the prevalence of serum zinc insufficient was 25.14%. The correlation coefficients of hemoglobin and vitamin A was r = 0.12,the incidence of anemia was 2.32 –fold higher in children with a lower vitamin A level than in those with a normal vitamin A level. CONCLUSION The overall prevalence of VAD,moderate and severe anemia of the preschoolers was low in this region,but MVAD and mild anemia remained high,while the physical development of children remained relatively low.",

        "abstract": "Iodine deficiency (ID)-induced hypothyroxinemia and hypothyroidism during development result in dysfunction of the central nervous system, affecting psychomotor and motor function, although the underlying mechanisms causing these alterations are still unclear. Therefore, our aim is to study the effects of developmental hypothyroxinemia, caused by mild ID, and developmental hypothyroidism, caused by severe ID or methimazole (MMZ), on the proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNPs), an excellent experimental model of cerebellar development and function. The sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway is essential for CGNP proliferation, and as such, its activation is also investigated here. A maternal hypothyroxinemia model was established in Wistar rats by administrating a mild ID diet, and two maternal hypothyroidism models were developed either by administrating a severe ID diet or MMZ water. Our results showed that hypothyroxinemia and hypothyroidism reduced proliferation of CGNPs on postnatal day (PN) 7, PN14, and PN21. Accordingly, the mean intensity of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Ki67 nuclear antigen immunofluorescence was reduced in the mild ID, severe ID, and MMZ groups. Moreover, maternal hypothyroxinemia and hypothyroidism reduced expression of the Shh signaling pathway on PN7, PN14, and PN21. Our study supports the hypothesis that developmental hypothyroxinemia induced by mild ID, and hypothyroidism induced by severe ID or MMZ, reduce the proliferation of CGNPs, which may be ascribed to the downregulation of the Shh signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "The main object of the present study was to explore the effect on thyroidal proteins following mild iodine deficiency (ID)-induced maternal hypothyroxinemia during pregnancy and lactation. In the present study, we established a maternal hypothyroxinemia model in female Wistar rats by using a mild ID diet. Maternal thyroid iodine content and thyroid weight were measured. Expressions of thyroid-associated proteins were analyzed. The results showed that the mild ID diet increased thyroid weight, decreased thyroid iodine content and increased expressions of thyroid transcription factor 1, paired box gene 8 and Na+/I- symporter on gestational day (GD) 19 and postpartum days (PN) 21 in the maternal thyroid. Moreover, the up-regulated expressions of type 1 iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO1) and type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO2) were detected in the mild ID group on GD19 and PN21. Taken together, our data indicates that during pregnancy and lactation, a maternal mild ID could induce hypothyroxinemia and increase the thyroidal DIO1 and DIO2 levels.",

        "abstract": "The delay margin of a time-delay system constitutes the fundamental limit beyond which no single controller may exist to robustly stabilize an unstable delay plant for a range of delay values. For single-input single-output (SISO) systems with a linear time-invariant (LTI) controller, this margin is known to be finite for an unstable plant, and bounds on the delay margin are available. This paper extends the existing results to multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. We derive upper bounds on a generalized notion called delay radius. Our results show that for a delay whose direction is orthogonal to that of an unstable pole, no constraint is imposed by the pole on that delay, while if the delay direction is parallel to that of a nonminimum phase zero, its allowable range will be further restricted by the nonminimum phase zero.",

        "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks rely on sensor devices deployed in an environment to support sensing and monitoring, including temperature, humidity, motion, and acoustic. Here, we propose a new approach to model physical phenomena and track their evolution by taking advantage of the recent developments of pattern recognition for nonlinear functional learning. These methods are, however, not suitable for distributed learning in sensor networks as the order of models scales linearly with the number of deployed sensors and measurements. In order to circumvent this drawback, we propose to design reduced order models by using an easy to compute sparsification criterion. We also propose a kernel-based least-mean-square algorithm for updating the model parameters using data collected by each sensor. The relevance of our approach is illustrated by two applications that consist of estimating a temperature distribution and tracking its evolution over time.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we study a worse-case, robust control oriented identification problem. This problem is in the framework of H/sub /spl infin// identification, but the formulation here is more general. The available a priori information in our problem consists of a lower bound on the relative stability of the plant, an upper bound on a certain gain associated with the plant, and an upper bound on the noise level. The plant to be identified is assumed to lie in a certain subset in the space of H/sub /spl infin//, characterized by the assumed a priori information. The available experimental information consists of a corrupt finite output time series obtained in response to a known nonzero but otherwise arbitrary input. The proposed algorithm is in the class of interpolatory algorithms which are known to possess desirable optimality properties in reducing the identification error. This algorithm is obtained by solving an extended Caratheodory-Fejer problem via standard convex programming methods. Both the algorithm and error bounds ran be applied to l/sub 1/ identification problems as well.",

        "abstract": "The chit42 gene cloned from Metarhizium anisopliae lacks chitin-binding domain (chBD), which plays important roles in binding insoluble chitin. Five kinds of hybrid chitinase Trichoderma transformants were constructed in this study, where the chit42 gene was fused to chBDs derived from plant, bacterial, and insect sources. The transformant Mc4 harboring chBDs from bitter melon (Momordica charantia) displayed the highest chitinase activity among all chBDs. The chitinase activities of Mc4, chit42 Trichoderma transformant Mchit3, and wild-type strain T30 were 44.94, 32.48, and 12.38 U/mL, respectively. The mortality rate of corn borer larvae in Mc4 fermentation liquid treatment increased by 10% and 30% compared with Mchit3 and T30, respectively. The midgut microvilli and goblet cell microvilli of the corn borer larvae exhibited distinct pathological changes after 48 h of feeding in Mc4 treatment. Mc4 also exhibited the strongest antifungal activity against Fusarium verticillioides and Rhizoctonia solani.",

        "abstract": "Objective To determine the best matching concentration of carbon nanoparticles suspension injection adsorb epirubicin by measuring the combination ratio of carbon nanoparticles suspension injection combined with epirubicin under different matching conditions.And then,to prove the adsorbability of carbon nanoparticles suspension injection adsorb epirubicin in vitro.Methods Firstly,epirubicin-carbon suspension of different concentrations will be prepared.The second,high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to assay the concentration of free epirubicin,and calculate the content of epirubicin that was combinated with carbon nanoparticles suspension injection.The difference of the ratio of carbon nanoparticles suspension injection combined with epirubicin under different matching conditions will be compared in the end.Results The combination ratio of carbon nanoparticles suspension injection combined with epirubicin solution of 5,10,and 15 mg/ml were 85.6%,85.7%,and 31.8%,respectively.Conclusions The adsorbability of carbon nanoparticles suspension injection adsorb epirubicin is favourable in vitro.Best matching concentration of carbon nanoparticles suspension injection adsorb epirubicin may be epirubicin solution of 5-10 mg/ml.",

        "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that miR-150-5p has an important role in regulating genesis of various types of cancer. However, the roles and the underlying mechanisms of miR-150-5p in development of colorectal cancer (CRC) remain largely unknown. Transwell chambers were used to analyze effects on cell migration and invasion by miR-150-5p. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting and dual-luciferase 3' UTR reporter assay were carried out to identify the target genes of miR-150-5p. In our research, miR-150-5p suppressed CRC cell migration and invasion, and MUC4 was identified as a direct target gene. Its effects were partly blocked by re-expression of MUC4. In conclusiomn, miR-150-5p may suppress CRC metastasis through directly targeting MUC4, highlighting its potential as a novel agent for the treatment of CRC metastasis.",

        "abstract": "Developmental iodine deficiency (ID) leads to inadequate thyroid hormone that impairs learning and memory with an unclear mechanism. Here, we show that hippocampal extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) are implicated in the impaired learning and memory in lactational and adolescent rat hippocampus following developmental ID and hypothyroidism.Three developmental rat models were created by administrating dam rats with either iodine-deficient diet or propylthiouracil (PTU, 5 ppm or 15 ppm)-added drinking water from gestational day (GD) 6 till postnatal day (PN) 28. Then, the total and phorsporylated ERK1/2 and total and phorsporylated CREB in the hippocampus were detected with western blot on PN14, PN21, PN28 and PN42.The iodine-deficient and hypothyroid pups showed lower serum FT3 and FT4 levels, smaller body size, and delayed eyes opening. The mean number of surviving cells in the hippocampus of the iodine-deficient and 15 ppm PTU-treated rats was significantly reduced compared to controls (P < 0.05). Iodine-deficient and 15 ppm PTU-treatment groups demonstrated significantly lower level of total and phosphorylated ERK1/2 and CREB than the controls on PN14, PN21 and PN28 (P < 0.05, respectively). The reduction of ERK1/2 and CREB was not reversible with the restoration of serum thyroid hormone concentrations on PN42.Developmental ID and hypothyroidism down-regulate hippocampal ERK1/2 and CREB in lactational and adolescent rats.",

        "abstract": "Exposure to arsenic is associated with an increased risk of lung disease. Novel strategies are needed to reduce the adverse health effects associated with arsenic exposure in the lung. Nrf2, a transcription factor that mediates an adaptive cellular defense response, is effective in detoxifying environmental insults and prevents a broad spectrum of diseases induced by environmental exposure to harmful substances. In this report, we tested whether Nrf2 activation protects mice from arsenic-induced toxicity. We used an in vivo arsenic inhalation model that is highly relevant to low environmental human exposure to arsenic-containing dusts. Two-week exposure to arsenic-containing dust resulted in pathological alterations, oxidative DNA damage, and mild apoptotic cell death in the lung; all of which were blocked by sulforaphane (SF) in an Nrf2-dependent manner. Mechanistically, SF-mediated activation of Nrf2 alleviated inflammatory responses by modulating cytokine production. This study provides strong evidence that dietary intervention targeting Nrf2 activation is a feasible approach to reduce adverse health effects associated with arsenic exposure.",

EGFR expression was examined by Western blot and flow cytometry. The biological features of the transfected A549 cells were assessed by cell cycle analysis, colony formation and chemosensitivity assay.Sequence-specific siRNAs targeting EGFR significantly down-regulated its expression in A549 cells. Cell growth and colony formation were inhibited by 85.0% and 63.3%, respectively, as compared to the non-sequence-specific siRNA treated cells. Decreased EGFR expression was accompanied by 12.7% increase in A549 cells in G(0)-G(1) phase and 6.6% decrease in S-phase. The EGFR sequence-specific siRNA transfected A549 cells were much more sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin with a 77.2% decrease in IC(50) compared to the non-sequence-specific iRNA transfected A540 cells.Down regulation of EGFR expression of NSCLC by sequence-specific siRNA may be considered as an additional option in the treatment of EGFR over-expressing cancers, including NSCLC.",

        "abstract": "Addresses a worst-case, robust control oriented identification problem. This problem is a variant in the general framework of H∞ identification problems which have been studied by several authors. In this problem the available a priori information consists of a lower bound on the relative stability of the plant, an upper bound on a certain gain associated with the plant, and an upper bound on the noise level. The plant to be identified is assumed to lie in a certain subset in the space of H∞. The available experimental information consists of a corrupt finite output time series obtained in response to a known nonzero but otherwise arbitrary input. The objective is to identify from the given a priori and experimental information an uncertain model which includes a nominal plant model in H ∞ and a bound on the modeling error measured in H∞ norm. The authors present both an identification error and several explicit lower and upper bounds on the identification error. The proposed algorithm is in the class of interpolatory algorithms which are known to posses desirable optimality properties in reducing the identification error. This algorithm may be obtained by solving an extended Caratheodory-Fejer problem via standard convex programming methods. The error bounds not only provide explicit estimates on the modeling error, but also are used to establish the convergence properties of the proposed identification algorithm",

        "abstract": "Silicosis is a fibrosing and irreversible lung disease. In China, 9870 new silicosis cases were reported in 2010. The physical and mental status of patients with silicosis should be paid attention to. The aims of this study were to evaluate the influence of the patients' functional capacity on subjective well-being (SWB) and quality of life (QOL), provide the scientific basis for further intervention measures, and improve their health status.We investigated 324 inpatients with silicosis during April 2011 to September 2011. The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) was the major methodology used to evaluate the functional capacity, the SF-12 (Short Form-12) to evaluate the QOL, and the MUNSH (Memorial University of Newfoundland Scale of Happiness) scale to evaluate the SWB.The distance of 6MWT suggested a significant and positive correlation with SWB and QOL of patients with silicosis (P < 0.01). In China, patients with silicosis had low SWB and QOL.The SWB and QOL of patients with silicosis are still relatively low and their health status needs improvement. At the same time, longer distances walked by patients suggest more positive influences on their SWB and QOL. It indicates that when the 6MWT cooperates with SWB and QOL, it may be able to get more accurate evaluation results of patients' survival status.",

        "abstract": "We evaluated a non-invasive method for predicting the ovarian function of premenopausal breast cancer patients with amenorrhoea after chemotherapy. A total of 34 patients had ovarian function, whereas 56 had no ovarian function. Logistic regression analysis indicated that age (P = 0.034; hazards ratio [HR], 0.29; confidence interval [CI], 0.091-0.910), follicle-stimulating hormone (P = 0.032; HR 0.97; CI 0.944-0.997) and oestradiol (P = 0.047; HR 1.01; CI 1.000-1.015) were independent influencing factors that determine ovarian function. The ovarian function score (OFS) (P < 0.001; HR 48.00; CI 10.174-226.452) was obtained through a comprehensive analysis of these three variables, and it could more effectively predict ovarian function. According to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the OFS had the highest values compared with the other three variables (sensitivity, 94.6 %; specificity, 79.3 %). The OFS is simple and easy to use; thus, it is expected to become a new method for determining drug-induced amenorrhoea in women with breast cancer. Ovarian function likely still exists if the OFS is ≤1. ",

The author considers both retarded and neutral delay systems expressed in state space form. The author's main goal is to provide a method for computing the maximal delay intervals for which the systems under consideration maintain stability. The author's results show that this can be accomplished by computing the generalized eigenvalues of certain frequency-dependent matrices. Based on these results, the author also states an improved necessary and sufficient condition concerning stability independent of delay for each of the retarded and neutral systems. The author's results appear to be simpler and may be implemented more easily than those developed elsewhere.",

Meanwhile, the higher activity of defense enzymes including PAL (phenylalanine ammonia lyase), POD (peroxidase) were also investigated in root after treated by TkA8. The maximum peaks of PAL and POD activity were enhanced by 3.21, 4.25 times over control respectively.

        "abstract": "Objective—  Vascular calcification (VC) is an important predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Osteogenic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is a key mechanism of VC. Recent studies show that IL-18 (interleukin-18) favors VC while TRPM7 (transient receptor potential melastatin 7) channel upregulation inhibits VC. However, the relationship between IL-18 and TRPM7 is unclear. We questioned whether IL-18 enhances VC and osteogenic differentiation of VSMCs through TRPM7 channel activation.  Approach and Results—  Coronary artery calcification and serum IL-18 were measured in patients by computed tomographic scanning and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Primary rat VSMCs calcification were induced by high inorganic phosphate and exposed to IL-18. VSMCs were also treated with TRPM7 antagonist 2-aminoethoxy-diphenylborate or TRPM7 small interfering RNA to block TRPM7 channel activity and expression. TRPM7 currents were recorded by patch-clamp. Human studies showed that serum IL-18 levels were positively associated with coronary artery calcium scores ( r =0.91;  P  P   Conclusions—  These findings suggest that coronary artery calcification is associated with increased IL-18 levels. IL-18 enhances VSMCs osteogenic differentiation and subsequent VC induced by β-glycerophosphate via TRPM7 channel activation. Accordingly, IL-18 may contribute to VC in proinflammatory conditions.",

In this study, we investigated whether changes in soil microbial diversity, following Streptomyces lydicus A01 treatment, were responsible for the increased tomato seedling growth. Eukaryotic 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing showed that S. lydicus A01-treated and untreated soil shared 193 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), whereas bacterial 16S rDNA sequencing identified 1,219 shared OTUs between the treated and untreated soil. Of the 42 dominant eukaryotic OTUs, 8 were significantly increased and 6 were significantly decreased after A01 treatment. Of the 25 dominant bacterial OTUs, 12 were significantly increased and 8 were significantly decreased after A01 treatment. Most of the eukaryotes and bacteria that increased in abundance exhibited growth promoting characteristics, which were mainly predicted to be associated with mineralization of nitrogen and phosphorus, phosphate solubilization, nutrient accumulation, and secretion of auxin, whereas some were related to plant protection, such as the degradation of toxic and hazardous substances. Soil composition tests showed that S. lydicus A01 treatment enhanced the utilization of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in tomato seedlings. Thus, microbial fertilizers based on S. lydicus A01 may improve plant growth, without the detriment effects of chemical fertilizers.",

        "abstract": "This retrospective study was aimed to investigate the efficacy of prophylactic agents in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients receiving TACE and compare the difference between lamivudine and entecavir.A consecutive series of 203 HBV-related HCC patients receiving TACE were analyzed including 91 patients given prophylactic agents. Virologic events, defined as an increase in serum HBV DNA level to more than 1 log10 IU/ml higher than the nadir level, hepatitis flares due to HBV reactivation and progression free survival (PFS) were the main endpoints.Some 48 (69.6%) reached virologic response. Prophylaxis significantly reduced virologic events (8.8% vs 58.0%, p=0.000) and hepatitis flares (1.1% vs 13.4%, p=0.001). Patients presenting undetectable HBV DNA levels displayed a significantly improved PFS as compared to those who never achieved undetectable HBV DNA. Prophylaxis and e-antigen positivity were the only significant variables associated with virologic events. In addition, prophylaxis was the only independent protective factor for hepatitis flares. Liver cirrhosis, more cycles of TACE, HBV DNA negativity, a lower Cancer of the Liver Italian Program score, non-metastasis and no hepatitis flares were protective factors for PFS. Prophylactic lamivudine demonstrated similar efficacy as entecavir.Prophylactic agents are efficacious for prevention of HBV reactivation in HCC patients receiving TACE. Achievement of undetectable HBV DNA levels displayed a significant capability in improving PFS. Moreover, persistent tumor residual lesions, positive HBV DNA and hepatitis B flares might be causes of tumor progression in these patients.",

The body weight and thyoid hormone levels of newborn rats were tested and the protein expressions of c-fos and c-jun in cerebellum tissue were determined with SP immunohistochemical technique and micrograph analyses system on 20 th, 30 th and 60 th postnatal day (PN). Results The average of body weight and FT3 and FT4 in all the postnatal period were significantly decreased(P<0.01) and the protein expression of c-fos and c-jun on 20PN, 30PN and 60PN was also down regulated significantly (P<0.05) compared with the controls. Conclusion Iodine deficiency of mother rat may down regulate the protein expression of c-fos and c-jun of their offspring which may result in damage of cerebellum development.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies the delay margin problem of discrete-time, linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. For general LTI plants with multiple unstable poles and nonminimum phase zeros, we employ analytic function interpolation and rational approximation techniques to derive bounds on the delay margin. Readily computable and explicit lower bounds are found by computing the real eigenvalues of a constant matrix, and LTI controllers can be synthesized based on the control theory to achieve the bounds. For first-order unstable plants, we also obtain bounds achievable by PID controllers, which are of interest to PID control design and implementation. It is worth noting that unlike its continuous-time counterpart, the discrete-time delay margin problem being considered herein constitutes a simultaneous stabilization problem, which is known to be rather difficult. While previous work on the discrete-time delay margin led to negative results, the bounds developed in this paper provide instead a guaranteed range of delays within which the delay plants can be robustly stabilized, and in turn solve the special class of simultaneous stabilization problems in question.",

METHODS Thirty nine strains of unrepeated SA(including 24 strains of MRSA) were collected from HAI and CAI,then subjected to detection for disinfectant resistant gene qacA/B by polymerase chain reaction(PCR),and the positive rates between different groups were compared. RESULTS The positive rates of qacA/B gene detected from SA strains in HAI and CAI groups were 52.2% and 18.8%,respectively,which was significantly different(P=0.0151,<0.05);The qacA/B gene positive rates in MRSA groups were 58.8%(HAI) and 0.0%(CAI),there was also a significant difference between them((P=0.0099,<0.01)),too. CONCLUSIONS The qacA/B gene is more epidemical in SA strains from HAI than that of CAI group,this may be due to high disinfectant selective pressure in hospital surroundings,and/or a more rapid transmitting speed for a qacA/B gene positive strain in hospital than in community.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study the robust consensus problem for a group of linear discrete-time agents to coordinate over an uncertain communication network, which is to achieve consensus against transmission errors and noises. We model the network by communication links subject to deterministic uncertainties, which can be either an additive perturbation described by some unknown transfer function or a norm bounded uncertainty. We show that the robust consensus problem with undirected communication topologies is equivalent to the simultaneous control problem for a set of low-dimensional subsystems. We derive a necessary condition for the existence of a protocol achieving robust consensus. That is, the upper bound of the uncertainties is less than the inverse of the Mahler measure of the agents. Sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities are further presented to design the robust consensus protocols.",

        "abstract": "Background Albumin-to-Alkaline Phosphatase Ratio (ALB/ALP ratio, AAPR), a newly developed index of liver function, has been rarely discussed about its prognostic value in malignancies. The current study attempted to evaluate the prognostic prediction of AAPR in advanced HCC. Methods 237 advanced HCC patients who refused any standard anti-cancer therapies were retrospectively analyzed. The threshold value of AAPR was determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Univariate analyses using Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test, and multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression model were conducted. Comparisons of ROC curves and likelihood ratio test (LRT) were utilized to compare the value of different factors in predicting survival. Results ROC curve analysis confirmed 0.38 as the optimal cutoff value of AAPR in evaluating overall survival (OS). Patients with an AAPR > 0.38 exhibited significantly lower frequencies of ascites, portal vein tumor thrombus, Child-Pugh grade B & C, and KPS < 70 (all P < 0.05). These patients also displayed a longer median survival time than those with an AAPR ≤ 0.38 (5.8 m vs 2.4 m, P < 0.01). Univariate and multivariate analyses identified AAPR as an independent prognostic indicator (HR = 0.592, P = 0.007). Furthermore, we integrated AAPR with TNM system and found that area under curve of AAPR-TNM system was significantly larger than that of TNM system when predicting 3-month survival (0.670 vs 0.611, P < 0.01). Moreover, LRT indicated that AAPR-TNM system had a significantly larger χ2 (26.4 vs 16.4, P < 0.01) and a significantly smaller Akaike information criterion value (1936 vs 1948, P < 0.01) comparing with TNM system. Conclusions Our study implied that AAPR was a potentially valuable prognostic index for advanced HCC patients without receiving any standard anti-cancer therapies. AAPR-TNM system preceded TNM system in predicting overall survival in this study.",

        "abstract": "Previous study showed that genetic drag between a blast resistance gene Pi25(t) and QTLs conditioning spikelet fertility (qSF-6) and number of filled grains per panicle (qNFGP-6) were detected on the short arm of rice chromosome 6. To further verify, a larger population was used for analysis and the results confirmed the genetic drag between the blast resistance and spikelet fertility (SF) but no genetic drag was detected between the blast resistance and number of filled grains per panicle (NFGP). Breakdown or avoidance of the genetic drag could be achieved by selection against the background genotype of a heading-date gene (qHD-7) that resided in the region between RM2 and RM214 on chromosome 7. To further validate, two lines with almost identical genotypes on all chromosomal regions except the Pi25(t) region on chromosome 6 were chosen to develop a new population. The results showed that qSF-6 could be further subdivided into qSF-6-1 and qSF-6-2. When the genotype of RM2-RM214 region was from rice variety Zhong 156, genetic drag between Pi25(t) and SF (qSF-6-2) was detected, and the allele of qSF-6-2 from rice variety Gumei 2 reduced SF. When genotype of the region between RM2-RM214 was from Gumei 2, no genetic drag was detected. The results indicated that genetic drag between the blast resistance and spikelet fertility could be broken down or avoided under a certain background genotype based on the selection against heading-date and provided a marker aided solution for high level of blast resistance and yield breeding in rice and other crops as well.",

By controlling the intracavity loss and spectral filtering, the cavity mode-locked by a single-wall carbon nanotube saturable absorber is able to generate two pulse trains at slightly different repetition rates simultaneously with high mutual coherence. Comparisons with the commercial interferometers located on the 80-m large-scale dimensional standard show a combined measurement uncertainty of 6    $mu$     $m+1times {10}^{-7}L,(k=2)$  , in an averaging time of 1 s.

        "abstract": "Iodine is essential for the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones, including triiodothyronine and thyroxine. Thyroid hormones are important for central nervous system development. Mild maternal iodine deficiency (ID)-induced hypothyroxinaemia causes neurological deficits and mental retardation of the foetus. However, the detailed mechanism underlying these deficits is still largely unknown. Given that the growth-associated protein of 43 kDa (GAP-43), semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) and the glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β)/collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) pathway are essential for axonal development, we hypothesise that hippocampal axonal growth-related proteins may be impaired, which may contribute to hippocampal axonal growth delay in rat offspring exposed to maternal hypothyroxinaemia. To test this hypothesis, maternal hypothyroxinaemia models were established in Wistar rats using a mild ID diet. Besides a negative control group, two maternal hypothyroidism models were created with either a severe ID diet or methimazole in the water. Our results showed that maternal hypothyroxinaemia exposure delayed offspring axonal growth on gestational day 19, postnatal day (PN) 7, PN14 and PN21. Consistent with this, the mean intensity of hippocampal CRMP2 and Tau1 immunofluorescence axonal protein was reduced in the mild ID group. Moreover, maternal hypothyroxinaemia disrupted expressions of GAP-43 and Sema3A. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of GSK3β and CRMP2 was also affected in the treated offspring, implying a potential mechanism by which hypothyroxinaemia-exposure affects neurodevelopment. Taken together, our data support the hypothesis that maternal hypothyroxinaemia may impair axonal growth of the offspring.",

Our main contribution includes an extended gain-phase integral formula and an extended sensitivity integral relation. These results are useful for analyzing certain fundamental design limitations that arise in linear multivariable feedback systems. In particular, they provide important insights into feedback properties which are unique to multivariable systems and which cannot be inferred from the scalar integral relations. Both results show that design limitations in multivariable systems depend strongly upon certain directionality properties",

        "abstract": "Epidemiologic study on the perinatal interaction of antioxidant vitamins and heavy metals on offspring's intellectual development is extremely limited. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to investigate the status of maternal and cord blood antioxidant vitamins (Vitamin A, E and C) and heavy metals (lead, cadmium and mercury) at delivery and correlations between these antioxidant vitamins or metals and neurodevelopment of early childhood, and to explore the protective effect of antioxidant vitamins against the injure of heavy metals to intellectual development in children in Tongliang, Chongqing, China.A total of 150 pairs of mothers-neonates were recruited. Serum concentrations of vitamin(V) A, vitamin E, vitamin C, lead, cadmium and mercury in maternal and cord blood after delivery were determined and intellectual development was evaluated by Gesell Development Schedule (GDS) at two years of age.A total of 111 pairs of maternal-neonatal subjects with completed data were included into statistical analysis. After adjusting for potential confounders, cord blood mercury level was found negatively associated with all the development quotients (DQs) (β = -0.486, β = -0.716, β = -0.846, β = -0.935, β = -0.702, P < 0.05). Cord VE level was positively correlated with motor, adaptation, language and average DQ (β = 0.475, β = 0.458, β = 0.403, β = 0.395, P < 0.05). When antioxidant vitamins and heavy metals levels were all included into the multiple regression model, cord vitamin E level was statistically positively related with motor, adaptation and average DQs (β = 0.449, β = 0.412, β = 0.349, P < 0.05). While cord blood mercury level was negatively correlated with adaptation, language, social and average DQ (β = -0.397, β = -0.727, β = -0.935, β = -0.628, P < 0.05), the relationship between cord mercury level and motor DQ was not statistically significant (P = 0.0890). The motor, adaptation, language and average DQs in high cord VE group were higher than those in low VE group (t = 2.93, t = 2.06, t = 2.13, t = 2.27, P < 0.05). Social DQ in high cord lead group was significantly lower than that in low lead group (χ(2) = 5.56, P = 0.015). Cord VC level in high cadmium group was significantly lower than that in low cadmium group (χ(2) = 7.62, P = 0.006). VA placental transport ratio in high mercury group was significantly lower than those in low mercury group (χ(2) = 8.02, P = 0.005).Our data suggested that there may be certain interaction between antioxidant vitamin A, E, C and heavy metals lead, cadmium, mercury. Antioxidant vitamins at delivery may have protective effect on the early neurodevelopment via interaction with the heavy metals.",

        "abstract": "Adequate thyroid hormone is critical for cerebellar development. Developmental hypothyroidism induced by iodine deficiency during gestation and postnatal period results in permanent impairments of cerebellar development with an unclear mechanism. In the present study, we implicate cerebellar caveolin-1 and synaptotagmin-1, the two important molecules involved in neuronal development, in developmental iodine deficiency, and in developmental hypothyroidism. Two developmental rat models were created by administrating dam rats with either iodine-deficient diet or propylthiouracil (PTU, 5 or 15 ppm)-added drinking water from gestational day 6 till postnatal day (PN) 28. Nissl staining and the levels of caveolin-1 and synaptotagmin-1 in cerebella were assessed on PN28 and PN42. The results show that the numbers of Purkinje cells were reduced in the iodine-deficient and PTU-treated rats. The upregulation of caveolin-1 and the downregulation of synaptotagmin-1 were observed in both iodine-deficient and PTU-treated rats. These findings may implicate decreases in the number of Purkinje cells and the alterations in the levels of caveolin-1 and synaptotagmin-1 in the impairments of cerebellar development induced by developmental iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism.",

We consider general linear agents and design both state feedback and dynamic output feedback control laws for the agents to achieve bipartite consensus. Via establishing an equivalence between bipartite consensus problems and the conventional consensus problems under both state feedback and output feedback control approaches, we make direct application of existing state feedback and output feedback consensus algorithms to solve bipartite consensus problems. Moreover, we propose a systematical approach to design bipartite consensus control laws. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley u0026 Sons, Ltd.",

The issue under investigation dwells on the question: What is the largest delay range within which a distributed control protocol is able to achieve and maintain the consensus? We consider second-order agents with real unstable poles communicating over an undirected network topology, and derive bounds on the delay margin. The results show that for a strictly unstable second-order multi-agent system, its consensuability robustness depends on the pole locations of the agents, as well as on the eigen-ratio of the network graph.",

        "abstract": "Superhydrophobic, water repellent surfaces have attracted much attention but poor surface mechanical properties have limited their wider practical application. Robust surfaces based on nickel–tungsten carbide composite coatings have been electrodeposited. The surfaces showed superhydrophobicity after being modified by stearic acid. The maximum contact angle of water was 164.3 degrees with a sliding angle close to zero. By controlling the deposition conditions, versatile coatings have been produced and the effects of morphology on wettability are discussed. Coating texture has been analyzed by X-ray diffraction. The surfaces showed excellent abrasion resistance and water-repellence.",

        "abstract": "Hypothyroxinemia induced by maternal mild iodine deficiency causes neurological deficits and impairments of brain function in offspring. Hypothyroxinemia is prevalent in developing and developed countries alike. However, the mechanism underlying these deficits remains less well known. Given that the myelin plays an important role in learning and memory function, we hypothesize that hippocampal myelinated growth may be impaired in rat offspring exposed to hypothyroxinemia induced by maternal mild iodine deficiency. To test this hypothesis, the female Wistar rats were used and four experimental groups were prepared: (1) control; (2) maternal mild iodine deficiency diet inducing hypothyroxinemia; (3) hypothyroidism induced by maternal severe iodine deficiency diet; (4) hypothyroidism induced by maternal methimazole water. The rats were fed the diet from 3 months before pregnancy to the end of lactation. Our results showed that the physiological changes occuring in the hippocampal myelin were altered in the mild iodine deficiency group as indicated by the results of immunofluorescence of myelin basic proteins on postnatal day 14 and postnatal day 21. Moreover, hypothyroxinemia reduced the expressions of oligodendrocyte lineage transcription factor 2 and myelin-related proteins in the treatments on postnatal day 14 and postnatal day 21. Our data suggested that hypothyroxinemia induced by maternal mild iodine deficiency may impair myelinated growth of the offspring. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol, 2014.",

        "abstract": "Elevated homocysteine (HCY) and smoking are both important risk factors for hypertensive patients. However, whether they have crossing effect on renal function deterioration of hypertensive patients and what is the underlying mechanism are unclear. In the present study, 3033 participants diagnosed as essential hypertension with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)> 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 from southern China were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. We collected the demographic and clinical data. In addition, the mediation effects were analyzed. The results showed that, comparing with non-smokers, smokers had significant higher levels of HCY (13.10 (11.20-16.87) vs. 11.00 (8.90-13.40) umol/L, P < 0.001) and lower eGFR (79.71 (66.83-91.05) vs. 82.89 (69.80-95.85) ml/min/1.73m2, P < 0.001). HCY levels and smoking were independently associated with decreased eGFR. Meanwhile, eGFR levels were significantly negatively correlated with HCY (P < 0.001), and this correlation might be stronger in current smokers. Current smoker consuming over 20 cigarettes per day would accelerate early renal function deterioration (OR = 1.859, P = 0.019). The mediation effects analysis further showed that the association between smoking and renal function deterioration was mediated by HCY. And elevated HCY was accounted for 56.94% of the estimated causal effect of smoking on renal function deterioration in hypertensive patients. Our findings indicated that cigarette smoking was associated with renal function deterioration in hypertensive patients, and the association between cigarette smoking and renal function deterioration was probably mediated by elevated HCY. Therefore, HCY-lowering therapy may be beneficial for renal function deterioration in hypertensive smoking patients.",

We develop a general information-theoretic paradigm for analyzing the limitations and tradeoffs imposed by communication channels, which is enabled by the development of new information measures and Bode-type integral inequalities. The integral inequalities quantify the tradeoffs in disturbance attenuation for broad classes of systems consisting of linear time-invariant plants and causal, possibly nonlinear, time-varying stabilizing controllers communicating over general noisy channels with causal encoders and decoders. The channel blurredness, a newly developed information measure for the quality of multiport communication channels, is used to characterize the effect of communication channel constraints on the integrals and henceforth the tradeoff in disturbance attenuation. For several canonical channels with power constraints, such as additive white Gaussian noise channels, additive colored Gaussian noise channels, and fading channels, we derive explicit forms for the channel blurredness, which, together with the Bode-type integral inequalities, show that to mitigate the noise effect on performance tradeoff, the power of the communication channels must be distributed in ways fundamentally different from the Shannon's classical water-filling power allocation policy.",

        "abstract": "Iodine deficiency (ID) during early pregnancy had an adverse effect on children's psychomotor and motor function. It is worth noting that maternal marginal ID tends to be a common public health problem. Whether marginal ID potentially had adverse effects on the development of cerebellum and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, our aim was to study the effects of marginal ID on the dendritic growth in filial cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) and the underlying mechanism. In the present study, we established Wistar rat models by feeding dam rats with a diet deficient in iodine and deionized water supplemented with potassium iodide. We examined the total dendritic length using immunofluorescence, and Western blot analysis was conducted to investigate the activity of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling and microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B). Our results showed that marginal ID reduced the total dendritic length of cerebellar PCs, slightly down-regulated the activity of NF-κB signaling and decreased MAP1B in cerebellar PCs on postnatal day (PN) 7, PN14, and PN21. Our study may support the hypothesis that decreased T induced by marginal ID limits PCs dendritic growth, which may involve in the disturbance of NF-κB signaling and MAP1B on the cerebellum. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "abstract": "To study the relationship between dietary vitamin A intake and plasma vitamin A concentration, and establish the theoretical basis for dietary intake predicting vitamin A nutritional status.By using cluster sampling, 492 children aged 2-7 years in kindergartens in Banan district of Chongqing were selected. A cross-sectional nutrition and health survey was conducted, including the clinical examination, anthropometry, laboratory test and dietary survey.Among the children surveyed, 229 were boys, and 263 girls, the mean age was (4.54 ± 0.87) years, height (107.50 ± 7.20) cm, and weight (18.42 ± 3.41) kg, the mean value of plasma vitamin A was (1.04 ± 0.30) μmol/L. The prevalence of marginal vitamin A deficiency (MVAD) was 43.5%. No cases of severe clinical vitamin A deficiency were found (plasma vitamin A ≤ 0.35 μmol/L). Clinical examination found no conjunctiva, corneaor skin abnormalities, and no Bitot's spots. Prevalence of the last two weeks colds were 27.4% (135/492), no diarrhea and other gastrointestinal or digestive diseases were found. The proportion of insufficient dietary vitamin A intake (<600 μg RE/d) was as high as 50.0%. By using correlation analysis, plasma retinol concentrations were related to dietary vitamin A intake (r=0.162, P<0.001), and to dietary energy intake (r=0.107, P=0.017). After adjustment for the effects of other non-dietary factors on vitamin A deficiency, the multivariate logistic regression showed that vitamin A-rich foods of liver intake=0 g/d (OR=1.95, 95% CI: 1.05-3.61, P=0.034), vitamin A-rich fruits intake=0 g/d (OR=1.55, 95% CI: 1.03-2.33, P=0.034), vitamin A-rich vegetables intake<200 g/d (OR=3.47, 95% CI: 1.37-8.75, P=0.009) were important risk factors of vitamin A deficiency. But we had not found the correlation between the intake of meat, eggs and milk and vitamin A deficiency.Dietary factors may be the major risk factor of vitamin A deficiency in the three kindergartens. The dietary vitamin A intakes are significantly related to plasma retinol concentrations, and the vitamin A-rich foods intakes can predict the body's vitamin A nutritional status.",

However, current evidence of its diagnostic value is conflicting, primarily due to the small sample sizes of previous studies, and its prognostic role in HCC also remains unclear. In the present study, sGP73 levels in 462 patients with HCC, 186 patients with liver cirrhosis, and 83 healthy controls were evaluated using ELISA, and it was identified that the median sGP73 levels were significantly higher in the HCC (18.7 ng/ml) and liver cirrhosis (18.5 ng/ml) patients than in the healthy controls (0 ng/ml; both P<0.001); however, the levels did not significantly differ between the HCC and liver cirrhosis groups (P=0.632). sGP73 had an inferior sensitivity and specificity for HCC diagnosis (27.79 and 77.96%, respectively) compared with α-fetoprotein (57.36 and 90.96%, respectively; P<0.001). In the HCC group, a high level of sGP73 was associated with aggressive clinicopathological features and independently predicted poor overall survival (OS) time (P<0.001). Additionally, in patients with resectable HCC, a high level of sGP73 was associated with significantly decreased disease-free survival (P<0.001) and OS (P=0.039) times compared with a low level of sGP73. This study demonstrated that sGP73 is unsuitable as a diagnostic marker for the early detection of HCC; however, it is an independent negative prognostic marker, providing a novel risk stratification factor and a potential therapeutic molecular target for HCC.",

Results:  The predictors included in the nomogram were total tumour volume, Child-Turcotte-Pugh class, plasma fibrinogen and portal vein tumour thrombus. Patients diagnosed as beyond A1 were stratified into low-, medium- and high-risk groups using nomogram scores of 0 and 51 with the total points of 225. Patients within A1 exhibited similar recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates compared with the low-risk group. Patients in the medium-risk group exhibited a similar OS but a worse RFS rates compared with patients within A1. The high-risk group was associated with worse RFS and OS rates compared with the patients within A1 (3-year RFS rates, 27.0% vs. 60.3%,  P  u003c 0.001; 3-year OS rates, 49.2% vs. 83.1%,  P  u003c 0.001).    Methods:  A total of 352 HCC patients undergoing curative resection from September 2003 to December 2012 were included to develop a nomogram to predict overall survival after resection. Univariate and multivariate survival analysis were used to identify prognostic factors. A visually orientated nomogram was constructed using a Cox proportional hazards model.    Conclusions:  This user-friendly nomogram offers an individualized preoperative recurrence risk estimation and stratification for HCC patients beyond A1 undergoing resection. Resection should be considered the first-line treatment for low-risk patients.",

        "abstract": "This research was aimed at estimating possible Coal workers’ pneumoconiosis (CWP) cases as of 2012, and predicting future CWP cases among redeployed coal workers from the Fuxin Mining Industry Group. This study provided the scientific basis for regulations on CWP screening and diagnosis and labor insurance policies for redeployed coal workers of resource-exhausted mines. The study cohort included 19,116 coal workers. The cumulative incidence of CWP was calculated by the life-table method. Possible CWP cases by occupational category were estimated through the average annual incidence rate of CWP and males’ life expectancy. It was estimated that 141 redeployed coal workers might have suffered from CWP as of 2012, and 221 redeployed coal workers could suffer from CWP in the future. It is crucial to establish a set of feasible and affordable regulations on CWP screening and diagnosis as well as labor insurance policies for redeployed coal workers of resource-exhausted coal mines in China.",

        "abstract": "We cloned a novel Tad1 gene and demonstrated that this gene is closely involved in copper bioaccumulation in Trichoderma reesei. Tad1 gene encodes a 510 amino acids protein of the amidohydrolase superfamily which belongs to COG0402. We found that adenine was the most efficient substrate of Tad1 protein among the substrates used in this study. Gene function was also investigated by overexpression and RNA interference. Results showed that copper accumulation increased in mutant cells when Tad1 was overexpressed; by contrast, copper accumulation significantly decreased when Tad1 was inhibited. To investigate the function of Tad1 in copper bioaccumulation, we determined adenine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine concentrations by reversed phase HPLC. Tad1 overexpression induced a substantial production of xanthine, which functions in binding numerous copper ions and reducing copper concentration. We further compared the gene expression profile of AT01 with that of a wild-type T. reesei strain grown in a medium containing 1.0mM Cu(2+) by performing DNA microarray. Several upregulated genes in the mutant were associated with adenine or copper metabolism.",

        "abstract": "Silicosis is an inflammatory and fibrotic lung disease caused by inhalation of silica. Th17 cells play a key role in causing silica-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis. Baicalin, a compound isolated from the Chinese herb Huangqin, could suppress the differentiation of Th17 cells and alleviate inflammation. However, there are very few reports of the immunoregulatory mechanisms of baicalin in experimental silica-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis. In our study, mice were exposed to silica by intratracheal instillation, and in this way we established an experimental silicosis model. To elucidate the effects and mechanisms of baicalin in silica-induced inflammation and fibrosis, we used baicalin to treat the developed mouse model of silicosis. Treatment with baicalin attenuated the accumulation of inflammatory cells and led to milder pathological inflammatory and fibrotic changes in lung tissues. Baicalin affected the immunological balance between Th17 and Treg responses. Therefore, baicalin caused a decrease in Th17 cells by stimulating Treg cells and by inhibiting IL-6 and IL-23. We further demonstrated that silica-induced Th1 and Th2 immune responses were both inhibited by increased Treg activation, which was promoted by baicalin. Our findings confirmed the potential functions of baicalin in inhibiting the Th17 response and reducing silica-induced inflammation and fibrosis.",

The ZmDIP expression varied in roots, leaf sheaths, and young, as well as old, leaves of different maize inbred lines. The ZmDIP transcript level changed in leaves over the course of time after inoculation with C. lunata. A prokaryotic expression analysis demonstrated that the gene can regulate the salt stress tolerance of Escherichia coli. The ZmDIP transient expression in the maize leaf showed that the gene was also linked to leaf resistance against the C. lunata infection. ZmDIP-mediated ROS and ABA signaling pathways were inferred to be closely associated with maize leaf resistance to the pathogen infection.",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were employed to analyze the proteome from leaves of cucumber R17 at 24,48 and 72 h,after inoculating Sphaerotheca fuliginea. The results showed that there were significant differences between inoculated plants and control in the 2-DE map. Seven different proteins of R17 seedling leaves with qualitative changes or relatively high abundance were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF searching NCBI,including a protein of putative phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase,hypothetical protein g5bf,LHCⅡ type I chlorophyll a/b-binding protein,ferredoxin-NADP(H) oxidoreductase,putative XS domain containing protein,unconventional myosin XI and malate dehydrogenase. This study gives new insights into pathogen stress response in cucumber leaves and demonstrates the power of the proteomic approach in plant biology studies.",

        "abstract": "As a deposition depression mainly with the Mesozoic strata,the Chaoshan Depression is an important area for gas and oil exploration in the South China Sea.Plenty of multi-channel seismic data has been obtained in this area,but it is hard to get reflection wave velocity with enough fidelity from the stacking velocity spectrum due to strong multiple interference.Since remarkable information of refraction wave velocity could be obtained from the multi-channel seismic data of top interface of the Mesozoic strata,a program package is provided in this paper to pick up refraction seismic velocity from the multi-channel seismic data.In the experiment area,the water depth is 600—800m,and the maximum offset of the survey line is 6 250m.The obtained refraction velocity of the Tertiary is 2.0-2.5 km·s-1,which is similar to the velocity of the Tertiary in the other areas of the Chaoshan Depression.The refraction velocity of the Mesozoic in the southwestern part of the Chaoshan Depression is about 3.5-4.5 km·s-1,generally lower than that of 4.0-5.0 km·s-1 in the middle and eastern parts of the Chaoshan Depression,which may imply that the reservoir property for oil and gas in the southwestern part is better.",

Patients with Asian ethnicity are reported to have a higher response rate with gefitinib monotherapy. However, a higher incidence of interstitial lung disease, sometimes lethal, is also found. The combination of gefitinib and radiotherapy has been observed to have a synergistic, anti-proliferative effect against NSCLC in vitro. This phase I study assessed the safety, clinical feasibility and optimally tolerated regimen (OTR) of this combination in patients with pretreated locally advanced or metastatic (IIIB/IV) NSCLC. Methods: Patients with stage IIIB or selected stage IV, failure of platinum-based chemotherapy regimen NSCLC were eligible. Four Cohorts of eight patients each were planned to be treated with escalating doses from 54 to 60 Gy of conformal or intensity- modulated radiotherapy (2Gy/Fx) administered in combination with gefitinib 250mg daily during RT and 60 days after t...",

Here, we cloned a gene from Trichoderma reesei named Tmac1, whose deduced amino acid sequence showed 29% identical to Mac1p. Furthermore, two Cys-His repeats metal binding motifs of Tmac1p, one in the 354-369C terminus and one in the 475-490C terminus were also present in Mac1p. A deletion mutant of Tmac1 was hypersensitive to the copper starvation and showed poor growth. Subsequently, the function was recovered by the gene complementation experiment. Furthermore, the Tmac1 gene fully complemented growth defects of yeast ΔMac1 mutant. The expression of Tmac1p was activated at low concentration of copper and depressed when the concentration of copper excess 1mM. Furthermore, the fluorescence intensity enhanced at copper starvation and decreased under copper excess by fusion the eGFP to the Tmac1p. It proved that the expression of Mac1p was exactly regulated by copper concentration, because eGFP and Mac1p were expressed under the control of the same one promoter. We also cloned a gene named Tctr3 with bioinformatics. With a series of experiments, we proved it was the target gene of Tmac1. To sum up, Tmac1 may encode a transcriptional activator regulated high-affinity copper transport in T. reesei.",

Results The serum levels of IL-2,TNF-α,INF-γ of the hepatogenous diabetes group were( 57. 2 ± 23. 8) pg / ml,( 48. 2 ± 35. 1) ng / ml,( 89. 2 ± 55. 3) pg / ml,which were higher than that of the control group [( 48. 5 ± 22. 1) pg / ml,( 30. 2 ± 23. 3) ng / ml,( 58. 3 ± 37. 4 ) pg / ml,P < 0. 05]. The serum levels of IL-4,IL-8 of the hepatogenous diabetes group[( 1. 2 ± 0. 5) pg / ml,( 34. 4 ± 16. 7) pg / ml]were lower than that of the control group[( 3. 3 ± 1. 2) pg / ml,( 57. 1 ± 20. 8) pg / ml,P < 0. 05]. There were no significant difference between 2 groups in IL-6 and IL-10 serum levels[( 1. 3 ± 0. 4) pg / ml vs. ( 1. 5 ± 0. 5) pg / ml,( 5. 2 ± 3. 4) pg / ml vs. ( 5. 5 ±2. 8) pg/ml,P >0. 05]. Conclusion The unbalance the cytokine network of the patients with hepatogenous diabetes and liver cirrhosis may exacerbate the disease progression.",

We study the asymptotic behavior of the critical characteristic zeros of such systems on the imaginary axis. This behavior determines whether the imaginary zeros cross from one half plane into another, and hence plays a critical role in determining the stability of a time-delay system. We consider time-delay systems given in both state-space form and as a quasipolynomial. Our results reveal that in the former case the zero asymptotic behavior can be characterized by solving a simple eigenvalue problem, and in the latter case, by computing the derivatives of the quasipolynomial. To perform such an analysis, we make use of an operator perturbation approach",

The bounds are derived for a system setting with linear time-invariant plants and causal stabilizing controllers communicating over noisy communication channels. We utilize the notion of power gain to measure the worst-case power reduction from the disturbance to the error signal. Concepts from information theory such as entropy and mutual information are instrumental in the analysis, and the performance bounds can be quantified explicitly in terms of the channel blurredness, a measure of poorness on the channel quality, and the plant unstable dynamics.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study the robust consensus problem for a group of linear discrete-time or continuous-time agents to coordinate over an uncertain communication network, which is to achieve consensus against transmission errors and noises. We model the network by communication links subject to deterministic uncertainties, which can be additive perturbations described by either some unknown transfer functions or norm bounded matrices. We show that the robust consensus problem can generally be solved by solving a simultaneous H control problem for a set of low-dimensional subsystems. We also derive necessary conditions for the existence of a protocol achieving robust consensus. The results show that for discrete-time agents the uncertainty size must not exceed the inverse of the Mahler measure of the agents, while for continuous-time agents it must be less than the unity. Sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities are further presented to design the robust consensus protocols.",

        "abstract": "Advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs) are independent risk factor for various cardiovascular diseases. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis has been implicated as an important mechanism in cardiac remodeling in chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, whether AOPPs affect cardiomyocyte apoptosis and subsequent cardiac remodeling in CKD is still not very clear. Here, we assessed the role of AOPPs in cardiomyocyte apoptosis in CKD. H9C2 rat cardiomyoblast cells were exposed to AOPPs. The apoptotic cells were determined by TUNEL assay. The expression of apoptotic markers (cleaved caspase-3 and Bax), JNK signaling and endoplasmic reticulum stress were explored. Serum AOPPs were measured in male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent sham surgery and 5/6 nephrectomy respectively. In vitro, our findings showed that AOPPs activated JNK signaling and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and significantly aggravated H9C2 rat cardiomyoblast cells apoptosis. These effects were partially ameliorated by apocynin with inhibition of oxidative stress. In vivo, serum levels of AOPPs were progressively elevated with the increasing time course in CKD rats as compared with sham-operated rats (P<0.05). Serum AOPPs levels were positively associated with cardiomyocyte apoptosis (R2= 0.76, P<0.01). In conclusion, AOPPs aggravate cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vitro, and these effects are partially prevented by apocynin via suppressing JNK signaling and endoplasmic reticulum stress with oxidative stress inhibition. In vivo, AOPPs are increased in CKD model and may contribute to the cardiac pathogenesis but at this point it is unclear if that is true. These results suggest that pharmacological approaches to attenuate AOPPs-aggravated cardiomyocytes apoptosis may be beneficial to improve cardiac remodeling in CKD.",

However, not every memory level can gain a sound performance improvement when the push technique is adopted. In this paper, we devise a quantitative approach to analyze workload on the bus. For balancing workload, we propose a novel architecture, which compounds the push and prefetching technique to serve different storage levels. Between the L1 and the L2 cache, we use the push technique. Between the L2 cache and memory, we utilize the prefetching technique. Focusing on the L2 cache prefetching, we propose AAP and AAPM, both of which meet the requirement of timeliness and bandwidth adaptability and can increase the IPC by 2% compared with SRP.",

        "abstract": "The delay margin of a time-delay system constitutes the fundamental limit beyond which no single controller may exist to robustly stabilize an unstable delay plant for a range of delay values. For single-input single-output systems with a linear time-invariant controller, this margin is known to be finite, and bounds on the delay margin are available. This paper extends the existing results to multi-input multi-output systems. We derive upper bounds on a generalized notion called delay radius. Our results show that for a delay whose direction is orthogonal to that of an unstable pole, no limit is imposed by the pole, while if the delay direction is parallel to that of a nonminimum phase zero, its allowable range is further restricted.",

The problem is to check the existence of an uncertainty and a measurement noise which fit to the given model structure and the uncertainty/noise description, as well as the experimental data used for invalidation. We consider a mixed setting in which the uncertainty is characterized in time domain by the /spl lscr//sub 1/ induced system norm, while the available data are frequency response samples of the system. We show that this problem, which by formulation poses an infinite-dimensional primal optimization problem, can be solved in a dual, finite-dimensional space with finitely many constraints.",

        "abstract": "Long term pulmonary exposure to crystalline silica leads to silicosis that manifests progressive interstitial fibrosis, eventually leading to respiratory failure and death. Despite efforts to eliminate silicosis, clinical cases continue to occur in both developing and developed countries. The exact mechanisms of crystalline silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis remain elusive. Herein, we find that 4-1BB is induced in response to crystalline silica injury in lungs and that it is highly expressed during development of experimental silicosis. Therefore, we explore the role of 4-1BB pathway during crystalline silica-induced lung injury and find that a specific inhibitor blocking the pathway could effectively alleviate crystalline silica-induced lung inflammation and subsequent pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. Compared to controls, the treated mice exhibited reduced Th1 and Th17 responses. The concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-17A following crystalline silica challenge were also reduced in inhibitor-treated mice. Although there was no significant alteration in Th2 cytokines of IL-4 and IL-13, another type of pro-fibrogenic cell, regulatory T cell (Treg) was significantly affected. In addition, one of the major participants in fibrogenesis, fibrocyte recruited less due to the blockade. Furthermore, we demonstrated the decreased fibrocyte recruitment was associated with chemokine reductions in lung. Our study discovers the 4-1BB pathway signaling enhances inflammatory response and promotes pulmonary fibrosis induced by crystalline silica. The findings here provide novel insights into the molecular events that control crystalline silica-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis through regulating Th responses and the recruitment of fibrocytes in crystalline silica-exposed lung.",

        "abstract": "Coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP) is a preventable, but not fully curable occupational lung disease. More and more coal miners are likely to be at risk of developing CWP owing to an increase in coal production and utilization, especially in developing countries. Coal miners with different occupational categories and durations of dust exposure may be at different levels of risk for CWP. It is necessary to identify and classify different levels of risk for CWP in coal miners with different work histories. In this way, we can recommend different intervals for medical examinations according to different levels of risk for CWP. Our findings may provide a basis for further emending the measures of CWP prevention and control.The study was performed using longitudinal retrospective data in the Tiefa Colliery in China. A three-layer artificial neural network with 6 input variables, 15 neurons in the hidden layer, and 1 output neuron was developed in conjunction with coal miners' occupational exposure data. Sensitivity and ROC analyses were adapted to explain the importance of input variables and the performance of the neural network. The occupational characteristics and the probability values predicted were used to categorize coal miners for their levels of risk for CWP.The sensitivity analysis showed that influence of the duration of dust exposure and occupational category on CWP was 65% and 67%, respectively. The area under the ROC in 3 sets was 0.981, 0.969, and 0.992. There were 7959 coal miners with a probability value < 0.001. The average duration of dust exposure was 15.35 years. The average duration of ex-dust exposure was 0.69 years. Of the coal miners, 79.27% worked in helping and mining. Most of the coal miners were born after 1950 and were first exposed to dust after 1970. One hundred forty-four coal miners had a probability value > or =0.1. The average durations of dust exposure and ex-dust exposure were 25.70 and 16.30 years, respectively. Most of the coal miners were born before 1950 and began to be exposed to dust before 1980. Of the coal miners, 90.28% worked in tunneling.The duration of dust exposure and occupational category were the two most important factors for CWP. Coal miners at different levels of risk for CWP could be classified by the three-layer neural network analysis based on occupational history.",

        "abstract": "Recently, environmental nonylphenol (NP) exposure in the fetus and child has received increasing attention because of its potentially deleterious effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Microglia (MG), resident immune cells in the CNS, are vital to CNS homeostasis and defense against exogenous chemicals, which makes them a potentially sensitive target of NP. The present study aims to explore the effects of maternal NP exposure during pregnancy and lactation on MG in offspring hippocampus, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by MG, and associated underlying mechanisms. We found that maternal NP exposure increased the production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in offspring hippocampus. Increases in both activation and number of MG were observed in offspring hippocampus. Increased phosphorylation of Akt was found to co-localize with hippocampal MG, while increased phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were observed in offspring hippocampus. Activator protein 1 (AP-1), an inflammatory transcription factor, was also activated in the hippocampus of pups subjected to maternal NP exposure. These results suggest that maternal NP exposure might activate MG in offspring hippocampus. This activation seems to subsequently increase the production of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Furthermore, Akt/MAPK/AP-1 signaling may be involved in this activation of MG and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

TWR signal processing consists of two key parts-moving target detection (MTD) and imaging algorithm. An adaptive background subtraction method for extracting the information of moving targets is presented in this paper, which outperforms conventional MTD techniques. Then an improved BP algorithm is also introduced, which considers the presence of walls. FDTD numerical simulations and experimental results validate that the proposed algorithm can be used to track and image moving targets behind walls. The results also show that the proposed algorithm has the characteristics of simple antenna array requirement, high position accuracy and real time imaging.",

        "abstract": "Maternal hypothyroxinemia can induce neurodevelopmental impairments in the developing fetus. We here review recent studies on the epidemiology and molecular mechanisms associated with this important public health issue. In 2011, the American Thyroid Association defined maternal hypothyroxinemia as low serum free thyroxine (FT4) levels (<5th or <10th percentile) existing in conjunction with normal serum free triiodothyronine (FT3) or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels during pregnancy. Compared to clinical or subclinical hypothyroidism, hypothyroxinemia is more commonly found in pregnant women. Hypothyroxinemia usually ensues in response to several factors, such as mild iodine deficiency, environmental endocrine disrupters, or certain thyroid diseases. Unequivocal evidence demonstrates that maternal hypothyroxinemia leads to negative effects on fetal brain development, increasing the risks for cognitive deficits and poor psychomotor development in resulting progeny. In support of this, rodent models provide direct evidence of neurodevelopmental damage induced by maternal hypothyroxinemia, including dendritic and axonal growth limitation, neural abnormal location, and synaptic function alteration. The neurodevelopmental impairments induced by hypothyroxinemia suggest an independent role of T4. Increasing evidence indicates that adequate thyroxine is required for the mothers in order to protect against the abnormal brain development in their progeny.",

Disease-specific survival (DSS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) rates were compared according to serum ApoA-I level. Multivariate analysis was performed to assess the prognostic value of serum ApoA-I.The 5-year DSS, DMFS, and LRFS rates for patients with elevated or decreased serum ApoA-I were 81.3% versus 69.3% (P < 0.001), 83.4% versus 67.4% (P < 0.001), and 80.9% versus 67.3% (P < 0.001), respectively. ApoA-I ≥ 1.025 g/L was an independent prognostic factor for superior DSS, DMFS, and LRFS in multivariate analysis. After stratification by clinical stage, serum ApoA-I remained a clinically and statistically significant predictor of prognosis.Our data suggest that the level of ApoA-I at diagnosis is a novel independent prognostic marker that could complement clinical staging for risk definition in non-metastatic NPC.",

        "abstract": "To investigate whether RNA interference (RNAi) induced by small interference RNA (siRNA) could suppress epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells.SPC-A-1 cells were transfected using chemically synthesized double stranded RNA (dsRNA) formulated with Lipofectamine 2000. The EGFR numbers were determined by both Western blot and flow cytometry. The antiproliferative effects of dsRNA-EGFR were assessed using cell counts and colony assay. Cell cycle analysis was carried out via flow cytometry. The chemosensitivity of transfected cells to cisplatin was determined by MTT.Sequence specific siRNAs targeting EGFR down-regulated EGFR expression significantly. Compared with the control group, dsRNA-EGFR reduced the cell numbers by 78.3% and decreased the colonies by 66.8%. Cell cycle analysis showed that dsRNA-EGFR induced accumulation of cells in G0-G1 phase by 17.48% with a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in S-phase by 19.20% relative to the control. Based on the value of IC50 obtained by Origin 6.0 software, we concluded that dsRNA-EGFR increased the sensitivity of SPC-A-1 to cisplatin by seven-fold.Sequence specific siRNAs targeting EGFR was capable of suppressing EGFR expression, and therefore, significantly inhibiting cellular proliferation and inducing cell cycle arrest. The finding from chemosensitivity assay further revealed that dsRNA-EGFR was associated with an addictive or synergistic effect on tumor growth inhibition when combined with cisplatin. The successful application of dsRNA-EGFR for inhibition of proliferation in EGFR overexpressing cells extends the list of available therapeutic modalities in the treatment of human cancer.",

Methods The T cell subgroups and the expression of CD28,CD152 and ICOS on peripheral T cells in healthy-control group,disease-control group and treatment group were determined by flowcytometry. Results The total number of T lymphocytes were not significantly different among three groups.Compared with disease-control group,the number of CD4~+ T cell of the treatment group was much lower and the number of CD8~+T cell was much higher;The expressions of CD28 and ICOS significantly decreased while the CD152 expression obviously increased. Conclusions FK506 plays an important role in the quick correction of the turbulence of T cell subgroup balance.Through inhibiting the expression of positive costimulators and promoting the expression of negative costimulator CD152,FK506 blocks the activating signal transduction at the upper stream of T cell immune signal pathway and thus inhibits the activation of T cell.",

Hot plate, tail flick, acetic acid-induced writhing, and formalin tests were conducted in mice to evaluate the antinociceptive actions. Forced swimming and rotarod tests of mice were used to assess the sedation and depression actions.In [(3)H]diprenorphine binding assay, MB-1C-OH did not bind to μ- and δ-opioid receptors at the concentration of 100 μmol/L, but showed a high affinity for κ-opioid receptor (Ki=35 nmol/L). In [(35)S]GTPγS binding assay, the compound had an Emax of 98% and an EC50 of 16.7 nmol/L for κ-opioid receptor. Subcutaneous injection of MB-1C-OH had no effects in both hot plate and tail flick tests, but produced potent antinociception in the acetic acid-induced writhing test (ED50=0.39 mg/kg), which was antagonized by pretreatment with a selective κ-opioid receptor antagonist Nor-BNI. In the formalin test, subcutaneous injection of MB-1C-OH did not affect the flinching behavior in the first phase, but significantly inhibited that in the second phase (ED50=0.87 mg/kg). In addition, the sedation or depression actions of MB-1C-OH were about 3-fold weaker than those of the classical κ agonist (-)U50,488H.MB-1C-OH is a novel κ-opioid receptor agonist that produces potent antinociception causing less sedation and depression.",

        "abstract": "By introducing an additional comb beyond its dual-comb predecessor, tri-comb consisting of three combs with different mode spacing has shown its unique potential in several metrology areas such as nonlinear spectroscopy, frequency, and distance measurement. However, tri-comb generation based on three frequency-stabilized comb lasers would be overly complicated and costly for many potential applications. Previous studies had realized dual-comb generation from a single-cavity laser by leveraging multiplexing in one of the waveguiding dimensions of the optical pulses. Such sources with built-in passive mutual coherence could greatly reduce system complexity. Yet, squeezing more combs into one multiplexing dimension becomes increasingly difficult without significant sacrifice in performance, which could jeopardize the usefulness of such a scheme. In this paper, it is proposed and demonstrated that multi-comb generation could be realized by tapping into the multidimensional joint parameter space. Up to four wavelength/polarization multiplexed, asynchronous ultrashort pulse sequences can be generated with good stability from an all-fiber, mode-locked ring-cavity laser. This could offer an attractive alternative solution as the low-complexity light sources for field-deployable multi-comb metrology applications.",

One hundred and twenty patients with stage I, II, or III primary breast cancer were randomly divided into three groups: the lymphatic chemotherapy group using the activated carbon nanoparticle-epirubicin suspension, the epirubicin control group, and the activated carbon control group. Each group of 40 patients was further divided into two subgroups with the drug injected either 24 or 48 h before surgery. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was used to determine cancer cell apoptotic indices in metastatic lymph nodes. The epirubicin concentration in the black-stained lymph nodes in the lymphatic chemotherapy treatment group was 4,144.64 ± 2,426.44 ng/g, which is significantly higher than in the epirubicin control group (335.87 ± 212.82 ng/g, P < 0.001). The plasma epirubicin concentrations at 0.5, 1.5, and 24 h postinjection in the regional lymphatic chemotherapy treatment group were significantly lower than in the epirubicin control group (P < 0.001). Tolerable mild pain was observed at the injection area after administration of the epirubicin-activated carbon nanoparticle suspension. No regional necrosis or adverse effects were found. The TUNEL assay demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the apoptotic indices in the metastatic lymph nodes from the three groups. Performing lymphatic chemotherapy by regionally injecting the epirubicin-activated carbon nanoparticle suspension could significantly enhance the drug concentration in the stained lymph nodes and lower the plasma drug concentration. The epirubicin-activated carbon nanoparticle suspension has the ability to release the drug slowly in the lymph nodes and, as a result, can prolong the chemotherapeutic effects.",

The communication network is modeled by a signed directed graph, where both cooperative and competitive interactions coexist among the agents. Each individual agent is assumed to access only the local information, and a fully distributed control protocol is proposed. Using this control protocol, we find that sign consensus can be achieved without requiring the graph to have an eventually positive adjacency matrix.",

        "abstract": ": Lymphocytes were reported to play a significant part in host anticancer immune responses and influence tumour prognosis. Few studies have focused on the prognostic values of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to lymphocyte ratio (ALRI), aspartate aminotransferase to platelet count ratio index (APRI) and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with palliative treatments. : Five hundred and ninety-eight HCC patients treated with palliative therapies were retrospectively analysed. We randomly assigned patients into the training cohort (429 patients) and the validation cohort I (169 patients). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify the best cut-off values for the ALRI, APRI and SII in the training cohort and the values were further validated in the validation cohort I. Correlations between ALRI and other clinicopathological factors were also analysed. A prognostic nomogram including ALRI was established. We validated the prognostic value of the ALRI, SII and APRI with two independent cohorts, the validation cohort II of 82 HCC patients treated with TACE and the validation cohort III of 150 HCC patients treated with curative resection. In the training cohort and all the validation cohorts, univariate analyses by the method of Kaplan-Meier and multivariate analysis by Cox proportional hazards regression model were carried out to identify the independent prognostic factors. : The threshold values of ALRI, APRI and SII were 86.3, 1.37 and 376.4 respectively identified by ROC curve analysis in the training cohort. Correlation analysis showed that ALRI>86.3 was greatly associated with higher rates of Child-Pugh B&C, portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) and ascites ( 0.05). Correspondingly, ALRI level of HCC patients with Child-Pugh B&C, PVTT and ascites was evidently higher than that of HCC patients with Child-Pugh A, without PVTT and without ascites ( 0.001). In the training cohort and the validation cohort I, II, III, the OS of patients with ALRI >86.3 was obviously shorter than patients with ALRI ≤86.3 (0.001). We identified ALRI as an independent prognostic factor by univariate and multivariate analyses both in training Cohort (HR=1.481, 0.004), validation cohort I (HR=1.511, 0.032), validation cohort II (HR=3.166, 0.005) and validation cohort III (HR=3.921, 0.010). The SII was identified as an independent prognostic factor in training cohort (HR=1.356, 0.020) and the validation cohort II (HR=2.678, 0.002). The prognostic nomogram including ALRI was the best in predicting 3-month, 6-month, 1-year, 2-year survival And OS among TNM, ALRI, ALRI-TNM and nomogram. : The ALRI was a novel independent prognostic index for the HCC patients treated with palliative treatments.",

In the sense of the multi-rate systems, some sensors may have no measurements at certain sampling times, which can be regarded as measurement missing and may significantly degrade the estimation performance. The main purpose of this paper is to design an estimator by using a multi-rate MHE (MMHE) strategy. A binary switching sequence is introduced to model the multi-rate sampling, and the missing sample of the slow measurement is compensated by a prediction value. By choosing a cost function, the optimal estimator is obtained by solving a regularized least-squares problem. The stability analysis for the optimal estimator is also presented. Finally, a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

The ion adsorbility were studied on the Fe2+ aqueous solution with different conditions, such as temperature, pH and ion concentration etc. The results indicated that the NIPAAm grafted PP fabric possess the ability of adsorbing the Fe2+ ions at lower pH (around pH 0) and lower temperature(5 ℃). The adsorbed Fe2+ ions were easily desorbed at higher temperature (50 ℃).",

        "abstract": "To explore the relationship between Fas-FasL-mediated signal transduction pathway and apoptosis disorder of T lymphocyte subset in SLE patients.The expression rate of membrane Fas, FasL and that of intracellular activated caspase-3 of T lymphocyte subset were determined by flow cytometry.Compared with healthy control group, the expression rate of membrane Fas on CD4(+) T cells significantly increased in SLE patients in the active and inactive phases (P<0.05), however, that on CD8(+) T cells slightly increased but there was no statistical significance (P>0.05). The expression rate of FasL on T cell subset in SLE patients in the active and inactive phases significantly increased (P<0.05) but there was no obvious difference of the expression rate of Fas and FasL on T cell subset between the two disease groups (P>0.05). The expression rate of intracellular activated caspase-3 in T cell subset of SLE patients in the active phase was notably higher than that in the inactive phase and healthy control group (P<0.05). The expression rate of intracellular activated caspase-3 in T cell subset of SLE patients in the inactive phase was slightly higher than that in health control group but there was no statistical significance.Apoptotic speed of T lymphocyte subset in SLE patients was accelerated while CD4(+) T cells were in a state of active apoptosis. It is possible that Fas-FasL signal transduction pathway plays an important role in the induction of T cell apoptosis. The degree of apoptosis of T lymphocytes closely correlates with the disease's activity in SLE patients.",

A total of 23 QTLs for yield traits were detected using a linkage map consisting of 149 markers. The numbers of QTLs detected for individual traits were 2 for the number of panicle per plant (NP), 4 for the number of filled grains per panicle (NFGP), 6 for the total number of spikelets per panicle (TNSP), 5 for spikelet fertility (SF), 4 for 1000-grain weight (TGWT) and 2 for grain yield per plant (GYD). Nine of the QTLs had the enhancing alleles from the Dongxiang wild rice, including 2 for NP, 1 for NFGP, 5 for TNSP and 1 for TGWT. Six of them were located in intervals where QTLs for yield traits have been reported in other studies using 9 interspecies populations. The 23 QTLs were distributed in all the 12 rice chromosomes except chromosome 11. Eighteen of the QTLs were located in 8 clusters. The enhancing alleles were from Xieqingzao B in 4 clusters and from the Dongxiang wild rice in 2 clusters, while the allelic direction in the remaining clusters varied for different traits.",

        "abstract": "Vascular calcification (VC) is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We recently reported that apocynin had benefits for preventing cardiovascular diseases. However, whether apocynin could attenuate VC is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of apocynin in VC and its underlying mechanisms. 163 participants with high or normal ankle-brachial index (ABI) were enrolled in this study for analyzing the demographic and biochemical data. In vitro, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were exposed to calcification medium containing b-glycerophosphate and angiotensin II (Ang II) for 24 hours. The results showed that serum level of Ang II was significantly increased in patients with high ABI (P<0.05). In cultured VSMCs, Ang II significantly exacerbated osteogenic switching. The expression of osteogenic phenotype markers, including bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and osteopontin (OPN), were significantly upregulated, whereas contractile markers expression, including alpha smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) and smooth muscle 22 alpha (SM22a) were simultaneously downregulated. However, these effects were greatly attenuated by apocynin. Apocynin enhanced expression of a-SMA by 5.3%, and reduced expression of BMP2, Runx2, OPN by 3.37%, 0.61% and 3.07%, respectively. Furthermore, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation was upregulated by Ang II, and this effect was also reversed by apocynin. Intriguingly, pretreatment with U0126, an inhibitor of ERK1/2, had similar effects with apocynin. Apocynin may act as a novel molecular candidate to protect against VSMCs osteogenic switching through suppressing ERK1/2 pathway.",

        "abstract": "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in metastasis of gastric cancer. Our previous study showed that Gastrokine-2 (GKN2) can inhibit the metastasis of SGC-7901 and AGS cells. Herein, we further explored the role of GKN2 in epithelial mesenchymal transition of gastric cancer cells and the underlying mechanisms. We found that overexpression of GKN2 can lower the protein expression level of Snail and markedly elevate E-cadherin protein level in SGC7901 and AGS cells. Further data showed that knockdown of snail can inhibit the migration and invasion of SGC-7901 and AGS cells. It is known that Snail can be phosphorylated by GSK3β, a downstream protein of PI3K/AKT pathway. We then test protein expression of p-GSK3β(Ser-9), the downstream protein of PI3K/AKT, which was significantly decreased under the circumstance of GKN2 overexpression. Moreover, LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, can reverse the protein expression change of E-cadherin and snail induced by siGKN2. Taken together, these findings suggested that GKN2 suppressed epithelial mesenchymal transition of gastric cancer cells by downregulation of snail through PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "Proteomic approaches using two-dimensional gel electrohoresis(2-DE)were adopted to identify proteins from cucumber leaves differentially expressed in F2 generation of cucumber.Nearly 500 proteins were reproducibly detected,including 39 specific proteins expressed in F2 sensitive pool samples and 22 specific proteins expressed in resistance pool samples,35 proteins were two-fold upper limit and 46 proteins were two-fold lower limit.Analysis with MALDI-TOF-MASS showed that nine important proteins associated with defensive reaction were identified in F2 cucumber,a protein of disease resistance gene(SSP3110),14-3-3 brain protein homolog(SSP1411),coproporphyrinogen Ⅲ oxidase(SSP5513),carbonic anhydrase(SSP5412),alpha-galactosid-ase-like protein(SSP5710),putative protein(SSP6002),17.8 kDa class small heat shock protein(SSP0710),hypothetical protein(SSP3111),(S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidase(EC1.1.3.15)-cucurbit(SSP4610).All of those proteins were probably parts of network of resistance or development-related proteins.This study gives new insights into cucumber powdery mildew resistant response in cucumber leaves and demonstrates the power of the proteomic approach in plant biology studies.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the safety and availability of compont medical adhesive in the meshes’ fixation of TAPP. Methods Sixty cases of primary inguinal hernia treated by the TAPP in our department during Jan to Jul 2009 were reviewed. A control study in the operation between compont medical adhesive and auto-suture tacks was carried out and all were follow-up for 7~14 months. Results Both of the two groups had no relapse. Hematoma occurred in two case of auto-suture tacks group and one in the compont medical adhesive group. Pain experienced in the auto-suture tacks group in one or none in the compont medical adhesive group. The operative time in the auto-suture tacks group was (37±10)min and the compont medical adhesive group was (55±10)min(P = 0.036). The postoperative length of stay in the auto-suture tacks group was (3.2±1.3) days and the compont medical adhesive group was (2.9±1.2) days, without significant difference (P = 0.231). The cost of hospitalization in the auto-suture tacks group was (9267±785)yuan and the compont medical adhesive group was (6542±863)yuan (P = 0.000). There were more cases with postoperative pain in the auto-suture tacks group than the compont medical adhesive group (P ≤ 0.05). Conclusions The appliacation of the compont medical adhesive in the TAPP has hemostasis effect and can reduce the occurrence of postoperative hematoma and pain. It is a safe and available treatment approach.",

        "abstract": "Sorafenib, which is a novel targeted agent, plays an important role in treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through its antiangiogenic and antiproliferative effects. However, conventional morphology-based radiographic evaluation systems may underestimate the efficacy of sorafenib in HCC due to a lack of apparent tumor shrinkage or altered tumor morphology in many cases. This calls for the development of more accurate imaging methods for evaluating sorafenib. The introduction of tumor burden measurements based on viability and other evolving imaging approaches for assessing therapeutic effects are promising for overcoming some of the limitations of the morphology-based criteria. In this review, we summarize various imaging methods that are used to assess treatment responses of advanced HCC to sorafenib. Imaging markers predictive of prognosis in advanced HCC after treatment with sorafenib are also included and discussed.",

The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the composites was tested from room temperature to 1400 °C using a thermal dilatometer before and after heat treatment. The CTE value of C/SiC-TaC is higher than that of C/SiC composites. The thermal expansion behavior was qualitatively analyzed from thermal stress, preparation method and composition. The results show that the CTE of the composites increases slowly as the temperature increases at low temperature range (below 1100 °C). The increase in CTE is contributed by the thermal expansion of 90° non-woven cloth, TaC and SiC. The fluctuations of CTE are related to the structural stress, residual silicon and asymmetrical distribution of porosities. In high temperature range (above 1100 °C), the controlling factors of thermal expansion are 0° non-woven cloth and interfacial thermal stress. The heat-treatment resulted in the decrease in CTE values at temperatures below 1100 °C and also change the CTE behavior of the composites at temperatures higher than 1100 °C.",

        "abstract": "The clinicopathological characteristics of small intestinal neuroendocrine neoplasms (SI-NENs) and the prognostic validity of WHO grading classification for SI-NENs are still unknown in Asian patients.277 patients and 8315 patients with SI-NENs were retrieved respectively from eleven Chinese hospitals and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry. Overall survival was used as the major study outcome. Survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank test and cox regression analysis were applied.Clinicopathological characteristics of SI-NENs were quite different among different races. Duodenum was the predominant tumor site in Chinese patients and Asian/Pacific Islander patients but not in white patients from SEER database. Patients with duodenal NENs tended to have more localized disease than patients with jejunal/ileal NENs which were confirmed by patients from SEER database. Grade 3 or poorly differentiated/undifferentiated tumor were more common and tumor size was significantly larger in ampullary NENs compared with that in non-ampullary duodenal NENs. As for the prognostic validity of WHO grading classification, survival between patients with grade 1 and grade 2 disease was not significantly different. Ki-67 index of 5% might be a better threshold between grade 1 and grade 2 than Ki-67 index of 2% in SI-NENs.Our study revealed that the clinicopathological characteristics of SI-NENs among different races were quite different. This might because duodenal NENs was much more common in Chinese patients and Asian/Pacific Islander patients. Duodenal NENs and jejunal/ileal NENs, ampullary and non-ampullary duodenal NENs shared different characteristics. Ki-67 index of 5% might be a better threshold between grade 1 and grade 2 in SI-NENs.",

Methods Female Wistar rats(n=28)after pregenancy were randomly divided into control group,hypothyroid group and iodine deficient group. According to the dose of propylthiouracil (PTU)in the fed water,hypothyroid group was divided into 5 ppm group and 15 ppm group(7 rats in each group). Totally 5 pups from each group were sacrificed and perfused intracardially in postnatal day(PN) 7,PN14 and PN21. Brains were removed,fixed and sectioned coronally. All sections were observed and analysed for the protein exression of calcineurin by immunohistochemistry in the hippocampus CA1,CA3 and DG regions. Results In PN14 and PN21,protein levels of cal-cineurin in CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus in iodine-deficient and 15 ppm treatment groups were significantly higher than those of the controls (P < 0.05)and in DG region,the contrary was true. In PN7,the positive products were scarely observated in each region and the protein expression was no significantly different in all four groups. Conclusion Iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism may increase the protein expression of calcineurin.",

Multiple immune cells have been demonstrated to participate in crystalline silica-induced immune responses. Our previous study indicated that B10 could control lung inflammation through modulating the Th balance in experimental silicosis in mice. However, the regulatory mechanism of B10 on CD4 T cells is still unclear. MACS-sorted CD19 B cells from the three different groups were cultured with CD4 T cells either with or without transwell insert plates to evaluate the effects of B10 on CD4 T cells, including Teff and Treg. B10 was eliminated by anti-CD22 application in vivo. Flow cytometry was used to test the frequencies of CD4 T cells, and the expressions of the related cytokines were detected by real-time PCR and CBA. Insufficient B10 elevated the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and promoted Th responses in a way independent upon cell-cell contact in the Teff and B cell coculture system. B10 could both increase Treg activity and enhance conversion of Teff into Treg. Our findings demonstrated that B10 could affect Th responses by the release of IL-10, enhancing Treg functions and converting Teff into Treg.",

        "abstract": "Inhalation of crystalline silica particles leads to pulmonary fibrosis, eventually resulting in respiratory failure and death. There are few effective drugs that can delay the progression of this disease; thus, patients with silicosis are usually only offered supportive care. Dioscin, a steroidal saponin, exhibits many biological activities and health benefits including its protective effects against hepatic fibrosis. However, the effect of dioscin on silicosis is unknown.We employed experimental mouse mode of silicosis. Different doses of dioscin were gavaged to the animals 1 day after crystalline silica instillation to see the effect of dioscin on crystalline silica induced pulmonary fibrosis. Also, we used RAW264.7 and NIH-3T3 cell lines to explore dioscin effects on macrophages and fibroblasts. Dioscin was also oral treatment but 10 days after crystalline silica instillation to see its effect on established pulmonary fibrosis.Dioscin treatment reduced pro-inflammation and pro-fibrotic cytokine secretion by modulating innate and adaptive immune responses. It also reduced the recruitment of fibrocytes, protected epithelial cells from crystalline silica injury, inhibited transforming growth factor beta/Smad3 signaling and fibroblast activation. Together, these effects delayed the progression of crystalline silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The mechanism by which dioscin treatment alleviated CS-induced inflammation appeared to be via the reduction of macrophage, B lymphocyte, and T lymphocte infiltration into lung. Dioscin inhibits macrophages and fibroblasts from secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines and may also function as a modulator of T helper cells responses, concurrent with attenuated phosphorylation of the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1-p38/c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway. Also, dioscin could block the phosphorylation of Smad3 in fibroblast. Oral treatment of dioscin could also effectively postpone the progression of established silicosis.Oral treatment dioscin delays crystalline silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis and exerts pulmonary protective effects in mice. Dioscin may be a novel and potent candidate for protection against crystalline silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis.",

However grid applications that need reliable data transfer still have difculties to achieve optimal TCP performance due to network tuning of TCP window size to improve bandwidth and to reduce la- tency on a high speed wide area network. This paper presents a Java package called JPARSS (Java Parallel Se- cure Stream (Socket)) that divides data into partitions that are sent over several parallel Java streams simultaneously and allows Java or Web applications to achieve optimal TCP performance in a grid environment without the ne- cessity of tuning TCP window size. This package enables single sign-on, certicate delegation and secure or plain- text data transfer using several security components based on X.509 certicate and SSL. Several experiments will be presented to show that using Java parallel streams is more effective than tuning TCP window size. In addition a simple architecture using Web services to facilitate peer to peer and third party le transfer will be presented.",

We investigate the best achievable tracking performance, where the performance is deemed best for it is the minimal attainable by all possible sampled-data stabilizing controllers. Our primary objective is to investigate the fundamental tracking performance limit in sampled-data systems, and to understand whether and how sampling and hold in a sampled-data system may impose intrinsic barriers to performance. For this purpose we derive an analytical expression for the optimal tracking performance. The result shows that a performance loss is generally incurred in a sampled-data system, in comparison to the tracking performance achievable by continuous-time controllers. This loss of performance, as so demonstrated by the expression, can be attributed to the non-minimum behaviors and the aliasing effects generated by samplers and hold devices.",

        "abstract": "The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients receiving transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is far from being identified. The present study aimed to assess the role of blood cell counts, routine liver function tests, and alanine aminotransferase to hemoglobin ratio (AHR) in predicting the progression-free survival (PFS) of these patients. A total of 243 HCC patients receiving TACE were analyzed retrospectively. Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score system was indentified to be the best score system for this patient subgroup according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC) index and linear trend χ (2). Then, prognostic value of parameters was determined by integration into the CLIP score system. As a result, AHR was confirmed to be an independent predictor for the PFS of HCC patients receiving TACE (p = 0.001) with the other parameters failing to reach statistical significance. Moreover, AHR improved the performance of CLIP by adjusting into it, thus improving its discriminatory ability. AHR defined ≤0.4583 as low level and >0.4583 as high level. And, patients were also dichotomized into two groups accordingly. HCC patients receiving TACE with low AHR presented higher 1 year DCR (41.9 vs 18.1 %) compared with patients with high AHR levels. Furthermore, AHR level was associated with prognostic factors such as lower ALP, total bilirubin, and portal vein thrombosis. In summary, the present study firstly indentified AHR as an independent prognostic factor in HCC patients receiving TACE. The subgroup of HCC patients with lower AHR presented preferable disease control and were the idealistic candidates for TACE. ",

        "abstract": "Objective:To establish a method for determination and confirmation of flonicamid residue in five kinds of animal-derived foods by gas chromatography(GC) and liquid chromatography mass-mass spectrometry(LC/MS-MS).Methods: The samples of meat and aquatic products were extracted by ethyl acetate,then the extract was cleaned up by gel permeation chromatography(GPC) and NH2SPE cartridge,while honey was cleaned up by CHROMABOND XTR and NH2SPE cartridges.The concentration of flonicamid residue was analyzed by GC with ECD and confirmed by LC/MS-MS with EI.Results: For GC-ECD,there was a good linear relationship between the peak area and the concentration of flonicamid within range of 10 μg/kg to 500 μg/kg(correlation coefficient ≥ 0.999).When the spiked level of flonicamid ranged from 10 μg/kg to 200 μg/kg,the mean recoveries of the method varied from 74.5% to 98.2% and the relative standard deviations(RSD) ranged from 1.02% to 7.98%.The results showed that the limit of detection(LOD) was 1.0 μg/kg and the limit of quantification(LOQ) was 5.0 μg/kg.The flonicamid was confirmed by LC/MS-MS and the limit of detection was 5.0 μg/kg.Conclusion: The method was simple,fast and accurate.",

Linearized DNA of plasmid pV2 bearing the hygromycin B phosphotransferase (hph) gene was inserted into chromosomes of wild strain T23 and transformation was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis, respectively. Of 247 transformants, 76% showed improved dichlorvos degradation ability as compared to the parent strain T23 based on the least significant difference (LSD) test at p=0.01. Among them, 8 transformants exhibited 30% higher in degradation rate than the parent isolate. The highest dichlorvos degradation rate of the transformants was up to 96%. This study provided an effective approach for improving organophosphate pesticide-degrading capability of T. atroviride.",

We assume that such channel consists of multiple correlated SISO channels subject to independent input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraints. We derive explicit conditions for which mean square stabilization can be achieved under such constraints for unstable minimum phase plants, and characterize the controller that achieves such SNR. We also present the set of admissible SNR constraints for mean square stability for a particular set of plants. Our results show that noise correlation can reduce the SNR requirements for stability compared to independent additive white noise channels. In addition, a numerical simulation is provided to illustrate the theoretical results.",

        "abstract": "【Objective】 Soil and water conservation benefits and suitability of different young afforested trees were evaluated in tableland-gully area of the Loess Plateau.【Method】 The runoff,soil erosion,soil water content and physiological characteristics of,mono-species of R.pseudoacacia,P.tabulaeformis,P.orientalis,H.rhamnoides and their mixtures in vegetated runoff plots were analyzed taking grassland as a control.【Result】 The results demonstrated that in the early stage of afforestation,the benefits of water and soil conservation were relatively poor for all afforested tree species and afforestation methods.The differences of soil erosion amounts between each tree species under monoculture or biculture resulted from differences in vegetation cover.The relationship between soil erosion and vegetation cover could be expressed by a quadratic function.Regression analysis showed that soil erosion was not severe when vegetation cover was more than fifty percent.Soil water content varied with the soil depth within the top 250 cm in grassland and each woodlot,but it became more or less constant below the 250 cm depth.R.pseudoacacia consumed most soil water,followed by P.orientalis,P.tabulaeformis,and H.rhamnoides with the last two being similar to the grassland.There were no significant differences in soil water contents between mono-species and its binary mixtures,except for R.pseudoacacia and its mixtures.Water use efficiency followed the order of:P.orientalis > P.tabulaeformis ≈H.rhamnoides > R.pseudoacacia.The leaf water use efficiencies of both P.tabulaeformis and H.rhamnoides in the mixture were significantly increased compared to the monocultures.The leaf transpiration rates followed the order of:R.pseudoacacia ≈H.rhamnoides > P.tabulaeformis > P.orientalis.Compared to their monocultures,the leaf transpiration rates of P.tabulaeformis and R.pseudoacacia decreased in their biculture mixed with H.rhamnoides,while the transpiration rates of H.rhamnoides remained relatively constant.【Conclusion】 Considering soil and water conservation benefits and adaptability of each tree species,we could conclude that the biculture of H.rhamnoides and P.tabulaeformis is very likely suitable for afforestation in tableland-gully areas of the Loess Plateau.",

        "abstract": "A number of studies have examined the association between interleukin-6 (IL-6) rs1800796 polymorphism and risk of lung cancer but revealed inconsistent results. The aim of this study was to clarify the association between IL-6 rs1800796 polymorphism and risk of lung cancer.Literature databases including PubMed, Embase and CNKI were searched up to January 2014. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) under co-dominant model, dominant model and recessive model were estimated using random-effects model.A total of seven studies, including 2691 lung cancer cases and 3067 controls, were included in the meta-analysis. The results suggested that IL-6 rs1800796 polymorphism was not associated with risk of lung cancer under homogeneous co-dominant model (OR = 1.06, 95%CI = 0.73-1.54), heterogeneous co-dominant model (OR = 1.24, 95%CI = 0.96-1.60), dominant model (OR = 1.23, 95%CI = 0.95-1.58) and recessive model (OR = 0.96, 95%CI = 0.70-1.32). The association was still not significant in either never-smokers (OR = 1.19, 95%CI = 0.95-1.48) or ever-smokers (OR = 1.73, 95%CI = 0.89-3.36).The present meta-analysis suggested that there was no association between IL-6 rs1800796 polymorphism and lung cancer, which was independent of smoking status.The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/1060061508127855.",

However,the low differentiation efficiency(less than 10%) of MSCs in vivo could not explain its recovery function in theory. Recent studies have reported that MSCs can regulate the local injury microenvironment via paracrinal pathways and facilitate the restore of impaired tissues,indicating that the microenvironment regulation of MSCs plays more important role than its differentiation in clinical recovery. The current paper reviewed the regulatory effects of MSCs in local microenvironment of damaged tissue,providing theoretical basis for broadly clinical application of MSCs transplantation therapy.",

        "abstract": "In this technical note we present a stability analysis approach for polynomially-dependent one-parameter systems. The approach, which appears to be conceptually appealing and computationally efficient and is referred to as an eigenvalue perturbation approach, seeks to characterize the analytical and asymptotic properties of eigenvalues of matrix-valued functions or operators. The essential problem dwells on the asymptotic behavior of the critical eigenvalues on the imaginary axis, that is, on how the imaginary eigenvalues may vary with respect to the varying parameter. This behavior determines whether the imaginary eigenvalues cross from one half plane into another, and hence plays a critical role in determining the stability of such systems. Our results reveal that the eigenvalue asymptotic behavior can be characterized by solving a simple generalized eigenvalue problem, leading to numerically efficient stability conditions.",

        "abstract": "Background: In mainland China, awareness of disease of elderly cancer patients largely relies on the patientsu0027 families. We developed a staged procedure to improve their awareness of disease. Materials and Methods: Participants were 224 elderly cancer patients from 9 leading hospitals across Southern China. A questionnaire was given to the oncologists in charge of each patient to evaluate the interaction between family and patients, patient awareness of their disease and participation in medical decision-making. After first cycles of treatment, increased information of disease was given to patients with cooperation of the family. Then patient awareness of their disease and participation in medical decision-making was documented. Results: Among the 224 cancer elderly patients, 26 (11.6%) made decisions by themselves and 125 (55.8%) delegated their rights of decision- making to their family. Subordinate family members tended to play a passive role in decision-making significantly. Patients participating more in medical decision-making tended to know more about their disease. However, in contrast to the awareness of disease, patient awareness of violation of medical recommendations was reversely associated with their participation in medical decision-making. Improvement in awareness of diagnosis, stages and prognosis was achieved in about 20% elderly cancer patients. About 5% participated more actively in medical decision-making. Conclusions: Chinese elderly cancer patient awareness of disease and participation in medical decision-making is limited and relies on their family status. The staged procedure we developed to improve patient awareness of disease proved effective.",

        "abstract": " Iodine is critical for synthesis of thyroid hormones (TH). And iodine deficiency (ID) is one of the most significant reasons of intellectual disability and motor memory impairment, although the potential mechanisms are still under investigation. Presently, mild ID and marginal ID are largely ignored problems for women of child bearing age. Mild ID is a subtle form of TH deficiency, which shows low levels of free thyroxine (FT) and relatively normal free triiodothyronine (FT) or thyroid stimulation hormone (TSH). And marginal ID is a milder form of ID with decreased total T (TT) but relatively normal FT, FT, and TSH. Therefore, we investigated the effects of maternal different degrees of ID on the development of pinceau in cerebellar purkinje cells (PCs) and studied the expression of pinceau related protein, which is crucial for the development and maturation of pinceau.  Three developmental iodine deficient rat models were created by feeding dam rats with an iodine-deficient diet and deionized water supplemented with potassiumiodide. Our study showed that different degrees of ID inhibited cerebellar pinceau synapse development and maturation on postnatal day (PN) 14 and PN21. What's more, mild and severe ID reduced the expression of AnkG, β4-spectrin, neurofascin186 and NrCAM on PN7, PN14, and PN21. However, marginal ID rarely altered expression of these proteins in the offspring.  These results suggested that maternal mild and severe ID impaired the development and maturation of cerebellar pinceau, which may be attributed to the decrease of AnkG, β4-spectrin, neurofascin 186, and NrCAM. And the alteration of development and maturation in cerebellar pinceau in the offspring were also observed following maternal marginal ID, which is slighter than that of mild ID.",

        "abstract": "We investigated the properties of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) derived from Trichoderma harzianum. The enzyme, comprised of 572 amino acids, shares high homology with PAF-AH proteins from T. koningii and other microbial species. The optimum enzymatic activity of PAF-AH occurred at pH 6 in the absence of Ca2+ and it localized in the cytoplasm, and we observed the upregulation of PAF-AH expression in response to carbon starvation and strong heat shock. Furthermore, PAF-AH knockout transformant growth occurred more slowly than wild type cells and over-expression strains grown in SM medium at 37°C and 42°C. In addition, PAF-AH expression significantly increased under a series of maize root induction assay. Eicosanoic acid and ergosterol levels decreased in the PAF-AH knockouts compared to wild type cells, as revealed by GC/MS analysis. We also determined stress responses mediated by PAF-AH were related to proteins HEX1, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, and cytochrome c. Finally, PAF-AH exhibited antagonistic activity against Rhizoctonia solani in plate confrontation assays. Our results indicate PAF-AH may play an important role in T. harzianum stress response and antagonism under diverse environmental conditions.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the impact of postoperative infectious complications on hepatocellular carcinoma following curative hepatectomy.We performed a retrospective analysis of 200 hepatocellular carcinoma patients who underwent hepatectomy at our institution between September 2003 and June 2011. The patients' demographics, clinicopathological characteristics and postoperative infectious complications were analyzed. The Clavien-Dindo classification was adopted to assess the severity of complications. The dynamic change in the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, defined as the absolute neutrophil count divided by the absolute lymphocyte count, after surgery was also investigated. The observation endpoints for this study were recurrence-free survival and overall survival of the patients. Statistical analysis of the survival curves was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. The prognostic value of each variable for predicting prognosis was assessed via multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. The cutoff score for each variable was selected based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided, and significance was set at P < 0.05.The median age of the patients was 49 years, and the majority of patients were male (86%) and had been infected with hepatitis B virus (86%). The 30-d postoperative infectious complication rate was 34.0% (n = 68). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that postoperative infection was significantly correlated with tumor recurrence (P < 0.001). The postoperative intra-abdominal infection group exhibited a worse prognosis than the non-intra-abdominal infection group (P < 0.001). A significantly increased incidence of postoperative intra-abdominal infection was observed in the patients with hepatic cirrhosis (P = 0.028), concomitant splenectomy (P = 0.007) or vascular invasion (P = 0.026). The patients who had an elevated postoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio change (> 1.643) clearly exhibited poorer recurrence-free survival than those who did not (P = 0.009), although no significant correlation was observed between overall survival and the change in the postoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Based on multivariate analysis, hepatitis B surface antigen positivity, Child-Turcotte-Pugh class B, an elevated postoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio change and intra-abdominal infection were significant predictors of poor recurrence-free survival. Hepatic cirrhosis, the maximal tumor diameter and intra-abdominal infection were significant predictors of overall survival.Postoperative intra-abdominal infection adversely affected oncologic outcomes, and the change in postoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was a good indicator of tumor recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma patients after curative hepatectomy.",

A transformation frequency of 5x10(-6) was achieved. Among 110 genetically stable T-DNA transformants of T. atroviride T23, two transformants, AMT-12 and AMT-28, confirmed by Southern blot analysis to have single-copy inserts of T-DNA, showed an increase in dichlorvos-degradation ability of more than 10% compared to that of the wild type, exhibited similar tolerance to the pesticide, but lower spore formation ability. Five transformants exhibited a reduction in degradation of more than 70%, exhibited wild-type spore formation, and tolerated up to 800 microg/mL of dichlorvos. The left-flanking sequence of the insertion site in AMT-12 was cloned as a 1845-bp fragment and shown to have 89% identity to the DNA from T. atroviride IMI 206040; however, the involvement of this DNA in dichlorvos degradation remains still to be determined. This study can promote both a more efficient isolation of DNA sequence flanking T-DNA integration site in T. atroviride mutants and a more rational utilization of these transformants in dichlorvos degradation.",

A total of 5382 differentially expressed genes were identified, highlighting the complex transcriptional changes of T. atroviride in response to dichlorvos stress. 137 genes were regulated by dichlorvos and hex1, encoding major facilitator superfamilies, cytochrome P450, glutathione-S-transferase, flavoprotein, Hsp70, Hsp90, etc. Pathway and expression analysis indicated that ABC transporters were affected by the disruption of hex1 gene and might play a vital role in the tolerance process. Expression patterns of seven selected ABC transporter genes were confirmed by qRT-PCR after exposure to dichlorvos for 2, 6 and 24 h.The present study provides insights into the genetic basis of dichlorvos tolerance in Trichoderma that may be exploited for further development of bioremediation or biocontrol agents.",

        "abstract": "The current study aimed to establish a novel nomogram to predict the overall survival of individual Chinese patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs). Furthermore, this study sought to externally validate this nomogram using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.The records of 1183 patients with GEP-NENs treated at five high-capacity institutions in China between 2005 and 2015 were retrospectively analysed. In addition, 10 236 GEP-NEN cases from the SEER database were included as an external validation set.A multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards (PHs) regression was performed, and a nomogram was constructed. Discrimination, calibration, and external validation were performed using the SEER data set. The multivariate Cox model indicated that age, tumour size, differentiation, lymph node metastases, and distant metastases were independent covariates associated with survival. With respect to the training set, the nomogram exhibited better discrimination power than TNM classification (Harrell's concordance index (C-index): 0.837 vs 0.784, P=0.006). Discrimination was also excellent and superior to that of TNM classification for the SEER-based validation set (C-index: 0.808 vs 0.717, P<0.001). The calibrated nomogram predicted a survival rate that closely corresponded to the actual survival rate.We developed a nomogram that predicted the 3- and 5-year overall survival rates of patients with GEP-NENs. Validation revealed excellent discrimination and calibration for this nomogram, suggesting that it exhibits satisfactory clinical utility that might improve individualised predictions of survival risks and lead to the creation of additional clinical therapies.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication: 26 September 2017; doi:10.1038/bjc.2017.315 www.bjcancer.com.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have proposed that the ASAP1 gene participates in regulating the adaptive immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. A GWAS study has reported that ASAP1 polymorphisms (rs4733781 and rs10956514) were associated with the risk of tuberculosis (TB) in Russians. But due to population heterogeneity, different races would have different causative polymorphisms, and the aim of this study was to investigate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ASAP1 gene and TB risk in Chinese population.A total of 7 SNPs in the ASAP1 gene were genotyped in 1115 Western Chinese Han and 914 Tibetan population using an improved multiplex ligation detection reaction (iMLDR) method. The associations of SNPs with TB risk and clinical phenotypes were determined based on the distributions of allelic frequencies and different genetic models. A meta-analysis was carried out to further assess the relationship between ASAP1 polymorphism and TB risk.Statistical comparisons of cases and controls after correction for multiple testing did not yield any significant associations with the risk of TB via analyses of a single locus, haplotype, and subgroup differences. Meta-analysis showed no evidence supporting association between rs10956514 and overall risk for TB. Subsequent analysis referring to the genotypes of SNPs in relationship to clinical phenotypes identified that rs4236749 was associated with different serum C-reactive protein levels, suggesting a role of this locus in influencing the inflammatory state of Western Chinese Han patients with TB.Our present data revealed that ASAP1 polymorphisms are unlikely to confer susceptibility to TB in the Western Chinese Han and Tibetan populations, which challenges the promising roles of the ASAP1 gene in the development of TB and highlights the importance of validating the association findings across ethnicities.",

        "abstract": "Prophylactic antiviral therapy is essential for lymphoma patients with high baseline HBV DNA who undergo cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, there are limited data on the optimal options. The present study was designed to compare the efficacy of prophylactic lamivudine (LAM) with lamivudine plus adefovir dipivoxil (LAM+ADV) in preventing hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in lymphoma with, pre-chemotherapy HBV DNA load ≥2000 IU/ml. We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 86 lymphoma patients with baseline HBV DNA load ≥2000 IU/ml during chemotherapy and received LAM or LAM+ADV as prophylaxis between January 1, 2008 and November 30, 2014 at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, China. Sixty-five patients received LAM and 21 received LAM+ADV. The rate was significantly lower in the LAM+ADV group compared with the LAM group for HBV reactivation (23.8% vs 55.4%; p = 0.012), while no difference was observed between the two groups in patients for HBV-related hepatitis (21.3% vs 33.3%; p   =  0.349), and chemotherapy disruption (10.9% vs 19.0%; p = 0.337). In a multivariate analysis of factors associated with HBV reactivation in these patients, LAM+ADV treatment and HBeAg negative were the independent protective factors. Therefore, LAM+ADV should be considered for antiviral prophylaxis in lymphoma patients with pre-chemotherapy HBV DNA load ≥2000 IU/ml. Further study is warranted to confirm these findings.",

The effects of phytoestrogens at various concentrations were evaluated by ELISA, with hCG as the positive control. The mRNA expression of P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) was analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR.Genistein at 0.1 micromol/L obviously promoted the secretion of testosterone and upregulated the mRNA level of P450scc. At a higher concentration of 5 micromol/L, however, both daidzein and genistein significantly inhibited the testosterone production of Leydig cells (P > 0.05).Genistein can promote the testosterone production of Leydig cells at a low concentration (0.1 micromol/L), but both daidzein and genistein can inhibit it at a higher concentration ( >5 micromol/L).",

        "abstract": "The inflammatory microenvironment serves an important function in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Peripheral blood lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), as a novel inflammatory biomarker combining an estimate of host immune homeostasis with the tumor microenvironment, has been identified to be a predictor of clinical outcomes in a number of malignancies. The present study aimed at investigating the prognostic value of LMR in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated advanced HCC. A total of 174 patients with HBV-associated advanced HCC, without fever or signs of infections, were analyzed. Clinicopathological parameters, including LMR, were evaluated to identify predictors of overall survival time. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed using Cox's proportional hazards model. A threshold value was determined using a time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve. Univariate and multivariate analysis identified LMR as an independent prognostic factor in overall survival (OS) time in patients with HBV-associated advanced HCC (P<0.05). The threshold value of LMR was 2.22. All patients were divided into either a low LMR group (≤2.22) or a high LMR group (>2.22). The OS time of the high LMR group was significantly longer compared with the low LMR group (P<0.001). Patients in the high LMR group exhibited a significantly increased 3-month and 6-month OS rate, compared with that of the patients within the low LMR group (P<0.001). An increased level of LMR was significantly associated with the presence of metastasis, ascites and increased tumor size (P<0.01). LMR is an independent prognostic factor of HBV-associated advanced HCC patients and an increased baseline LMR level indicates an improved prognosis.",

        "abstract": "Although the salt iodization programmes are taken to control iodine deficiency (ID), some regions are still suffering from marginal ID. During pregnancy, marginal ID frequently leads to subtle insufficiency of thyroid hormones, characterized as low serum T4 levels. Therefore, the present research was to explore the effects of maternal marginal ID exposure on dendritic arbor growth in the hippocampal CA1 region and the underlying mechanisms. We established Wistar rat models with ID diet during pregnancy and lactation. The overall daily iodine intakes of the rats were estimated as 7.0, 5.0 and 1.5 μg/day in the control, marginal ID and severe ID groups, respectively. To study the morphological alterations of pyramidal neurons, Golgi-Cox procedure was conducted in the hippocampus. Sholl analyses demonstrated a slight decrease in the total length and branching numbers of basal dendrites on postnatal day (PN) 7, PN14 and PN21 in marginal ID group relative to the controls. However, there was no overt morphological change observed in apical dendrites. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis indicated that phosphorylation of MAP2, stathmin and JNK1 was down-regulated in marginal ID group. We speculate that the pups treated with maternal marginal ID subjected to subtle changes in dendritic growth of CA1 pyramidal neurons, which may be associated with the dysregulation of MAP2 and stathmin in a JNK1-dependent manner.",

There is no standard of care for salvage regimens. Metronomic therapy offers a novel therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment endowed with an antiangiogenic effect. The aim of the present research was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and toxicity of metronomic administration of low-dose methotrexate and thalimomide in relapsed and refractory NHL. Methods: Data were collected from ninety-eight patients with the diagnosis of relapsed and refractory NHL who were admitted to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University from January 2009 to June 2013. The median age was 42 years (range, 14-78years).Of the ninety-eight patients treated, 28(28.6%) had follicular lymphoma; 17 (17.3 %) had marginal zone lymphoma; 35 (35.7 %) had diffuse large cell lymphoma; and 18 (18.3 %) had T-cell lymphoma.

        "abstract": "Several genome-wide association studies have revealed that HLA-DP/DQ, STAT4 and IL-28B associated with liver diseases. But because of population heterogeneity, different races would have different causative polymorphisms. Therefore, in this study, we included Chinese Tibetans and Uygurs to examine the roles of these genes on HBV natural clearance.A total of 1341 subjects including 908 Tibetans and 433 Uygurs were recruited. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were genotyped.HLA-DP/DQ polymorphisms associated with HBV natural clearance in both ethnicities (Tibetans, rs3077, OR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.46-0.82; rs9277535, OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.41-0.75; rs7453920, OR = 0.64, 95%CI = 0.47-0.85; Uygurs, rs3077, OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.24-0.96; rs9277535, OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.20-0.91; rs7453920, OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.39-0.99), whereas no significant association was observed between IL-28B with HBV natural clearance in neither ethnicities (P > 0.05). STAT4 rs7574865 seemed to be Tibetan specific in HBV natural clearance (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.58-0.99). Moreover, in Tibetan patients, HLA-DQ rs7453920 GG had a higher frequency in HBeAg positive patients (P = 0.032) and STAT4 rs7574865 GG genotype appeared more frequently in Genotype C virus infected patients (P = 0.005). In addition, Uygurs have higher frequencies of HLA-DP/DQ protective alleles (72.5% for rs3077, 76.6% for rs9277535 and 26.8% for rs7453920) than Tibetans (51.7% for rs3077, 52.5% for rs9277535 and 18.5% for rs7453920)(all P < 0.05), and a lower prevalence of HBV infection as previously reported.HLA-DP/DQ but not IL-28B polymorphisms correlate with HBV natural clearance, irrespective of race, and HLA-DP/DQ would be causative genes attributing to varying prevalence in different regions. STAT4 rs7574865 seemed to be population specific in Tibetans and it might synergistically interact with virus contributing to disease progression.",

        "abstract": "Proteomic approaches using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) were adopted to identify proteins from cucumber leaves differentially expressed in F_2 generation of cucumber. Nearly 500 proteins were reproducibly detected, including 39 specific proteins expressed in F_2 sensitive pool samples and 22 specific proteins expressed in resistance pool samples, 35 proteins were two-fold upper limit and 46 proteins were two-fold lower limit. Furthermore, analysis with MALDI-TOF-MASS showed that one important protein of disease resistance gene (SSP3110) identified in F_2 generation of cucumber associated with defensive reaction. Three proteins (SSP5412, SSP5513, SSP5710) related to respiration or photosynthesis were identified in F_2 resistant pool samples, and 14-3-3 brain protein homolog (SSP1411) was identified in F_2 sensitive pool samples. All those proteins were probably parts of network of resistance or development-related proteins. This study gives new insights into cucumber powdery mildew resistant response in cucumber leaves and demonstrates the power of the proteomic approach in plant biology studies. MS analysis of other protein spots is underway.",

We derive explicit lower bounds on the delay margin of second-order unstable delay systems achievable by PID control, which provide  a priori  the ranges of delay over which a second-order delay plant is guaranteed to be stabilizable by a PID controller, and more generally, by a finite-dimensional LTI controller. Analysis shows that our results are less conservative in most cases than lower bounds obtained elsewhere using more sophisticated and general LTI controllers.",

        "abstract": "G A A b st ra ct s these findings. The present study seeks to identify biologic differences in methylation among these three racial/ethnic groups. Methods: We performed an array-based study of aberrantly methylated loci in CRCs and neighboring normal tissue using HumanMethylation450 arrays (Illumina). Paired FFPE CRC samples (n=42) and neighboring normal tissue were obtained from the case records of the pathology department at the University of Miami Hospital and Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (Miami, FL). Samples were segregated into racial/ ethnic categories of black, Hispanic, and NHW and matched for age and stage. DNA was extracted from 10 micron thick colon tissue resection samples, with target enrichment, sequencing, and automated analysis performed using manufacturer protocols for the HumanMethylation450 array. Methylome-wide tumor vs. normal differential methylation was performed on each sample pair. Significantly methylated loci (FDRpu003c0.05) in ≥90% of samples in each ethnic group were prioritized, and overlap was sought between ethnic groups. Pathway and gene ontology analyses were conducted assuming a hypergeometric model with the MetaCore software. Results: 13 BNH, 18 Hispanic, and 11 NHW matched pairs of normal colon and CRC were included. 10 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were significant both within and across all ethnic groups. All DMRs were hypermethylated, previously shown to be hypermethylated in cell lines, and several (e.g., MDFI, RYR2, OPLAH) were identified as top hits from published independent genome-wide methylation analyses. 73, 329, and 2379 DMRs were unique to Black, Hispanic, and NHW groups, respectively. The CpG sites that were differentially methylated (both hypoand hyper-methylation) were localized to intragenic and intergenic regions. Pathway analyses revealed unique signatures of methylation targets between ethnic groups. In contrast to Black and Hispanic datasets, the colorectal cancer (general schema) pathway was significant (FDRpu003c0.05) only in NHW. Conclusions: These results confirm common CRC methylation signals independent of racial/ ethnic labels and also reveal potential racialand ethnic-specific CRC methylation signatures. Clarification of these findings may contribute to the understanding of the phenotypic differences observed in patients with CRC among these groups.",

The interaction between agents is modeled by a signed directed graph, where both cooperation and competition coexist within a group. The graph is allowed to be structurally unbalanced and its adjacency matrix is assumed to be eventually positive. Distributed control laws are proposed for several classes of graph topologies. Simulation examples are provided to illustrate the proposed control laws. Signed graph-based multi-agent systems provide models to opinion dynamics and social networks, and may also hold significance in further developing such internet search algorithms as PageRank to counter spamming websites.",

        "abstract": "Extensive studies have confirmed the efficacy of taxanes in combination with anthracycline-based chemotherapy on breast cancer. However, few studies have assessed the efficacy of weekly taxane–anthracycline regimens on locally advanced breast cancer. This study was to compare the efficacy and safety of a weekly taxane–anthracycline regimen with those of tri-weekly anthracycline-based regimen in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. Patients with locally advanced breast cancer were randomized to receive 4–6 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with tri-weekly 5-fluorouracil–epirubicin–cyclophosphamide (FEC) regimen or weekly paclitaxel–epirubicin (PE) regimen. The primary endpoint was the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate. Other endpoints included the clinical tumor response, breast-conserving surgery rate, and adverse events. Between March 2010 and September 2013, 293 patients were randomized to the FEC (n = 151) and PE (n = 142) arms. The overall clinical response rate was significantly higher in the PE arm than in the FEC arm (76.06% vs. 59.95%, P = 0.001). Consistently, the post-chemotherapy pathologic T and N stages were significantly lower in the PE arm than in the FEC arm (P u003c 0.001). However, the pCR rate was similar in the two arms (10.61% vs. 12.31%, P = 0.665). Overall, 36 (27.27%) patients in the FEC arm and 6 (35.28%) in the PE arm were qualified for breast-conserving surgery. Most adverse events were comparable in both arms, with more severe neutropenia in the PE arm than in the FEC arm (11.97% vs. 5.96%, P = 0.031). In patients with locally advanced breast cancer, weekly PE was not superior to FEC in terms of pCR. However, weekly PE has a higher response rate and superior down-staging effects. On this account, the PE regimen may be considered an alternative option for locally advanced breast cancer. Long-term follow-up data are needed to confirm the efficacy of this regimen on locally advanced breast cancer.

        "abstract": "Abstract   This paper provides a connection between stability radius and  L  σ -gain of positive systems. The  L  1 -,  L  2 -, and  L  ∞ -gains of an asymptotically stable positive system are characterized in terms of stability radii and useful bounds are derived. We show that the structured perturbations of a stable matrix can be regarded as a closed-loop system with unknown static output feedback, which makes it possible to obtain the main results of this paper. In particular, we use the closed-form expressions for stability radii of positive systems to compute the  L  σ -gains without resorting to solve optimization problems. We also show that positive stabilization with maximum stability radius can be considered as an  L  2 -gain minimization, which can be solved by LMI. This inherently achieves performance criterion and establishes a link to the reported LP formulations. A significant result of this paper is the unique commonality among the optimal state feedback gain matrices in obtaining  L  σ -gains of the stabilized system. Numerical examples are provided to support the theoretical results.",

        "abstract": "The majority of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergo trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE). However, the prognosis of HCC remains poor. In the present study, five staging systems were compared to predict the survival rate of patients with HCC undergoing TACE treatment. A total of 220 patients with HCC were examined according to the model to estimate survival for hepatocellular carcinoma (MESH), hepatoma arterial embolization prognostic score (HAP), modified HAP (mHAP), performance status combined Japan Integrated Staging system (PSJIS) and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging systems. The endpoints of the study were 3-month survival, 6-month survival, 1-year survival and overall survival (OS) rates. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that the area under the curve of MESH, HAP, mHAP, PSJIS and TNM was 0.858, 0.728, 0.690, 0.688 and 0.699, respectively, in predicting 3-month survival rates; 0.822, 0.747, 0.720, 0.722 and 0.715, respectively, in predicting 6-month survival rates and 0.725, 0.664, 0.672, 0.645 and 0.654, respectively, in predicting 1-year survival rates. Discriminatory ability, homogeneity, monotonicity and prognostic stratification ability was evaluated using a likelihood ratio test and Akaike information criterion values among the five staging systems, and revealed that the MESH system was the optimal prognostic staging system for HCC. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that the MESH system is the most accurate prognostic staging system of 3-month survival, 6-month survival, 1-year survival and OS rates among the five systems analyzed in patients with HCC who have received TACE treatment.",

In this study, compared with fresh samples, four different storing sample methods (frozen at -20℃, dried with silica ge1, stored with improved saturated NaCl-CTAB solution and cell nuclear segregation buffer ) for Betula Luminifera fruit leaves were evaluated. The effects of them were compared based on the yield, purity, molecular size distribution of the extracted DNA and existence of PCR-inhibitor. Results showed that DNA could not be extracted from the frozen sample, but the quality of DNAs extracted from preserved with improved saturated NaCl-CTAB solution and cell nuclear segregation buffer was same and high comparing to fresh leaves (contro1). The molecular weight was about 48Kb and the quantity was about 400?滋g/g fresh, and produced clear polymorphiepatterns amplified by PCR. DNA also could be extracted from silica gel-dried sample though the amount was low (51.2?滋g/g) and no clear and perfect polymorphiepatterns was found.",

Methods Female Wistar rats ( n = 28) after pregnancy were randomly divided into control group, hypothyroid group 1 and 2 and iodine-deficient group (7 in each group). From gestational day ( GD) 6 to postnatal day ( PN) 28,iodine-deficient group was administered with iodine-deficient diet and tap water; hypothyroid group 1 and 2 were administered 5 ppm and 15 ppm propylthiouracil ( PTU) in the drinking water and fed with normal diet. 5 pups from each group were sacrificed and intracardiac perfused in PN7,PN14 and PN21. Brains were removed,fixed and sectioned coronally. All sections were observed and analyzed the expression of calmodulin by immunohistochemistry in hippocampal CA1,CA3 and DG regions. Results In PN14 and PN21,the iodine deficiency and 15 ppm PTU-treatment significantly reduced calmodulin in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions (P < 0. 05),but not in DG region. In PN7,the positive products were scarcely observed in all regions and the expression was no significantly difference in all four groups.

CD₃+CD₅₆+NKT cells, which are a new type of cytotoxic cells, are mainly focused on anti-tumor effect in hematologic malignancy, however its cytotoxic effects on solid tumor are not clear. The aim of this study is to explore the clinical expression and significance of peripheral CD₃+CD₅₆+NKT cells and CD₃-CD₅₆+NK cells in patients with solid malignant tumors.Peripheral T cell subsets and CD₃+CD₅₆+NKT cells and CD₃-CD₅₆+NK cells in 118 patients with malignant tumors (55 lung cancers and 63 breast cancers) and 46 healthy volunteers were analysed by flow cytometer.Compared with healthy control, both peripheral CD₃+T lymphocytes and CD₃+CD₄+ T lymphocytes in patients with lung cancer or breast cancer significantly decreased, but CD₃+CD₈+T lymphocytes only increased significantly in patients with lung cancer (P < 0.01). Further analysis of CD₃+CD₅₆+NKT cells and CD₃-CD₅₆+NK cells indicated that there was difference between lung cancer group and breast cancer group. In patients with lung cancer CD₃+CD₈+T cells and CD₃+CD₅₆+NKT cells increased significantly, and in patients with breast cancer CD₃+CD₅₆+NKT cells and CD₃-CD₅₆+NK cells increased obviously.In patients with lung cancer or breast cancer, CD₃+CD₅₆+NKT cells play the important role in anti-tumor effects, however, the anti-tumor effects of CD₃+CD₈+CTL and CD₃-CD₅₆+ NK cells were different.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the value and usefulness of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnostics of small opacities and complications of silicosis in mine machinery manufacturing workers, compared to conventional radiograms. The diagnosis of silicosis is mainly based on the radiological findings of workers exposed to the dust causing lung fibrosis. However, on radiograms many parenchymal structures overlap, which limits the sensitivity and specificity of the method. Difficulties in accurate interpretation of conventional radiograms in silicosis also result from their relatively low resolution. We randomly selected 30 I period silicosis patients from 77 I period silicosis patients working at a mine machinery manufacturing company. Out of 1078 non-silicosis and 162 0+ period silicosis subjects, 30 non-silicosis and 30 0+ period silicosis subjects were randomly selected and matched with the 30 I period silicosis subjects by age (+/- 3.0 yr) and occupational exposure time (+/- 2.0 yr). Chest X-rays were taken at maximal inspiration. For the HRCT examination, the GE Somatom plus apparatus was used. Eight, five and six subjects were respectively diagnosed as 0+, I or I+ period silicosis based on HRCT among 90 subjects whose original diagnoses were non-silicosis, 0+ or I period silicosis based on radiography. The numbers of small opacities in HRCT scans were significantly higher than those seen in radiography in all lung zones (p<0.01). HRCT was more sensitive than radiography in detecting small opacities of mid-out zones of the lung, but no statistical significance was found between the two methods in the detection of small opacities of lower zones of the lung. A statistically significant increase in the detectability of bulla, emphysema, pleural, mediastinal and hilar changes was observed (p<0.05). HRCT might be more sensitive than radiography in detecting lung parenchymal changes suggestive of silicosis.",

        "abstract": "Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is an ubiquitous environmental contaminant because of its extensive use in plastics and its persistence. As an environmental endocrine disruptor, it is suspected to interfere with neurodevelopment in people. However, evidence of the effects of maternal DEHP exposure on cerebellar development in offspring is scarce. The objective of this study was to investigate maternal exposure to DEHP and its effect on apoptosis of cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) and related mechanisms. Pregnant Wistar rats were administrated DEHP (0, 30, 300 and 750 mg/kg/d) by gavage from gestational day (GD) 0 to postnatal day (PN) 21. Primary CGCs were also exposed to mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), the main metabolite of DEHP, for 24 h with concentrations of 0, 25, 100 and 250 µM. The CGCs of male offspring from 300 and 750 mg/kg/d DEHP exposure groups showed significantly increased apoptosis. In addition, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was inhibited in the male offspring of the 300 and 750 mg/kg/d DEHP exposure groups. However, effects on female pups were not obvious. Apoptosis was also elevated and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was inhibited after primary CGCs were exposed to MEHP. Furthermore, apoptosis was reduced after treatment with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activator, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1, and increased after treatment with LY294002, an inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. These results suggested that maternal DEHP exposure induced apoptosis in the CGCs of male pups via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and the apoptosis could be rescued by IGF1 and aggravated by LY294002.",

        "abstract": "Objective To develop a QuEChERS method combined with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for the determination of 20 kinds of fungicide residues (tricyclazole, quintozene, pyrimethanil, vinclozolin, chlorothalonil, triadimefon, penconazole, procymidone, triadimenol, paclobutrazol, isoprothiolane, imazalil, fludioxonil, flusilazole, myclobutanil, trifloxystrobin, propiconazol, prochloraz, fenbuconazole and difenoconazole) in vegetables and fruits. Methods Twenty kinds of fungicides residues were extracted from the samples (lettuce, hairy squash, grape and plum) with acetonitrile, and then detected by GC/MS with external standard method after being cleaned up with three sorbents (PSA 50.0 mg, Al2O3 50.0 mg and NH2 30.0 mg). Results The method showed a good linearity over the range of 0.025~0.250 mg/L with correlation coefficients of 0.9974~1.0000. The recoveries of fungicides, except Chlorothalonil, were in the range of 83%~112% with the spiked levels of 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg into four vegetables and fruits matrixes, and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were almost not more than 11.0%. The limits of detections (LODs) were in the range of 0.2~11.8 μg/kg, respectively. Conclusion The method is sensitive, rapid and simple, and can be used for the determination of 20 kinds of fungicides residues in vegetables and fruits.",

Here, we show that hippocampal apoptosis, synaptotagmin-1, and PSD-95 are involved in the synaptic impairment following developmental ID.Two developmental rat models were created by administrating dam rats with either iodine-deficient diet or propylthiouracil (PTU, 15 ppm)-added drinking water from gestational day 6 till postnatal day (PND) 28. Then, the apoptosis in the hippocampus was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay, and the levels of synaptotagmin-1 and PSD-95 were detected with western blot on PND14, PND21, and PND28.The results showed that apoptosis cells and activity of caspase3 were increased in the iodine-deficient and PTU-treatment rats (P < 0.05, respectively). The iodine-deficient and PTU-treatment pups showed significantly lower level of synaptotagmin-1 and PSD-95 in hippocampus than that of controls (P < 0.05, respectively).Developmental ID resulted in the increase and delay of cell apoptosis and the decrease of synaptotagmin-1 and PSD-95 in the hippocampus, which were implicated in the impairment of brain development.",

Towards this end, we examine the algebraic Riccati equation associated with Kalman filtering using analytic function theory and relate it to the Bode integral. This result may be interpreted as a generalization of the Kolmogorov–Szego formula to the nonstationary case. In addition, the integral characterization is applicable to Kalman filtering with correlated noises and that with intermittent observations as well.",

Methods The clinical data of 67 cases of mesh infection after prosthetic patch repair who were treated in Chao-Yang Hospital from Jan. 2011 to Jun. 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. Results All patients were treated with surgical operation successfully,including removing the infected mesh and surrounding tissues,primary suture,and a placement of wound drainage,without replacement of a new patch substitute. The hospital stay of the patients was 10-25 days with an average of 16 days. Of the 67 patients,51 patients got primary healed and the other 16 patients healed delayed after local dressing change due to the superficial infection following stitch removal. Sixty-six patients were followed-up for 6-24 months(average of 20 months)after operation without recurrence and complication, including seroma,wound infection,intestinal fistula,and postoperative pain. Conclusions The treatment of mesh infection after inguinal hernia repair is very complicated,but the primary suture repair and a placement of wound drainage after removing infected mesh with complete debridement is a effective therapy for it.",

        "abstract": "Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) is not generally considered to be a biomarker in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs), as the majority of pNETs present with a normal range of CA19-9. The present study aimed to evaluate the role of serum CA19-9 levels as a prognostic factor in a relatively large number of patients with pNETs. Consecutive patients were retrospectively collected from a single institution between June 2006 and February 2015. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve were used to select the cut-off values for the baseline CA19-9 levels. The primary end point was set as overall survival. Potential factors associated with the abnormal elevation of CA19-9 expression levels in pNETs were also investigated. The cut-off value for CA19-9 was 16 U/ml as determined by the ROC curve, and for the area under the ROC curve it was 0.68. In total, 32.7% of patients (51/156) had CA19-9 expression levels higher than the cut-off value. Univariate analysis demonstrated that CA19-9 >16 U/ml was an adverse prognostic factor for patients' overall survival. The CA19-9 >16 U/ml group had a statistically higher proportion of tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage III or IV, as compared with the CA19-9 ≤16 U/ml group. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate that CA19-9 is a prognostic biomarker of pNETs, one that may reflect its aggressiveness and severity.",

        "abstract": "Xylanolytic enzymes are widely used in processing industries, e.g., pulp and paper, food, livestock feeds, and textile. Furthermore, certain xylanotic enzymes have demonstrated the capability to improve the resistance and immunity of plants. Screening of high-yield microbial xylanolytic enzyme producers is significant for improving large-scale cost-effective xylanolytic enzyme production. This study provided new evidence of high-level xylanolytic enzyme production by a novel fungus, designated Leptosphaerulina chartarum SJTU59. Under laboratory conditions, L. chartarum SJTU59 produced xylanolytic enzymes of up to 17.566 U/mL (i.e., 878.307 U/g substrate). The enzyme solution was relatively stable over a wide range of pH (pH 3.0 to pH 9.0) and temperature (40°C to 65°C) while showing high resistance to the majority of metal ions tested. Composition analysis of the hydrolytic products of xylan showed sufficient degradation by xylanolytic enzymes from L. chartarum SJTU59, mainly the monosaccharide xylose, and a small amount of xylobiose were enzymatically produced; whereas in the presence of sufficient xylan substrates, mainly xylooligosaccharides, an emerging prebiotic used in food industry, were produced. In addition, the xylanolytic enzyme preparation from L. chartarum SJTU59 could initiate tissue necrosis and oxidative burst in tobacco leaves, which may be related to enhanced plant defense to adversity and disease. L. chartarum SJTU59 possessed a complex xylanolytic enzyme system, from which two novel endo-β-1,4-xylanases of the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 10, one novel endo-β-1,4-xylanase of the GH family 11, and one novel β-xylosidase of the GH family 43 were obtained via rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends. Given the high yield and stable properties of xylanolytic enzymes produced by L. chartarum SJTU59, future studies will be conducted to characterize the properties of individual xylanolytic enzymes from L. chartarum SJTU59. xylanolytic enzymes-encoding gene(s) of potential use for industrial and agricultural applications will be screened to construct genetically engineered strains.",

Fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry were used to measure the reduction in the production of the EGFR protein. Real-time PCR was used to detect the silencing of the EGFR gene level. Colony assay was adopted to measure the cellular proliferation and colony formation. A tumor burdened athymic nude mouse model was established to calculate the tumor growth inhibition rate.The dsRNA-EGFR was shown to be effective with a 71.3% down-regulation of EGFR protein production and 50.0% of silencing of EGFR gene. The dsRNA-EGFR significantly reduced colony numbers by 66.8% in vitro and inhibited the tumor growth in vivo. The tumor growth inhibition rate was 75.0%.The sequence specific dsRNA showed a blockbuster effect in downregulation of EGFR gene level and protein production, inhibition of the cellular proliferation and tumor growth.",

        "abstract": "In order to explore the molecular mechanisms of virulence and genetic variance of Curvularia lunata in maize, an ATMT (Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation) system was established in order to create a wide range of insertional transformants of C. lunata. Our results showed that the germinating conidia were the ideal starting material for transformation. Based on our optimised\n transformation condition, the transformation efficiency of C. lunata with T-DNA was improved greatly, and the average transformation frequency was as high as 84 ± 5 transformants per 1 × 106 germlings. Southern blotting results of 39 randomly-selected transformants showed a unique hybridisation pattern and predominant\n single-copy insertions. An ATMT library containing approximate 3000 transformants was generated, and four types of transformants\n were screened in terms of growth rate, sporulation, mycelial pigmentation, and toxin production in vitro. This library will be used to identify genes involved in the virulence of the pathogen.",

A newly developed scoring system combining albumin and bilirubin, called ALBI grade, aims to assess liver function objectively. In prognosis prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), The Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score is commonly used in clinical practice and includes Child-Pugh evaluation. We substituted ALBI grade for Child-Pugh grade to establish ALBI-CLIP system and conducted this study to validate the prognostic value of ALBI -CLIP in HBV-related HCC patients after TACE therapy. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed HBV-related HCC patients who received TACE therapy. Baseline data were collected and evaluated. Child-Pugh grade and ALBI grade were integrated into CLIP and ALBI-CLIP systems, respectively.

        "abstract": "Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), as a prevalent xenoestrogen endocrine disrupter, is omnipresent in the environment and commonly used in polyethylene plastic products. Although DEHP has potential adverse effects on multisystem organs, damage to the central nervous system is more significant. However, the consequences and mechanisms of DEHP exposure remain to be explored. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and related mechanisms of maternal DEHP exposure on dendritic development of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in a rat model. Pregnant Wistar rats were intragastrically administrated either vehicle or DEHP (30, 300, and 750 mg/kg/d) from gestation day 0 to postnatal day (PN) 21. The dendritic length and complexity of dendritic arbors' pattern in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus were measured using Golgi-Cox staining and Sholl analysis. The expression of dendritic development-related proteins was detected using western blot and immunofluorescence staining. DEHP-treated male but not female pups showed an obvious decrease in the total length and branching numbers of basal dendrites on PN7, PN14, and PN21. The phosphorylation of MAP2c, stathmin, and JNK1 in the male pup hippocampus was significantly decreased in DEHP treatment groups compared to controls. However, protein expression alteration in the hippocampus of female offspring was not observed. In summary, our study indicated that DEHP has a gender-specific negative impact on the dendritic growth of CA1 pyramidal neurons in male offspring of a rat model of DEHP exposure. The adverse impact may be related to the dysregulation of phosphorylated and total MAP2c and stathmin mediated by JNK1.",

        "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases are leading causes of disease burden in middle income countries. Little evidence exists to determine if the primary healthcare system can effectively manage non-communicable diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of hypertension and diabetes management by the primary healthcare system.We used individual level data from the 2009 National Basic Public Health Services System to assess the effectiveness of hypertension and diabetes interventions on fasting plasma glucose, and blood pressure. We analyzed the associations between fasting plasma glucose, systolic or diastolic blood pressure and risk factors. The estimated average intervention effect on data balanced with confounding variables was assessed.9543 individuals who had data for fasting plasma glucose, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were included in this analysis. This study included 6681 patients with hypertension and 2222 with diabetes. The intervention lowered mean fasting plasma glucose by 0.5 mmol/L (0.4-0.6), lowered mean systolic blood pressure by 3.5 mm Hg (3.2-3.7), and lowered diastolic blood pressure by 2.9 mm Hg (2.7-3.2). Individuals who received medicinal treatment had 1.3 mmHg (0.8 to 1.8, P<0.01) lower diastolic blood pressure and 0.6 mmol/L (0.5-0.8, P<0.01) lower fasting plasma glucose than those who did not receive medicine. Generalized linear model indicated that medicinal treatment and baseline systolic blood pressure were significant positive predictors of change in systolic blood pressure. Age, living in urban areas and diabetic complications were significant negative predictors of change for systolic blood pressure.The National Basic Public Health Services System in China using trained community healthcare workers and well-established guidelines can be effectively implement non-communicable disease prevention and management care paradigms.",

        "abstract": "Objective To summarize our experience in laparoscopic repair of huge abdominal incisional hernia with the assistance of a small incision.Methods From June 2008 to December 2009,we performed small-incision assisted laparoscopy on 15 patients with huge abdominal incisional hernia.The mean diameter of the hernia ring of the patients was(12.3±3.4) cm.After removing the hernial sac,reconstruction of the abdominal wall was carried out.Results The procedure was completed in all the 15 cases within a mean operation time of(123.3±15.9) min(100-150 min).The length of the small incision ranged from 5 to 8 cm with a mean of(6.0±0.9) cm.Hidden hernia was detected in 6 of the cases,and was repaired during the procedure.One patient was confirmed as having a serous cyst.After the operation,the patients was discharged from our hospital in 4 to 8 days with a mean of(5.3±1.2) days.One of the patients had postoperative pain for over three months but without incisional infection or injury to the intestine or other abdominal organs.We followed up the patients for(19.9±4.7) months(12-30 months),and found no recurrent cases.Conclusions Small-incision assisted laparoscopic repair is safe and effective for huge abdominal incisional hernia with less complications and good outcomes in abdominal reconstruction.",

By copolymerization of the monomer with acrylamide (AAm), a novel hydrogel, poly(AAm-co-MAH-β-CD) with pH and ionic strength sensitivities plus molecular inclusion function, was obtained by irradiating the aqueous solution mixture of AAm and MAH-β-CD with electron beam. The effect of the feed ratio of components and irradiation dose on the swelling and deswelling properties of the hydrogel was systematically studied. Swelling ratio of the hydrogel was tested under different environment of pH and ionic strength. The results indicate that the copolymer hydrogels did not show any noticeable change in swelling at lower pH (pH<5). However, they showed an abrupt increase in swelling at pH 5-8 due to the ionization of carboxyl groups.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This paper is devoted to stabilization problem of linear time-invariant (LTI) continuous-time systems under stochastic multiplicalive uncertainty and time-delay. In its full generality, we model the stochastic multiplicative uncertainty as a random process with a certain distribution. We assess the stability of system based on mean-square criteria. Our main contribution includes the fundamental condition, both necessary and sufficient, which insures that the single-input single-output systems (SISO) can be mean-square stabilized by output feedback. This condition provides explicitly a fundamental limit on mean-square staibilizability imposed by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the system’s unstable poles, nonminimum phase zeros and time-delay.",

        "abstract": "Curvularia lunata is an important maize foliar fungal pathogen that distributes widely in maize growing area in China. Genome sequencing of the pathogen will provide important information for globally understanding its virulence mechanism.We report the genome sequences of a highly virulent C. lunata strain. Phylogenomic analysis indicates that C. lunata was evolved from Bipolaris maydis (Cochliobolus heterostrophus). The highly virulent strain has a high potential to evolve into other pathogenic stains based on analyses on transposases and repeat-induced point mutations. C. lunata has a smaller proportion of secreted proteins as well as B. maydis than entomopathogenic fungi. C. lunata and B. maydis have a similar proportion of protein-encoding genes highly homologous to experimentally proven pathogenic genes from pathogen-host interaction database. However, relative to B. maydis, C. lunata possesses not only many expanded protein families including MFS transporters, G-protein coupled receptors, protein kinases and proteases for transport, signal transduction or degradation, but also many contracted families including cytochrome P450, lipases, glycoside hydrolases and polyketide synthases for detoxification, hydrolysis or secondary metabolites biosynthesis, which are expected to be crucial for the fungal survival in varied stress environments. Comparative transcriptome analysis between a lowly virulent C. lunata strain and its virulence-increased variant induced by resistant host selection reveals that the virulence increase of the pathogen is related to pathways of toxin and melanin biosynthesis in stress environments, and that the two pathways probably have some overlaps.The data will facilitate a full revelation of pathogenic mechanism and a better understanding of virulence differentiation of C. lunata.",

        "abstract": "The tolerance of Trichoderma species to organophosphorus pesticides is necessary for their application in the bioremediation of pesticide-polluted environments. In some cases, such a requirement is also key to the synergistic use of these fungi with chemical pesticides, aiming to broaden the scope of control targets to include both plant pathogens and insect pests. However, the mechanism of Trichoderma tolerance of organophosphorus pesticides remains unclear. To address this, we have analyzed the function of the putative dichlorvos-tolerance gene hex1 by knocking it out. The hex1-deleted mutant showed loss of Woronin bodies and decreased tolerance to the organophosphate, dichlorvos. Moreover, HEX1 localizes at the septal plugs in mycelium which may be involved in controlling intracellular movement of dichlorvos. hex1 thus is involved the tolerance to dichlorvos and the formation of Woronin bodies in Trichoderma atroviride.",

Trichoderma atroviride strain T23 was transformed with linearized plasmid pV2, conferring resistance to hygromycin B, in the presence of restriction enzyme used to linearize the plasmid. A total of 172 regeneration transformants were detected by successive inoculation for seven times subcultivation on fresh PDA plate containing hygromycin B. The plasmid was integrated stably into the chromosome DNA, which was confirmed by PCR and southern analysis. The difference between 172 transformants and the parent strain was confirmed in colonial color, sporulation and growth rate. The results showed that the significant difference appeared in above mentioned characters between transformants and parent strain is sporulation capability. Transformants TC6, TD5, TE7, TF1 and TK1 produced higher amounts of conidia than the parent strain T23. In addition, transformants TKland TC6 showed stronger inhibition to the growth rate of the cucumber wilt pathogen (Fusarium oxyporum) in vitro.",

This paper attempts to answer the question: What is the largest delay range within which a control protocol is able to achieve and maintain the consensus? We consider second-order agents with unstable poles, which communicate over an undirected network topology, and derive explicit bounds on the delay consensus margin. The results show that the consensuability robustness of such unstable agents depends on the pole locations of the agents, as well as on the eigenratio of the network graph.",

A fungal mutant of Trichoderma koningii, TkA8, constructed by restriction enzyme-mediated integration, has been verified to have a high cyanide degradation ability in our previous study. In this study, the mutant cells were entrapped in sodium-alginate (Na-alginate) immobilization beads to degrade cyanide and ferrocyanide in a liquid mineral medium. The results showed that the fungus in immobilization beads consisting of 3% Na-alginate and 3% CaCl2 could degrade cyanide more efficiently than a nonimmobilized fungal culture. For maximum degradation efficiency, the optimal ratio of Na-alginate and wet fungal biomass was 20:1 (m/m) and the initial pH was 6.5. In comparison, cell immobilization took at least 3 and 8 days earlier, respectively, to completely degrade cyanide and ferrocyanide. In addition, we showed that the immobilized beads could be easily recovered from the medium and reused for up to 5 batches without significant losses of fungal remediation abilities. The results of this study provide a promising alternative method for the large-scale remediation of soil or water systems from cyanide contamination.",

        "abstract": "Iodine deficiency (ID) during development results in dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) and affects psychomotor and motor function. It is worth noting that maternal mild and marginal ID tends to be the most common reason of preventable neurodevelopmental impairment, via a mechanism that has not been elucidated. Therefore, our aim was to study the effects of developmental mild and marginal ID on the differentiation of cerebellar granule cells (GCs) and investigate the activation of BMP-Smad1/5/8 signaling, which is crucial for the development and differentiation of cerebellum. Three developmental rat models were created by feeding dam rats with a diet deficient in iodine and deionized water supplemented with potassium iodide. Our results showed that different degrees of ID inhibited and delayed the differentiation of cerebellar GCs on postnatal day (PN) 7, PN14, and PN21. Moreover, mild and severe ID reduced the expression of BMP2 and p-Smad1/5/8, and increased the levels of Id2 on PN7, PN14, and PN21. However, marginal ID rarely altered expression of these proteins in the offspring. Our study supports the hypothesis that mild and severe ID during development inhibits the differentiation of cerebellar GCs, which may be ascribed to the down-regulation of BMP-Smad1/5/8 signaling and the overexpression of Id2. Furthermore, it was speculated that maternal marginal ID rarely affected the differentiation of cerebellar GCs in the offspring. ",

        "abstract": "Curvularia lunata is an important pathogen causing Curvularia leaf spot in maize. Significant pathogenic variation has been found in C. lunata. To better understand the mechanism of this phenomenon, we consecutively put the selective pressures of resistant maize population on C. lunata strain WS18 (low virulence) artificially. As a result, the virulence of this strain was significantly enhanced. Using 2DE, 12 up-regulated and four down-regulated proteins were identified in virulence-increased strain compared to WS18. Our analysis revealed that melanin synthesis-related proteins (Brn1, Brn2, and scytalone dehydratase) and stress tolerance-related proteins (HSP 70) directly involved in the potential virulence growth as crucial markers or factors in C. lunata. To validate 2DE results and screen differential genes at mRNA level, we constructed a subtracted cDNA library (tester: virulence-increased strain; driver: WS18). A total of 188 unigenes were obtained this way, of which 14 were indicators for the evolution of pathogen virulence. Brn1 and hsp genes exhibited similar expression patterns corresponding to proteins detected by 2DE. Overall, our results indicated that differential proteins or genes, being involved with melanin synthesis or tolerance response to stress, could be considered as hallmarks of virulence increase in C. lunata.",

Eleven individual variables were selected to investigate high risk factors of the third level of lymphatic metastasis in different conditions.Axillary nodes metastasis status (OR = 4.541, 95%CI:3.569-5.776), tumor site (OR = 1.437, 95%CI:1.029-2.007), external nodes involved (OR = 3.809, 95%CI:1.683-8.618) and estrogen receptor (OR = 0.740, 95%CI:0.569-0.964) were high risk factors of the third level of lymphatic metastasis. Further analysis found that it is prone to happen a metastasis, especially when the tumor with a size over 5 cm and located at the lateral quadrant. Negative estrogen receptor was a risk factor of the third level lymphatic metastasis along with the tumor stage.For preoperative tumor biopsy shows Negative estrogen receptor of tumor stage T3 and over stage T3 when considering suspicious lymph node metastasis or external tissues metastasis intraoperatively should take in account into third level axillary lymph node dissection actively.",

        "abstract": "Trichoderma harzianum is a plant-beneficial fungus that secretes small cysteine-rich proteins that induce plant defense responses; however, the molecular mechanism involved in this induction is largely unknown. Here, we report that the class II hydrophobin ThHyd1 acts as an elicitor of induced systemic resistance (ISR) in plants. Immunogold labeling and immunofluorescence revealed ThHyd1 localized on maize (Zea mays) root cell plasma membranes. To identify host plant protein interactors of Hyd1, we screened a maize B73 root cDNA library. ThHyd1 interacted directly with ubiquilin 1-like (UBL). Furthermore, the N-terminal fragment of UBL was primarily responsible for binding with Hyd1 and the eight-cysteine amino acid of Hyd1 participated in the protein-protein interactions. Hyd1 from T. harzianum (Thhyd1) and ubl from maize were co-expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana, they synergistically promoted plant resistance against Botrytis cinerea. RNA-sequencing analysis of global gene expression in maize leaves 24 hours after spraying with Curvularia lunata spore suspension showed that Thhyd1-induced systemic resistance was primarily associated with brassinosteroid signaling, likely mediated through BAK1. Jasmonate/ethylene (JA/ET) signaling was also involved to some extent in this response. Our results suggest that the Hyd1-UBL axis might play a key role in inducing systemic resistance as a result of Trichoderma-plant interactions.",

        "abstract": "Mutant T66 was isolated from 450 mutants (constructed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation method) of Trichoderma harzianum. Maize seeds coated with T66 were more susceptible to Curvularia lunata when compared with those coated with wild-type (WT) strain. The disease index of maize treated with T66 and WT were 62.5 and 42.1%, respectively. Further research showed T-DNA has inserted into the ORF of one gene, which resulted in the functional difference between WT and T66. The gene was cloned and named Thc6, which encodes a novel 327 amino acid protein. To investigate its function, we obtained knockout, complementation, and overexpression mutants of Thc6. Challenge inoculation studies suggested that the Thc6 overexpression mutant can reduce the disease index of maize inbred line Huangzao 4 against the leaf spot pathogen (C. lunata). Meanwhile, The Thc6 mutants were found to affect the resistance of maize inbred line Huangzao 4 against C. lunata by enhancing the activation of jasmonate-responsive genes expression. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data further confirmed that the concentration of jasmonate in the induced maize exhibits a parallel change tendency with the expression level of defense-related genes. Hence, the Thc6 gene could be participated in the induced resistance of maize inbred line Huangzao 4 against C. lunata infection through a jasmonic acid-dependent pathway.",

Subsection 2.1 of the full paper adopts a SupW type test method and derives its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis; the core of subsection 2.1 consists of Theorems 1 and 2 with proof. Subsection 2.2, using the residual-based moving block Bootstrap method, gives the asymptotic p-values. Some simulations given in section 3 examine the finite sample performance of our method. We present numerical results in Figs. 1 and 2, which are related to the U.S. treasury yield curve rates. For the U.S. treasury yield curve rates, smooth transition cointegration relationship is actually found.",

The immobilized conidia showed enhanced degradation abilities compared with immobilized or freely suspended mycelia. The immobilized cells kept good storage capacity and reusability. Dichlorvos was confirmed to be completely removed by mycelia of AMT-28 within 7 days using HPLC analysis. The dichlorvos degradation rates in auxotrophic Burk media varied and were significantly affected by nitrogen sources. There was no detectable biosorption and the removal of dichlorvos in AMT-28 was primarily attributed to a kind of Biomineralization process.",

The plasmid pV2 transformation was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis. Out of 21 transformants, 15 single-copied transformants (71.4%) were found. To compare enzyme activities of rhodanese and cyanide hydratase, T. atroviride T23, T. harzianum T21 and their transformants constructed by REMI previously were also included. Transformants TkB6 (0.173 micromols thiocyanate formed min(-1)mg protein(-1)) from T30 and TaK1 (0.174 micromols thiocyanate formed min(-1)mg protein(-1)) from T23 showed higher rhodanese activity than other transformants and their wild strains. TkA9 (5.53 micromols formamide formed h(-1)mg protein(-1)) from T30 and Th64 (5.35 micromols formamide formed h(-1)mg protein(-1)) from T21 had higher cyanide hydratase activity than other transformants and their wild strains.",

A multi-fractal theory was applied to extract fractal feature in the power spectrum of ship noise. The wavelet based multi-fractal formalism was used to compute the generalized dimension of multi-fractal measure in triadic Cantor set. The computed results agree well with theoretical values. To apply the formalism to power spectrum of ship noise, a definition of singular measure was proposed first. The singular measure was used to describe the multi-fractal features of ship noise and reflect completely the properties of target in frequency domain. The results of multi-fractal analysis for three classes of ship noise samples have shown that the multi-fractal features in power spectrum are very effective for classification.",

According to the dose of PTU in fed water, hypothyroid group was divided into 5 mg/L group and 15 mg/L group (7 in each). 5 pups from each group were sacrificed and perfused intracardially in PN7, PN14 and PN21. Brains were removed, fixed and sectioned coronally. All sections were observed and analyzed the protein exression of CaMK II by immunohistochemistry in the hippocampus CA1, CA3 and DG regions.Control group in CA1, CA3 and DG regions of the hippocampus had strong positive staining and the cytoplasm of neurons were filled with CaMK II. The distribution of the immune reaction product in hippocampus of 5 mg/L, 15 mg/L and iodine groups were in line with the control group, but the staining intensity as compared with the control group gradually decreased. In PN21 and PN14, integrated optical density average of CaMK II in CA1, CA3 and DG regions of the hippocampus in iodine deficient group [PN21: (26.05 +/- 4.98), (30.79 +/- 3.22), (26.40 +/- 2.63); PN14:(25.48 +/- 4.87), (44.17 +/- 5.91), (26.41 +/- 3.01)] and 15 mg/L groups [PN21: (17.02 +/- 2.68), (24.57 +/- 6.62), (20.18 +/- 4.05); PN14:(20.66 +/- 3.51), (34.94 +/- 5.09), (27.32 +/- 4.97)] were significantly lower than those of controls [PN21: (57.75 +/- 13.22), (65.03 +/- 6.20), (49.39 +/- 8.41), P < 0.05; PN14: (54.08 +/- 12.00), (71.04 +/- 5.07), (78.52 +/- 12.42), P < 0.05]. In PN7, integrated optical density average of CaMK II in CA1 region of the hippocampus in iodine deficient group (25.74 +/- 3.33) and 15 mg/L groups (26.89 +/- 5.25) were significantly lower than those of controls(40.53 +/- 3.65), P < 0.05.Iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism may decrease the protein expression of CaMK II.",

In this paper, time domain beamforming method is presented for UWB through-wall imaging applications. The propagating wave slows down, encounters refraction and is attenuated as it passes through the wall. Firstly, the travel time is calculated from the antenna to the target in closed form based on the refraction model. Next, the beamformer design is presented, which incorporates the wall effects. Finally, Finite-Difference Time-Domain is used to demonstrate the efficacy of beamforming method and the impact of incorrect estimates of the wall thickness and dielectric constant on performance is also considered.",

        "abstract": "Autophagy is a process that involves lysosomal degradations of cellular organelles and closely related to tumor occurrence and progression. However, its importance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was still controversial. Therefore, this study is aimed to address the clinicopathologic effect of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B) and Beclin-1, as autophagic markers, in HCC patients. Tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry was used to examine the expression of LC3B and another autophagy key regulator (Beclin-1) in 156 operable HCC patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis, chi-square test, and Spearman's correlation analysis were used to analyze correlation of LC3B and Beclin-1 and their influence on clinical characteristics and prognosis. We found that the expression level of LC3B was significantly associated with vascular invasion (P = 0.008), lymph node metastasis (P &amp;lt; 0.001), and Beclin-1 expression level (P &amp;lt; 0.001). However, LC3B was not related to other clinicopathological features, including hepatitis B virus infection, liver cirrhosis, tumor number, tumor size, pathology grade, and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. Besides, correlation between the expression of Beclin-1 and clinicopathological features were not identified. Survival analysis showed that patients with high LC3B expression had a poorer 5-year overall survival (OS) rate than those with low LC3B expression (high vs. low: 79.5 % vs. 20.5 %, P = 0.026). And high LC3B expression tended to be related with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (P = 0.074), whereas the expression level of Beclin-1 did not show statistically significant association with OS or PFS. Further multivariate analysis revealed that lymph node metastasis (P = 0.047) and LC3B expression level (P = 0.047) were independent factors to predict the prognosis of OS in all patients. Our study demonstrated that high expression of LC3B, correlated with vascular invasion and lymph node metastasis, might be a novel prognostic biomarker and would be a potential therapy target for HCC, especially in operable patients.",

However, Wnt pathway related lncRNAs are not systematically analyzed and detected in lung adenocarcinoma. We used a high-throughput microarray to compare the lncRNA expression profiles in LAD and corresponding normal tissue (NT) samples. Several candidate Wnt pathway related lncRNAs were verified by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. We found that 232 Wnt pathway related lncRNAs were obviously expressed (≥2-fold change) in lung adenocarcinoma samples and 13 Wnt pathway related lncRNAs were aberrantly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma compared with matched histologically normal lung tissues by qPCR. Among these, RP11-181G12.2 and RP11-89 K21.1 were the most aberrantly expressed lncRNAs. Our study ascertained the expression of Wnt pathway related lncRNAs in lung adenocarcinoma. The results revealed that many Wnt pathway related lncRNAs were differentially expressed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues, suggesting that they may play a key role in tumor development. ",

        "abstract": "Pre-activation of the retinoid signaling pathway by all-trans retinoic acid facilitates neuronal differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. Using protein/DNA based screening assays, we identified activator protein 2α as an important downstream target of all-trans retinoic acid. Although all-trans retinoic acid treatment significantly increased activator protein 2α transcriptional activity, it did not affect its expression. Inhibition of activator protein 2α with dominant-negative mutants reduced ATRA-induced differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into neurons and reversed its associated functional recovery of memory impairment in the cell-based treatment of a hypoxic-ischemic brain damage rat model. Dominant-negative mutants of activator protein 2α inhibited the expression of neuronal markers which were induced by retinoic acid receptor β activation. All-trans retinoic acid treatment increased phosphorylation of activator protein 2α and resulted in its nuclear translocation. This was blocked by siRNA-mediated knockdown of retinoic acid receptor β. Furthermore, we found that retinoic acid receptor β directly interacted with activator protein 2α. In summary, the regulation of all-trans retinoic acid on activator protein 2α transcriptional activity was mediated by activation of retinoic acid receptor β and subsequent phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of activator protein 2α. Our results strongly suggest that activator protein 2α transcriptional activity is essential for all-trans retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.",

        "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the diagnostic values of procalcitonin (PCT), C reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum amyloid A (SAA) in septic patients. Methods This study totally enrolled 390 patients who were admitted to West China Hospital, Sichuan University from March to November 2011 with septic manifestation. The patients were divided into sepsis group (n = 203) and non-sepsis group (n = 187) according to clinical infectious disease standard. PCT and IL-6 were measured by automatic electrochemiluminescence (ECL) analyser. CRP was measured by rate immunonephelometric analyser, SAA was measured by fixed time nephelometric method. The diagnostic powers of these four biomakers were constructed by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. Results There were statistically significant differences on the values of PCT, CRP, IL-6, SAA between sepsis group and non-sepsis group. PCT had an AUC value of 0.919 (P<0.05) which was higher than that of CRP, IL-6, and SAA (P< 0.05). CRP performed with an AUC of 0.755 (P<0.05), IL-6 with an AUC of 0.786 (P<0.05), and SAA with the lowest AUC of 0.645 (P<0.05). The combination AUC was 0.892(P<0.05) and there was no statistically significant difference when compared to PCT. As an early diagnostic indicator of sepsis, the cut-off value of PCT was 1.18 ng/mL, with sensitivity of 84.7%, specific of 83.4%, while Youden index was 0.681, positive predict value was 64.1%, negative predict value was 75.8%, positive likelihood ratio was 5.10, negative likelihood ratio was 0.18, respectively. A statistically significant difference was available on the value of PCT in septic patients between ICU and non-ICU. Conclusion PCT as an early independent biomarker for sepsis is superior to immune inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, IL-6, SAA), also is better than the combination of these four biomarkers for economic effect.",

        "abstract": "This note addresses the problem of stabilizing a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) discrete-time linear time invariant (LTI) system over a MIMO additive noise channel. To treat this problem, we assume that the communication link between the plant output and the controller input consists of multiple additive colored mutually correlated noise channels subject to independent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraints. We derive analytical conditions for which mean square stabilization (MSS) can be achieved under such constraints. We also formulate numerical methods to test these conditions when the noise is white and correlated. Moreover, for simpler plant models, a characterization of the set of power constraints compatible with MSS is obtained. Our results show that the frequency response of the spectral factor related to the channel noise affects the minimum SNR for stability depending mostly on the unstable poles and their directions. This is aggravated by the existence of nonminimum phase zeros and higher relative degree of the plant. On the other hand, we detect that systems under highly correlated noise show lower SNR requirements for stability compared to ones with independent noise channels. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.",

        "abstract": "Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that the hippocampus contributes to the development of opioid dependence.However,the mechanisms underlying the role of the hippocampus in opioid dependence are to be determined.Here,we demonstrated that chronic exposure of mice to morphine for 10 days resulted in a significant attenuation of Na~+,K~+-ATPase activity via up-regulation of cAMP/PKA signal pathway.Given the previous findings that the depolarization of neurons induced by impairment of Na~+,K~+-ATPase activity is involved in the development of opioid dependence,these findings suggest that diminution of Na~+,K~+-ATPase mediated by up-regulated cAMP/PKA cascade may be a potential mechanism underlying opioid dependence.In addition,we also found that chronic morphine treatment led to a remarkable down-regulation of the protein level of three energy metabolism enzymes.The failure of conversion of glucose into ATP was also observed in the chronic morphine-treated but not acute morphine-treated mice hippocampus.Intra-hippocampal injection of D-glucose but not non-metabolizable sugar 3-O-methyl-glucose prior to morphine administration significantly suppressed naloxone-precipitated withdrawal jumping in acute morphine-treated mice.However,intra-hippocampal injection of glucose was unable to suppress naloxone-precipitated withdrawal jumping in chronic morphine-treated mice.These results demonstrated that the down-regulations of the hippocampal energy metabolism protein expression and impairment of glucose metabolism were also involved in the development of morphine dependence.",

        "abstract": "This paper concerns the delay margin achievable using proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems subject to variable, unknown time delays. The basic issue under investigation addresses the question: What is the largest range of time delay so that there exists a single PID controller to stabilize the delay plants within the entire range? Delay margin is a fundamental measure of robust stabilization against uncertain time delays and poses a fundamental, longstanding problem that remains open except in simple, isolated cases. In this paper, we develop explicit expressions of the exact delay margin and its upper bounds achievable by a PID controller for low-order delay systems, notably the first- and second-order unstable systems with unknown constant and possibly time-varying delays. The effect of nonminimum phase zeros is also examined. PID controllers have been extensively used to control and regulate industrial processes that are typically modeled by first- and second-order dynamics. While furnishing the fundamental limits of delay within which a PID controller may robustly stabilize a delay process, our results should also provide useful guidelines in tuning PID parameters and in the analytical design of PID controllers.",

        "abstract": "Microglia (MG) are the key cells involved in the innate immune response in the central nervous system, and their activation has been linked to inflammation and neurotoxicity by the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Recently, researchers have found that nonylphenol (NP), a ubiquitous endocrine disrupting chemical, could impair neurodevelopment and cognitive memory performance. However, whether NP affects the inflammatory responses of MG remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of NP on the inflammatory responses of BV2 MG and the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that NP increased the secretion of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β in BV2 MG. Increased phosphorylation of Akt, JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and decreased phosphorylation of ERK were observed in NP-treated MG. The inflammatory transcription factor activator protein 1 was also activated in NP-treated BV2 MG. These results suggest that NP may activate Akt/mitogen-activated protein kinase/activator protein 1 signaling in MG and subsequently increase IL-6 and IL-1β secretion.",

A generic anastrozole tablet was developed to offer an alternative to the marketed tablet formulation. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the bioequivalence between the test and reference formulations of anastrozole in a single-dose, 2-period, 2-sequence crossover study with a 14-day washout interval. A total of 20 healthy male Chinese volunteers were enrolled and completed the study, after oral administration of a single dose of 1.0-mg test and reference formulations of anastrozole. The blood samples were collected at different times and were determined by a fully validated high-pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. The evaluated pharmacokinetic parameters, including C , AUC , and AUC , were assessed for bioequivalence based on current guidelines. The observed pharmacokinetic parameters of anastrozole of the test drug were similar to those of the reference formulation. The 90% confidence intervals of test/reference ratios for C , AUC , and AUC were within the bioequivalence acceptance range of 80%-125%. The results obtained from these healthy Chinese subjects in this study suggest that the test formulation of anastrozole 1.0-mg tablet is bioequivalent to the reference formulation (Arimidex 1.0-mg tablet).",

        "abstract": "Model order reduction is an efficient technique to reduce the system complexity while producing a good approximation of the input-output behavior. However, the efficiency of reduction degrades as the number of ports increases, which remains a long-standing problem. The reason for the degradation is that existing approaches are based on a centralized framework, where each input-output pair is implicitly assumed to be equally interacted and the matrix-valued transfer function has to be assumed to be fully populated. In this paper, a decentralized model order reduction scheme is proposed, where a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system is decoupled into a number of subsystems and each subsystem corresponds to one output and several dominant inputs. The decoupling process is based on the relative gain array (RGA), which measures the degree of interaction of each input-output pair. Our experimental results on a number of interconnect circuits show that most of the input-output interactions are usually insignificant, which can lead to extremely compact models even for systems with massive ports. The reduction scheme is very amenable for parallel computing as each decoupled subsystem can be reduced independently.",

A series of factors are involved in the process of arterial calcification; however, the relationship between malnutrition and arterial calcification is still unclear.68 hemodialysis patients were enrolled in this study. Nutrition status was evaluated using modified quantitative subjective global assessment (MQSGA). Related serum biochemical parameters were measured. And the radial artery samples were collected during the arteriovenous fistula surgeries. Hematoxylin/eosin stain was used to observe the arterial structures while Alizarin red stain to observe calcified depositions and classify calcified degree. The expressions of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and matrix Gla protein (MGP) were detected by immunohistochemistry and western blot methods.66.18% hemodialysis patients were malnutrition. In hemodialysis patients, the calcified depositions were mainly located in the medial layer of the radial arteries and the expressions of BMP2 and MGP were both increased in the calcified areas. The levels of serum albumin were negatively associated with calcification score and the expressions of BMP2 and MGP. While MQSGA score, serum phosphorus and calcium × phosphorus product showed positive relationships with calcification score and the expressions of BMP2 and MGP.Malnutrition is prevalent in hemodialysis patients and is associated with arterial calcification and the expressions of BMP2 and MGP in calcified radial arteries. Malnutrition may be a new inducer candidate for arterial calcification in hemodialysis patients.",

There is a close relationship between VA deficiency (VAD) and the morbidity of diarrhea in the clinical setting. However, the regulatory mechanisms of VA are not clearly understood.Specific-pathogen-free Wistar rats received a diet with or without VA before gestation. The offspring were submitted to an abdominal injection of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. After the challenge, which lasted for 12 h, the serum retinol was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography, and the level of immunoglobulin A in the stool was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The lymphocyte immunophenotypes were evaluated with the use of flow cytometry with samples collected from the spleen, the mesenteric lymph nodes, Peyer patches, and intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes.Early life VAD, independent of the lipopolysaccharide challenge, significantly decreased serum retinol level and CD8(+) intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes. The level of immunoglobulin A secretion and percentages of splenic CD4(+)CD8(+) T cells were affected by the interaction effects of the lipopolysaccharide challenge and VAD treatment. Gestational VAD significantly increased the percentages of B cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes and decreased the percentages of CD11 C(+) dendritic cells and CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells from the Peyer patches. The lipopolysaccharide challenge only significantly increased percentages of splenic CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells. The intestinal tissue of the pups with VAD displayed mild inflammation.Gestational or early life VAD decreases the numbers of immune cells in offspring, which may partly suppress the activities of the mucosal immune responses in the intestine. This suggests that more attention should be given to the VA nutritional state of children and women of reproductive age.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate correlation of plasma Fib with routine prognostic factors of prostate cancer patients, including Gleason score, prostate specific antigen (PSA), TNM 7th Stage. Methods: From January 2007 to December 2012, 107 patients with prostate cancer and 44 cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were included in our study. Automated coagulation analyzer was used to determine the plasma fibrinogen levels. Results: The patients presented a mean age of 70.6 years, a mean PSA level of 28.73 ng/ml, clinically localized prostate cancer in 47 cases, locally advanced condition in 27cases, and distant metastatic disease in 33 cases. The fibrinogen levels were increased in cancer patients compared to that in patients with BPH (P = 0.031). Higher fibrinogen levels related to metastasis, higher TNM stage and increased PSA (p = 0.000, 0.041 and 0.004 respectively...",

According to the analysis of thin layer reflection wave, this paper presents a method using spectrum information to improve the vertical resolution of GPR. At first, the transmission model of electromagnetic wave in layered media is studied, and then the spectrum transmission function of GPR in four layers is built. The spectrum of the echo wave is fitted through computing the echo spectrums for different thickness layers. According to the fitting error curve, the thickness of the target layer can be picked up. This method avoids the shortcomings of traditional deconvolution method. Through processing the simulation data and experiment data, the effectiveness of this method in improving the vertical resolution of GPR is proved.",

        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with a particular control-oriented system identification problem recently considered by several authors. This problem has been referred to as the problem of worst-case system identification in H∞ in the literature. The formulation of this problem is worst-case/deterministic in nature. The available apriori information consists of a lower bound on the relative stability of the plant, an upper bound on a certain gain associated with the plant, and an upper bound on the noise level. The available aposteriori information consists-of a finite number of noisy plant point frequency response samples. The objective is to identify the plant transfer function in H∞ using the available apriori and aposteriori information. In this paper we resolve several important open issues pertaining to this problem. First, a method is presented for developing confidence that the available apriori information is correct. This method requires the solution of a certain nondifferentiable convex programming problem. Second, an essentially optimal identification algorithm is given for this problem. This algorithm is (worst-case strongy) optimal to within a factor of two. Finally, new upper and lower bounds on the optimal identification error for this problem are derived and used to estimate the identification error associated with the algorithm presented here. Interestingly, the development of each of the results described above draws heavily upon the classical Nevanlinna-Pick optimal interpolation theory. As such, the results of this paper establish a clear link between the areas of system identification and optimal interpolation theory.",

        "abstract": "Iodine is essential for the synthesis of triiodothyronine (T(3)) and thyroxine (T(4)). Iodine deficiency leads to inadequate thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones deficiency during brain development affects cognitive functions, such as attention, learning, and memory. However, the mechanism underlying these deficits is unclear. To investigate the role of iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism in synaptic plasticity, this study examined the induction of long-term synaptic plasticity (LTP) and expression of immediate early (IEA) gene proteins in rat hippocampus following congenital iodine deficiency or hypothyroidism. Through gestation and lactation, iodine-deficient or hypothyroid dam rats were administered with either iodine-deficient diet or methimazole-added drinking water. Exposure was terminated on postnatal day (PN) 30. In hippocampus of pup rats, the induction of LTP in area CA1 was determined on PN60 and the expression of c-fos and c-jun proteins was examined on PN20, PN30 and PN60. Compared to control pups, both treated groups have shown: (1) significantly lower concentrations of serum FT(3) and FT(4), (2) much smaller population spike (PS) amplitude (p<0.01) and field-excitatory postsynaptic potential (f-EPSP) slope induced by high-frequency stimulation (HFS) (P<0.01), and (3) significantly lower integrated optical density (IOD) total of c-fos and c-jun expression (P<0.05 or P<0.01). In summary, iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism during critical periods of brain development impair LTP induction and decrease the expression of c-fos and c-jun proteins in hippocampus.",

        "abstract": "Di (ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a commonly used phthalates (PAEs) compound as plasticizer and becomes a severe environmental pollutant worldwide. Studies show that DEHP, as an environmental endocrine disruptor, has potential adverse effects on human. Epidemiologic studies indicate that DEHP is positively correlated to allergic diseases. Maternal exposure to DEHP may contribute to the increasing incidence of allergic diseases in offspring. However, the role of DEHP and its detailed mechanism in allergic disease of the offspring are still unclear. The aim of our study is to investigate whether DEHP maternal exposure could aggravate the allergic responses in offspring and its mechanism. Pregnant Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups and exposed to different doses of DEHP. Half of the offspring were challenged with OVA after birth. All the pups of each group were sacrificed at postnatal day (PND)14, PND21 and PND28. The number of inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage was counted, lung pathological changes were observed, Th2 type cytokines expressions were checked, and the expression of TSLP signaling pathway were examined. Our results showed that maternal exposure to DEHP during pregnancy and lactation aggravated the eosinophils accumulation and the pathological inflammatory changes in pups' lung after OVA challenge. And maternal exposure to DEHP during pregnancy and lactation also elevated the levels of typical Th2 cytokines in OVA-challenged rats. What's more, maternal exposure to DEHP during pregnancy and lactation increased the levels of TSLP, TSLPR and IL-7R in the offspring after OVA challenge. Our study suggested that DEHP maternal exposure could aggravate the OVA-induced asthmatic responses in offspring. And this adjuvant effect of DEHP was related with the TSLP/TSLPR/IL-7R and its downstream signal pathways.",

In this paper, we propose a novel online one-class classification algorithm, online least squares one-class support vector machine (online LS-OC-SVM), combined with its sparsified version (sparse online LS-OC-SVM). LS-OC-SVM extracts a hyperplane as an optimal description of training objects in a regularized least squares sense. The online LS-OC-SVM learns a training set with a limited number of samples to provide a basic normal model, then updates the model through remaining data. In the sparse online scheme, the model complexity is controlled by the coherence criterion. The online LS-OC-SVM is adopted to handle the abnormal event detection problem. Each frame of the video is characterized by the covariance matrix descriptor encoding the moving information, then is classified into a normal or an abnormal frame. Experiments are conducted, on a two-dimensional synthetic distribution dataset and a benchmark video surveillance dataset, to demonstrate the promising results of the proposed online LS-OC-SVM method.",

        "abstract": "Silica inhalation can induce chronic lung inflammation and fibrosis. Upon silica stimulation, activated macrophages trigger the T-lymphocyte which can differentiate into many different types of Th cells, including the recently discovered Th17 cells. IL-17A, the typical Th17 cytokine, is reported in some inflammatory diseases. However, the role of IL-17A in silica-induced inflammatory response is still not clear. The regulatory mechanism of silica-induced Th17 response also needs to be investigated. So we established a mice primary cell coculture system (macrophage and lymphocyte) to investigate the role of IL-17A in silica-induced inflammatory response in vitro, by using anti-IL-17A mAb and IL-1Ra. Both anti-IL-17A mAb and IL-1Ra decreased the level of IL-17A and increased the function of Treg cells. The Th1 response was suppressed and the Th2 response was promoted by the addition of anti-IL-17A mAb or IL-1Ra. IL-1Ra treatment decreased the level of IL-6, whereas the levels of IL-23 and ROR- γ t were increased. Our study demonstrated that IL-17A reduction altered the pattern of silica-induced Th responses by boosting the function of Treg cells in vitro. Blocking the function of IL-1 signal pathway could suppress the level of IL-17A, which played the major role in modulating silica-induced Th responses in vitro.",

Peripheral blood LMR, as a novel inflammatory biomarker combining an estimate of host immune homeostasis and tumor microenvironment, has been found to be a predictor for clinical outcomes in various malignancies. There have been no reports regarding the prognostic value of LMR in advanced HCC until now. We want to investigate the prognostic value of LMR in patients with advanced HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: From September 2008 to June 2010, a total of 174 patients with HBV-associated advanced HCC without fever or signs of infections were analyzed. Clinicopathological parameters, including LMR, were evaluated to identify predictors of overall survival. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed, using the Cox proportional hazards model. The best cutoff was determined with time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve.

It is shown that the airlines of the three big aviation companies and Hainan airlines have formed multi-hub networks with high connectivity, while the other five companies only have single-hub or double-hub radial networks. The three big companies and Hainan airlines have apparent advantages of operational monopoly, and also intensive competition between them. Contrarily the other airline companies stand in apparent inferior competitive positions on the crucial airlines constituting Chinese civil aviation transport networks. The research is expected beneficial to airline and flight adjustment, code sharing and civil aviation policy enaction.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) was newly identified as a hepatitis B virus (HBV) receptor, which partly shed light on the reason for HBV hepatotropism and its host specificity. However, the related researches were limited to in vitro or animal experiments. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the association of NTCP polymorphisms with HBV natural course in humans.According to their serological and clinical characteristics, 933 Chinese Han individuals were divided into two major groups, 352 viral clearance controls and 581 persistently infected patients. The latter one included 186 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 395 non-HCC subjects. A total of five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected from HapMap dataset and genotyped by high resolution melting (HRM) curve method.The rs7154439 AA genotype was observed slightly more common in viral clearance group than in persistently infected group [16 (4.5%) subjects vs. 10 (1.7%) subjects. p=0.008, adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.15-0.75 in a codominant model; and p=0.006, AOR=0.32, 95% CI=0.14-0.72 in a recessive model]. While the rs4646287 AA genotype was observed slightly more frequent in HCC group than in non-HCC group [6 (3.2%) subjects vs. 1 (0.3%) subject. p=0.018, AOR=15.74, 95% CI=1.59-155.54 in a codominant model; and p=0.018, AOR=15.91, 95% CI=1.61-157.01 in a recessive model]. There were no statistically significant differences of allele or haplotype distribution between any two groups.This study suggests that polymorphisms in the NTCP region may be associated with the natural course of HBV infection. The rs7154439 AA genotype was associated with HBV clearance, while the rs4646287 AA genotype was associated with HCC occurrence. However, considering the sample size is relatively small, larger studies, especially through multicenter collaboration will be needed to fully validate the significance of these findings.",

A total of 609 patients with lung cancer were enrolled to allow factor comparison using Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney test or the Chi-square test. Variables that were significantly related to the presence of nosocomial infection were selected as candidates for input into the final ANN model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the performance of the artificial neural network (ANN) model and logistic regression (LR) model. The prevalence of nosocomial infection from lung cancer in this entire study population was 20.1% (165/609), nosocomial infections occurring in sputum specimens (85.5%), followed by blood (6.73%), urine (6.0%) and pleural effusions (1.82%). It was shown that long term hospitalization (≥ 22 days, P= 0.000), poor clinical stage (IIIb and IV stage, P=0.002), older age (≥ 61 year old, P=0.023), and use the hormones were linked to nosocomial infection and the ANN model consisted of these four factors .The artificial neural network model with variables consisting of age, clinical stage, time of hospitalization, and use of hormones should be useful for predicting nosocomial infection in lung cancer cases.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To study the effects of iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism on protein expression of extracellular signal-regulate kinase (ERK1/2) in the cerebellum of rats. Methods: Twenty-eight healthy Wistar rats, female, 60 days old, were randomly divided according to their body weight into control group, iodine deficient group and hypothyroidism groups. Hypothyroidism groups in accordance with drinking water containing propylthiouracil (PTU) were divided into doses of 5 mg/L and 15 mg/L groups, 7 rats in each group. Rats after pregnancy, iodine deficient rats were administered with iodine-deficient diet and hypothyroid rats were administered with PTU in drinking water. Pup's cerebellum in each group were weighed on day 14, 21, 28 and 42. Cerebellum tissue was observed for cerebellar morphology using silver staining and detected for ERK1/2 protein using immunohistochemistry on day 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42. Results: On day 14, 21, 28 and 42, cerebellum weight of pups from iodine-deficient [(0.0945 ± 0.0233), (0.1347 ± 0.0046), (0.1542 ± 0.0094), (0.1949 ± 0.0048)g] were significantly lighter than control [(0.1856 ± 0.0123), (0.2049 ± 0.0098), (0.2268 ± 0.0065), (0.2606 ± 0.0086)g, all P < 0.05] and hypothyroidism groups [for 5 mg/L group: (0.1741 ± 0.0172), (0.1927 ± 0.0103), (0.2181 ± 0.0064), (0.2583 ± 0.0054)g, all P < 0.05; for 15 mg/L group: (0.1604 ± 0.0083), (0.1682 ± 0.0103), (0.1996 ± 0.0073) and (0.2579 ± 0.0067)g, all P < 0.05] the difference had statistical significance (F = 6.325, 8.870, 16.191 and 21.574, all P < 0.05). Compared to the controls on day 7, iodine-deficient group didn't have clear layers; on day 21, disappearance of external granule cells from iodine-deficient and 15 mg/L groups was delayed, still two or three layer external granule cells remained; on day 28 and 42, molecular layer from 5, 15 mg/L and iodine-deficient groups and became thinner. Immunohistochemistry showed that on day 7, there was no statistical difference of integrated optical density average of ERK1/2, in all the groups (F = 1.102, P > 0.05); on day 14, 21, 28 and 42, integrated optical density average of ERK1/2 in iodine-deficient group [(7.3245 ± 0.5070), (8.3606 ± 1.0683), (9.1217 ± 1.0402), (12.1587 ± 0.7581), all P < 0.01] and hypothyroidism groups [for 5 mg/L group: (11.4307 ± 1.5200), (14.919 ± 0.8497), (16.0082 ± 1.1130), (15.7721 ± 0.8293), all P < 0.01; for 15 mg/L group: (7.8538 ± 0.9775), (11.2461 ± 0.8138), (12.78 ± 1.3783), (13.0871 ± 1.1450), all P < 0.01] was significantly lower than those of controls [(16.2831 ± 0.5143), (20.2653 ± 0.9551), (22.7485 ± 1.0267), (22.1725 ± 0.9939), all P < 0.01], the difference having a statistical significance (F = 16.131, 13.543, 26.953, 41.583, all P < 0.01). Conclusions: Iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism during critical periods of brain development may change cerebellar morphology and down regulate the protein expression of ERK1/2, which may result in damage of cerebellum development.",

        "abstract": "A light brown spotted-leaf mutant of rice was isolated from an ethane methyl sulfonate (EMS)- induced IR64 mutant bank. The mutant, designated as lbsl1 (light brown spotted-leaf 1), displayed light brown spot in the whole growth period from the first leaf to the flag leaf under natural summer field conditions. Agronomic traits including plant height, growth duration, number of filled grains per panicle, seed-setting rate and 1000-grain weight of the mutant were significantly affected. Genetic analysis showed that the mutation was controlled by a single recessive gene, tentatively named lbsl1(t), which was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 6. By developing simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, the gene was finally delimited to an interval of 130 kb between markers RM586 and RM588. The lbsl1(t) gene is likely a novel rice spotted-leaf gene since no other similar genes have been identified near the chromosomal region. The genetic data and recombination populations provided will facilitate further fine-mapping and cloning of the gene.",

        "abstract": "In this two-part paper we study stabilization and optimal control of linear time-invariant systems with stochastic multiplicative uncertainties. We consider structured multiplicative perturbations, which, unlike in robust control theory, consist of static, zero-mean stochastic processes, and we assess the stability and performance of such systems using mean-square measures. While Part 2 of this paper tackles and solves optimal control problems under the mean-square criterion, Part 1 is devoted to the stabilizability problem. We develop fundamental conditions of mean-square stabilizability which ensure that an open-loop unstable system can be stabilized by output feedback in the mean-square sense. For single-input single-output systems, a general, explicit stabilizability condition is obtained. This condition, both necessary and sufficient, provides a fundamental limit imposed by the system's unstable poles, nonminimum phase zeros and time delay. For multi-input multi-output systems, we provide a complete, computationally efficient solution for minimum phase systems possibly containing time delays, in the form of a generalized eigenvalue problem readily solvable by means of linear matrix inequality optimization. Limiting cases and nonminimum phase plants are analyzed in depth for conceptual insights, revealing, among other things, how the directions of unstable poles and nonminimum phase zeros may affect mean-square stabilizability in MIMO systems. Other than their independent interest, stochastic multiplicative uncertainties have found utilities in modeling networked control systems pertaining to, e.g., packet drops, network delays, and fading. Our results herein lend solutions applicable to networked control problems addressing these issues.",

        "abstract": "Overexpression of enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), a key component of polycomb proteins, has been linked to aggressive tumor behavior in a variety of cancers. In vitro, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) transcriptionally activates EZH2 and promotes the progression of breast tumor initiating cells. Here, we characterized the clinicopathological effect of EZH2 and HIF-1α in 410 breast cancer patients. We examined EZH2 and HIF-1α expression using immunohistochemistry and western blotting. We found that EZH2 and HIF-1α were highly expressed in 99 (24.1%) and 272 (70.6%) patients, respectively. EZH2 overexpression was associated with lymphatic invasion (P=0.025), HER2 expression (P=0.005) and hypoxia (P<0.001). Overexpression of EZH2 predicted a poor 5-year overall survival (OS, 74.8 vs. 93.4%, P=0.001), disease-free survival (DFS, 72.2 vs. 88.6%, P=0.031), local failure-free survival (LFFS, 95.7 vs. 97.9%, P=0.045) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS, 75.4 vs. 90.5%, P=0.039). Multivariate analysis confirmed that EZH2 is an independent prognostic factor for OS, DFS and LFFS. Moreover, a positive correlation was identified between EZH2 and HIF-1α (r=0.299, P<0.001). Importantly, tumors coexpressing HIF-1α and EZH2 had a poorer OS (P=0.007). In conclusion, our study demonstrated that EZH2 is an independent negative prognostic biomarker for breast cancer. Tumors overexpressing HIF-1α and EZH2 are more prone to disease progression.",

Those data strongly supported that isozyme polymorphism could be indicators to reveal the pathogen diver- sity,however there was lack of evidence to show the correlation of isozyme spectrum with pathogen collec- tion location,therefore at least based those enzymes mentioned above,the change of isozymes was unable to represent the difference of pathogen adaptability to environment.The phenomenon was possibly associ- ated with the wider adaptability of the pathogen to environments or other physiological factors probably in- volved in the regulation of pathogen adaptability.",

We develop small-gain type mean-square stability conditions, by first obtaining small-gain mean-square robust stability conditions for systems containing multiplicative stochastic uncertainties and next, reformulating the random delay stability problem as one of robust stability against such uncertainties. The results allow us to determine stability using mean square criteria on the variances of the system under random delays, ascertaining whether the system’s state variance matrix converges asymptotically to the zero matrix.",

Grade 3 disease was a significant factor associated with elevated serum PCT (OR, 9.24; 95%CI, 3.04-28.08; P<0.001). Serum PCT level was significantly decreased after treatment both in patients with stable disease (P=0.003) and patients with partial remission (P=0.001). In these patients, serum PCT level significantly increased again at the time of progression disease (P=0.001). Elevated serum PCT was a significant factor of worse survival (HR, 2.86; 95%CI, 1.36-6.03; P=0.006). Compared with patients with normal serum PCT and CgA level, patients with either PCT or CgA elevated and patients with both PCT and CgA elevated had progressively worse survival. Additionally, PCT expression in tumor cells was found in 24.0% of patients but did not correlate with other clinicopathological factors, including serum PCT.Serum PCT is elevated in part of patients with NENs of digestive system, especially in patients with grade 3 disease. Serum PCT level can help evaluate treatment response and its elevation indicates poor prognosis. Combination of serum PCT and CgA can improve outcome prediction.",

Previous study showed that Tregs regulate the process of silicosis by modulating the maintenance of immune homeostasis in the lung. Th17 cells share reciprocal developmental pathway with Tregs and play a pivotal role in the immunopathogenesis of many lung diseases by recruiting and activating neutrophils, but the regulatory function of Tregs on Th17 response in silica induced lung fibrosis remains to be explored.To evaluate the role of Th17 and IL-17 in the development of silicosis and their interaction with Tregs, Treg-depleted mice model was generated and exposed to silica to establish experimental model of silica-induced lung fibrosis. Here we showed that silica increased Th17 response in lung fibrosis. Tregs depletion enhanced the neutrophils accumulation and attenuated Th17 response in silica induced lung fibrosis. Both mRNA and protein results showed that Tregs exerted its modulatory function on Th17 cells and IL-17 by regulating TGF-β1 and IL-1β.Our study suggested that Tregs could promote Th17 cells differentiation by regulating TGF-β1 and IL-1β in silica induced lung fibrosis of mice, which further the understanding of the progress of silicosis and provide a new insight in the regulatory mechanism of Th17 by Tregs in lung inflammation.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of seven staging systems to predict 3- and 6-month and cumulative survival rates of patients with advanced hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Data were collected from 220 patients with HBV-associated HCC who did not receive any standard anticancer treatment. Participants were patients at The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from September 2008 to June 2010. The participants were classified according to the Chinese University Prognostic Index (CUPI), the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP), Japan Integrated Staging (JIS), China Integrated Score (CIS) systems, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC), Okuda and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging systems at the time of diagnosis and during patient follow-up. The sensitivity and specificity of the predictive value of each staging system for 3- and 6-month mortality were analyzed by relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis with a non-parametric test being used to compare the area under curve (AUC) of the ROC curves. In addition, log-rank tests and Kaplan-Meier estimator survival curves were applied to compare the overall survival rates of the patients with HCC defined as advanced using the various staging systems, and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) were used to evaluate the predictive value for overall survival in patients with advanced HCC. Using univariate and multivariate Cox's model analyses, the factors predictive of survival were also identified. A total of 220 patients with HBV-associated HCC were analyzed. Independent prognostic factors identified by multivariate analyses included tumor size, α-fetoprotein levels, blood urea nitrogen levels, the presence or absence of portal vein thrombus, Child-Pugh score and neutrophil count. When predicting 3-month survival, the AUCs of CLIP, CIS, CUPI, Okuda, TNM, JIS and BCLC were 0.806, 0.772, 0.751, 0.731, 0.643, 0.754 and 0.622, respectively. When predicting 6-month survival, the AUCs of CLIP, CIS, CUPI, Okuda, TNM, JIS and BCLC were 0.828, 0.729, 0.717, 0.692, 0.664, 0.746 and 0.575, respectively. For 3-month mortality, the prognostic value of CLIP ranked highest, followed by CIS; for 6-month mortality, the prognostic value of CLIP also ranked highest, followed by JIS. No significant difference between the AUCs of CLIP and CIS (P>0.05) in their predictive value for 3-month mortality was observed. The AUC of CLIP was significantly higher compared with that of the other staging systems (P<0.05) for predicting 6-month mortality. The χ(2) values from the LRTs of CLIP, CIS, CUPI, Okuda, TNM, JIS and BCLC were 75.6, 48.4, 46.7, 36.0, 21.0, 46.8 and 7.24, respectively. The AIC values of CLIP, CIS, CUPI, Okuda, TNM, JIS and BCLC were 1601.5, 1632.3, 1629.9, 1641.1, 1654.8, 1627.4 and 1671.1, respectively. CLIP exhibited the highest χ(2) value and lowest AIC value, indicating that CLIP has the highest predictive value of cumulative survival rate. In the selected patients of the present study, CLIP was the staging system best able to predict 3- and 6-month and overall survival rates. CIS ranked second in predicting 3-month mortality.",

We present extensions to both the classical Poisson integral and Bode's sensitivity integral formulae. The main utility of these results is that they can be used to quantify design limitations that arise in multivariable discrete-time systems, due to such system characteristics as open-loop unstable poles and nonminimum-phase zeros, and to such design requirements as stability and bandwidth constraints. These formulae are similar to those for multivariable continuous-time systems obtained elsewhere, and they reveal that feedback design limitations depend on directionality properties of the sensitivity function, and on those of unstable poles and nonminimum-phase zeros in the open loop transfer function.",

        "abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to be involved in the development and progression of lung cancer. However, the roles of lncRNAs in lung cancer are not well understood.We used a high-throughput microarray to compare the lncRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiles in lung adenocarcinoma and normal tissue (NT) samples. Several candidate adenocarcinoma-associated lncRNAs were verified by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Using abundant and varied probes, we were able to assess 30,586 lncRNAs and 26,109 mRNAs in our microarray. We found that 2,420 lncRNAs and 1,109 mRNAs were differentially expressed (≥2-fold change) in lung adenocarcinoma samples and NT, indicating that many lncRNAs were significantly upregulated or downregulated in lung adenocarcinoma. We also found, via quantitative PCR, that 19 lncRNAs were aberrantly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma compared with matched histologically normal lung tissues. Among these, LOC100132354 and RPLP0P2 were the most aberrantly expressed lncRNAs, as estimated by quantitative PCR in 100 pairs of lung adenocarcinoma and NT samples.Our study ascertained the expression patterns of lncRNAs in lung adenocarcinoma by microarray. The results revealed that many lncRNAs were differentially expressed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and NT, suggesting that they may play a key role in tumor development.",

Due to the inherent physical characteristics of systems usually under investigation, non-negativity is a desired constraint that can be imposed on the parameters to estimate. In this paper, we propose a general method for system identification under non-negativity constraints. We derive additive and multiplicative weight update algorithms, based on (stochastic) gradient descent of mean-square error or Kullback-Leibler divergence. Experiments are conducted to validate the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "We investigated the clinical roles and biological function of long non-coding (lncRNA) RPLP0P2 in lung adenocarcinoma (LAD). The expression level of RPLP0P2 was estimated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in 57 pairs of LAD and NT samples and the relation of RPLP0P2 to clinical data of LAD patients was analyzed. We overexpressed RPLP0P2 based on the human LAD cell line A549 by lentivirus‑mediated technology, then oncological behavior change was observed of A549 cells and the change of mRNA level of LRRC10B and RPLP0P2 by qPCR. We found that RPLP0P2 expression was lower while LRRC10B mRNA level was higher in LAD than NT by qPCR. RPLP0P2 expression level was negative correlated to LRRC10B mRNA level (Pearson correlation =‑0.754, P=0.0021). The expression of RPLP0P2 in lymph node metastasis of LAD group was significantly lower than LAD without lymph node metastasis group. Survival analysis showed that survival time of high expression of RPLP0P2 was significantly longer than low RPLP0P2 level in LAD patients. After RPLP0P2 was overexpressed, the proliferation rate, adhesion ability, S phase and G2/M phase cells and LRRC10B mRNA significantly reduced, while apoptosis and G0/G1 phase cells obviously increased, but migration ability and invasion did not significantly change. Our study ascertained that low expression of RPLP0P2 in LAD is associated with poor prognosis and decreased proliferation and adhesion ability of tumor cells. LRRC10B may be a downstream gene regulated by RPLP0P2. ",

Aurora-a and HIF-1α expression were semi-quantitative evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 140 PDA. Among which, 76 patients from one institute acted as training set, and 64 cases from another two institutes were used as testing set to validate the prognostic effect of Aurora-a and HIF-1α. Results: We found that Aurora-a was high or sufficient expressed in tumor zone, whereas low-expressed in the normal adjacent epithelia. Moreover, Aurora-a high expression, classified by training set ROC analysis-generated cutoff score, predicted an inferior overall survival both in testing set and training set.

Electron microscopic examination also showed that alveolar walls became thickened and collagen fiber bundles were seen around bronchioles and small vessels in the carding groups after 12 months.

        "abstract": "A protocol for efficient Agrobacterium tumefaciens -mediated transformation (ATMT) of biocontrol fungus Trichoderma atroviride strain T23 was developed to construct mutants with improved dichlorvos-degradation ability. A transformation frequency of 5 × 10 −6 was achieved. Among 110 genetically stable T-DNA transformants of T . atroviride T23, two transformants, AMT-12 and AMT-28, confirmed by Southern blot analysis to have single-copy inserts of T-DNA, showed an increase in dichlorvos-degradation ability of more than 10% compared to that of the wild type, exhibited similar tolerance to the pesticide, but lower spore formation ability. Five transformants exhibited a reduction in degradation of more than 70%, exhibited wild-type spore formation, and tolerated up to 800 μg/mL of dichlorvos. The left-flanking sequence of the insertion site in AMT-12 was cloned as a 1845-bp fragment and shown to have 89% identity to the DNA from T . atroviride IMI 206040; however, the involvement of this DNA in dichlorvos degradation remains still to be determined. This study can promote both a more efficient isolation of DNA sequence flanking T-DNA integration site in T . atroviride mutants and a more rational utilization of these transformants in dichlorvos degradation. Keywords ATMT Trichoderma atroviride Dichlorvos Microbial degradation 1 Introduction Organophosphorus pesticides are one of the most widely used agricultural chemical globally and their consumption accounts for 34% of the total sales of the insecticides every year ( Singh and Walker, 2006 ). Dichlorvos (O-2, 2-dichlorovinyl-O, O-dimethyl phosphate, C 4 H 7 O 4 Cl 2 P) is an efficient broad-spectrum organophosphate pesticide with medium toxicity. In the past two decades, dichlorvos has been widely applied to control pests of plants, homes and grain depots. Since dichlorvos has a relatively high water solubility, it is frequently detected as a major organic pollutant in surface, coastal and even ground water ( Zhang et al., 2002; Li et al., 2005 ) and poses a threat to health ( Bolton-Warberg et al., 2007 ). Therefore, the development of innovative technologies for the rapid degradation of dichlorvos is highly desired. Some Trichoderma species have the ability to degrade organophosphorus pesticides, such as dichlorvos, chlorpyrifos and glyphosate. These Trichoderma strains were usually isolated from natural environments ( Fu and Guo, 2006; Zhang et al., 2006 ). Their isolation was often time-consuming and the degradation efficiencies of isolated strains were low. These shortcomings limited further investigation to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms of organophosphorus pesticides degradation by Trichoderma species. To date, twelve genes involved in degradation of organophosphorus compounds have been cloned including the organophosphorus-degrading gene, opd , from Pseudomonas diminuta ( Singh and Walker, 2006 ); however, the isolation of the corresponding genes to opd from Trichoderma species has not yet been reported. Agrobacterium tumefaciens -mediated transformation (ATMT) is one of the most frequently used methods for introducing exogenous DNA into filamentous fungi ( de Groot et al., 1998 ), this technique exhibits many intrinsic advantages including low copy number of DNA insertions, improved targeted integration and non-specific recipient cell types (spores, germlings and hyphal tissue) ( Meyer, 2008 ). Trichoderma atroviride has been extensively investigated due to its potential as a biological control agent. Zeilinger (2004) employed a modified ATMT method for the efficient disruption of two genes encoding signaling compounds of the T . atroviride strain P1. Comparison of the phenotypic and genetic stability of recombinant T . atroviride strain T11 generated by protoplast-mediated transformation and ATMT was conducted ( Cardoza et al., 2006 ). Recently, Tang et al. (2009) reported that T. atroviride strain T23 had the ability to degrade dichlorvos. Here, we describe an optimized ATMT procedure for T. atroviride strain T23 with the goal of obtaining transformants with improved dichlorvos-degradation capacity. Furthermore, an in vitro cloning method based on PCR technique was used to efficiently isolate the left-flanking sequence of the T-DNA integration site of targeted transformants. Overall, the aim was to facilitate the cloning of genes involved in degradation of dichlorvos in T . atroviride strain T23. 2 Methods 2.1 Strains and plasmids T . atroviride T23, isolated from cucumber rhizosphere in a vegetable field of Shenyang (China) was used for ATMT. The strain A . tumefaciens AGL-1 containing the binary vector pBHt1 ( Mullins et al., 2001 ), which has a hygromycin B-resistance gene ( hph ) driven by the Aspergillus nidulans gpd promoter and trp C terminator, was kindly provided by Prof. Jingao Dong (Hebei Agricultural University, China). 2.2 Transformation ATMT of strain T23 was based on previous protocols ( de Groot et al., 1998; Covert et al., 2001 ) with modifications. A fresh colony of A . tumefaciens strain AGL-1 containing pBHt1 was cultured at 28 °C for 2 d with shaking at 240 rpm in LB broth supplemented with 50 μg/mL kanamycin and 50 μg/mL streptomycin. The A . tumefaciens cells were collected by centrifugation and diluted to an optical density at 660 nm (OD 660 ) of 0.15 in liquid induction medium (IM) (g/L: K 2 HPO 4 , 1.45, KH 2 PO 4 , 2.5, NaCl, 0.15, MgSO 4 , 0.5, CaCl 2 , 0.066, FeSO 4 , 0.0008, NH 4 SO 4 , 0.5, glucose, 1.8, 40 mM 2-[N-morpholino] ethanesulfonic acid, pH 5.3, 0.5% glycerol (w/v), 200 M acetosyringone), and induced for 6–12 h at 28 °C with shaking. After growing on potato dextrose agar (PDA) for 5 d at 28 °C, conidia of strain T23 were collected and diluted to 10 7 spores/mL using a sterilized physiological saline solution. For co-incubation, 100 μL of the T23 conidia suspension was mixed with an equal volume of A . tumefaciens cells, spread on the surface of a round cellophane paper, and placed horizontally on IM plates containing the ingredients of liquid IM medium except for 5 mM instead of 10 mM glucose and 15 g/L agar. The cells were co-cultivated at 25 °C in the dark. After 2 d, the cellophane paper was transferred to solid M-100 medium ( Stevens, 1974 ) supplemented with 300 μg/mL cefotaxime to inhibit growth of A . tumefaciens cells and 300 μg/mL hygromycin B as the selection agent for fungal transformants. Putative transformants formed within 3–7 d, the colonies were then transferred to M-100 plates that contained 300 μg/mL hygromycin B and plates were incubated at 25 °C. A . tumefaciens AGL-1 without the binary vector was used as a negative control. 2.3 Mitotic stability of transformants To determine the mitotic stability, the putative transformants were cultured five consecutive times on M-100 plates without hygromycin B, and then transferred to M-100 plates containing hygromycin B (300 μg/mL). 2.4 PCR and Southern analyses The strain T23 and its T-DNA transformants were inoculated into 100 mL PD medium prepared by boiling 200 g of peeled, cubed potatoes in 500 mL of water for about 40 min, adjusting the filtrate to 1 L with water and addition of 20 g of glucose. The culture was incubated in a rotary shaker at 180 rpm for 3 d at 28 °C. The mycelia were collected by filtration through lens paper, rinsed twice with sterile water, and dehydrated overnight in a freeze dryer. Fungal genomic DNA was extracted from lyophilized mycelia using a CTAB method ( Sambrook et al., 1998 ). PCR analysis to detect the hph gene in putative transformants was performed. The forward primer HPH1 was 5′-CGACAGCGTCTCCGACCTGA-3′, and the reverse primer HPH2 was 5′-CGCCCAAGCTGCATCATCGAA-3′. The PCR amplification protocol consisted of an initial denaturing cycle of 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 2 min, with a final extension step at 72 °C for 8 min. Southern blot analysis was conducted as described by Tang et al. (2009) . The amplified PCR fragments (810 bp) of the hph gene were used as probes. Genomic DNA was digested with HindIII (37 °C, 12 h) or Bam HI (30 °C, 12 h). 40 μL of digested DNA were subjected to electrophoresis at 110 V for 5 min, and then at 80 V for 3 h in a 1.0% agarose gel. DNA was blotted onto Hybond N+ nylon membrane ( Sambrook et al., 1998 ). Purification and recovery of DNA probes were performed by using 3S spin DNA agarose gel purification kit (Shenergy Biocolor Co.). DNA labeling, hybridization and signal detection were conducted according to the manufacturer’s instructions (AmershamGene Images CDP-Star Detection Kit, UK). 2.5 Screening of transformants for dichlorvos degrading ability A catalytic spectrophotometric method ( Zhou et al., 1996 ) was used to determine dichlorvos concentration in medium. The calibration curve of dichlorvos degradation was made according to the following procedure. The reaction was performed in 10 mL colorimeter tube. The mix contained 3.5 mL of dichlorvos solutions at various concentrations (dissolved in ethanol to reach the final concentrations of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, and 200 μg/10 mL), 0.5 mL of Burk medium (g/L: KH 2 PO 4 , 0.8, K 2 HPO 4 , 0.2, CaSO 4 ·2H 2 O, 0.1, MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O, 0.2, (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 1.0, MnSO 4 , 0.01, FeSO 4 ·7H 2 O, 0.005, Na 2 MoO 4 ·2H 2 O, 0.0033, glucose, 1.0, pH 6.0), 1 mL of 0.2% (w/v) Benzedrine Hydrochloride (dissolved in 40% ethanol), 1 mL of 10% (w/v) sodium citrate, 2 mL of 10% (v/v) H 2 O 2 and 2 mL of 0.1% (w/v) tartaric acid. After thorough mixing, the solution was incubated in a waterbath at 70 °C for 15 min, and then cooled rapidly to room temperature with flowing water for 10 min. The optical density at 410 nm (OD 410 ) of these solutions was determined. The concentration of residual dichlorvos was measured. 2.6 Determination of dichlorvos degradation Fungal transformants and parent strain T23 were incubated in flasks containing 200 ml PD at 28 °C at 200 rpm for 2 d. Mycelia were collected by filtration through lens paper, suspended in 400 mL sterile water and dried under vacuum. Two grams of mycelia were transferred to a flask containing 300 μg mL −1 dichlorvos in 100 ml of Burk medium and incubated at 28 °C at 200 rpm for 2 d. A 1.5-mL aliquot of culture was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, and 0.5 ml of supernatant was mixed with 3.5 ml 95% (v/v) ethanol to determine the optical density at 410 nm (OD 410 ). The measured concentration of residual dichlorvos was assigned as C 1 . The blank control, which has no mycelia, was also analyzed in the same conditions, and its dichlorvos concentration was designated as C 0 . The degradation rate (%) of dichlorvos was tested by calculated using the formula ( C 0 − C 1 )/ C 0 × 100%. 2.7 Assessment of tolerance to dichlorvos Transformants with altered dichlorvos degradation ability were cultured twice, and a 6-mm mycelia plug of each transformant was transferred to a M-100 plate (5-cm diameter) containing dichlorvos. Growth inhibition of each transformant was tested by inoculating M-100 media supplemented with mycelia plugs different concentrations of dichlorvos (100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800 and 900 μg/mL). The mycelia were cultured at 28 °C for 4 d to confirm its highest tolerance to dichlorvos. 2.8 Morphological observation of transformants The transformants of T23 that exhibited improved or decreased dichlorvos degradation capability were subcultured twice on M-100 plates, and then 6-mm mycelial plugs of each transformant were transferred to M-100 plate (9-cm diameter). The growth diameter and morphology were recorded every 3 h. 2.9 Isolation of sequence flanking the inserted T-DNA in T. atroviride transformant To amplify the DNA flanking sequence of a T-DNA integration site in a T . atroviride transformant, a LA PCR™ in vitro Cloning Kit (TaKaRa Co.; Code No.: DRR015) was used. The experimental procedure was conducted according to the Manual supplied with the cloning kit. Briefly, genomic DNA was digested with the restriction enzyme HindIII followed by the ligation of HindIII cassette. The ligation product was used as template for the first PCR with cassette primer C1 and primer S1 of the known T-DNA insertion sequence. A second PCR was performed by using primers designed for inner sequences, cassette primer C2 and primer S2 of the known T-DNA sequence. The primer S1 was 5′-GCAAGGAATCGGTCAATACACTACATGGC-3′ and the primer S2 was 5′-GGTCTTGACCAACTCTATCAGAGCTTGGTTGAC-3′ in this study. This procedure allowed for specific amplification of the left-flanking sequence of the T-DNA integration site. Finally, the specific PCR product was recovered from the gel after electrophoresis, and ligated to pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa Co.) to obtain the flanking sequence. 3 Results 3.1 Optimization of conditions for A. tumefaciens -mediated transformation (ATMT) of T. atroviride An optimal concentration of hygromycin B for selecting transformants of T . atroviride strain T23 was determined according to the previous report by Zhong et al. (2007) . Conidia spread on plates containing more than 240 μg/mL of hygromycin B did not germinate at all (data not shown). The growth of mycelia was inhibited at the hygromycin B concentration of 300 μg/mL. Thus, 300 μg/ml of hygromycin B was effective and suitable for screening of T23 transformants. To establish the suitable concentration of Agrobacterium strain AGL-1 for transformation efficiency, different concentrations of AGL-1 cells were applied. The results showed that when the AGL-1 cells reached OD 660 of 0.8 to 0.9, the transform efficiency was the highest ( Table 1 ). 3.2 Mitotic stability of T-DNA transformants 186 putative transformants obtained using vector pBHt1 were repeatedly transferred to nonselective medium in order to investigate the mitotic stability of the integrated T-DNA. Following five rounds of growth on nonselective medium, clones were transferred to selective medium. The result revealed that 300 μg/mL of hygromycin B was a reliable selection concentration when performing ATMT of T . atroviride strain T23. All transformants obtained under these conditions had high mitotic stability ( Table 2 ). 110 positive transformants were acquired in this study. 3.3 PCR analysis of T23 transformants To confirm the presence of the hph gene in the hygromycin B-resistant colonies, PCR amplication was performed using genomic DNA from 10 randomly selected putative transformants. Using the HPH1 and HPH2 oligonucleotide primers specific to the hph gene, it was possible to amplify a PCR product of the expected size (810 bp) from all the transformants tested, suggesting that the hph gene had been successfully integrated into genome of the T . atroviride strain 23. 3.4 Determination of the ability of transformants to degrade dichlorvos The dichlorvos degradation rates of 110 transformants ranged from 15.6% to 68.6% as compared to 56.7% of the parent strain T23. Fourteen transformants displayed improved dichlorvos degradation capacity. Two transformants (AMT-12 and AMT-28) exhibited an increase in dichlorvos degradation of more than 10% over that of the wild type ( p = 0.01 in least significant different test). Forty five transformants showed a decrease in dichlorvos degradation ability; among them, five transformants, AMT-18, AMT-25, AMT-44, AMT-64 and AMT-92 exhibited a decrease of more than 70% compared with the parent strain T23. 3.5 Morphological characters of transformants with obvious changes in dichlorvos degradation ability Growth rate and spore producing ability of seven transformants that had exhibited obvious changes in dichlorvos degradation ability were observed in nonselective PDA medium. The transformants AMT-12 and AMT-28, which expressed improved dichlorvos degradation ability, displayed lower spore production, but the same growth rate as wild strain T23 on nonselective PDA plate; However, the five transformants AMT-18, AMT-25, AMT-44, AMT-64 and AMT-92 showed a two-fold increase in growth rate and increased spore production compared to strain T23 under the same conditions ( Fig. 1 ). Transformants AMT-12 and AMT-28 grew as well as the wild type in the presence of 200 μg/mL of dichlorvos, and transformants AMT-18, AMT-25, AMT-44, AMT-64 and AMT-92 could tolerate up to 800 μg/mL of dichlorvos. 3.6 Molecular analysis of transformants To confirm that T-DNA was randomly integrated into the T . atroviride chromosomal DNA, and to determine the copy number of the transforming T-DNA, Southern blot analysis was conducted for the seven transformants exhibiting obvious changes in dichlorvos degrading ability. Genomic DNA digested with the restriction endonuclease BamHI or XbaI was hybridized with labeled 810 bp hph fragment. Both restriction enzymes cut the T-DNA of pBHt1 once outside the hph gene. Southern blotting showed that the T-DNA of vector pBHt1 was inserted at different sites of the genome of the transformants tested. AMT-12 and AMT-28 were confirmed to be transformants with single-copied T-DNA integration. AMT-25 and AMT-44 had triple integration sites of T-DNA in genomic DNA and AMT-18, AMT-64 and AMT-92 had two integration sites. The negative control, parent strain T23 showed no hybridization signal ( Fig. 2 ). 3.7 Cloning of flanking sequence of T-DNA insertion in transformant The region flanking the T-DNA integration in the transformant AMT-12 was successfully amplified using the LA PCR in vitro cloning strategy. An 1845-bp long left-flanking sequence was obtained (GenBank accession number: GQ223798) and compared with genome databases available at NCBI website (BLASTN 2.2.20+, NCBI). The cloned sequence has 89% identity with the genomic DNA of T . atroviride strain IMI 206040. Since transformant AMT-12 exhibited a statistically significant increase in dichlorvos degradation ability, it is possible that the T-DNA insertion occurred in DNA involved in degradation of this compound. 4 Discussion 4.1 Option of screening concentration of hygromycin B for transformants Since A . tumefaciens -mediated transformation of filamentous fungi was first reported ( de Groot et al., 1998 ), the technique has been successfully applied to over sixty species of filamentous fungi ( Michielse et al., 2005 ). Factors influencing the efficiency of ATMT, such as the components of induction medium, the concentration of acetosyringone (AS) and the hours of co-incubation, have been investigated ( Mullins et al., 2001; Covert et al., 2001; Combier et al., 2003; McClelland et al., 2005 ). In this study, the transformation condition of T . atroviride was optimized based on the previous studies. In earlier studies ( Cardoza et al., 2006; Migheli et al., 1996 ), the resistant phenotype was gradually lost over time because of the loss of the integrated fragment during the growth of the fungal cells under no selective pressure. In an effort to select for stable transformants, we adopted a concentration of 300 μg/mL hygromycin B. Some researchers have applied a concentration inhibiting spore germination ( Zhong et al., 2007 ), but we found that the effective inhibition concentration of mycelia growth was suitable for screening transformants in this study. An efficiency of transformation of about 50 transformants per 10 7 spores for T . atroviride was obtained, this result was lower than the reports in other fungi ( dos Reis et al., 2004; Weld et al., 2006 ), but comparable with the previous results in T . atroviride ( Cardoza et al., 2006; Zeilinger, 2004 ). In summary, the established transformation system is effective for T . atroviride . The integration of T-DNA usually results in obvious changes in colony morphology including the sporulation pattern and growth rate of the transformants. In our study, some transformants showed varied growth rate and spore production, these effects have also been described for T . atroviride strain P1 by Zeilinger (2004) . 4.2 The dichlorvos degradation capacities of transformants To degrade dichlorvos, previous studies have concentrated on photodegradation ( Lu et al., 1999; Benoit-Marquié et al., 2004; Oancea and Oncescu, 2008 ). Some attempts have recently been made to investigate the microbial degradation of dichlorvos ( Tang et al., 2009; Oncescu et al., 2007; Fu and Guo, 2006 ). Our experiment confirmed that T. atroviride strain T23 has obvious dichlorvos degradation potential regardless of whether there was a carbon resource (i.e. glucose) in the medium. In the present work, we used ATMT that differed from traditional isolation method ( Zhang et al., 2005; Li et al., 2008 ) to obtain transformants of T . atroviride with improved dichlorvos degradation ability, about 13% transformants showed a statistically significant increase in dichlorvos degradation capacity. Tang et al. (2009) reported that 76% restriction enzyme-mediated transformants had displayed increased dichlorvos degradation ability compared to that of the parent strain T . atroviride T23, but they had not isolated the potentially related sequences involved in the degradation of dichlorvos. We have developed a system to isolate the left-flanking sequence of T-DNA integration site in T . atroviride . Furthermore, an 1845-bp long flanking sequence was successfully isolated from the transformant AMT-12. The cloned sequence had never been reported in the previous literatures. It showed an 89% identity to the DNA from T . atroviride IMI 206040. As for the isolation of right flanking sequence of integration site of T . atroviride transformants, thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction (TAIL-PCR) ( Liu and Huang, 1998; Blaise et al., 2007; Zhong et al., 2007 ), panhandle PCR ( Jones, 1995 ) or inverse PCR ( Betts et al., 2007 ) are applicable. Further investigation is needed to confirm the biological function of the cloned sequence. It is not difficult to understand that if the exogenous T-DNA has been integrated into the coding region of a dichlorvos-degrading gene or a positive regulator gene, the dichlorvos degrading ability of the resulted transformants will be influenced. To our knowledge, there are no previous studies on microbial degradation of organophosphorus pesticide using Agrobacterium -mediated transformation of T . atroviride T23. The cloning of the functional fragment or gene that involved in dichlorvos degradation will facilitate the application of T . atroviride strain T23 in the environmental bioremediation. 5 Conclusion Our study results prove that A. tumefaciens -mediated transformation (ATMT) is an efficient way to obtained abundant transformants of T . atroviride strain T23 with diverse dichlorvos degrading capabilities. Moreover, we have described a system to isolate left-flanking sequence of targeted transformants efficiently in T . atroviride strain T23. The technique of ATMT offers an opportunity to study the molecular basis of dichlorvos degradation of T . atroviride . The fungus will be developed to a genetically modified organism and be applied in organophosphorus pollutant bioremediation in the future.

        "abstract": "The geophysical research of seamounts and islands and other geomorphologic units of South China Sea(SCS) is of particular significance for revealing the geologic history of SCS,utilizing islands properly,solving the problem of resources shortness,constructing coastal defense and so on.But in the past,the number of lines of geophysical survey was not adequate to cover the whole SCS,and quality of these geophysical data was not as high as today because of technological limit.In recent years,new data of multibeam,gravity,magnetic and other marine geophysics with higher quality are surveyed and the lines of geophysical survey are dense around SCS.In this paper,new geophysical data of SCS by ship-survey,satellite-survey and aerial-survey from these years are integrated in order to reveal more reliable geophysical background of SCS.Here,diurnal variation data of onshore geomagnetic stations are used to calibrate the magnetic survey data in SCS.And new processing technology which has been tested in National High Technology Research and Development Program(\"863\" Program in China) is also adopted during our work.In our study,new result has been obtained for islands and seamounts from their geophysical and lithological data.That is,islands and seamounts can be divided into three kinds according to their different geophysical features and lithological properties: 1) The islands and seamounts which have high value of gravity anomaly,ΔZ⊥ magnetic anomaly,density and magnetism are mainly composed of basic extrusive rocks(mainly basalt);2) The islands and seamounts which have high value of gravity anomaly and low value of ΔZ⊥ magnetic anomaly are basically composed of granite and metamorphic rocks;3) The islands and seamounts which have high value of gravity anomaly and fluctuating value of ΔZ⊥ magnetic anomaly which means somewhere has high value but somewhere has low value are composed of granite,metamorphic rocks mixed with volcanic eruption rock.The regular distribution of seamounts in SCS indicates that the formation of SCS is probably related to differentiation of blocks of SCS.This is the first research achievement of the comprehensive research of islands and seamounts in SCS by combining their geophysical data with lithological data.",

        "abstract": "Vascular calcification (VC), characterized by hydroxyapatite crystal depositing in the vessel wall, is a common pathological condition shared by many chronic diseases and an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events. Recently, VC is regarded as an active, dynamic cell-mediated process, during which calcifying cell transition is critical. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), with a multidirectional differentiation ability and great potential for clinical application, play a duplex role in the VC process. MSCs facilitate VC mainly through osteogenic transformation and apoptosis. Meanwhile, several studies have reported the protective role of MSCs. Anti-inflammation, blockade of the BMP2 signal, downregulation of the Wnt signal, and antiapoptosis through paracrine signaling are possible mechanisms. This review displays the evidence both on the facilitating role and on the protective role of MSCs, then discusses the key factors determining this divergence.",

        "abstract": "To establish a Hep-2/5-Fu of human drug-resistant laryngeal carcinoma cell line, and to screen the possible drug resistance-associated genes.Hep-2/5-Fu of a human drug resistant laryngeal carcinoma cell line was induced by continuously exposing human laryngeal carcinoma cells to gradually increasing concentrations of 5-Fu. The growth law was observed and the growth curve was protracted. The drug resistance of Hep-2/5-Fu was measured by MTT assay and the drug resistant index RI was calculated. Genes expressed differentially between Hep-2/5-Fu and its parent cell line Hep-2 were screened using a gene chip, and several selected drug resistance associated genes were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).Compared with its parental cells, the drug resistance cell line had slower growth rate and larger size. The Hep-2/5-Fu cell line showed cross drug resistance to 5-Fu, cisplatin and vincristine. There were 1210 differentially expressed genes possibly associated with drug resistance by the gene chip screening method. The possible drug resistance-related genes included Cyclin D, IGF-BP3, CASP9, and CDK4/6. The expression of Cyclin D in the Hep-2/5-Fu cell line was 6.5997 times of that in the parent cell line. RT-PCR results were consistent with the gene chip results.The altered biological properties of Hep-2/5-Fu may be related to its drug resistance phenotype. Several genes, such as Cyclin D, are possibly involved in the mechanism of drug resistance in this cell line.",

        "abstract": "Objective To explore the effects of vitamin A combined with other micronutrients on the nutritional status in children. Methods According to the method of stratified random cluster sampling, three kindergartens were randomly selected out of 7 in the suburbs of Chongqing. A total of 350 preschool children who met the eligibility criteria, aged between 3-6 years old in the selected kindergartens, were randomly assigned to 3 treatment groups: the vitamin A group (A group), the vitamin A plus Zn group (AZ group), and the vitamin A supplementation with multiple micronutrients group (AMM group). The supplementation lasted for 6 months in the three groups. The height and weight of the participants were measured and the Z-score value was calculated before and after supplementation to evaluate the incidence of malnutrition. Serumvitamin A, Zn, Fe, Ca and hemoglobin levels were also measured before and after the intervention. A questionnaire survey of the general situation, family status and dietary habit of the children was performed before the supplementation; also the dietary nutrient intake of the children during intervention was investigated by a 24-hour dietary recall method. Results The 24-hour dietary recall results showed that vitamin A, Zn and Ca were inadequate in the diet of the 3-6 years old children in our study. Compared with before supplementation, the serum Zn and Fe levels were significantly different in the three groups 6 months after supplementation (all P<0.01), with the increment of Zn level in AZ group being significantly higher than that in the AMM group (P<0.05). The serum vitamin A level in AZ group and AMM group were significantly increased by (0.05±0.23) μmol/L and (0.09±0.28) μmol/L (P<0.05, P<0.01), respectively; however, the increase was (0.03±0.27) μ mol/L in A group (P>0.05). The increment of serum vitamin A in AMM group was significantly greater than those in A and AZ groups (all P<0.05); the increment of hemoglobin level in AMM group was also significantly greater than that in A group (P<0.05). Themalnutritions rateswere decreased in the A, AZ and AMM groups to different degrees, and the decreases were not significantly different between the three groups (P>0.05). Conclusion The effect of multiple micronutrient supplementation shows no significant difference on nutritional status in 3-6 aged children compared with the two micronutrient supplementations. Micronutrient supplement for children should be based on the main nutritional problems of them, and the best combination of nutrients should be chosen to improve nutrition and health status of children.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of industry and farm, fungi contamination widely exists in occupational environment. Inhalation of fungi-contaminated organic dust results in hypersensitivity pneumonitis. 1,3-β-Glucan is a major cell wall component of fungus and is considered as a biomarker of fungi exposure. Current studies showed that 1,3-β-glucan exposure induced lung inflammation, which involved uncontrolled T helper (Th) cell immune responses, such as Th1, Th2, Th17, and regulatory T cell (Treg). A recently identified IL-10-producing B cells (B10) was reported in regulating immune homeostasis. However, its regulatory role in hypersensitivity pneumonitis is still subject to debate. In our study, we comprehensively investigated the role of B10 and the relationship between B10 and Treg in 1,3-β-glucan-induced lung inflammation. Mice with insufficient B10 exhibited more inflammatory cells accumulation and severer pathological inflammatory changes. Insufficient B10 led to increasing Th1, Th2, and Th17 responses and restricted Treg function. Depletion of Treg before the onset of inflammation could suppress B10. Whereas, Treg depletion only at the late stage of inflammation failed to affect B10. Our study demonstrated that insufficient B10 aggravated the lung inflammation mediated by dynamic shifts in Th immune responses after 1,3-β-glucan exposure. The regulatory function of B10 on Th immune responses might be associated with Treg and IL-10. Treg could only interact with B10 at an early stage.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies the optimal control design problem for linear discrete-time systems with stochastic multiplicative uncertainties. These uncertainties are assumed to be present in the control inputs and modeled as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random processes. The optimal performance under study is defined in the mean-square sense, referred to as the mean-square optimal H 2 performance. It is shown that the mean-square optimal H 2 control problem via state feedback can be solved using a mean-square stabilizing solution to a modified algebraic Riccati equation (MARE). A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of this solution is presented, which constitutes a generalization of the solution to the classic optimal H 2 state feedback design problem, whereas the latter can be obtained by solving an algebraic Riccati equation (ARE). It is also proven that the optimal control design problem can be cast as an eigenvalue problem (EVP). For the output feedback case with possible input delays, we show that the mean-square optimal H 2 control problem also amounts to solving an MARE, when the plant has no nonminimum phase zeros from the inputs to the measurement outputs. That is, the global optimal solution is obtained by solving an MARE incorporating the delays. The implication is that in this case a separation principle still holds.",

        "abstract": "Silicosis is characterized by chronic lung inflammation and fibrosis, which are extremely harmful to human health. The pathogenesis of silicosis involves uncontrolled immune processes. Evidence supports that regulatory B cells (Bregs) produce negative regulatory cytokines, such as IL-10, which can negatively regulate immune responses in inflammation and autoimmune diseases. Our previous study found that IL-10-producing B cells were involved in the development of silica-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis of mice. However, little is known about the role of Bregs in silicosis patients (SP). In this study, we found that serum concentrations of IL-10 were significantly increased in SP by using protein array screening. We further determined that the frequency of IL-10-producing CD1dCD5 Bregs, not IL-10-producing non-B lymphocytes, was significantly higher in SP compared to subjects under surveillance (SS) and healthy workers (HW) by flow cytometry. We also found that regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) were significantly increased in SP. Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-12) and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) were not significantly different between SP, SS, and HW. Our study indicated that IL-10-producing CD1dCD5 Bregs might maintain Tregs and regulate Th1/Th2 polarization in SP, suggesting that IL-10-producing Bregs may play a critical role in modulating immune homeostasis in SP.",

Methods: Vector plasmid pHR'-pCMV-GFP containing GFP gene as a target gene, package construct pCMV- ΔR8.2 and an envelope plasmid pCMV-VSVG were co-transfected into 293T packaging cell line using Ca-P precipitation method. The viruses harvested from the supernatant were used to transfect 293T cells again. Then the GFP strongly expressing monoclone was selected with a clone ring and then passaged. After 12 passages, the cells were sent for FACS to convince the stability of the GFP expression. Besides, a GFP targeted RNA interference experiment was conducted to assure that this cell line could be used in gene expression regulation experiments. Results: A GFP stably expressing cell line G4 was established, in this cell line more than 99% of the cells expressed GFP, which was stable after at least 12 passages and could be efficiently downregulated by RNAi. Conclusion: These researches showed that the lentiviral vector was efficient to establish GFP expressing cell lines, and using this vector a GFP stably expressing cell line G4 was established, which could be used efficiently in gene regulation research.",

However, few researches have reported the association of Tim-3 genetic variants with susceptibility and progression of HBV infection. In this study, we focused on the association of Tim-3 polymorphisms with HBV infection, HBsAg seroclearance and hepatocellular carcinoma.A total of 800 subjects were involved in this study. Four groups were studied here, including HBV, HBsAg seroclearance, HBV-associated HCC and healthy controls. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Tim-3, rs246871, rs25855 and rs31223 were genotyped to analyze the association of Tim-3 polymorphisms with susceptibility and disease progression of HBV infection.Our study found that rs31223 and rs246871 were associated with disease progression of HBV infection, while none of the three SNPs was relevant to HBV susceptibility. The minor allele \"C\" of rs31223 was found to be associated with an increased probability of HBsAg seroclearance (P = 0.033) and genotype \"CC\" of rs246871 to be associated with an increased probability of HBV-associated HCC (P = 0.007). In accordance, haplotypic analysis of the three polymorphisms also showed that the haplotype block CGC* and TGC* were significantly associated with HBsAg seroclearance (P<0.05) while haplotype block CAT*, CGT*, TAC* and TGT* were significantly associated with HBV-associated HCC (all P<0.05).Genetic variants of Tim-3 have an important impact on disease progression of HBV infection. With specific Tim-3 polymorphisms, patients infected with HBV could be potential candidates of HCC and HBsAg seroclearance.",

        "abstract": "The clinical value of the detection Hanta virus antigenemia in Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in patients with Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome was evaluated. Samples from 32 cases with varying degrees of HFRS were subjected to quantitative detection for HV membrane antigen in PBMC by flow cytometry. The correlation between clinical severity and positive rates was analyzed. On the first day of onset of illness, positive PBMC rates were highly different from group to group (P<0.01), which suggested a close relationship between clinical severity and the positive rate. Dynamic observations showed that in the light and moderate groups, positive rates differed significantly from day to day. This was not the case in the severe group with no statistical significance between the 7th and 10th day(P>0.05), which implied a relatively slow rate of virus elimination. Quantitative analysis of HV antigen in PBMC by FCM is a promising method in early diagnosis, individualized therapy and in evaluating the prognosis of HFRS.",

In particular, we aim to minimize the Hinf- norm subject to allocation of the weights on the edges. The optimization problem is formulated with Linear-Matrix-Inequality constraints. As closely related to the first problem, we consider the definiteness of the weighted graph Laplacian matrix with negative edge weights. A necessary and sufficient condition, using effective resistance matrix, is derived to guarantee the positive semi-definiteness of the Laplacian matrix.",

        "abstract": "Analgesics such as morphine cause many side effects including addiction, but kappa-opioid receptor agonist can produce antinociception without morphine-like side effects. With the aim of developing new and potent analgesics with lower abuse potential, we studied the antinociceptive and physical dependent properties of a derivate of ICI-199441, an analogue of (-)U50,488H, named (2-(3,4-dichloro)-phenyl)-N-methyl-N-[(1S)-1-(2-isopropyl)-2-(1-(3-pyrrolinyl))ethyl] acetamides (LPK-26). LPK-26 showed a high affinity to kappa-opioid receptor with the Ki value of 0.64 nM and the low affinities to micro-opioid receptor and delta-opioid receptor with the Ki values of 1170 nM and >10,000 nM, respectively. It stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding to G-proteins with an EC50 value of 0.0094 nM. In vivo, LPK-26 was more potent than (-)U50,488H and morphine in analgesia, with the ED50 values of 0.049 mg/kg and 0.0084 mg/kg in hot plat and acetic acid writhing tests, respectively. Moreover, LPK-26 failed to induce physical dependence, but it could suppress naloxone-precipitated jumping in mice when given simultaneously with morphine. Taken together, our results show that LPK-26 is a novel selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist with highly potent antinociception effects and low physical dependence potential. It may be valuable for the development of analgesic and drug that can be used to reduce morphine-induced physical dependence.",

        "abstract": "1,3-β-Glucan was a major cell wall component of fungus. The existing studies showed that 1,3-β-glucan exposure could induce lung inflammation that involved both Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) played a critical role in regulating immune homeostasis by adjusting the Th1/Th2 balance. The role of Treg cells and regulatory mechanism in 1,3-β-glucan-induced lung inflammation is still unclear. In our study, mice were exposed to 1,3-β-glucan by intratracheal instillation. To investigate the role of Treg cells in response to 1,3-β-glucan, we generated Treg-depleted mice by intraperitoneal administration of anti-CD25 mAb. The Treg-depleted mice showed more inflammatory cells and severer pathological inflammatory change in lung tissue. Depletion of Treg cells led to increased Th1 cytokines and decreased Th2 cytokines. Treg-depleted mice showed a decreased expression of anti-inflammation cytokine and lower-level expression of CTLA-4. In all, our study indicated that Treg cells participated in regulating the 1,3-β-glucan-induced lung inflammation. Depletion of Treg cells aggravated the 1,3-β-glucan-induced lung inflammation, regulated the Th1/Th2 balance by enhancing Th1 response. Treg cells exerted their modulation function depending on both direct and indirect mechanism during the 1,3-β-glucan-induced lung inflammation.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to develop integral relations regarding the singular values of the sensitivity function in linear multivariable feedback systems. The main utility of these integral relations is that they can be used to quantify the fundamental limitations which arise due to system characteristics such as open loop unstable poles and nonminimum phase zeros, and those due to such fundamental design requirements as stability and bandwidth constraints. We present extensions to both the classical Bode sensitivity integral relation and its extension, and the classical Poisson integral formula. These extended integral relations exhibit important insights toward the tradeoffs that must be performed between the sensitivity reduction and increase due to the aforementioned system characteristics and design constraints. Most importantly, these integral relations display new phenomena concerning the design limitations in multivariable systems which have no analog in single-input single-output systems. The unique phenomena in multivariable systems are that the tradeoffs and limitations on the sensitivity design are related to the directionality properties of the sensitivity function, and to those of open loop unstable poles and nonminimum phase zeros, in addition to factors present in single-input single-output systems.",

Two developmental hypothyroid rat models were created with iodine-deficient diet (IDD) and water containing methimazole. Compared to the control group, in developmental hypothyroid rats: (i) HFS induced less in vivo LTP and more long-term depression (LTD) in area CA1 on postnatal day (PN) 60 (P < 0.0 5); (ii) in IDD pups, HFS-induced LTP showed much smaller population spike amplitude (P < 0.01) and slope of field-excitatory postsynaptic potential (P < 0.01); (iii) PKC activity, on PN30, was much higher on cell membrane and lower in cytosol (P < 0.05) without change of total PKC level (P > 0.05); and (iv) GAP-43 expression was significantly lower (P < 0.01) on both PN30 and PN60. Developmental iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism affect PKC translocation, decrease GAP-43 expression, and impair long-term synaptic plasticity in the rat hippocampus. © 2010 Maney Publishing.",

        "abstract": "During early pregnancy, iodine deficiency (ID) is linked to adverse effects on child motor and psychomotor function. Maternal marginal ID has become a common public health problem. It is unclear whether marginal ID influences the development of the cerebellum or its underlying mechanisms. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of marginal ID on the development of cerebellar Bergmann glial cells (BGs) and investigate the activation of the Notch signaling pathway, which is crucial for the development and morphology of BGs. We treated Wistar rats with an ID diet (iodine content 60 ± 1.5 ng/g) supplemented with deionized water containing different concentrations of potassium iodide (KI) (183, 117, and 0 μg/L for the control, marginal ID, and severe ID groups, respectively) during pregnancy and lactation. We explored the morphology of the BGs by Golgi-Cox staining and immunofluorescence and investigated the Notch signaling pathway using western blot. Our results showed that the marginal ID and severe ID groups had decreased cerebellar BG fiber lengths (P <  0.05 and 0.01, respectively) and numbers (P <  0.01 for both) on postnatal day (PN) 7, PN14, and PN21 compared to the control group. Moreover, the data showed that severe ID significantly reduced Dll1, Notch1, RBP-Jκ, and BLBP protein levels at all three time points. Marginal ID slightly reduced the expression of Notch1 on PN7 (P <  0.05) and PN21 (P <  0.01), RBP-Jκ on PN14 (P <  0.01) and PN21 (P <  0.05), and BLBP on PN7 (P <  0.05). There was no significant difference in Dll1 protein levels between the marginal ID and control groups at any time point. Our study suggests that marginal ID leads to mild damage to BG morphogenesis in the cerebellum. The abnormal regulation of the Notch signaling pathway may be involved in the damage to BGs.",

        "abstract": "In recent years,along with the rapid development of location technologies such as GPS,RFID and wireless sensor networks as well as the widespread use of location-aware devices such as mobile phones and GPS receivers,large amounts of trajectories of moving objects can be easily acquired.By using moving objects databases,massive trajectories of moving objects can be manipulated and handled for various applications,which makes the study of moving objects databases more and more important.Among the most recent researches,the study space where moving objects travel can be mainly divided into two types,the Euclidean space and the geographic road networks.In Euclidean space,moving objects can move freely.However,under geographic network environment,moving objects are limited to geographic networks and must follow the road regulation.For the latter research branch is much more practical than the former one,this paper concerns the latter branch and focuses on modeling moving objects in geographic networks,which is the foundation of the study of moving objects databases.It has been a hot research topic in the field of moving objects database management and also provides key technology for many other areas such as transportation,location-based services,urban mobility and social computing.Although it is of great theoretical significance and application value,modeling moving object in geographic networks challenges the research community a lot due to network constraints.In this paper,firstly,most existent geographic network-constrained moving object data models over recent decades has been systematically reviewed and classified.The related literatures show that most geographic network-constrained models can be divided into four categories including edge-based network-constrained model,route-based network-constrained model,partition-based network-constrained model and spatial-temporal network-constrained model.Then model characteristics,advantages as well as limitations have been elaborately analyzed,based on which,finally some crucial points on modeling moving objects in geographic networks has been proposed and discussed.",

        "abstract": "The interactions of sodium balance and response of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system are important for maintaining the hemodynamic stability in physiological conditions. However, the influence of short-term sodium intake intervention in the response of renin–angiotensin system (RAS) on hypertensive patients is still unclear. Thus, we conducted a clinical trial to investigate the effects of short-term sodium intake intervention on the response of RAS in hypertensive patients.One hundred twenty-five primary Chinese hypertensive patients were divided into high, moderate, and low sodium groups by 24-hour urinary sodium excretion (UNa+). All the patients received a 10-day dietary sodium intake intervention with standardized sodium (173.91mmol/day) and potassium (61.53mmol/day). Blood pressure, urinary sodium, urinary potassium, plasma sodium, potassium, creatinine, the levels of plasma renin activity, plasma angiotensin II concentrations (AT-II), and plasma aldosterone concentrations were detected before and after the intervention.Before the intervention, no differences were found in blood pressure and RAS among 3 groups. After standardized dietary sodium intake intervention, both UNa+ excretion and systolic pressure decreased in high-sodium group, while they increased in moderate and low-sodium groups. Intriguingly, there were no changes in the levels of plasma renin activity, AT-II, and plasma aldosterone concentrations among 3 groups during the intervention.The present study demonstrated that the influenced sodium excretion and blood pressure by short-term sodium intake intervention were independent of RAS quick response in Chinese hypertensive patients.",

        "abstract": "The proteomic approach is a powerful tool to study microbial response to environmental stress. To evaluate the responses of Trichoderma spp. to the organophosphate pesticide dichlorvos, mycelia of Trichoderma atroviride T23 were exposed to dichlorvos at concentrations of 0, 100, 300, 500, and 1000 microg/mL, respectively. Changes in protein expression were investigated using two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Sixteen protein spots were differentially expressed. They were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS and were found to be linked to energy metabolism, transport, signal transduction, and stress tolerance. Among stress-related proteins, glutathione peroxidase-like protein (GPX), 1,4-benzoquinone reductase, and HEX1 were upregulated by and cyclophilin A induced by 1000 microg/mL dichlorvos when compared with the control. These proteins were considered to be associated with fungal adaptation to adverse conditions. The results will help us to understand molecular mechanisms through which Trichoderma responds to organophosphate pesticides.",

This algorithm operates on available input and output data in the time domain and is constructed by solving an extended matrix tangential Caratheodory-Fejer problem. Similar to its counterpart for scalar systems, this interpolatory algorithm possesses certain desirable optimality properties and can be obtained via standard convex programming methods.",

        "abstract": "Silicosis is an occupational lung disease caused by inhalation of silica dust characterized by lung inflammation and fibrosis. Previous study showed that Th1 and Th2 cytokines are involved in silicosis, but Th1/Th2 polarization during the development of silicosis is still a matter of debate. Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) represent a crucial role in modulation of immune homeostasis by regulating Th1/Th2 polarization, but their possible implication in silicosis remains to be explored.To evaluate the implication of Treg cells in the development of silicosis, we generated the Treg-depleted mice model by administration of anti-CD25 mAbs and mice were exposed to silica by intratracheal instillation to establish experimental model of silica-induced lung fibrosis. The pathologic examinations show that the Treg-depleted mice are susceptive to severer inflammation in the early stage, with enhanced infiltration of inflammatory cells. Also, depletion of Treg cells causes a delay of the progress of silica-induced lung fibrosis in mice model. Further study of mRNA expression of cytokines reveals that depletion of Tregs leads to the increased production of Th1-cytokines and decreased production of Th2-cytokine. The Flow Cytometry and realtime PCR study show that Treg cells exert the modulation function both directly by expressing CTLA-4 at the inflammatory stage, and indirectly by secreting increasing amount of IL-10 and TGF-β during the fibrotic stage in silica-induced lung fibrosis.Our study suggests that depletion of Tregs may attenuate the progress of silica-induced lung fibrosis and enhance Th1 response and decelerate Th1/Th2 balance toward a Th2 phenotype in silica-induced lung fibrosis. The regulatory function of Treg cells may depend on direct mechanism and indirect mechanism during the inflammatory stage of silicosis.",

        "abstract": "Prognosis of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is under expectation. Life expectancy more than 3 months is one inclusion criteria for molecular targeted drugs in clinical trials. The main purpose of this research is to compare Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) and four MELD-based prognostic models in predicting the survival rate of advanced HCC patients. One hundred eighty-three patients with advanced HCC who were not amendable to standard anti-tumor therapy were retrospectively analyzed. Data were collected to classify patients according to MELD, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease with the incorporation of serum sodium (MELD-NA), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease to ascites and sodium (MELD-AS), integrated Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (iMELD), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease to sodium (MESO) scores at diagnosis. 1-, 3-, and 6-month survivals were the end points used in the analysis. When predicting 1-month survival, MELD-AS, MELD, and MESO were the top 3 ranking staging systems. When predicting 3-month survival, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of MELD-AS is significantly higher than that of the other models (P < 0.05). When predicting 6-month survival, AUCs of MELD-AS and MELD-NA are significantly higher than those of the other models (P < 0.05). Cutoff point of MELD-AS is 23.11 with 40.5 % sensitivity and 93.8 % specificity at 1 month, 9.5 with 76.9 % sensitivity and 59.5 % specificity at 3 months, and 18.5 with 27.0 % sensitivity and 89.1 % specificity at 6 months. MELD-based scores of death group are significantly higher than those of survivors within 1 and 3 months (P < 0.001). Independent prognostic factors identified by multivariate analysis included persistent ascites, serum sodium, and thrombosis. MELD-AS is the best model in the prediction of short and intermediate survival among the five models for end-stage liver disease analyzed for Chinese advanced HCC patients.",

Then we reviewed 15 article and used RevMan Software for analysis; the heterogeneity among the articles was determined to be high (chi2 = 191.65, P < 0.00001). When we analyzed the 5 articles wherein serum was used as the standard, we noticed homogeneity (chi2 = 6.97, P = 0.14). The summary sensitivity was 25%; the summary specificity was 80%; the area under the curve was 0.6279. Our study demonstrated that GPI exhibited high specificity and low sensitivity in diagnosing RA cases. We suggest that GPI be used in conjunction with some assay or other that is characterized by high sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "A modified Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation method was established for the construction of mutants with improved copper tolerance and accumulation capability in Trichoderma reesei. One transformant, AT01, exhibited the highest copper accumulation capability. With copper at 0.7 mM, AT01 removed 13 mg copper/g biomass (removal rate of 96%), whereas the wild-type strain removed only 6 mg copper/g biomass (removal rate of 50%). Optimal conditions were a pH of 5.0 at 28°C. The pigment change of Trichoderma mycelia was a potential indicator of copper accumulation. Electron microscopy revealed that copper was mainly accumulated in cell vacuoles.",

        "abstract": "Vitamin A is a critical micronutrient for regulating immunity in many organisms. Our previous study demonstrated that gestational or early-life vitamin A deficiency decreases the number of immune cells in offspring. The present study aims to test whether vitamin A supplementation can restore lymphocyte pools in vitamin A-deficient rats and thereby improve the function of their intestinal mucosa; furthermore, the study aimed to identify the best time frame for vitamin A supplementation. Vitamin A-deficient pregnant rats or their offspring were administered a low-dose of vitamin A daily for 7 days starting on gestational day 14 or postnatal day 1, day 14 or day 28. Serum retinol concentrations increased significantly in all four groups that received vitamin A supplementation, as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The intestinal levels of secretory immunoglobulin A and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor increased significantly with lipopolysaccharide challenge in the rats that received vitamin A supplementation starting on postnatal day 1. The rats in this group had higher numbers of CD8+ intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes, CD11C+ dendritic cells in the Peyer's patches and CD4+CD25+ T cells in the spleen compared with the vitamin A-deficient rats; flow cytometric analysis also demonstrated that vitamin A supplementation decreased the number of B cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes. Additionally, vitamin A supplementation during late gestation increased the numbers of CD8+ intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes and decreased the numbers of B lymphocytes in the mesenteric lymph nodes. However, no significant differences in lymphocyte levels were found between the rats in the other two vitamin A supplement groups and the vitamin A-deficient group. In conclusion, the best recovery of a subset of lymphocytes in the offspring of gestational vitamin A-deficient rats and the greatest improvement in the intestinal mucosal immune response are achieved when vitamin A supplementation occurs during the early postnatal period.",

        "abstract": "Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) widely used as a plasticizer in many materials. Epidemiological investigations have shown that DEHP exposure during early development is related to cerebellar-related adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, animal studies involving the effect of DEHP exposure on cerebellar development have rarely been reported and the potential mechanisms are unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of maternal DEHP exposure on the proliferation of cerebellar granule cell precursor cells (GCPs) and the mechanisms involved. Wistar rats were randomly assigned to four exposure groups and given 0, 30, 300, or 750 mg/kg/d DEHP by intragastric administration from gestational day (GD) 0 to postnatal day (PN) 21. Exposure to 300 and 750 mg/kg/d DEHP restrained GCPs proliferation and impaired neurodevelopment for males. Furthermore, exposure to 300 and 750 mg/kg/d DEHP decreased male pups protein expressions and mRNA levels of molecules related to proliferation, including Shh, Gli1, N-Myc, CyclinD1. In addition, the estrogen level and aromatase expression also reduced in male pups after maternal exposure to DEHP. However, effects on females were not obvious. These results suggested that 300 and 750 mg/kg/d DEHP exposure inhibit the proliferation of GCPs in male offspring and ultimately contribute to the impairment of neuromotor development. This, may be caused by the down-regulation of Shh signaling. And the susceptibility of male offspring to DEHP exposure may be attributed to the decreased estrogen level and aromatase expression in male pup's cerebellum.",

        "abstract": "38Background: A recent study indicated that Lectin-type oxidized LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) was a distinct surface marker for human polymorphonuclears myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSC). The present study was aimed to investigate the existence LOX-1 PMN-MDSC in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, the latent mechanism and their association with clinical parameters. Methods: 30 HCC patients and 30 health control were included. LOX-1+CD15+ PMN-MDSCs were investigated. Results: LOX-1+CD15+ PMN-MDSC were significantly elevated in both WB and PBMC of HCC patients compared with healthy control. LOX-1+CD15+ PMN-MDSC were more abundant in PBMC than WB. Addition of PMN-MDSCs resulted in significantly reduced proliferation and IFN-γ production of T cells with a dosage dependent manner. LOX-1-CD15+ PMNs present no suppressive function. The suppression on T cell proliferation and IFN-γ production was reversed by ROS inhibitor and Arginase inhibitor. ROS level of LOX-1+CD15+ PMN by DCFDA were higher in LOX-1+...",

        "abstract": "The aims were to access anxiety and type D personality (TDP) in parents of children with leukemia, and to determine the mediating effect of social support and coping style on the relationship between TDP and anxiety. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 231 parents of children with leukemia and 261 parents of children with acute diseases in hospitals. Parents completed questionnaires on anxiety, TDP, social support, coping styles, children's clinical characteristics, and demographic characteristics. Parents of children with leukemia showed higher prevalence of anxiety (64.5% vs 40.2%, P < 0.01) and TDP (44.2% vs 24.1%, P < 0.01) compared with controls. TDP (odds ratio [OR] = 4.34, P < 0.01), lower social support (OR = 1.92, P = 0.02), and less positive coping (OR = 1.87, P = 0.02) were independently associated with anxiety. Parents with TDP showed lower social support and less positive coping, but more negative coping compared with those without. Moreover, multiple mediation analyses revealed that the significant effect of TDP on anxiety was partially mediated by social support and positive coping. In conclusion, anxiety and TDP were highly prevalent in parents of children with leukemia. The predictive factors could be used to identify those parents who are at high risk of anxiety and may also be targets for prevention and intervention.",

        "abstract": "We aimed to unveil the clinical roles and biological function of lncRNA TUBA4B in on-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The relative expression level of TUBA4B was estimated by qPCR in 114 pairs of NSCLC and NT samples and the relation of TUBA4B to clinical data of NSCLC patients was analyzed. We found TUBA4B was lower expressed in NSCLC and five cell lines. The lower expression of TUBA4B was remarkably correlated with advanced TNM stage and lymph node metastasis and served as a predictor for overall survival of NSCLC. After overexpression of TUBA4B, cell proliferation ability of A549 and NCI-H1299 remarkably decreased. Our study ascertained low expression TUBA4B in NSCLC tissue, cell lines and is a poor predictor for prognosis and can regulate cell proliferation in NSCLC.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To induce the differentiation of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into neural-like cells in vitro and investigate the effect of micro-environment for induction on the differentiation as well as spontaneous dedifferentiation of differentiated MSCs. Methods: Rat MSCs were isolated and cultured in vitro, and determined for surface markers by flow cytometry, then induced with modified neuronal induction medium (MNM) and determined for the surface markers of neurocytes by IFA. The effects of micro-environment for induction, such as FBS concentration, MNM dosage, fresh and used MNM, on the neuronal differentiation of MSCs were observed. Results: Nissl bodies as well as neural specific surface markers including neuron-specific enolase (NSE), nestin and microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) were observed in the MSCs 6 h after induction with MNM. The neuronal differentiation rate of MSCs and the expressions of neural specific surface markers changed with the change of micro-environment for induction, and the neural-like cells could be dedifferentiated spontaneously back into MSC-like cells. Conclusions: MSCs could be differentiated into neural-like cells under induction of MNM, however, the change of micro-environment for induction influenced the differentiation of MSCs in both quality and quantity.",

        "abstract": "Iodine is an essential component for thyroid hormone synthesis. Epidemiological investigations have demonstrated that maternal mild iodine deficiency (ID)-induced hypothyroxinemia can affect intellectual and behavioral function in offspring. There is no definitive evidence demonstrating the effects of maternal iodine supplementation on neurobehavioral function in regional areas with mild ID. Thus, we aimed to clarify the effects of maternal mild ID and iodine supplementation on motor coordination in offspring and illuminate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Animal models of maternal mild ID and iodine supplementation were generated by providing Wistar rats an iodine-deficient diet and deionized water supplemented with potassium iodide during pregnancy and lactation. We found that mild ID-induced hypothyroxinemia led to a shorter latent time before falling down from the rotarod, a longer time to traverse the balance beam and poorer wire grip of the forelimbs, which imply motor coordination dysfunction. However, these impairments in the offspring were improved by iodine supplementation during pregnancy and lactation. We further observed that the ultrastructure and dendritic tree morphology of cerebellar Purkinje cells were altered in mild ID-induced hypothyroxinemia but that these changes could be reversed by iodine supplementation. Maternal mild ID and iodine supplementation also affected expression of the mGluR1 signaling pathway in offspring. Together, iodine supplementation during pregnancy and lactation can improve motor coordination in offspring by modulating the mGluR1 signaling pathway in mild ID-induced hypothyroxinemia rats.",

        "abstract": "CD4(+) T cells play an important role in regulating silica-induced inflammation and fibrosis. Recent studies showed that Wnt/β-catenin pathway could modulate the function and the differentiation of CD4(+) T cells. Therefore, Wnt/β-catenin pathway may participate in the development and progress of silicosis. To investigate the role of Wnt/β-catenin pathway, we used lentivirus expressing β-catenin shRNA to block the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by intratracheal instillation to the mice model of silicosis. Treatment of lentivirus could significantly aggravate the silica-induced lung inflammation and attenuated the fibrosis at the late stage. By analyzing CD4(+) T cells, we found that blockade of Wnt/β-catenin pathway suppressed regulatory T cells (Tregs). Reciprocally, enhanced Th17 response was responsible for the further accumulation of neutrophils and production of proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, blockade of Wnt/β-catenin pathway delayed the Th1/Th2 polarization by inhibiting Tregs and Th2 response. These results indicated that Wnt/β-catenin pathway could regulate Tregs to modulate Th immune response, which finally altered the pathological character of silicosis. Our study suggested that Wnt/β-catenin pathway might be a potential target to treat the silica-induced inflammation and fibrosis.",

The basic issue under investigation addresses the question: What is the largest range of time delay so that there exists a single PID controller to stabilize the delay plants within the entire range? Delay margin is a fundamental measure of robust stabilization against uncertain time delays and poses a fundamental, longstanding problem that remains open except in simple, isolated cases. In this paper we develop explicit expressions of the exact delay margin and its upper bounds achievable by a PID controller for low-order delay systems, notably the first- and second-order unstable systems with unknown delay. The effect of nonminimum phase zeros is also examined. Our results herein should provide useful guidelines in tuning PID controllers and in particular, the fundamental limits of delay within which a PID controller may robustly stabilize the delay processes.",

They first adopt a generalized notion of which is useful for problems where uncertainties are assumed to be bounded in an l p-induced matrix norm. Two different types of bounds, in terms of Perron root and interaction parameters, respectively, are given for the new SSV, and their relations are discussed. These bounds are useful in that they are easy to compute and may be further analyzed to provide insights useful in design",

        "abstract": "The aims are to assess respiration-related quality of life using the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire and determine its influencing factors among patients with silicosis in China.The incidence of silicosis had an increasing trend in recent years in developing countries. Although the majority of patients with silicosis are in therapy routinely, the patients' quality of life has been impaired because silicosis cannot be cured. The study on quality of life of patients with silicosis is few, and clinical physicians have difficulty in planning to promote quality of life of patients with silicosis according to the current health situation.A cross-sectional design was used for this study.A survey was performed on patients with silicosis by face-to-face interview in the Shenyang No. 9 Hospital in China. The St. George Respiratory Questionnaire was used to assess respiration-related quality of life.In all 208 enrolled patients with silicosis, symptoms, activity and impacts scores were 56·02, 56·46 and 52·33, respectively. Lower impacts scores were found comparing with symptoms and activity ones. Patient age was associated with an expected decrease in respiration-related quality of life. Patients with longer duration of exposure had higher total scores of the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire, indicating worse quality of life. Patients with more co-morbidities reported worse quality of life.Patients with silicosis were found relatively moderate respiration-related quality of life. Shortening dust exposure, decreasing the number of co-morbidity and controlling the occurrence of pulmonary tuberculosis could improve respiration-related quality of life.As indicated by the results of this study, the number of co-morbidity negatively impact the quality of life of patients with silicosis. Clinical physicians and nurses should pay close attention to the co-morbidity to promote quality of life of patients with silicosis according to the current health situation.",

        "abstract": "Nasal-type extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma (ENKL) is a highly invasive cancer with a poor prognosis. More effective and safer treatment regimens for ENKL are needed. Pegaspargase (PEG-Asp) has a similar mechanism of action to L-asparaginase (L-Asp), but presents lower antigenicity. The aim of the present research was to evaluate the safety profile and the latent efficacy of a PEG-Asp-based treatment regimen in patients with ENKL. Data collected from 20 patients with histologically confirmed ENKL, admitted to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University from January 2009 to August 2013, were included in the study. All patients received 2500 IU/m2/IM PEG-Asp on day 1 of every 21-day treatment cycle. Patients received combination chemotherapy with CHOP (n=5), EPOCH (n=7), GEMOX (n=7) or CHOP with bleomycin (n=1). After 2-5 treatment cycles (median, 4 cycles) of PEG-Asp-based chemotherapy, five patients (25%) showed a complete response (CR), and the overall response rate (ORR) was 60%. Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in fourteen patients (70%). Grade 3 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation was observed in two. Grade 1-2 non-hematological toxicity consisted of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) elongation (n=9), hypofibrinogenemia (n=6), hypoproteinemia (n=17), hyperglycemia (n=3), and nausea (n=6). No allergic reactions were detected. No treatment related death was reported. Our results suggested that PEG-Asp-based chemotherapy presented an acceptable tolerance and a potential short-term outcome in patients with nasal-type ENKL.",

To evaluate the effects of oligotrophic medium on the isolation of soil actinomycetes and develop a new isolation method, the Gause's synthetic medium was diluted to one tenth the recommended concentration in the present study. Soil dilution plate technique was used to isolate actinomycetes from the soil samples. Oligotrophy decreased actinomycete and streptomycete counts, as well as the number of antagonistic actinomycete species. Oligotrophy also decreased the number of actinomycete species in five samples. Some actinomycete species were cultured only on the oligotrophic medium, whereas other species could not be cultured. Oligotrophy decreased actinomycete counts more significantly for soils with organic matter content >40 g/kg. We used 16S rRNA sequence analysis to identify 22 actinomycete species that were only cultured on the oligotrophic medium. Oligotrophic medium was helpful for the isolation of Streptomyces spp., Micromonospora spp. and Streptosporangium spp. Slightly more than 80 % of the identified actinomycete species were biologically active. Therefore, we could draw a conclusion that oligotrophic medium could be helpful for the discovery of new antibiotic producers and the exploitation and utilization of new, biologically active compounds.",

Here, we show that hippocampal neurogranin, calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), calmodulin (CaM) and calcineurin (CaN) are implicated in the brain impairment in lactational rat hippocampus following developmental ID and hypothyroidism. Three developmental rat models were created by administrating dam rats with either iodine-deficient diet or propylthiouracil (PTU, 5 ppm or 15 ppm)-added drinking water from gestational day (GD) 6 till postnatal day (PN) 21. Then, the neurogranin, CaMKII, CaM and CaN in the hippocampus were detected with immunohistochemistry and western blotting on PN14 and PN21. The iodine-deficient and hypothyroid pups showed significantly lower level of neurogranin, CaMKII and CaM and significantly increased CaN in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions than the controls on PN14 and PN21 (P<0.05, respectively). Data indicate that, in lactational rats, hippocampal neurogranin, CaMKII, CaM and CaN are involved in the brain impairment by developmental ID and hypothyroidism.",

        "abstract": "Full blockade of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is believed to decrease morbidity and mortality of patients with chronic kidney disease. In non-dialysis patients, combined RAAS blockade with two different RAAS blockers causes more adverse events without improving survival, but its role in maintenance dialysis patients is still unclear. We conducted a systematic review and mediation analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of combined RAAS blockade in dialysis patients.Comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library database to June 2017 to identify relevant studies. Studies comparing combined with single RAAS blockade and reporting all-cause death, cardiovascular death, hypotension or hyperkalemia in dialysis patients were included. Effect sizes were calculated with randomized effects model and summarized as odd ratios (OR).A total of 9 studies with 13,050 dialysis patients were included. Compared with single blockade, combined blockade significantly reduced all-cause mortality (OR 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.54-0.93, p = 0.01), while cardiovascular mortality remained unchanged (0.85, 0.45-1.59, p = 0.61). Combined blockade tended to increase odd of hypotension but not odd of hyperkalemia (1.54, 1.00-2.38, p = 0.05; 0.89, 0.76-1.05, p = 0.17). Further mediation analysis indicated that hypotension might exert a suppression effect on the survival benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor plus angiotensin receptor blocker treatment on cardiovascular mortality.Combined RAAS blockade might be a promising treatment in dialysis patients to further reduce mortality if blood pressure was well controlled.",

        "abstract": "Silicosis is an occupational lung disease caused by the inhalation of silica dust and characterized by lung inflammation and fibrosis. Interleukin (IL)-1β is induced by silica and functions as the key pro-inflammatory cytokine in this process. The Th17 response, which is induced by IL-1β, has been reported very important in chronic human lung inflammatory diseases. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of IL-1β and IL-17 in silicosis, we used anakinra and an anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody (mAb) to block the receptor of IL-1β (IL-RI) and IL-17, respectively, in a mouse model of silicosis. We observed increased IL-1β expression and an enhanced Th17 response after silica instillation. Treatment with an IL-1 type I receptor (IL-1RI) antagonist anakinra substantially decreased silica-induced lung inflammation and the Th17 response. Lung inflammation and the accumulation of inflammatory cells were attenuated in the IL-17-neutralized silicosis group. IL-17 may promote lung inflammation by modulating the differentiation of Th1 and regulatory T cells (Tregs) and by regulating the production of IL-22 and IL-1β during the lung inflammation of silicosis. Silica may induce IL-1β production from alveolar macrophages and promote inflammation by initiating a Th17 response via an IL-1β/IL-1RI-dependent mechanism. The Th17 response could induce lung inflammation during the pathogenesis of silicosis by regulating the homoeostasis of the Th immune responses and affecting the production of IL-22 and IL-1β. This study describes a potentially important inflammatory mechanism of silicosis that may bring about novel therapies for this inflammatory and fibrotic disease.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: To explore fish sauce and nitrosated fish sauce on HGPRT mutation of Chinese hamster ovary cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the HGPRT gene mutation assay with soft agar method, we set up four dosage groups of fish sauce and nitrosated fish sauce: 5 μl/ml,2.5 μl/ml,1.25 μl/ml,0.625 μl/ml, and the positive control groups of EMS: 0.75 μg/ml, MCA: 4 μg/ml and the negative control group (distilled water).Then we calculated mutant frequency of all treatment groups to assess the mutagenesis of fish sauce and nitrosated fish sauce on CHO cells. RESULTS: The mutant frequency of all treatment groups were significantly different(χ2S9-=41.115;FS9+=19.528;P<0.01). The frequency in nitrosated fish sauce groups and fish sauce groups by S9 metabolic activation was significantly higher than those in control groups (P<0.05 or P<0.01), with a dose-response relationship(S9-: r nitrosated fish sauce=0.986, P<0.05; S9+: r fish sauce=0.950, P=0.05, r nitrosated fish sauce=0.997, P<0.01); But the difference of mutant frequency between fish sauce without S9 and control group was not significant(P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Fish sauce nitrosation of mobile vendors in the area could cause HGPRT locus mutation of CHO cells, and S9 metabolic of fish sauce might also cause this effect.",

        "abstract": "The present study aimed to unveil the biological role of carbonic anhydrase IV (CA IV) and its association with clinical pathological characteristics and prognostic significance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The relative expression level of CA IV was measured by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 114 resected NSCLC tumors and matched adjacent normal tissues and NSCLC cell lines. Overexpression and cell proliferation were assessed in human NSCLC cell lines transfected with CA IV mRNA by lentivirus-mediated technology. The association of CA IV expression with clinical pathological features and overall survival in 114 cases of NSCLC patients was analyzed. It was demonstrated that CA IV expression was significantly downregulated in NSCLC tumors and six cell lines. Reduced expression of CA IV was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis. The overall survival of NSCLC patients with low CA IV expression was significantly shorter compared with the high expression group. Overexpression of CA IV suppressed cell proliferation in A549 and NCI-H1299 cells. The results indicate that low expression of CA IV promotes cell proliferation and serves as an indicator for poor prognosis in NSCLC.",

        "abstract": "Mature microRNA (miRNA) 34a-5p, which is a well-known tumor suppressor in hepatitis virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), plays an important role in cell processes, such as cell proliferation and apoptosis, and is therefore an optimal biomarker for future clinical use. However, the role of miRNA-34a-5p in chemoresistance has yet to be identified. In the present study, the expression of miRNA-34a-5p was assessed by an  hybridization assay in HCC tissues and was found to be significantly decreased compared with the pericarcinomatous areas of the tissue specimens, which consisted of samples obtained from 114 patients with HCC. High expression of miRNA-34a-5p was found to be associated with a favorable overall survival time in HCC patients. Functional tests performed by transfecting miRNA-34a-5p mimics or inhibitors into MHCC-97L cells illustrated that miRNA-34a-5p inhibited proliferation, elevated apoptosis and decreased chemoresistance to cisplatin in HCC cells. AXL is the direct target of miRNA-34a-5p, as confirmed by sequence analysis and luciferase assay. Transfection of the cells with small interfering RNA for AXL (siAXL) increased the apoptosis ratio of the MHCC-97L cell line. Transfection with siAXL led to similar biological behaviors in the MHCC-97L cells to those induced by ectopic expression of miRNA-34a-5p. Thus, it was concluded that miRNA-34a-5p enhanced the sensitivity of the cells to chemotherapy by targeting AXL in hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, low expression of miRNA-34a-5p in HCC tissues yielded an unfavorable prognosis for patients with HCC that received radical surgery, due to the promotion of proliferation and an increase in chemoresistance in HCC cells.",

        "abstract": "To explore the microecological mechanism of healthy plant growth in continuous potato fields in Gansu Province,China,we measured contents of available soil nitrogen(NH4+-N),phosphorus(P),and potassium(K)using conventional soil nutrient analytic methods,abundance of soil actinomycetes using serial dilution and plating techniques,and screened antagonistic actinomycetes from obtained actinomycete isolates using the agar block method.The selected dominant actinomycetes were identified by 16S rRNA sequence analysis,and the inhibitory effect of one dominant actinomycete,Streptomyces gancidicus,was tested using culture filtrate.Results showed that in the four-year continuous potato field,available soil P and K contents in the rhizosphere of diseased plants were respectively 29.9% and 12.5% lower than those of healthy plants,whereas soil NH4+-N content in the rhizosphere of diseased plant was 24.1% higher than that of healthy plant.Compared with those from the rhizosphere of healthy plants,the number of soil actinomycetes,Micromonospora,and unidentified actinomycetes from the rhizosphere of diseased plants cultured with the Gause1 medium decreased by 51.1%,83.0%,and 53.9%,respectively,whereas the number of soil actinomycetes and Streptomyces from the rhizosphere of diseased plants cultured with the Humic Acid medium decreased by46.0% and 46.7%,respectively.The soil actinomycetes antagonistic potentiality(SAAP)of actinomycetes with antagonistic effects on the four pathogenic fungi of potato were lower in the rhizosphere of diseased plants than in the rhizosphere of healthy plants.S.gancidicus and S.galilaeus were found dominant in the rhizosphere of healthy and diseased plants,respectively.In conclusion,the microecology of rhizosphere soil that supports healthy plant growth in the continuous potato field is mainly characterized by:available nutrient combination of abundant P and K with relatively poor N contents;and a larger number of soil actinomycetes than those of diseased plants,with the numerically dominant actinomycetes showing beneficial antagonistic effect on several common soil-borne pathogenic fungi.",

This problem is in the framework of H∞ identification, but the formulation here is more general. The available a priori information in our problem consists of a lower bound on the relative stability of the plant, an upper bound on a certain gain associated with the plant, and an upper bound on the noise level. The plant to be identified is assumed to lie in a certain subset in the space of H∞, characterized by the assumed a priori information. The available experimental information consists of a corrupt finite output time series obtained in response to a known nonzero but otherwise arbitrary input. The proposed algorithm is in the class of interpolatory algorithms which are known to possess desirable optimality properties in reducing the identification error. This algorithm is obtained by solving an extended Caratheodory-Fejer problem via standard convex programming methods. Both the algorithm and error bounds ran be applied to l1 identification problems as well",

A distinctive feature of this approach is that it requires no knowledge of delay variation rate and hence is more broadly applicable when this information is unavailable. While because of this generality the stability conditions may suffer from their conservatism, we show that there are important instances where the conditions are in fact nonconservative, and may fare better than those developed elsewhere for fast varying delays.",

        "abstract": "Early detection of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions can improve long-term patient survival. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic performance of gadoxetic acid disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI) and multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) was performed in diagnosing small HCCs measuring up to 2 cm(≤2cm). Two investigators searched multiple databases for studies in which the performances of either Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI or MDCT were reported with sufficient data to construct 2 × 2 contingency tables for diagnosing HCCs up to 2 cm on a per-lesion or per-patient level. Diagnostic performances were quantitatively pooled by a bivariate random-effect model with further meta-regression and subgroup analyses. Twenty-seven studies (fourteen on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI, nine on MDCT and four on both) were included, enrolling a total of 1735 patients on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI and 1781 patients on MDCT. Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI demonstrated significantly higher overall sensitivity than did MDCT (0.96 vs 0.65, p＜0.01), without substantial loss of specificity (0.98 vs 0.94, pu003e0.05). Area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.9712 with Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI and 0.8538 with MDCT. Regarding Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI, sensitivity was significantly higher for studies from non-Asian countries than Asian countries(0.96 vs 0.93, p＜0.01), for retrospective studies than prospective studies(0.95 vs 0.91, p＜0.01), and for those with Gd-EOB-DTPA injection rate≥1.5ml/s than that of＜1.5ml/s (0.97 vs 0.90, p＜0.01). Conclusions: Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI demonstrated higher sensitivity and overall diagnostic accuracy than MDCT, and thus should be the preferred imaging modality for diagnosing small HCCs measuring up to 2 cm.

The permittivity of grain in the barn can be obtained by velocity and attenuation tomography inversion method. Then the density of the grain can be calculated based on the relationship between permittivity and grain density. At the same time, the actual height of grain and the shape of unconventionality objects in the barn can be imaged by velocity and attenuation tomography image method. Actual bulk of the grain can be calculated with the information of actual height and the size of unconventional objects. Based on the density and bulk information of barn, the practical reserves can be achieved.

Nevertheless, genomic data has not yet been used for CRC prognostication.To identify recurrent somatic mutations with prognostic significance in patients with CRC.Exome sequencing was performed to identify somatic mutations in tumour tissues of 22 patients with CRC, followed by validation of 187 recurrent and pathway-related genes using targeted capture sequencing in additional 160 cases.Seven significantly mutated genes, including four reported (APC, TP53, KRAS and SMAD4) and three novel recurrently mutated genes (CDH10, FAT4 and DOCK2), exhibited high mutation prevalence (6-14% for novel cancer genes) and higher-than-expected number of non-silent mutations in our CRC cohort. For prognostication, a five-gene-signature (CDH10, COL6A3, SMAD4, TMEM132D, VCAN) was devised, in which mutation(s) in one or more of these genes was significantly associated with better overall survival independent of tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging. The median survival time was 80.4 months in the mutant group versus 42.4 months in the wild type group (p=0.0051). The prognostic significance of this signature was successfully verified using the data set from the Cancer Genome Atlas study.The application of next-generation sequencing has led to the identification of three novel significantly mutated genes in CRC and a mutation signature that predicts survival outcomes for stratifying patients with CRC independent of TNM staging.",

        "abstract": "One-dimensional electrophoresis (1-DE) of proteins, two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) of proteins and cloning of cDNA sequence were used to study the virulence differentiation of Curvularia lunata (Wakker) Boed. isolated from maize (Zea maydis L.) in China. From 1-DE gel profiles of proteins, 110 reproducible bands were separated from six isolates of C. lunata CX-3, SD-6, C-152, C107-1, DD-60 and W-18. Sixty-eight bands (61.82%) were polymorphic, suggesting huge biodiversities among the isolates. All isolates for the experiment were clustered into three groups consisting of different virulent types by coefficient value of 0.605. Group 1, consisting of CX-3, SD-6 and C-152 with high virulence displayed more protein bands than Groups 2 and 3, consisting of C107-1 and DD-60 with low virulence. Proteomics approaches based on 2-DE techniques were applied to identify specific proteins associated with the virulence differentiation in CX-3 and DD-60. A total of 423 protein spots were separated. Out of them 75 specific protein spots were displayed in 2-DE gels. Among them 28 protein spots were unique in CX-3 and eight in DD-60, and 39 protein spots were shown on both 2-DE gels but expressed differently in intensity. Twenty protein spots including three unique protein spots and 17 differentially expressed protein spots (more than two-fold DD-60) in CX-3 were further identified with MALDI-TOF MS/MS. Results indicated that most of the identified proteins were found to be associated with virulence differentiation, metabolisms, stress response and signal transduction. One of them was identified as Brn1 protein, which had been reported to be related to melanin biosynthesis and the virulence differentiation in fungi. Combined with our previous findings, we assumed that Brn1 protein and its regulating products might be involved in the virulence differentiation of C. lunata. Consequently, we cloned a Brn1 cDNA fragment and aligned it with the fragments in other fungi. Results indicated that the 633-bp sequence of Brn1 cloned in C. lunata was highly homological with the compared fungi. Further work for the exact gene roles of Brn1 in our case is underway. © 2007 Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.",

The brains of 5 pups from each group were fixed by intracardiac perfusion at 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42 days after birth. Brain sections were observed and analyzed by immunohistochemistry on the expression of ERK1/2 in the CA1, CA3 and DG regions of hippocampus.The expressions of ERKl/2 in CA1 and CA3 regions of hippocampus in iodine-deficient group, PTU 5 mg/L group and PTU 15 mg/L group were significantly lower than those in control group (P < 0.05) at 14, 21, 28 and 42 days after birth. The expression of ERK1/2 in DG region was not significantly different in all four groups. The expressions of ERK1/2 were not significantly different in all four groups at 7 days after birth.Iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism may decrease the expression of ERK1/2 in the hippocampus of pups.",

        "abstract": "3'3-Diindolylmethane (DIM) has been proved to exhibit anticancer properties in many solid tumors. In our previous study, we demonstrated that DIM inhibited SGC7901 cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis and delaying cell cycle progression. Herein, we further explored the anti-tumor effect of DIM on SGC-7901 tumor bearing mice. Tumors were excised, weighed, and tested by western blot and TdT-UTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis. The expression levels of AhR and cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP1A1) protein were evaluated by western-blot assay. Our data show that with the increase of DIM dose (0, 5, 10, 20 mg/kg/day), AhR protein gradually decreased as CYP1A1 protein increased. The weight of the tumors found in the treated animals was significantly lower than that of the control group (0.845±0.096 vs. 1.275±0.236 g, 0.768±0.161 vs. 1.275±0.236 g, 0.607±0.106 vs. 1.275±0.236 g, P<0.05). TUNEL test showed that DIM induced increased apoptosis in the treatment groups in a dose-dependent manner. Blood tests also indicated that DIM showed no toxic effect on animal weight or liver and kidney function. These results indicated that DIM agent could be a safe and potent drug in therapy of gastric cancer.",

        "abstract": "A recent study indicated that Lectin-type oxidized LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) was a distinct surface marker for human polymorphonuclears myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSC). The present study was aimed to investigate the existence LOX-1 PMN-MDSC in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.127 HCC patients, 10 patients with mild active chronic hepatits B, 10 liver cirrhosis due to hepatitis B, 10 liver dysplastic node with hepatitis B and 50 health control were included.LOX-1+ CD15+ PMN-MDSC were significantly elevated in HCC patients compared with healthy control and patients with benign diseases. LOX-1+ CD15+ PMN-MDSC in circulation were positively associated with those in HCC tissues. LOX-1+ CD15+ PMN-MDSCs significantly reduced proliferation and IFN-γ production of T cells with a dosage dependent manner with LOX-1- CD15+ PMNs reached negative results. The suppression on T cell proliferation and IFN-γ production was reversed by ROS inhibitor and Arginase inhibitor. ROS level and activity of arginase of LOX-1+ CD15+ PMN were higher in LOX-1+ CD15+ PMN-MDSCs than LOX-1- CD15+ PMNs, as well as the expression of the NADPH oxidase NOX2 and arginase I. RNA sequence revealed that LOX-1+ CD15+ PMN-MDSCs displayed significantly higher expression of spliced X-box-binding protein 1 (sXBP1), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress marker. ER stress inducer induced LOX-1 expression and suppressive function for CD15+ PMN from health donor. For HCC patients, LOX-1+ CD15+ PMN-MDSCs were positively related to overall survival.LOX-1+ CD15+ PMN-MDSC were elevated in HCC patients and suppressed T cell proliferation through ROS/Arg I pathway induced by ER stress. They presented positive association with the prognosis of HCC patients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "High ankle-brachial index (ABI) is marker of increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, while the relationship and mechanism between high ABI and metabolic syndrome (MetS) are unclear. The objectives of this study were to determine the relationship and possible mechanism of MetS with high ABI.341 participants without CRF were recruited. Among these participants, 58 participants (ABI ≥ 1.3) were include in high ABI group and the other 283 participants (0.9 < ABI < 1.3) were include in normal ABI group. Furthermore, these 341 participants were also divided into MetS group (n = 54) and non-MetS group (n = 287). All participants received examinations including body mass index (BMI), ABI and related biochemical parameters.Compared with non-MetS group, the prevalence of high ABI was higher in MetS group (27.8% vs. 15%, p < 0.05). Participants with 3-4 metabolic risk factors had higher prevalence of high ABI than those with 0-1 metabolic risk factors (27.8% vs. 12.7%, p < 0.05). The prevalence of high ABI in overweight participants was higher than those with normal body weight. And the participants with hypertension also had higher prevalence of high ABI than normotensive participants. BMI, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were all higher in high ABI group than normal ABI group (p < 0.05).More metabolic risk factors have increased the risk of high ABI. Inflammation and oxidative stress are associated with prevalence of high ABI in metabolic syndrome patients without chronic renal failure.",

        "abstract": "Prefetching is a common technique of tolerating the memory latency. However, it rapidly increases the communications traffic between the upper-level storage and the lower-level. Based on the analysis of access patterns of the SPEC benchmarks, we propose a novel push structure, in which the L2 cache can actively push instructions and data to the L1 cache at a proper time without the request from the L1 cache. By using a cycle-accurate simulator running SPEC benchmarks, the experimenting results showed that our push structure can significantly reduce the access to the L2 cache by 34.6%. Therefore, our push structure can effectively reduce the communications traffic between the L1 and the L2 cache. Our push structure also averagely increases the IPC by 6.6%.",

We assume that the agents' input is subject to a constant albeit possibly unknown time delay, and is generated by a distributed dynamic output feedback control protocol. Drawing upon concepts and techniques from robust control, notably those concerning gain margin optimization and analytic interpolation, we derive explicit, closed-form conditions for general linear agents to achieve consensus. Our results display an explicit dependence of the consensus condition on the delay value as well as on the agent's unstable poles and non-minimum phase zeros, showing that delayed communication between agents will generally hinder consensus and impose restrictions on the network topology. We also show that a lower bound on the maximal delay allowable for consensus can be computed by a simple line search method.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the feasibility, oncological safety, and aesthetic result of skin-spring mastectomy (SSM) or nipple-spring mastectomy (NSM) in breast reconstruction of implant (permanent gel or expander) for breast cancer patients who were not fit for the breast conserving surgery (BCS).Between October 2005 and July 2011, 89 women with breast caner underwent SSM or NSM, with an average age of 42.4 years (range, 19-55 years) and an average disease duration of 5.7 months (range, 1-24 months). The pathological examination revealed invasive ductal carcinoma in 55 cases, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in 15 cases, invasive ductal carcinoma + DCIS in 8 cases, DCIS with infiltration in 10 cases, and occult breast cancer in 1 case. According to tumor staging criterion of American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), 15 cases were rated as stage 0, 51 cases as stage I, 22 cases as stage II, and 1 case as unclear. Finally, 33 patients underwent SSM and 56 patients underwent NSM according to the location and diameter of tumor and the infiltration of tumor to nipple. Secondary breast reconstruction was performed with permanent gel replacement after axillary lymph node dissection in 9 patients with positive sentinel lymph node and 1 patient with occult breast cancer; immediate breast reconstruction was performed with permanent gel in the other patients. All the patients received the chemotherapy or/and radiotherapy according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline.Complications occurred in 5 patients undergoing breast reconstruction of permanent gel after NSM, including 1 case of haemorrhage, 2 cases of infection, and 2 cases of local skin necrosis. Primary healing of incision was obtained in the others. No nipple necrosis was observed in patients undergoing NSM. All the patients were followed up 14-88 months (median, 40 months). At 10 months after operation, the aesthetic results were excellent in 40 cases, good in 33 cases, fair in 14 cases, and poor in 2 cases, with an excellent and good rate of 82%. No recurrence or metastasis was found during follow-up.The SSM or NSM is feasible and oncological safe for patients who are not fit for BCS, with satisfactory aesthetic result.",

        "abstract": "Objective To explore the relationship between immune dysfunction and disturbance of lymphocytic apoptosis signal transduction pathway in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods Flow cytometry was used to determine the expression rates of membrane Fas, FasL, and activated intracellular caspase-3 in lymphocytes, and determine the percentage of apoptotic cells (AnnexinV positive, PI negative) and necrotic cells (AnnexinV positive, PI positive). The serum concentrations of anti-nucleosome antibodies were assayed by ELISA. Results Compared with health control group, the percentages of apoptotic cells and necrotic cells enhanced in patients with inactive or active SLE (P < 0.05), and the expression rates of Fas, FasL, and activated caspase-3 significantly increased in patients with inactive or active SLE (P < 0.05). Compared with inactive SLE group, the percentage of apoptotic cells and necrotic cells enhanced in patients with active SLE, but only the increase of necrotic cells was significant (P < 0.05). There was no obvious difference of expression rates of Fas, FasL, and activated caspase-3 of lymphocytes between the two disease groups (P > 0.05). The serum concentration of anti-nucleosome antibodies was strikingly higher in patients with active SLE than those in inactive SLE patients and health control group. The percentage of apoptotic cells and the expression rate of activated caspase-3 were negatively correlated with the concentration of complement 3 in SLE patients. Conclusion Fas-mediated signal pathway plays an important role in apoptosis imbalance of lymphocytes in patients with SLE. The activation of caspase-3 in lymphocytes is a crucial feature of lymphocytic apoptosis activation. The degree of apoptosis activation of lymphocytes is correlated with disease activity and immune response dysfunction. The degree of lymphocytic apoptosis imbalance is associated with the level of anti-nucleosome antibodies. Acceleration of lymphocytic apoptosis plays an important role in immune pathologic injury and immune regulation dysfunction.",

        "abstract": "A time-delay system may or may not be stable for different periods of delay. When will then a delay system be stable or unstable, and for what ranges of delay? This paper attempts to answer these questions. We show that by finding a set of critical delay values, for which the system's characteristic quasipolynomial has zeros on the imaginary axis, it is possible to determine its stability in the full range of the delay parameter by characterizing the analytical behaviors of the zeros. This characterization is facilitated by an operator perturbation approach, which is both conceptually attractive and computationally efficient. The entire procedure, which first identifies the critical zeros on the imaginary axis and next determines whether the zeros cross the imaginary axis, requires only solving a generalized eigenvalue problem.",

        "abstract": "Vitamin A (VA) has a number of important biological functions in human growth and development. Previous studies by our group demonstrated that the normal VA levels improved recovery of learning and memory function and decreased apoptosis in rats with hypoxic‑ischemic brain damage (HIBD). However, it has not been fully elucidated how VA regulates the apoptosis of neuronal cells. To investigate the anti‑apoptotic effect of VA, an in vitro oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) model in PC12 cells was treated with four concentrations of all‑trans‑retinoic acid (ATRA), an active in vivo product of VA. Following in vitro OGD injury in PC12 cells, the percentage of apoptosis and the fluorescence intensity of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were increased in the cells, and the expression levels of B-cell lymphoma-associated X (Bax) were enhanced. ATRA treatment at 2‑4 µmol/l for 24 h decreased the percentage of apoptosis and the MMP of the PC12 cells injured by OGD. ATRA at 4 µmol/l also reduced the expression levels of Bax and enhanced the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2. Furthermore, RNA interference with retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) reversed the observed effect in PC12 cells following ATRA treatment at 4 µmol/l alone. In conclusion, the present study suggested that treatment with ATRA at 4 µmol/l suppressed apoptosis of PC12 cells following OGD injury, potentially through regulation of the RARα signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "Hypothyroidism induced by severe iodine deficiency (ID) during developmental period seriously damages the central nervous system function. In addition to developmental hypothyroidism induced by severe ID, developmental hypothyroxinemia induced by mild ID is potentially damaging for neurodevelopment and learning and memory in children. Wistar rats were treated with iodine-deficient diet or methimazole (MMZ) during pregnancy and lactation to induce developmental hypothyroxinemia or hypothyroidism in the present study. Pups were weaned on postnatal day (PN) 21 and used for electrophysiological recordings on PN80. It is generally accepted that long-term depression (LTD) is induced at low-frequency stimulation (LFS) in hippocampal CA1 region. Surprisingly, we observed developmental hypothyroxinemia as well as developmental hypothyroidism led to high-frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced LTD in hippocampal CA1 region. The abnormal HFS-induced LTD suggests not only developmental hypothyroidism but also developmental hypothyroxinemia impairs learning and memory. To explore the mechanisms responsible for the HFS-induced LTD, the phosphorylation status of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) was investigated. The results showed that developmental hypothyroxinemia as well as developmental hypothyroidism decreased the phosphorylation of AMPAR subunit glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1) at serine 831 and serine 845 in hippocampal CA1 region. Neither developmental hypothyroxinemia nor developmental hypothyroidism altered the phosphorylation of AMPAR subunit glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2) at serine 880. Increased levels of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) were also observed in hippocampal CA1 regions of pups subjected to developmental hypothyroxinemia or hypothyroidism. Taken together, our results suggest that the increased levels of PP1 caused by developmental hypothyroxinemia or hypothyroidism may account for the dephosphorylation of GluR1 at serine 831 and serine 845, which may contribute to HFS-induced LTD in hippocampal CA1 region.",

The techniques used to fabricate such a coating tend to be costly, time and energy consuming; further surface modification steps are often needed. In this study, a superhydrophobic composite electrodeposit based on tungsten disulphide nanoparticles dispersed in nickel on a mild steel substrate was successfully developed. At room temperature, the deposit showed a water contact angle of 158.3 deg and a sliding angle of 7.7 deg. The effects of operational parameters on surface morphology and superhydrophobicity are discussed. Compared to the substrate, the robust surface of the as-prepared coatings exhibited good self-cleaning and corrosion resistance, providing potential for industrial applications.",

        "abstract": "Silica exposure can cause lung inflammation and fibrosis, known as silicosis. Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and Th17 cells play a pivotal role in controlling inflammatory diseases. However, the roles of IL-17A and Th17 cells in the progress of silica-induced inflammation and fibrosis are poorly understood. This study explored the effects of IL-17A on silica-induced inflammation and fibrosis. We used an anti-mouse IL-17A antibody to establish an IL-17A-neutralized mice model, and mice were exposed to silica to establish an experimental silicosis model. We showed that IL-17A neutralization delayed neutrophil accumulation and progression of silica-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis. IL-17A neutralization reduced the percentage of Th17 in CD4+ T cells, decreased IL-6 and IL-1β expression, and increased Tregs at an early phase of silica-induced inflammation. Neutralization of IL-17A delayed silica-induced Th1/Th2 immune and autoimmune responses. These results suggest that IL-17A neutralization alleviates early stage silica-induced lung inflammation and delays progression of silica-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis. Neutralization of IL-17A suppressed Th17 cell development by decreasing IL-6 and/or IL-1β and increased Tregs at an early phase of silica-induced inflammation. Neutralization of IL-17A also delayed the Th1/Th2 immune response during silica-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis. IL-17A may play a pivotal role in the early phase of silica-induced inflammation and may mediate the Th immune response to influence silica-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis in mice.",

In particular, we aim to minimize the  $mathcal{H}_{infty}$ -norm subject to allocation of the weights on the edges.

For distribution networks with one port, i.e., SISO systems, we show that the  $mathcal{H}_{infty}$ -norm coincides with the effective resistance between the nodes in the port. Moreover, we derive an upper bound of the  $mathcal{H}_{infty}$ -norm, which is in terms of the algebraic connectivity of the graph on which the distribution network is defined.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The biologically active form of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) plays a key role in the development of lung fibrosis. CD36 is involved in the transformation of latent TGF-β1 (L-TGF-β1) to active TGF-β1. To clarify the role of CD36 in the development of silica-induced lung fibrosis, a rat silicosis model was used to observe both the inhibition of L-TGF-β1 activation and the antifibrotic effect obtained by lentiviral vector silencing of CD36 expression. METHODS: The rat silicosis model was induced by intratracheal injection of 10 mg silica per rat and CD36 expression was silenced by administration of a lentiviral vector (Lv-shCD36). The inhibition of L-TGF-β1 activation was examined using a CCL-64 mink lung epithelial growth inhibition assay, while determination of hydroxyproline content along with pathological and immunohistochemical examinations were used for observation of the inhibition of silica-induced lung fibrosis. RESULTS: The lentiviral vector (Lv-shCD36) silenced expression of CD36 in alveolar macrophages (AMs) obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and the activation of L-TGF-β1 in the BALF was inhibited by Lv-shCD36. The hydroxyproline content of silica+Lv-shCD36 treated groups was significantly lower than in other experimental groups. The degree of fibrosis in the silica+Lv-shCD36-treated groups was less than observed in other experimental groups. The expression of collagen I and III in the silica+Lv-shCD36-treated group was significantly lower than in the other experimental groups. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that silencing expression of CD36 can result in the inhibition of L-TGF-β1 activation in a rat silicosis model, thus further preventing the development of silica-induced lung fibrosis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) are broadly used for many diseases, but the efficacy of MSC engraftment is very low due to low viability and high cell death rate under a stressful microenvironment. The present study aimed to investigate whether microRNA-34a (miR-34a), which is a downstream target of P53, is involved in H2O2-induced MSC cell death. MATERIAL AND METHODS Human bone marrow MSCs (hMSCs) were purchased from Lonza and were cultured as previously described. hMSCs were transfected with miR-34a inhibitor and exposed to H2O2. Cell proliferation assay was used to assess the survival rate of hMSCs. Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis were used to examine proliferation and survival ability of hMSCs. RESULTS H2O2 exposure significantly increased miR-34a expression in human bone marrow MSCs. H2O2 challenge induced massive MSC cell death along with reduction of expression of proliferation marker Ki67 and survival-related genes Bcl-2 and Survivin. Transfection of miR-34a inhibitor anti-34a led to a significant protective effect and rescued MSC cell death triggered by H2O2 exposure by 50%. Moreover, anti-34a dramatically increased Bcl-2 and Ki67 mRNA expression levels by over 10-fold compared to the mock control group under H2O2 exposure. The protein levels of Bcl-2 and Survivin were also rescued by anti-34a treatment by 50%. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that miR-34a plays a key role in oxidative stress-induced MSC cell death, and targeting miR-34a might be a promising strategy to enhance the survival rate of engrafted stem cells, which may improve therapeutic outcome.",

Our results showed that the germinating conidia were the ideal starting material for transformation. Based on our optimised transformation condition, the transformation efficiency of C. lunata with T-DNA was improved greatly, and the average transformation frequency was as high as 84 ± 5 transformants per 1 × 106 germlings. Southern blotting results of 39 randomly-selected transformants showed a unique hybridisation pattern and predominant single-copy insertions. An ATMT library containing approximate 3000 transformants was generated, and four types of transformants were screened in terms of growth rate, sporulation, mycelial pigmentation, and toxin production in vitro. This library will be used to identify genes involved in the virulence of the pathogen. © 2009 KNPV.",

The comparison between the tobacco leaf area and background area for RGB attributes in these two types of images were conducted by sampling with a moving 3 × 3 matrix of pixels. It was found that most of the blue vector value of pixels in transmission image of tobacco leaf were equal to zero and few of them with greater than zero were distributed discontinuously within the matrix. It was also found that the relative standard deviation (RSD) of blue vector value in a matrix with nine pixels located on the tobacco leaf area in the transmission image was either 0 or more than 100%. Based on the findings, an approach to image segmentation with area-oriented statistics was thus proposed in this paper. The results show that the segmentation accuracy is higher than that by the method of point-oriented statistics, and the average pixels of all segmented image in this study were 0.65% more than those by point statistics per tobacco leaf. The characteristics of the original object image were well kept after segmentation. The presented method may be helpful to increase segmentation accuracy and lay foundations for further studies by using transmission characteristics of tobacco leaf.",

        "abstract": "The chit42 gene was cloned from Metarhizium anisopliae CY1 and was inserted into Trichoderma koningii T30 genome by protoplast transformation. Sixteen transgenic isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction analysis. The chit42 gene was 1275 bp in length and its coded protein was approximately 42 kDa in size. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis and the measurement of the chitinase activity under induced conditions were conducted. Mortality of the Asian corn borer (Ostrinia furnacalis) was used for assessing efficacy of culture filtrates and conidial suspensions of transgenic Trichoderma strains against the insect. The results indicated that the transgenic Trichoderma strain harboring chit42 gene from Metarhizium anisopliae CY1 showed significant lethal effect on the Asian corn borer larvae. Study on growth inhibition of silkworm (Bombyx mori) larvae was carried out. The transgenic Trichoderma could better hinder the growth and development of the silkworm larvae than the wild-type Trichoderma did. The inhibition to the expression of three genes associated with development and anti-stress response in the mid-gut of the Asian corn borer larvae was more significant in the transcriptional level after larvae were fed with transgenic biomass than with the wild type. Evaluation of inhibition on the growth of maize ear rot pathogens was carried out in vitro test and the transgenic strains kept antagonistic activity against Fusarium verticilloides.",

        "abstract": "Aims: To assess the nutritional status, combination with anthropometric measurements and modified quantitative subjective global assessment (MQSGA) was used in multi-center hemodialysis population in South China. Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive-analytic study was performed in 4 teaching hospitals in South China, dated from January 2010 to December 2011. Nutritional status was assessed with MQSGA and related anthropometric indexes. Serum albumin and transthyretin were also determined for nutritional assessment. Results: Eighty-two randomly selected hemodialysis patients participated in the nutritional assessment, of which 75 hemodialysis patients completed all assessments. The average age was 62.70 ± 14.21 years. The mean duration of hemodialysis was 3.29 ± 1.08 years. Of the included patients, 32% patients were well nourished, 60% were mild to moderately malnourished, and 8% were severely malnourished. Along with the malnutrition severity, the serum transthyretin significantly decreased. However, no obvious changes were found in serum albumin. The mean value (Mean ± SD; 25.78 ± 4.09 cm) of mid arm circumference (MAC) was negatively correlated with MQSGA (r = -0.365; P = 0.002). Body mass index (BMI) (Mean ± SD; 21.6 ± 3.1 kg/m2) was also significantly negatively correlated with MQSGA (r = -0.392; P = 0.001). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.664 and 0.726, respectively. Conclusions: Malnutrition is very common in South China hemodialysis population. Both BMI and MAC were effective markers for assessing nutritional status. © Ivyspring International Publisher.",

        "abstract": "The antineoplastic antibiotic, bleomycin, is known to induce a well-recognized model of lung fibrosis. Active transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) plays a key role in lung fibrosis induced by bleomycin, TSP-1 (thrombospondin-1) being critical to the activation of L (latent)-TGF-β1 by virtue of an association of the TSP-1/L-TGF-β1 complex with CD36, involving the sequence CSVTCG of the TSP-1 functional fragment. To observe the inhibitory effects of TSP-1 functional fragments, critical for CD36 binding, on the activation of L-TGF-β1, we isolated alveolar macrophages from Wistar rat lungs 7 days after bleomycin administration (5 mg/kg body weight) and cultured the cells with or without TSP-1 functional or control fragments. We observed a cell surface association of TGF-β1 with CD36 by immunofluorescence and quantified the active and total TGF-β1 by ELISA. The co-localization of CD36 with TGF-β1, shown by a yellow fluorescence deriving from a mixture of the green and red of the two components, for the TSP-1 functional fragment groups was clearly less than that of the TSP-1 control fragment groups. The quantities and the percentages of active TGF-β1 in the TSP-1 functional fragment groups were lower than those in the TSP-1 control fragment groups (P<0.05 or P<0.01). These findings suggest that TSP-1 functional fragments could inhibit the activation of L-TGF-β1 secreted by activated alveolar macrophages through blocking the binding of TSP-1 to CD36. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

        "abstract": "Streptomyces lydicus A01 and Trichoderma harzianum P1 are potential biocontrol agents of fungal diseases in plants. S. lydicus A01 produces natamycin to bind the ergosterol of the fungal cell membrane and inhibits the growth of Botrytis cinerea. T. harzianum P1, on the other hand, features high chitinase activity and decomposes the chitin in the cell wall of B. cinerea. To obtain the synergistic biocontrol effects of chitinase and natamycin on Botrytis cinerea, this study transformed the chit42 gene from T. harzianum P1 to S. lydicus A01. The conjugal transformant (CT) of S. lydicus A01 with the chit42 gene was detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Associated chitinase activity and natamycin production were examined using the 3, 5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method and ultraviolet spectrophotometry, respectively. The S. lydicus A01-chit42 CT showed substantially higher chitinase activity and natamycin production than its wild type strain (WT). Consequently, the biocontrol effects of S. lydicus A01-chit42 CT on B. cinerea, including inhibition to spore germination and mycelial growth, were highly improved compared with those of the WT. Our research indicates that the biocontrol effect of Streptomyces can be highly improved by transforming the exogenous resistance gene, i.e. chit42 from Trichoderma, which not only enhances the production of antibiotics, but also provides a supplementary function by degrading the cell walls of the pathogens.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the mechanism of all-trans retinoic acid(atRA) to inhibit the adipogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells(BMSCs).Methods Rat BMSCs were isolated,incubated and induced to differentiate into adipocytes.AtRA at high concentration(0.1-5.0 μmol / L) was added to the medium for adipogenic induction.The morphologic changes of BMSCs during differentiation were observed under a light microscope.The effect of atRA on the adipogenic differentiation was analyzed by oil red O staining.The expression of retinoic acid receptors α and γ(RARα and RARγ),CCAAT / enhancer binding protein a(CEBPα) and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor γ2(PPARγ2) was analyzed by realtime PCR.Results At the concentration of 0.1-5.0 μmol / L,atRA inhibited rBMSCs from differentiating into adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner.The fat content in differentiated cells was decreased along with the increase of atRA concentration(P < 0.05).Compared with the control group(without adding atRA),the mRNA expression levels of CEBPα and PPARγ2 were decreased significantly in the atRA groups(P < 0.05).Compared with the control group,the mRNA expression of RARα in the atRA group(1.0 μmol / L) was not significantly different(0.008 4 ± 0.001 9 vs 0.009 1 ± 0.001 3,P > 0.05),while the mRNA expression of RARγ significantly was increased(0.022 6 ± 0.001 2 vs 0.053 1 ± 0.002 3,P < 0.01).Conclusion AtRA(0.1-5.0 μmol/L) can inhibit the adipogenic differentiation of rBMSCs by up-regulating the expression of RARγ and down-regulating the expression of CEBPα and PPARγ2.",

        "abstract": "538 Background: Overexpression of enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), a key component of polycomb proteins, has been linked to aggressive tumor behavior for breast cancer. In vitro, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) transcriptionally activates EZH2 and promotes breast tumor initiating cells progression. Here, we characterized the clinicopathological effect of HIF-1α and EZH2 in breast cancer patients. Methods: Tumor specimens from 410 luminal subtype breast cancer patients were used to construct tissue microarray. EZH2 and HIF-1α level were examined by immunohistochemistry staining and Western blot analysis. With the 5-year follow up, the prognostic effect of EZH2 was subjected to multivariate analysis. Results: EZH2 and HIF-1α were highly expressed in 99 (24.1%) and 272 (70.6%) patients, respectively. EZH2 overexpression was associated with high histological grade (P=0.030), lymphatic invasion (P=0.025), HER2 overexpression (P=0.005) and hypoxic condition (Pu003c0.001). Forced expression of EZH2 pr...",

        "abstract": "Nonylphenol (NP) is a persistent organic pollutant (POP) that has potential for neurotoxicity. The central nervous system (CNS) of fetus and child is highly sensitive to POPs, with environmental NP exposure, in particular, receiving increasing attention. Microglia (MG) are vital resident immune cells in CNS that defend against exogenous chemicals. This makes them a potentially target of NP. We sought to explore the effects of maternal exposure to NP during pregnancy and lactation on MG in the offspring hippocampus, the production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by MG, and the associated underlying mechanisms. We found that maternal exposure to NP activated MG and increased the production of NO and PGE2 in the offspring hippocampus. Nuclear translocation of p65 was found to co-localize with hippocampal MG. Activation of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB and Nrf2 signaling were observed in the offspring hippocampus. Interestingly, the inhibition of TLR4 signaling with CLI-095 partly inhibited NP-induced NO and PGE2 expression in BV2, a MG cell line. Together, our results suggested that maternal exposure to NP might increase the production of NO and PGE2 by over-activated MG in the offspring hippocampus. TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB and Nrf2 signaling pathways may be involved in the activation of MG and the increased production of NO and PGE2.",

        "abstract": "Adequate thyroid hormone is critical for cerebellar development. Developmental hypothyroidism induced by iodine deficiency during the perinatal period results in permanent impairments of cerebellar development with an unclear mechanism. In the present study we investigated effects of perinatal iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism on cerebellar cell apoptosis, doublecortin (Dcx) and reelin. Apoptosis is an essential part of neural development. Dcx and reelin are two important molecules involved in neuronal migration, structure, and development in cerebellum.Two developmental rat models were created by administering dam rats with either iodine-deficient diet or propylthiouracil (PTU, 5 ppm or 15 ppm)-added drinking water from gestational day (GD) 6 until postnatal day (PND) 28. TUNEL assay and protein levels of Dcx and reelin in cerebella were assessed on PND14, 21 and 28.Apoptotic cells were increased in the iodine-deficient and PTU-treated rats. Dcx protein levels in the cerebella of iodine-deficient and PTU-treated rats were significantly downregulated on PND14. Interestingly, iodine deficiency and PTU treatment upregulated the levels of Dcx protein on PND21 and 28. Reelin expressions in iodine-deficient and PTU-treated rats were significantly decreased on PND14 and 21. On PND28, reelin expressions of three treated groups were still lower than control group, although without significant difference.These findings may implicate alterations in cell apoptosis and levels of Dcx and reelin in the impairments of cerebellar development induced by developmental iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism.",

        "abstract": "Distinct opioid receptor agonists have been proved to induce differential patterns of ERK activation, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report that Ser363 in the δ-opioid receptor (δOR) determines the different abilities of the δOR agonists DPDPE and TIPP to activate ERK by G-protein- or β-arrestin-dependent pathways. Although both DPDPE and TIPP activated ERK1/2, they showed different temporal, spatial and desensitization patterns of ERK activation. We show that that DPDPE employed G protein as the primary mediator to activate the ERK cascade in an Src-dependent manner, whereas TIPP mainly adopted a β-arrestin1/2-mediated pathway. Moreover, we found that DPDPE gained the capacity to adopt the β-arrestin1/2-mediated pathway upon Ser363 mutation, accompanied by the same pattern of ERK activation as that induced by TIPP. Additionally, we found that TIPP- but not DPDPE-activated ERK could phosphorylate G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 and β-arrestin1. However, such functional differences of ERK disappeared with the mutation of Ser363. Therefore, the present study reveals a crucial role for Ser363 in agonist-specific regulation of ERK activation patterns and functions.",

The detecting of targets through wall is an important application based on UWB-SP Radar. As the SEABED algorithm (a new target localization and identification algorithm) based on the UWB-SP Radar is not applicable for that application, this paper proposes a new algorithm to offset the influence brought from the wall firstly and then obtain the image of targets behind the wall by using the SEABED algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can remove the effect of the wall visibly and the imaging results can estimate the shape of targets well.",

        "abstract": "Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs) are a heterogeneous group of rare tumors. Many issues in terms of epidemiologic features, pathogenesis, and treatment of GEP-NENs are still under discussion. Our study aimed to analyze the clinicopathologic characteristics and prognosis of Chinese patients with GEP-NENs.Complete clinicopathologic data and survival information of 1183 patients with GEP-NENs treated between 2005 and 2015 were collected from five medical centers in Guangdong Province, China. Patient survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed using the log-rank test; prognostic factors were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model.The most common tumor location was the rectum (37.4%), followed by the pancreas (28.1%), stomach (20.7%), small intestine (7.2%), appendix (3.4%), and colon (3.3%). After initial definitive diagnosis, 1016 (85.9%) patients underwent surgery. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates for the entire cohort were 87.9%, 78.5%, and 72.8%, respectively. The 3-year OS rates of patients with G1, G2, and G3 tumors were 93.1%, 82.7%, and 43.1%, respectively (P < 0.001). The 3-year OS rates of patients with stage I, II, III, and IV tumors were 96.0%, 87.3%, 64.0%, and 46.8%, respectively (P < 0.001). Patients with distant metastasis who underwent palliative surgery had a longer survival than those who did not (P = 0.003). Similar survival benefits of palliative surgery were observed in patients with neuroendocrine tumor (P = 0.031) or neuroendocrine carcinoma (P = 0.046). In multivariate analysis, age, grade, N category, M category, and surgery were found to be independent prognostic factors.Patients with GEP-NENs who are women, younger than 50 years old, have smaller tumor size, have lower tumor grade, have lower T/N/M category, and who undergo surgery can have potentially longer survival time. Our data showed that surgery can improve the prognosis of GEP-NEN patients with distant metastasis. However, randomized controlled trials need to be conducted to establish the optimal criteria for selecting patients to undergo surgery.",

        "abstract": "Iodine deficiency (ID) during early pregnancy has an adverse effect on children's psychomotor and motor function but the mechanism has not been clarified. Therefore, our aim was to study the effect of maternal marginal ID on cerebellar neurodevelopment and the underlying mechanism. After obtaining marginal ID rats, we examined interactions between Bergmann glia cells (BGs) and Purkinje cells (PCs) using immunofluorescence and expression of the glutamate transporter and receptor by western blot. Our results showed that marginal ID reduced the number of contacted points between BGs and PCs, and disturbed expression of the glutamate transporter and receptor. Our results support the hypothesis that marginal ID inhibits interactions of BGs-PCs, which may be involved in abnormal regulation of the glutamate transporter and receptor.",

        "abstract": " The  (CLIP) score is commonly used for prognosis prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The CLIP includes the Child-Pugh grade, which is relatively subjective, for hepatic encephalopathy assessment. A newly developed scoring system called albumin-bilirubin grade (ALBI grade), consists of albumin and bilirubin to assess liver function reserve objectively. Here, we substituted the ALBI grade for the Child-Pugh grade to establish the ALBI-CLIP scoring system and validated its prognostic value in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients treated with trans-catheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy.  We retrospectively analyzed HBV-related HCC patients who received TACE therapy. Baseline characteristics were collected and evaluated to classify patients according to ALBI-CLIP, CLIP and TNM systems. Univariate analyses using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test, as well as multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards regression model, were conducted to detect independent prognostic factors for overall survival. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and a likelihood ratio test (LRT) were both utilized to compare the values of ALBI-CLIP, CLIP and TNM staging systems in predicting survival.  With a total of 389 patients included in the current study, 301 (77.4%) and 88 (22.6%) were classified as Child-Pugh grade A and B, respectively. However, 152 (39.1%), 227 (58.4%) and 10 (2.5%) patients were correspondingly classified into ALBI grade 1, 2 and 3. The areas under the curves of ALBI-CLIP, CLIP and TNM systems were 0.804, 0.778 and 0.734, respectively, for predicting 3-month survival; 0.796, 0.778 and 0.733, respectively, for 6-month survival; 0.697, 0.687 and 0.644, respectively, for 1-year survival; and 0.618, 0.612 and 0.569, respectively, for 2-year survival. The LRT indicated that the ALBI-CLIP and the CLIP had similar values of χ and Akaike information criterion (AIC) while the TNM system had the smallest χ value (χ = 12.1, 11.9, 10.5; AIC = 2620.2, 2620.5, 2621.1 for ALBI-CLIP, CLIP and TNM, respectively).  In conclusion, our present study suggested that the ALBI-CLIP scoring system retained the prognostic value of the CLIP in HBV-related HCC treated with TACE therapy.",

Peracetic acid treatment 96 h before challenge inoculation induced significant contents change of both total and soluble calcium in true leaves of eggplant resistant cultivar Xi'anluqie and susceptible cultivar Liaoqie4. For both cultivars, the calcium temporl contents changes in the leaves of different positions reflected the pathway of signal transduction related to induced resistance within plants. After challenge inoculation, total and soluble Ca~(2+) content change more greatly in the induced eggplant than in the control, derivational change of calcium contents in eggplant leaves led to the change of PAL、PPO、POD、SOD. changed activities of which built up eggplant resistance against verticillium wilt, Ca~(2+) content change、defensive enzyme activity and eggplant resistance level showed the positive correlation. therefore Ca~(2+) was presumed to participate induction of eggplant verticillium wilt defensive response through signalling, activated those defensive enzymes to improve host resistance to verticillum eggplant wilt.",

The biologically active form of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) plays a key role in the development of lung fibrosis. CD36 is involved in the transformation of latent TGF-beta1 (L-TGF-beta1) to active TGF-beta1. The antagonistic effect of the synthetic peptide was analyzed by the administration of CD36 (93-110) synthetic peptide to the silicosis model of mice. The hydroxyproline content of the silica + CD36 (93-110) synthetic peptide group was significantly lower than that of the other experimental groups [silica and silica + CD36 (208-225) synthetic peptide groups] (p < .05). Inflammation, fibrotic degree and distribution of collagen fibers in silicotic nodules of the silica + CD36 (93-110) synthetic peptide group were less than those of the other experimental groups. The expressions of collagen I and III of the silica + CD36 (93-110) synthetic peptide group were significantly lower than those of the other experimental groups (p < .05). CD36 (93-110) synthetic peptide reduced the tissue fibrotic pathologies and collagen accumulation in the silicosis model of mice, resulting in the decreased severity of silica-induced lung fibrosis.",

        "abstract": "1,3-β-glucan is considered a fungal biomarker and exposure to this agent induces lung inflammation. Previous studies have shown that 1,3-β-glucan affects Th1 and Th2 immune responses. Interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, as typical anti-inflammatory cytokines, suppress the Th1 immune response. To investigate the effects of 1,3-β-glucan on the secretion of cytokines in co-cultured mouse macrophages and lymphocytes in vitro, mice were exposed to 1,3-β-glucan or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by intratracheal instillation. Following extraction and co-culture of macrophages and lymphocytes, which were treated with or without 1,3-β-glucan in vitro, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the levels of cytokines and real-time reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to investigate the mRNA expression of forkhead box p3 (Foxp3) in the cells. We showed that 1,3-β-glucan exposure in vitro decreased the secretion of Th1 cytokines and increased the secretion of Th2 cytokines in the culture media. Furthermore, 1,3-β-glucan exposure in vitro increased the secretion of IL-10 and TGF-β in the culture media. According to these results, 1,3-β-glucan exposure in vitro is suggested to promote the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, which may lead to a decrease in the levels of Th1 cytokines and an increase in the levels of Th2 cytokines. 1,3-β-glucan is suggested to induce regulatory lymphocytes, which partly contributes to an increased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines in co-cultured mouse macrophages and lymphocytes in vitro.",

After sequenced,the reconstructed expression vectors were constructed by enzyme digestion and cloning into expression vector pGEX-5X-2. Then the reconstructed vectors were transformed into E.coli BL21. Recombinant GST fusion proteins were expressed via the induction of IPTG and purified through GST affinity columns. Results The sequences of cloned mouse CD36 gene segments were identical with GenBank reported. A protein band of 28.5 kDa appeared on SDS-PAGE gel after the expressed GST fusion proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Then the expressed fusion proteins were purified to high purity. Conclusion The mouse CD36 gene segments have been synthesized and efficiently expressed in E.coli BL21,and the GST fused target proteins have been purified to high purity.",

        "abstract": "A rice spotted-leaf mutant was isolated from an ethane methyl sulfonate (EMS) -induced IR64 mutant bank. The mutant, designated as spl30 (spotted-leaf30), displayed normal green leaf color under shade but exhibited red-brown lesions under natural summer field conditions. Initiation of the lesions was induced by light and the symptom was enhanced at 33 (°) C relative to 26 (°) C. Histochemical staining did not show cell death around the red-brown lesions. Chlorophyll contents in the mutant were significantly lower than those of the wild type while the ratio of chlorophyll a/b remained the same, indicating that spl30 was impaired in biosynthesis or degradation of chlorophyll. Disease reaction patterns of the mutant to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae were largely unchanged to most races tested except for a few strains. Genetic analysis showed that the mutation was controlled by a single recessive gene, tentatively named spl30(t), which co-segregated with RM15380 on chromosome 3, and was delimited to a 94 kb region between RM15380 and RM15383. Spl30(t) is likely a novel rice spotted-leaf gene since no other similar genes have been identified near the chromosomal region. The genetic data and recombination populations provided in this study will enable further fine-mapping and cloning of the gene.",
