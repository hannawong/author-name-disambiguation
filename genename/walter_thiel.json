All molecules are treated uniformly at the Hartree-Fock level using effective core potentials and polarized double-zeta basis sets for the valence electrons. The calculated vibration-rotation interaction constants, l -doubling constants, ground-state rotational constants, sextic centrifugal distortion constants, anharmonicity constants and anharmonic resonance parameters are compared with the available experimental data. The agreement is generally satisfactory, except when there are complications due to resonances. Many spectroscopic constants are predicted which have not been measured, including those for the unknown SnH 3 F molecule.",

New or revised assignments are suggested for coronene and corannulene. Based on the results for the reference molecules and for C 60 , MNDO is expected to overestimate the vibrational frequencies of the unknown clusters by 10% and to yield reasonable intensity patterns. Calculated infrared spectra are shown and discussed for 12 carbon clusters, with particular emphasis on those which might be observable spectroscopically. The zero-point vibrational energies and the entropy contributions to the free enthalpy are only of minor importance for the thermodynamic stabilities of different clusters.",

The potential parameters are optimized by fitting to the experimental band centers. The Fermi resonance between the Si-H stretching and bending motions is insignificant due to cancellation of the contributions from kinetic and potential terms. This suggests a slow redistribution of vibrational energy between these two degrees of freedom and induces local mode character of respective vibrations. Band intensities are calculated by using ab initio one-and three-dimensional dipole moment surfaces (DMS). These agree reasonably well with the observations. The successful reproduction of relative intensities between the (n1 - 1)v1 + 2v5 stretching-bending combination bands and the n1v1 stretching bands establishes the importance of the bending motion in the multidimensional DMS for intensity investigations.",

        "abstract": "The infrared spectrum of short-lived BiH 3 has been studied by Fourier transform technique. The BiH stretching bands \u03bd 1 / \u03bd 3 at 1733.2546/1734.4671 cm \u22121 and the bending fundamentals \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 at 726.6992/751.2385 cm \u22121 have been measured with a resolution of 5.5 and 6.6 \u00d7 10 \u22123 cm \u22121 , respectively. The spectra were analyzed using different reductions of the rovibrational Hamiltonian accounting for the numerous resonance interactions in particular within the strongly Coriolis-coupled bending dyad. About 1150 and 980 transitions belonging to the \u03bd 1 / \u03bd 3 and \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 bands were fitted with an rms deviation of 0.62 and 0.53 \u00d7 10 \u22123 cm \u22121 , respectively. High-level ab initio calculations at the coupled cluster CCSD(T) level with an energy-consistent small-core pseudopotential and large basis sets were carried out to determine the equilibrium structure, the anharmonic force field, and the associated spectroscopic constants of BiH 3 . The theoretical results are in good agreement with the available experimental data. Keywords Infrared spectroscopy High resolution Bismuthine ab initio calculations 1 Introduction Hydrides X H 3 of the group 15 elements N, P, As, and Sb belong to the simplest examples of pyramidal, oblate symmetric top molecules, and their vibrational spectra have been studied in the past in great detail. The heavier ones, X = P to Sb, gradually approach the spherical top limit, the sphericity parameter \u03b3 =2( C 0 \u2212 B 0 )/( C 0 + B 0 ) dropping, in absolute value, from \u22120.127 in PH 3 and \u22120.070 in AsH 3 to \u22120.052 in SbH 3 . The heaviest homologue of the X H 3 series, bismuthine BiH 3 , would be supposedly even closer to an accidentally spherical, symmetric top. However, until recently this molecule could not be investigated because of unsurmountable difficulties to make it, and neither its vibrational energy levels nor its structure could be evaluated experimentally. Although an admittedly very demanding synthesis of chemically and photochemically unstable BiH 3 has been reported in 1961 by Amberger [1] , attempts subsequently undertaken in different laboratories to repeat this synthesis failed. We have recently been able to make enough BiH 3 , to study its spectra [2] and to determine its effective and equilibrium structures [3] . The HBiH bond angle, 90.32\u00b0 [3] , was found to be indeed very close to 90\u00b0, and accordingly the calculated sphericity parameter, \u03b3 =\u22120.015, is much closer to zero than for any other pyramidal symmetric top molecule. Following the preliminary study [2] we now give a full account of the infrared (IR) spectrum of BiH 3 studied with high resolution, 5.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 cm \u22121 ( \u03bd 1 , \u03bd 3 ) and 6.6 \u00d7 10 \u22123 cm \u22121 ( \u03bd 2 , \u03bd 4 , respectively). Moreover, the rovibrational analysis of these spectra will be presented. The ground state combination differences (GSCD) which were used to determine the ground state rotational, centrifugal distortion, and resonance interaction parameters of BiH 3 [3] are based on the results of these analyses. As in the case of the near-spherical oblate tops PH 3 [4] , AsH 3 [5] , and SbH 3 [6] , the problem of reductions of the rovibrational Hamiltonian [7,8] is of great importance, and becomes dramatic for BiH 3 because of the closeness to the spherical top limit. The experimental part of the present contribution is aimed at determining vibrational energies of the \u03bd 1 \u2013 \u03bd 4 fundamentals and the rotational structures of the 1 1 , 2 1 , 3 1 , and 4 1 states by means of high resolution IR spectra. We have made BiH 3 , transferred it into a long path cell, and measured the FTIR spectra. These spectra were subjected to a line-by-line analysis to provide independently both GSCD employed for the ground state analysis [3] and upper state energies to be fitted by suitable models. The experimental work has been accompanied and guided by high-level ab initio calculations on BiH 3 . Our initial communication [2] contained a brief comparison of the measured data with the best theoretical predictions then available, and the agreement between experiment and theory served as a strong argument to confirm the detection of BiH 3 and to support the experimental assignments. This theoretical work has now been extended and improved in a systematic manner using a variety of correlation treatments, basis sets, and pseudopotentials, partly in combination with core polarization potentials and counterpoise corrections [9] . In this paper we shall focus on our best current theoretical results for the equilibrium geometry and the spectroscopic parameters of BiH 3 and compare them with the experimental results. 2 Experimental details Bismuthine BiH 3 , which is a highly reactive, short-lived species rapidly decomposing above \u221235 \u00b0C to give Bi (deposited on all surfaces) and H 2 , was prepared as described in [1] and [2] . Since no multipass cell could be employed owing to the immediate deposition of black Bi on the metal-coated mirrors, spectra were studied using a double-jacketed glass cell of 1.2 m length with NaCl windows and external cooling. The wall temperature was adjusted to \u221242 \u00b0C. The cell had an inner diameter of 70 mm and was placed in the external parallel beam of a Bruker 120 HR interferometer in a set-up similar to that described in [10] . The interferometer was equipped with a globar source and a KBr beam splitter. Spectra were recorded in the 600\u20131195 cm \u22121 region for the \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 bands (spectrum 1) and a 8.3 \u03bcm low pass optical filter was employed to eliminate radiation >1200 cm \u22121 . An MCT 600 detector was used, and the resolution (1/maximum optical path difference) adjusted to 6.6 \u00d7 10 \u22123 cm \u22121 . Altogether 76 scans were coadded, and the absorption cell refilled after 10\u201320 scans. The total pressure in the cell was ca. 100 Pa. Calibration of spectrum 1 was done by comparison with H 2 O lines [11,12] in the 1400 cm \u22121 region. These had been measured in a wider range spectrum of BiH 3 which was otherwise similar to spectrum 1 and provided calibrated BiH 3 lines in the \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 region. Wavenumber precision is 0.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 cm \u22121 . For the \u03bd 1 / \u03bd 3 band region a spectrum was measured in the 1200\u20132100 cm \u22121 range (spectrum 2). A 4.2 \u03bcm low pass filter was used, and an MCT 800 detector installed. The total pressure in the cell was ca. 50 Pa, and in total 30 scans were collected, with refill of the cell about every 10 scans. A resolution (1/MOPD) of 5.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 cm \u22121 was chosen. Calibration was performed with H 2 O lines in the 1600\u20131650 cm \u22121 region using reference data from [11] with correction from [12] . 3 Description and assignment of the spectra 3.1 The \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 band system The \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 band system is located in the 650\u2013850 cm \u22121 region. This band system is illustrated in Fig. 1 . Of the Q branches, those of the lower energy component ( \u03bd 2 ) and those of the higher energy component ( \u03bd 4 ) extend towards opposite directions. This is indicative of strong x , y -Coriolis interactions. In agreement with the expected effect on the intensity perturbations for a positive sign of the product M 2 \u00d7 \u03b6 2,4 \u00d7 M 4 the Q R and Q Q series of \u03bd 2 are intensity enhanced while the Q P series are depleted. For \u03bd 4 the P P and P Q branches are particularly strong while the R R and R Q branches (except the Coriolis-unaffected R Q 0 branch) are weak. Owing to the strength of the Coriolis resonance the \u03bd 2 and \u03bd 4 bands have to be analyzed jointly. Since the ground state constants of BiH 3 were unknown when the analyses were started, no use could here be made of GSCD. We therefore based the analyses on ab initio predictions, [13] , of the band centers, on estimated B 0 and C 0 constants, and we used diagnostic A 1 A 2 splittings of Q (PQR) 3 lines of \u03bd 2 and P (PQR) 3 lines of \u03bd 4 . Moreover we found that the \u03bd 1 / \u03bd 3 band whose analysis is reported below furnished more easily than \u03bd 2 and \u03bd 4 enough GSCD which helped to advance at a later stage with the assignment of the \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 band using GSCD. The next step in the assignment procedure was to progress in an interactive fashion consisting of assignment, fit and prediction using a suitable program. This was kindly supplied by Professor L. Halonen [14] . This program enabled us in particular to assign also the numerous forbidden but perturbation-allowed lines with \u0394 K \u2a7d12. Altogether 975 lines of the \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 bands were eventually assigned, of which 209 were perturbation-allowed, and J max was 18. For the Q branches we can summarize that the Q Q branches of \u03bd 2 are degraded both in J and K to small wavenumber. Of the Q branches belonging to \u03bd 4 , the R Q 0 branch is regularly degraded to large wavenumber and appears quite compact extending over ca. 2 cm \u22121 . The P Q and R Q branches for K \u2a7e1 are widely spread. The P Q branches are K -degraded to small and J -degraded to large wavenumber. Both the K - and J -structures of the R Q branches ( K \u2a7e1) extend towards large wavenumber. 3.2 The \u03bd 1 / \u03bd 3 band system Although the centers of the A 1 - and E -type bands \u03bd 1 and \u03bd 3 , respectively, are very close, \u0394 \u03bd =1.2 cm \u22121 , they appear almost unaffected by each other owing to the small values of the x -, y -, and z -axis Coriolis constants, \u03b6 1,3 x , y =(\u2212)0.0175 and \u03b6 3 z =\u22120.0089. Therefore, the rovibrational analysis and supply of 1009 GSCD of the \u03bd 1 / \u03bd 3 bands was much easier than for the \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 bands, see above. An overview of the \u03bd 1 / \u03bd 3 bands is shown in Fig. 2 . The strong Q Q branches region is accompanied by pairs of prominent J clusters in the P and R branches. The Q R/ R R clusters collapse to one single J cluster at large wavenumber while the two clusters in the P branch region are distinctly and increasingly separated. The Q Q branches of \u03bd 1 are both J - and K -degraded to small wavenumber and form a high wavenumber edge at 1733.2 cm \u22121 . This is however partly buried under the P Q and R Q lines of \u03bd 3 . The R Q branches of the \u03bd 3 band are both J - and K -degraded to small wavenumber while the P Q branches are J -degraded to small and K -degraded to large wavenumber. Thus, the P Q lines are at larger wavenumber than their R Q counterparts for given J and K . Additional hints for the assignment were found: e.g., A 1 A 2 splittings of the P (PQR) 3 and Q (PQR) 3 lines. There is no substantial global perturbation as in the \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 band system although the Q P and R R lines appear stronger than the corresponding Q R and P P lines. The spectrum was assigned up to J \u2032 max =18 using both GSCD and an interactive procedure as for the \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 bands. Altogether 1152 transitions have been assigned, of which 422 were normally forbidden, but perturbation-allowed, with \u0394 K \u2a7d8. Of the lines which were not due to residual H 2 O in the interferometer, a very large portion (>90%) was found to belong to the \u03bd 1 / \u03bd 3 fundamental bands of BiH 3 . A similarly large portion of assignments had been reached for the \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 bands. 4 Data fit 4.1 General aspects and reductions While the fit of the \u03bd 1 and \u03bd 3 data to conventional diagonal and off-diagonal (resonance) Hamiltonian parameters posed no particular problem owing to the relative weakness of the interactions, the strongly x , y -Coriolis interacting v 2 =1 and v 4 =1 levels have to be treated more thoroughly to account for possible redundancies of parameters. These have to be considered in the fitting procedure. Such redundancy problems are common for near-spherical symmetric top molecules. They have been treated both theoretically ( [8] , see [7] for further references) and experimentally for several oblate, e.g., pyramidal ( X H 3 ) species and, to a lesser extent, also for prolate tops like FClO 3 . The problem of redundant parameters has been theoretically addressed, in particular for isolated A 1 (e.g., the ground) and E vibrational states. Sets of unitary equivalent parameters, and relations for their interconversion, have been developed. Less work has been done on (strongly) interacting states. Since BiH 3 is closer to the spherical top limit than any other of the previously investigated tops with C 3 v symmetry [2] , ambiguities due to redundancy occur here with particular strength. In brief, the theory of reductions of the rovibrational Hamiltonian for strongly x , y -Coriolis interacting systems [7,8] states that there are four correlated parameters which should not be freely refined. In the first form of the model these are \u03b6 s , t y , \u03b6 K , st y , d t , and \u03b1 s , t ( BBK ) ; in the second form these are \u03b6 K , st y , \u03b1 s , t ( BB ) , q t , and d t . These parameters should be constrained either to zero or to values which have been obtained otherwise, e.g., by ab initio calculations. The meaning of most of these interaction parameters is evident from the compilation of customary relevant matrix elements given in the Appendix. Table 1 lists the parameters for the different models relevant in the present study. There is no similar rule for higher order terms. These become important for the analysis of very precise (e.g., Fourier transform, or laser) data, and when transitions with large values of the total angular momentum quantum number are probed. It has been well established for isolated states of near-spherical top molecules that different reductions of the rovibrational Hamiltonian will lead to fits of equivalent reproduction of the observations, and the different parameter sets can be perfectly converted into parameter sets belonging to different reductions [15] . There have been only few linear combinations mentioned for x , y -Coriolis coupled pairs [7] , e.g. (1) q 4 (1) \u2212q 4 (2) =\u03b1 2 B(1) \u2212\u03b1 2 B(2) =\u22122[\u03b1 4 B(1) \u2212\u03b1 4 B(2) ]. This means e.g., that the sum ( \u03b1 2 B +2 \u03b1 4 B ) should not depend on the chosen reduction. 4.2 The \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 bands We have fitted the wavenumbers of the assigned transitions with three different Hamiltonian models. Model 1 ( Table 1 ) violates the suggestions of Lobodenko et al. [8] but has the advantage that it fits the observations significantly better than any other model that we have tested. Model 2 is closely related to that recently employed to fit the \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 bands of SbH 3 [6] . This molecule is\u2014spectroscopically\u2014the closest relative of BiH 3 , and the parameter set for SbH 3 as used by Fusina and DiLonardo [6] is also gathered in Table 1 . Both our model 2 and the related model used for SbH 3 do not conform with the restrictions implied by Lobodenko et al. [8] . The rms deviation of the data fit according to model 2, 0.561 \u00d7 10 \u22123 cm \u22121 , is rather close to that of model 1, 0.527 \u00d7 10 \u22123 cm \u22121 . The total number of refined parameters for models 1\u20133, 33, 31, and 32, respectively, is also very similar. Additional parameters were tested but rejected because they both did not improve the rms deviation of the fits significantly and their refined values did not exceed three of their standard deviations. Finally model 3 obeying the restrictions proposed by form 2 according to Lobodenko et al. [8] was also tried. Although this model was capable of fitting all observations with a fully satisfactory rms deviation, 0.637 \u00d7 10 \u22123 cm \u22121 , the residuals were larger than in models 1 and 2. Moreover occasionally, when two or more basis states contributed almost equally to the actual rovibrational states having heavily mixed wavefunctions, relabelling of those attached dominant transition which fluctuated from model to model became necessary. All fits were performed with the same data set and by constraining the ground state parameters to the values reported in [3] . For convenience the ground state parameters are set out in Table 2 . A non-linear least-squares program for Coriolis-coupled A 1 and E vibrational systems [14,16,17] was used. The parameters obtained in the fits according to models 1\u20133 are gathered in Table 3 . 4.3 The \u03bd 1 / \u03bd 3 bands Contrary to the \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 bands the Bi\u2013H stretching bands \u03bd 1 / \u03bd 3 reveal only weak intervibrational Coriolis coupling, |\u221a2B\u03a9\u03b6 1,3 y |=0.0656 cm \u22121 . Therefore, restrictions for the Hamiltonian model as relevant for the \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 band system are not needed. We have fitted the measured transition wavenumbers of the \u03bd 1 and \u03bd 3 bands to altogether 37 refined parameters. We have used the same ground state parameters ( Table 2 ) and fit program [14,16,17] as for the \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 bands. The result of the fit is presented in Table 4 . The rms deviation of the fit, 0.615 \u00d7 10 \u22123 cm \u22121 , corresponds to the precision of the measurement. Experimental transition wavenumbers of the \u03bd 1 \u2013 \u03bd 4 bands have been deposited as supplementary material and are available on ScienceDirect. 4.4 Band simulations A diagnostic proof of the correctness of the rovibrational analysis of a band is the comparison of the observed with a simulated spectrum. We have used for this purpose the same program as for the fits [14,16] and simulated both the full \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 and \u03bd 1 / \u03bd 3 bands, Figs. 1 and 2 , and details of these bands. In Fig. 3 we illustrate the \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 bands in the region of the \u03bd 2 band center while Fig. 4 shows the R (7) cluster of the \u03bd 1 / \u03bd 3 bands. In all spectral regions the agreement between observation and simulation is most satisfactory and gives credit to the correctness of the analysis. For the simulations we have used the parameter sets given in Table 3 , model 1, and in Table 4 . Since both band systems are involved in x , y -Coriolis interactions we can only determine the sign of the product M s \u00d7 \u03b6 st y \u00d7 M t , where M is the transition moment of vibration s ( s =1 and 2) and t ( t =3 and 4), and \u03b6 st y the Coriolis constant. For the signs of \u03b6 13 y and \u03b6 24 y we have adopted those quoted in Tables 3 and 4 although these signs cannot be determined from the spectra and were arbitrarily chosen. These signs are however correlated with the signs of the higher order terms of the Coriolis interaction. The phase convention given by diLauro and Mills [18] has been used. It was possible to determine the sign of the products M s \u00d7 \u03b6 st y \u00d7 M t owing to intensity perturbations. With the signs of \u03b6 st y as given in Tables 3 and 4 , respectively, we have determined the following transition moment ratios. M 1 :M 3 =(\u03b5 1 )0.67 M 2 :M 4 =(\u03b5 2 )1.5 \u03b5 1 and \u03b5 2 are the signs of the transition moment ratios and positive for the chosen signs of \u03b6 st y , Tables 4 and 3 , \u2212 and +, respectively. We estimate the uncertainties of the transition moment ratios to 20% or less. 5 Theoretical section Quantum-chemical calculations with a formally non-relativistic Hamiltonian were carried out at the correlated levels of second-order M\u00f8ller\u2013Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) [19] and coupled cluster theory with single and double excitations [20] augmented by a perturbational estimate of the effects of connected triple excitations (CCSD(T)) [21] . These calculations were performed with the GAUSSIAN03 [22] and MOLPRO2002 [23,24] program systems. The Bi atom was described by a scalar-relativistic small-core pseudopotential [25] replacing 60 inner-core electrons (1 s \u20134 f ). This pseudopotential was used in conjunction with a (12 s 12 p 10 d 5 f 3 g 2 h )/ [8 s 8 p 7 d 5 f 3 g 2 h ] set of contracted Gaussian-type orbitals [9] . The hydrogen atoms were represented by the augmented correlation-consistent polarized valence quadruple-zeta basis aug-cc-pVQZ [26] . Spherical harmonics were used throughout. All 26 explicitly treated outer-core and valence electrons in BiH 3 were correlated. The molecular geometry of BiH 3 was optimized within the constraint of C 3 v point group symmetry. Analytic energy gradients as implemented in the GAUSSIAN03 program [22] were used at the MP2 level of theory, and numerical gradients were employed at the CCSD(T) level with the MOLPRO2002 program [23] . The largest gradient components at the stationary points were less than 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 au. At the computed equilibrium geometries, harmonic force fields were evaluated either analytically (MP2) or numerically in symmetry-adapted internal coordinates from CCSD(T) energies (step sizes 0.0075 Bohr for bond distances and 0.5\u00b0 for bond angles). The normal modes and the harmonic vibrational frequencies were obtained in the usual manner [27] . The CCSD(T) cubic and semidiagonal quartic normal coordinate force constants were determined with the use of a finite difference procedure [28] involving displacements along reduced normal coordinates (stepsize \u0394 q =0.03) and the calculation of purely numerical Cartesian second derivatives at these displaced geometries. The reader is referred to [9] for further details with respect to the calculation of the anharmonic force fields and the anharmonic spectroscopic constants. The quadratic and cubic normal coordinate force constants were converted to symmetry force constants using appropriate transformations [29] . The orientation of the BiH 3 molecule, the signs and phases of the normal modes, and the symmetry coordinates were chosen as defined in our previous work on PH 3 [30] . Table 5 lists the calculated vibrational parameters in BiH 3 which are the harmonic wavenumbers \u03c9 i ( i =1\u22124), the fundamental wavenumbers \u03bd i , the anharmonicity constants x ij and g tt \u2032 ( t , t \u2032 =3,4), the anharmonicity corrections \u03c9 i \u2212 \u03bd i , the Coriolis \u03b6 -constants, and the dipole moment derivatives M i =(\u2202 \u03bc \u03b1 /\u2202 Q i ) e ( \u03b1 = z for Q 1 and Q 2 ; \u03b1 = x for Q 3 a and Q 4 a ). For the sake of a convenient comparison with experiment, the Coriolis parameters \u221a2B e \u03a9 13 \u03b6 13 y and \u221a2B e \u03a9 24 \u03b6 24 y are also given ( \u03a9 ij = 1 2 [(\u03c9 i /\u03c9 j ) 1/2 +(\u03c9 j /\u03c9 i ) 1/2 ] ). Furthermore, calculated values of the equilibrium electric dipole moment \u03bc e are reported. The calculated (CCSD(T)) fundamental wavenumbers can be directly compared with the corresponding experimental data given in Table 3 ( \u03bd 2 =726.7 cm \u22121 , \u03bd 4 =751.2 cm \u22121 ) and 4 ( \u03bd 1 =1733.3 cm \u22121 , \u03bd 3 =1734.5 cm \u22121 ). The errors in the theoretical bending wavenumbers \u03bd 2 and \u03bd 4 are about as small as known from molecules consisting of light atoms (ca. 10 cm \u22121 or less), and the calculated difference \u03bd 4 \u2212 \u03bd 2 (22.8 cm \u22121 ) is reasonably close to experiment (24.5 cm \u22121 ). On the other hand, the errors in the theoretical stretching wavenumbers \u03bd 1 and \u03bd 3 (17.2 cm \u22121 and 25.7 cm \u22121 , respectively) are larger than those for \u03bd 2 and \u03bd 4 , and obviously they are also not uniform. Experimentally, \u03bd 1 and \u03bd 3 are almost degenerate ( \u03bd 3 \u2212 \u03bd 1 =1.2 cm \u22121 ). This near-degeneracy of the stretching fundamentals in BiH 3 is not reproduced in our CCSD(T) calculations which yield a splitting of 9.7 cm \u22121 . The anharmonicity corrections for the stretching wavenumbers are calculated to be quite similar (see Table 5 ) and are considered to be reliable. Therefore, we believe that the calculated difference \u03c9 3 \u2212 \u03c9 1 (11.5 cm \u22121 ) is significantly too large (by nearly 10 cm \u22121 ). The experimental Coriolis coupling constants \u03b6 t z ( t =3,4) may be derived from the Coriolis terms C\u03b6 t z (see Tables 3 and 4 ) by dividing them by the respective rotational constants C t . This results in \u03b6 3 z =\u22120.0089 and \u03b6 4 z =\u22120.4898 (model 1), \u22120.4877 (model 2), and \u22120.4876 (model 3). These observed values agree well with their theoretical counterparts (see Table 5 ). Under the adopted sign conventions \u03b6 13 y and \u03b6 24 y are predicted to be negative. Except for M 2 , all dipole derivatives are calculated to be positive (see Table 5 ). Therefore, we predict a positive intensity perturbation for the strong Coriolis interaction between \u03bd 2 and \u03bd 4 , and a negative intensity perturbation for the very weak Coriolis interaction between \u03bd 1 and \u03bd 3 , in complete agreement with experiment (see above). (Note that in our previous work [13] the calculated Coriolis coupling constants \u03b6 13 y and \u03b6 24 y in AsH 3 , 121 SbH 3 , 123 SbH 3 , and BiH 3 were erroneously assigned to be positive. Using the correct negative sign for these constants, the predicted sense of the intensity perturbations [13] is reversed and is then in agreement with the present study.) The calculated Coriolis terms \u221a2B e \u03a9 13 \u03b6 13 y and \u221a2B e \u03a9 24 \u03b6 24 y are reasonably close to their experimental counterparts (see Tables 3 and 4 ), especially to the values from model 2 and model 3 as far as the Coriolis interaction between \u03bd 2 and \u03bd 4 is concerned (see Tables 3 and 4 ). The theoretical ratios M 1 : M 3 =+0.973 and M 2 : M 4 =\u22121.879 are somewhat larger in absolute value than found experimentally (see above). The electric dipole moment \u03bc e calculated at the CCSD(T) level (1.004 D) is expected to be accurate to about 0.05 D. The positive sign of \u03bc e corresponds to a charge distribution in BiH 3 where the central atom carries a positive charge. Table 6 contains theoretical (CCSD(T)) quadratic and cubic force constants of BiH 3 in symmetry-adapted internal coordinates [30] . The specification t =3,4 for degenerate modes has been used instead of t =3 a , 4 a . The present symmetry force constants of BiH 3 may be compared with the analogous computational results of [13] which were obtained at lower theoretical levels. The theoretical cubic force field of BiH 3 was used to calculate the vibration\u2013rotation coupling constants \u03b1 i B and \u03b1 i C ( i =1\u20134) which are reported in Table 7 together with experimental data. The computed values for \u03b1 2 B and \u03b1 4 B do not include contributions from the strong \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 Coriolis interaction which is also true for the experimental values since this Coriolis interaction is treated explicitly as a non-diagonal term in models 1\u20133. However, the experimental parameters \u03b1 2 B and \u03b1 4 B are affected by the applied reduction [7] and thus cannot be directly compared with their theoretical counterparts (although the value of \u03b1 4 B from model 3 is close to the corresponding theoretical value, see Table 7 ). On the other hand, the sum 1 2 (\u03b1 2 B +2\u03b1 4 B ) does not depend on the chosen reduction [7] ; the corresponding theoretical sum exceeds the experimental one in absolute value by 25% (model 1) and 35% (model 3), respectively. This relatively large overestimate is at least partly due to cancellation effects ( \u03b1 2 B and \u03b1 4 B have opposite signs). Comparing the theoretical results for \u03b1 1 B , \u03b1 3 B , and \u03b1 i C ( i =1\u20134) with their experimental analogues from model 1 and model 3, the errors of the former amount to 2\u20137% and are thus as small as can be expected. For the sake of completeness, Table 7 also reports the CCSD(T) value of the \u2113-type-doubling constant q 4 . Again, this value necessarily differs from the reduction-dependent [7] experimental value. Furthermore, Table 7 contains the computed rotational constants B 0 , B e , C 0 , and C e which are close to their experimental counterparts, the relative errors being as small as 0.07\u20130.34%. The theoretical equilibrium rotational constants B e and C e were derived from the CCSD(T) equilibrium geometry in BiH 3 : r e =177.84 pm, \u2220 e =90.12\u00b0. The associated MP2 results are: r e =175.97 pm, \u2220 e =89.70\u00b0. The CCSD(T) equilibrium structure is in very good agreement with the experimental one [3] . 6 Discussion It is an important question whether the employed models for the \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 analysis, in particular model 1 which we favour because of the best reproduction of the data, Table 3 , are meaningful reductions, equivalent to others, and the vibration\u2013rotational parameters obtained thereby useful for the determination of the equilibrium rotational constants B e and C e . We can test the presumed equivalence by applying Eq. (1) , and we may compare experimental results with those of ab initio calculations ( Section 5 ). The merely weakly coupled \u03bd 1 / \u03bd 3 bands are not of similar relevance in this respect as the \u03bd 2 and \u03bd 4 bands are. Using the parameters gathered in Table 3 we obtain (in cm \u22121 ) for the differences q 4 (1) \u2212 q 4 (2) ; \u03b1 2 B (1) \u2212 \u03b1 2 B (2) ;\u22122[ \u03b1 4 B (1) \u2212 \u03b1 4 B (2) ] with: (a) (1)=model 3, (2)=model 1, Table 3 , \u22120.023478(23); \u22120.023446(36); \u22120.023343(45); (b) (1)=model 2, (2)=model 1, Table 3 , \u22120.023478(23); \u22120.023446(34); \u22120.022331(52). For case (a), models 1 and 3, the differences agree within 2 \u03c3 , but for case (b), models 1 and 2, only within 15 \u03c3 . Therefore, we conclude that models 1 and 3 are de facto equivalent and the \u03b1 parameters better suited to determine B e and C e than those of model 2 in spite of the good reproduction of the experimental data by the latter. Reasonable agreement is also found for the sum 1 2 [\u03b1 2 B +2\u03b1 4 B ] , \u22125.367 and \u22124.919 \u00d7 10 \u22123 cm \u22121 , for models 1 and 3, and for 1 2 [\u03b1 2 C +2\u03b1 4 C ] \u22120.857 and \u22120.726 \u00d7 10 \u22123 cm \u22121 , respectively. These sums are rather small owing to cancellation effects, Table 7 . The latter values are directly used for the determination of B e and C e from B 0 and C 0 . It is therefore no surprise that the B e and C e values obtained using the vibrational corrections according to models 1 and 3 are very close, Table 7 . They anyway depend more strongly on the much larger \u03b1 constants of the stretching motions \u03bd 1 and \u03bd 3 . For the comparison with the results of the ab initio calculations we have to consider that the theoretical \u03b1 B values for \u03bd 2 and \u03bd 4 given in Table 7 differ from the reduction-dependent experimental values \u03b1 \u0303 B by an additional term which is a product of the Coriolis interaction constant and the reduction parameter s , see [7] , Eqs. (122) and (123). These additional terms exactly cancel in the sum 1 2 [\u03b1 2 B +2\u03b1 4 B ] which thus affords a meaningful comparison between theory and experiment. The agreement is not perfect but again we point out that the values of 1 2 [\u03b1 2 B +2\u03b1 4 B ] and 1 2 [\u03b1 2 C +2\u03b1 4 C ] are small and of much less influence than the much larger \u03b1 1 and \u03b1 3 values. In summary both the comparison of models 1 and 3 of the \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 analysis and the comparison of the experimental parameters with their counterparts from ab initio calculations are in strong support of the meaningfulness and correctness of the rovibrational analysis and hence the reliability of the structure-relevant vibrational corrections of the rotational constants employed in our study of the ground state and the equilibrium structures of BiH 3 [3] . The closeness of the \u03bd 1 and \u03bd 3 band centers, Table 4 , and the small values of the z - and x , y -axis Coriolis interaction constants may suggest that already the 1 1 and 3 1 states of BiH 3 are close to the local mode limit. Normally X H 3 molecules exerting large X \u2013H anharmonicity, weak H\u2013 X / X \u2013H \u2032 coupling and possessing heavy X atoms approach the local mode limit only in multiply excited X \u2013H stretching states; SbH 3 is a typical example [14] . At the local mode limit not only the vibrational term values for the ( n 00 A 1 ) and ( n 00 E ) levels (here the 1 1 and 3 1 states; n =1) should be equal, and the Coriolis constants C\u03b6 z and B \u03a9 \u03b6 y zero, but also simple relations between \u03b1 constants should be valid: (2) \u03b1 (BB) =\u2212\u221a2q,\u03b1 (BC) =\u221a32r. We may compare the present values for the 1 1 and 3 1 states of BiH 3 with those of the (200 A 1 / E ) states determined recently for the first overtone [31] . These are given in parentheses: \u0394 \u03bd(A 1 \u2212E)=\u22121.22 (0.16) cm \u22121 , C\u03b6 z \u00d710 3 =\u221223.09 (\u22126.60) cm \u22121 , |B \u03a9 \u03b6 y |\u00d710 3 =46.39 (10.05) cm \u22121 , \u03b1 (BB) /q=\u22123.974 (\u22121.4188), \u03b1 (BC) /r=5.815 (5.582). The theoretical values for the two latter ratios are \u22121.41421 and 5.657, respectively. For an H X H angle of 90\u00b0 (BiH 3 , \u03b1 e =90.32\u00b0) the relation \u03b1 A 1 B =\u03b1 E B =\u03b1 A 1 C =\u03b1 E C should be fulfilled at the local mode limit [32] . The rms deviation of these parameters from the average value, 13.6%, is rather large in comparison to that of the first overtone, 5.0% [31] . All the findings argue against a typical local mode behaviour of the 1 1 and 3 1 states of BiH 3 . Acknowledgements We thank Professor L. Halonen, Helsinki, for access to a computer program.

        "abstract": "We report a theoretical study of the ground electronic state of BiH. The potential energy surface (PES) is obtained from coupled cluster CCSD(T) calculations with a large basis set (289 contracted Gaussian functions). The previously available quartic force field (P4) is extended by adding the dominant quintic and sextic stretching terms to yield improved potential functions in symmetry coordinates (P6) and Morse-type coordinates (M4). Second-order rovibrational perturbation calculations on the P4-PES and full variational calculations on the P6-PES and M4-PES yield almost identical vibrational term values which is rationalized by considering the local mode behavior of BiH and the Morse-type character of the M4-PES. The remaining deviations between the computed and observed vibrational term values must thus be caused by imperfections in the CCSD(T) surface. A refinement of this ab initio surface by a restrained fit to experimental data allows an essentially perfect reproduction of the observed vibrational term values. Variational calculations on this refined surface provide predictions for several overtone and combination bands that have not yet been observed.",

The ab initio PES was computed using the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ method at 30 840 geometries that cover the energy range up to 44 000 cm(-1) above equilibrium. Ro-vibrational energies of formaldehyde were determined variationally for this ab initio PES by means of the program TROVE [Theoretical ROtation-Vibration Energies; S. N. Yurchenko, W. Thiel, and P. Jensen, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 245, 126 (2007)]. The parameter values in the analytical representation of the PES were optimized in fittings to 319 ro-vibrational energies with J = 0, 1, 2, and 5. The initial parameter values in the fittings were those of the ab initio PES, the ro-vibrational eigenfunctions obtained from this PES served as a basis set during the fitting process, and constraints were imposed to ensure that the refined PES does not deviate unphysically from the ab initio one in regions of configuration space not sampled by the experimental data. The resulting refined PES, referred to as H(2)CO-2011, reproduces the available experimental J \u2264 5 data with a root-mean-square error of 0.04 cm(-1).",

PH2 molecules were produced in a molecular free-jet apparatus by laser vaporizing a silicon rod in the presence of phosphine (PH3) gas diluted in helium. The laser-induced fluorescence, from the excited A2A1 electronic state down to the ground electronic state, was dispersed and analyzed. Ten (upsilon1upsilon2upsilon3) vibrationally excited levels of the ground electronic state, with upsilon1 < or = 2, upsilon2 < or = 6, and upsilon3 = 0, have been observed. Ab initio potential-energy surfaces for the X2B1 and A2A1 electronic states have been calculated at 210 points. These two states correlate with a 2Pi(u) state at linearity and they interact by the Renner-Teller coupling and spin-orbit coupling. Using the ab initio potential-energy surfaces with our RENNER computer program system, the vibronic structure and relative intensities of the A2A1 --> X2B1 emission band system have been calculated in order to corroborate the experimental assignments.",

        "abstract": "Ab initio coupled cluster calculations with single and double substitutions and a perturbative treatment of connected triple excitations [CCSD(T)] with the augmented correlation-consistent polarized valence triple-zeta aug-cc-pVTZ basis at 51 816 geometries provide a six-dimensional potential-energy surface for the electronic ground state of NH3. At 3814 selected geometries, CBS+ energies are obtained by extrapolating the CCSD(T) results for the aug-cc-pVXZ(X=T,Q,5) basis sets to the complete basis set (CBS) limit and adding corrections for core-valence correlation and relativistic effects. CBS** ab initio energies are generated at 51,816 geometries by an empirical extrapolation of the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ results to the CBS+ limit. They cover the energy region up to 20,000 cm-1 above equilibrium. Parametrized analytical functions are fitted through the ab initio points. For these analytical surfaces, vibrational term values and transition moments are calculated by means of a variational program employing a kinetic-energy operator expressed in the Eckart-Sayvetz frame. Comparisons against experiment are used to assess the quality of the generated potential-energy surfaces. A \"spectroscopic\" potential-energy surface of NH3 is determined by a slight empirical adjustment of the ab initio potential to the experimental vibrational term values. Variational calculations on this refined surface yield rms deviations from experiment of 0.8 cm-1 for 24 inversion splittings and 0.4 (3.0) cm-1 for 34 (51) vibrational term values up to 6100 (10,300) cm-1.",

On the basis of the computed nucleus independent chemical shifts (NICS) at the cage center and also at the center of individual rings as magnetic criteria, heterofullerenes with 60 \u03c0-electrons are as aromatic as the parent C60, while those with 66 \u03c0-electrons are much less aromatic than C60 6-. The very distinct endohedral chemical shifts of the 66 \u03c0-electron systems may be useful to identify the heterofullerenes through their endohedral 3He NMR chemical shifts.",

At the BP86/AE1 level, the electronic structure of the monocation is that of a delocalized mixed-valence species. At the B3LYP/AE1 level, the spin density of the unpaired electron is largely localized on one Mn atom, in accord with the formulation of a trapped-valence ground state (Atwood, C. G.; Geiger, W. E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000, 122, 5477).

        "abstract": "We present a new computational method with associated computer program TROVE (Theoretical ROVibrational Energies) to perform variational calculations of rovibrational energies for general polyatomic molecules of arbitrary structure in isolated electronic states. The (approximate) nuclear kinetic energy operator is represented as an expansion in terms of internal coordinates. The main feature of the computational scheme is a numerical construction of the kinetic energy operator, which is an integral part of the computation process. Thus the scheme is self-contained, i.e., it requires no analytical pre-derivation of the kinetic energy operator. It is also general, since it can be used in connection with any internal coordinates. The method represents an extension of our model for pyramidal XY 3 molecules reported previously [S.N. Yurchenko, M. Carvajal, P. Jensen, H. Lin, J.J. Zheng, W. Thiel, Mol. Phys. 103 (2005) 359].

        "title": "Towards efficient refinement of molecular potential energy surfaces: Ammonia as a case study",
        "abstract": "In order to approach experimental accuracy in ro-vibrational calculations for polyatomic molecules one needs to empirically refine even a high accuracy ab initio potential energy surface (PES). This is most efficiently done through a least-squares fitting of theoretical energies to the available experimental data by varying potential parameters in a given analytical representation. The PES resulting from such a fitting is then referred to as a \u2018spectroscopic\u2019 PES. In the present work we report a new approach to the construction of \u2018spectroscopic\u2019 PESs of polyatomic molecules. We represent the refinement as a perturbation to the initial PES, which is diagonalized in a basis of eigenfunctions of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. We apply this method to construct a new \u2018spectroscopic\u2019 PES for 14 NH 3 using literature values for observed spectroscopic data for J \u2a7d 8 and covering the energy range below 10 300 cm \u22121 . We impose the constraint that the resulting PES remain close to the ab initio surface. The new \u2018spectroscopic\u2019 PES of NH 3 (called NH3-Y2010) reproduces the selected experimental term values with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.2 cm \u22121 . Keywords Vibration\u2013rotation spectroscopy Ammonia Potential energy surface 1 Introduction It is generally accepted that the present level of ab initio theory is incapable of providing experimental accuracy in ro-vibrational calculations for most polyatomic molecules. It is therefore common to empirically refine an ab initio potential energy surface (PES) in a suitable analytical representation by least-squares fitting to available experimental spectroscopic data. In such refinements one minimizes a root-mean-square-type functional by iteratively solving (usually variationally) a set of ro-vibrational Schr\u00f6dinger equations. The refined PES is then referred to as a \u2018spectroscopic\u2019 PES. In the present work we propose a new approach to construct \u2018spectroscopic\u2019 potential energy surfaces of polyatomic molecules. The main feature of our approach, now implemented in the program suite TROVE [1] , is that the eigenfunctions of the initial problem are utilized as basis set in the refinements. We have already applied this approach to construct \u2018spectroscopic\u2019 PESs for 121 SbH 3 [2] and H 2 CO [3] . In the present work we utilize it to generate a new \u2018spectroscopic\u2019 PES for 14 NH 3 (henceforth referred to as ammonia or NH 3 ) through fittings to the available experimental energies with J \u2a7d 8 (mainly from the HITRAN data base [4] ). This new PES (referred to as NH3-Y2010) has been already used in the production of a new line list for NH 3 [5] which, in turn, has proved important for analysis of the spectra of very cool brown dwarfs [6] and extra-solar planets [7] . Recently a \u2018spectroscopic\u2019 PES of NH 3 was obtained by Huang et al. [8] through refinement of a high-level coupled cluster PES (with various corrections) against the most reliable J = 0 \u2212 2 transitions in the HITRAN 2004 database below 5300 cm \u22121 . These results [8] are in excellent agreement with experiment, with a root-mean-square (rms) error of 0.02 cm \u22121 for the transitions involving J \u2a7d 2 in 13 HITRAN 2004 bands. Subsequently, the same authors reported a new improved \u2018spectroscopic\u2019 PES of ammonia HSL-2 [9] which provides the same level of accuracy for a larger set of experimental energies having J \u2a7d 6. In the present work we use their results as a reference for our refinements. It should be noted that other \u2018spectroscopic\u2019 PESs of NH 3 available in the literature (e.g. from Refs. [10\u201312] ) are significantly less accurate. The paper is structured as follows. The new fitting approach is described in Section 2 and it is then employed for construction of \u2018spectroscopic\u2019 PESs of NH 3 in Section 3 . The experimental data set selected for the fittings is discussed in Section 4 . The results of the refinement are presented in Section 5 , and Section 6 offers some conclusions. 2 Description of the method and computational details To perform a refinement for a given PES, most conveniently represented by an analytically parameterized expression, one requires a computational method to obtain (ro-)vibrational energies as well as their derivatives with respect to the parameters to be refined. Assuming that the initial potential energy function V already provides a reasonable approximation for the \u2018true\u2019 PES of the molecule in question, we represent the effect of the refinement as an additive correction \u0394 V to V . We then expand \u0394 V in terms of the internal coordinates \u03be i : (1) \u0394 V = \u2211 ijk \u2026 \u0394 f ijk \u2026 \u03be 1 i \u03be 2 j \u03be 3 k \u2026 A , where { \u03be 1 i \u03be 2 j \u03be 3 k \u2026 } A corresponds to totally symmetric permutations of terms \u03be 1 i \u03be 2 j \u03be 3 k \u2026 with A as the totally symmetric representation of the molecular symmetry (MS) group (see, e.g., Ref. [13] ). The expansion coefficients \u0394 f ijk\u2026 in Eq. (1) are the parameters to be refined. The corresponding Hamiltonian is then given by: (2) H = T + V + \u0394 V = H 0 + \u2211 ijk \u2026 \u0394 f ijk \u2026 \u03be 1 i \u03be 2 j \u03be 3 k \u2026 A , where H 0 = T + V is the initial, \u2018unperturbed\u2019 Hamiltonian and T is the kinetic energy operator. Provided that the eigenvalue problem for the unperturbed Hamiltonian (3) H 0 \u03c8 0 , i J , \u0393 = E 0 , i J , \u0393 \u03c8 0 , i J , \u0393 , has been solved, the Hamiltonian H can be diagonalized in the representation of the eigenfunctions \u03c8 0 , i J , \u0393 . We will refer to this basis set as an H 0 basis set representation. The corresponding matrix elements are given by (4) \u3008 \u03c8 0 , i J , \u0393 \u2223 H \u2223 \u03c8 0 , i \u2032 J , \u0393 \u3009 = E 0 , i J , \u0393 + \u2211 ijk \u2026 \u0394 f ijk \u2026 \u039e i , i \u2032 J , \u0393 , where (5) \u039e i , i \u2032 J , \u0393 = \u3008 \u03c8 0 , i J , \u0393 \u2223 { \u03be 1 i \u03be 2 j \u03be 3 k \u2026 } A \u2223 \u03c8 0 , i \u2032 J , \u0393 \u3009 . Here J is the total angular momentum quantum number, \u0393 is the symmetry in the MS group [13] , and i is a running index used to distinguish eigenfunctions with the same values of J and \u0393 . Since each expansion term { \u03be 1 i \u03be 2 j \u03be 3 k \u2026 } A is totally symmetric in the MS group and also purely vibrational, the Hamiltonian matrix (4) is diagonal both in terms of J and \u0393 , which significantly simplifies the evaluation of the matrix elements in Eq. (4) . Besides, assuming that the \u2018perturbation\u2019 \u0394 V is small, the diagonalization of Eq. (4) can be carried out with a relatively small number of basis functions \u03c8 0 , i \u2032 J , \u0393 . The derivatives of the energies with respect to the adjustable parameters, which are required by efficient least-squares algorithms, are computed utilizing the Hellmann\u2013Feynman theorem [14] in conjunction with Eq. (2) : (6) \u2202 E n J , \u0393 \u2202 \u0394 f ijk \u2026 = \u03c8 n J , \u0393 \u2202 \u0394 V \u2202 \u0394 f ijk \u2026 \u03c8 n J , \u0393 = \u3008 \u03c8 n J , \u0393 | { \u03be 1 i \u03be 2 j \u03be 3 k \u2026 } A | \u03c8 n J , \u0393 \u3009 . where E n J , \u0393 and \u03c8 n J , \u0393 are the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of H , respectively, and n is the running index. In the H 0 -representation \u03c8 n J , \u0393 is given by the expansion (7) \u03c8 n J , \u0393 = \u2211 i C i J , \u0393 , n \u03c8 0 , i J , \u0393 . Taking into account Eq. (5) for the derivatives in Eq. (6) we obtain (8) \u2202 E n J \u0393 \u2202 \u0394 f ijk \u2026 = C n T \u039e J \u0393 C n , where the eigenvector C n contains the coefficients C n , i J , \u0393 , a superscript T denotes transposition, and \u039e J\u0393 collects the matrix elements \u039e i , i \u2032 J \u0393 . The vector-matrix-vector product in Eq. (8) is required only for the limited number of states associated with the input data set for the PES fitting. 3 Application to NH 3 In the present work we apply our refinement procedure to the construction of a \u2018spectroscopic\u2019 PES for NH 3 . To represent the PES of ammonia analytically, we employ the symmetry adapted expansion from Ref. [12] (9) V ( \u03be 1 , \u03be 2 , \u03be 3 , \u03be 4 , \u03be 5 , \u03be 6 ) = \u2211 ijklmn f ijklmn { \u03be 1 i \u03be 2 j \u03be 3 k \u03be 4 l \u03be 5 m \u03be 6 n } A , in terms of the variables (10) \u03be k = 1 - exp ( - a ( r k - r e ) ) , k = 1 , 2 , 3 , (11) \u03be 4 = 1 6 2 \u03b1 1 - \u03b1 2 - \u03b1 3 , (12) \u03be 5 = 1 2 ( \u03b1 2 - \u03b1 3 ) , (13) \u03be 6 = sin \u03c1 \u00af - sin \u03c1 e , and (14) sin \u03c1 \u00af = 2 3 sin [ ( \u03b1 1 + \u03b1 2 + \u03b1 3 ) / 6 ] , where r e denotes the equilibrium value of r k , sin \u03c1 e is the equilibrium value of sin \u03c1 \u00af , a is a molecular parameter, and the quantities f ijklmn in Eq. (9) are expansion coefficients. The maximum expansion orders in Eq. (9) are six for the non-rigid mode \u03be 6 and four for \u03be 1 , \u03be 2 , \u03be 3 , \u03be 4 , and \u03be 5 . In total there are 106 symmetrically unique potential parameters f ijklmn . Furthermore, we use the type of expansion given in Eq. (9) to represent also the \u2018perturbation\u2019 \u0394 V in Eq. (1) . That is, the refined potential parameters f ijk \u2026 \u2032 are given by (15) f ijklmn \u2032 = f ijklmn + \u0394 f ijklmn . The explicit form of the expansion in Eq. (9) is given in the Supplementary material as a Fortran 90 program (see also the Supplementary material to Ref. [12] ). This expansion has also been used to represent the PESs of PH 3 , NH 3 + , SbH 3 , and BiH 3 [15\u201318] . As the \u2018unperturbed\u2019 PES V we use the \u2018spectroscopic\u2019 PES of NH 3 from Ref. [12] . The latter was generated to reproduce the vibrational ( J = 0) band centers of NH 3 with an rms error of 0.4 (3.0) cm \u22121 up to 6100 (10 300) cm \u22121 [12] . Our goal here is to improve further this \u2018spectroscopic\u2019 PES. The initial values of the \u0394 f ijklmn in Eq. (15) are taken to be zero. In all our nuclear motion calculations the program suite TROVE [1] was employed. For the description of the method the reader is referred to Ref. [1] . Most of the technical details of TROVE calculations for NH 3 are the same as in Ref. [19] . The kinetic energy operator and of the potential energy function are expanded to 6th- and 8th-order, respectively. In TROVE the size of the basis set is controlled by the polyad number P which, in the case of ammonia, is defined as (16) P = 2 ( n 1 + n 2 + n 3 ) + n 4 + n 5 + n 6 2 , where n i denotes the quantum numbers associated with the basis functions \u03d5 n i (see Ref. [19] ). Thus, we include in the basis set only those functions \u03d5 n for which P \u2a7dP max . Presently P max is chosen to be 14. The Hamiltonian matrices for J = 0 \u2026 8 were constructed using the symmetry adapted ( J = 0)-contracted basis set [19] and diagonalized to obtain the eigenfunctions \u03c8 0 , i J , \u0393 . The latter then were used to generate the matrix elements \u039e i , i \u2032 J , \u0393 in accordance with Eq. (5) . This is the most cumbersome part of the calculations, which took about three months and required several hundred gigabytes of disk space. In order to prevent the refined PES from assuming unphysical shapes during the fittings, the refined PES was constrained to a reference PES. The reference PES was chosen to be the ab initio CBS \u2217\u2217 5 PES from Ref. [12] . As in our previous work, we simultaneously fit experimentally derived energy differences and ab initio energies (see Ref. [20] for details). The relative importance of these reference data is controlled by the weight factors W i exp and W i ai assigned to the experimental and ab initio data points, respectively. In this approach, the ratio R = W i exp / W i ai has to be optimized by letting it increase gradually from a small value (consistent with fitting the ab initio energies only) to a large value (giving dominant weight to the experimental data). Apart from helping to retain the physically correct shape of the PES during the refinement, this approach allows us to vary all potential energy parameters irrespective of the amount and structure of the experimental data. This circumvents problems with shortage of experimental data, which is a standard bottleneck for most fitting approaches to PES construction. 4 Experimental data selected for the refinement Huang et al. [21] recently gave a very detailed review of the present situation regarding the experimentally derived energies and transition wavenumbers of 14 NH 3 available in the literature. Here we discuss only issues related to our selection of the input data set for the PES fitting. Apart from HITRAN, which is our main source of spectroscopic data, we have gathered experimental ro-vibrational term values of NH 3 from Refs. [22\u201326] . It is generally accepted by now that proper PES refinements should employ not only purely vibrational ( J = 0) energy levels, but also ro-vibrational term values [27] . Our fitting set comprises 392 energies for J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and J = 8 (compared to 482 levels in the fitting set of Huang et al. [9] for J = 0 \u2212 6). In order to facilitate the calculation of the energies E n J , \u0393 and the corresponding derivatives from Eq. (6) for J = 3, 5, 8 we considered only the A 2 \u2032 and A 2 \u2033 symmetry blocks of the Hamiltonian matrix 4 , which are approximately two times smaller in size than the E \u2032 and E \u2033 symmetry blocks for the same value of J (the A 1 \u2032 and A 1 \u2033 ro-vibrational states of NH 3 do not exist because of the zero nuclear spin statistical weight factor). In doing so we assumed that the effects of the force constants \u0394 f ijk\u2026 on the molecular vibrations are equally distributed over all symmetry blocks for higher J so that it should be sufficient to utilize only the energies of the A 2 levels. 4.1 HITRAN data for 14 NH 3 HITRAN is a very useful compilation of the available experimental spectroscopic information on many molecules, including NH 3 . However the ammonia data in this database are far from being complete and highly accurate. In order to assemble a consistent input data set of experimental energies it is necessary to perform a thorough check of the ammonia data from HITRAN (see also the discussion by Huang et al. [8,21] ). The major source of errors in ammonia HITRAN is that the ammonia data have been collected from different experimental studies over the last 20 years. The accuracy of the transition wavenumbers in HITRAN (which originate from the ground and \u03bd 2 states) is high. For NH 3 these wavenumbers are documented in HITRAN08 with at least eight significant digits. However in many cases, this accuracy is not reflected by the quality of the corresponding derived energy levels. The experimental analyses behind these data are based on different effective Hamiltonians and also on different sets of lower state energies of very different quality. Many lower state energies, especially for the transitions above 5000 cm \u22121 are given with 5\u20136 significant digits, i.e., these energies are several orders of magnitude less accurate than the wavenumbers they were derived from. The upper state energies will then inherit these large errors. In addition, the inaccuracy of the lower state energies may affect the assignment of the corresponding transitions (see also Ref. [21] where a number of mis-assigned transitions in the ammonia HITRAN data were reported). Accurate upper state energies, especially for vibrationally excited levels, and reliable assignments are prerequisites for compiling a useful input data set for the PES fitting. Because of the ambiguities in the definition of the lower and upper state energies, it is usually recommended to fit the transition wavenumbers rather than the derived energies. Transition wavenumbers are always of higher accuracy. However using energies in empirical refinements is less demanding in terms of computer resources. Therefore we decided in favor of the energies, but only after improving the quality of the corresponding HITRAN data for NH 3 as follows. All lower state energies in the ammonia HITRAN data were corrected by substituting them with the most recent experimental data from Chen et al. [28] who obtained the ground and \u03bd 2 state term values of 14 NH 3 for J \u2a7d 20 with very high accuracy from a simultaneous analysis of microwave, terahertz, and infrared transitions. Subsequently, the corresponding upper state energies of NH 3 could be determined with near-experimental accuracy. This procedure also helped us to locate many obvious outliers among the HITRAN transitions of NH 3 , which need to be either removed or re-analysed. Once the HITRAN lower state energies had been replaced by the accurate values from Ref. [28] , we could use the combination differences (CD) between the HITRAN transitions to select a reliable set of experimental levels for our fits. In doing so we preferred to take only levels involved in at least two transitions, for which the differences between the upper state energes obtained do not exceed 0.001 cm \u22121 . Energies derived without the use of CDs were assigned reduced weights in the fittings. Such poorly defined energy levels are involved in few transitions only; they are predominantly found for low J . For J > 2 there is generally no shortage of CDs. In the experimental work of Cottaz et al. [22] (which, for the most part, is included in HITRAN) a number of transitions were tentatively assigned as belonging to the 4 \u03bd 2 \u2212 \u03bd 2 hot band. We have included in the data set for the PES fitting six seemingly reliable 4 \u03bd 2 energies determined from transitions not included in HITRAN. 4.2 The 1.5 \u03bcm region The interest in the spectral region around the 1.5 \u03bcm band system is motivated by the development of monochromatic diode lasers operating near this wavelength. The ammonia spectrum in this region (between 6400 and 6900 cm \u22121 ) was targeted in a number of experimental studies, some of which provided a set of high-resolution absorption lines without any ro-vibrational analysis [29\u201333] , while others recorded the complete spectral structure and made an attempt of assigning it [24\u201326,32,34,35] . However, owing to a very complex structure in this region with many vibrational bands, only a limited number of lines have been analysed so far. Because of the uncertainty in the assignment of these data it was of special importance to select for our fittings only levels determined from at least two transition wavenumbers. Berden et al. [24] reported 27 assigned transitions and 24 unique term values for J \u2a7d 2, with 18 verified by CDs. This set of levels from the region around 1.5 \u03bcm was later extensively complemented in high-resolution studies by Xu and co-workers [25,26] . With the help of their algorithm VISTA based on the vibrational isotopic shifts, they were able to identify a large number of energy levels for J \u2a7d 10 giving rise to several of the strongest vibrational bands. From these various references, we included 37 selected energy values in our J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 input data set for the PES fitting. 4.3 Vibrational ( J = 0) band centers About 50 vibrational term values of NH 3 below 10 300 cm \u22121 are known in the literature (see, for example, the term values collected in Ref. [12] ). Generally the vibrational band centers are known less accurately than the ro-vibrational term values. The former are obtained by fitting of the spectroscopic constants in the corresponding effective Hamiltonian and are thus to some extent model dependent, while the latter are derived directly from the observed experimental wavenumbers and should thus reflect the experimental accuracy. Therefore we assigned smaller weight factors to the vibrational band centers. Some of the vibrational term values were even completely excluded from the fit as well as from the statistics, for example the term values 6520, 6795.30, and 6796.7 cm \u22121 [23] , because their inclusion spoiled our fit. Our suspicion is that at least one of these band origins is incorrect. 4.4 Energies above 10 000 cm \u22121 Coy and Lehmann reported a set of vibrational band centers of ammonia between 4900 cm \u22121 and 18 200 cm \u22121 obtained from the analysis of the microwave optical double resonance spectrum [23] . In total we selected 10 levels from this work, including four levels between 10 000 and 10 300 cm \u22121 which were assigned smaller weights. Although the resolution of these latter data, represented by stretching excitations, is not very high, and the analysis is not very certain, these data are very valuable for our refinement. Including them allows us to sample better the higher-energy parts of the PES, which is important for improving the predictive power of the generated \u2018spectroscopic\u2019 PES in this region. 5 Results and discussion The complete input data set for the fitting is given in the Supplementary material together with the corresponding theoretical ro-vibrational term values obtained with our new \u2018spectroscopic\u2019 PES. In Table 1 we show an extract from this list for J = 5. In Tables 2 and 3 we compare our purely vibrational ( J = 0) term values computed using NH3-Y2010 and TROVE with the theoretical term values reported by Huang et al. [9,21] , and with theoretical term values obtained in GENIUSH [36] calculations [37] based on NH3-Y2010 (see below). Our final potential NH3-Y2010 reproduces the 392 experimental term values for J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 from our fitting set (see below) with an rms error of 0.20 cm \u22121 . The 33 (43) vibrational band centers below 6100 (10 300) cm \u22121 are reproduced with an rms error of 0.12 (0.30) cm \u22121 . The latter can be compared to the rms error of 0.16 (1.10) cm \u22121 for the corresponding J = 0 HSL-2 energies from Tables 2 and 3 . The HSL-2 energies are more accurate in the lower energy range (with an rms error of about 0.02 cm \u22121 [9] ), whereas our band centers exhibit smaller deviations from the experimentally derived term values above 6500 cm \u22121 . The refined parameters f ijk \u2026 \u2032 are given in the Supplementary material . Our PES NH3-Y2010 has the following stationary points: the global minimum is at a bond length of r e = 1.0109285 \u00c5 and a bond angle of \u03b1 e = 106.7468\u00b0; the planar saddle point (SP) is at r SP = 0.9943827 \u00c5; it corresponds to a barrier height of \u0394 E = 1766.83 cm \u22121 . The corresponding parameters of the \u2018spectroscopic\u2019 PES HSL-2 [9] are r e = 1.0106676 \u00c5, \u03b1 e = 106.7489\u00b0; r SP = 0.9942537 \u00c5; \u0394 E = 1784.66 cm \u22121 . We obtain structural parameter values very close to those of HSL-2 whereas the height of the barrier to planarity obtained in the present work is 18 cm \u22121 lower than that of HSL-2. The best ab initio value is 1786.8 cm \u22121 [38] . A visualization of the agreement with experiment achieved in the fitting of the NH3-Y2010 PES is presented in Fig. 1 , where the absolute values of residuals (\u2223Obs.\u2013Calc.\u2223) are plotted for all fitted term values. Our rms value is larger than that attained by Huang et al. [9] in fitting HSL-2, that is 0.02 cm \u22121 for J \u2a7d 6 transitions in band systems with origins below 6000 cm \u22121 . According to Ref. [9] , one of the reasons for the better performance of HSL-2 is the inclusion of non-adiabatic corrections which we neglect. Besides, the variational approach of Refs. [9,21] is based on an exact kinetic energy (KE) operator, while TROVE utilizes a Taylor-like expansion of the KE operator; the approximation inherent in the expansion can be considered as another source of error. Finally, the chosen input data sets and weighting schemes are different. Most importantly, we employ vibrationally excited term values also above 6000 cm \u22121 . Huang et al. exclude these data points but have a more detailed coverage of the lower energy region. The truncations of the kinetic and potential energy operators in conjunction with the basis set truncation at P max = 14 (see above) will affect the accuracy of the \u2018spectroscopic\u2019 PES determined. Therefore our refined PES NH3-Y2010 is \u2018effective\u2019. The stated accuracy of 0.20 cm \u22121 can only be reached when NH3-Y2010 is used in the TROVE calculations described in the present work. In order to investigate the effects of the approximations made in the TROVE KE operator we compare the results of the present work with calculations based on NH3-Y2010 and made by means of the alternative approach GENIUSH [36] to solving the vibrational Schr\u00f6dinger equation; GENIUSH employs an exact KE operator. The GENIUSH calculations were kindly carried out by Professor Attila Cs\u00e1sz\u00e1r and Dr. Csaba F\u00e1bri [37] . When compared with the experimentally derived values, the vibrational term values computed with NH3-Y2010 and GENIUSH exhibit an rms error of 0.9 cm \u22121 for all 73 J = 0 states below 6300 cm \u22121 and only 0.1 cm \u22121 for the 33 J = 0 term values included in the input data set for the PES fitting of the present work. The largest error of about 4 cm \u22121 is found for the term value of the \u03bd 2 + 3 \u03bd 4 state. This data point was not included in the input data set for the NH3-Y2010 fitting; the experimentally derived vibrational term value does not exist. The GENIUSH results are converged to better than 0.01 cm \u22121 . In principle, we could improve further the accuracy of our fitted PES by increasing the value of P max and the orders of the polynomial expansions of the kinetic and potential energy operators used in the fits. However, we have chosen P max = 14, in conjunction with 6th- and 8th-order expansions of the KE operator and V , respectively, in order to speed up significantly the calculations and make them feasible. 6 Conclusions In the present work we have proposed a new approach to empirical potential energy surface refinement. The method is based on a so-called H 0 -contraction of the ro-vibrational basis functions. In this approach, the eigenfunctions corresponding to the initial PES are used as basis sets in consecutive fittings. This leads to a significant reduction of the computational effort. For example, in the case of J = 5 and \u0393 = A 2 \u2032 ( A 2 \u2033 ) , about 6 000 basis functions \u03c8 0 , n J , \u03b3 are sufficient for the refinement in the H 0 -representation, but we need to use about twice as many to solve Eq. (3) . Besides, calculation of the matrix elements \u3008 \u03c8 0 , i J , \u0393 \u2223 H \u2223 \u03c8 0 , i \u2032 J , \u0393 \u3009 , required at each iteration, is significantly simplified in this representation according with Eq. (4) . This is very critical for least-squares fittings, in which many iterations are required until convergence. To be more specific, the standard fitting cycle (about ten iterations) in the H 0 representation for J = 0 \u2026 8 takes several days only on the computers available to us despite the relatively high J values of the states involved. This should be compared with the several weeks required to solve once the H 0 eigenvalue problem defined by Eq. (3) . It should be noted that the approach of the present work is suited only for potential energy functions linear in terms of the parameters to be refined (see Eq. (1) ). Therefore we cannot fit directly the equilibrium constants of NH 3 . This is no real problem, however, since these parameters can be corrected by refining the linear potential parameters f i in the expansion of the PES (see Eq. (1) ). Nor can we utilize in our present refinement the non-adiabatic treatment employed by Huang et al., which has been considered important in obtaining highly accurate PES fits for NH 3 [9] . We are planning to extend our fitting approach to allow also for such non-adiabatic corrections. However, we note that Watson [39] showed that for diatomic molecules such corrections cannot be unambiguously determined by fitting to energy levels alone. This finding is consistent with attempts to include non-adiabatic corrections in fits of spectroscopic potential energy surfaces for water [40,41] . This situation is likely to persist for ammonia. Finally we note that in the course of the present work we identified a number of problems with the ammonia data given in the current edition of HITRAN [4] . A comprehensive re-analysis of the ammonia spectra included in HITRAN will be presented in a future paper [42] .

We show that at high J the calculated energy levels of the di-deuterated species XHD 2 exhibit distinct fourfold cluster patterns highly similar to those observed for H 2 X molecules. We conclude from eigenfunction analysis that in the energy cluster states, the XHD 2 molecule rotates about a so-called localization axis which is approximately parallel to one of the X\u2013D bonds.

By means of variational calculations of the rotation\u2013vibration energies based on ab initio potential energy surfaces, we analyze the rotational energy clustering of BiH 3 and SbH 3 at J \u2a7d 70 for a number of vibrational states. We show that BiH 3 and SbH 3 , with their pronounced local mode behaviour, exhibit cluster formation already at moderate rotational excitation. In addition, owing to its quasi-spherical-top character, BiH 3 undergoes an imperfect bifurcation at high J . This gives rise to an energy cluster type not present in PH 3 and SbH 3 . We present a semi-classical approach to the construction of the rotational energy surfaces for vibrationally excited states.

The calculations utilize new high-level textit{ab initio} potential energy and dipole moment surfaces. Along with the mass dependence, frequency data and Einstein A coefficients are computed for all transitions probed. Particular attention is paid to the $Delta|k|=3$ and $Delta|k-l|=3$ transitions comprising the accidentally coinciding $|J,K!=!0,v_2!=!0^+rangle$ and $|J,K!=!3,v_2!=!0^-rangle$ rotation-inversion energy levels. The newly computed probes exhibit sensitivities comparable to their ammonia and methanol counterparts, thus demonstrating their potential for testing the cosmological stability of the proton-to-electron mass ratio. The theoretical TROVE results are in close agreement with sensitivities obtained using the nonrigid and rigid inverter approximate models, confirming that the textit{ab initio} theory used in the present study is adequate.",

Transitions between these two states possess significantly enhanced sensitivity to a possible variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio $mu$. Using a robust variational approach to determine the mass sensitivity of the energy levels along with accurate experimental values for the energies, sensitivity coefficients have been calculated for over 350 microwave, submillimetre and far infrared transitions up to $J!=!15$ for $^{14}$NH$_3$. The sensitivities are the largest found in ammonia to date. One particular transition, although extremely weak, has a sensitivity of $T=-16,738$ and illustrates the huge enhancement that can occur between close-lying energy levels. More promising however are a set of previously measured transitions with $T=-32$ to $28$. Given the astrophysical importance of ammonia, the sensitivities presented here confirm that $^{14}$NH$_3$ can be used exclusively to constrain a spatial or temporal variation of $mu$. Thus, certain systematic errors which affect the ammonia method can be eliminated. For all transitions analyzed we provide frequency data and Einstein A coefficients to guide future laboratory and astronomical observations.",

Variational calculations of the infrared spectrum of CH 3 Cl show good agreement with a range of experimental results. This includes vibrational transition moments, absolute line intensities of the  \u03bd  1 ,  \u03bd  4 ,  \u03bd  5  and 3 \u03bd  6  bands, and a rotation\u2013vibration line list for both CH 3  35 Cl and CH 3  37 Cl including states up to  J =85 and vibrational band origins up to 4400\u00a0cm \u22121 . Across the spectrum band shape and structure are well reproduced and computed absolute line intensities are comparable with highly accurate experimental measurements for certain fundamental bands.

        "abstract": "The small fullerenes, C 36 n (n=0,2+,2\u2212) and their heteroanalogues (C 30 N 6 , C 30 B 6 , C 24 N 12 and C 24 B 12 ) have been investigated at the density functional B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. The aromaticity of these systems was characterized systematically by using the computed nucleus independent chemical shifts values at the cage center and also at the center of individual rings. The hydrogenation product, C 36 H 36 , may be experimentally observable considering the calculated strain energy. 1 Introduction The proposed synthesis of the fullerene C 36 by Zettl [1] in 1998 has attracted considerable attention, since fullerenes smaller than C 60 are considered to be highly strained due to the presence of fused five-membered rings. The pronounced strain energy will give rise to high reactivity, low stability, and will make the determination and characterization difficult. The synthesis, purification and identification of C 36 H 6 and C 36 H 6 O has been reported by Koshio et al. [2] . However, the question remained open whether these compounds are fullerenes or not. In addition to these experimental investigations, a series of theoretical papers on the structures and energies [3\u20137] , the unique bonding properties [8\u201310] , and vibrational frequencies of the neutral and the charged C 36 species [11] have been published. Both ab initio and DFT calculations [7] show that the most stable isomer of C 36 has D 6h symmetry with a triplet ground state. In this Letter, systematic calculations on the structures and electronic prop erties of both neutral and charged C 36 species with D 6h symmetry, their hydrogenation products and their B- and N-doped analogues are presented. In addition, the degree of electron delocalization is evaluated by using the computed nucleus independent chemical shifts (NICS) [12] at the cage center and the individual ring centers of interest. NICS has been demonstrated to be a useful criterion for aromaticity or anti-aromaticity of a molecule [12,13] . The NICS at the cage center has essentially the same value as the 3 He endohedral shift which is a valuable experimental tool for characterizing fullerenes and their derivatives [14,15] . 2 Computational details Geometries were fully optimized in the given symmetry at the density-functional B3LYP/6-31G* level, and frequency analyses were performed at the HF/3-21G level on optimized HF/3-21G structures using Gaussian 98 [16] . The NICS values of the individual ring centers were computed at the GIAO-SCF/6-31G* level with the B3LYP/6-31G* geometries. This approach is well established for closed-shell singlets, and has also been applied and justified for open-shell triplets [17] . The calculated zero-point energies (ZPE) and total electronic energies are summarized in Table 1 . 3 Results and discussion The D 6h triplet ground state ( 1 ) and the corresponding D 6h singlet state ( 2 ) are the two most stable structures in C 36 [7] . Due to the high symmetry, they have only four independent bond lengths. As shown in Fig. 1 , there are no significant geometrical differences between 1 and 2 . As noted by Tanaka et al. [18] , only little changes are observed on going from C 36 to the dianion C 36 2\u2212 ( 3 ), and we find the same to hold also for the dication C 36 2+ ( 4 ). Hence, there is a close structural similarity between neutral and charged species. The electronic changes of the C 36 cages upon oxidation and reduction can be studied efficiently by using the NICS values. Indeed, Tanaka et al. [18] assigned the local aromaticity of the individual rings of the C 36 , C 36 \u00a0 \ue626 \u2212 and C 36 2\u2212 cages on this basis. They found that both the six- and five-membered rings are aromatic in 1 and 2 , the former being less aromatic than the latter. This is confirmed by our computed NICS values at the cage centers, i.e., \u221227.1 for 1 and \u221238.2 ppm for 2 , and they are even more aromatic than C 60 which has aromatic six-membered-rings and anti-aromatic five-membered rings and therefore is weak aromatic. According to this magnetic criterion, the more stable triplet state is less aromatic than the singlet state. It should be kept in mind, however, that both states are energetically close (triplet favored by 3.7 kcal/mol at B3LYP/6-31G* level) and that their energetic order has not yet been firmly established. Tanaka et al. [18] also found that 3 exhibits reduced aromaticity within the six-membered rings, while the five-membered rings become anti-aromatic ( Fig. 1 ). This is consistent with the calculated NICS (\u22128.1 ppm) value at the cage center, which is lower than that of C 36 . Compared to 2 , the dication 4 also has reduced aromatic character with a calculated NICS value of \u221228.3 at the cage center. In contrast to 3 , both the five- and six-membered rings in 4 are aromatic. It is interesting to note that all NICS values for 4 are comparable to those of 1 . Moreover, the six-membered rings (NICS=\u221221.5) along the sixfold axis in 1 , 2 and 4 are even more aromatic than benzene (NICS=\u221211.5) itself at the same level, while the NICS value for parallel six-membered ring are comparable to the benzene value [12] . Inspired by the work of Koshio et al. [2] , we have also computed some of the hydrogenation products, C 36 H 6 ( 5 , 6 ), C 36 H 12 ( 7 , 8 ) and C 36 H 36 ( 9 ) for the evaluation of the experimental work. The optimized bond lengths and computed NICS values for the cage center and individual rings are shown in Fig. 2 . For C 36 H 6 , two products were considered, one of them originates from the hydrogenation of the six-membered ring around the sixfold axis ( 5 ,C 6v ) and the other from that of the three six-membered rings forming a 1,4-cyclohexadiene substructures parallel to the sixfold axis ( 6 , D 3h ). The latter one is 29.8 kcal/mol more stable than the former, and therefore hydrogenation of the three inner double bonds is energetically more favorable. We have also investigated two C 36 H 12 species as possible further hydrogenation products in similar way. The first isomer ( 7 ,D 6h ) with two hydrogenated six-membered rings at the both ends contains a closed hexacene belt in which all the p-orbitals point towards the cage center. The second isomer ( 8 , D 6h ) has six 1,4-cyclohexadiene moieties and six parallel double bonds as well as two benzene ring at both ends. These two C 36 H 12 isomers have nearly the same energy, within 0.2 kcal/mol. In addition, we investigated the hydrogenation product, C 36 H 36 ( 9 ), which should be highly strained with its planar six- and five-membered rings, and the eclipsed C\u2013H bonds resulting angle and torsion strain. The strain energy of C 36 H 36 ( 9 , D 6 h ) has been estimated from the following reaction using ethane and iso-butane as references: (1) C 36 H 36 ( 9 )+54 C 2 H 6 =36 HC ( CH 3 ) 3 . At B3LYP/6-31G* + ZPE (HF/3-21G), the computed strain energy for 9 is 170.3 kcal/mol. The contribution of each >CH\u2013 unit is only 4.7 kcal/mol, much less than in the case of cubane (17.3 kcal/mol)using the same approach as for C 36 H 36 and 19.3 kcal/mol according to Wiberg [19] . Therefore, from a thermodynamic perspective it should be possible to detect C 36 H 36 experimentally. Fig. 2 also shows the NICS values for the hydrogenation products 5 \u2013 8 . The values at the center of the cage cover a wide range, between \u22127.8 ( 8 ) and \u221244.2 ( 7 ) ppm. It should thus be possible to distinguish these isomers on the basis of the corresponding 3 He endohedral shifts. On the other hand, C 36 H 36 ( 9 ) behaves like a normal saturated hydrocarbon, as expected, with C\u2013C bond lengths of 1.555\u20131.561 \u00c5 and a NICS value at the cage center of 2 ppm, comparable to the value (\u22121.1 ppm) for adamantane [12] . The successful syntheses of heterofullerenes opened up the possibility of the fine tuning of the electronic properties of the cage structures. Thus, in addition to the isocyclic C 36 systems, we have computed some selected nitrogen and boron doped derivatives, i.e., C 30 X 6 ( 10 , 11 ) and C 24 X 12 ( 12 , 13 ) . The C 30 X 6 systems are D 3h symmetric, while C 24 X 12 retains the D 6h symmetry. The calculated bond lengths and NICS values are shown in Fig. 3 . Compared with the carbon systems, the substitution by nitrogen results in large changes of the structural parameters and therefore also the degree of electron delocalization of the cage. With an increased number of nitrogen atoms, the C\u2013C bond length s become localized. For example, the parallel C\u2013C bonds, 1.443 \u00c5 in 2 , are shorter in 10 (1.390 \u00c5) and in 12 (1.334 \u00c5), as found by Grossman et al. [3] . This localization is reflected by the change of the computed NICS values at the cage center, which are \u221238.2 in 2 , and \u221218.5 in 10 , and only \u22124.3 in 12 . The same trend is seen for both the five- and six-membered rings. Similar geometric changes are found for boron incorporation, but the changes of the computed NICS values are dramatic, especially for the six-membered rings around the C 3 axis in 11 in which the corresponding NICS is only \u22121.2! In addition, the NICS value for the cage center of 13 is the largest found among those compounds, and all rings in 13 have larger NICS values than benzene. 4 Conclusion The density functional B3LYP/6-31G* method was employed to compute the fullerenes C 36 n (n=0,2+,2\u2212) , the heteroanalogues (C 30 N 6 , C 30 B 6 , C 24 N 12 and C 24 B 12 ) and some hydrogenation products. The NICS values at the center of the cages and the five- and six-membered rings were calculated to assess the global and local aromaticity of these systems. According to NICS, the less stable singlet C 36 is more aromatic than the more stable triplet state, while reduction (C 36 2\u2212 ) and oxidation (C 36 2+ ) result in lower aromaticity relative to the neutral singlet state. Incorporation of both nitrogen and boron leads to large geometric changes. While C 24 N 12 ( 12 , D 6 h ) with 48 \u03c0-electrons contains localized substructures and NICS value of \u22124.3 at cage center, C 24 B 12 ( 13 , D 6 h ) with 24 \u03c0-electrons has a highly delocalized substructure and the most negative NICS value (\u221244.6) at the cage center. The hydrogenation product, C 36 H 36 , might be accessible on the basis of the calculated strain energy since the strain contribution of each >CH\u2212 unit (4.7 kcal/mol) is rather small.

Qualitative trends in ab initio nucleus-independent chemical shifts at the cage centers are captured by the semiempirical GIAO-MNDO approach while underestimating their absolute values. The agreement between the semiempirical results and the ab initio or density functional reference data is generally better for the larger fullerenes (C 60 \u2013C 102 ) than for the smaller ones (C 20 \u2013C 50 ).

The degree of spherical electron delocalization is evaluated by using the computed nucleus-independent\n chemical shifts ( NICS) at the cage center and the individual ring centers of interest. The calculated NMR chemical shifts\n and the NICS values at the cage center, which can be accessed by endohedral 3He chemical shifts, should provide a basis for further experimental characterization of these compounds.",

        "abstract": "We report a six-dimensional CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ dipole moment surface for the electronic ground state of PH 3 computed ab initio on a large grid of 10 080 molecular geometries. Parameterized, analytical functions are fitted through the ab initio data, and the resulting dipole moment functions are used, together with a potential energy function determined by refining an existing ab initio surface in fittings to experimental wavenumber data, for simulating absorption spectra of the first three polyads of PH 3 , i.e., ( \u03bd 2 , \u03bd 4 ), ( \u03bd 1 , \u03bd 3 , 2 \u03bd 2 , 2 \u03bd 4 , \u03bd 2 + \u03bd 4 ), and ( \u03bd 1 + \u03bd 2 , \u03bd 3 + \u03bd 2 , \u03bd 1 + \u03bd 4 , \u03bd 3 + \u03bd 4 , 2 \u03bd 2 + \u03bd 4 , \u03bd 2 + 2 \u03bd 4 , 3 \u03bd 2 , 3 \u03bd 4 ). The resulting theoretical transition moments show excellent agreement with experiment. A line-by-line comparison of the simulated intensities of the \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 band system with 955 experimental intensity values reported by Brown et al. [L.R. Brown, R.L. Sams, I. Kleiner, C. Cottaz, L. Sagui, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 215 (2002) 178\u2013203] gives an average absolute percentage deviation of 8.7% (and a root-mean-square deviation of 0.94 cm \u22121 for the transition wavenumbers). This is very remarkable since the calculations rely entirely on ab initio dipole moment surfaces and do not involve any adjustment of these surfaces to reproduce the experimental intensities. Finally, we predict the line strengths for transitions between so-called cluster levels (near-degenerate levels formed at high rotational excitation) for J up to 60. Keywords Phosphine PH 3 Ab initio dipole moment surfaces Rovibrational intensities Energy clusters 1 Introduction We have recently reported variational calculations of the energies and wavefunctions for highly excited rotational states in the vibrational ground state of phosphine PH 3 [1] . These calculations were based on a potential energy surface for the electronic ground state of PH 3 obtained [2] by refining an existing ab initio surface [3] in a simultaneous fitting to ab initio data and experimentally derived vibrational energy spacings. At high rotational excitation, the energies form six-fold clusters [1] analogous to the well-known four-fold clusters formed in highly excited rotational states of several triatomic dihydrides H 2 X [4,5] . In the present work, we extend the work on PH 3 by computing transition moments of vibrational bands and intensities of individual rotation\u2013vibration transitions. These new calculations are based on a potential energy surface that is a further refinement of that reported in Ref. [2] , and on a dipole moment surface (DMS) for the electronic ground state of PH 3 that has been calculated ab initio at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. The nuclear-motion calculations of the present work are made by means of our recently developed variational model for the rotation and vibration of an XY 3 molecule [6\u20139] . The model is based on the Hougen\u2013Bunker\u2013Johns approach [5,10] . We have already applied it to simulate the absorption spectra for selected vibrational bands of NH 3 in its ground electronic state [8,9] , employing an ab initio DMS calculated at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory [9] . The theoretical intensity values for NH 3 [8,9] were found to agree very well with the corresponding experimental results. This has encouraged us to perform analogous calculations for PH 3 which we report here. For a detailed description of our model to calculate rotation\u2013vibration energies and intensities for XY 3 molecules, the reader is referred to Refs. [7] and [8] . He et al. [11] have previously computed a partial dipole moment surface for the electronic ground state of PH 3 by density functional theory (DFT); the level of theory was B3LYP/6-311++G(3df, 2pd) [12\u201314] . They considered the dependence of the dipole moment on the internuclear distances in PH 3 only, ignoring the bending motion. The partial DMS was found to produce satisfactory vibrational transition moments for most of the stretching bands whose intensities had been experimentally observed [11] . We validate our newly calculated DMS by comparing the vibrational transition moments and intensities from the present work with the available experimental data. We also compare our transition moments with results of the DFT study by He et al. [11] . The paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we describe the ab initio calculation of the dipole moment surface and the analytical representation of this surface. Section 3 discusses, in a similar manner, the potential energy surface of PH 3 employed in the present work. In Section 4 we give some details of the intensity calculations whose results are reported in the following sections. Section 5 presents the vibrational transition moment values computed with the new ab initio DMS; these are compared to the experimental and theoretical values available in the literature. In this section we also present theoretical simulations of the absorption spectra for a number of bands and line strength calculations for transitions between the cluster states mentioned above. Section 6 offers conclusions. 2 The molecular dipole moment The ab initio dipole moment values employed in the present work were computed with the MOLPRO2002 [15,16] package of ab initio programs; the calculations were done at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory (i.e., coupled cluster theory with all single and double substitutions [17] and a perturbative treatment of connected triple excitations [18,19] with the augmented correlation-consistent triple-zeta basis [20,21] ) in the frozen-core approximation. Throughout the paper this level of theory will be referred to as ATZfc. Dipole moments were computed using the central finite difference scheme with an added external dipole field of 0.005 a.u. Six calculations were made for each geometry. The convergence thresholds were 10 \u221210 for density and 10 \u221210 a.u. for energy in Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations, and 10 \u221210 a.u. for energy and 10 \u221210 for coefficients in CCSD computations. In the ab initio calculations we used a six-dimensional grid consisting of 10 080 unique geometries that form a regular grid in the range 1.25 \u00c5 \u2a7d r 1 \u2a7d r 2 \u2a7d r 3 \u2a7d 1.60 \u00c5 and 70\u00b0 \u2a7d \u03b1 1 , \u03b1 2 , \u03b1 3 \u2a7d 110\u00b0. Here, r i is the instantaneous value of the distance between P and H i , where H i is the proton labeled i (= 1, 2, or 3); \u03b1 i denotes the bond angle \u2220(H j PH k ) where ( i , j , k ) is a permutation of the numbers (1, 2, 3). We utilize the so-called Molecular-Bond (MB) representation [8,9,11,22] to describe the r i - and \u03b1 j -dependence of the electronically averaged dipole moment vector [5,8] \u03bc \u00af for PH 3 . In the MB representation it is given by (1) \u03bc \u00af = \u03bc \u00af 1 Bond e 1 + \u03bc \u00af 2 Bond e 2 + \u03bc \u00af 3 Bond e 3 where the three functions \u03bc \u00af i Bond , i = 1, 2, 3, depend on the vibrational coordinates, and e i is the unit vector along the P\u2013H i bond, (2) e i = r i - r 4 | r i - r 4 | with r i ( i = 1, 2, 3) as the position vector of proton i and r 4 as the position vector of the phosphorus nucleus. The representation of \u03bc \u00af in Eq. (1) is \u2018body-fixed\u2019 in the sense that it relates the dipole moment vector directly to the instantaneous positions of the nuclei (i.e., to the vectors r i ) [8] . Following Refs. [8,9] , we express the three functions \u03bc \u00af i Bond , i = 1, 2, 3, as (3) \u03bc \u00af i Bond = \u2211 j = 1 3 ( A - 1 ) ij ( \u03bc \u00af \u00b7 e j ) where ( A \u22121 ) ij is an element of the non-orthogonal 3 \u00d7 3 matrix A \u22121 obtained as the inverse 1 When the molecule is planar, the determinant \u2223 A \u2223 = 0 and A cannot be inverted. In this case we set \u03bc \u00af 3 Bond = 0 in Eq. (1) and express \u03bc \u00af in terms of e 1 and e 2 only, i.e., we determine \u03bc \u00af 1 Bond and \u03bc \u00af 2 Bond in terms of \u03bc \u00af \u00b7 e 1 and \u03bc \u00af \u00b7 e 2 . 1 of (4) A = 1 cos \u03b1 3 cos \u03b1 2 cos \u03b1 3 1 cos \u03b1 1 cos \u03b1 2 cos \u03b1 1 1 . For symmetry reasons, all three projections can be expressed in terms of a single function \u03bc \u00af 0 ( r 1 , r 2 , r 3 , \u03b1 1 , \u03b1 2 , \u03b1 3 ) [8] : (5) \u03bc \u00af \u00b7 e 1 = \u03bc \u00af 0 ( r 1 , r 2 , r 3 , \u03b1 1 , \u03b1 2 , \u03b1 3 ) = \u03bc \u00af 0 ( r 1 , r 3 , r 2 , \u03b1 1 , \u03b1 3 , \u03b1 2 ) , (6) \u03bc \u00af \u00b7 e 2 = \u03bc \u00af 0 ( r 2 , r 3 , r 1 , \u03b1 2 , \u03b1 3 , \u03b1 1 ) = \u03bc \u00af 0 ( r 2 , r 1 , r 3 , \u03b1 2 , \u03b1 1 , \u03b1 3 ) , (7) \u03bc \u00af \u00b7 e 3 = \u03bc \u00af 0 ( r 3 , r 1 , r 2 , \u03b1 3 , \u03b1 1 , \u03b1 2 ) = \u03bc \u00af 0 ( r 3 , r 2 , r 1 , \u03b1 3 , \u03b1 2 , \u03b1 1 ) , and this function is chosen as an expansion (8) \u03bc \u00af 0 = \u03bc 0 ( 0 ) + \u2211 k \u03bc k ( 0 ) \u03be k + \u2211 k , l \u03bc kl ( 0 ) \u03be k \u03be l + \u2211 k , l , m \u03bc klm ( 0 ) \u03be k \u03be l \u03be m + \u2211 k , l , m , n \u03bc klmn ( 0 ) \u03be k \u03be l \u03be m \u03be n + \u2026 in the variables (9) \u03be k = ( r k - r e ) exp ( - \u03b2 2 ( r k - r e ) 2 ) , k = 1 , 2 , 3 , (10) \u03be l = cos ( \u03b1 l - 3 ) - cos ( \u03b1 e ) , l = 4 , 5 , 6 , where r e and \u03b1 e are the equilibrium values of the bond lengths and bond angles, respectively. We include the factor exp (\u2212 \u03b2 2 ( r k \u2212 r e ) 2 ) in Eq. (8) in order to keep the expansion from diverging at large r k [9,22] . The expansion coefficients \u03bc k , l , m , \u2026 ( 0 ) in Eq. (8) are pairwise equal. We have (11) \u03bc k \u2032 , l \u2032 , m \u2032 , \u2026 ( 0 ) = \u03bc k , l , m , \u2026 ( 0 ) when the indices k \u2032, l \u2032, m \u2032,\u2026 are obtained from k , l , m ,\u2026 by replacing all indices 2 by 3, all indices 3 by 2, all indices 5 by 6, and all indices 6 by 5. We have determined the values of the expansion parameters in Eq. (8) , which we take to fourth order, in a least-squares fitting to the 3 \u00d7 10 080 ab initio dipole moment projections \u03bc \u00af \u00b7 e j , j = 1, 2, 3, calculated ab initio for PH 3 at the ATZfc level of theory. We could usefully vary 108 parameters in the final fitting, which had a root-mean-square (rms) deviation of 0.0008 D. This value can be compared to the typical finite-differences error from the ab initio calculations, which was estimated to be less than 0.0001 D. Table 1 lists the optimized parameter values. Parameters, whose absolute values were determined to be less than their standard errors in initial fittings, were constrained to zero in the final fitting and omitted from the table. Furthermore, we give in the tables only one member of each parameter pair related by Eq. (11) . We did not observe any improvement of the rms deviation from varying the parameter \u03b2 . Therefore it was set to 1.0 \u00c5 \u22121 and excluded from the fitting. From the MB representation of the ATZfc dipole moment surface, we calculate the equilibrium dipole moment as \u03bc e = 0.57736 D at the experimental equilibrium geometry of r 1 = r 2 = r 3 = r e = 1.412 \u00c5 and \u03b1 1 = \u03b1 2 = \u03b1 3 = \u03b1 e = 93.4\u00b0 [23,24] . The experimental value [25] for \u03bc e is 0.57397(20) D. 3 The potential energy surface The potential energy surface (PES) for the electronic ground state of PH 3 that we employ in the present work is based on an ab initio potential energy surface calculated at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory by Wang et al. [3] . As described below, we have refined the analytical representation of this surface in an empirical fitting to experimentally derived vibrational term values. The fitting was carried out by means of our variational method for calculating the rotation\u2013vibration energies of an XY 3 molecule directly from the potential energy function; this method is described in Refs. [6,7] , to which the reader is referred for details. In order to ensure a correct description of the PES for a large region of coordinate space, we represent the PES by a Morse-type parameterized expansion (PES type A in Ref. [7] ) (12) V ( \u03be 1 , \u03be 2 , \u03be 3 , \u03be 4 a , \u03be 4 b ; sin \u03c1 \u00af ) = V e + V 0 ( sin \u03c1 \u00af ) + \u2211 j F j ( sin \u03c1 \u00af ) \u03be j + \u2211 j \u2a7d k F jk ( sin \u03c1 \u00af ) \u03be j \u03be k + \u2211 j \u2a7d k \u2a7d l F jkl ( sin \u03c1 \u00af ) \u03be j \u03be k \u03be l + \u2211 j \u2a7d k \u2a7d l \u2a7d m F jklm ( sin \u03c1 \u00af ) \u03be j \u03be k \u03be l \u03be m in terms of the stretching variables (13) \u03be k = y k = 1 - exp [ - a ( r k - r e ) ] , k = 1 , 2 , 3 , where a is a Morse parameter, the symmetrized bending variables (14) \u03be 4 a = S 4 a = 1 6 ( 2 \u03b1 1 - \u03b1 2 - \u03b1 3 ) , (15) \u03be 4 b = S 4 b = 1 2 ( \u03b1 2 - \u03b1 3 ) and the variable (16) sin \u03c1 \u00af = 2 3 sin [ ( \u03b1 1 + \u03b1 2 + \u03b1 3 ) / 6 ] for the \u2018umbrella\u2019 motion. The pure inversion potential energy function in Eq. (12) is taken to be (17) V 0 ( sin \u03c1 \u00af ) = \u2211 s = 1 4 f 0 ( s ) ( sin \u03c1 e - sin \u03c1 \u00af ) s , and the functions F jk \u2026 ( sin \u03c1 \u00af ) are defined as (18) F jk \u2026 ( sin \u03c1 \u00af ) = \u2211 s = 0 N f jk \u2026 ( s ) ( sin \u03c1 e - sin \u03c1 \u00af ) s , where sin \u03c1 e is the equilibrium value of sin \u03c1 \u00af and the quantities f 0 ( s ) and f jk \u2026 ( s ) in Eqs. (17) and (18) are expansion coefficients. The summation limits in Eq. (18) are N = 3 for F j ( sin \u03c1 \u00af ) , N = 2 for F jk ( sin \u03c1 \u00af ) , N = 1 for F jkl ( sin \u03c1 \u00af ) , N = 0 for F jklm ( sin \u03c1 \u00af ) . In total there are 48 symmetrically unique potential parameters f jk \u2026 ( s ) . In the numerical integration of the inversion Schr\u00f6dinger equation a grid of 1000 points is used. The size of the vibrational basis set is controlled by the parameter P max defined so that (19) P = 2 ( v 1 + v 3 ) + v 2 + v 4 \u2a7d P max , where the vibrational quantum numbers v 1 , v 3 are associated with the stretching basis functions, v 2 describes the inversion excitation, and v 4 describes the excitation of the small-amplitude bending mode. For the fittings reported here, we use P max = 10. Initial values for the potential parameters f jk \u2026 ( s ) entering into Eqs. (17) and (18) are obtained by analytical transformation of the ab initio potential energy function given by Wang et al. [3] . The Morse parameter a is fixed to the value 1.6 \u00c5 \u22121 and the structural parameters r e and \u03b1 e are constrained to their experimentally determined equilibrium values [23,24] . The parameters f jk \u2026 ( s ) are then optimized in a fitting to 17 experimentally derived vibrational term values for 31 PH 3 ; these term values are all below 5000 cm \u22121 (where the energy zero is taken as the energy of the vibrational ground state). In order to prevent the refined PES from attaining an unrealistic shape at geometries much displaced from the equilibrium geometry, we restrained the refined PES to the initial ab initio surface by using also the ab initio data from Wang et al. [3] as input for the fitting in the manner described in Ref. [2] . For the 17 experimentally derived vibrational term values, we achieved the rms deviation of 1.5 cm \u22121 . For further details of the fitting method, the reader is referred to Ref. [2] , where we presented an initial fitting to vibrational term values of PH 3 . Owing to improvements in the theoretical model of the present work, relative to that used in Ref. [2] , the PES obtained in the present work is more accurate than that reported in Ref. [2] . The most notable improvement is the use of higher-order expansions to represent some terms in the nuclear kinetic energy operator; details are given in Ref. [7] . The optimized potential energy parameter values are compiled in Table 2 , while the corresponding, calculated term values are listed in Tables 3 and 4 and compared with the available experimental values. The total rms deviation between theory and experiment for the 28 term values given in Tables 3 and 4 is 1.5 cm \u22121 . The refined surface will be referred to as the ATZfc(R) surface. We change the vibrational basis set limit P max [Eq. (19) ] according to the maximum J value required: for purely vibrational transitions ( J = 0) we use P max = 12; when simulating rotation\u2013vibration absorption spectra ( J < 20) we use P max = 8; and to compute the line strengths of transitions involving highly excited cluster states ( J \u2a7d 60), P max is set to 6. In order to ensure a reasonable accuracy of the vibrational energies in all these simulations, we optimize the PES at a \u2018compromise\u2019 P max -value of 10. In this way we make the fitted parameter values absorb, as much as possible, the deficiencies resulting from the basis set truncation in the least-squares fitting. Thus, the ATZfc(R) parameters are \u2018effective.\u2019 Only when they are used in conjunction with our model for the rotation\u2013vibration motion can we be certain to obtain deviations from experiment around 1.5 cm \u22121 for the energies listed in Tables 3 and 4 . On the other hand, the effect of the basis set truncation is found to be less than 2.0 cm \u22121 in the worst case, and so we believe that the ATZfc(R) PES will also provide reasonable accuracy when used with other methods for calculating the rotation\u2013vibration energies and intensities. 4 Intensity calculations We aim at calculating intensities of electric dipole transitions within the ground electronic state of PH 3 . We neglect hyperfine structure (i.e., the effect of the nuclear spins on the molecular energies). In this approximation, the line strength of an individual rotation\u2013vibration transition (from an initial state i with rotation\u2013vibration wavefunction \u2223 \u03a6 rv ( i ) \u3009 to a final state f with rotation\u2013vibration wavefunction \u2223 \u03a6 rv ( f ) \u3009 ) within an isolated electronic state of an XY 3 pyramidal molecule is given by Eq. (21) of Ref. [8] . This expression is used in the intensity calculations reported in the present work. The rotation\u2013vibration wavefunctions \u2223 \u03a6 rv ( i ) \u3009 and \u2223 \u03a6 rv ( f ) \u3009 are obtained, together with the associated rotation\u2013vibration energies, in variational calculations with the theoretical model for describing the rotation and vibration of an XY 3 molecule [6,7] that we have already discussed in the preceding sections. The extension of the model to the computation of intensities is discussed in Refs. [8,9] . When simulating absorption spectra, we calculate for each rotation\u2013vibration line the integral of the absorption cofficient \u03f5 ( \u03bd \u02dc ) (which depends on the absorption wavenumber \u03bd \u02dc ) over the line; this quantity is proportional to the line strength and given by Eq. (6) of Ref. [8] . In addition to calculating the line strengths of individual rotation\u2013vibration transitions, we also compute vibrational transition moments defined as (20) \u03bc fi = \u2211 \u03b1 = x , y , z | \u3008 \u03a6 vib ( f ) \u2223 \u03bc \u00af \u03b1 \u2223 \u03a6 vib ( i ) \u3009 | 2 , where \u2223 \u03a6 vib ( w ) \u3009 , w = i or f , are vibrational wavefunctions describing states with J = 0. In the absence of strong Coriolis-type resonances, these transition moments determine the intensities of entire vibrational bands (see, for example, Ref. [26] ). The matrix elements required in Eq. (20) are generated by techniques described in Ref. [7] for matrix elements of the potential energy function. 5 Applications 5.1 Transition moments We have calculated the vibrational transition moments [Eq. (20) ] for selected vibrational bands of PH 3 . The calculation is based on the refined ATZfc(R) PES and the ab initio DMS described in Section 2 . The variational calculations to determine the rotation\u2013vibration energies and wavefunctions are made as described in Section 3 with P max = 12 [Eq. (19) ]. The results are included in Tables 3 and 4 . By comparing our theoretical values for the vibrational transition moments for PH 3 to experimental values and theoretical values from the literature [11] we can assess the quality of the ATZfc dipole moment surface. We make this comparison in Tables 3 and 4 . It is seen that the ATZfc DMS provides a reasonable description of the intensities of bands involving excitation of both stretching and bending modes. This is especially valuable for the simulations of spectra with transitions to highly excited vibrational states, for which strong interactions prevail. The relative deviation between experiment and theory is 1.6% for the \u2018permanent dipole moment\u2019 (the expectation value of the dipole moment in the vibrational ground state). For transition moments of the fundamental bands \u03bd 1 , \u03bd 2 , \u03bd 3 , and \u03bd 4 , the deviations are 6.1%, 2.5%, 6.9%, and 0.3%, respectively. The agreement is seen to be better for the two bending bands \u03bd 2 and \u03bd 4 . Our relative deviation for the stretching bands \u03bd 1 and \u03bd 3 is in accordance with the experimental accuracy, which was estimated to be larger than 10% [28] . 5.2 Simulations of spectra We report simulations of PH 3 absorption bands in three wavenumber regions: a region at 9 \u03bcm with transitions from the vibrational ground state to the state \u2018dyad\u2019 ( \u03bd 2 , \u03bd 4 ); a region at 5 \u03bcm with transitions to the \u2018pentad\u2019 (2 \u03bd 2 , \u03bd 2 + \u03bd 4 , 2 \u03bd 4 , \u03bd 1 , \u03bd 3 ); and a region at 3 \u03bcm with transitions to the manifold of states (3 \u03bd 2 , 2 \u03bd 2 + \u03bd 4 , \u03bd 2 + 2 \u03bd 4 , \u03bd 1 + \u03bd 2 , \u03bd 3 + \u03bd 2 , 3 \u03bd 4 , \u03bd 1 + \u03bd 4 , \u03bd 3 + \u03bd 4 ). The simulated bands contain rovibrational transitions between states with J < 20 and with the vibrational ground state as lower vibrational state. The term values of the upper states involved in the transitions are plotted in Fig. 1 as reduced energies E v , Jk - E v = 0 , Jk max against the angular momentum quantum number J . Here v is a short-hand notation for ( v 1 , v 2 , v 3 , v 4 ), v = 0 stands for the ground vibrational state, and E v = 0 , Jk max is the maximum energy for the J multiplet in question in the vibrational ground state. Variationally computed eigenfunctions (and eigenvalues) are labeled by the quantum numbers { v , J , k }, obtained from the basis function with the largest contribution to the wavefunction for the state in question. The term values in Fig. 1 exhibit a distinct polyad structure. In these polyads, there is often significant interaction between the individual rovibrational states, and this makes our { v , J , k } labeling ambiguous in many cases. Since the corresponding experimental assignment is ambiguous in a similar manner, the correlation between the theoretical and the experimental spectra is not always straightforward. The simulated spectra are drawn as stick diagrams in Figs. 2\u20134 . The height of the stick representing a line is the integrated absorption coefficient computed from Eq. (6) of Ref. [8] . The line strengths are computed with the spin statistical weight factors g ns = 8, 8, 8, respectively, for the A 1 , A 2 , and E symmetry levels. The simulations are made with the ATZfc(R) potential energy surface and the ATZfc dipole moment surface. As mentioned above, in order to reduce the sizes of the matrices to be diagonalized and thus make the calculations feasible, the vibrational basis set has P max = 8 [Eq. (19) ]. Even with this reduction the computed rovibrational wavefunctions consist of thousands of expansion terms. These wavefunctions are then used to calculate the matrix elements required in Eq. (20) . In order to facilitate this process we apply a pre-screening procedure to truncate the wavefunction expansions: all terms with contribution less than a given threshold are cut off and excluded from the integration. We found that the threshold of 10 \u22128 represents an appropriate compromise between the accuracy and the computation time. We compare the theoretical intensities for PH 3 with experimental data from the recent spectroscopic study of the fundamental transitions to the \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 dyad by Brown et al. [27] . In addition, Brown et al. [27] observed 64 transitions in the 2 \u03bd 2 \u2190 \u03bd 2 hot band, and so we also simulate this hot band. Our simulations are done with T = 300 K as the experimental spectra for the \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 and the 2 \u03bd 2 \u2190 \u03bd 2 bands [27] have been recorded at room temperature. In computing the integrated absorption coefficient, we use the partition function value Q = 4943.75; this value is obtained at T = 300 K from the variationally calculated term values with J < 20, v 1 \u2a7d 2, v 2 \u2a7d 6, v 3 \u2a7d 2, and v 4 \u2a7d 4. We discard transitions for which the calculated value of the integrated absorption coefficient (Eq. (6) of Ref. [8] ) is less than 10 \u22128 cm mol \u22121 . In Fig. 2 we show simulations of the \u03bd 2 , \u03bd 4 , and 2 \u03bd 2 \u2190 \u03bd 2 absorption bands of PH 3 . The bands are artificially separated according to the assignment of the upper state. Each simulated band is compared to an \u2018experimentally derived\u2019 stick spectrum drawn with experimental values for transition wavenumbers and intensities [27] ; these transitions are also artificially separated according to the \u2018experimental\u2019 assignment of the upper state. The experimentally derived spectra show only the transitions assigned in Ref. [27] and this explains why the experimental spectra generally contain less lines than the simulated ones. In the simulated and the experimentally derived stick spectra, the intensities are given as integrated absorption coefficients (Eq. (6) of Ref. [8] ) in cm mol \u22121 . The experimental values, originally [27] given in cm \u22122 atm \u22121 , were converted to cm mol \u22121 at T = 300 K. Note that the same absolute intensity scale is used for the two members of each theoretical/experimental spectrum pair. For the \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 and 2 \u03bd 2 \u2190 \u03bd 2 bands in Fig. 2 , there is remarkable agreement between the simulated and experimentally derived stick spectra. These results are in keeping with the close agreement between experiment and theory for the corresponding transition moment values in Tables 3 and 4 . The calculated value of 0.1152 D for the 2 \u03bd 2 \u2190 \u03bd 2 transition moment also agrees well with its experimental counterpart of 0.1177(4) D from Ref. [27] . In order to get a more quantitative measure of the accuracy of our intensity simulations, we have performed a line-by-line comparison between theoretical and experimental spectra. Brown et al. [27] have assigned a total of 979 lines in the experimental \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 spectrum. For the detailed line-by-line comparison we had to establish a one-to-one correspondence between the experimental and theoretical assignments. For 955 of the 979 lines, the quantum numbers assigned by Brown et al. [27] were identical to those assigned by our program from the basis functions with the largest contributions to the wavefunctions of the states involved in the transition. The remaining 24 lines could not be unambiguously related to the theoretical transitions and were excluded from the line-by-line analysis. This involved 10 relatively strong lines (with intensities between 1300 and 7000 cm mol \u22121 ), and 14 rather weak lines (with intensities <500 cm mol \u22121 ). Apart from these lines, there were also a number of cases in which one experimental transition corresponded to two theoretical ones; these transitions involve A 1 / A 2 level pairs that are effectively degenerate at low J . In such cases we included both theoretical intensity values in our analysis. In this way we ended up with 955 experimental transitions corresponding to 1138 theoretical intensity values, for which we obtain an average absolute percentage deviation between theoretical and experimental intensity values, defined as (21) \u0394 % = 100 \u00d7 1 N lin \u2211 i = 1 N lin \u2223 I obs ( i ) - I calc ( i ) \u2223 I obs ( i ) = 8.7 % , where N lin = 1138 is the number of transitions compared, and I obs ( i ) and I calc ( i ) are the observed and calculated intensities, respectively, of transition i . The transition wavenumbers have a root-mean-square deviation of 0.94 cm \u22121 for the 1138 transitions. The theoretical results are computed with a purely ab initio dipole moment function; no fitting of dipole moment parameters to experimental intensities has been made. Brown et al. [27] have carried out such a fitting to the observed \u03bd 2 and \u03bd 4 intensities and obtained intensity deviations of 1.5% and 2.1%, respectively. The \u2018pure\u2019 ab initio deviation of 8.7% that we achieve here is of course larger than the \u2018optimized\u2019 values, but not enormously so. In Figs. 3 and 4 we show simulations of the absorption bands from the second and third polyads of PH 3 , which make up the 5 \u03bcm and 3 \u03bcm regions, respectively. The bands \u03bd 1 / \u03bd 3 are much more intense than the other members of these systems; this agrees with the transition moments from Tables 3 and 4 . Because of the ambiguity of the assignment at high J mentioned above, some of the bands shown in Figs. 3 and 4 might contain transitions that do not belong to them. For example, three unusually strong branches appearing in the 2 \u03bd 4 2 band ( Fig. 3 ) probably borrow intensity from the \u03bd 1 / \u03bd 3 bands. Indeed, according to the vibrational transition moments from Tables 3 and 4 , the intensities from the 2 \u03bd 4 0 and 2 \u03bd 4 2 transitions must be on the order of 200 cm mol \u22121 and 50 cm mol \u22121 , respectively. The weakest bands that we consider correspond to vibrational transition moments on the order of magnitude of 0.001 D, to avoid uncertainties related to numerical issues (fitting accuracy, etc.). 5.3 Transitions between cluster states at high J As mentioned in Section 1 , we have recently shown [1] that in the vibrational ground state of PH 3 , the highly excited rotational states form clusters. There are two types of energy clusters found theoretically in the vibrational ground state of PH 3 : two-fold and six-fold clusters. The two-fold clusters are formed by the two energy levels characterized by the largest value of K c = \u2223 k c \u2223 = J [5,26] , where k c is the projection, in units of \u210f, of the total angular momentum onto the z axis, which coincides with the C 3 axis [26] for a PH 3 molecule in its equilibrium configuration (see Fig. 5 ). These levels have the lowest energies in each J multiplet, and the two-fold clusters are the \u2018usual\u2019 k c = \u00b1 J clusters found for an oblate symmetric top at high J . More unusually, the highest four rotational term values in each J multiplet form a six-fold cluster whose wavefunction components span the six-dimensional representation (22) A 1 \u2295 A 2 \u2295 2 E of the molecular symmetry group C 3v (M) [5,26] . The states at highest and lowest energy in each cluster span the A 1 \u2295 A 2 representation, whereby the state at highest energy has A 1 ( A 2 ) symmetry for J even(odd), while each of the two \u2018inner\u2019 energy levels belongs to the E symmetry representation so that these two energy levels are doubly degenerate. The rotational level clustering for the ground vibrational state of PH 3 is illustrated in Fig. 6 , where we plot the difference E v = 0 , Jk - E v = 0 , Jk max as a function of J ; E v = 0 , Jk max is here the maximum energy for the J multiplet in question. The energies are calculated from the ATZfc(R) potential energy surface as described in Section 4 ; the basis set used has P max = 6 [Eq. (19) ]. As J increases, the first six-fold cluster in the vibrational ground state of PH 3 forms at the top of the J manifold at J \u2248 35 (see Ref. [1] ); we also sometimes refer to this cluster as the \u2018top\u2019 one. The levels in the first cluster are shown as squares in the term value diagram of Fig. 6 . As J increases, more clusters form below the first one. We call these the second , third , \u2026 clusters, counted in order of descending energy. Table 5 gives the term values of the states in the first, second, and third clusters for selected J values. In all six-fold clusters, the six cluster states span the representation of C 3v (M) given in Eq. (22) . A detailed analysis of the cluster states has been given in Ref. [1] . In the present work, we report calculations of the line strength values for transitions connecting different cluster states. At equilibrium, PH 3 is an oblate rigid rotor [5] so that in rigid-rotor notation, the four highest energy levels at a given J value (i.e., the four energy levels making up the first cluster) have K c = 0, 1, 2, 3, respectively, when the energies are considered in descending order; the four levels making up the second cluster have K c = 3, 4, 5, 6, respectively, and so on for the following clusters. We use the standard notation K c = \u2223 k c \u2223, where the signed quantum number k c (\u2212 J \u2a7d k c \u2a7d J ) is defined in Ref. [5] . For PH 3 , rotation\u2013vibration transitions obey the general selection rules [5,26] (23) A 1 \u2194 A 2 and E \u2194 E . It can be shown [5] that as a consequence of this, in the vibrational ground state of PH 3 only rotational transitions with \u0394 k c = 3 t , where t is an integer, have non-vanishing intensity. Fig. 7 illustrates the \u2018cluster\u2019 transitions that we consider in the present work. In Fig. 7 (A) we show the so-called intra-cluster transitions, i.e., the \u0394 J = 0 transitions within a given cluster. Two kinds of these satisfy Eq. (23) : an A 1 \u2194 A 2 transition connects the lowest level of the cluster with the highest one, and an E \u2194 E transition connects the two \u2018inner\u2019 levels. In the first cluster, the A 1 \u2194 A 2 transition corresponds to k c = 0 \u2190 \u00b1 3, and the E \u2194 E transition corresponds to k c = \u00b11 \u2190 \u2213 2 where the signs are correlated. Consequently, both of these transitions are \u0394 k c = \u00b13 transitions. Fig. 7 (B) defines the \u0394 J = 0 inter-cluster absorption transitions starting in the second cluster and ending in the first cluster. There are two A 1 \u2194 A 2 transitions of this type. One starts in the top state of the second cluster and ends in the bottom state of the first cluster. Both of these states have K c = 3 in rigid-rotor notation, and so the corresponding transition has \u0394 k c = 0. The other A 1 \u2194 A 2 transition connects the bottom state of the second cluster with the top state of the first cluster; it obviously has \u0394 k c = \u00b16. There are four E \u2194 E transitions between the two adjacent clusters. In the first cluster, the two E states have K c = 1 and 2, respectively, while the corresponding E states for the second cluster have K c = 4 and 5, respectively. Thus, of the four E \u2194 E inter-cluster transitions two correspond to k c = \u00b11 \u2190 \u00b14 and k c = \u00b12 \u2190 \u00b15, respectively, and have \u0394 k c = \u00b13. The other two correspond to k c = \u00b11 \u2190 \u22135 and k c = \u00b12 \u2190 \u22134, respectively, and have \u0394 k c = \u00b16. Finally, in Fig. 7 (C) we show the \u0394 J = 1 transitions connecting the first cluster at J \u2212 1 with that at J . In each of the two clusters, the energy levels have K c = 0, 1, 2, 3, respectively, and the dominant inter-cluster transitions have \u0394 k c = 0; we have four such transitions with k c = 0 \u2190 0, \u00b11 \u2190 \u00b11, \u00b12 \u2190 \u00b12, and \u00b13 \u2190 \u00b13, respectively. The k c = 0 \u2190 0 and \u00b13 \u2190 \u00b13 transitions are A 1 \u2194 A 2 (the A 1 / A 2 symmetry label of the top and bottom cluster state alternates with the parity of J ), and the two other transitions are E \u2194 E . In principle, there are two further E \u2194 E transitions with k c = \u00b11 \u2190 \u22132 and k c = \u00b12 \u2190 \u22131, respectively (i.e., with \u0394 k c = \u00b13), analogous to the E \u2194 E transitions in Fig. 7 (A). However we neglect these in Fig. 7 (C) since they are very weak in comparison with the \u0394 k c = 0 transitions (see, for example, Refs. [5,26] ). In the present work, we compute the transition wavenumbers and line strengths of the transitions defined in Fig. 7 numerically by variational methods. The line strengths are calculated from Eq. (21) of Ref. [8] . In order to understand the numerical results, however, it is useful to consider also the customary approach to molecular rotation\u2013vibration theory (see Ref. [29] or the review articles [30,31] ). To calculate spectra in the customary approach, we solve the rotation\u2013vibration Schr\u00f6dinger equation by diagonalizing the matrix representation of the rotation\u2013vibration Hamiltonian H \u02c6 rv set up in a harmonic-oscillator/rigid-rotor basis. The diagonalization is carried out by means of successive contact transformations [29\u201331] . The contact transformation method is based on perturbation theory, it leads to a Hamiltonian that can be directly related to the models used for interpreting experimental spectra. The line strengths of rotational and rotation\u2013vibration transitions depend on the dipole moment components \u03bc \u00af A , A = X , Y , Z , along the space-fixed (or laboratory-fixed) axes XYZ [5,29] . To obtain rovibrational line strengths in the contact-transformation scheme, we first express the space-fixed dipole moment components \u03bc \u00af A in terms of the components ( \u03bc x , \u03bc y , \u03bc z ) along the molecule-fixed axes xyz . This axis system is chosen such that it follows the rotational motion of the molecule; for details see, for example, Refs. [5,29,31] . We have (24) \u03bc \u00af A = \u2211 \u03b1 = x , y , z \u03bb \u03b1 A \u03bc \u00af \u03b1 , where the \u03bb \u03b1A are direction cosines (see, for example, [5] ) effecting the transformation between the xyz and XYZ axis systems. The quantity \u03bc \u00af \u03b1 depends on the nuclear coordinates. It can be expressed as a Taylor expansion in the normal coordinates of the molecule. We now introduce the effective dipole moment operator (25) \u03bc \u02dc A = e i S \u02c6 \u2211 \u03b1 = x , y , z \u03bb \u03b1 A \u03bc \u00af \u03b1 e - i S \u02c6 , which is obtained from the \u2018untransformed\u2019 dipole moment operator by the same contact transformation that was applied to the rotation\u2013vibration Hamiltonian H \u02c6 rv in order to obtain an effective rotational Hamiltonian, the so-called Watsonian H \u02dc rv [29] . Here, S \u02c6 is a Hermitian operator that effects the contact transformation on H \u02c6 rv . The resulting effective operator \u03bc \u02dc A , and its matrix elements between harmonic-oscillator/rigid-rotor basis functions (which determine the rovibrational line strengths), have a very complex form, especially at high order of the expansion. The values of the constant expansion coefficients in \u03bc \u02dc A can be obtained by fitting to experimentally determined line strengths, just as the parameter values in the Watsonian H \u02dc rv are determined in fittings to experimentally derived energy differences. For C 3v molecules, intensity expressions have been obtained in the customary approach by Tarrago et al. [32] . We will use these expressions to explain qualitatively the main features of the cluster transitions in Fig. 7 . In Fig. 8 we plot against J the transition wavenumbers and line strengths, respectively, of the \u0394 J = 0 intra-cluster transitions defined in Fig. 7 (A) for the first, second, and third clusters formed in the vibrational ground state of PH 3 . As the clusters form for high J , the wavenumbers of all the intra-cluster transitions tend to zero [ Fig. 8 (a)]. As discussed above, these transitions all have \u0394 k c = \u00b13, and so they have zero intensity in the absence of rotation\u2013vibration interaction [5,26] but steal intensity from the fundamental vibrational transitions by a mechanism analogous to that discussed for H 3 + in Section 14.1.14 of Ref. [5] . The intensity stealing is induced by rotation\u2013vibration interaction between the vibrational ground state and excited vibrational states; the same interaction gives rise to centrifugal distortion effects. According to Ref. [32] , the line strengths S if for the \u0394 k c = \u00b13 transitions are given by (26) S if = g ns d 03 2 2 J + 1 J ( J + 1 ) ( J \u2213 K c ) ( J \u00b1 K c + 1 ) ( J \u2213 K c - 1 ) ( J \u00b1 K c + 2 ) ( J \u2213 K c - 2 ) ( J \u00b1 K c + 3 ) , where the dipole moment parameter d 03 is an adjustable parameter. For K c fixed, this expression increases with J and yields S if \u223c J 5 asymptotically for high J . This variation explains the moderate- J part (with J < 40) of Fig. 8 (b). However, at J > 40, the line strengths exhibit an almost linear dependence on J , both for the A 1 \u2194 A 2 and the E \u2194 E transitions. This effect reflects a qualitative change in the molecular motion, and indicates that for these highly excited states, corrections to Eq. (26) are necessary. A corresponding extension of the customary approximation will be discussed in detail below, where we take into account the dynamic effects explicitly by introducing a body-fixed xyz coordinate system suitable at very high J . Fig. 9 shows the J -dependence of (a) the wavenumbers and (b) the line strengths for the \u0394 J = 0 inter-cluster absorption transitions defined in Fig. 7 (B). One progression comprises the transitions starting in the top state of the second cluster and ending in the bottom state of the first cluster. As discussed above, these transitions have \u0394 k c = 0; they have non-vanishing intensity also in the absence of rotation\u2013vibration interaction. However, in the absence of rotation\u2013vibration interaction they occur at zero wavenumber since the two states with k c = \u00b13 are degenerate for a rigid PH 3 molecule. At low J , rotation\u2013vibration interaction is weak and the A 1 \u2194 A 2 transitions with \u0394 k c = 0 have appreciable intensity but a vanishingly low wavenumber as shown by the squares in the display (a) of Fig. 9 . According to Ref. [32] , the \u0394 k c = 0, \u0394 J = 0 line strengths are given by (27) S if = g ns d 0 2 2 J + 1 J ( J + 1 ) K c 2 (see also Eq. (12.31), in conjunction with Table 12.1, of Ref. [26] ). In Eq. (27) d 0 is a dipole moment parameter. This S if decreases with J and varies asymptotically as 2 K c 2 / J for large J . The K c = 3 \u2190 3 line strengths, shown by the squares in the display (b) of Fig. 9 , indeed vary in this manner for low J . In Fig. 9 (b) we show the function 23.7 D 2 \u00d7 (2 J + 1)/[ J ( J + 1)] as a dotted line. The factor g ns d 0 2 K c 2 = 23.7 D 2 is computed using d 0 = \u03bc fi = 0.57395 D (the experimental value of the ground state vibrational transition moment [25] , see Table 3 ) and g ns = 8. The other progression of A 1 \u2194 A 2 transitions analyzed in the display (b) of Fig. 9 has k c = 0 \u2190 \u00b16 and therefore \u0394 k c = \u00b16 (shown by the circles); these transitions connect the bottom state of the second cluster with the top state of the first cluster. They gain intensity by rotation\u2013vibration interaction and have zero intensity in the absence of this interaction. If we apply the contact transformation formalism [32] to these k c = 0 \u2190 \u00b16 transitions, we obtain S if \u223c J 11 , which is in keeping with the variation exhibited by the circle transitions for J < 40 in Fig. 9 (a). As the first and second clusters form for J > 45, the two progressions of A 1 \u2194 A 2 transitions attain comparable wavenumbers and intensities, so that in Fig. 9 (a), all the curves coalesce in this J region. In Fig. 9 , we also present the computed wavenumber and line-strength data for the E \u2194 E transitions defined in Fig. 7 (B). The customary approach yields S if \u223c J 5 for \u0394 k c = \u00b13 transitions and S if \u223c J 11 for \u0394 k c = \u00b16 transitions. This explains, at least to some extent, the intensity variation for J < 35 in Fig. 9 (a), shown by the solid, dashed, and dot-dash lines. At higher J values, the \u0394 k c = \u00b16 transitions keep gaining intensity with increasing J in accordance with the J 11 -variation, whereas the \u0394 k c = \u00b13 transitions lose intensity. The customary approach obviously does not explain the intensities of the \u0394 k c = \u00b13 transitions at very high J . As the first and second clusters form for J > 45, the two progressions of E \u2194 E transitions with \u0394 k c = \u00b16 merge, their wavenumbers and intensities become more or less identical, and identical to those of the corresponding A 1 \u2194 A 2 transitions in Fig. 9 (a). The two progressions of E \u2194 E transitions with \u0394 k c = \u00b13 follow the other progressions in wavenumber, but their intensities die out. Finally, Fig. 10 shows the wavenumbers and line strengths of the \u0394 J = 1, \u0394 k c = 0 inter-cluster transitions defined in Fig. 7 (C). These transitions all have non-vanishing intensity in the absence of rotation\u2013vibration interaction, and so they belong to the \u2018normal\u2019, allowed rotational spectrum of PH 3 . This manifests itself in the fact that these lines are much stronger than the perturbation-allowed transitions considered in Fig. 9 . In the absence of rotation\u2013vibration interaction, Eq. (12.31), in conjunction with Table 12.1, of Ref. [26] give the line strengths of these J \u2190 J \u2212 1 transitions as (28) S if = g ns d 0 2 J 2 - K c 2 J . For K c = 0, this expression predicts the line strength to be proportional to J , and this is borne out by the results in Fig. 10 (b) at moderate rotational excitation ( J < 40). Using the experimental value of the vibrational transition moment d 0 in Eq. (28) , we determine S if = 2.6 D 2 \u00d7 J , which is shown in Fig. 10 as a dotted line. At very high J values the computed line strengths deviate from this straight line; at J = 60 they only have about half the value estimated from the linear dependence. For all the \u2018cluster\u2019 transitions investigated here, we find that at J > 35, say, it becomes difficult to explain the variationally computed intensities in terms of the customary approach. This behavior is obviously caused by the six-fold cluster formation which sets in at these J values as discussed in Ref. [1] . During the cluster formation, the molecular rotation undergoes an important qualitative change in that the rotation axis changes; we can describe this by a change of the molecule-fixed axis system. In the classical picture the axis of rotation, associated with the topmost term values (with K c = 0, 1, 2, 3) in each J manifold, gradually changes its orientation as the rotational excitation increases. At low J it lies in the plane perpendicular to the C 3 symmetry axis of the molecule, chosen as the molecule-fixed z axis, while at J \u226b 1 it tends to coincide with one of the P\u2013H bonds [1] . This process is illustrated in Fig. 5 , where the rotational axis is labeled A . We aim at explaining the anomalous cluster intensities calculated variationally for J > 35 in terms of an alternative model, in which we change the molecule-fixed axis system so that one of the axes coincides with the rotational axis A . This new model involves four approximations: (1) We consider PH 3 at the so-called strict local mode limit [33] , which is based on the assumption that m P \u226b m H ( m P and m H are the masses of the atoms P and H, respectively), that all bonds are exactly perpendicular to each other, and that all inter-mode interactions are negligible, including the vibration\u2013vibration and rotation\u2013vibration interactions. In this limit, the axis of stable rotation A coincides exactly with one of the P\u2013H molecular bonds, say P\u2013H i (where the protons are labeled by i = 1, 2, 3) at J \u226b 1 [1] . It is then natural to choose the new molecule-fixed axis system x i y i z i (see Fig. 5 ) in such a way that the z i axis lies along the P\u2013H i bond. The other two axes x i and y i are then oriented along the two other bonds (which are exactly perpendicular to each other in the strict local mode limit) so that the x i y i z i axis system is right-handed. 2 The origin of x i y i z i is at the molecular center of mass which, under the strict local mode conditions, coincides with the P nucleus. 2 The axes of the new x i y i z i axis system coincide with the unit vectors e i defined for the MB system in Eq. (2) . (2) The rotational wavefunctions corresponding to the cluster states in the x i y i z i axis system are taken to be Wang-type rigid-rotor functions, and so the rotation\u2013vibration wavefunctions are given by (29) \u03a8 v , J , K i , \u03c4 = | v \u3009 1 2 | JK i \u3009 + ( - 1 ) \u03c4 | J - K i \u3009 , where \u03c4 = 0, 1, K i = \u2223 k i \u2223 with k i as the projection of the angular momentum onto the z i axis in units of \u210f, and \u2223 v \u3009 is a purely vibrational function. In formulating Eq. (29) we have assumed that there is no vibration\u2013rotation interaction so that K i is a good quantum number. (3) In expressing the dipole moment function \u03bc \u00af in the new coordinate system x i y i z i , we use the fact that the unit vectors e i define the x i y i z i axes, and we obtain from Eq. (1) (30) \u03bc \u00af = \u03bc 0 (LM) ( e 1 + e 2 + e 3 ) , where the constant (31) \u03bc 0 (LM) = \u03bc \u00af 1 Bond ( r 1 = r 2 = r 3 = r e , \u03b1 1 = \u03b1 2 = \u03b1 3 = 90 \u00b0 ) is defined by the strict local mode limit. For r 1 = r 2 = r 3 and \u03b1 1 = \u03b1 2 = \u03b1 3 we have \u03bc \u00af 1 Bond = \u03bc \u00af 2 Bond = \u03bc \u00af 3 Bond . (4) The symmetrized cluster wavefunctions are linear combinations of the wavefunctions in Eq. (29) . However, in determining line strengths we neglect contributions that involve wavefunctions from Eq. (29) with different values of i . The line strength obtained with these approximations is given by Eq. (12.31) of Ref. [26] (32) S if = g ( i ) ( 2 J + 1 ) v T \u0394 k i 1 ( \u03bc \u00af ) v 2 A ( J , k i , J \u2032 , k i \u2032 ) where (33) g ( i ) = 2 g ns ( i ) for ( K i , K i \u2032 ) = ( 0 , 1 ) or ( 1 , 0 ) g ns ( i ) otherwise , with g ns ( i ) as the nuclear spin statistical weight. Selection rules exist for the parameter \u03c4 in Eq. (29); Eq. (32) gives the line strengths of the transitions satisfying these selection rules. The irreducible tensor operators T \u0394 k i 1 ( \u03bc \u00af ) (with \u0394 k i = k i \u2032 - k i = 0 , \u00b1 1 ) in Eq. (32) are given by (34) T \u00b1 1 1 ( \u03bc \u00af ) = 1 2 ( \u2213 \u03bc \u00af x i - i \u03bc \u00af y i ) and (35) T 0 1 ( \u03bc \u00af ) = \u03bc \u00af z i , where ( \u03bc \u00af x i , \u03bc \u00af y i , \u03bc \u00af z i ) are the dipole moment components in the x i y i z i axis system, and the H\u00f6nl-London-factor A ( J , k i , J \u2032, k i \u2032) is defined in Table 12.1 of Ref. [26] . Strictly speaking, it makes no sense to define a spin statistical weight factor g ns ( i ) for the un-symmetrized wavefunctions from Eq. (29) . However, these wavefunctions are all symmetrically equivalent, and as the six cluster states give rise to 32 total internal states [5] allowed by Fermi-Dirac statistics, it would seem reasonable to distribute these 32 spin states evenly over the six rotation\u2013vibration states so that g ns ( i ) = 32 / 6 = 16 / 3 in Eq. (32) . This value is also obtained by formal application of the Landau-Lifshitz method for determining spin statistical weight factors (see Chapter 8 of Ref. [5] ). It follows from Eqs. (30), (34), and (35) that (36) v T 0 1 ( \u03bc \u00af ) v 2 = v T \u00b1 1 1 ( \u03bc \u00af ) v 2 = \u03bc 0 (LM) 2 . In the x i y i z i coordinate system the cluster states are characterized by K i = \u2223 k i \u2223 \u2248 J . When we insert the transition moment squares from Eq. (36) and the H\u00f6nl-London factors from Table 12.1 of Ref. [26] in Eq. (32) at the limit J \u226b 1 and K i \u2192 J , we derive the line strengths (37) (A) \u0394 J = 0 , \u0394 K i = 0 : S if = g ns ( i ) ( \u03bc 0 (LM) ) 2 ( 2 J + 1 ) , (B) \u0394 J = 0 , \u0394 K i = 1 : S if = g ns ( i ) ( \u03bc 0 (LM) ) 2 ( 2 J + 1 ) / ( J + 1 ) , (C) \u0394 J = 1 , \u0394 K i = 1 : S if = g ns ( i ) ( \u03bc 0 (LM) ) 2 ( 2 J + 1 ) , where the labels (A), (B), (C) refer to Fig. 7 . Thus, for the intra-cluster transitions in Fig. 7 (A), we obtain from Eq. (37) that the line strength varies linearly with J at high J . In terms of the wavefunctions given by Eq. (29) , there are three symmetrically equivalent intra-cluster transitions, each with a line strength given by Expression (A) in Eq. (37) . Fig. 7 (A) shows, however, that in reality there are only two symmetry-allowed intra-cluster transitions with K c = 0 \u2190 3 and 1 \u2190 2, respectively. We combine the line strengths of the three \u2018un-symmetrized transitions\u2019 and distribute the total line strength evenly over the two symmetry-allowed ones. Each of these two transitions then gets a line strength of 3 g ns ( i ) ( 2 J + 1 ) ( \u03bc 0 (LM) ) 2 / 2 . Since, in the strict local mode limit, the vector e 1 + e 2 + e 3 has a length of 3 , we can estimate the constant \u03bc 0 (LM) \u2248 \u03bc e / 3 \u2248 0.33 D , where \u03bc e = 0.57736 D is the equilibrium dipole moment. Thus Expression (A) in Eq. (37) gives S fi = 3 g ns ( i ) ( 2 J + 1 ) ( \u03bc 0 (LM) ) 2 / 2 \u2248 ( 2 J + 1 ) \u00d7 0.9 D 2 \u2248 J \u00d7 1.8 D 2 for J \u226b 1. The computed line strengths in Fig. 8 (b) exhibit a linear dependence on J at high J , but the slopes of the lines are around 1 D 2 and thus significantly smaller than the predicted value of 1.8 D 2 . We can take this as an indication that, as discussed also in Ref. [1] , for PH 3 the local mode limit has not yet been reached at J = 60. For the inter-cluster transitions in Fig. 7 (B), the line strengths are predicted to reach a limiting value at high J . In this case there are six \u2018un-symmetrized transitions\u2019 that satisfy the selection rules on \u03c4 , and four symmetry-allowed ones. Thus we obtain a limiting value of 3 g ns ( i ) ( \u03bc 0 (LM) ) 2 \u2248 1.8 D 2 . We determine from Fig. 9 that for J = 60, the line strengths have values around 2 D 2 , which is close to the limiting value that we estimate. At low J , the line strengths of the \u0394 J = 1 transitions in Fig. 7 (C) vary approximately as S if = J \u00d7 2.6 D 2 [Eq. (28) , dotted line in Fig. 10 (b)]. Our approximate theory (again with six \u2018un-symmetrized transitions\u2019 and four symmetry-allowed ones) predicts that at high J , they should also depend linearly on J , but with a smaller rate of increase: S if = J \u00d7 1.8 D 2 [dash-dotted line in Fig. 10 (b)]. There is some indication of this behavior in Fig. 10 (b): for J between 25 and 35, the calculated line strengths define an nearly straight line parallel to the dash-dot line. For higher J , however, the line strengths increase slower than J \u00d7 1.8 D 2 and eventually start decreasing; the difference in centrifugal distortion effects when J is increased by one is probably important here. A significant part of the discrepancies between the results of the approximate model and those of the variational calculation are caused by the fact that PH 3 is not at the strict local mode limit. In reality, the ratio m P / m H is not sufficiently large to put the center of mass at the P nucleus, and so as found in Ref. [1] , at J = 60 (or even at J = 80) the axis of rotation does not coincide completely with a P\u2013H bond. Test variational calculations with m P = 500 u (so that we really have m P \u226b m H ), no coupling between the vibrational modes in the potential energy function, and 90\u00b0 bond angles give a significantly better agreement with the results of the approximate model than that obtained with the calculations reported here for the \u2018real existing\u2019 PH 3 molecule. We conclude that for PH 3 , the cluster-formation (or localization) effects appearing in the rotational energy level spectrum cause very significant qualitative changes to the cluster-transition line strength values at high J . 6 Summary and conclusion We have computed ab initio , at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory, the dipole moment for the electronic ground state of PH 3 at 10 080 unique molecular geometries covering a large volume of vibrational coordinate space. A six-dimensional, Molecular-Bond representation of the dipole moment surface has been obtained by fitting suitable parameterized analytical functions through the ab initio points; see Eqs. (1)\u2013(10) . We have used this analytical DMS to calculate vibrational transition moments for selected vibrational bands. The theoretical transition moments were found to reproduce very satisfactorily the available experimentally determined values. By means of recently developed computational methods for calculating rotation\u2013vibration energies and intensities for isolated electronic states of XY 3 pyramidal molecules [7,8] , we have simulated several rotation\u2013vibration bands of PH 3 ; the wavenumbers and intensities determined for the individual transitions in these bands are also in very satisfactory agreement with experimental data. For example, for the \u03bd 2 / \u03bd 4 fundamental bands, whose upper states interact, we reproduce, with our purely ab initio DMS, 955 observed [27] intensity values with an average absolute percentage deviation of 8.7% (and a root-mean-square deviation of 0.94 cm \u22121 for the transition wavenumbers). The deviation of 8.7% is larger than the 1.5% and 2.1% obtained by Brown et al. [27] in a least-squares fitting to the experimental intensity values for the \u03bd 2 and \u03bd 4 bands, respectively, but we find the relatively small difference encouraging. It shows that ab initio calculations are reaching a level of accuracy where they can provide intensity data of sufficient quality to compete with the very often exceedingly difficult experimental intensity measurements (see also Ref. [34] ). Using our theoretical model for the rotation\u2013vibration motion of an XY 3 molecule [6\u20139,35] , which is based on the Hougen\u2013Bunker\u2013Johns approach [5,10] , we can calculate the energies and wavefunctions of highly excited rotational states [1] and the line strengths of the transitions that involve these states. We have already shown [1] that in the vibrational ground state of PH 3 , at high rotational excitations the energy levels cluster to produce six-fold near-degenerate states, and in the present work we have studied the line strengths of the transitions between these states. In particular, the so-called intra-cluster transitions ( Fig. 8 ) have wavenumbers that tend to zero as J increases. That is, with increasing J these transitions move through the THz, mm-wave, and microwave regions where spectroscopy with ultra-high resolution and ultra-high sensitivity is possible. Thus, one could imagine that the cluster states could be characterized by such spectroscopic methods as it happened for the analogous cluster states in H 2 Se [36] . The investigation of these states could help elucidate the phenomenon of rotationally induced chirality discussed for triatomic molecules by Bunker and Jensen [37] . The problem is, however, that the energy clusters are found at very high term values (see Table 5 ) so that a relatively high temperature is needed to populate the initial states of the intra-cluster transitions. Even then, the transitions will be weak and require experiments at high PH 3 pressure to be detected. The unfortunate fact that PH 3 is both poisonous and volatile may dampen the enthusiasm for undertaking experimental investigations of the interesting cluster phenomenon in this molecule. After we had submitted the initial version of the present work, Butler et al. [38] reported new measurements of phosphine intensities in the 2.8\u20133.7 \u03bcm region. They did not, however, use the experimental intensity values to determine vibrational transition moments that we can compare with our theoretical results. Instead they list, for a number of bands, \u2018sum intensities\u2019 (i.e., sums of the intensities of observed/assigned transitions in a given band) which provide rough measures of the total band intensity. Sum intensities obtained from our simulated spectra show broad agreement with the new experimental values so that this comparison provides further validation of our new ab initio dipole moment surface for the electronic ground state of PH 3 .

The simulations are carried out with the variational computer program TROVE in conjunction with recently reported ab initio potential energy and electric dipole moment surfaces. HSOH is a near-prolate-symmetric top at equilibrium and the simulated spectra are of perpendicular-band-type with strong R-branch and Q-branch transitions. Recently, an anomalous (b-type-transition)/(c-type-transition) intensity ratio in the vibrational-ground-state (r)Q(K(a))-branches of HSOH has been experimentally observed. Our calculations reproduce correctly the anomaly and show that it originates in the large-amplitude torsional motion of HSOH. We analyze our theoretical results in order to explain the effect and to provide unambiguous (b/c)-type-transition assignments.",

The energy range covered extends up to 20 000 cm \u22121 above equilibrium. Parameterized analytical functions have been fitted through the ab initio points. Based on the analytical potential energy and dipole moment surfaces obtained, vibrational term values and transition moments have been calculated by means of the variational program TROVE. The theoretical term values for the fundamental levels \u03bd SH (SH-stretch) and \u03bd OH (OH-stretch), the intensity ratio of the corresponding fundamental bands, and the torsional splitting in the vibrational ground state are in good agreement with experiment. This is evidence for the high quality of the potential energy surface. The theoretical results underline the importance of vibrational averaging, and they allow us to explain extensive perturbations recently found experimentally in the SH-stretch fundamental band of HSOH.

Even though the basis-set superposition error is still quite large at this level, it seems remarkable that there is no destabilization even for Xe@C 60 . Unlike 3 He, which is shielded by \u22126 ppm in He@C 60 , 129 Xe is predicted to be deshielded in Xe@C 60 (by ca. + 60 to +70 ppm) and also in the higher fullerence compounds Xe@C 70 and Xe@C 84 (by smaller amounts).",

        "abstract": "The Bergman cyclization of the natural enediyne dynemicin A in its triggered form (2) bound to the minor groove of DNA is compared with the corresponding reaction of its open isomer (4) utilizing QM/MM methodology. The two isomers are typical representatives of 10-membered cyclic (2) and acyclic (4) enediynes, which possess significantly different barriers for the Bergman reaction in the gas phase (2, 20.4 kcal/mol; 4, 31.3 kcal/mol). In the case of the cyclic enediyne (2) the explicit consideration of environmental factors such as the receptor DNA, the solvent water, and charge neutralization by counterions has only minor effects on the energy profile of the cyclization reaction and the corresponding optimized structures when compared with the gas phase. The energetics of the reaction is predominantly determined by QM (electronic) effects. This makes it possible to replace the explicit description of the environment by an implicit one, thus avoiding costly QM/MM calculations and using instead a decoupled QM+MM approach. A conformationally driven hinge mechanism is identified for 2 that makes it possible for the ligand to adjust to the dimensions of the minor groove without significant energy loss. In the case of the acyclic enediyne 4 a QM/MM treatment is necessary to describe the Bergman cyclization in the minor groove. QM/MM corrects the cyclization barrier from 31.3 to 23.7 kcal/mol, which makes the reaction feasible under physiological conditions. The reduction of the barrier is a result of transition-state stabilization, which is caused by an increased dipole moment and hence stronger electrostatic interactions with the environment. In both cases the anionic charge of dynemicin A is largely shielded by water solvation and ion pair formation so that it does not significantly affect the energetics of the Bergman cyclization.",

Various energy partitioning analyses indicate the origin of these differences and the role of the active site residues for different substrate orientations. The proposed new model C is preferred over the previously used models A and B because it combines favorable substrate binding geometries with reasonable barriers and is consistent with the experimental evidence from mutation studies concerning the catalytic ability of specific residues in the binding site, especially R11'.",

        "abstract": "The semiempirical methods of the OMx family (orthogonalization models OM1, OM2, and OM3) are known to describe biochemical systems more accurately than standard semiempirical approaches such as AM1. We investigate the benefits of augmenting these methods with an empirical dispersion term (OMx-D) taken from recent density functional work, without modifying the standard OMx parameters. Significant improvements are achieved for non-covalent interactions, with mean unsigned errors of 1.41 kcal/mol (OM2-D) and 1.31 kcal/mol (OM3-D) for the binding energy of the complexes in the JSCH-2005 data base. This supports the use of these augmented methods in quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) studies of biomolecules, for example during system preparation and equilibration. As an illustrative application, we present QM and QM/MM calculations on the binding between antibody 34E4 and a hapten, where OM3-D performs better than the methods without dispersion terms (AM1, OM3).",

        "title": "Mechanism of olefin hydrosilylation catalyzed by [RuCl(NCCH3)5]+: A DFT study",
        "abstract": "The hydrosilylation reaction between methyldimethoxysilane and methylvinyldimethoxysilane, catalyzed by the cationic species chloropenta(acetonitrile)ruthenium(II) + ( C1 ), was investigated with density functional theory (DFT). The Chalk\u2013Harrod, Glaser\u2013Tilley and \u03c3-bond metathesis mechanisms were considered as mechanistic possibilities for the reaction and enthalpy profiles of each pathway were computed for the active form of C1 . In contrast to the commonly accepted Chalk\u2013Harrod mechanism of hydrosilylation, the computational results indicate that a \u03c3-bond metathesis mechanism, involving the formation of a hydride analogue of C1 , is most favored. The B3LYP calculated activation enthalpy for this pathway (\u0394 H act = 13.1 kcal/mol) is consistent with the experimental observation that C1 is a reasonable catalyst for this reaction under the applied experimental conditions. Keywords Density functional theory B3LYP Ruthenium Hydrosilylation Chalk\u2013Harrod mechanism Glaser\u2013Tilley mechanism \u03c3 -Bond metathesis 1 Introduction Hydrosilylation, the addition of hydrosilanes across unsaturated bonds [1\u20134] , is an important reaction in the process of creating organosilicon building blocks. These building blocks are subsequently used in the construction of commercially available silicon based products, such as: silicone rubber, liquid injection molding compounds, paper release coatings, pressure sensitive adhesives, binders and coupling agents [2,5\u20137] . Hydrosilylation reactions are normally performed under mild conditions in the presence of a catalyst [1\u20134] . The most common catalysts for these reactions have traditionally been platinum based compounds owing to their high activity and the ability to control their reactivity by altering the experimental conditions [1\u20134,8] . One avenue for controlling the activity of platinum based compounds is through the manipulation of the active species generated in the induction phase [8] . This type of selectivity was successfully applied for a particular class of platinum based catalysts, bis(alkynyl)(1,5-cyclooctadiene)platinum complexes (COD)Pt(CCR) 2 [9] . Other transition metal compounds can catalyze the hydrosilylation reaction as well, e.g. those based on ruthenium [10\u201319] . However, such catalysts generally suffer from a loss of activity and/or selectivity relative to platinum catalysts, and they may induce side reactions of the substrates including olefin isomerization, dehydrogenative silylation and hydrogenation. Nonetheless, some very selective ruthenium catalysts have been found for the regioselective hydrosilylation of alkynes, especially the cationic ruthenium species [Cp \u2217 Ru(NCMe) 3 ]PF 6 which has been extensively used by Trost and Ball [13,14] . Another ionic ruthenium species, [RuCl(NCCH 3 ) 5 ][RuCl 4 (NCCH 3 ) 2 ] has been shown to be a very effective catalyst in the hydrosilylation of CO 2 with tri- and diorganosilanes [20,21] . These studies prompted us to investigate the activity of the latter catalyst in the hydrosilylation of C C-functional substrates. A preliminary test reaction of diethoxymethylsilane with diethoxymethylvinylsilane indicated that the activity of the catalyst was indeed reasonable (see Section 2 ). To optimize ionic catalysts such as [RuCl(NCCH 3 ) 5 ][RuCl 4 (NCCH 3 ) 2 ] it is essential to understand the catalytic mechanism. Thus, we present in this report the results of a computational investigation of the mechanism by which the Ru(II) cation [RuCl(NCCH 3 ) 5 ] + ( C1 ) catalyzes the reaction between dimethoxymethylsilane ( R1 ) and dimethoxymethylvinylsilane ( R2 ) to form 1,2-bis(dimethoxymethylsilyl)ethane ( P1 ), Scheme 1 , as the first step towards the fine-tuning of the catalyst for optimal activity. We assume in our model calculations that the Ru(II) cation is the active species, rather than the Ru(III) anion [RuCl 4 (NCCH 3 ) 2 ] \u2212 , since there are no Ru(III) complexes among all known Ru hydrosilylation catalysts (excluding RuCl 3 , which is not the active species itself). The Chalk\u2013Harrod [22] (CH) and modified Chalk\u2013Harrod [16,23\u201327] (mCH) catalytic cycles are the most common mechanisms in the literature for explaining the catalysis of the hydrosilylation reaction with late transition metal based compounds [8,13,14,17,28\u201333] . Both the CH and mCH mechanisms involve an initial oxidative addition of an SiH-functional silane to the transition metal, Ru (step I, Scheme 2 ). In the CH mechanism, this is followed by subsequent insertion of a C C functional substrate into the Ru\u2013H bond (step IIa), whereas in the mCH mechanism the C C bond is inserted into the Ru\u2013Si bond (step IIb). The final step (step III) for both mechanisms is the reductive elimination of the hydrosilylation product. An alternative to the Chalk\u2013Harrod scheme is the \u03c3-bond metathesis (SBM) mechanism [34,35] , which is well established for early transition metal catalysts [36\u201340] . More recently, it has also been shown to be active in a number of late transition metal catalysts as well [19,41\u201351] . Finally, in 2003, Glaser and Tilley proposed another mechanism for a cationic silylene Ru(II) catalyst in the hydrosilylation of alkenes [11] , and subsequent computational studies supported this proposal [10] . The Glaser\u2013Tilley (GT) mechanism ( Scheme 3 ) involves the insertion of the alkene directly into an Si\u2013H bond remote from the metal center (i.e. no direct interaction between the alkene and Ru). Given the cationic nature of our catalyst, this mechanism was also tested. 2 Experimental 2.1 General considerations The silanes diethoxymethylvinylsilane and diethoxymethylsilane were purchased from GELEST and used as received. The ruthenium catalyst [RuCl(NCCH 3 ) 5 ][RuCl 4 (NCCH 3 ) 2 ] was prepared by the method of Pitter et al. [20] . 1 H and 29 Si NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker Avance 300 spectrometer in CDCl 3 . All chemical shifts are in ppm referenced to the residual proton solvent resonance at \u03b4 7.24 ppm ( 1 H), or to the external standard TMS ( 29 Si). Routine GC analysis was performed with an AGILENT 6890 N gas chromatograph equipped with an RtX-200 column (Restek GmbH). Calibration was performed with pure samples of the silanes diethoxymethylvinylsilane, diethoxymethylsilane, and triethoxymethylsilane (purchased from GELEST) as well as bis(diethoxymethylsilyl)ethane, which was independently prepared by the literature method [52] . GC\u2013MS spectra were measured on an AGILENT 6890/MSD 5973 GC/mass spectrometer at 70 eV. 2.2 Catalytic run A 25 mL two-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser, argon inlet and a magnetic stirring bar was charged under argon with 17.1 mg (25.6 \u03bcmol) of [RuCl(NCCH 3 ) 5 ][RuCl 4 (NCCH 3 ) 2 ]. A 1.75 g (10.9 mmol) amount of Me(Vi)Si(OEt) 2 and 1.46 g (10.9 mmol) of Me(H)Si(OEt) 2 were added by syringe and the mixture was stirred and heated at 100 \u00b0C. The progress of the reaction was monitored by GC. After 2 h the starting SiH-functional silane was completely consumed. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was analyzed by GC and GC/MS. The crude mixture was purified by distillation leaving pure (EtO) 2 MeSi\u2013CH 2 CH 2 \u2013SiMe(OEt) 2 in a yield of 1.77 g (55%). The 1 H NMR data of (EtO) 2 MeSi\u2013CH 2 CH 2 \u2013SiMe(OEt) 2 compare well with the literature values [53] . 2.3 (EtO) 2 MeSi\u2013CH 2 CH 2 \u2013SiMe(OEt) 2 1 H NMR (300.1 MHz, CDCl 3 ) \u03b4 3.72 (q, 8H, J = 7.0 Hz, H 2 CO), 1.17 (t, 12H, J = 7.0 Hz, H 3 CCH 2 ), 0.54 (s, 4H, CH 2 CH 2 ), 0.07 (s, 6H, H 3 CSi). 29 Si NMR (59.6 MHz, CDCl 3 ) \u03b4 \u22124.42 (s). GC/MS: m / z (relative abundance): 279 (4%, M\u2212CH 3 ). 2.4 Reaction products The hydrosilylation of diethoxymethylvinylsilane with diethoxymethylsilane was performed at 100 \u00b0C in the presence of [RuCl(NCCH 3 ) 5 ][RuCl 4 (NCCH 3 ) 2 ] (0.0024 equiv.) without solvent monitoring the progress of the reaction via GC. After 2 h, no hydrosilane was detectable by GC. However, the formation of the hydrosilylation product (EtO) 2 MeSi\u2013CH 2 CH 2 \u2013SiMe(OEt) 2 (60% yield by GC) is accompanied by several by-products, especially MeSi(OEt) 3 (12%), presumably as a result of a H/OEt exchange reaction of diethoxymethylsilane. This would also explain that diethoxymethylvinylsilane is not fully consumed (7% left in the reaction mixture). The product distribution also contains 21% of unidentified compounds. However, it is noteworthy that the product of a dehydrogenative silylation, i.e. (EtO) 2 MeSi\u2013CH CH\u2013SiMe(OEt) 2 [54] is not formed, which implies that a \u03b2-hydrogen elimination reaction as side reaction path consecutively to step IIb in Scheme 2 (according to the modified Chalk\u2013Harrod mechanism) does not occur. This may also imply that the mCH mechanism is not valid for this catalyst (see below). 3 Computational methods Density functional theory (DFT) [55,56] was employed for the calculation of all reactants, transition states (TSs), intermediates and products. In all calculations, the ruthenium atom was described by a small-core, quasi-relativistic, effective core potential with the associated (7s6p5d)/[5s3p3d] valence basis set [57] , while the 6-31G(d,p) basis set [58\u201360] was used for all other atoms. Initial geometry optimizations of the minima along the reaction path were performed with the gradient-corrected BP86 functional [61\u201363] , in order to take advantage of the resolution-of-the-identity (RI)-DFT approach [64] , as implemented in turbomole [65\u201368] . All structures were subsequently refined in gaussian -03 [69] , by carrying out geometry optimizations with the B3LYP hybrid functional [61,63,70\u201373] , which has been shown to produce reliable thermochemical data for ruthenium-based compounds [74\u201376] . gaussian -03 was employed in the refinement process as the search for TSs often made use of the synchronous transit-guided quasi-Newton method [77,78] , available in this package. Frequency calculations were performed on all optimized structures, using the B3LYP functional, to characterize the stationary points as minima or TSs, as well as for the calculation of zero-point energies (ZPE), enthalpies ( H ), entropies ( S ), and Gibbs free enthalpies ( G ) at 298 K. 4 Results and discussion The addition of R1 to R2 in an uncatalyzed hydrosilylation reaction occurs in a concerted mechanism, with the H-abstraction from R1 and the Si\u2013C bond formation occurring concomitantly. In our previous study [19] , this reaction was found to have a prohibitively high barrier (\u0394 H act = 53.6 kcal/mol) and a catalyst is therefore needed to lower the activation enthalpy for the hydrosilylation to occur under normal operating conditions. 4.1 The catalyst The cation C1 is produced as an ion pair [20,21] \u2013 trans -[Ru II Cl(MeCN) 5 ][Ru III Cl 4 (MeCN) 2 ] \u2013 with a Ru(II) cation and a Ru(III) anion, from the reaction of RuCl 3 with dimethylphenylsilane in acetonitrile. As mentioned before, we only consider the Ru(II) cation C1 as catalyst for the hydrosilylation reaction. The optimized structure of C1 ( Fig. 1 ) is in good agreement with the available X-ray structure. The average Ru\u2013N bond length, cis to the Ru\u2013Cl bond, is 2.03 \u00c5, in excellent agreement with the reported X-ray structure value (2.03 \u00c5) [20] . The agreement between the computed and X-ray structure is equally good for the Ru\u2013Cl bond (2.40 \u00c5). The computed structure has a slightly elongated Ru\u2013N bond in trans position to the Cl ligand (2.06 \u00c5), consistent with the strong \u03c3-donor capabilities of the chloride ligand. In the X-ray structure (Ru\u2013N = 2.02 \u00c5) such an elongation was not observed. Nonetheless, the overall agreement between the computed and X-ray structure is excellent and indicates that the current level of theory is capable of adequately describing the cationic Ru(II) catalyst. 4.2 The induction period Generating the active form of C1 requires the dissociation of at least one of the six ligands in the octahedral complex. In the classic version of the CH or mCH mechanisms, two free coordination sites are required to bind the reaction partners. The dissociation enthalphy (\u0394 H d (298 K)) for removing two acetonitrile ligands is 70.5 kcal/mol, hence this process is prohibitive enthalpically ( Scheme 4 ). An alternative induction mechanism begins with the replacement of one of the acetonitrile ligands by R1, which yields the hexa-coordinated complex C4 ( Fig. 2 ). The direct substitution via the transition state TS ( C1 \u2013 C4 ) requires an activation of 23.5 kcal/mol and is thus enthalpically more favorable than the corresponding dissociation/association mechanism, which has an enthalpic cost of 31.2 kcal/mol for the initial dissociation C1 \u2192 C2 while the subsequent addition C2 + R1 \u2192 C4 is barrierless and exothermic. The complex C4 is destabilized by 13.4 kcal/mol relative to C1 . It can be transformed into a more active form ( C5 ) by a slightly exothermic \u03c3-bond metathesis reaction (\u0394 H = \u22122.3 kcal/mol), in which the Si\u2013H bond of R1 is replaced by the Si\u2013Cl bond, and the Ru\u2013Cl bond by the Ru\u2013H bond (via TS ( C4 \u2013 C5 ), \u0394 H act = 12.2 kcal/mol). The hexa-coordinated complex C5 can lose the chlorosilane ligand rather easily (\u0394 H = 8.9 kcal/mol) to form the penta-coordinated complex C7 (see below). Both C5 and C7 are thus enthalpically accessible and can serve as starting points for the catalytic cycle. In a recent study [19] of the same hydrosilylation reaction with the RuCl 2 (CO) 2 (PPh 3 ) 2 catalyst ( A1 ), the initial dissociation of a triphenylphosphine ligand was found to be much more facile, with an enthalpic cost of only 15.4 kcal/mol, i.e. about half of that required for removing an acetonitrile ligand from the current catalyst C1 . This difference is due to the electron-deficient Ru(II) environment created by the acetonitrile ligands in C1 . In the previous study [19] , the active form of the catalyst ( A16 ) was generated by a subsequent direct \u03c3-bond metathesis reaction between the dissociation product RuCl 2 (CO) 2 (PPh 3 ) ( A7 ) and R1 which required only very little activation (\u0394 H act = 1.9 kcal/mol) followed by a rearrangement of the resulting penta-coordinated complex RuHCl(CO) 2 (PPh 3 ) ( A8 ). The induction mechanisms for the previously and presently studied catalysts thus show some similarities: the active species C7 and A16 are analogous penta-coordinated complexes that contain a Ru\u2013H bond which is introduced by a chloride/hydride exchange through a \u03c3-bond metathesis reaction with R1 . However, there are also differences: in the present case, additional hexa-coordinated complexes ( C4 and C5 ) are encountered on the induction pathway, and in the initial induction step ( C1 \u2192 C4 ), a direct substitution is enthalpically favored because of the higher barrier to ligand dissociation. The induction is enthalpically less facile in the present case, since the largest single-step activation enthalpies are 15.4 and 23.5 kcal/mol for A1 and C1 , respectively, while the highest points on the corresponding enthalpy profiles are 17.3 and 25.6 kcal/mol, respectively. Under the normally applied experimental conditions, such barriers are surmountable in the induction phase. In the following, we address three possible catalytic mechanisms for our current catalyst: the CH and GT mechanisms starting from C5 , and an SBM mechanism starting from C7 . The role of entropic effects will be discussed thereafter. 4.3 Catalytic mechanisms The CH mechanism involves the insertion of an alkene into the metal-hydride bond followed by the product forming step where the metal\u2013silyl bond is broken ( Scheme 2 ). In C5 the alkene ( R2 ) is able to insert into the Ru\u2013H bond ( Fig. 3 ) to form C6 . However, a Ru\u2013Si bond does not exist in C5 , which excludes the mCH mechanism ( Scheme 2 ) for this active species. The optimized mCH intermediate, constructed from the four-coordinate Ru(II) complex, is 23.8 kcal/mol less stable than the analogous CH intermediate. Thus, the relative stability of the two intermediates also disfavors the possibility of an mCH mechanism for this catalyst. The insertion of R2 into C5 to form the CH intermediate is an exothermic reaction (\u0394 H ( C6 ) = \u22126.8 kcal/mol) but requires the surmounting of an extremely large barrier (\u0394 H act ( TS ( C5 \u2013 C6 )) = 56.7 kcal/mol). The high activation enthalpy for the olefin insertion process arises from the steric crowding around the metal center. The approaching olefin is not able to form a pre-complex with the metal before abstracting the hydride due to the saturation of the coordination sites in C5 ( Fig. 4 ). Consequently, the hydride abstraction precedes the formation of the Ru\u2013C bond in C6 , which is a highly unfavorable process given the electron deficient acetonitrile environment. This is in contrast to our findings on the RuCl 2 (CO) 2 (PPh 3 ) 2 catalyst where the metal center had been oxidized to a Ru(IV) state upon addition of the silane in the CH mechanism [19] . The abstraction of the hydride to form the CH intermediate therefore occurred with only a small barrier (6.7 kcal/mol), although, the final reductive elimination step excluded the CH mechanism for this catalyst as well [19] . In the current catalyst it is the barrier to forming the CH intermediate that excludes this mechanism as a viable pathway for the hydrosilylation reaction. Therefore, we did not invest time into obtaining the TS of the product forming step, although the reaction is again exothermic (\u0394 H ( C2 ) = \u22123.6 kcal/mol). The GT mechanism also requires a formal metal\u2013silyl bond in its original form [11] . Nonetheless, in C5 the hydride and silyl groups are well positioned to allow them to interact directly with R2 , even though there is no binding between R2 and the metal center in the GT-type TS ( Fig. 5 ). The simultaneous abstraction of both the silyl and hydride ligands leads directly to P1 and the active form of the catalyst, C2 . The addition of R1 to C2 occurs in a barrierless reaction (\u0394 H ( C4 ) = \u221217.8 kcal/mol) to generate C4 (see Fig. 2 ). However, the activation enthalpy for this reaction is 47.4 kcal/mol, which is clearly too high to explain the observed catalytic activity of this catalyst. Generally, silyl ligands have strong \u03c3-donor tendencies; in the GT mechanism ( Scheme 3 ) the electron donation to the metal centre is enhanced by forming a double bond to the metal center. This electron donation weakens the Si\u2013H bond, which allows the alkyl group to abstract the H-atom from Si and form a Si\u2013C bond. That is, by forming a double bond to the metal center the Si-atom is activated and consequently the barrier is lowered for the hydrosilylation reaction. In C3 the Si-atom has not been activated by Ru, rather the interaction between the Ru- and Si-atoms is very weak and the chlorosilane ligand is energetically stable. The barrier to the hydrosilylation reaction in this mechanism is therefore only slightly lower than in the uncatalyzed reaction (\u0394 H act = 53.6 kcal/mol) [19] . The CH and GT-type pathways discussed above provide helpful insights to the requirements that the actual mechanism must fulfill. To wit, an additional free coordination site is required to allow enough space around the metal center for the reactants to interact with Ru; and, at least R1 or R2 must directly bind to the metal center in order to lower the activation barrier. We have incorporated these features into a catalytic mechanism that is based on a series of SBM reactions ( Scheme 5 ). The active species in this mechanism is C7 ( Fig. 6 ) which is generated from C5 by the liberation of chlorosilane in an endothermic process (\u0394 H ( C7 ) = 8.9 kcal/mol). The olefin is able to bind to C7 in a barrierless, exothermic reaction to form C8 (\u0394 H ( C8 ) = \u221229.5 kcal/mol). The intramolecular H-transfer reaction to form C9 occurs with a low barrier (\u0394 H act ( TS ( C8 \u2013 C9 )) = 6.9 kcal/mol), however, the intermediate alkyl-ruthenium complex is produced in an endothermic reaction (\u0394 H ( C9 ) = 5.3 kcal/mol). The free coordination site in C9 is amenable to the attack of R1 , which stabilizes the complex by 2.4 kcal/mol via a dative bond involving its hydrogen atom ( C10 , Fig. 6 ) in an unhindered process. The last step in the catalytic cycle is the rate-determining step. The creation of the product occurs through a final SBM reaction where the H\u2013Si bond in C10 is replaced by the C\u2013Si bond in P1 and the Ru\u2013C bond is replaced by a Ru\u2013H bond as the active species, C7 , is reformed. This catalytic mechanism is analogous to that in the previously studied catalyst [19] . However, contrary to the induction period, the present catalyst is predicted to be more efficient in the catalytic cycle, particularly with regard to the rate-determining product formation step. The overall barrier in the catalytic cycle for the current catalyst (\u0394 H act = 16.0 kcal/mol, relative to C8 ), is significantly lower than that obtained for the RuCl 2 (CO) 2 (PPh 3 ) 2 catalyst (\u0394 H act = 21.8 kcal/mol) [19] , which reflects the activity ordering obtained experimentally for the two systems. The differences in the barrier heights during induction thus do not play a significant role in determining the catalytic ability of the two compounds \u2013 it is the product formation step in the catalytic cycle that is decisive. 4.4 Entropic effects Equilibria and reaction rates depend on the Gibbs free enthalpies, which differ from the reported relative enthalpies (\u0394 H ) through the inclusion of the entropic contributions (\u0394 G = \u0394 H \u2212 T \u0394 S ). These contributions have been calculated by applying the harmonic oscillator/rigid rotor approximation (see Supplementary material ); however, the results should be viewed with some caution, for two reasons. First, the computed entropic contributions refer to the gas phase and thus neglect solvation and desolvation effects in solution, which may be substantial. Second, the harmonic oscillator/rigid rotor approximation is known to be problematic in the case of weakly bound complexes (such as C4 and C10 ) due to the large number of low-energy vibrational modes, which in turn have large contributions to the entropy. Therefore, the following discussion focuses on how the computed enthalpy profile ( Fig. 7 ) is qualitatively affected by the entropic contributions. The main such effect is that association reactions suffer from an entropic penalty because of the loss of translational and rotational degrees of freedom (typically around 10 kcal/mol at 298 K in the gas phase), while dissociation reactions are entropically favored in an analogous manner. In solution, these entropic effects will be less pronounced than in the gas phase due to solvation and desolvation, but they will be present to some extent. In the induction phase ( Fig. 7 , black part) the direct substitution of acetonitrile ( C1 \u2192 C4 ) becomes less facile on the \u0394 G scale because of the entropic contributions associated with the loss of rotational and translational freedom when coordinating R1 (i.e. TS ( C1 \u2013 C4 ) is a seven coordinate complex). However, on the \u0394 G scale the dissociation of one of the acetonitrile ligands to form C2 becomes more favorable (\u0394 G ( C2 ) = 21.2 kcal/mol). The subsequent association of R1 remains as an unhindered process, although it is not as stabilizing on the \u0394 G scale due to the destabilizing entropic contribution ( C2 \u2192 C4 : \u0394 H = \u221217.8 kcal/mol, \u0394 G = \u22125.5 kcal/mol). Thus, the inclusion of entropic effects should lead to a change in the preferred mechanism for the formation of C4 from a direct mechanism ( C1 \u2192 C4 ), which is favored enthalpically, to a dissociation/association mechanism ( C1 \u2192 C2 \u2192 C4 ), which is more facile when free enthalpies are considered. The SBM reaction in the induction step ( C4 \u2192 C5 ) is not significantly affected by the inclusion of entropic effects (\u0394 H act = 12.2 kcal/mol, \u0394 G act = 14.8 kcal/mol) due to the intramolecular nature of the reaction. The dissociation of chlorosilane in the formation of C7 is favored from an entropic perspective ( C5 \u2192 C7 : \u0394 H = 8.9 kcal/mol, \u0394 G = \u22123.0 kcal/mol). On the \u0394 G scale, formation of C4 thus remains as the rate-determining step of the induction phase, and the five-coordinate intermediate ( C7 ), formed in the latter part of the reaction, is entropically favored. Considering the SBM catalytic cycle ( Fig. 7 , red part 1 For interpretation of the references to colour in Fig. 7 , the reader is referred to the web version of this article. 1 ) we first note that the overall reaction ( C7 + R1 + R2 \u2192 C7 + P1 ) combines two reactant molecules into one product molecule so that the entropic contributions must be positive, which is indeed found (\u0394 H = \u221229.0 kcal/mol, T\u0394 S = 12.9 kcal/mol, \u0394 G = \u221216.1 kcal/mol). Similarly, the intermediates in the SBM catalytic cycle ( C8 + R1 , C9 + R1 , C10 ) all have fewer molecules than the entry point ( C7 + R1 + R2 ). Therefore, in the \u0394 G profile of the catalytic cycle, all intermediates and the product are shifted upwards compared with the \u0394 H profile, but the other features remain qualitatively unchanged. In particular, the barrier to form the alkyl intermediate ( C9 ) remains similar on the \u0394 H and \u0394 G scales, and product formation remains as the rate-determining step. The qualitative conclusions drawn from the \u0394 H profile ( Fig. 7 ) thus remain valid also after considering entropic effects in the catalytic cycle. 5 Conclusions The comparison of the different reaction mechanisms involving C1 shows that the SBM mechanism provides the most favorable route to the hydrosilylation of R2 by R1 . The induction period of the catalyst involves the replacement of an acetonitrile ligand (either by a substitution reaction or a dissociation/association process) by R1 , followed by a SBM reaction that causes the exchange of the H-atom of R1 for the Cl-atom and introduces a hydride ligand on the metal center ( C5 ). In the induction phase, the direct substitution of an acetonitrile ligand by R1 has an activation enthalpy of 23.5 kcal/mol. The initial dissociation of an acetonitrile followed by the association of R1 to form C4 is more favorable from a free enthalpy perspective (\u0394 H act = 31.2 kcal/mol; \u0394 G act = 21.1 kcal/mol). Thus, either of these induction mechanisms are clearly favored over the spontaneous dissociation of two acetonitrile ligands due to the electron deficient environment of Ru(II). The subsequent dissociation of the chlorosilane to form C7 represents the starting point of the SBM catalytic mechanism. A stabilizing \u03b7 2 -coordination of R2 (\u221229.5 kcal/mol) in a barrierless reaction initiates the catalytic cycle, where the initial transformations ( C7 \u2192 C8 \u2192 C9 \u2192 C10 ) are facile. The final SBM step that generates the product ( C10 \u2192 C7 ) is rate-determining and the corresponding barrier of \u0394 H act = 13.1 kcal/mol (\u0394 G act = 22.5 kcal/mol) is consistent with the experimentally observed activity.

The catalytic mechanism of dichloro(p-cymene)ruthenium(II) (B1) is examined and compared to that of previously studied, less active catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) has been applied to explore the possibility of fine-tuning the catalytic ability of B1. The eta(6)-ligand and the sigma-donor ligands were varied to assess the steric and electronic factors that affect the reactivity of the catalyst. The catalytic ability is diminished by increasing the size of the eta(6)-ligand (p-cymene replaced by 1,3,5-cyclooctatriene) or the sigma-donor strength of the other ligands (chloride replaced by methyl). The original catalyst (B1) appears to strike an optimum balance with regard to the sigma-donor capabilities of the ligands as it is able to interconvert relatively freely between the Ru(II) and Ru(IV) oxidation states. All catalytically active compounds benefit from an initial exchange of one of the sigma-donor ligands for a hydride ligand in the induction step.",

        "abstract": "Past studies have shown that oxidation reactions by P450 Compound I (Cpd I) can be described by two competing quartet and doublet spin states, which possess three unpaired electrons, hence tri-radicals. One electron excitation from the delta orbital to sigma* xy generates two states that possess five unpaired electrons, so-called penta-radicals, in sextet and quartet situations, and which were shown by theory to lie only approximately 12-14 kcal/mol higher in energy than the tri-radical ground states (ref 7). The present study focuses on the C-H hydroxylation and C=C epoxidation of propene by these penta-radical states. It is shown that the initial energy differences, between the penta-radical and tri-radical states, diminish along the reaction pathway, due to the favorable and cumulative exchange stabilization of the more open-shell species. Furthermore, theory suggests that hydrogen bonding to the thiolate ligand, and general polarity of the environment, reduce these gaps further, thereby making the penta-radical states accessible to ground-state reactivity. The interconversion between the tri-radical and penta-radical states along the reaction coordinate will depend on the dynamics of spin-flips and energy barriers between the states. Especially interesting should be the region of the reaction intermediates; for both epoxidation and hydroxylation, this region is typified by a dense manifold of spin states and electromeric states (that differ by the oxidation state of iron), such that the total reactivity would be expected to reflect the interplay of these states, giving rise to multistate reactivity.",

        "abstract": "Proton transfer reactions play a vital role in the catalytic cycle of cytochrome P450cam and are responsible for the formation of the iron-oxo species called Compound I (Cpd I) that is supposed to be the active oxidant. Depending on the course of the proton transfer, protonation of the last observable intermediate (ferric hydroperoxo complex, Cpd 0) can lead to either the formation of Cpd I (coupling reaction) or the ferric resting state (uncoupling reaction). The ratio of these two processes is drastically affected by mutation of the Thr252 residue. In this work, we study the effect of Thr252X (X = serine, valine, alanine, glycine) mutations on the formation of Cpd I by means of hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations and classical simulations. In the wild-type enzyme, the coupling reaction is favored since its rate-limiting barrier is 13 kcal/mol lower than that for uncoupling. This difference is reduced to 7 kcal/mol in the serine mutant. In the case of valine, alanine, and glycine mutants, an additional water molecule enters the active site and lowers the activation energy of the uncoupling reaction significantly. With the additional water molecule, coupling and uncoupling have similar barriers in the valine mutant, and the uncoupling reaction becomes favored in the alanine and glycine mutants. These findings agree very well with experimental results and thus confirm the assumption that uncontrolled proton delivery by solvent water networks is responsible for the uncoupling reaction. The present study provides a detailed mechanistic understanding of the role of the Thr252 residue.",

        "abstract": "Protonation of Compound 0 in the catalytic cycle of cytochrome P450cam may lead to the formation of either the reactive Compound I (coupling) or the ferric resting state (uncoupling). In this work, we investigate the effect of the D251N mutation on the coupling and uncoupling reaction by combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations. The mutated Asn251 residue has two possible orientations, i.e. directed toward the active site (no flip) or away from the active site (flip), with the latter one being preferred in classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The possible proton transfer mechanisms in the coupling and uncoupling reaction were studied for three models of the D251N mutant, i.e. no flip (model I), flip (model II), and flip with an extra water (model III). According to the QM/MM calculations, the uncoupling reaction is always less favorable than the coupling reaction. The coupling reaction in the D251N mutant follows the same mechanism as in the wild-type enzyme, with initial O-O cleavage followed by proton transfer. The barrier for the initial step is similar in all D251N models, but the proton transfer is most facile in model III. The hydroxide anion formed in model III is not reprotonated easily by neighboring residues, while proton delivery from bulk solvent seems possible via a water network that remains intact during 2 ns classical MD simulation. The computational results are consistent with the experimental findings that the coupling reaction dominates the consumption of dioxygen in the D251N mutant, but with lower activity than in the wild-type enzyme.",

For each reaction, two possible mechanisms are studied, and for each of these the residues Asp251 and Glu366 are considered as proton sources.

The chosen 96-atom model includes the key functionalities deduced from experiment: Asp(251), Thr(252), Glu(366), and the water channels that relay the protons. The DFT model calculations show that (a) Cpd I is not formed spontaneously from Cpd 0 by direct protonation, nor is the process very exothermic. The process is virtually thermoneutral and involves a significant barrier such that formation of Cpd I is not facile on this route. (b) Along the protonation pathway, there exists an intermediate, a protonated Cpd 0, which is a potent oxidant since it is a ferric complex of water oxide. Preliminary quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical calculations confirm that Cpd 0 and Cpd I are of similar energy for the chosen model and that protonated Cpd 0 may exist as an unstable intermediate. The paper also addresses the essential role of Thr(252) as a hydrogen-bond acceptor (in accord with mutation studies of the OH group to OMe).",

However, since the Por(*)(+) species is a very good electron acceptor, other species, which can be either the ligand or side chain amino acid residues, may participate in electron donation to the Por(*)(+) moiety, thereby making Cpd I behave like a chemical chameleon. Thus, this behavior that was noted before for Cpd I of P450 is apparently much more wide ranging than initially appreciated. Since chemical chameleonic behavior property was found to be expressed not only in the properties of Cpd I itself, but also in its reactivity, the roots of this phenomenon are generalized.

Seven mechanistic variants were considered with different tautomeric forms of xanthine, different protonation states of the active-site residues, and different substrate orientations. The most favorable pathway (setup G) has a B3LYP/MM barrier of about 14 kcal mol(-1), consistent with the available experimental data. This multistep mechanism starts with Glu1261 deprotonating the xanthine at the N3 position followed by a proton transfer from the cofactor to the N9 atom of xanthine; the thus activated cofactor and substrate then react to form a tetrahedral intermediate, and a subsequent rate-limiting hydride transfer generates the product. The substrate orientation that has commonly been assumed in the literature leads to the most stable reactant complex, but the opposite orientation (\"upside down\") is computed to be the most favorable one during the reaction (setup G). In the \"upside down\" conformation, the Arg880 residue can best stabilize the reactive xanthine species with the negatively charged N3 atom, especially the tetrahedral intermediate and the following transition state for hydride transfer which is generally the highest point on the computed energy profiles. QM-only calculations for a minimal gas-phase model and for larger cluster models are performed for comparison, in particular for establishing intrinsic reactivities and a common energy scale. An analysis of the computational results provides detailed insight into the essential mechanistic role of the active-site residues.",

Replacement of the sulfido ligand in the natural cofactor by an oxo ligand leads to a substantial increase in the computed barriers, consistent with the experimentally observed inactivity of this modified cofactor, whereas the selenido form is predicted to have lower barriers and hence higher activity. For the substrate 2-oxo-6-methylpurine, the calculated pathways for three different tautomers show great similarity to those found previously for xanthine, contrary to claims in the literature that the mechanisms for these two substrates are different. Compared with the wild-type enzyme, the conversion of xanthine to uric acid follows a somewhat different pathway in the Glu802 --> Gln mutant which exhibits a lower overall activity, in agreement with recently published kinetic data. The present results confirm the basic stepwise reaction mechanism and the orientation of the substrate that has been proposed in our previous QM/MM work on aldehyde oxidoreductase and xanthine oxidase.",

Five possible pathways are explored concerning the binding mode of acetaldehyde and the catalytic effect of the nearby glutamic acid (Glu869), taking both possible protonation states into account. In the most favorable pathway, Glu869 participates and acts as a Lewis base to deprotonate the labile hydroxide group. This proton transfer is essential for the high activity of the enzyme toward substrate because it increases the nucleophilicity of the migrating O atom and strengthens the electrophilicity of the target C atom in the substrate. The subsequent product-forming reactions occur in two discrete steps, first nucleophilic attack and then hydride transfer, which implies that the oxidation of aldehyde is a two-electron process. A variant of this mechanism, with an additional water molecule bridging the Glu869 side chain and the substrate, has similar barriers. Judging from previous gas phase calculations and our present QM/MM data, the catalytic effect of Glu869 mainly lowers the barrier of the nucleophilic attack so that the hydride transfer becomes the rate-determining step in the reductive half-reaction.",

A combined experimental and computational study now provides a comprehensive mechanistic picture: a metallacyclopropene (\uf0682-vinyl complex) is primarily formed which either evolves into the E-alkene via a concerted process or reacts to give a half-sandwich ruthenium carbene; in this case, one of the C-atoms of the starting alkyne is converted into a methylene group. This transformation represents a formal gem-hydrogenation of a \uf070-bond, which has hardly any precedent. The barriers for trans-hydrogenation and gem-hydrogenation are similar: whereas DFT predicts a preference for trans-hydrogenation, CCSD(T) finds gem-hydrogenation slightly more facile. The carbene, once formed, will bind a second H2 molecule and evolve to the desired E-alkene, a positional alkene isomer or the corresponding alkane; this associative pathway explains why double bond isomerization and over-reduction compete with trans-hydrogenation. The computed scenario concurs with para-hydrogen induced polarization transfer (PHIP) NMR data, which confirm direct trans-delivery of H2, the formation of carbene intermediates by gem-hydrogenation, and their evolution into product and side products alike. Propargylic -OR (R = H, Me) groups exert a strong directing and stabilizing effect, such that several carbene intermediates could be isolated and characterized by X-ray diffraction. The gathered information spurred significant preparative advances: specifically, highly selective trans-hydrogenations of propargylic alcohols are reported, which are compatible with many other reducible functional groups. Moreover, the ability to generate metal carbenes by gem-hydrogenation paved the way for non-canonical hydrogenative cyclopropanations, ring expansions and cycloadditions.",

In this article, we present a comprehensive mechanistic investigation on this activation principle, which eventually led to its elucidation. Detailed studies are reported, including computational investigations on the supramolecular heterodimer, kinetic studies on the catalytic cycle, and a thorough analysis of transition states by DFT calculations for the rationalization of the catalyst structure\u2013selectivity relationship. On the basis of these investigations, we developed a kinetic resolution of racemic epoxides, which proceeds with high selectivity (up to s = 93), giving the unreacted epoxides and the corresponding protected 1,2-diols in high enantiopurity.

        "abstract": "The hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase and the Baeyer-Villiger reaction catalyzed by cyclohexanone monooxygenase are investigated by means of quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations at different levels of QM theory. The geometries of the stationary points along the reaction profile are obtained from QM/MM geometry optimizations, in which the QM region is treated by density functional theory (DFT). Relative energies are determined from single-point QM/MM calculations using the domain-based local pair natural orbital coupled cluster DLPNO-CCSD(T) method as QM component. The results are compared with single-point DFT/MM energies obtained using popular density functionals and with available experimental and computational data. It is found that the choice of the QM method strongly affects the computed energy profiles for these reactions. Different density functionals provide qualitatively different energy barriers (variations of the order of 10 kcal/mol in both reactions), thus limiting the confidence in DFT/MM computational predictions of energy profiles. On the other hand, the use of the DLPNO-CCSD(T) method in conjunction with large QM regions and basis sets makes it possible to achieve high accuracy. A critical discussion of all the technical aspects of the calculations is given with the aim of aiding computational chemists in the application of the DLPNO-CCSD(T) methodology in QM/MM calculations.",

        "abstract": "The extraction of polar molecules from aqueous solution is a challenging task in organic synthesis. 1-Butanol has been used sporadically as an eluent for polar molecules, but it is unclear which molecular features drive its efficiency. Here, we employ free energy simulations to study the partitioning of 15 solutes between water and 1-butanol. The simulations demonstrate that the high affinity of polar molecules to the wet 1-butanol phase is associated with its nanostructure. Small inverse micelles of water are able to accommodate polar solutes and locally mimic an aqueous environment. We verify the simulations based on partition coefficients between water and 1-octanol, and include a blind prediction of the water/1-butanol partition coefficient of cyclohexane-1,2-diol. The calculations are in excellent agreement with experiment, reaching root mean square deviations below 0.7 kcal/mol. Actual extractions of cyclohexane-1,2-diol from buffer solutions that mimic cell lysates and suspensions in biocatalytic reactions further exemplify our findings. The yields highlight that extractions with 1-butanol can be significantly more efficient than the conventional protocol based on ethyl acetate.",

We report an efficient implementation of the SF-XCIS method in the framework of semiempirical quantum chemistry that allows fast excited-state calculations for large systems. The performance of the SF-XCIS method in combination with semiempirical orthogonalization-corrected models (OMx) is statistically evaluated for vertical singlet excitation energies. The SF-XCIS method treats the ground state and excited states in a fully balanced manner and properly describes conical intersections involving the ground state. It can thus be used in fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) simulations of nonadiabatic dynamics processes. This is demonstrated in an OM2/SF-XCIS FSSH pilot study of excited-state proton transfer in 7-(2-pyridyl)indole.",

        "abstract": "Maintaining a proper balance between specific intermolecular interactions and non-specific solvent interactions is of critical importance in molecular simulations, especially when predicting binding affinities or reaction rates in the condensed phase. The most rigorous metric for characterizing solvent affinity are solvation free energies, which correspond to a transfer from the gas phase into solution. Due to the drastic change of the electrostatic environment during this process, it is also a stringent test of polarization response in the model. Here, we employ both the CHARMM fixed charge and polarizable force fields to predict hydration free energies of twelve simple solutes. The resulting classical ensembles are then reweighted to obtain QM/MM hydration free energies using a variety of QM methods, including MP2, Hartree\u207bFock, density functional methods (BLYP, B3LYP, M06-2X) and semi-empirical methods (OM2 and AM1 ). Our simulations test the compatibility of quantum-mechanical methods with molecular-mechanical water models and solute Lennard\u207bJones parameters. In all cases, the resulting QM/MM hydration free energies were inferior to purely classical results, with the QM/MM Drude force field predictions being only marginally better than the QM/MM fixed charge results. In addition, the QM/MM results for different quantum methods are highly divergent, with almost inverted trends for polarizable and fixed charge water models. While this does not necessarily imply deficiencies in the QM models themselves, it underscores the need to develop consistent and balanced QM/MM interactions. Both the QM and the MM component of a QM/MM simulation have to match, in order to avoid artifacts due to biased solute\u207bsolvent interactions. Finally, we discuss strategies to improve the convergence and efficiency of multi-scale free energy simulations by automatically adapting the molecular-mechanics force field to the target quantum method.",

        "abstract": "We present a computationally derived energy transfer model for the peridinin-chlorophyll a-protein (PCP), which invokes vibrational relaxation in the two lowest singlet excited states rather than internal conversion between them. The model allows an understanding of the photoinduced processes without assuming further electronic states or a dependence of the 2Ag state character on the vibrational sub-state. We report molecular dynamics simulations (CHARMM22 force field) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations on PCP. In the latter, the QM region containing a single peridinin (Per) chromophore or a Per-Chl a (chlorophyll a) pair is treated by density functional theory (DFT, CAM-B3LYP) for geometries and by DFT-based multireference configuration interaction (DFT/MRCI) for excitation energies. The calculations show that Per has a bright, green light absorbing 2Ag state, in addition to the blue light absorbing 1Bu state found in other carotenoids. Both states undergo a strong energy lowering upon relaxation, leading to emission in the red, while absorbing in the blue or green. The orientation of their transition dipole moments indicates that both states are capable of excited-state energy transfer to Chl a, without preference for either 1Bu or 2Ag as donor state. We propose that the commonly postulated partial intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character of a donating Per state can be assigned to the relaxed 1Bu state, which takes on ICT character. By assuming that both 1Bu and 2Ag are able to donate to the Chl a Q band, one can explain why different chlorophyll species in PCP exhibit different acceptor capabilities. ",

Various approximations of the free-energy perturbation method were tested. We find that it is adequate not only to freeze the density of the QM part during the dynamics at frozen QM geometry but also to approximate this density by electrostatic-potential-fitted point charges. It is advisable to include all atoms of a QM/MM link in the perturbation. The results of QM/MM-FEP for PHBH are in good agreement with those of thermodynamic integration and umbrella sampling. ",

        "abstract": "We present a microiterative adiabatic scheme for quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) energy minimization that fully optimizes the MM part in each QM macroiteration. This scheme is applicable not only to mechanical embedding but also to electrostatic and polarized embedding. The electrostatic QM/MM interactions in the microiterations are calculated from electrostatic potential charges fitted on the fly to the QM density. Corrections to the energy and gradient expressions ensure that macro- and microiterations are performed on the same energy surface. This results in excellent convergence properties and no loss of accuracy compared to standard optimization. We test our implementation on water clusters and on two enzymes using electrostatic embedding, as well as on a surface example using polarized embedding with a shell model. Our scheme is especially well-suited for systems containing large MM regions, since the computational effort for the optimization is almost independent of the MM system size. The microiterations reduce the number of required QM calculations typically by a factor of 2-10, depending on the system. ",

        "abstract": "Most modern semiempirical quantum-chemical (SQC) methods are based on the neglect of diatomic differential overlap (NDDO) approximation to ab initio molecular integrals. Here, we check the validity of this approximation by computing all relevant integrals for 32 typical organic molecules using Gaussian-type orbitals and various basis sets (from valence-only minimal to all-electron triple-\u03b6 basis sets) covering in total more than 15.6 million one-electron (1-e) and 10.3 billion two-electron (2-e) integrals. The integrals are calculated in the nonorthogonal atomic basis and then transformed by symmetric orthogonalization to the L\u00f6wdin basis. In the case of the 1-e integrals, we find strong orthogonalization effects that need to be included in SQC models, for example, by strategies such as those adopted in the available OMx methods. For the valence-only minimal basis, we confirm that the 2-e Coulomb integrals in the L\u00f6wdin basis are quantitatively close to their counterparts in the atomic basis and that the 2-e exchange integrals can be safely neglected in line with the NDDO approximation. For larger all-electron basis sets, there are strong multishell orthogonalization effects that lead to more irregular patterns in the transformed 2-e integrals and thus cast doubt on the validity of the NDDO approximation for extended basis sets. Focusing on the valence-only minimal basis, we find that some of the NDDO-neglected integrals are reduced but remain sizable after the transformation to the L\u00f6wdin basis; this is true for the two-center 2-e hybrid integrals, the three-center 1-e nuclear attraction integrals, and the corresponding three-center 2-e hybrid integrals. We consider a scheme with a valence-only minimal basis that includes such terms as a possible strategy to go beyond the NDDO integral approximation in attempts to improve SQC methods. \u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "In this work we employ simple model systems to evaluate the relative performance of two of the most important free energy methods: The Zwanzig equation (also known as \"Free energy perturbation\") and Bennett's acceptance ratio method (BAR). Although our examples should be transferable to other kinds of free energy simulations, we focus on applications of multi-scale free energy simulations. Such calculations are especially complex, since they connect two different levels of theory with very different requirements in terms of speed, accuracy, sampling and parallelizability. We try to reconcile all those different factors by developing some simple criteria to guide the early stages of the development of a free energy protocol. This is accomplished by quantifying how many \u03bb intermediate steps and how many potential energy evaluations are necessary in order to reach a certain level of convergence.",

Strong indications for a HAT mechanism were derived by using different para-substituted N-aryl tetrahydroisoquinolines, showing that electronic effects play a minor role in the reaction. Hammett plots of the Cu-catalyzed reaction, a direct time-resolved kinetic study with in situ generated cumyloxyl radicals, as well as density functional calculations gave essentially the same results. We conclude from these results and from kinetic isotope effect experiments that HAT is mostly mediated by tert-butoxyl radicals and only to a lesser extent by tert-butylperoxyl radicals, in contrast to common assumptions. However, reaction conditions affect the competition between these two pathways, which can significantly change the magnitude of kinetic isotope ef...",

        "abstract": "Cryptochrome (CRY) is the principal light sensor of the insect circadian clock. Photoreduction of the  Drosophila  CRY (dCRY) flavin cofactor to the anionic semiquinone (ASQ) restructures a C-terminal tail helix (CTT) that otherwise inhibits interactions with targets that include the clock protein Timeless (TIM). All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicate that flavin reduction destabilizes the CTT, which undergoes large-scale conformational changes (the CTT release) on short (25 ns) timescales. The CTT release correlates with the conformation and protonation state of conserved His378, which resides between the CTT and the flavin cofactor. Poisson-Boltzmann calculations indicate that flavin reduction substantially increases the His378 p K  a . Consistent with coupling between ASQ formation and His378 protonation, dCRY displays reduced photoreduction rates with increasing pH; however, His378Asn/Arg variants show no such pH dependence. Replica-exchange MD simulations also support CTT release mediated by changes in His378 hydrogen bonding and verify other responsive regions of the protein previously identified by proteolytic sensitivity assays. His378 dCRY variants show varying abilities to light-activate TIM and undergo self-degradation in cellular assays. Surprisingly, His378Arg/Lys variants do not degrade in light despite maintaining reactivity toward TIM, thereby implicating different conformational responses in these two functions. Thus, the dCRY photosensory mechanism involves flavin photoreduction coupled to protonation of His378, whose perturbed hydrogen-bonding pattern alters the CTT and surrounding regions.",

Two chiral S1/S0 conical intersections with associated enantiomeric S1 relaxation paths that are barrierless and efficient (timescale of ca. 50\u2005fs) were found. For the parent arylazopyrazole (Z8) both paths contribute evenly to the S1 excited-state decay, whereas for the dimethyl derivative (Z11) each of the two chiral cis minima decays almost exclusively through one specific enantiomeric S1 relaxation path. To our knowledge, the Z11 arylazopyrazole is thus the first example for nearly stereospecific unidirectional excited-state relaxation.",

The reaction is a two-step process. The initial step is the formation of a reactive acyl enzyme (AcCalB) via a tetrahedral intermediate (TI-1). The stereoselectivity originates from the second step, when AcCalB reacts with the racemic substrate via a second tetrahedral intermediate (TI-2). Reaction barriers for the conversion of (R)- and (S)-propranolol to O-acetylpropranolol were computed for several distinct conformations of TI-2. In QM/MM geometry optimizations and reaction path calculations the QM region was described by density functional theory (B3LYP/TZVP) and the MM region by the CHARMM force field.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Urocanic acid (UA) is a UV filter found in human skin, which has been linked to photoimmunosuppression and the formation of skin cancer. Its UV-light-induced photoisomerization and radiationless deactivation mechanisms have been addressed previously by static calculations. In this paper, we present nonadiabatic trajectory-surface-hopping dynamics simulations of photoexcited UA using the semiempirical OM2/MRCI methodology and an adaptive-timestep algorithm. We have simulated almost 6000 trajectories, each for a simulation time of 1.6\u202fps, covering the entire conformational space of the  E  and  Z  isomers of both possible tautomers of the isolated neutral form of UA (overall 32 conformers). Initial conditions for the excited-state dynamics were obtained from 1\u202fns ground-state dynamics simulations. We find that UA has an ultrashort excited-state lifetime, which is due to ultrafast radiationless excited-state deactivation driven by     E  \u2194  Z     photoisomerization and excited-state intramolecular proton-transfer (ESIPT) processes. The computed S 1  excited-state lifetimes for the  E  and  Z  isomers of the N1H and N3H tautomers range from 271 to 506\u202ffs. The photoisomerization quantum yield is calculated to be 43% (32%) for the combined  E  ( Z ) isomers of both tautomers. The shorter lifetime and the lower photoisomerization quantum yield of the  Z  isomers can be rationalized by the larger number of available excited-state deactivation processes: the  Z  isomers can undergo ESIPT and photoisomerization, whereas the  E  isomers can only deactivate via the latter process. The intramolecular hydrogen bond that is present in many  Z  conformers can prevent successful photoisomerization to an  E  isomer. We find no evidence for an excitation-energy-dependent quantum yield for photoisomerization (EEDQY-PI) in isolated ( E )-UA, which has previously been detected spectroscopically in aqueous solution. However, we do find an EEDQY-PI as well as a complementary excitation-energy-dependent quantum yield for ESIPT (EEDQY-ESIPT) for the N1H- Z  isomers, which demonstrates the competition of the photoisomerization and ESIPT processes. The present comprehensive study lays the groundwork for future photodynamics simulations of UA in the aqueous phase.",

        "title": "QM/MM study of the taxadiene synthase mechanism.",
        "abstract": "Combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations were used to investigate the reaction mechanism of taxadiene synthase (TXS). TXS catalyzes the cyclization of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) to taxadiene (T) and four minor cyclic products. All these products originate from the deprotonation of carbocation intermediates. The reaction profiles for the conversion of GGPP to T as well as to minor products were calculated for different configurations of relevant TXS carbocation complexes. The QM region was treated at the M06-2X/TZVP level, while the CHARMM27 force field was used to describe the MM region. The QM/MM calculations suggest a reaction pathway for the conversion of GGPP to T, which slightly differs from previous proposals regarding the number of reaction steps and the conformation of the carbocations. The QM/MM results also indicate that the formation of minor products via water-assisted deprotonation of the carbocations is highly exothermic, by about -7 to -23\u2009kcal/mol. Curiously, however, the computed barriers and reaction energies indicate that the formation of some of the minor products is more facile than the formation of T. Thus, the present QM/MM calculations provide detailed insights into possible reaction pathways and into the origin of the promiscuity of TXS, but they do not reproduce the product distribution observed experimentally. \u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to rationalize these findings.

        "abstract": "There is a long-standing mechanistic consensus that alcohol oxidation by Cytochrome P450 enzymes is triggered by hydrogen abstraction from the \u03b1-C-H bond of the alcohol. Through combined MD simulations and QM/MM calculations we demonstrate that this is not the case in P450 2E1-mediated ethanol oxidation. We show that while the O-H bond is stronger than the \u03b1-C-H bonds in alcohols, the intrinsic reactivity of O-H and \u03b1-C-H bonds is comparable for hydrogen abstraction, due to the strong electrostatic interaction between the ethanol hydroxyl group and the Fe=O moiety. Thus, the binding of ethanol to the Fe=O moiety in the P450 2E1 pocket is of particular importance to the reaction mechanism. We further show that the Thr303 residue plays a crucial role in confining the ethanol substrate in the active site of P450 2E1 and thereby steering the first hydrogen abstraction from the O-H bond of ethanol. Because of the highly endothermic O-H bond cleavage, the second hydrogen abstraction of \u03b1-C-H bond is the overall...",

        "abstract": "In a previous combined QM/MM molecular dynamics (MD) study from our laboratory on the identity SN2 reaction between a chloride anion and an amino chloride in liquid dimethyl ether (DME), an increase in the free energy activation barrier was observed in the condensed phase when compared to the gas-phase activation energy. Here we reproduce these findings, but when comparing the condensed-phase potential of mean force (PMF) with the free energy profile in the gas phase (obtained from Monte Carlo simulations), we observe a smaller solvent effect on the activation barrier of the reaction. In a next step, we introduce an explicit description of electronic polarization in the MM (solvent) part of the system. A polarizable force field for liquid DME was developed based on the charge-on-spring (COS) model, which was calibrated to reproduce thermodynamic properties of the nonpolarizable model in classical MD simulations. The COS model was implemented into the MNDO/GROMOS interface in a special version of the QM/MM software ChemShell, which was used to investigate the effect of solvent polarization on the free energy profile of the reaction under study. A higher activation barrier was obtained using the polarizable solvent model than with the nonpolarizable force field, due to a better solvation of and a stronger polarization of solvent molecules around the separate reactants. The obtained PMFs were subjected to an energy-entropy decomposition of the relative solvation free energies of the reactant complex along the reaction coordinate, to investigate in a quantitative manner whether the solvent (polarization) effects are mainly due to favorable QM-MM (energetic) interactions.",

Experimentally, the reaction is known to proceed through the triplet state. We have located all relevant S0 and T1 minima and transition states, as well as the T1/S0 crossing points, and mapped eight stepwise photocyclization pathways for four different conformers in the T1 state that lead to distinct regioisomers. In the preferred four pathways (one for each conformer) the initially formed C-C bond involves the terminal carbon atom of the alkene moiety. This regioselectivity originates from electrostatic preferences (arising from the charge distribution in the polarized C[double bond, length as m-dash]C double bonds) and from the different thermodynamic stability of the resulting triplet diradical intermediates (caused by electron donation effects that stabilize the radical centers). The formation of the second C-C bond is blocked in the T1 state by prohibitively high barriers and thus occurs after intersystem crossing to the ground state. Furthermore, we rationalize substitution effects on enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity and identify their origin. ",

We report combined electronic structure calculations and nonadiabatic dynamics simulations to study the excited-state decay mechanisms of two TPE derivatives with four methyl substituents, either in the meta position (TPE-4mM, \u03d5 = 0.1%) or in the ortho position (TPE-4oM, \u03d5 = 64.3%). In both cases, two excited-state decay pathways may be relevant, namely, photoisomerization around the central ethylenic double bond and photocyclization involving two adjacent phenyl rings. In TPE-4mM, the barrierless S cyclization is favored; it is responsible for the ultralow fluorescence quantum yield observed experimentally. In TPE-4oM, both the S photocyclization and photoisomerization paths are blocked by non-negligible barriers, and fluorescence is thus feasible. Nonadiabatic dynamics simulations with more than 1000 surface hopping trajectories show ultrafast cyclization upon photoexcitation of TPE-4mM, whereas TPE-4oM remains unreactive during the 1 ps simulations. We discuss the chances for spectroscopic detection of the postulated cyclic photoproduct of TPE-4mM and the relevance of our findings for the AIE process.",

Herein we have employed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods to explore the photoisomerization dynamics of an azobenzene-tethered DNA duplex. We find that in the S\u2081 state the trans-cis photoisomerization path is much steeper in DNA than in vacuo, which makes the photoisomerization much faster in the DNA environment. This acceleration is primarily caused by complex steric interactions between azobenzene and the nearby unpaired thymine nucleobase, which also change the photoisomerization mechanism of azobenzene in the DNA duplex.",

        "abstract": "Motivated by its potential use as a photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy, we report the first ab initio quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) study of 4-thiothymidine in aqueous solution. The core chromophore 4-thiothymine was described using the multiconfigurational CASSCF and CASPT2 QM methods, while the ribose and the solvent water molecules were treated at the MM level (CHARMM and TIP3P, respectively). The minima of the five lowest electronic states (S0, S1, S2, T1, and T2) and six minimum-energy intersections were fully optimized at the QM(CASSCF)/MM level, and their energies were further refined by single-point QM(CASPT2)/MM and CASPT2 calculations. The relevant spin-orbit couplings were also computed. We find that (1) there are three efficient photophysical pathways that account for the experimentally observed ultrafast formation of the lowest triplet state with a quantum yield of nearly unity, (2) the striking qualitative differences in the photophysical behavior of 4-thiothymine and thymine originate from the different electronic structure of their S1 states, and (3) environmental effects play an important role. The present QM/MM calculations provide mechanistic insight that may guide the design of improved photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy. ",

        "abstract": "A recent experimental study reported a visible-light-mediated aerobic oxidative coupling reaction of phenol with alkynes that produces hydroxyl-functionalized aryl ketones using inexpensive CuCl as catalyst under mild conditions. Here we apply the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) method and multistate second-order perturbation (MS-CASPT2) theory in combination with density functional theory (DFT) to systematically explore the entire photocatalytic reaction between phenol and phenylacetylene in acetonitrile solution in the presence of molecular oxygen and CuCl. Our main findings are as follows: (1) The visible-light-driven conversion of phenylacetylene to PhCCCu(I) occurs thermally because of efficient excited-state deactivation to the S state. (2) The single electron transfer from PhCCCu(I) to molecular oxygen that leads to the PhCCCu(II) cation takes place in the T state after an efficient S \u2192 T intersystem crossing. (3) During the initial oxidation of phenol, molecular oxygen prefers to attack the para position of the phenol radical intermediate to produce 1,4-benzoquinone, which further reacts with PhCCCu(II) to generate para-hydroxyl-substituted aryl ketones; this is the origin of the experimentally observed regioselectivity. (4) The C\u2261C bond of the phenylacetylene moiety is not activated by the triplet-state single electron transfer from PhCCCu(I) to molecular oxygen but is cleaved at a later stage, in the [2+2] cycloaddition between PhCCCu(II) and 1,4-benzoquinone. (5) The substrate phenol plays an active role in several hydrogen transfer and decarboxylation reactions; the barriers to these phenol-assisted reactions are lower than those for the corresponding direct or water-assisted reactions, which explains the experimental finding that adding water does not enhance the photocatalytic reaction yield. In summary, while supporting the general features of the experimentally proposed mechanism, our computational study provides detailed mechanistic insights that should be useful for understanding and further improving visible-light-induced copper-catalyzed coupling reactions.",

Experimental and computational data now prove that the alkyne primarily acts as a four-electron donor ligand to the catalytically active metal fragment [Cp*RuCl] but switches to adopt a two-electron donor character once the reagent R3MH (M = Si, Ge, Sn) enters the ligand sphere. In the stereodetermining step the resulting loaded complex evolves via an inner-sphere mechanism into a ruthenacyclopropene which swiftly transforms into the product. In accord with the low computed barriers, spectral and preparative data show that the reaction is not only possible but sometimes even favored at low temperatures. Importantly, such trans-hydrometalations are distinguished by excellent levels of regioselectivity when unsymmetrical alkynes are used that carry an \u2212OH or \u2212NHR group in vicinity of the triple bond.

        "abstract": "The mechanism of color tuning in the rhodopsin family of proteins has been studied by comparing the optical properties of the light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin (bR) and the light detector sensory rhodopsin II (sRII). Despite a high structural similarity, the maximal absorption is blue-shifted from 568 nm in bR to 497 nm in sRII. The molecular mechanism of this shift is still a matter of debate, and its clarification sheds light onto the general mechanisms of color tuning in retinal proteins. The calculations employ a combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) technique, using a DFT-based method for ground state properties and the semiempirical OM2/MRCI method and ab initio SORCI method for excited state calculations. The high efficiency of the methodology has allowed us to study a wide variety of aspects including dynamical effects. The absorption shift as well as various mutation experiments and vibrational properties have been successfully reproduced. Our results indicate that several sources contribute to the spectral shift between bR and sRII. The main factors are the counterion region at the extracellular side of retinal and the amino acid composition of the binding pocket. Our analysis allows a distinction and identification of the different effects in detail and leads to a clear picture of the mechanism of color tuning, which is in good agreement with available experimental data.",

        "abstract": "Exciton dynamics governs energy transfer and charge generation in organic functional materials. We investigate high-energy nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics for a bithiophene dimer to describe time-dependent excitonic effects in molecular aggregates. We show that the lowest excited states are populated on the subpicosecond time scale. These states are localized and unproductive in terms of charge separation. Productive high-energy charge-transfer (CT) states are populated within 50 fs during exciton deactivation, but they are short-lived (\u223c100 fs) and quickly transfer their population to lower states. Our simulations offer molecular-level insights into ultrafast photoinduced charge separation potentially triggered by hot CT states in solid-state organic materials. Design rules are suggested to increase hot exciton lifetimes, favoring the population of CT states as gateways for direct charge generation. These rules may boost the CT quantum yield by depleting unproductive recombination channels.",

        "abstract": "The C-F bond-forming step in the fluorinase, the only native fluorination enzyme characterized to date, has been studied. The enzyme catalyzes the reaction between S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and fluoride ions to form 5'-fluoro-5'-deoxyadenosine (5'-FDA) and L-methionine. To obtain an insight into the mechanism of this unusual enzymatic reaction and to elucidate the role of the enzyme in catalysis, we have explored the conformational energetics of SAM and the intrinsic reactivity patterns of SAM and fluoride with DFT (BP86) and continuum solvent methods, before investigating the full enzymatic system with combined DFT/CHARMM calculations. We find that the enzymatic reaction follows an S(N)2 reaction mechanism, concurring with the intrinsic reactivity preferences in solution. The formation of sulfur ylides is thermodynamically strongly disfavored, and an alternative elimination-addition mechanism involving the concerted anti-Markovnikov addition of HF to an enol ether is energetically viable, but kinetically prohibitive. The S(N)2 activation energy is 92 (112) kJ mol(-)(1) in solution, but only 53 (63) kJ mol(-1) in the enzyme, and the reaction energy in the enzyme is -25 (-34) kJ mol(-1) (values in parentheses are B3LYP single-point energies). The fluorinase thus lowers the barrier for C-F bond formation by 39 (49) kJ mol(-)(1). A decomposition analysis shows that the major role of the enzyme is in the preparation and positioning of the substrates.",

        "abstract": "Light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domains sense blue light through the photochemical formation of a cysteinyl-flavin covalent adduct. Concurrent protonation at the flavin N5 position alters the hydrogen bonding interactions of an invariant Gln residue that has been proposed to flip its amide side chain as a critical step in the propagation of conformational change. Traditional molecular dynamics (MD) and replica-exchange MD (REMD) simulations of the well-characterized LOV protein Vivid (VVD) demonstrate that the Gln182 amide indeed reorients by \u223c180\u00b0 in response to either adduct formation or reduction of the isoalloxazine ring to the neutral semiquinone, both of which involve N5 protonation. Free energy simulations reveal that the relative free energies of the flipped Gln conformation and the flipping barrier are significantly lower in the light-adapted state. The Gln182 flip stabilizes an important hinge-b\u03b2 region between the PAS \u03b2-sheet and the N-terminal cap helix that in turn destabilizes an N-terminal latch region against the PAS core. Release of the latch, observed both experimentally and in the simulations, is known to mediate light-induced VVD dimerization. This computational study of a LOV protein, unprecedented in its agreement with experiment, provides an atomistic view of long-range allosteric coupling in a photoreceptor.",

Evaluation of their reactivity toward different metal centers provides evidence that the dicationic fragment, otherwise reluctant to coordinate metals, readily participates in the formation of chelates when embedded into such a scaffold. Moreover, it significantly enhances the Lewis acidity of the metals to which it coordinates. This property has been used to develop a Rh catalyst that efficiently triggers the hydroarylation of dienes with electron-rich aromatic molecules. Kinetic studies and deuterium-labeling experiments, as well as density functional theory calculations, were performed in order to rationalize these findings.",

Steepest descent, conjugate gradient, quasi-Newton, and L-BFGS algorithms as well as damped molecular dynamics are available as minimization methods. The partitioned rational function optimization algorithm, a modified version of the dimer method and the nudged elastic band approach provide capabilities for transition-state search. Penalty function, gradient projection, and Lagrange-Newton methods are implemented for conical intersection optimizations. Various stochastic search methods, including a genetic algorithm, are available for global or local minimization and can be run as parallel algorithms. The code is released under the open-source GNU LGPL license. Some selected applications of DL-FIND are surveyed.",

Catalyzed by the chiral phosphoric acid STRIP, good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities could be obtained. Remarkably, biological evaluation reveals one of these novel 2H-pyrroles to be a potent but nontoxic inhibitor of the Hedgehog signaling pathway by binding to the Smoothened protein.",

        "title": "Solvent Boundary Potentials for Hybrid QM/MM Computations Using Classical Drude Oscillators: A Fully Polarizable Model",
        "abstract": "Accurate quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) treatments should account for MM polarization and properly include long-range electrostatic interactions. We report on a development that covers both these aspects. Our approach combines the classical Drude oscillator (DO) model for the electronic polarizability of the MM atoms with the generalized solvent boundary Potential (GSBP) and the solvated macromolecule boundary potential (SMBP). These boundary potentials (BP) are designed to capture the long-range effects of the outer region of a large system on its interior. They employ a finite difference approximation to the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for computing electrostatic interactions and take into account outer-region bulk solvent through a polarizable dielectric continuum (PDC). This approach thus leads to fully polarizable three-layer QM/MM-DO/BP methods. As the mutual responses of each of the subsystems have to be taken into account, we propose efficient schemes to converge the polarization of each layer simultaneously. For molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using GSBP, this is achieved by considering the MM polarizable model as a dynamical degree of freedom, and hence contributions from the boundary potential can be evaluated for a frozen state of polarization at every time step. For geometry optimizations using SMBP, we propose a dual self-consistent field approach for relaxing the Drude oscillators to their ideal positions and converging the QM wave function with the proper boundary potential. The chosen coupling schemes are evaluated with a test system consisting of a glycine molecule in a water ball. Both boundary potentials are capable of properly reproducing the gradients at the inner-region atoms and the Drude oscillators. We show that the effect of the Drude oscillators must be included in all terms of the boundary potentials to obtain accurate results and that the use of a high dielectric constant for the PDC does not lead to a polarization catastrophe of the DO models. Optimum values for some key parameters are discussed. We also address the efficiency of these approaches compared to standard QM/MM-DO calculations without BP. In the SMBP case, computation times can be reduced by around 40% for each step of a geometry optimization, with some variation depending on the chosen QM method. In the GSBP case, the computational advantages of using the boundary potential increase with system size and with the number of MD steps. ",

        "abstract": "We present a hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics/coarse-grained (QM/MM/CG) multiresolution approach for solvated biomolecular systems. The chemically important active-site region is treated at the QM level. The biomolecular environment is described by an atomistic MM force field, and the solvent is modeled with the CG Martini force field using standard or polarizable (pol-CG) water. Interactions within the QM, MM, and CG regions, and between the QM and MM regions, are treated in the usual manner, whereas the CG-MM and CG-QM interactions are evaluated using the virtual sites approach. The accuracy and efficiency of our implementation is tested for two enzymes, chorismate mutase (CM) and p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (PHBH). In CM, the QM/MM/CG potential energy scans along the reaction coordinate yield reaction energies that are too large, both for the standard and polarizable Martini CG water models, which can be attributed to adverse effects of using large CG water beads. The inclusion of an atomistic MM water layer (10 \u00c5 for uncharged CG water and 5 \u00c5 for polarizable CG water) around the QM region improves the energy profiles compared to the reference QM/MM calculations. In analogous QM/MM/CG calculations on PHBH, the use of the pol-CG description for the outer water does not affect the stabilization of the highly charged FADHOOH-pOHB transition state compared to the fully atomistic QM/MM calculations. Detailed performance analysis in a glycine-water model system indicates that computation times for QM energy and gradient evaluations at the density functional level are typically reduced by 40-70% for QM/MM/CG relative to fully atomistic QM/MM calculations.",

In this article, we address several technical aspects in the development of polarizable QM/MM embedding using the Drude Oscillator (DO) force field. We propose a stable and converging update of the DO polarization state for geometry optimizations and a suitable treatment of the QM/MM-DO boundary when the QM and MM regions are separated by cutting through a covalent bond. We assess the performance of our approach by computing binding energies and geometries of three selected complexes relevant to biomolecular modeling, namely the water trimer, the N-methylacetamide dimer, and the cationic bis(benzene)sodium sandwich complex. Using a recently published MM-DO force field for proteins, we evaluate the effect of MM polarization on the QM/MM energy profiles of the enzymatic reactions catalyzed by chorismate mutase and by p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase. We find that inclusion of MM polarization affects the computed barriers by about 10%. ",

Phys. 2001, 114, 2924 ] in the framework of semiempirical hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods. Application of the GSBP is connected with a significant overhead that is dominated by numerical solutions of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for continuous charge distributions. Three approaches are presented that accelerate computation of the values at the boundary of the simulation box and in the interior of the macromolecule and solvent. It is shown that these methods reduce the computational overhead of the GSBP significantly with only minimal loss of accuracy. The accuracy of the GSBP to represent long-range electrostatic interactions is assessed for an extensive set of its inherent parameters, and a set of optimal parameters is defined. On this basis, the overhead and the savings of the GSBP are quantified for model systems of different sizes in the range of 7000 to 40\u2009000 atoms. We find that the savings compensate for the overhead in systems larger than 12\u2009500 atoms. Beyond this system size, the GSBP reduces the computational cost significantly, by 70% and more for large systems (>25\u2009000 atoms). ",

The SMBP targets QM/MM single-point energy calculations and geometry optimizations. In the SMBP scheme, the outer solvent and macromolecule region is described by a boundary potential obtained with the use of Poisson-Boltzmann calculations (treating the bulk solvent as a dielectric continuum). In the QM calculations, the SMBP is represented by virtual point charges on a surface enclosing the explicitly treated inner region. These charges and their interactions with the QM density are determined through a self-consistent reaction field procedure. The accuracy of the SMBP is evaluated on three diverse test systems: the intramolecular proton transfer of glycine in water, the hydroxylation reaction in p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, and the spin state energy splittings in the pentacoordinated ferric complex of cytochrome P450cam. In the case of solvated glycine, application of the SMBP turns out to be problematic since analogous QM/MM/SMBP and full QM/MM geometry optimizations lead to different close-lying local minima. In both enzymes, the SMBP performs very well and closely reproduces the results from full QM/MM optimizations of these more rigid test systems. Starting from optimized QM/MM/SMBP structures along a reaction path, one can apply the previously implemented generalized solvent boundary potential (GSBP) to sample over MM phase space in QM/MM free energy calculations within the framework of free energy perturbation theory. This reduces the overall computational costs of sampling by 1 order of magnitude while maintaining good accuracy. The combined use of SMBP and GSBP thus allows for efficient QM/MM free energy studies of enzymes. ",

We validate the accuracy of the SMBP for these test systems and present a transferable protocol for determination of optimal SMBP parameters as well as recommended default values for these parameters. Two enzymatic reactions with different characteristics are studied: the intramolecular Claisen rearrangement in chorismate mutase that is associated with little charge transfer and the hydroxylation reaction in p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase that corresponds to a formal \"OH(+)\" transfer and thus involves significant charge transfer. It is found that the effects of the electrostatic potential of the outer macromolecule and of bulk solvent are only important in the latter case, where their neglect causes deviations in the computed barriers on the order of 1-2 kcal/mol, respectively. Even larger deviations on the order of several kilocalories per mole are observed for the reaction energies in p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase if the electrostatic potential of the outer macromolecule is neglected.

Utilizing a variety of independent reaction schemes, our best estimate is Delta(f)H(o)(0)(FCO(2)) = -86.0 +/- 0.6 kcal mol(-1) [Delta(f)H(o)(298) )(FCO(2)) = -86.7 +/- 0.6 kcal mol(-1)], which is shown to be more accurate than previous theoretical and experimental values. The chosen computational procedure was also applied to HCO (X (2)A'), where we find excellent agreement with experiment, and to FCO (X (2)A'), where we recommend an improved value of Delta(f)H(o)(0)(FCO) = -42.1 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1) [ Delta(f)H(o)(298)(FCO) = -42.0 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1)]. Further theoretical results concern the C-F bond dissociation energy, electron affinity, ionization energy, first and second excitation energies in FCO(2), fluoride ion affinity of CO(2), and equilibrium geometries of the molecules treated presently. For FCO (X (2)A') we propose an improved equilibrium structure: r(e)(CF) = 132.5(2) pm, r(e)(CO) = 116.7(2) pm, and theta(e)(FCO) = 127.8(2)(o).",

        "abstract": "We report a theoretical study of the ground electronic state of BiH3. The potential energy surface (PES) is obtained from coupled cluster CCSD(T) calculations with a large basis set (289 contracted Gaussian functions). The previously available quartic force field (P4) is extended by adding the dominant quintic and sextic stretching terms to yield improved potential functions in symmetry coordinates (P6) and Morse-type coordinates (M4). Second-order rovibrational perturbation calculations on the P4-PES and full variational calculations on the P6-PES and M4-PES yield almost identical vibrational term values which is rationalized by considering the local mode behavior of BiH3 and the Morse-type character of the M4-PES. The remaining deviations between the computed and observed vibrational term values must thus be caused by imperfections in the CCSD(T) surface. A refinement of this ab initio surface by a restrained fit to experimental data allows an essentially perfect reproduction of the observed vibrational term values. Variational calculations on this refined surface provide predictions for several overtone and combination bands that have not yet been observed.",

The ab initio results support the validity of a previous harmonic force field which has been refined with respect to experimental data while constraining certain off-diagonal force constants to scaled SCF values.

        "abstract": "Highly correlated ab initio calculations employing large basis sets are reported for monomeric methyllithium, CH 3 Li. Combining theoretical vibrational corrections and experimental ground-state rotational constants from a recent microwave investigation of three isotopomers of methyllithium, the equilibrium geometry of CH 3 Li was determined: r e ( CLi )=196.22(34) pm , r e ( CH )=109.58(14) pm , and \u2220 e (HCH)=105.69(24)\u00b0. The error bars are chosen such that a purely theoretical estimate of the r e structure is also covered. Correlated harmonic [CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ+aug(C)] and anharmonic [MP2/MT(ae)] force fields provide theoretical values for the fundamental vibrational wavenumbers in CH 3 Li which differ significantly from those observed in an argon matrix, except for the degenerate bending modes. Possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. It is concluded that reliable gas phase values are needed in order to resolve this discrepancy. Many spectroscopic constants of CH 3 Li are predicted. Keywords Ab initio calculations Equilibrium structure Fundamentals Anharmonic force fields Spectroscopic constants",

        "abstract": "Among the title species, a reliable and accurate equilibrium geometry (re structure) is available only for PF3, which has been determined experimentally more than twenty years ago. Here, we report accurate re structures for all title molecules, which were obtained using a composite computational approach based on explicitly correlated coupled-cluster theory (CCSD(T)-F12b) in conjunction with a large correlation-consistent basis set (cc-pCVQZ-F12) to take core-valence electron correlation into account. Additional terms were included to correct for the effects of iterative triple excitations (CCSDT), noniterative quadruple excitations (CCSDT(Q)), and scalar relativistic contributions (DKH2-CCSD(T)). The performance of this computational procedure was established through test calculations on selected small molecules (PH, PF, PCl, PH2, PF2, and PH3). For PF3, PCl3, PH3F2, and PF5 sufficiently accurate experimental ground-state rotational constants from the literature were used to determine semiexperimental re structures, which were found to be in excellent agreement with the corresponding best estimates from the current composite approach. The recommended equilibrium structural parameters are: for PCl3, re(PCl) = 203.94 pm and \u03b8e(ClPCl) = 100.18\u00b0; for PH3F2, re(PHeq) = 138.38 pm and re(PFax) = 164.15 pm; for PF5, re(PFeq) = 153.10 pm and re(PFax) = 157.14 pm; for PCl3F2, re(PCleq) = 200.21 pm and re(PFax) = 159.37 pm; and for PCl5, re(PCleq) = 201.29 pm and re(PClax) = 211.83 pm. The associated uncertainties are estimated to be \u00b10.10 pm and \u00b10.10\u00b0, respectively.",

        "abstract": "The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Martin Karplus, Michael Levitt and Arieh Warshel for their work on developing multiscale models for complex chemical systems (see figure). by Walter Thiel Complex chemical processes occur on different length- and timescales. Events that involve electrons, such as the making and breaking of chemical bonds, are localized in space and time. They need to be described by quantum mechanics (QM), whereas the influence of the environment and the slow motions of atoms during a reaction are normally well represented by classical molecular mechanics (MM). The laureates were the first to propose a hybrid QM/MM approach for studying chemical properties and reactions, initially for the special case of planar molecules1 and then as a general scheme for modelling enzymatic reactions2. This mathematical approach is essentially a marriage of Schr\u00f6dinger's quantum theories and classical Newtonian ideas, combining the best of both worlds to enable tailor-made simulations of complex chemical processes. The prizewinners' pioneering work in the 1970s provided explicit expressions for calculating the total QM/MM energy of a system and the QM/MM interaction terms. Advances by many research groups in QM and MM methods during the 1980s paved the way to breakthroughs for QM/MM modelling in chemistry in the 1990s. Major methodological issues were then solved by establishing suitable QM/MM interaction models and treatments for the QM/MM interface region, and efficient procedures were implemented for exploring large-scale QM/MM potential surfaces (which represent total energy as a function of atomic position). Since then, there has been an exponential growth in QM/MM applications3, all underpinned by the original work of Karplus, Levitt and Warshel. The concept of multiscale modelling is actually much broader than QM/MM, and so one can safely expect further progress towards an ever more realistic modelling of increasingly complex chemical processes. by Gerhard Hummer Multiscale molecular simulations, as pioneered by Karplus, Levitt and Warshel, proved to be versatile and powerful right from the start, revealing how receptors in the eye are activated by light, and how the resulting signals are passed on through changes in molecular conformation. The laureates' approach allows each part of a molecular system to be described at the simplest level possible: as atoms, using quantum or classical mechanics; as classical pseudoparticles that represent multiple atoms; or, in the case of bulk solvent, as a continuous medium that lacks atomic detail2, 4. Molecular interactions are captured by potential surfaces. Such potentials are now used routinely to determine protein structures from experimental data, to develop new drugs and to rationally design materials. Simulations also provide fundamental insight into the function of biomolecular 'machinery' by revealing the underlying molecular motions and energetic driving forces. From photosynthesis to the processing of genetic material5, enzyme-catalysed reactions have been modelled and followed atom by atom, bond by bond3. The dynamics of molecular motors that power muscle contraction or the synthesis of ATP molecules \u2014 a cell's source of energy \u2014 have also been simulated. Even the self-assembly of biomolecular machinery can be studied, from the folding of proteins6 to the formation of entire organelles7 and the protein shells of viruses8. With increasingly accurate representations of the energetics and dynamics of molecular systems, simulations yield detailed quantitative information and mechanistic insight that are unattainable in laboratory experiments. The vision of computational modelling as a reliable substitute for actual experiments is thus becoming a reality. Download references",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The high-resolution infrared spectra of trifluorophosphine (PF 3 ) were reinvestigated in the  \u03bd  4  fundamental region near 350\u00a0cm \u22121 , and around 690\u00a0cm \u22121 , with the aim to provide a necessary reassignment of the 2 \u00b12  sublevel of the  v  4 \u00a0=\u00a02 overtone level. The present paper reports on the first complete study of both sublevels of  v  4 \u00a0=\u00a02 (of  A  1  and  E  symmetry, corresponding to  l  4 \u00a0=\u00a00 and \u00b12, respectively), through the high-resolution analysis of the overtone     2    \u03bd    4    0       band and the     2    \u03bd    4    \u00b1  2    -    \u03bd    4    \u00b1  1       hot band. The assignments of the latter were corrected and extended, spanning the rotational states  J \u00a0\u2a7d\u00a082 and \u221280\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a0 K \u2033\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0\u0394 K \u00a0\u2a7d\u00a048. These new infrared assignments in the  v  4 \u00a0=\u00a02 state were combined with accurate infrared, radiofrequency, centimeter-, millimeter- and submillimeter-wave data of the  v  4 \u00a0=\u00a01 level (Thiessen et al., 2000), together with rotational data in the ground vibrational state (Cotti et al., 1995), in a simultaneous fit. The existence of resonance crossings due to a \u0394 k \u00a0=\u00a0\u00b11, \u0394 l \u00a0=\u00a0\u22132  l -type resonance in the  v  4 \u00a0=\u00a01 state, which generated perturbation-allowed transitions, provided independent values of the  C  4  and  C\u03b6  4  constants. Combining these rotational transitions with the wavenumbers of the  \u03bd  4  fundamental band enabled us to determine accurately the  C  0  axial ground state constant. Moreover, the assignment of a few, very weak   r   R K   transitions in the     2    \u03bd    4    -  2       overtone band and their inclusion in the global least-squares fit allowed also the first accurate experimental determination of       D    K    0      . The obtained results are (in cm \u22121 ):  C  0 \u00a0=\u00a00.159970241(29) and       D    K    0      =1.80457(49)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22127 .  Quadratic, cubic, and semidiagonal quartic force fields of PF 3  have been calculated at the CCSD(T) level of theory employing a variety of large correlation-consistent basis sets. These force fields have been used to evaluate spectroscopic constants which are generally found to be in very good agreement with experiment. The present best estimate of the  r e   structure of PF 3  based on an explicitly correlated coupled-cluster approach (CCSD(T)-F12b) is almost identical with its latest experimental counterpart.",

Experimental results are complemented by surface hopping dynamic simulations and evaluation of the excited-state ionization energy by Koopmans' theorem. Two alternative models for the relaxation dynamics are discussed. The experimentally observed excited-state lifetime is about 2.5 ps if the molecule is excited at 266 nm and about 1.1 ps if the molecule is excited at 238 nm. The experimental probe photon energy dependence of the photoelectron kinetic energy distribution suggests that the probe step is not vertical and involves a doubly-excited autoionizing state.",

For some of the complexes, an appropriate treatment of doubly excited states is essential to correctly describe their spectroscopic and photochemical properties. Geometrical and solvent relaxation effects are also assessed. An adequate treatment of solvent effects seems critical for an accurate description of the NLO properties of these complexes. ",

        "abstract": "The semiempirical MNDO-based AM1 and PM3 methods and the orthogonalization-corrected OM1, OM2, and OM3 models were reparameterized to improve their description of bulk water and of proton transfer in water. Reference data included the gas-phase geometries and energies of the water molecule, small water clusters, the hydronium ion, and small hydronium ion-water clusters, as well as the gas-phase potential energy surface for proton transfer between the two water molecules in a Zundel ion, all calculated at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. Combined QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for bulk water and for a proton solvated in water using large cluster models. Both the authentic and reparameterized semiempirical models were employed in the simulations. The reparameterization led to significantly better results in all cases. The new set of OM3 parameters gave the best overall results for the structural and dynamic properties of water and the hydrated proton, with a small but finite barrier of 0.1-0.2 kcal/mol in the potential of mean force for proton transfer, in agreement with ab initio path-integral molecular dynamics simulations. The reparameterized OM3 model is expected to be useful for efficient modeling of proton transfer in aqueous solution. ",

Semiempirical calculations using the MNDO, AM1, PM3, OM1, OM2, and OM3 model Hamiltonians were systematically profiled for three types of test systems (fullerenes, water clusters, and solvated crambin) to identify the most time-consuming sections of the code. The corresponding routines were ported to the GPU and optimized employing both existing library functions and a GPU kernel that carries out a sequence of noniterative Jacobi transformations during pseudodiagonalization. The overall computation times for single-point energy calculations and geometry optimizations of large molecules were reduced by one order of magnitude for all methods, as compared to runs on a single CPU core.

        "abstract": "Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) catalyzes the reduction of 7,8-dihydrofolate by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydride (NADPH) to form 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate and oxidized nicotinamide. DHFR is a small, flexible, monomeric protein with no metals or SS bonds and serves as one of the enzymes commonly used to examine basic aspects in enzymology. In the current work, we present extensive benchmark calculations for several model reactions in the gas phase that are relevant to the DHFR catalyzed hydride transfer. To this end, we employ G4MP2 and CBS-QB3 ab initio calculations as well as numerous density functional theory methods. Using these results, we develop two specific reaction parameter (SRP) Hamiltonians based on the semiempirical AM1 method. The first generation SRP Hamiltonian does not account for dispersion, while the second generation SRP accounts for dispersion implicitly via the AM1 core-repulsion functions. These SRP semiempirical Hamiltonians are subsequently used in hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations of the DHFR catalyzed reaction. Finally, kinetic isotope effects are computed using a mass-perturbation-based path-integral approach. ",

In addition, they include Grimme's dispersion correction D3 with Becke-Johnson damping and three-body corrections E^{ABC} for Axilrod-Teller-Muto dispersion interactions as integral parts. Heats of formation are determined by adding explicitly computed zero-point vibrational energy and thermal corrections, in contrast to standard MNDO-type and OMx methods. We report ODMx parameters for hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine that are optimized with regard to a wide range of carefully chosen state-of-the-art reference data. Extensive benchmarks show that the ODMx methods generally perform better than the available MNDO-type and OMx methods for ground-state and excited-state properties, while they describe noncovalent interactions with similar accuracy as OMx methods with a posteriori dispersion corrections.",

The decay dynamics to the ground state shows an oscillatory pattern that can be attributed to an out-of-plane rotation of the N2 moiety. The reaction is thus initially driven by N2 rotation which triggers phenyl rotations around the C-N bonds. The cis isomer is produced most effectively when the phenyl rings rotate in phase. Mode-specific excitations cause variations in the computed decay times and product yields. ",

        "abstract": "A new versatile code based on Python scripts was developed to calculate spin-orbit coupling (SOC) elements between singlet and triplet states. The code, named PySOC, is interfaced to third-party quantum chemistry packages, such as Gaussian 09 and DFTB+. SOCs are evaluated using linear-response (LR) methods based on time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA), and time-dependent density functional tight binding (TD-DFTB). The evaluation employs Casida-type wave functions and the Breit-Pauli (BP) spin-orbit Hamiltonian with an effective charge approximation. For validation purposes, SOCs calculated with PySOC are benchmarked for several organic molecules, with SOC values spanning several orders of magnitude. The computed SOCs show little variation with the basis set, but are sensitive to the chosen density functional. The benchmark results are in good agreement with reference data obtained using higher-level spin-orbit Hamiltonians and electronic structure methods, such as CASPT2 and DFT/MRCI. PySOC can be easily interfaced to other third-party codes and other methods yielding CI-type wave functions.",

        "abstract": "Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations of reactions in solutions and in solvated enzymes can be performed using the QM/MM-Ewald approach with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) or a nonperiodic treatment with a finite solvent shell (droplet model). To avoid the changes in QM codes that are required in standard QM/MM-Ewald implementations, we present a general method (Gen-Ew) for periodic QM/MM calculations that can be used with any QM method in the QM/MM framework. The Gen-Ew approach approximates the QM/MM-Ewald method by representing the PBC potential by virtual charges on a sphere and the QM density by electrostatic potential (ESP) charges. Test calculations show that the deviations between Gen-Ew and QM/MM-Ewald results are generally small enough to justify the application of the Gen-Ew method in the absence of a suitable QM/MM-Ewald implementation. We compare the results from periodic QM/MM calculations (QM/MM-Ewald, Gen-Ew) to their nonperiodic counterparts (droplet model) for five test reactions in water and for the Claisen rearrangement in chorismate mutase. The periodic and nonperiodic QM/MM treatments give similar free energy profiles for the reactions in solution (umbrella sampling, free energy deviations of the order of 1 kcal/mol) and essentially the same energy profile (constrained geometry optimizations) for the Claisen rearrangement in chorismate mutase. In all cases considered, long-range electrostatic interactions are thus well captured by nonperiodic QM/MM calculations in a water droplet of reasonable size (radius of 15-20 \u00c5). This provides further justification for the widespread use of the computationally efficient droplet model in QM/MM studies of reactions in solution and in enzymes. ",

We show how the excited-state energies, the charge transfer (CT) states, and the electron-hole density distributions are strongly influenced by the size, the orientation, and the position (i.e., on-top versus on-edge phases) of P3HT/PCBM domains. We discuss how the structural order influences the excited-state electronic structure, providing an atomistic interpretation of the photophysics of organic blends. We show how the simultaneous presence of on-top and on-edge phases does not alter the optical absorption spectrum of the blend but does affect the photophysics. Photovoltaic processes such as (i) the simultaneous charge generation obtained from hot and cold excitations, (ii) the instantaneous and delayed charge separation, and (iii) the pump-push-probe charge generation can be interpreted based on our study.",

        "abstract": "We describe the synthesis as well as the electronic and photophysical characterization of novel N-heterotriangulene derivatives decorated with methoxycarbonyl- and methyl-sulfanyl-substituted dithiafulvenyl moieties. The association of these electron-rich compounds with fullerene C as electron acceptor was investigated by means of photophysical, voltammetric, and mass spectrometric methods and rationalized by DFT calculations. Importantly, light-induced interactions between the dithiafulvene-substituted N-heterotriangulene bearing methoxycarbonyl substituents with C leads to cooperative fluorescence. Quantitative Job plot analyses by means of fluorescence spectroscopy and voltammetry confirm a 1:1 association with binding constants in the order of 10 \u2009m . Supportive results for the supramolecular assembly of both N-heterotriangulenes with C were obtained by ESI mass spectrometric investigations in the gas phase.",

        "abstract": "Electrospray ionisation of N-heterotriangulenes (i.e. dimethylmethylene-bridged triphenylamines) with up to three pyridyl groups at their periphery, produces the true radical cation ([M]+*) and the protonated molecule ([M+H]+) simultaneously. These ions are studied as model systems to illustrate the stability alternation of odd- versus even-electron ions in energy-dependent collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments. All ions show the same fragmentation pattern, the consecutive loss of three methyl radicals (*CH3) from the dimethylmethylene bridges of the central triangulene core. [M]+* ions dissociate at much lower collision energies than their [M+H]+ counterparts. The radical cation forms a singlet fragment with an extended aromatic system that is energetically favoured. Ab initio and density functional theory calculations support this interpretation and allow the assignment of the electronic structure of the fragment ions. Consecutive collision-induced dissociations provide a better match with theory when studied with an ion trap, rather than a linear quadrupole. This is attributed to the resonant nature of the excitation of intermediate ions.",

        "abstract": "The recognition of the dual binding mode of propargyl and allyl alcohols to [Cp*Ru] fragments fostered the development of a highly regioselective intermolecular Alder-ene-type reaction of alkynes with 1,2-disubstituted alkenes. The increased substrate scope opens new perspectives in stereochemical terms. As the loaded catalyst is chiral-at-metal, stereochemical information is efficiently relayed from the propargylic site to the emerging C-C bond. This interpretation is based on the X-ray structure of the first Cp*Ru complex carrying an intact enyne ligand, and provides valuable insights into bonding and activation of the substrates. Computational data draw a clear picture of the principles governing regio- and stereocontrol.",

Both algorithms generate reasonable water shells, but the new approach provides solvated systems with an increased water-enzyme interaction and offers further advantages. It enables a stepwise buildup of the solvent shell, so that the more important inner part can be prepared more carefully. It also allows the generation of solute structures which can be biased either toward the (experimental) starting structure or the underlying theoretical model, i.e., the employed force field. ",

        "abstract": "Semiempirical quantum mechanical (SQM) methods offer a fast approximate treatment of the electronic structure and the properties of large molecules. Careful benchmarks are required to establish their accuracy. Here, we report a validation of standard SQM methods using a subset of the comprehensive GMTKN24 database for general main group thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions, which has recently been introduced to evaluate density functional theory (DFT) methods ( J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2010 , 6 , 107 ). For all SQM methods considered presently, parameters are available for the elements H, C, N, and O, and consequently, we have extracted from the GMTKN24 database all species containing only these four elements (excluding multireference cases). The resulting GMTKN24-hcno database has 370 entries (derived from 593 energies) compared with 715 entries (derived from 1033 energies) in the original GMTKN24 database. The current benchmark covers established standard SQM methods (AM1, PM6), more recent approaches with orthogonalization corrections (OM1, OM2, OM3), and the self-consistent-charge density functional tight binding method (SCC-DFTB). The results are compared against each other and against DFT results using standard functionals. We find that the OMx methods outperform AM1, PM6, and SCC-DFTB by a significant margin, with a substantial gain in accuracy especially for OM2 and OM3. These latter methods are quite accurate even in comparison with DFT, with an overall mean absolute deviation of 6.6 kcal/mol for PBE and 7.9 kcal/mol for OM3. The OMx methods are also remarkably robust with regard to the unusual bonding situations encountered in the \"mindless\" MB08-165 test set, for which all other SQM methods fail badly. ",

        "abstract": "We report a comparison of QM-only and QM/MM approaches for the modeling of enzymatic reactions. For this purpose, we present a QM/MM case study on the formation of vinyl alcohol in the catalytic cycle of tungsten-dependent acetylene hydratase. Three different QM regions ranging from 32 to 157 atoms are designed for the reinvestigation of the previously suggested one-water attack mechanism. The QM/MM calculations with the minimal QM region M1 (32 atoms) yield a two-step reaction profile, with an initial nucleophilic attack followed by the protonation of the formed vinyl anion intermediate, as previously proposed on the basis of QM-only calculations on cluster model M2 (116 atoms); however, the overall QM/MM barrier with M1 is much too high, mainly due to an overestimate of the QM/MM electrostatic repulsions. QM/MM calculations with QM region M2 (116 atoms) fail to reproduce the published QM-only results, giving a one-step profile with a very high barrier. This is traced back to the strong electrostatic influence of the two neighboring diphosphate groups that were neglected in the QM-only work but are present at the QM/MM level. These diphosphate groups and other electrostatically important nearby residues are included in QM region M3 (157 atoms). QM/MM calculations with M3 recover the two-step mechanism and yield a reasonable overall barrier of 16.7 kcal/mol at the B3LYP/MM level. They thus lead to a similar overall mechanistic scenario as the previous QM-only calculations, but there are also some important variations. Most notably, the initial nucleophilic attack becomes rate limiting at the QM/MM level. A modified two-water attack mechanism is also considered but is found to be less favorable than the previously proposed one-water attack mechanism. Detailed residue interaction analyses and comparisons between QM/MM results with electronic and mechanical embedding and QM-only results without and with continuum solvation show that the protein environment plays a key role in determining the mechanistic preferences in acetylene hydratase. The combined use of QM-only and QM/MM methods provides a powerful approach for the modeling of enzyme catalysis. ",

        "abstract": "We address the performance of the vertical and adiabatic Franck-Condon (VFC/AFC) approaches combined with time-independent or time-dependent (TI/TD) formalisms in simulating the one-photon absorption spectra of three flavin compounds with distinct structural features. Calculations were done in the gas phase and in two solvents (water, benzene) for which experimental reference measurements are available. We utilized the independent mode displaced harmonic oscillator model without or with frequency alteration (IMDHO/IMDHO-FA) and also accounted for Duschinsky mixing effects. In the initial validation on the first excited singlet state of riboflavin, the range-separated functionals, CAM-B3LYP and \u03c9B97xD, showed the best performance, but B3LYP also gave a good compromise between peak positions and spectral topology. Large basis sets were not mandatory to obtain high-quality spectra for the selected systems. The presence of a symmetry plane facilitated the computation of vibrationally broadened spectra, since different FC variants yield similar results and the harmonic approximation holds rather well. Compared with the AFC approach, the VFC approach performed equally well or even better for all three flavins while offering several advantages, such as avoiding error-prone geometry optimization procedures on excited-state surfaces. We also explored the advantages of curvilinear displacements and of a Duschinsky treatment for the AFC spectra in cases when a rotatable group is present on the chromophore. Taken together, our findings indicate that the combination of the VFC approach with the TD formalism and the IMDHO-FA model offers the best overall performance.",

        "abstract": "We investigate possible improvements in the accuracy of semiempirical quantum chemistry (SQC) methods through the use of machine learning (ML) models for the parameters. For a given class of compounds, ML techniques require sufficiently large training sets to develop ML models that can be used for adapting SQC parameters to reflect changes in molecular composition and geometry. The ML-SQC approach allows the automatic tuning of SQC parameters for individual molecules, thereby improving the accuracy without deteriorating transferability to molecules with molecular descriptors very different from those in the training set. The performance of this approach is demonstrated for the semiempirical OM2 method using a set of 6095 constitutional isomers CHO, for which accurate  atomization enthalpies are available. The ML-OM2 results show improved average accuracy and a much reduced error range compared with those of standard OM2 results, with mean absolute errors in atomization enthalpies dropping from 6.3 to 1.7 kcal/mol. They are also found to be superior to the results from specific OM2 reparameterizations (rOM2) for the same set of isomers. The ML-SQC approach thus holds promise for fast and reasonably accurate high-throughput screening of materials and molecules.",

        "abstract": "The reaction FeO(+) + H2 \u2192 Fe(+) + H2O is a simple model for hydrogen abstraction processes in biologically important heme systems. The geometries of all relevant stationary points on the lowest sextet and quartet surfaces were optimized using several density functionals as well as the CASSCF method. The corresponding energy profiles were computed at the following levels: density functional theory using gradient-corrected, hybrid, meta, hybrid-meta, and perturbatively corrected double hybrid functionals; single-reference coupled cluster theory including up to single, double, triple, and perturbative quadruple excitations [CCSDT(Q)]; correlated multireference ab initio methods (MRCI, MRAQCC, SORCI, SORCP, MRMP2, NEVPT2, and CASPT2). The calculated energies were corrected for scalar relativistic effects, zero-point vibrational energies, and core-valence correlation effects. MRCI and SORCI energies were corrected for size-consistency errors using an a posteriori Davidson correction (+Q) leading to MRCI+Q and SORCI+Q. Comparison with the available experimental data shows that CCSDT(Q) is most accurate and can thus serve as benchmark method for this electronically challenging reaction. Among the density functionals, B3LYP performs best. In the correlated ab initio calculations with a full-valence active space, SORCI+Q yields the lowest deviations from the CCSDT(Q) reference results, with qualitatively similar energy profiles being obtained from MRCI+Q and MRAQCC. SORCI+Q benefits from the quality of the approximate average natural orbitals used in the final step of the SORCI procedure. Many of the tested methods show surprisingly large errors. The present results validate the common use of B3LYP in computational studies of heme systems and offer guidance on which correlated ab initio methods are most suitable for such studies. ",

        "abstract": "We report a theoretical study of the photoisomerization step in the operating cycle of a prototypical fluorene-based molecular rotary motor (1). The potential energy surfaces of the ground electronic state (S0) and the first singlet excited state (S1) are explored by semiempirical quantum-chemical calculations using the orthogonalization-corrected OM2 Hamiltonian in combination with a multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) treatment. The OM2/MRCI results for the S0 and S1 minima of the relevant 1-P and 1-M isomers and for the corresponding S0 transition state are in good agreement with higher-level calculations, both with regard to geometries and energetics. The S1 surface is characterized at the OM2/MRCI level by locating two S0-S1 minimum-energy conical intersections and nearby points on the intersection seam and by computing energy profiles for pathways toward these MECIs. Semiclassical Tully-type trajectory surface hopping (TSH) simulations with on-the-fly OM2/MRCI calculations are carried out to study the excited-state dynamics after photoexcitation to the S1 state. Fast relaxation to the ground state is observed through the conical intersection regions, predominantly through the lowest-energy one with a strongly twisted central C\u2550C double bond and pyramidalized central carbon atom. The excited-state lifetimes for the direct and inverse photoisomerization reactions (1.40 and 1.79 ps) and the photostationary state ratio (2.7:1) from the TSH-OM2 simulations are in good agreement with the available experimental data (ca. 1.7 ps and 3:1). Excited-state lifetimes, photostationary state ratio, and dynamical details of the TSH-OM2 simulations also agree with classical molecular dynamics simulations using a reparametrized optimized potentials for liquid simulations (OPLS) all-atom force field with ad-hoc surface hops at predefined conical intersection points. The latter approach allows for a more extensive statistical sampling. ",

The major reason why the sense of induction can be switched from (S) to (R) solely by changing either the solvent or the temperature or the nature of the counterion X is likely found in the bias of the organogold intermediates to undergo assisted proto-deauration. Such assistance can be provided by a protic solvent, a reasonably coordinating counterion or even by a second substrate molecule itself; in this case, the reaction free energy profile gains a strong entropic component that can ultimately dictate the stereochemical course.

Those transformations usually rely on internal coordination through \"directing groups\", carefully designed to maximize catalytic efficiency and regioselectivity. Herein, we report structural and reactivity studies of a series of internally coordinated monohaptoallylpalladium complexes. These species enable the direct spectroscopic observation and theoretical study of \u03c0-\u03c3-\u03c0 interconversion processes. They further display unusual dynamic behavior which should be of direct relevance to chemistries beyond catalytic allylic alkylation.",

        "abstract": "A variationally computed $^{28}$SiH$_4$ rotation-vibration line list applicable for temperatures up to $T=1200,$K is presented. The line list, called OY2T, considers transitions with rotational excitation up to $J=42$ in the wavenumber range $0$--$5000,$cm$^{-1}$ (wavelengths $lambdau003e 2,mu$m). Just under 62.7 billion transitions have been calculated between 6.1 million energy levels. Rovibrational calculations have utilized a new `spectroscopicu0027 potential energy surface determined by empirical refinement to 1452 experimentally derived energy levels up to $J=6$, and a previously reported textit{ab initio} dipole moment surface. The temperature-dependent partition function of silane, the OY2T line list format, and the temperature dependence of the OY2T line list are discussed. Comparisons with the PNNL spectral library and other experimental sources indicate that the OY2T line list is robust and able to accurately reproduce weaker intensity features. The full line list is available from the ExoMol database and the CDS database.",
