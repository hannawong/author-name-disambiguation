A supramolecular synthon I [R2 2(7)] containing classical O-H\u22efN and weak C-H\u22efO interactions, usually observed in organic cocrystals of carboxylic acids with other heterocyclic bases, is again shown to be involved in constructing most of these hydrogen-bonding networks. In compounds 3-5, tapes of acid/base components are formed via synthon I, which are further extended to result in two-dimensional (2-D) supramolecular sheets via additional C-H\u22efO interactions. Compound 2 contains similar but helical tapes with synthon I, and the neighboring twisted chains are cross-linked via weak C-H\u22efO hydrogen bonds to show a 2-D corrugated network. Compound 6 contains a similar 2-D layered structure to that of 3-5, although synthon I was not found due to the stereochemistry effect. Unexpectedly, adjacent layers are further combined into a three-dimensional (3-D) architecture through acid-base C-H\u22efO hydrogen bonds. However, in compound 1, through intermolecular O-H\u22efN and C-H\u22efO bonds, a novel 3-D structure was formed, in which acid and base subunits arrange alternately to exhibit a helical motif along the crystallographic [100] direction. For all these cocrystals, the common head-to-tail hydrogen-bonded ring motif [synthon II R2 2(8)] between carboxylic acids is absent. Melting points of cocrystals 1-6 are mainly correlated with the nature of the acid component and crystal packing. Thermogravimetric analysis of mass loss for six compounds has been shown to correlate with the strength of hydrogen bonds in the packing fraction. \u00a9 2005 American Chemical Society.",

For both complexes, each CuII center is penta-coordinate in a distorted square-pyramidal environment with the bridging chloride atom at the apical position. The magnetic properties of mono-\u03bc-chloro CuII dinuclear complexes have been investigated for the first time through the study of complexes 1 and 2 by variable temperature magnetic susceptibility and magnetization measurements.

Abstract A novel 3D coordination polymer {[Dy 2 (bpdc) 3 (H 2 O) 3 ] \u00b7 H 2 O} n (bpdc = 2,2\u2032-bipyridine-4,4\u2032- dicarboxylate) based on inorganic rod-shaped infinite secondary building unit is presented, which possesses unusual mixed-connected network topology and shows high thermal stability and strong photoluminescence at room temperature. Keywords Coordination polymer Network topology Thermal stability Luminescent property As an evergreen research area, the rational design and construction of coordination polymers has attracted considerable attention, which originates from their enthralling network topologies and potential applications in microelectronics, nonlinear optics, porous materials, catalysis, etc. [1\u20134] . Although the main goal in the field is to synthesize new functional crystalline materials, without the understanding of topology, it would be difficult to achieve another true advance [5] . In this sense, the effort on network topology will be one of the subjects of central importance within this area, which can precisely describe the complicated structures of extended solid-state materials [1,3,6] . Fortunately, Wells has classified the network structures in crystals and spawned the \u201cvertices (metal ions/ligands)-and-spacer (linkers between vertices)\u201d methodology [7] , which lays the foundation for general understanding of inorganic solids and metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs). Up to now, a variety of uninodal coordination networks have been well realized, among which three-, four-, and six-connected topologies are commonly observed. Nevertheless, examples of five-, seven-, and eight-connected coordination frameworks remain scarce, due to the limited coordination numbers of metal centers and steric hindrance issues of organic ligands. In other ways, inspired by the prominent work of O\u2019keeffee, Ramsden, Blatov, Robson, and their co-workers [1,7\u20139] , a valuable discovery is that the topological paradigms of some MOFs are consistent with those of the natural minerals, such as diamond, Pt 3 O 4 , boracite, CdSO 4 , PtS, CaB 6 , NbO, perovskite, pyrite, rutile, quartz, sodalite, SrSi 2 , CsCl, and tungsten bronze [2,5,10] . Meanwhile, some binodal networks have also been reported recently, such as (3,4)-, (3,5)-, (3,6)-, (3,9)-, (4,5)-, (4,8)-, (4,10)-, (5,6)-, and (6,8)-connected coordination frameworks [11] , and this will undoubtedly extend our understanding on such crystalline solids. Even now, there is an unfavorable lack of systematic and characteristic investigation on higher dimensional networks with mixed connectivity, especially multinodal networks suchlike (3,4,6)-, (3,4,8)-, (4,5,6)- and (3,4,5,6)-connected frameworks, which are considered to be difficult to achieve [12] . In fact, at this stage, there is few available experimental data to predict which, if any, of many thousands of possible topologies will dominate for each of these connected types. As a result, further studies on the design and assembly of MOFs with mixed connectivity will not only lead to an increasing emphasis towards identifying and classifying their underlying novel topologies, but also enrich the structural database of MOFs and extend their applied area. To address this issue, considering the limited number of coordination sites at the d-block metal centers, our strategy is to use f-block metal ions and multidentate ligands as nodes to construct periodic mixed-connected network. Herein, we report a highly-thermostable 3D coordination polymer {[Dy 2 (bpdc) 3 (H 2 O) 3 ] \u00b7 H 2 O} n ( 1 ) (bpdc = 2,2\u2032-bipyridine-4,4\u2032-dicarboxylate) with unprecedented mixed-connected network structure. Compound 1 was prepared by hydrothermal method in 64% yield [13] and the structure was determined by X-ray single crystal diffraction [14] . Each asymmetric unit contains two Dy III ions, three bpdc anionic ligands, three aqua ligands, and one lattice water. The coordination environments of two crystallographically independent Dy III centers (Dy1 and Dy2) are shown in Fig. 1 , which are eight-coordinate but exhibit different coordination spheres ( Fig. S1 ). Dy1 is coordinated to seven carboxylate oxygen atoms from six carboxyl groups of bpdc and one terminal water oxygen atom, forming a slightly distorted dicapped trigonal prism polyhedron. Whereas Dy2 is in a dodecahedron geometry consisting of six carboxylate oxygen atoms from five carboxyl groups of bpdc and two water oxygen atoms. The Dy\u2013O bond distances are in the range of 2.247(4)\u20132.756(3) \u00c5 for Dy\u2013O carboxylate and 2.332(4)\u20132.426(3) \u00c5 for Dy\u2013O water , which are comparable to those reported for other Dy\u2013O donor complexes [15] . As for the bpdc ligands ( Fig. S2 ), the carboxylate groups take the syn\u2013syn bridging and \u03b7 -O , O \u2032-\u03bc- O , O binding modes in types I and II ligands, respectively, whereas those in types III and IV that have imposed centrosymmetry, adopt the syn\u2013anti bridging and unidentate fashions. Thus, the eight-coordinate Dy III ions are linked by carboxylate groups of bpdc to construct infinite 1D Dy\u2013O\u2013C chains running along the [0 0 1] direction, in which the Dy III ions are arranged in the nonlinear fashion. ( Figs. S3a and S3b ). These Dy\u2013O\u2013C chains, as rod-shaped infinite secondary building units (SBUs), are connected by types II and III ligands to form a 2D layer ( Fig. S3c ). The layers are further extended by type IV ligands and the SBUs between the layers are also cross-linked by type I ligands, generating a 3D noninterpenetrating network ( Figs. S4 and S5 ). It is noteworthy that in spite of the compact arrangement of the coordination framework, potential solvent accessible void (127.6 \u00c5 3 , 6.8% of the cell volume as calculated by PLATON [16] ) is observed, in which the uncoordinated water molecules are situated ( Fig. S6 ). The presence and content of lattice water has also been confirmed by elemental analysis and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. In addition, there still remains small interstice of 72.2 \u00c5 3 (3.8% of the cell volume) for the overall crystalline lattice of 1 . In 1 , there exist strong \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions between adjacent pyridyl rings of the bpdc ligands (the centroid\u22efcentroid distance between the pyridyl rings are 3.658(3) \u00c5 and 3.697(3) \u00c5, with the dihedral angle of ca. 3.3\u00b0) ( Figs. S3c and S5a ). Meanwhile, the hydrogen-bonding interactions from coordinated water molecules to carboxylate oxygen atoms and from coordinated/guest water molecules to guest water molecules as well as pyridyl nitrogens are found ( Table S1 ). These weak interactions may contribute to the additional stability of the whole structure. Although the organic linker is long in 1 , it is evident that the close packed Dy\u2013O\u2013C chains connected by bpdc prevent the formation of an interpenetrating structure. This may also provide a clue that a layer-and-spacer approach may be useful to construct 3D metal\u2013organic frameworks. In order to identify the complicated connectivity of the ligands and metal centers, the network topology of 1 is further analyzed. In this context, each Dy1 center is six-connected with vertex symbol of (4.4.4.4.4.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.7 3 .7 5 .8 8 ) and Dy2 is five-connected node with vertex symbol of (4.4.4.4.4.4.6.6.6 2 .6 2 ), and the ligands of types I, II, and III are four-connected nodes (3Dy1 + 1Dy2 for I, 2Dy1 + 2Dy2 for II, and 4Dy2 for III) with vertex symbols of (4.4 2 .4.7 2 .6 2 .6 2 ), (4.6.4 2 .4 2 .6 2 .6 2 ), and (4.4.4.4.6 2 .6 2 ), respectively. Notably, the type IV ligand is only a 2-connecting spacer. As a result, a very complicated 3D five-nodal coordination framework with (4,5,6)-mixed connectivity is formed ( Fig. 2 and Fig. S7 ), which has the Schl\u00e4fli symbol of (4 3 .6 2 .7) 2 (4 3 .6 3 ) 2 (4 4 .6 2 )(4 5 .6 7 .7 2 .8) 2 (4 6 .6 4 ) 2 . Alternately, if we consider the familiar dimeric [Dy1(\u03bc-O) 2 Dy2] subunits as the eight-connected nodes, and thus, the ligands of types I and III turn to three-connecting and four-connecting and the other ligands are two-connecting. In this case, the overall 3D network is three-nodal with the Schl\u00e4fli symbol of (3 2 .4 2 .5 2 ) (3 2 .4 5 .5 4 .6 11 .7 6 ) 2 (4 2 .6) 2 , as shown in Figs. S8 and S7 . Therefore, the topological structure of 1 can be classified as a (4,5,6)-connected or (3,4,8)-connected 3D network. The unique topological net with mixed-connected node is rarely observed in coordination polymers up to now [1,12] . Recently, Peng et al. have enumerated a (3,4,5,6)-connected net [12b] based on polyoxometalates (POMs); Zhu et al. have reported a (3,4,6)-connected net, which adopts the octahedral, tetrahedral, and square SBUs as nodes, respectively [12d] . As far as we know, although some high-connected coordination networks, based on f-block metal ions and multicarboxylate ligands with diverse connectivity, have been demonstrated [11] , the net in 1 represents a new mixed-connected topology structure. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of compound 1 was performed in the atmosphere of nitrogen. The TGA trace ( Fig S9 ) illustrates that the guest water molecule is removed initially with increasing the temperature, and the loss of three coordinated water molecules then follows upon further heating to 145 \u00b0C (total weight loss of 6.38%, calcd 6.41%). In the temperature range of 145\u2013480 \u00b0C, a weight loss of 4.36% may correspond to the release of 1 mol CO 2 per formula unit (calcd 4.00%), and this implies the possible decarboxylate reaction of the bpdc ligand [17] . The decomposition of the residual complex starts at 480 \u00b0C and ends at above 560 \u00b0C. The final product is assumed to be Dy 2 O 3 (found weight 32.97%), which is supported by the expected value of 33.20% and also confirmed by the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns (see Fig. S8 , beyond 500 \u00b0C, the diffraction peaks of Dy 2 O 3 appear). Notably, temperature-variable PXRD patterns of 1 (see Fig. S10 ) also reveal that the lattice structure is at least stable up to 400 \u00b0C, in which all water moieties have been excluded. The high coordination number and coordination tendency of lanthanide ions with the bpdc ligand should have a profound effect on the overall framework rigidity and thermal stability of 1 [18] , which may also arise from the significant \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions. Photoluminescence property of powder samples of 1 has also been examined at room temperature, which emits yellow light when excited at 340 nm. In the photoluminescence spectrum of 1 ( Fig. S11 ), the emission bands at 483, 577, and 667 nm indicate the characteristic behaviors of Dy 3+ ions, which are assigned to 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H J ( J = 15/2, 13/2, and 11/2) transitions, respectively. Moreover, the yellow hypersensitive transition, 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 13/2 , as the preferred transition for dysprosium-containing luminescent materials, is more intense than the blue transition 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 15/2 in 1 . This can be attributed to the noncentrosymmetric coordination environment around the Dy centers [19] , and also implies that ligand is suitable for the sensitization of yellow luminescence for Dy 3+ ions [20] . In summary, a novel coordination polymer {[Dy 2 (bpdc) 3 (H 2 O) 3 ] \u00b7 H 2 O} n has been successfully synthesized through hydrothermal route, which shows unusual mixed-connected network topology as well as high thermal stability and strong fluorescent emission. This work may offer a feasible strategy for rational combinations of different connectivity within a net structure, and may also enrich the family of lanthanide chemistry.

        "abstract": "By simply introducing different alkali metal ions as structure-directing agents, four new coordination polymers with the formulae [Cd3(BDC- F4)3(DMF)2(MeOH)6]n (1), [Cd(BDC-F4)(DMF)2(H2O)2] n (2), [Zn2Na2(BDC-Cl4) 3(DMF)4(\u03bc2-MeOH)]n (3) and [ZnK(BDC-Cl4)1.5(DMF)(Me2NH)]n (4) (BDC-F4 = 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-benzenedicarboxylate; BDC-Cl 4 = 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-benzenedicarboxylate; DMF = dimethylformamide and Me2NH = dimethylamine) have been synthesized and structurally characterized. Complex 1 presents an open three-dimensional (3D) 3-nodal (3,4)-connected framework, 2 has a one-dimensional (1D) chain structure, 3 features a 3D 4-nodal (3,4,5,6)-connected coordination network constructed from the new ZnII-NaI heterometallic tetranuclear cluster, and 4 shows a 3D 4-nodal (3,5,6)-connected network based on the unique Zn II-KI heterometallic tetranuclear cluster. The results reveal the significant influence of alkali-metal ions on the structural topologies of complexes 1-4. Interestingly, compounds 1-4 all exhibit high water solubility, and futher evaporation of their water solution will result in a 1D coordination polymer {[Cd4(BDC-F4)4(H 2O)11]\u00b73.5H2O}n (5) consisting of the unprecedented polymeric [CdII-H2O] n chain, and a zero-dimensional (0D) complex [Zn(H2O) 6]\u00b7(BDC-Cl4)\u00b74H2O (6) containing the discrete [Zn(H2O)6]2+ cationic and BDC-Cl4 dianionic moieties. Furthermore, the solution chemistry of complexes 5 and 6 has been investigated by electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry and molar electrical conductivity. The photoluminescent properties of complexes 1-6 have also been explored, which interestingly indicate a strong blue emission of complex 1 in the solid state at room temperature. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3-D) metallo-supramolecular architectures 1-3 based on CuII-dca-cypy systems [dca = dicyanamide, N(CN)2 -, and cypy = n-cyanopyridine (n = 4, 3, 2)], which are extended by combining metal-coordination and second-sphere hydrogen-bonded interactions, were rationally designed and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Reaction of CuII with dca and 4- or 3-cypy afforded two similar neutral one-dimensional (1-D) coordination polymers, [Cu(dca) 2(4-cypy)2]n (1) and [Cu(dca) 2(3-cypcy)2]n (2), in which the octahedral CuII centers are linked through double \u03bc1,5-dca bridges and the cypy moieties act as monodentate terminal ligands via their pyridyl nitrogen donors. The coordination chains of 1 and 2 are further cross-linked by C-H\u22efN interactions between the free nitrile N atoms of cypy and H atoms of the pyridyl ring, creating two interpenetrating 3-D networks (for 2, further weaker hydrogen-bonding interactions between the amide N atoms of dca and the H atoms in 3-cypy combined the two networks into a single net). When substituting the 4- or 3-cypy with 2-cypy, a single \u03bc1,5-dca bridged 1-D chain [Cu(dca)2(pyom)]n (3) was isolated in which the square-pyramidal CuII center is chelated to the ligand O-methyl picolinimidate (pyom), generated from 2-cypy via addition of methanol across the C\u2261N group. These 1-D chains are further cross-linked by weak Cu-N dca interactions to form corrugated 2-D (6,3) sheets, which are highly interdigitated and further expanded to result in a 3-D network through interlayer C(N)-H\u22efN interactions. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal the existence of very weak antiferromagnetic or nil interactions between the CuII centers in complexes 1-3, and the magneto-structural correlations of such \u03bc1,5-dca-Cu II 1-D systems are also discussed. \u00a9 2005 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "The reactions of CoCl 2 salt and piperazine ( L ) in the presence of different organic acid mediums afford a series of cobalt(II) complexes, the solid structures (determined by X-ray diffraction techniques) of which are controlled by the nature of the specific acid. When terephthalic acid was used, a novel mononuclear molecule [Co(H L ) 2 Cl 3 ]\u00b7Cl\u00b7(H 2 O) ( 1 ) was obtained [orthorhombic, Pnma , a =24.604(16) \u00c5, b =9.882(7) \u00c5, c =6.609(4) \u00c5, Z =4], in which the Co II center takes the unusual compressed trigonal-bipyramidal coordination geometry (CoN 2 Cl 3 ) and multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions extend this structure into a three-dimensional supramolecular network. However, with the replacement of terephthalic acid with malonic acid in the above reaction, a one-dimensional coordination polymer [Co L Cl 2 ] n ( 2 ) was obtained [monoclinic, P 2 1 / n , a =6.363(3) \u00c5, b =10.244(5) \u00c5, c =12.124(5) \u00c5, \u03b2 =103.560(8)\u00b0, Z =4], in which the tetrahedral Co II centers (CoCl 2 N 2 ) are linked by the bidentate-coordinated piperazine molecules to form a zigzag chain array and these coordination chains are further expanded to a three-dimensional hydrogen-bonding architecture. In addition, a mononuclear complex [Co(gly) 3 ]\u00b7(H 2 O) ( 3 ) [monoclinic, P 2 1 / c , a =6.261(5) \u00c5, b =14.280(9) \u00c5, c =12.182(8) \u00c5, \u03b2 =101.450(14)\u00b0, Z =4] was yielded when glycine was used in the similar procedure. A three-dimensional framework is also observed through the hydrogen-bonding interactions between [Co(gly) 3 ] moieties, in which the guest water molecules are included. These results unequivocally indicate that the nature of the organic acid templates play the key role in formation of these complexes. Keywords Crystal structure Piperazine Hydrogen bond Self-assembly Organic acid medium 1 Introduction Self-assembly processes involving metal ions and organic ligands directed by either metal coordination or hydrogen bonds have attracted much attention in the field of supramolecular chemistry and crystal engineering from the viewpoints of the development of novel functional materials with desired properties [1\u20135] . Although the general and precise principles for controlling the solid structures of the target products are still needed to be classified and established, many rational synthetic strategies have been brought forward and proved significant in the approach of the design of the metal-based coordination supramolecules. The selection of proper ligands as \u2018building blocks\u2019, such as the most common 4,4\u2032-bipyridyl-based ligands, is undoubtedly a key point in manipulating the network structures [6] , and other factors such as metal ion, counter anion, solvent, metal/ligand ratio and even pH value have also been found to highly influence the structural topologies of such coordination frameworks [7] . Recently, a series interesting coordination supramolecules, [{M(BTEC)(H 2 O) 4 }]\u00b7{H 2 L }\u00b74H 2 O] n (M=Co II , Ni II and Zn II ; BTEC=1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylate), were reported by Murugavel et al., [8] , which exhibit the anionic metal-organic and cationic organic layer alternated architecture. In these compounds, the metal centers coordinate to the BTEC molecules, and the protonated piperazine moieties act as the cation templates in the formation of the final products. Additionally, Tran Qui and Palacios have reported the crystal structure of [H 2 L ]\u00b7[CoCl 4 ]\u00b74H 2 O prepared by CoCl 2 and L in the presence of HCl [9] , which consists of a bis -protonated H 2 L cation, CoCl 4 mononuclear anionic unit and solvents, and a hydrogen-bonding three-dimensional supramolecular network is observed. To further develop such metal-based supramolecular systems, we select terephthalic acid, malonic acid or glycine (see Chart 1 ) instead of BTEC or HCl to assemble with Co II salt and piperazine. In each case, other reacting conditions are kept constant, and the only varied parameter during these processes is the organic acid medium. Our results indicate that the nature of the organic acid templates play the key role in formation of the complexes [Co(H L ) 2 Cl 3 ]\u00b7Cl\u00b7(H 2 O) ( 1 ), [Co L Cl 2 ] n ( 2 ) and [Co(gly) 3 ]\u00b7(H 2 O) ( 3 ) with different supramolecular architectures, as described in the present paper. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and general methods All reagents for synthesis and analysis were obtained commercially with analytical grade and used as received. FT-IR spectra (KBr pellets) were taken on a FT-IR 170SX (Nicolet) spectrometer.

Then, piperazine hexahydrate (116 mg, 0.6 mmol) in water (10 ml) was added slowly to the above hot solution with further stirring for 30 min, and the resultant purple solution was filtered after cooling to room temperature.

The determination of unit cell parameters and data collections were performed with Mo K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb =0.71073 \u00c5) by \u03d6 scan mode in the range of 2.64< \u03b8 <25.68\u00b0 (for 1 ), 2.63< \u03b8 <25.64\u00b0 (for 2 ) and 3.32< \u03b8 <20.35\u00b0 (for 3 ) at 293(2) K. All data were corrected by semi-empirical method using SADABS program. The program SAINT [10] was used for integration of the diffraction profiles. All structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS program of the SHELXTL-97 package and refined with SHELXL [11] . Co II centers were located from the E-maps and other non-hydrogen atoms were located in successive difference Fourier syntheses. The final refinements were performed by full matrix least-squares methods with anisotropic thermal parameters for non-hydrogen atoms on F 2 . All the hydrogen atoms were first found in difference electron density maps, and then placed in the calculated sites and included in the final refinement in the riding model approximation with displacement parameters derived from the parent atoms to which they were bonded. The refinements converged to final R =0.0385, wR =0.0799, S =1.045, ( \u0394 / \u03c3 ) max =0.002, ( \u0394 / \u03c3 ) min =0.000 (for 1 ); R =0.0420, wR =0.0791, S =1.027, ( \u0394 / \u03c3 ) max =( \u0394 / \u03c3 ) min =0.000 (for 2 ); and R =0.0575, wR =0.0907, S =0.991, ( \u0394 / \u03c3 ) max =( \u0394 / \u03c3 ) min =0.000 (for 3 ). The ratios of minimum to maximum apparent transmission are 0.7305 (for 1 ), 0.7278 (for 2 ) and 0.7843 (for 3 ), respectively. Molecular graphics were drawn with the program package XP. Further crystallographic data and experimental details for structural analyses of the three complexes are summarized in Table 1 , and selected bond lengths and angles with their estimated standard deviations for complexes 1 \u2013 3 in Tables 2\u20134 , respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Description of the crystal structures of complexes 1 \u2013 3 3.1.1 [Co(HL) 2 Cl 3 ]\u00b7Cl\u00b7(H 2 O) (1) The crystal structure of 1 consists of a discrete mononuclear [Co(H L ) 2 Cl 3 ] + cation with a symmetry mirror through Co(1)\u2013N(1)\u2013N(3)\u2013Cl(1) plane, a chloride anion and a lattice water molecule. The ORTEP view of the coordination cation in complex 1 with atom labeling is shown in Fig. 1a . The coordination geometry around the Co II center could be described as a compressed trigonal-bipyramidal generated by N(1)\u2013N(3)\u2013Cl(1)\u2013Cl(2)\u2013Cl(2A) with \u03c4 value of 0.88, which is used to describe the degree of distortion for penta-coordinated complexes ( \u03c4 =1 for an ideal trigonal-bipyramid and \u03c4 =0 for an ideal square-pyramid) [12,13] . Two nitrogen atoms of distinct piperazine rings act as the axis with the mean Co\u2013N distance of 2.195(5) \u00c5, and three chloride anions are composed of the basal plane with the mean Co\u2013N distance of 2.320(2) \u00c5 (Co II ion is deviated from this mean coordination plane by only 0.0078 \u00c5). Two protonated piperazine rings are in normal chair conformation, which are both slightly distorted from ideal (the ring torsion angles lying in the range of 51.8(6)\u201359.9(6)\u00b0), and take the monodendate coordination mode with the central Co II ion due to the protonation of one nitrogen donor. The average C\u2013C and C\u2013N bond lengths of the piperazine rings are 1.507(6) and 1.472(5) \u00c5, respectively. Analysis of the crystal packing of complex 1 in the unit cell shows that there exist multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions, resulting in a three-dimensional supramolecular network. As shown in Fig. 1b , a pair of N(2)\u2013H(2B)\u2013Cl(2) i,ii (i= x , y , z \u22121; ii= x ,\u2212 y +1/2, z \u22121) hydrogen bonds, together with the N(3)\u2013H(3C)\u2013Cl(1) iii (iii= x , y , z +1), between one protonated piperazine ring and the adjacent coordinated chloride anion link the [Co(H L ) 2 Cl 3 ] + cations to form a one-dimensional chain motif along [001] direction. Meantime, the uncoordinated Cl(3) anion acts as a three-connected node through N(1)\u2013H(1C)\u2013Cl(3) iv (iv=\u2212 x +1/2,\u2212 y +1, z +1/2), N(2)\u2013H(2A)\u2013Cl(3) v (v=\u2212 x +1/2,\u2212 y +1, z \u22121/2) and N(4)\u2013H(4B)\u2013Cl(3) vi (vi=\u2212 x ,\u2212 y +1,\u2212 z +2) interactions, linked the adjacent chains to form a two-dimensional layered architecture along (101) plane ( Fig. 1b ). In addition, the lattice water molecules in each layer form intra-layered N(4)\u2013H(4A)\u2013O(1) vii (vii=\u2212 x ,\u2212 y +1,\u2212 z +1) bonds with the adjacent piperazine rings, and further expand these layers through [010] direction to form a three-dimensional framework via two types inter-layered O(1)\u2013H(1)\u2013Cl(2) ii and O(1)\u2013H(2)\u2013Cl(2) viii (viii= x , y +1, z \u22121) interactions. For all the hydrogen bonds stated above, the N\u22efCl separations are in 3.056\u20133.402 \u00c5 range, the N\u22efO and O\u22efCl separations are 2.739 and 3.126 \u00c5, respectively; and the smallest bond angle is 135.7\u00b0, falling into the normal range of such weak hydrogen-bonding interactions [14] . 3.1.2 [CoLCl 2 ] n (2) X-ray single crystal structure determination reveals that complex 2 is a neutral one-dimensional infinite zigzag coordination chain as shown in Fig. 2a . Each Co II center coordinates to two N donors of distinct piperazine rings and two chloride anions, forming a tetrahedral coordination sphere. The CoCl 2 moiety is preserved within this complex: Co(1)\u2013Cl(1) and Co(1)\u2013Cl(2) bond distances are 2.243(2) and 2.242(2) \u00c5, respectively, accompanied by a Cl(1)\u2013Co(1)\u2013Cl(2) angle of 105.38(6)\u00b0. The piperazine rings in this structure also take the usual chair conformation, which are both slightly distorted from ideal (the ring torsion angles lying in the range of 52.5(5)\u201355.5(6)\u00b0), bridging the Co II centers via two nitrogen donors to form a one-dimensional zigzag coordination polymer along [001] direction. The average C\u2013C and C\u2013N bond lengths of the piperazine rings are 1.510(6) and 1.481(5) \u00c5, respectively, agreeing with the values in 1 . In this 1:1 ligand/metal polymeric chain, the neighboring Co(1)\u22efCo(1A) separation (bridged by piperazine ring) is 6.862 \u00c5 and the Co(1)\u22efCo(1B) distance is 12.124 \u00c5. In addition, the shortest Co\u22efCo (symmetry codes: \u2212 x +1/2, y \u22121/2, \u2212 z \u22121/2; \u2212 x +1/2, y +1/2, \u2212 z \u22121/2) distance between the adjacent chains is only 5.425 \u00c5. Analysis of the crystal packing of 2 in the unit cell indicates that four independent inter-chain N\u2013H\u22efCl hydrogen bonds link these one-dimensional coordination chains to result in a three-dimensional architecture as depicted in Fig. 2b . The N(1)\u2013H(1C) group in one piperazine ring of each coordination chain forms two N\u2013H\u22efCl hydrogen bonds with chloride anions of two adjacent distinct coordination chains: N(1)\u2013H(1C)\u22efCl(2) i (i= x \u22121, y , z ) and N(1)\u2013H(1C)\u22efCl(1) ii (ii=\u2212 x \u22121/2, y \u22121/2, \u2212 z +3/2). Meantime, the N(2)\u2013H(2C) group in the other piperazine ring of each coordination chain also forms two N\u2013H\u22efCl hydrogen bonds, however, with chloride anions of one adjacent coordination chain: N(2)\u2013H(2C)\u22efCl(2) iii and N(2)\u2013H(2C)\u22efCl(1) iii (iii=\u2212 x +1/2, y \u22121/2,\u2212 z +3/2). All the N\u22efCl separations are in 3.436\u20133.627 \u00c5 range with H\u22efCl separations in 2.701\u20132.939 \u00c5 region, respectively; and the smallest bond angle is 133.5\u00b0, falling into the normal range of such weak hydrogen-bonding interactions [14] . 3.1.3 [Co(gly) 3 ]\u00b7(H 2 O) (3) The crystal structure of compound 3 consists of one isolated neutral [Co(gly) 3 ] unit and a lattice water molecule. Two crystallography isomers (monoclinic, P 2 1 / n , a =13.860(3) \u00c5, b =13.153(3) \u00c5, c =13.996(3) \u00c5, \u03b2 =112.88(1)\u00b0, Z =8; orthorhombic, Pna 2 1 , a =15.331(2) \u00c5, b =13.205(2) \u00c5, c =11.606(2) \u00c5, Z =8) of a very similar compound [Co(gly) 3 ]\u00b7(H 2 O) 2 were reported previously [15,16] . The [Co(gly) 3 ] molecule with atom numbering scheme is presented in Fig. 3a . The Co II center coordinates to three chelated gly ligands (each with one N donor of the \u2013NH 2 group and one O atom of the monodendate \u2013COO \u2212 group), forming a distorted octahedral stereochemistry. The average Co\u2013N and Co\u2013O distances are 1.935(5) and 1.916(4) \u00c5, respectively, which are comparable to other similar compounds [15\u201317] . Analysis of the crystal packing of 3 in the unit cell indicates the existence of six intermolecular N\u2013H\u22efO hydrogen bonds between the \u2013NH 2 and \u2013COO \u2212 groups of the gly molecules: N(1)\u2013H(1A)\u22efO(5) i (i= x +1, y , z ), N(1)\u2013H(1A)\u22efO(2) ii (ii= x ,\u2212 y +1/2, z \u22121/2), N(1)\u2013H(1B)\u22efO(4) iii (ii=\u2212 x +1,\u2212 y +1,\u2212 z +1), N(2)\u2013H(2A)\u22efO(1) ii , N(2)\u2013H(2B)\u22efO(2) iv (iv= x \u22121,\u2212 y +1/2, z \u22121/2) and N(3)\u2013H(3B)\u22efO(6) i , resulting in a three-dimensional supramolecular network with cavities along [100] direction as depicted in Fig. 3b . The lattice water molecules are included in these channels with the formation of N(3)\u2013H(3A)\u22efO(7) ii , O(7)\u2013H(7A)\u22efO(3) and O(7)\u2013H(7B)\u22efO(6) v (v=\u2212 x , y +1/2,\u2212 z +3/2) hydrogen bonds with the host framework, which further stabilize this structure. All the N(O)\u22efO separations are in 2.774\u20133.055 \u00c5 range with H\u22efO separations in 2.074\u20132.310 \u00c5 region, respectively; and the smallest bond angle is 134.3\u00b0, falling into the normal range of such weak hydrogen-bonding interactions [14] . 3.2 Role of the organic acid in the self-assembly processes of complexes 1 \u2013 3 From above descriptions, the choice of different organic acids is clearly critical in determining the molecular structures of the resultant complexes 1 \u2013 3 . As stated in Section 1 , when 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylate or HCl was used in the self-assemblies process, the piperazine rings are bis -protonated and not involve in the coordination to the metal center. In this study, the nature of the acids is the underlying reason behind the differences in the structures of this series of Co II complexes. In complex 1 , the terephthalic acid causes the mono-protonation of the piperazine rings, and thus, prevents their further coordination with the Co II center to form a mononuclear complex. For complex 2 , the free piperazine rings bridge the Co II centers to form a one-dimensional coordination polymer. For compound 3 , the glycine moieties directly chelated with the Co II center to form a mononuclear molecule and the piperazine ring does not take part in the coordination. Additionally, a mononuclear Co II complex with N -methylpiperazine was reported recently [18] . Thus, direct coordination to metal centers is not the only role of the acids, and indeed extremely subtle templating effects to change the coordination modes of piperazine have also been observed in this study. 4 Conclusion and comments A series of Co II complexes 1 \u2013 3 have been prepared by means of self-assemblies of CoCl 2 , piperazine and different organic acids, and structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction analyses. The resultant structures of these complexes are profoundly influenced by the organic acids, and different hydrogen-bonding supramoleclar architectures are observed, which can be utilized to advantage in supramolecular chemistry and crystal engineering. Further studies of the self-assemblies of such systems with other organic acids are under way in our laboratory. 4.1 Supplementary materials Crystallographic data for the crystal structures reported in this paper have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center (CCDC Nos. 225434/35/36).

        "abstract": "Two new flexible dipyridyl building blocks, N,N\u2032-bis(4-picolinoyl) hydrazine (4-bph) and its N-orientation isomer N,N\u2032-bis(3-picolinoyl) hydrazine (3-bph), have been synthesized as versatile cocrystallizing agents and introduced into the reactions with pyromellitic acid (H4BTA) and fumaric acid (H2Fa). Hydrogen-bonded directed assemblies of two hydrates of bphs and four binary cocrystals were validated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. With the presence of the reliable hydrogen-bonding donor/acceptor(s) of bph, the crystalline lattices of [4-bph]\u00b72H 2O (1) and [3-bph]\u00b72H2O (4) are managed by N-H\u22efOwater and O-H\u22efOcarbonyl to afford one-dimensional (1D) arrays, which are further extended to distinct three-dimensional (3D) (for 1) and two-dimensional (2D) (for 4) networks via O-H\u22efNpyridyl interactions. While for the concomitant polymorphs [(H2BTA)\u00b7(H2-4-bph)] (2 and 3), charge-assistant bifurcated N-H\u22efO bonds do favor 1D acid-base hydrogen-bonding tapes, which are interlinked to result in a 2D layer in 2 and a 3D network in 3 through the competition of O-H\u22efOcarbonyl and O-H\u22efOcarbonyl forces. [(H3-BTA)2\u00b7 (H2-3-bph)]\u00b74H2O (5) is also a charge-transfer organic salt with a 2D bilayered array. Proton transfer from weak H 2Fa to 3-bph is not observed, and this leads to the formation of a binary neutral cocrystal [(H2Fa)\u00b7(3-bph)] (6), in which the 2D undulating herringbone pattern is constructed via the expected carboxylpyridyl heterosynthon and amide-amide homosynthon. \u00a9 2006 American Chemical Society.",

Reaction of AgPF6 or AgClO4\u00b7H2O and L1 in CH 3OH/CHCl3 medium afforded a unique two-dimensional coordination polymer {[Ag(L1)](PF6)}\u221e (1) or {[Ag(L1)](ClO4)}\u221e (2) with (2/4,3) topology.

Complex 1 crystallizes in the tetragonal I4(1)/a space group (a = b = 13.462(2) A, c = 46.47(1) A, Z = 8), complex 2 in the orthorhombic Pna2(1) space group (a = 6.379(2) A, b = 10.060(3) A, c = 27.232(9) A, Z = 4), and complex 3 in the orthorhombic P2(1)2(1)2(1) space group (a = 5.510(2) A, b = 10.576(4) A, c = 28.34(1) A, Z = 4). Different polymeric frameworks are obtained by only varying the counterions. These include the 2-fold interpenetrated diamondoid structure of 1, the acentric alpha-Po network of 2, and the chiral open framework of 3 with (6(3)).(6(9).8) topology. The interesting anion-exchange, porous, and magnetic properties of these coordination supramolecules have been investigated in detail.",

The structures of the two boxlike dinuclear complexes with L(1) and L(2) and two chemically the same but differently crystallized one-dimensional zigzag chain coordination polymers also consisting of boxlike dinuclear subunits have been elucidated by X-ray analysis.

The structures of the dinuclear complexes 1 and 2 are similar to each other, with the two intramolecular Ag(I) centers of each complex being spanned by two ligands thus forming a unique boxlike cyclic dimer. In 1, each Ag(I) center is four-coordinated by three nitrogen atoms of two L(1) ligands and a CH(3)CN nitrogen donor, taking a distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry. The coordination environment of Ag(I) in 2 is similar to that in 1, except the formation of an additional weak coordination bond with the oxygen atom of the methoxy group of L(2). The structures of 3a,b are very similar to each other, except for the stacking patterns in the crystal lattices, and the cyclic boxlike dinuclear unit, which is similar to the structure of 1, constitutes the fundamental building block to form the one-dimensional zigzag chain structures due to the \"end-on\" nature of L(3). 1-3 exhibit metal-perturbed intraligand transitions in solution in 360-390 nm regions. Cyclic voltammetric studies of these complexes show the presence of reduction peak at approximately -0.5 V vs Fc(+/0). In the solid state at 77 K, they exhibit broad emission that may be assignable to originate from the metal-perturbed intraligand transitions.",

        "abstract": "Under different solvothermal reaction conditions I (60 \u00b0C for 48 h) and II (140 \u00b0C for 72 h), the dipyrazinyl compounds bearing oxadiazole and triazole spacers, that is, 2,5-bis(2-pyrazinyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (L1) and 4-amino-3,5-bis(2-pyrazinyl)-1,2,4-triazole (L2), may suffer reversible conversions in the presence of certain metal salts. Other related derivatives such as 3,5-bis(2-pyrazinyl)-1,2,4-triazole-4-yl-N-pyrazinamide (HL4) and pyrazine-2-carboxylic acid (HL0) can also be (in situ) obtained from L1 and L2, respectively, under conditions I and II. Beyond this, N,N\u2032-bis(2-pyrazineamide) (H 2L3) can be in situ afforded from both precursors L 1 and L2, and thus, may be considered as the potential intermediate during the interconversions. The possible mechanisms and influence factors of these reactions have also been established based on the experimental results. As a result, a variety of crystalline materials (co-crystals and coordination complexes) with attractive supramolecular architectures have been isolated by regulating the reaction conditions well (reaction temperature, metal ion, and even inorganic counteranion). \u00a9 2010 American Chemical Society.",

Keywords Bis(pyrazol-1-yl)methane Heteroscorpionate ligand Tungsten carbonyl Iron carbonyl Cobalt complex 1 Introduction In recent years, poly(pyrazol-1-yl)alkane [1,2] , especially bis(pyrazol-1-yl)methane [3] , has been performing as one of the most popular nitrogen-containing donor ligands, and its coordination chemistry towards main group and transition metals has been extensively studied. Recently, the modification of bis(pyrazol-1-yl)methane by organic functional groups on the bridging carbon atom to form novel heteroscorpionate ligands has also drawn extensive attention [3\u20138] . These intriguing heteroscorpionate ligands usually have asymmetric N 2 O, N 2 S, N 3 S, or N 3 O coordination environments, which render them the potential to form novel complexes with various main group and transition metals. In addition, the modification of bis(pyrazol-1-yl)methanes by organometallic groups has also successfully broadened the scope of application of these novel ligands [9\u201311] . Our recent investigations on bis(pyrazol-1-yl)methane indicate that the modification of this ligand with organotin groups on the methine carbon atom can provide unusual reactivity [12,13] . For example, the reaction of triarylstannyl-bis(pyrazol-1-yl)methane with W(CO) 5 THF results in oxidative addition of the Sn\u2013C sp 3 bond to the tungsten(0) atom to yield novel four-membered metallacyclic complexes [12] . As part of our ongoing interest in functionalized bis(pyrazol-1-yl)methane ligands, we continue our investigation of the modification of bis(pyrazol-1-yl)methane by introducing heteroatoms on the methine carbon to form novel heteroscorpionate ligands. Herein we report the modification of bis(pyrazol-1-yl)methane by phenyl isothiocyanate and CS 2 on the bridging carbon atom to yield N -phenyl-2,2-bis(pyrazol-1-yl)thioacetamide and bis(pyrazol-1-yl)dithioacetate, which have the attractive character of being able to act as a monodentate, bidentate, or tridentate ligand, depending on different metal atoms. Very recently, the modification of bis(pyrazol-1-yl)methane by enantiopure isocyanate and isothiocyanate fragments has been reported [14,15] . 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Synthesis of bis(pyrazol-1-yl)thioacetamide The modification of bis(pyrazol-1-yl)methane by phenyl isothiocyanate on the methine carbon is easily carried out. Treatment of the bis(pyrazol-1-yl)methide anion [16] , prepared in situ by the reaction of bis(pyrazol-1-yl)methane with n -BuLi, with phenyl isothiocyanate, and subsequently with water gives ligands 1 and 2 in reasonable yields, as shown in Scheme 1 , which have been characterized by NMR. The proton signal of CH group in 1 (7.16 ppm) and 2 (7.13 ppm), respectively, markedly shifts to lower field than that of the methylene group in bis(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)methane (5.94 ppm), possibly due to the deshielding effect by the C S bond. In addition, the 13 C NMR signal of C S occurs at 188.03 ppm for 1 and 189.63 ppm for 2 , respectively. These two new multidetate ligands are expected to exhibit intriguing coordination chemistry owing to the existence of both sulfur and nitrogen atoms, which have different electron-donating ability. 2.2 Reaction of bis(pyrazol-1-yl)thioacetamide with W(CO) 6 Upon irradiation of the solution of ligand 1 or 2 and W(CO) 6 in THF at room temperature, or treatment of ligand 1 or 2 with W(CO) 5 THF in refluxing THF, complexes 3 and 4 are obtained ( Scheme 1 ), which are characterized by NMR, IR spectra, and elemental analyses. The IR spectra of complexes 3 and 4 show a pattern of \u03bd CO bands that is consistent with the W(CO) 5 fragment, such as a \u03bd CO band observed at ca . 2071 cm \u22121 , corresponding to the A 1eq mode for the pseudo C 4 v metal center in a metal pentacarbonyl moiety [17\u201319] . The 13 C NMR spectrum of 3 also supports the proposed structure, which clearly shows two signals of the carbonyl carbon atoms with ca . a 1:4 intensity ratio. The structure of complex 3 has also been confirmed by crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, and presented in Fig. 1 , which clearly manifests that N -phenyl-2,2-bis(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)thioacetamide acts as a monodentate ligand by the sulfur atom only, and the pyrazolyl nitrogen atoms do not take part in the coordination to the metal. The tungsten atom is six-coordinate with a slightly distorted octahedral coordination geometry. The W\u2013S (2.578(1) \u00c5) and C S (1.675(3) \u00c5) distances are comparable to those in other thiocarbonyl W(0) complexes (such as 2.5687(9) \u00c5 for W\u2013S and 1.708(4) \u00c5 for C S in W(CO) 5 (DTTT), DTTT = 3,5-dimethyl-tetrahydro-2 H -1,3,5-thiadiazine-2-thione) [19] . An intramolecular hydrogen bonding interaction has been observed between the N(5)\u2013H group and the N(2) atom. The hydrogen bond N(5)\u2013H\u22efN(2) distance is 2.765(4) \u00c5, and the angle of \u2220N\u2013H\u22efN is 143.30(5)\u00b0. It is noteworthy that one carbonyl C(3)O(3) is significantly distorted with the angle of \u2220W(1)\u2013C(3)\u2013O(3) of 173.3(3)\u00b0, indicating the presence of the steric repulsion between the ligand and carbonyl. 2.3 Reaction of bis(pyrazol-1-yl)thioacetamide with Fe(CO) 5 Upon irradiation of ligands 1 and 2 with Fe(CO) 5 under the similar experimental conditions to those for 1 and 2 with W(CO) 6 , novel complexes 5 and 6 are yielded, which are air-stable in the solid state and even their solution can be manipulated in air without notable decomposition. Their proton signals of the CH groups (6.44 ppm in 5 and 6.43 ppm in 6 , respectively) are considerably shifted to higher field than those (7.13\u20137.16 ppm) in free ligands 1 and 2 as well as complexes 3 and 4 . Furthermore, their proton signals of the NH groups (5.15 ppm in 5 and 5.05 ppm in 6 , respectively) are also markedly upfield shifted, compared with those in free ligands 1 and 2 (12.47 ppm), possibly due to the disappearance of the hydrogen bonds in complexes. It is known that thioamide has variable coordination modes depending on different metals. For example, it can act as a monodentate ligand by the sulfur atom [19\u201321] , as in complex 3 , as well as a chelating bidentate ligand by both sulfur and nitrogen atoms [22] . Although iron(0) carbonyl complexes of thiocarbamoyls [23,24] or thioamides [25,26] have been reported in literatures, neutral thioamides bonded to the iron(0) atom by the C S \u03c0-bond in an \u03b7 2 -C,S fashion are still rare [26] . Herein, complex 5 provides an interesting case. Such coordination mode is consistent with the results of NMR spectra. For example, two sets of 1 H and 13 C NMR signals corresponding to two inequivalent pyrazolyl ligands have been observed in complexes 5 and 6 . In addition, the 13 C NMR signals of the thiocarbonyl groups in these two complexes are also markedly shifted to higher field, compared with those in free ligands and complexes 3 and 4 . The molecular structure of complex 5 has been confirmed by crystal X-ray diffraction analysis as shown in Fig. 2 . Selected bond distances and angles are listed in Table 1 . As seen in Fig. 2 , N -phenyl-2,2-bis(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)thioacetamide acts as a neutral bidentate \u03ba 2 -(\u03c0,N) ligand through only one pyrazolyl nitrogen atom and the C S \u03c0-bond, which is side-on bonded to the iron atom in an \u03b7 2 -C,S fashion. The iron atom has a distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry with one carbon atom and one nitrogen atom occupying the axial positions. The axial angle of \u2220C(1)\u2013Fe(1)\u2013N(4) is 171.71(9)\u00b0. The Fe\u2013S (2.275(6) \u00c5) and Fe\u2013C(10) (2.015(2) \u00c5) distances are comparable to those in \u03c0 bonded thio ester derivatives of iron(0) carbonyl complexes (such as 2.2810(9) \u00c5 for Fe\u2013S and 1.987(3) \u00c5 for Fe\u2013C in [HC(S)OEt] 2 Fe 2 (CO) 6 ) [27] . The C S (1.757(2) \u00c5) and C(S)\u2013N (1.428(3) \u00c5) bond distances are longer than those in 3 (1.675(3) \u00c5 for C S and 1.317(3) \u00c5 for C(S)\u2013N, respectively), indicating that the \u03c0 coordination to the iron atom weakens the double bond character of the C S. 2.4 Synthesis of cobalt complex The reaction of PhNCS(Li)CH(3,5-Me 2 Pz) 2 with Co(ClO 4 ) 2 \u00b7 6H 2 O in CH 3 OH solution yields Co(III) complex 7 . Its IR spectrum displays the characteristic strong and broad band at 3423.1 cm \u22121 of O\u2013H stretching vibration, originating from the water in the lattice. The strong peak at 1562.1 cm \u22121 is attributed to the C N stretching vibration. In addition, the strong peak near 1090 cm \u22121 indicates the presence of typical non-coordinate perchlorate ion [28] . The molecular structure of complex 7 has been confirmed by crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, and the structure of its cation is presented in Fig. 3 . In this complex, the cobalt atom is octahedrally coordinated by four pyrazolyl nitrogen atoms and two sulfur atoms, and N -phenyl-2,2-bis(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)thioacetamide acts as a tridentate monoanionic \u03ba 3 -(N,N,S) chelating ligand. Two sulfur atoms lie in a cis -position with the bite angle of \u2220S\u2013Co\u2013S (89.2(1)\u00b0). The average Co\u2013S (2.262 (1) \u00c5) and Co\u2013N (1.970(4) \u00c5) distances are comparable to those in related octahedral cobalt(III) complexes [29\u201332] . The N(5)\u2013C(7) (1.287(6) \u00c5) and N(10)\u2013C(25) (1.263(6) \u00c5) distances are considerably shorter than the N(5)\u2013C(6) (1.433(7) \u00c5) and N(10)\u2013C(24) (1.423(7)\u00c5) distances, but similar to the C N distance of the \u2013C(S \u2212 ) N\u2013 fragment in complexes [Cp(CH 3 )C N\u2013N C(S)C 4 H 3 O]W(CO) 3 SnCl 2 (1.298(6) \u00c5) and [Cp(CH 3 )C N\u2013N C(S)C 4 H 3 S]Mo(CO) 3 SnCl 2 (1.286(8) \u00c5) [33] , indicating the C N double bond character of these two bonds. 2.5 Synthesis of ethyl 2,2-bis(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)dithioacetate and its reaction with Fe(CO) 5 Ethyl 2,2-bis(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)dithioacetate ( 8 ) can be easily obtained by the reaction of 2,2-bis(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)dithioacetate anion [34] with ethyl iodide ( Scheme 2 ). Treatment of this ligand with Fe(CO) 5 under UV irradiation gives complex 9 , which has been characterized by NMR. The proton signal of CH group in 9 (6.22 ppm) is considerably shifted to higher field than that in free ligand 8 (7.07 ppm), but similar with those in complexes 5 (6.44 ppm) and 6 (6.43 ppm), respectively. In addition, two sets of 1 H and 13 C NMR signals corresponding to two inequivalent pyrazolyl ligands have been observed in complex 9 . These results are consistent with the \u03ba 2 -(\u03c0,N) coordination mode of ligand 8 in this complex. The structure of complex 9 has also been confirmed by crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, which consists of two crystallography independent molecules. The two molecules are essentially the same, only slightly different in bond distances and angles. One of them is presented in Fig. 4 , and selected bond distances and angles are listed in Table 1 . Similar with N -phenyl-2,2-bis(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)thioacetamide ligand in complex 7 , ethyl 2,2-bis(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)dithioacetate also acts as a neutral bidentate \u03ba 2 -(\u03c0,N) ligand through only one pyrazolyl nitrogen atom and the C S \u03c0-bond, which is side-on bonded to the iron atom in an \u03b7 2 -C,S fashion. The axial angle of \u2220C(3)\u2013Fe(1)\u2013N(1) (173.3(1)\u00b0) is slightly bigger than the corresponding angle of \u2220C(1)\u2013Fe(1)\u2013N(4) (171.71(9)\u00b0) in complex 7 . In addition, the C S (C(7)\u2013S(1) 1.740(3) \u00c5) is comparable to that in complex 7 (1.757(2) \u00c5), but still slightly longer than that in complex 3 (1.675(3) \u00c5). Other structural parameters, such as the Fe\u2013S distances (2.2806(9) \u00c5 in complex 9 and 2.275(6) \u00c5 in complex 7 ) and Fe\u2013C distances (Fe(1)\u2013C(7) 2.042(3) \u00c5 in complex 9 ) and Fe\u2013C(10) (2.015(2) \u00c5 in complex 7 ), are very similar in complexes 9 and 7 . In summary, new heteroscorpionate ligands, N -phenyl-2,2-bis(pyrazol-1-yl)thioacetamides and ethyl 2,2-bis(pyrazol-1-yl)dithioacetate, have been successfully prepared. N -phenyl-2,2-bis(pyrazol-1-yl)thioacetamides can coordinate in three different ways, as monodentate ligand by the sulfur atom to carbonyl tungsten complexes, as neutral \u03ba 2 -(\u03c0,N) bidentate ligand by one pyrazolyl nitrogen atom and the C S \u03c0-bond to carbonyl iron complexes, and as tridentate monoanionic \u03ba 3 -(N,N,S) chelating ligand by two pyrazolyl nitrogen atoms and the sulfur atom to cobalt(III) complexes. Ethyl 2,2-bis(pyrazol-1-yl)dithioacetate also acts as a neutral \u03ba 2 -(\u03c0,N) bidentate ligand when reacts with carbonyl iron. 3 Experimental Solvents were dried by standard methods and distilled prior to use. All reactions were carried out under an argon atmosphere using standard Schlenk and Cannula techniques. NMR spectra ( 1 H and 13 C) were recorded on a Bruker AV300 spectrometer, and the chemical shifts were reported in ppm with respect to reference standards (internal SiMe 4 for 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectra) using CDCl 3 as solvent unless otherwise noted. IR spectral data were obtained from a Bruker Equinox55 spectrometer in KBr pellets or Nujol mulls. Elemental analyses were carried out on an Elementar Vairo EL analyzer. Melting points were reported with a X-4 digital melting-point apparatus and were uncorrected. 3.1 Preparation of PhHNCSCH(3,5-Me 2 Pz) 2 ( 1 ) To a solution of bis(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)methane (0.408 g, 2 mmol) in THF (30 ml) was added a hexane solution of n -BuLi (2 M, 1.0 ml) at \u221270 \u00b0C, and the mixture was stirred for 1 h at that temperature. To the mixture was added phenyl isothiocyanate (0.24 ml, 2 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at \u221270 \u00b0C for 1 h, and allowed to slowly reach room temperature and stirred overnight. The solvent was removed under a reduced pressure, and the residual solid was washed with hexane and dried in vacuo to yield PhNCS(Li)CH(3,5-Me 2 Pz) 2 as a slightly yellow solid. After water (1 ml) was added to this solid, CH 2 Cl 2 (20 ml) was used to extract this solid. The extracted solution was passed through a short silica column to give a yellow solution. After the solvent was removed, PhHNCSCH(3,5-Me 2 Pz) 2 ( 1 ) (0.44 g) was obtained as a yellow solid.

The solution of W(CO) 6 or Fe(CO) 5 (0.3 mmol) and ligand 1 or 2 (0.3 mmol) dissolved in THF (30 ml) was irradiated with a 300 W high-pressure mercury lamp for 10 h at room temperature. After the reaction completed, the solvent was removed in vacuo , and the residual was purified by column chromatography on silica using CH 2 Cl 2 /hexane (v/v = 1:1) as eluent. The red or yellow eluent was concentrated to dryness under vacuum, and the residual was recrystallized from CH 2 Cl 2 /hexane to give complexes 3 \u2013 6 . 3.3.1 PhHNCSCH(3,5-Me 2 Pz) 2 W(CO) 5 ( 3 ) This complex was obtained by the reaction of W(CO) 6 with ligand 1 as a orange-red crystal.

To the mixture was added carbon disulfide (0.12 ml, 2 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at \u221270 \u00b0C for 1 h, and allowed to slowly reach room temperature and stirred continuously for 2 h. Then, ethyl iodide (0.16 ml, 2 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred for 8 h at room temperature. The solvent was removed under a reduced pressure, and the residual solid was dissolved in CH 2 Cl 2 (10 ml). The solution was passed through a short silica column to give a red solution. After the solvent was removed again, the residual solid was washed with hexane to give 0.26 g of 8 as orange-yellow crystals. Yield: 40%, mp 103\u2013105 \u00b0C. 1 H NMR: \u03b4 7.07 (s, 1H, C H ), 5.82 (s, 2H, H 4 of pyrazole ring), 3.17 (q, 2H, CH 3 C H 2 ), 2.22, 2.18 (s, s, 6H, 6H, C H 3 ), 1.26 (t, 3H, C H 3 CH 2 ). 13 C NMR: \u03b4 226.14 ( C S), 149.18, 141.82 (3- or 5-position carbon of pyrazole ring), 107.38 (4-position carbon of pyrazole ring), 81.90 ( C H), 31.70 (CH 3 C H 2 ), 13.90 ( C H 3 CH 2 ), 12.09, 11.86 (3- or 5- C H 3 ). Anal. Calc. for C 14 H 20 N 4 S 2 : C, 54.51; H, 6.54; N, 18.16. Found: C, 54.26; H, 6.72; N, 18.05%. 3.6 Reaction of ligand 8 with Fe(CO) 5 This reaction was carried out similarly as described above for the reaction of ligand 1 or 2 with Fe(CO) 5 . After the reaction completed, the solvent was removed in vacuo , and the residual was purified by column chromatography on silica using CH 2 Cl 2 /hexane (v/v = 1:1) as eluent. The red eluent was concentrated to dryness under vacuum, and the residual was recrystallized from CH 2 Cl 2 /hexane to give EtSCSCH(3,5-Me 2 Pz) 2 Fe(CO) 3 ( 9 ) as a red crystal. Yield: 65%. 1 H NMR: 6.22 (s, 1H, C H ), 5.84, 5.72 (s, s, 1H, 1H, H 4 of pyrazole ring), 2.56 (m, 5H, C H 3 and C H 2 CH 3 ), 2.36, 2.10, 1.90 (s, s, s, 3H, 3H, 3H, C H 3 ), 1.08 (t, 3H, CH 2 C H 3 ). 13 C NMR: \u03b4 208.93, 208.63, 206.68 ( C O), 151.24, 148.70, 142.55, 140.05 (3- or 5-position carbon of pyrazole ring), 108.84, 105.62 (4-position carbon of pyrazole ring), 82.85 ( C H), 32.34 (CH 3 C H 2 ), 15.74 ( C H 3 CH 2 ), 14.21, 13.72, 11.71, 11.54 (3- or 5- C H 3 ). The carbon of thiocarbonyl group was not observed possibly owing to low solubility and low sensitivity of carbonyl carbon. IR (KBr, cm \u22121 ): \u03bd CO = 2069.0 (vs), 2003.7 (vs), 1990.4 (vs). Anal. Calc. for C 17 H 20 FeN 4 O 3 S 2 : C, 45.54; H, 4.50; N, 12.50. Found: C, 45.51; H, 4.62; N, 12.76%. 3.7 X-ray crystallography Crystals of complexes 3 , 5 , and 9 suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained by slow evaporating their CH 2 Cl 2 /hexane solutions at 4 \u00b0C, while crystals of complex 7 were obtained by slowly placing the solution of PhNCS(Li)CH(3,5-Me 2 Pz) 2 in CH 3 OH over the solution of Co(ClO 4 ) 2 \u00b7 6H 2 O in the same solvent. Complex 7 had water of crystallization, which was disordered. The site occupation factor of this disordered oxygen atom was adjusted (0.5) to give reasonable thermal parameters. Intensity data were collected on a Bruker SMART CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5) using the \u03c9 /2 \u03b8 scan technique, and a semi-empirical absorption correction was applied for all complexes. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F 2 . All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. A summary of the fundamental crystal data for 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9 is listed in Table 2 .

        "title": "Varying Coordination Modes and Magnetic Properties of Copper(II) Complexes with Diazamesocyclic Ligands by Altering Additional Donor Pendants on 1,5-Diazacyclooctane",
        "abstract": "A series of new diazamesocyclic ligands based on a diazamesocycle, 1,5-diazacyclooctane (DACO), functionalized by additional donor groups--1,5-bis(N-1-methylimidazol-2-ylmethyl)-1,5- diazacyclooctane (L1), 1-(2-hydroxybenzyl)-1,5-diazacyclooctane (HL2), 1,5-bis(2-hydroxybenzyl)-1,5-diazacyclooctane (H2L3), and 1-(N-1-methylimidazol-2-ylmethyl)-1,5-diazacyclooctane (L4)--and their Cu(II) complexes have been synthesized and characterized. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of the four Cu(II) complexes revealed that L1 forms a five-coordinate mononuclear complex, HL2 a N3- mu-bridged binuclear complex, H2L3 an oxygen mu-bridged trinuclear complex, and L4 a one-dimensional zigzag coordination polymeric complex with Cu(II). [CuL1ClO4](ClO4) (I): a = 12.194(2) A, b = 13.351(3) A, c = 14.473(3) A, beta = 107.10(3) degrees, Z = 4.

[Cu3(L3)2Cl2] (III): a = 10.7296(13) A, b = 13.7707(17) A, c = 13.5523(17) A, beta = 106.350(3) degrees, Z = 2. ([CuL4Cl]2ClO4) infinity (IV): a = 7.279(1) A, b = 23.695(5) A, c = 19.308(4) A, beta = 100.28(3) degrees, Z = 8. All four complexes crystallize in the monoclinic crystal system with the P2(1)/c space group, and each Cu(II) center coordinated with DACO is pentacoordinated with a distorted square-pyramidal or trigonal-bipyrimidal coordination environment. In complex IV, the binuclear cation unit [CuL4Cl]2(2+) constitutes the fundamental building block of an infinite alternating zigzag chain structure, and the binuclear unit contains two types of geometries around the Cu(II) centers: the Cu(1) center is a distorted square-pyramidal environment, while the Cu(2) is a distorted trigonal-bipyramidal coordination environment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Cu(II) complex of a diazamesocyclic ligand with an infinite polymeric structure. The magnetic properties of complexes II, III, and IV have been investigated by variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements in the solid state. The obtained parameters are 2J = 2.06 cm-1 (II), -345.56 cm-1 (III), and -2.60 cm-1 (IV), which differ greatly from ferromagnetic to weak and strong antiferromagnetic coupling. These results unequivocally indicate that the nature of the pendant arms is a key factor governing the structure and properties of the complexes; therefore, the coordination modes and properties of the metal complexes of a diazamesocycle can be controlled by altering the pendant donors on it. Magneto-structural correlation has been precisely analyzed, and the solution properties of these complexes have also been described.",

        "abstract": "The perchlorate salt of diprotonated 5,8-dimethoxy-2,3-bis(2-pyridyl)quinoxaline, [C20H18N4O2]\u00b7(ClO4)2 \u00b7(H2O)2 (1), has been prepared and characterized by 1H NMR, IR, UV\u2013Vis, and elemental analysis, and established by X-ray diffraction technique. In the crystal structure of the title compound, two pyridinio rings form dihedral angles of 38.7(6)\u00b0 and 26.5(5)\u00b0 with the mean quinoxaline plane, and a dihedral angle of 52.7(6)\u00b0 with each other. It is unexpected that the favorite orientation of two protonated pyridyl rings is such that their nitrogen donors are opposite to each other (trans\u2013trans configuration). The most striking feature of this structure resides in the fact that numerous hydrogen-bonding interactions are observed, resulting in a novel double-chain supramolecular architecture along crystallographic [111] direction. There exist significant face-to-face p\u2013p stacking interactions between the interchain neighboring pyridinio rings, which may further stabilize this structure.",

X-ray single-crystal diffraction of 3-bpo ( 1 ) suggests that 1D infinite tape is formed via weak C\u2013H\u22efN interactions. With regard to pseudopolymorphs 2 and 3 , similar 1D acid\u2013base chains are generated through hard O\u2013H\u22efN hydrogen bonds, which however, adopt distinct 3D lattice packing. Significantly, three typical conformations of 3-bpo are observed in the structures of 1 \u2013 3 to meet the requirements of the formation of different hydrogen-bonding patterns.",

        "title": "From discrete metallacycle, cage to infinite chain: tuning the coordination frameworks by variation of the metal center or ligand functionality",
        "abstract": "Self-assembly of the angular dipyridyl-type ligand 2,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole ( L 1 ) with Cu II (BF 4 ) 2 or Cu I (ClO 4 ) salt affords a bimetallic macrocyclic compound [Cu 2 ( L 1 ) 2 (H 2 O) 6 ](BF 4 ) 4 \u00b7 (H 2 O) 3 \u00b7 (CH 3 OH) 0.5 ( 1 ) (similar to its Cu II (ClO 4 ) 2 complex) or a novel trigonal\u2013prismatic cage-shape species [(H 2 O) \u2282 Cu 2 ( L 1 ) 3 (CH 3 CN) 2 ](ClO 4 ) 2 ( 2 ), respectively. However, substituting L 1 with its analogous 2,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole ( L 2 ) to react with Cu I (BF 4 ) yields a 1-D infinite chain array {[Cu( L 2 ) 2 (CH 3 CN)](BF 4 ) \u00b7 (H 2 O) 1.5 } n ( 3 ), being similar to its Cu I (ClO 4 ) compound. These results unequivocally suggest that the nature of the metal center and ligand functionality play the key role in formation of the coordination supramolecular frameworks of 1 \u2013 3 . Keywords Self-assembly Crystal structure Metal-organic framework Coordination polymer Metallacyclophane Cage-like complex The metal-ligand coordination strength has now been a well-known tool to construct discrete supermolecules, such as macrocycle, cage, square, helicate etc. and one- to three-dimensional (3-D) infinite networks (coordination polymers) with fascinating topologies and potential applications [1\u20136] . Of further importance, self-assembly process via such driving force has proven to be a quite effective and facile synthetic strategy in creating the products with desired structures and functions, by appropriate choice of the pre-designed organic ligands (building blocks) with various backbone and connectivity information, and the metal centers (nodes) with different coordination preferences [7\u20139] . Recently, we have initially investigated the self-assemblies between the transition metal ion and the angular bent dipyridyl-type ligand containing oxadiazole spacer, such as 2,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole ( L 1 ) and 2,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole ( L 2 ) under appropriate conditions, and a variety of discrete and infinite coordination supermolecules or polymers were successfully achieved [10\u201315] . In order to further understand the role controlling the assemblies for such system, herein, we will report our recent results concerning this interesting program, including three new compounds with quite different coordination frameworks self-assembled from metal ion (Cu II or Cu I ) and such bridging ligand (see Scheme 1 , anion = BF 4 - or ClO 4 - ), that is, rectangular metallacycle [Cu 2 ( L 1 ) 2 (H 2 O) 6 ](BF 4 ) 4 \u00b7 (H 2 O) 3 \u00b7 (CH 3 OH) 0.5 ( 1 ), trigonal prism [(H 2 O) \u2282 Cu 2 ( L 1 ) 3 (CH 3 CN) 2 ] (ClO 4 ) 2 ( 2 ) and 1-D comb-shape infinite chain {[Cu( L 2 ) 2 (CH 3 CN)](BF 4 ) \u00b7 (H 2 O) 1.5 } n ( 3 ). Complex 2 represents an unprecedented structural motif based on such building blocks. Complex 1 [16] was synthesized by the reaction of Cu(BF 4 ) 2 \u00b7 x H 2 O and L 1 in CH 3 OH/H 2 O medium with 1:1 molar ratio, giving large block dark-blue crystals in 78% yield during slow evaporation of the solvent. Complexes 2 [17] and 3 [18] were prepared with quite similar procedure as follows. To freshly prepared [Cu(CH 3 CN) 4 ]X ( X = ClO 4 - or BF 4 - ) was immediately poured a solution of L 1 or L 2 (ligand:metal = 2:1) in CH 3 CN/CH 3 OH with vigorous stirring. The resulting yellow solution was filtered and left to stand at room temperature. Orange prism (for 2 ) or block (for 3 ) crystals suitable for X-ray analyses were obtained in 55% or 70% yield by slow evaporation of the solvent. The crystal structure of complex 1 [19] is made up of two similar (only slight difference in bond distances and angles) but crystallographically independent [Cu 2 ( L 1 ) 2 (H 2 O) 6 ] 4+ cations, BF 4 \u2212 anions and solvents. In each dinuclear cationic species, as shown in Fig. 1 (a), two Cu II centers are connected by two L 1 ligands adopting the common cisoid -I configuration [12] , resulting in a discrete M 2 L 2 metallacycle which represents the smallest closed cyclic structure with a 1:1 metal-to-ligand ratio. Two similar structures self-assembled from L 1 and Cu(ClO 4 ) 2 or Cu(NO 3 ) 2 were reported recently [13] . Each Cu II center in 1 is penta-coordinated to two nitrogen donors of L 1 and two water molecules, forming the basal plane, and one water ligand from the axial position, taking a distorted square-pyramid geometry (CuN 2 O 3 ) with \u03c4 value of ca. 0.1 (0.074, 0.162, 0.143, 0.102, respectively) [20] . Within each metallacyclic motif with the approximate dimensions of 7.9 \u00d7 7.3 \u00c5 2 , the Cu\u2013Cu separation is 7.962(1) \u00c5 for Cu(1)\u2013Cu(2) and 7.970(1) \u00c5 for Cu(3)\u2013Cu(4). Analysis of the crystal packing of 1 reveals that these M 2 L 2 cationic rings are parallel-stacked along crystallographic [0 0 1] direction (see Fig. S2 ), and the anions and solvents are located up and down these macrocyclic cations. The structure of complex 2 [19] consists of a novel cage-like [Cu 2 ( L 1 ) 3 (CH 3 CN) 2 ] 2+ cation in which a water molecule is included, and two perchlorate anions. As depicted in Fig. 1 (b), two Cu I centers related by a crystallographically C 2 symmetry are linked by three L 1 ligands with the same cisoid -I conformation as that in 1 . It is interesting that the resulting trigonal prism cation hosts a water guest, which further stabilizes this framework. Each Cu I center is in a distorted tetrahedral geometry surrounded by three nitrogen donors from the distinct ligands, as well as the N-terminal of an acetonitrile solvent. The Cu\u2013N bond distances vary from 2.032(6) to 2.085(7) \u00c5, all being normal for bipyridyl\u2013Cu I complexes; the bond angles around the metal center lie in the range 102.6(3)\u2013119.3(2)\u00b0. Intramolecular Cu\u2013Cu (symmetry code: \u2212 x + 1, y , \u2212 z + 3/2) separation in 2 is 8.926(5) \u00c5, significantly longer than that in 1 . The overall dimensions of this prism could be estimated from an imaginary outer cylinder with a diameter of 10.6 \u00c5 and a height of 18.3 \u00c5. The inner cavity may be described through the Cu\u2013Cu distance and the edge length (ca. 5.9 \u00c5) of the triangle defined by the centers of three pyridyl rings. These cationic M 2 L 3 prisms are parallel-stacked along [1 0 1] direction in the unit cell and the anions exist in the voids between them (see Fig. S4 ). The ligands L 1 in both 1 and 2 exhibit similar cisoid -I conformation and cis -arrangement. Thus, from above structural descriptions, we can clearly see that the choice of metal center is critical in formation of the resultant M 2 L 2 ring or M 2 L 3 cage. Each Cu II center in 1 acts as a 2-connecting node by two node-to-node connectors ( L 1 ), and Cu I in 2 as a 3-connecting node by three similar L 1 . In order to further testify the ligand functionality in formation of the coordination frameworks, analog L 2 (with different pyridyl N orientation to L 1 ) was employed to self-assemble with Cu I (BF 4 ), giving {[Cu( L 2 ) 2 (CH 3 CN)](BF 4 ) \u00b7 (H 2 O) 1.5 } n ( 3 ). Each Cu I center in 3 [19] also takes similar tetrahedral sphere to that in 2 , coordinating with four nitrogen atoms from three L 2 and one acetonitrile. The Cu\u2013N bond distances are in the range of 2.013(4)\u20132.076(5) \u00c5, and the bond angles 101.50(17)\u2013122.90(17)\u00b0. As demonstrated in Fig. 2 , the ligands L 2 have two types of coordination modes with Cu I : bidentate bridges which extend Cu I centers to form a 1-D chain (Cu\u2013Cu distance within it being 13.490 \u00c5) and monodentate terminals which locate on one side of the chain, generating a comb-like motif. It should be noted that such a coordination framework is quite similar to the Cu I (ClO 4 ) complex 3a of L 2 [14] . Further investigation of the crystal packing of 3 shows that these 1-D cationic arrays are parallel-stacked along [1 0 0] direction, and two adjacent such stacks with anti-arrangements interlace each other (using the bidentate L 2 segments, Fig. S5 ), showing substantial face-to-face \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions (the closest approach between the oxadiazole and pyridyl rings from two neighboring L 2 is 3.5 \u00c5 with a center-to-center distance of 3.8 \u00c5) [21] . Thus, we could consider that these 1-D arrays are further extended to 2-D supramolecular motif through aromatic stacking, and monodentate side L 2 molecules lead to the formation of quadrangled channels along a -axis ( Fig. S6 ). Computation of the channel space [22] reveals a value of 320 \u00c5 3 , corresponding to 21.0% of the unit-cell volume, where the counter anions and solvent guests are accommodated. Comparing this stacking mode with that of Cu I (ClO 4 ) complex 3a of L 2 [14] , the most significant difference resides in that monodentate side L 2 ligands in 3 are arranged alternately along [0 1 0] direction, however in 3a , they are overlapped along [0 1 0] direction with significant aromatic stacking interactions, and thus obviously, leading to larger channel volumes (662 \u00c5 3 , corresponding to 37.2% of the unit-cell volume). As reported previously, apart from the pyridyl nitrogen atoms, the nitrogen donors of the central five-membered oxadiazole system can also be as potential coordination sites with metal ion, especially for Ag I . Although Cu I usually exhibits similar local coordination tendency to Ag I , however, it does not bind to N oxadiazole in all the cases. The role of anions in formation of Cu II -involving coordination supramolecular systems based on L 1 or L 2 has been studied in detail [10,13,15] by us, and in this communication, the determined factor of metal center or ligand functionality for self-assembling of discrete or infinite patterns is further presented, which may provide helpful information for constructing other metal-organic coordination frameworks with similar bent dipyridyl linkers.

A total of 42997 (for 1 ), 10910 (for 2 ) and 8596 (for 3 ) reflections were collected, of which 14279 (for 1 ), 3907 (for 2 ) and 5347 (for 3 ) are independent ( R int = 0.0656, 0.0579 and 0.0368, respectively). The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares with SHELXTL package (semi-empirical absorption corrections were applied using SADABS program). The H atoms of ligands were generated with assigned isotropic thermal parameters, and most of the solvent H were not located. In the refinement of 1 and 2 , a disorder model of the anions was applied to make their terminal atoms exhibit more suitable displacement ellipsoids.

        "abstract": "A novel box-like dinuclear AgI complex [AgL(CH3CN)]2(ClO4)2 (L being 2,3-di-2-pyridyl-5-nitroquinoxaline) has been synthesized and structurally characterized by infrared (IR), UV-Vis spectra and X-ray diffraction. The crystal structure indicates that the two intramolecular AgI centers are spanned by two ligands thus forming a unique box-like cyclic dimer. Each AgI center is four-coordinated by three nitrogen atoms of two ligands and a CH3CN nitrogen donor in distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry. The most striking feature of this complex resides in the formation of an extended supra-molecular network with unique \u03bc4-ClO4 - bridging mode through intermolecular C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O interactions. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

X-ray diffraction analysis at room temperature indicates that the complex (C40H28Cl2CuN8O16, Mr = 1011.14) crystallizes in orthorhombic system, space group P212121 with a = 13.983(1), b = 14.310(1), c = 20.890(2) \u00c5, V = 4179.7(6) \u00c53, Z = 4, Dc = 1.607 g/cm3, F(000) = 2026, \u03bc(MoK\u03b1) = 0.736 mm-1. The final R and wR factors are 0.0446 and 0.1212 respectively with 8545 independent reflections. The title complex is composed of a discrete [CuL3]2+ cation, uncoordinated ClO4 - anions, H2O and CH3CN molecules. The central Cu(II) atom is six-coordinated by six nitrogen donors of three ligands. The coordination geometry of Cu(II) could be considered as an approximately ideal octahedral configuration with little static Jahn-Teller distortion (the longest and shortest Cu - N bonds are 2.102 vs 2.139 \u00c5 with the mean length of 2.122 \u00c5), which is very rare for a six-coordinated Cu(II) complex.",

        "abstract": "Two NiII complexes of 1,5-diazacyclooctane (DACO), [Ni(DACO)2]Br2 (I) and [Ni(DACO)2]Br\u00b7ClO4 (II) have been newly synthesized and characterized. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of DACO and both NiII complexes reveals that DACO takes boat/chair conformation in the solid state and its NiII complexes. In complex I, NiII ion is at the center of symmetry, which is four-coordinated by nitrogen donors of DACO. However, in complex II, an unexpected coordination mode of [M(DACO)2]2+ (M = CuII and NiII) was found, in which two DACO ligands are related to each other by a mirror plane and the coordination sphere of NiII is a distorted planar geometry. Furthermore, complexes I and II form quite different packing patterns (macrocycle or chain) through hydrogen bonds, which may be a key role to stabilize the crystals. The results of theoretical calculation indicate that complex I has thermodynamic stability, while II has chemical stability. Therefore, both of them have the probability to be obtained from different reaction processes or conditions. \u00a9 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "A series of silver(I) coordination polymers have been synthesized by the combination of an extended 2,4\u2032-bipyridyl linker trans-1-(2-pyridyl)-2-(4- pyridyl)ethylene (bpe) and different benzenedicarboxyl tectons, including isophthalic acid (H2ip), 5-sulfoisophthalic acid (H3sip), terephthalic acid (H2tp), 2-aminoterephthalic acid (H 2ata), and 2-bromoterephthalic acid (H2bta). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction indicates that the structural patterns of these polymeric complexes diversify from two-dimensional (2-D) (3,4,5)-connected (for 2) or 63 (for 3 and 4) layers to three-dimensional (3-D) (10,3)-b (for 1) or 8-nodal self-penetrating (for 5) networks. Interestingly, the Ag I centers can show various coordination spheres such as linear, trigonal, tetrahedral, and square-pyramidal geometries. The results clearly reveal that the dicarboxyl building blocks with different dispositions of the carboxyl sites and uncoordinated substituent groups, are the crucial factors for structural assemblies of such extended frameworks. Solid-state properties for these crystalline materials have also been investigated, which display modest thermal stability and strong fluorescent emission at room temperature. \u00a9 2010 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "In the first Cu I coordination polymer containing an angular bipyridine-type ligand 2,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (bpo), {[Cu(bpo) 2 (CH 3 CN)]ClO 4 \u00b7 CH 3 CN \u00b7 (H 2 O) 1.5 } n ( 1 ), the bpo molecules exhibit different monodendate and bidendate bridging modes in binding to the Cu I center, forming a novel 1-D infinite comb-like polymeric chain with the monodendate ligands on one side. The most striking feature of this structure is the formation of a 3-D porous network with large rectangular channels through two distinct types of inter-chain \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions, which was further stabilized by weak hydrogen-bonding interactions. Keywords Crystal structure Coordination polymer Copper(I) Aromatic stacking interactions Supramolecular assembly The rapid development in crystal engineering of metal-involved supramolecular architectures assembled by means of coordination bonds, hydrogen bonds, or other weak intermolecular interactions continues to produce various structures with interesting compositions and topologies, along with potential applications as a new class of functional solid materials with zeolite-like molecular-sized channels, cavities and pores [1\u20135] . By the careful selection and design of organic ligands (building blocks), a wide variety of solid coordination polymers or supermolecules have been constructed [6\u20139] and it is known that, the assembly processes are affected by many factors including metal ions, the nature of ligands, metal/ligand ratio, counter-ions, solvents and even pH value [10] . Aromatic-aromatic or \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interaction is one of the important types of non-covalent intermolecular forces similar to hydrogen bonding and has been recognized to play a key role in the stabilization and regulatory functions of both biological systems and supramolecular construction, where it contributes significantly to self-assembly and molecular recognition processes [11\u201313] . However, in contrast to the well-understood hydrogen bonding interaction, the nature and utilization of \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction, mainly for further development of supramolecular chemistry and prediction of crystal structures, is still not well documented [14] . Recently, we have initiated a research program for the construction of various supramolecular architectures with interesting extended frameworks based on a designed angular dipyridyl ligand, 2,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (bpo) and its 3-pyridyl isomer [15\u201318] . The role of subtle controlling factors, especially the use of counter anions, of the self-assembly processes in the formation of these novel coordination polymers or supermolecules was investigated in detail. Herein, we report the first 3-D framework constructed form Cu I and bpo through significant \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions as well as the presence of other weak intermolecular forces. Bpo and [Cu(CH 3 CN) 4 ]ClO 4 were synthesized according to the literature method [15,19] . To freshly prepared [Cu(CH 3 CN) 4 ]ClO 4 (48 mg, 0.15 mmol) was immediately added a solution of bpo (82 mg, 0.37 mmol) in CH 3 CN/CH 3 OH with vigorous stirring for ca. 10 min. The resulting yellow solution was filtered and left to stand at room temperature. Orange well-shaped block-like crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained in 75% yield within two-weeks by slow evaporation of the solvent [20] . The ligand bpo is very soluble in common polar organic solvents (such as CH 2 Cl 2 , CHCl 3 , CH 3 OH, CH 3 CN and C 2 H 5 OH), so that crystallization of its complexes with inorganic metal salts occurs readily. Complex 1 was directly obtained by reacting Cu I with excess ligand bpo to avoid oxidation to the Cu II state. 1 is air stable and insoluble in common organic solvents and water, being consistent with its polymeric nature. In its IR spectrum, the broad band centered at ca. 3400 cm \u22121 accounts for O\u2013H stretching of the water molecules and the characteristic absorption band with medium intensity of CH 3 CN ( \u03bd CN ) appears at 2247 cm \u22121 . The skeletal vibrations of the aromatic rings occur in the 1400\u20131600 cm \u22121 region. In addition, the occurrence of split \u03bd Cl-O stretches of the perchlorate ions at \u223c1100 cm \u22121 (another characteristic band is at 627 cm \u22121 ) provides good evidence of their involvement in the formation of hydrogen bonding interactions. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of a polycrystalline sample of 1 showed the first weight loss from 60 to 160 \u00b0C, corresponding to the removal of H 2 O and CH 3 CN solvate molecules. The framework remained stable up to 200 \u00b0C and finally collapsed beyond that temperature. Single-crystal X-ray analysis [21] showed that 1 is made up of a 3-D [Cu(bpo) 2 (CH 3 CN)] + supramolecular framework containing rectangular channels that accommodate the ClO 4 \u2212 counter anions and solvate guest molecules. Each Cu I center is in a distorted tetrahedral geometry surrounded by three nitrogen donors from adjacent bpo ligands, as well as the N -terminal of an acetonitrile ligand. The Cu\u2013N bond distances vary from 2.006(4) to 2.078(4) \u00c5, all being normal for bipyridyl Cu I complexes; the bond angles around the metal center lie in the range 99.0(2)\u2013123.0(2)\u00b0. The Cu center, in view of its distorted tetrahedral geometry and the orange color of the crystals, is obviously in the +1 oxidation state. The ESR signal (measured at both room temperature and 77 K on a single-crystal sample) of 1 is silent, further confirming that the status of the copper center in 1 is Cu I . It is notable that the two independent bpo ligands exhibit different bidendate bridging and terminal monodendate coordination modes. The former type of bpo spacers link the Cu I centers to generate a 1-D coordination chain in which the neighboring Cu\u22efCu separation is 13.476(7) \u00c5, whereas the latter type of bpo molecules are aligned on only one side of this chain to form the comb-like architecture as depicted in Fig. 1 . Both types of bpo adopt the planar conformation: in the bidendate bridging case, the two 4-pyridyl rings make dihedral angles of 175.7\u00b0 and 172.7\u00b0 with the central oxadiazole ring, and a dihedral angle of 7.3\u00b0 with each other. The corresponding data for the monodendate bpo molecule are 3.1\u00b0, 7.0\u00b0 and 9.2\u00b0. Apart from the pyridyl nitrogen atoms, it has been demonstrated that the nitrogen atoms of the central five-membered oxadiazole system can also function as potential donors under approximate conditions [22,23] , although this is not observed in the present study. Comparing 1 with the corresponding Ag I and Cu II perchlorate complexes with bpo, we may conclude that the nature of the metal ion plays a dominant role in the formation of different supramolecular patterns: in {[Ag(bpo)](ClO 4 )(CH 3 OH) 0.5 (H 2 O) 0.5 } n , the bpo molecules connect linear Ag I centers with its terminal pyridyl nitrogen atoms to form a 1-D chain motif [22] , whereas in the 3-D coordination polymer {[Cu(bpo) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ](ClO 4 )(OH)(H 2 O) 2.5 } n , the bpo spacers bridge the Cu II ion as 4-connected nodes to form a unique 2-fold interpenetrating diamondoid network [15] . Analysis of the crystal packing of 1 showed that the 1-D cationic coordination polymeric chains are further \u201cconnected\u201d by \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions to form a 3-D supramolecular network. As shown in Fig. 2 , two adjacent comb-like motifs interlace each other to form a one-dimensional molecular zipper architecture through weak aromatic stacking interactions (type A). The distance of two parallel oxadiazole rings from two adjacent monodendate bpo molecules is only 3.47 \u00c5 with a center-to-center separation of 3.77 \u00c5, indicating significant face-to-face \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions [24] . A series of similar double-stranded helices or molecular zippers assembled from single coordination chains through aromatic stacking interactions have been reported recently [25] ; in these interesting structures, the flexible or V-shaped dicarboxylates bridge the Cu II centers to form one-dimensional coordination chains, which are further extended by aromatic stacks between the terminal chelated ligands (2,-2 \u2032 bipyridine or 1,10-phenanthroline). In the case of 1, neighboring bpo molecules belonging to two supramolecular zippers also show substantial face-to-face \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions (type B): the closest approach between the oxadiazole and pyridine rings ( Fig. 2 ) from two distinct bpo is 3.45 \u00c5 with a center-to-center distance of 3.79 \u00c5. Thus both types of aromatic \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions extend the 1-D polymeric chains into a 3-D supramolecular network. When viewed along the crystallographic [1 0 0] direction, large rectangular channels are observed as shown in Fig. 3 . Computation of the channel space [26] gave a value of 662 \u00c5 3 , corresponding to 37.2% of the unit-cell volume. Allowing for the volume of the included anions and solvate molecules, there still remains 25.4 \u00c5 3 of void space. In addition, the 3-D architecture is further stabilized by weak C\u2013H\u22efO hydrogen bonding interactions (C\u22efO separations 3.289\u20133.510 \u00c5, bond angles 150.7\u2013177.7\u00b0) between the host framework and the perchlorate anions in the channels. In conclusion, the stable Cu I supramolecular compound 1 has been prepared by means of direct self-assembly between Cu I and the bpo building block, and it exhibits a 3-D open host framework with large rectangular channels. The results reported here clearly indicate that the aromatic rings of bpo are potential interaction sites for intermolecular \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking, which can be utilized to advantage in supramolecular assembly and crystal engineering.

All these compounds were structurally determined by X-ray single-crystal diffraction, and the bulk new materials were further identified by X-ray powder diffraction. Complexes 1 and 6 show 1-D zigzag or linear Htma-bridged polymeric chains, with the terminal bpt ligands as pendants, which are extended to 2-D hydrogen-bonded arrays with 4.8(2) or (6,3) network topology. Coordination polymers 2 and 3, in which the 2-D corrugated metal-organic frameworks make the interdigitated 3-D packing, are isostructural. Complex 4 has a mononuclear structure, and its subunits are hydrogen-bonded to each other to give a 2-D grid-like net. For complex 5, the Cd(II) centers are linked by bpt/Htma ligands to form a 2-D (4,4) coordination layer, and these layers are interdigitated in pairs. Notably, secondary noncovalent forces, such as hydrogen bonds, play an important role in extending and stabilizing these structural topologies. Interestingly, distinct products are obtained for Co(II) (1 and 2) and Cd(II) (5 and 6) under ambient or hydrothermal conditions; however, for Ni(II) and Zn(II), single products, 3 and 4, are generated. The thermal stabilities of 1-6 were studied by thermogravimetric analysis of mass loss. The desorption/adsorption properties of the porous material 5 are also discussed. Solid-state luminescent spectra of the Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes, 4-6, indicate intense fluorescent emissions at ca. 380 nm.",

        "title": "Conformational isomerism of a flexible fluorinated bis-pyridinecarboxamide ligand in the structural direction of two distinct layered CuII coordination polymers",
        "abstract": "Reaction of a flexible pyridinecarboxamide ligand N , N \u2032-[(2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-1,4-phenylene) bis(methylene)]bis(pyridine-4-carboxamide) (H 2 tfpbbp) with Cu II chloride or perchlorate affords two coordination polymers {[Cu(H 2 tfpbbp)(tfpbbp)(H 2 O)] \u00b7 2DMF \u00b7 4H 2 O} n ( 1 ) and {[Cu(H 2 tfpbbp) 2 (ClO 4 ) 2 ] \u00b7 3H 2 O} n ( 2 ). Both complexes have 2-D (4,4) layered networks extended by the exo-bidentate bridging ligands, which however consist of distinct [Cu\u2013ligand] 4 meshes owing to the conformational difference of ligands. Their spectroscopic, thermal, and fluorescence properties have also been investigated. Keywords Flexible tecton Ligand conformation Coordination polymer Crystal structure Photoluminescence Various intriguing architectures and potential properties as functional solid materials are two primary interests in the research of coordination polymers [1,2] . Many cases are now known for such crystalline solids that possess the identical metal-ligand compositions and, however, exhibit different structures, which suggest the possibility to apply the well-established concept of molecular isomerism to design the extended networks. Zaworotko et al. have described a case of supramolecular isomerism caused by the variable ligand conformation of 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane, which can adopt gauche (angular) or anti (linear) conformations to result in three Co II complexes with entirely different polymeric structures [3] . Recently, coordination polymers with flexible bis-pyridine-based carboxamide ligands as the bridging spacers have been widely explored. For instance, Biradha [4a] and Liu [4b] have reported the construction of 1-D chains and 2-D (4,4) networks from 1,2-bis(4-pyridinecarboxamido)ethane (bpe) and Cu II salts, in which the ligand bpe may possess either anti or gauche conformation via the free rotation of methylene. Clearly, the conformation diversity aroused by the flexible alkyl chain can dramatically affect the resultant extended structures. As a consequence, structural control of coordination polymers with such flexible ligands is still a tremendous challenge, which may be easily influenced by several subtle factors in the synthetic route such as counterions [5] , metal-to-ligand ratio [6] , and solvents [7] . The enclathration ability of coordination networks with electron-rich aromatic ligands may be improved by introducing the electron-deficient substituents into the ligand backbones, which are usually involved in efficient intermolecular interactions with the guest molecules [8] . It has been found that the host-guest C\u2013H\u22efF and N\u2013H\u22efF contacts can be as important as C\u2013H\u22efO and C\u2013H\u22efN interactions in stabilizing the specific lattice structures [9] , and as such, be applied in crystal design. Recently, we have developed an interesting building block, N , N \u2032-[(2,3,5,6-tetra-fluoro-1,4-phenylene)bis(methylene)]bis(pyridine-4-carboxamide) (H 2 tfpbbp), which has a flexible disposition of the pyridyl, carboxamide, and methylene groups around a tetrafluorinated benzene skeleton that will promote the formation of secondary interactions. As far as we know, with the exception of a microporous Zn II complex of H 2 tfpbbp [10] , coordination polymer with such flexible bis-pyridyl carboxamide ligands based on a fluorinated backbone has not been reported so far. As one of our systematic works, we present herein two novel Cu II coordination polymers {[Cu(H 2 tfpbbp)(tfpbbp)(H 2 O)] \u00b7 2DMF\u00b74H 2 O} n ( 1 ) and {[Cu(H 2 tfpbbp) 2 (ClO 4 ) 2 ] \u00b7 3H 2 O} n ( 2 ) that display an extended distinctness of 2-D (4,4) networks derived from the conformational discrepancy of the ligands ( anti in 1 and gauche in 2 , see Scheme 1 ). In addition, the spectroscopic, thermal, and fluorescence properties of 1 and 2 will also be described. Complex 1 was prepared under general conditions by the reaction of equimolar CuCl 2 \u00b7 2H 2 O and H 2 tfpbbp in CH 3 OH/DMF media, giving large blue block crystals through slow evaporation of the solvents [11] , whereas large dark-blue block crystals of 2 were similarly obtained by using Cu(ClO 4 ) 2 \u00b7 6H 2 O and H 2 tfpbbp in CH 3 OH [12] . The infrared spectra of 1 and 2 were soundly consistent with their composing. Features corresponding to pyridyl ring were observed in the region of 600\u2013860 cm \u22121 . Sharp bands with medium intensity are found in the range of \u223c1600 to \u223c1200 cm \u22121 , arising from the stretching modes of the aromatic rings of the ligand. Strong intensity bands in the range of 1650\u20131665 cm \u22121 are assigned to the C O stretching mode. Bands between 3050 and 3150 cm \u22121 represent the aromatic C\u2013H stretching modes. A broad band in the range of \u223c3400 to \u223c3200 cm \u22121 represents the N\u2013H subunit within the H 2 tfpbbp ligands, overlapping with O\u2013H stretching modes for water molecules. For 2 , the occurrence of split Cl\u2013O stretches of the ClO 4 - ions at \u223c1100 cm \u22121 provides good evidence of their involvement in the formation of hydrogen bonds. X-ray diffraction study [13] demonstrates that 1 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P 1 \u00af . The asymmetric unit is provided by a Cu II ion located at an inversion center, two ligand molecules (H 2 tfpbbp and tfpbbp) with centrosymmetry, one lattice DMF, and disordered water moieties (see Fig. S1 ). Each Cu II ion is embraced by four nitrogen donors from two H 2 tfpbbp and two tfpbbp ligands in the equatorial plane (Cu1\u2013N1 = 2.039(2) and Cu1\u2013N3 = 2.064(2) \u00c5) as well as two axial water molecules, displaying significant Jahn\u2013Teller distortion with the Cu\u2013O length of 2.965(8) \u00c5 (see Table S1 for details). It is interesting that the chloride anions are not involved in the final crystalline product, and one ligand component is bis-deprotonated to provide additional negative charges for necessary charge balance. For the tfpbbp ligand, the C16\u2013N4 bond distance (1.391(4) \u00c5) is significantly longer than that of C6\u2013N2 (1.343(6) \u00c5) for H 2 tfpbbp in the same structure and the C\u2013N length (1.337(3) \u00c5) for H 2 tfpbbp in its Zn II complex [10] . It is also observed that the N\u2013H group of the neutral H 2 tfpbbp ligand is engaged in N2\u2013H2A\u22efO3 i hydrogen bonding (H\u22efO/N\u22efO distance: 2.37/3.219(5) \u00c5, angles: 167\u00b0; i = x \u2212 1, y , z ) with the included DMF molecule (see Table S2 for details of H-bonding). Both H 2 tfpbbp and the deprotonated tfpbbp ligands adopt the trans -conformation to avoid the steric hindrance and connect the adjacent Cu II ions to form a two-dimensional (2-D) coordination network. The open grid-like (4,4) coordination layer is extended along the ac plane with approximately dimensions of 20.0 \u00d7 20.1 \u00c5 2 for the square unit, in which the diagonal Cu\u22efCu distances are 26.5 \u00d7 30.1 \u00c5 and the Cu\u22efCu\u22efCu angles are 82.66\u00b0 and 97.34\u00b0, respectively (see Fig. 1 a). The adjacent 2-D layers are parallel and stack in a stagger fashion along [0 1 0], which are further interconnected via interlayer O6\u2013H6B\u22efN4 interactions (see Fig. 1 b). This 3-D architecture has the void space of 578.7 \u00c5 3 , corresponding to 39.3% of the unit cell volume (1473.1 \u00c5 3 ) as evaluated by PLATON [14] , which is occupied by the DMF and H 2 O molecules. Additionally, an O5\u2013H5B\u22efF2 bond between the lattice water and coordination array as well as multiple weak C\u2013H\u22efO and C\u2013H\u22efF interactions (see Table S2 ) are found to stabilize this 3-D framework. X-ray crystallographic analysis [13] reveals that 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P 2 1 / n and shows a 2-D corrugated layer structure in which only gauche H 2 tfpbbp is observed. Each Cu II ion is also in an elongated octahedral geometry, coordinating to four H 2 tfpbbp ligands via the pyridyl groups in the equatorial plane and two axial perchlorate anions (see Fig. S2 ). The Cu\u2013O bond lengths are differentiated by 0.238 \u00c5 (Cu1\u2013O5 = 2.463(2) \u00c5; Cu1\u2013O11 = 2.701(3) \u00c5) and considerably longer than those of the Cu\u2013N bonds (see Table S1 ), indicating a Jahn\u2013Teller distortion. In this structure, the H 2 tfpbbp ligands also serve as 2-connecting spacers to link the adjacent Cu II ions, leading to the formation of a 2-D infinite (4,4) layer along the ab plane on the basis of [Cu 4 (H 2 tfpbbp) 4 ] units (see Fig. 2 ). However, in contrast to that of 1 , all H 2 tfpbbp ligands adopt the gauche conformation in this case and each topological (4,4) grid has the dimensions of 12.6 \u00d7 13.2 \u00c5 2 , which are significantly reduced than those in 1 and should be assigned to the conformational discrepancy of the flexible ligand. The diagonal Cu\u22efCu distances for each unit are 17.2 and 19.2 \u00c5, respectively. Intralayer N5\u2013H5B\u22efF6 and N6\u2013H6A\u22efF2 interactions (see Table S2 ) are found to consolidate this corrugated 2-D pattern. In addition, the amide and fluoride groups from the adjacent parallel 2-D motifs are engaged in multiple N\u2013H\u22efF and N\u2013H\u22efO interactions to realize a 3-D supramolecular network. The effective void is suggested to 1927.6 \u00c5 3 (33.2% per unit cell volume as calculated by PLATON [14] ), which is filled by the guest water molecules. Moreover, small interspaces (447.7 \u00c5 3 , 7.7% per unit cell volume) are also found for the entire 3-D crystalline lattice. Complexes 1 and 2 are air-stable and insoluble in water or most organic solvents, being consistent with their polymeric and neutral nature. The phase purities of the bulk samples were identified by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD, see Fig. S3 ). The thermal behaviors of 1 and 2 were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen atmosphere with the heating rate of 15 \u00b0C/min (see Fig. S4 ). The TGA curve of 1 shows a weight loss of 21.69% from 75 \u00b0C to 155 \u00b0C, corresponding to the removal of all water molecules (including the aqua ligand) and the DMF solvents (calculated: 20.81%). Then, a sharp weight loss occurs with an onset temperature of ca. 260 \u00b0C for degradation of the residual coordination framework, followed by continual slow weight loss until 800 \u00b0C. In the case of 2 , the TGA trace reveals that the first weight loss of 5.31% occurs in the temperature range of 45\u2013130 \u00b0C, which can be attributed to the removal of all guest water molecules (4.68% calculated). The remaining framework is decomposed through two consecutive weight losses from 255 \u00b0C to 800 \u00b0C. Photoluminescent properties of both complexes were investigated in the solid-state at room temperature. Complexes 1 and 2 show strong fluorescent emissions with a maximum at 421 and 425 nm (see Fig. 3 ), respectively, upon the irradiation of ultraviolet light (370 nm). In light of the close emission energy, the emission of both complexes is tentatively attributed to the intraligand transition of H 2 tfpbbp that are slightly modified by metal coordination. The emission in the blue region suggests that both complexes may be potential blue-light-emitting materials. In summary, for utilization of a fluorinated bis-pyridinecarboxamide derivative ligand and different metal salts, we have synthesized two new layered Cu II coordination polymers with distinct open and close 2-D lattice networks. Conformational isomerism of the flexible ligand is responsible for their significant structural discrepancy. Both complexes exhibit strong blue luminescence. This work may provide a helpful strategy for the construction of other new materials with fancy network structures and amusing properties, which is undergoing in our lab.

        "abstract": "To systematically explore the higher-dimensional network structures with mixed connectivity, a series of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with unusual (3,6)-connected net topologies are presented. These crystalline materials include [{[Mn(btza)2(H2O)2].2 H2O}n] (1), [{[Zn(btza)2(H2O)2].2 H2O}n] (2), [{[Cu(btza)2].H2O}n] (3), and [{[Cd(btza)2].3 H2O}n] (4), which have been successfully assembled through a predesigned three-connected organic component bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)acetate (btza) with a variety of octahedral metal cores based on the modular synthetic methodology. The topological paradigms shown in this work cover the 2D CdCl2, 3D (4(2).6)2(4(4).6(2).8(7).10(2)), and pyrite (pyr) types. That is, when properly treated with the familiar first-row divalent metal ions, btza may perfectly furnish the coordination spheres for effective connectivity to result in diverse (3,6)-connected nets. Beyond this, a detailed analysis of network topology for all known 3D (3,6)-connected frameworks in both inorganic and inorganic-organic hybrid materials is described. Specific network connectivity of these MOFs indicates that the metal centers represent the most significant and alterable factor in structural assembly, although they show reliable and similar geometries. In this context, the combination of the distinct d10 AgI ion with btza in different solvents affords two isomorphous MOFs [{[Ag(btza)].glycol}n] (5) and [{[Ag(btza)]CH3OH}n] (6) with a binodal 4-connected 3D SrAl2 (sra) topology. The network structures of MOFs 1-3 and 5 turn out to be more complicated and interesting if one considers the hydrogen bonding between the host coordination frameworks and the intercalated solvent molecules. Furthermore, the role of the included solvents in the generation and stabilization of MOFs 1-6 is also investigated.",

        "abstract": "Six novel inorganic-organic coordination supramolecular networks based on a versatile linking unit 4-pyridylthioacetate (pyta) and inorganic Co(II), Cu(II), Ag(I), Zn(II), Mn(II) and Pb(II) salts have been prepared in water medium and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Reaction of CoCl(2).6H(2)O with Hpyta afforded a neutral mononuclear complex [Co(pyta)(2)(H(2)O)(4)](1), which exhibits a two-dimensional (2-D) layered architecture through intermolecular O-HO interactions. Reaction of CuCl(2.2H(2)O with Hpyta yielded a neutral one-dimensional (1-D) coordination polymer [[Cu(pyta)(2)(H(2)O].0.5H(2)O](n)(2) consisting of rectangle molecular square units, which show a three-dimensional (3-D) supramolecular network through S...S and O-H...O weak interactions. However, when AgNO(3), Zn(OAc)(2).2H(2)O or MnCl(2).4H(2)O salts were used in the above self-assembled processes, the neutral 2-D coordination polymers [Ag(pyta)](n)(3), [[Zn(pyta)(2)].4H(2)O](n)(4) or [[Mn(pyta)(2)(H(2)O)]](n)(5) with different topologies were obtained, respectively. While substituting the transition metal ions used in 1-5 with Pb(OAc)(2).3H(2)O, a one-dimensional coordination polymer [Pb(pyta)(2)](n)(6), which shows a novel 2-fold interpenetrating 2-D supramolecular architecture through weak SS interactions, was isolated. It is interesting to note that the building block pyta anion exhibits different configurations and coordination modes in the solid structures of complexes 1-6. These results indicate that the versatile nature of this flexible ligand, together with the coordination preferences of the metal centers, play a critical role in construction of these novel coordination polymers or supramolecules. The spectral and thermal properties of these new materials have also been investigated.",

They are isomorphous and crystallize in a tetragonal system with space group P 42(1)c. The structure can be considered to be built up by cubanelike [Ln(4)(OH)(4)](8+) secondary building units, which are further connected by 3-SBA to form a 3D coordination framework with 1D pores along the c direction for accommodation of novel T8(3) water tapes or zigzag water chains. Furthermore, in these compounds, the [Ln(4)(OH)(4)](8+) units and 3-SBA ligands serve as 12-connected and 3-connected nodes, respectively, resulting in a unique (3,12)-connected framework with the Schlafli symbol of (4(3))(4)(4(20).6(28).8(18)). The luminescent properties of the Eu(III) (1) and Tb(III) (3) complexes have been studied, showing characteristic emissions at room temperature.

In the structure of the Co II complex 1 , the polycatenation of inclined 2-D (4,4) coordination layers leads to the formation of a 3-D supramolecular framework, whereas two types of 1-D polymeric chains are observed in another Co II coordination species 2 , which are interconnected via H-bonding to result in an unusual 3-D host\u2013guest lattice. Notably, complexes 1 and 2 have been prepared under similar hydrothermal conditions and their structural discrepancy can only be ascribed to a subtle change of basicity for the reaction solution. The Zn II complex 3 is isostructural to 2 , and the Cd II complex 4 displays a 2-fold parallel interpenetrating array of undulating (4,4) coordination layers. By using the conventional solvent evaporation method, two Pb II naphthalenedicarboxylates [Pb(1,4-nda)(DMF)] n ( 5 ) and {[Pb 2 (2,6-nda) 2 (DMF) 2 ](DMF)} n ( 6 ) have also been prepared (2,6-nda = 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate). Complex 5 has a unique 5-connected 3-D coordination architecture, whereas 6 represents a 3-fold interpenetrating framework of 4-connected diamond topology. Their structural difference suggests the significant isomeric effect of the naphthalenedicarboxylate tectons on structural assemblies. Thermal stability of these crystalline materials has been investigated by thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG\u2013DTA) technique and solid-state luminescent properties of the Zn II , Cd II , and Pb II complexes have also been explored.

        "abstract": "The reaction of 2,5-bis(2-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole ( L 1 ) with Cu(OAc) 2 \u00b7H 2 O salt in a CH 3 OH/CH 3 CN medium produces a new monometallic copper(II) complex 1 [Cu( L 4 )(OAc)(H 2 O)](H 2 O) 2 (CH 3 CN), where H L 4 = N -(\u03b1-hydroxyl-2-pyridyl)- N \u2032-(\u03b1-methoxy-2-pyridyl)ketazine (C 13 H 12 N 4 O 2 ), which was characterized by IR, UV\u2013vis and elemental analysis, and established by X-ray diffraction technique. The results reveal that metal-assisted alcoholysis of L 1 leads to the open of the central oxadiazole ring to give a new ligand H L 4 during this course. In the crystal structure of complex 1 , L 4 acts as a tridentate chelating anionic ligand to coordinate to the Cu II center, which lies in a square-pyramid coordination environment. Additionally, hydrogen-bonding interactions also play an important role in the self-assembly process. The mechanism of the metal-assisted alcoholysis of L 1 in formation of complex 1 was discussed in detail and the spectral properties of 1 were also investigated.",

Complex 1 crystallizes in orthorhombic crystal system, Pbcn space group with a = 1.6075(4), b = 1.0539(3), c = 0.9195(3) nm, V = 1.5578(7) nm3, Mr = 352.79, Z = 4, Dc = 1.487 g/cm3, final R = 0.0451 and wR = 0.1294. The structure of 1 indicates that the central Cu(II) atom is penta-coordinated by four nitrogen atoms of two DACH moieties at the equatorial positions and a water molecule at the axis position. The coordination geometry of Cu(II) could be considered as an approximately ideal square-pyramidal environment. Both DACH rings arrange in cis-form and are predominantly in the boat-boat conformation (80%) with some disorder to the chair-chair conformation (20%). The Cl - anions are hydrogen bonded with the nitrogen donors of the DACH rings and the oxygen donor of the coordinated H2O molecule to form a one-dimensional zigzag linear structure.

The crystal structures of both complexes have been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. In the mononuclear complex 1, the CuII center is coordinated to four N atoms of dpa and two N donors of azide (CuN6), taking an elongated octahedral geometry. The solvent water molecules interlink the neutral [Cu(dpa)2(N3)2] units through hydrogen bonds to form a two-dimensional (2D) layered structure with strong \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions between the adjacent pyridine rings.

The magnetic properties of 2 have been investigated by variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility and magnetization measurements, indicating a very strong anti-ferromagnetic coupling between the intra-molecular CuII centers (having the perfect square-pyramidal geometry) with J=-382 cm-1.

        "abstract": "A series of nine mixed-ligand metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been prepared by the combination of a bent dipyridyl linker 4-amino-3,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole (bpt) and three benzenedicarboxylate isomers (pa = phthalate, ip = isophthalate, and tp = terephthalate), respectively, with different metal ions such as CoII, NiII, CuII, ZnII, and CdII. The framework structures of these neutral polymeric complexes have been determined by the X-ray single-crystal diffraction technique. Structural analysis reveals that the benzenedicarboxylate isomers display versatile coordination modes to manage the metal ions to form 1-D chain or ribbon arrays, which are further extended via the exo-bidentate bpt connectors to give rise to a variety of coordination networks, such as a simple (4,4) layer, 2-D double layer with decorated (4,4) topology, 2-D layer with decorated (3,6) topology, 2-D bilayer with 82.10 topology (2-fold interpenetration), 3-D polythreaded architecture (1-D + 2-D), and 2-fold interpenetrating porous lattice of (4,4) layers. The accessorial secondary interactions such as hydrogen bonding and/or aromatic stacking are also helpful for the extension and stabilization of the final supramolecular aggregates. This work evidently indicates that the isomeric effect of the anionic benzenedicarboxylate is significant in the construction of these network structures, which are also well regulated by the metal centers. The ZnII and CdII MOFs exhibit strong solid-state luminescence emissions at room temperature, which originate differently from intraligand transition or ligand-to-metal charge transfer. Thermal stability of these crystalline materials has been explored by thermogravimetric analysis of mass loss. The 3-D host frameworks of MOFs 8 and 9 show similar porous cavities, and their desorption/adsorption behaviors of guest solvents have also been investigated.",

        "abstract": "A series of novel metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been assembled from PbII and 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H 2BDC-Cl4) by simply adding different alkali metal ions as templates. When only lead nitrate is used, a robust 3D open framework [Pb(BDC-Cl4)(MeOH)2]n (1) with pts topology can be obtained. Incorporating the lighter LiI or NaI ions into the above PbII/BDC-Cl4 system results in two unique isostructural 3D PbII-LiI and PbII-Na I heterometallic frameworks, {[PbLi2(BDC-Cl 4)(\u03bc2-OH)2](H2O)}n (2) and [PbNa2(BDC-Cl4)(\u03bc2-OH) 2]n (3), which are built from the combination of a 3D rod-packing PbII-carboxylate framework and a 3D Na I-BDC-Cl4 (or LiI-BDC-Cl4) network. When the heavier KI ion is applied, the similar reaction affords a 3D MOF [Pb2(BDC-Cl4)2(DMF)3] n (4), which represents the first pillar-layered PbII coordination network with a (3,5)-connected gra topology. The results illustrate the powerful effect of the alkali-metal templates in MOFs assemblies. The solid-state properties such as thermal stability and luminescence of 1-4 have also been studied. \u00a9 2011 American Chemical Society.",

To the best of our knowledge, among the few documented triazole-cadmium coordination polymers, this complex presents a novel configuration. The deprotonated 1,2,4-triazole is in tridentate and succinate in bis-chelate modes to link the Cd(\u2161) centers, generating a 2-D grid-like network topology. Ther-mogravimetric analysis results show that the framework architecture is a stable porous material. The fluorescent emission has also been discussed.",

        "abstract": "This work reports a series of Zn II , Cd II , Co II , and Pb II complexes with Br n -terephthalic acid ( n = 1 or 4) and a versatile bent dipyridyl tecton, which display diversiform coordination motifs and metallosupramolecular architectures that are regulated by substituent effect of the ligands as well as metal ions. Abstract This work presents a series of Zn II , Cd II , Co II , and Pb II supramolecular complexes assembled from a bent dipyridyl derivative 2,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (3-bpo) and different dicarboxyl co-ligands 2-bromoterephthalic acid (H 2 BTA) and tetrabromoterephthalic acid (H 2 TBTA). All products have been prepared under similar conditions and characterized by IR, microanalysis, and TG\u2013DTA techniques. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction indicates that these complexes display mononuclear, 1-D, and 2-D coordination motifs, and diverse higher-dimensional extended networks are further constructed via additional secondary interactions such as H-bonding and aromatic stacking. Notably, in situ hydrolysis reaction of 3-bpo is observed in the Pb II complex with H 2 TBTA, affording another dipyridyl-type ligand N , N \u2032-bis(3-picolinoyl)hydrazine (3-bph). These results evidently reveal the significant substituent effect of terephthalic acid in structural direction of these metallosupramolecular systems that are also regulated by the selection of metal ions. Keywords Metallosupramolecular complex Crystal structure Substituent effect Secondary interaction In situ ligand reaction 1 Introduction The flourishing realm of crystal engineering, which focuses on the successful achievement of desired crystalline solids from pre-designed bridging ligands and metal ions, has provided a useful and effective synthetic strategy for the construction of functional materials with established and potential applications [1\u20139] . At present, it has been extensively realized that the deliberate selection and utilization of organic tectons plays a profound role in such metallosupramolecular assemblies [10\u201315] . In this regard, building components involving pyridyl and/or carboxylate functional groups (for example, 4,4\u2032-bipyridyl and terephthalic acid) have been confirmed to be the most reliable candidates for structural assembly of new coordination solids with interesting network architectures and physicochemical properties [16\u201330] . In this context, our previous studies on a modified dipyridyl ligand with the oxadiazole spacer, namely 2,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (3-bpo), have revealed that such a building block may show three typical conformations (see Chart 1 ), various coordination modes, and potential capability for participating in secondary interactions, which thus result in multifarious metallosupramolecular systems via coordinative and other noncovalent contacts [31] . As for the Br-substituted terephthalic acid, 2-bromoterephthalic acid (H 2 BTA) has been utilized to synthesize reticular porous metal\u2013organic frameworks with good capacity for gas adsorption [32\u201334] . And very recently, another related analogous compound, tetrabromoterephthalic acid (H 2 TBTA), has also been employed to construct novel coordination networks [35,36] , in which the Br-substituents impose a significant steric effect on the formation of such supramolecular architectures. In this contribution, we will present a series of Zn II , Cd II , Co II , and Pb II mixed-ligand complexes based on H 2 BTA or H 2 TBTA (see Chart 1 ) incorporated with 3-bpo as the building blocks, aiming to explore the intrinsic steric and electronic effect of the Br-substituent of terephthalic acid on the structural direction of these coordination solids. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and general methods All reagents and solvents were commercially available and used as received. Fourier transform (FT) IR spectra (KBr pellets) were recorded on an AVATAR-370 (Nicolet) spectrometer. Elemental analyses were carried out on a CE-440 (Leemanlabs) analyzer. Thermogravimetric (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) experiments were performed in the temperature range of 25\u2013700 \u00b0C on a Rigaku standard TG-DTA analyzer under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min with an empty Al 2 O 3 crucible as the reference. 2.2 Synthesis of complexes 1 \u2013 6 2.2.1 [Zn(HBTA) 2 (3-bpo) 2 ](H 2 O) ( 1 ) A mixture of H 2 BTA (24.5 mg, 0.1 mmol) and 3-bpo (22.4 mg, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in DMF/H 2 O (10 mL, v / v = 1/1) under stirring, which was placed at the bottom of a straight glass tube. Then, a CH 3 OH solution (10 mL) of Zn(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O (29.7 mg, 0.1 mmol) was carefully layered onto it.

There was no evidence of crystal decay during data collection. Semi-empirical absorption corrections were applied using sadabs and the program saint was used for integration of the diffraction profiles [37] . The structures were solved by direct methods using the shelxs program of the shelxtl package and refined with shelxl [38] . The final refinement was performed by full-matrix least-squares methods on F 2 with anisotropic thermal parameters for all non-H atoms. In general, hydrogen atoms attached to carbon were generated geometrically and those of oxygen (carboxyl or water) were first located in difference Fourier syntheses and then treated as riding. Isotropic displacement parameters of hydrogen were derived from their parent atoms. Notably, hydrogen atoms of the lattice water molecules of O6 (for 1 ) and O8 (for 2 ) were not located. In the structure of 4 , the lattice water is disordered over two positions (O5 and O5\u2019) with the partial site-occupancies of 0.73 and 0.27, respectively, and the affiliated hydrogen atoms were also not determined. A summary of the crystallographic details of 1 \u2013 6 are shown in Table 1 . Selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table S1 and the hydrogen-bonding geometries are given in Table S2 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and general characterization All complexes were synthesised by layer-separation diffusion of the DMF/H 2 O solution of mixed ligands and the corresponding CH 3 OH solution of metal salt at ambient condition, which will facilitate the slow crystallization of X-ray quality single crystals. In each synthetic case, the equivalent metal/dicarboxyl/dipyridyl ratio was utilized for the starting materials. However, the products were found to have the stoichiometric ratios of 1:2:2 for 1 and 2 , 1:1:2 for 3 \u2013 5 , and 1:1:1 for 6 . Notably, the dicarboxyl ligand H 2 BTA takes the mono-deprotonated form (HBTA) in the resulting complexes 1 and 2 , whereas H 2 TBTA is completely deprotonated in 3 \u2013 6 . Interestingly, in situ hydrolysis reaction of 3-bpo occurs during preparation of the Pb II complex 6 , which also represents the first coordination species involving the 3-bph ligand. A related example has been observed in the hydrothermal cocrystallization of 2,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (4-bpo) with suberic acid [39] , which leads to the formation of a binary cocrystal formulated as [suberic acid]\u00b7[4-bph] (4-bph = N , N \u2032-bis(4-picolinoyl)hydrazine). 3.2 Structural analysis of 1\u20136 3.2.1 [Zn(HBTA) 2 (3-bpo) 2 ](H 2 O) ( 1 ) In complex 1 , each Zn II ion is located at a 2-fold axis and takes a tetrahedral coordination geometry provided by two carboxylate oxygen donors from a pair of HBTA anions and two pyridyl nitrogen atoms from a pair of 3-bpo ligands (see Fig. 1 a). Weak Zn1 \u22ef O2 interaction is also found with the distance of 2.876(4) \u00c5. As for 2-bromoterephthalic acid, only one carboxyl group thereof is deprotonated and involved in metal coordination. Interestingly, each 3-bpo adopts the unusual cisoid- II conformation and the monodentate ligation mode, which has not been observed in the reported complexes [31] . In this way, a mononuclear coordination motif is formed (see Fig. 1 a). As expected, the free carboxyl group of HBTA is hydrogen bonded to the uncoordinated 3-pyridyl group of 3-bpo and thus, each mononuclear molecule is linked to four adjacent ones via such O4\u2013H4 \u22ef N4 interactions to constitute a 2-D (4,4) layer with large rhombic grids, in which the nearest Zn \u22ef Zn separation is 20.790 \u00c5 (see Fig. 1 b left). Three such symmetry-related corrugated layers are entangled in a parallel fashion to result in a 3-fold interpenetrating architecture (see Fig. 1 b right). Moreover, the twisty nature of these layers facilitates the recognition sites for aromatic stacking [40] between the phenyl group in HBTA and uncoordinated pyridyl ring in 3-bpo, with the centroid-to-centroid distance and the dihedral angle of ca. 3.6 \u00c5 and 4.4\u00b0, respectively. As a result, the adjacent 2-D hydrogen-bonding layers are further combined via \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions (see Fig. 1 c left) to afford a 3-D supramolecular framework of 3-fold interpenetration (see Fig. 1 c right). 3.2.2 [Cd(HBTA) 2 (3-bpo) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ](H 2 O) 3. ( 2 ) Each half-occupied Cd II ion in 2 lying on a symmetric center, is six-coordinated by two pyridyl nitrogen donors as well as four oxygen atoms from two carboxylate groups and two water molecules to furnish an octahedral sphere (see Fig. 2 a). A mononuclear coordination motif, which is similar to that in 1 , is also generated in this case. Differently, the incorporation of aqua ligands around the coordination sphere of Cd II leads to the formation of O6\u2013H6B \u22ef O4 and O6\u2013H6A \u22ef O3 hydrogen bonds with the free oxygen atoms of carboxyl and carboxylate, and thus, a 2-D supramolecular layer (see Fig. 2 b) is constructed along the bc plane with the adjacent Cd \u22ef Cd separation of 11.576 \u00c5. Furthermore, the carboxyl group of HBTA is also hydrogen bonded to the uncoordinated pyridyl segment of 3-bpo and such O5\u2013H5 \u22ef N4 interactions extend the 2-D layers into a 3-D network (see Fig. 2 c). In addition, hydrogen-boning interactions are observed between the lattice water molecule of O7 and the lattice water of O8 as well as the carboxylate group (see Table S2 for details), which may stabilize this 3-D framework. Very small interspace is found in this lattice with a volume of 48.9 \u00c5 3 (2.1% of the unit cell volume). 3.2.3 {[M(TBTA)(3-bpo) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ](H 2 O) 2 } n (M = Zn II for 3 , Cd II for 4 , and Co II for 5 ) Single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that complexes 3 \u2013 5 are isostructural, hence only the crystal structure of 3 will be discussed in detail here. Each Zn II ion in 3 is located at an inversion center and takes a similar MN 2 O 4 octahedral sphere to that in 2 (see Fig. 3 a). Notably, the 3-bpo ligand in this structure adopts the transoid conformation and unidentate coordination, and only two similar examples have been found in the 23 known metal complexes with 3-bpo [31] . As a result, the adjacent Zn II ions are connected by the TBTA dianionic bridges to afford a 1-D linear chain along [0 0 1] with the Zn \u22ef Zn distance of 11.533 \u00c5 (see Fig. 3 b), which is also decorated by 3-bpo at both sides to form a fishbone-like motif (see Fig. 3 c). Each water ligand of O4 is hydrogen bonded (see Fig. 3 b) to the adjacent carboxylate within the chain (O4\u2013H4A \u22ef O2) and the lattice water molecule around the chain (O4\u2013H4B \u22ef O5, see Table S2 for details). These 1-D polymeric motifs are arranged in an interdigitated fashion, which makes the interchain aromatic stacking available to direct a layered network (see Fig. 3 c). The centroid-to-centroid distance between the uncoordinated pyridyl group and phenyl ring is ca. 3.6 \u00c5 with the dihedral angle of 5.2\u00b0. Further investigation of the crystal packing demonstrates that aromatic stacking interactions are also present between these 2-D patterns, constructing the final 3-D supramolecular lattice (see Fig. 3 d). The centroid-to-centroid distance and the dihedral angle between the uncoordinated pyridyl and oxadiazole rings are ca. 3.8 \u00c5 and 15.4\u00b0, respectively. 3.2.4 [Pb(TBTA)(3-bph)] n ( 6 ) When the post-transition metal ion Pb II is used in the assembled process, a 2-D coordination polymer is obtained with the observation of in situ hydrolysis of the 3-bpo ligand. In this structure, the Pb II center with 2-fold symmetry shows a distorted octahedral sphere, which is defined by four oxygen atoms from a pair of carboxylate groups and two pyridyl nitrogen donors (see Fig. 4 a). Both the transoid 3-bph ligands and TBTA dianions serve as bidentate spacers to link the Pb II ions into a (4,4) coordination layer (see Fig. 4 b), in which the Pb \u22ef Pb separations bridged by 3-bph and TBTA are 13.856 and 11.713 \u00c5, respectively. Such crooked layers align in a parallel mode along [0 1 0], which are further connected by the interlayer N2\u2013H2 \u22ef O1 bonds (see Table S2 ) to generate a 3-D supramolecular framework (see Fig. 4 c). 3.3 Structural diversity and comparison of 1 \u2013 6 In complexes 1 \u2013 6 , a variety of metallosupramolecular architectures with different propagating and packing fashions are constructed, which should be mainly attributed to substituent effect of the dicarboxyl ligand as well as metal ion. It is beneficial to compare their structural features (see Table 2 ) for further summarizing the role of these impact factors on the assembled processes. Clearly, although the Br-substituted group is normally regarded as the uncoordinated site, the introduction of different amounts of \u2013Br on the backbone of terephthalic acid (one for H 2 BTA and four for H 2 TBTA) does significantly affect the deprotonated degree and binding mode of the ligands in their metal complexes. Generally, the Br-substituent can affect the acidity of terephthalic acid in two manners. On the one hand, as an electron-withdrawing group, the Br-substituent can increase the acidity of \u2013COOH by changing its electron density and stabilizing the negatively charged \u2013COO \u2212 counterpart from the viewpoint of field effect, and this effect will decrease when the distance between the \u2013Br and \u2013COOH groups is increased. On the other hand, due to the steric effect, the \u2013COOH group is forced out of the phenyl plane by the ortho -Br group to make a nearly perpendicular disposition, and then increases its acidity by adjusting the resonance effect. As a result, by combination of such two types of effects, the acidity of ortho -COOH should be stronger than that of the meta -COOH in the Br-substituted aromatic dicarboxyl compounds. Accordingly, the two \u2013COOH groups in H 2 BTA, locating at the ortho - and meta -positions to \u2013Br, display different acidity and thus the deprotonated behavior as well as the deviation degree to the Br-substituted phenyl plane in complexes 1 and 2 (see Table 2 for details). And consequently, the \u2013COOH groups of H 2 TBTA in the resulting complexes uniformly show the carboxylate form and are nearly perpendicular to the Br 4 -substituted phenyl plane (see Table 2 ). The nature of metal ion is also a crucial factor in directing the structural assemblage of these complexes. For example, although both the Zn II and Cd II complexes 1 and 2 have the mononuclear coordination motifs with similar binding modes of the ligands, distinct 3-D supramolecular lattices are formed via secondary interactions, probably due to their different coordination tendency (the incorporation of additional aqua ligands in 2 ). As far as the Zn II , Cd II , and Co II complexes 3 \u2013 5 , the isostructural 1-D coordination arrays should be ascribed to a ligand-directed assembly, while the presence of Pb II ion induces the in situ hydrolysis of 3-bpo to afford a 2-D coordination network based on TBTA and 3-bph linkers. 3.4 Thermal stability of 1\u20136 All complexes are air stable and their thermal stability was explored by TG-DTA technique (see Fig. S1 for TG\u2013DTA curves). The TG curve of 1 shows the first weight loss of 2.23% (calculated: 1.76%) from 90 to 156 \u00b0C, corresponding to the exclusion of one lattice aqua molecule (an endothermic peak at 130 \u00b0C in DTA). The residual component starts to decompose until heating to 250 \u00b0C, which ends at 616 \u00b0C with one endothermic and two exothermic peaks at 263 and 468/543 \u00b0C in the DTA curve. As for 2 , the first weight loss of 7.95% from 44 to 139 \u00b0C in the TG curve suggests the release of all lattice and coordination water molecules (calculated: 7.90%). Accordingly, one endothermic peak is observed at 132 \u00b0C in the DTA curve. Upon further heating to 232 \u00b0C, a series of weight losses occur, which end at 588 \u00b0C (one endothermic peak at 288 \u00b0C and one exothermic peak at 403 \u00b0C in DTA). The resulting residue holds a weight of 10.96% of the total sample and seems to be CdO (calculated: 11.27%). Complex 3 is thermally stable to 160 \u00b0C, where the weight loss occurs and does not end until heating to 700 \u00b0C. Accordingly, one endothermic peak at 223 \u00b0C and three exothermic peaks at 249, 451, and 668 \u00b0C are observed in the DTA curve. The polymeric framework of 4 is stable up to 120 \u00b0C, and then suffers a series of continuous weight losses that end at 690 \u00b0C (one endothermic peak at 200 \u00b0C and two exothermic peaks at 470/660 \u00b0C in DTA). With regard to 5 , the framework remains intact upon heating to 123 \u00b0C, followed by a series of weight losses ending at 612 \u00b0C (two endothermic peaks at 184/276 \u00b0C and one exothermic peak at 468 \u00b0C in the DTA curve). The TGA curve of 6 indicates that the coordination network starts to decompose at 178 \u00b0C with a sharp weight loss ending at 378 \u00b0C. Correspondingly, one endothermic peak and one exothermic peak are observed at 260 and 320 \u00b0C in the DTA curve. Further heating of the remaining substance to 700 \u00b0C reveals a slow and consecutive weight loss with one exothermic peak appearing at 477 \u00b0C in DTA. 4 Conclusion In this work, six new Zn II , Cd II , Co II , and Pb II complexes assembled from the building blocks of Br n -terephthalic acid and 3-bpo are presented. Their discrete, 1-D, and 2-D coordination motifs are further extended by the secondary interactions to construct diversiform 3-D metallosupramolecular architectures, in which the 3-bpo ligands show unusual cisoid- II or transoid conformations. Structural diversity of these complexes can be primarily attributed to the significant substituent effect of the Br n -terephthalic acid tectons as well as the nature of metal ions. These results promote us to make a further systemic study on the coordination chemistry of halogen-substituent dicarboxyl ligands, which may enrich the scope of crystal engineering for supramolecular hybrid solids.

        "title": "Two-dimensional oxalate-bridged heterometallic coordination polymer: Crystal structure and thermal behavior of [NaCr(pyim)(ox)2(H2O)] \u00b7 2H2O (pyim = 2-(2\u2032-pyridyl)imidazole)",
        "abstract": "Two-dimensional sheetlike framework was achieved from the oxalate-bridged heterometallic Cr III \u2013Na I helical chains by self-assembly and structurally characterized. The compound lost the coordination and lattice water at low temperature and the resulting sample kept thermally stable to 633 k. Abstract A new coordination polymer of formula [NaCr(pyim)(ox) 2 (H 2 O)] \u00b7 2H 2 O (pyim = 2-(2\u2032-pyridyl)imidazole, ox = oxalate) has been prepared and it revealed a novel two-dimensional framework generating from the oxalate-bridged heterometallic Cr III \u2013Na I helical chains with alternative P/M arrangement. Within the 2-D layer, a regular alternation of the metal centers is interconnected by two types of oxalate dianions in common bis(bidentate) ligand and an unusual asymmetric monodentate bonding mode towards a sodium atom of a neighboring chain. The thermal behavior of the complex showed that the lattice and coordinated water molecules to Na + were lost at low temperature, and that the resulting anhydrous [NaCr(pyim)(ox) 2 ] is thermally stable at 633 K. Keywords Coordination polymer 2-(2\u2032-Pyridyl)imidazole Helical chain Heterometallic complex Coordination polymers of transition metal oxalates have rapidly developed into an active area of chemical research as a route to functional materials with useful magnetic properties [1\u20134] . So far, a wide range of one-or multi-dimensional infinite solid-state coordination architectures have been achieved by applying [M z+ (ox) 3 ] (6\u2212 z )\u2212 building blocks as useful and versatile bridging ligands in the last four decades [5\u20139] . When one of three oxalates was replaced by a bidentate chelating ligand (AA) [AA = 2,2\u2032-dipyridylamine (dpa); 2,2\u2032-bipyridine (bipy); 1,10-phenanthroline (phen)], a new building block [Cr(AA)(ox) 2 ] \u2212 was formed and applied to construct coordination polymers with the desired topologies and interesting properties [10\u201312] . Following this strategy, attempt to design a new building block [Cr(pyim)(ox) 2 ] \u2212 (pyim = 2-(2-pyridyl)- imidazole) was proved to be rational and successful. In addition, the pyim ligand has potential to form hydrogen-bonding interactions through imidazole ring of the ligand and water molecule to stabilize the supramolecular structure. Herein, the synthesis, crystal structure and thermal behavior of a novel two-dimensional helical coordination polymer, [NaCr(pyim)(ox) 2 (H 2 O)] \u00b7 2H 2 O are described. The ligand pyim was synthesized as reported previously [13] . Reaction of the mixture of pyim and CrCl 3 \u00b7 6H 2 O with Na 2 ox provided crystalline materials analyzing as [NaCr(pyim)(ox) 2 (H 2 O)] \u00b7 2H 2 O [14] . The FT-IR spectrum reveals characteristic bands of the bridging oxalate ligand \u03bd asym (C\u2013O) at 1716s, \u03bd sym (C\u2013O) at 1387s and \u03b4 (O\u2013C\u2013O) at 802m cm \u22121 and of the pyim ligand at 1685s and 1475s cm \u22121 for C N and C C stretching vibrations. The H 2 O-derived O\u2013H stretch is found at 3400b cm \u22121 , which by partial overlaps the imidazyl N\u2013H band at 3103s, and the H\u2013O\u2013H bend is at 1619m cm \u22121 . Determination of the structure of [NaCr(pyim)(ox) 2 (H 2 O)] \u00b7 2H 2 O by X-ray crystallography [15] showed that the complex consists of two-dimensional polymeric units made up of bimetallic oxalate-bridged Cr III \u2013Na I helical chains ( Fig. 1 (a)), which are linked through centrosymmetric Na 2 O 2 units to yield a sheetlike alternative P/M arrangement ( Fig. 1 (b)). The Cr(1) atom in one helix has the same chirality and since the inversion center is located in the middle of the Na 2 O 2 units, the chromium atoms of the neighboring chains have opposite chirality. The infinite neutral sheets are eclipsed to each other and held together by an extensive hydrogen-bonding network involving both coordinated and lattice water molecules, the ligand pyim and half of the oxalate oxygen atoms to contribute to the stabilization of the structure. The stacking of the neutral sheets gives rise to channels of Cr 4 Na 4 octanuclear rings and each resultant hole is occupied by a pair of pyim ligands with partial overlapping [the separation between the mean pyim planes is ca. 3.54 \u00c5] ( Fig. 1 (b)). Within a sheet, four Cr 4 Na 4 rings and four tetranuclear Cr 2 Na 2 rhombuses alternate regularly around each octanuclear Cr 4 Na 4 entity with two C 2 axes passing through the mid point between two opposite chromium atoms. The crystallographically independent chromium Cr(1) and sodium Na(1) atoms bridged by an oxalate anion are present in the complex. The chromium atom is six-coordinated in a distorted octahedral coordination assured by two pyim nitrogen atoms and four oxalate oxygens from two oxalate groups. Bond lengths and angles around Cr(1) compare well with those observed in the analogous complexes [Cr(AA)(ox) 2 ] \u2212 [AA = 2,2\u2032-dipyridylamine (dpa); 2,2\u2032-bipyridine (bipy); 1,10-phenanthroline (phen)] [10\u201312] . The sodium atom is also six-coordinated with a water oxygen atom [2.322(4) \u00c5 for Na(1)\u2013O(9)] and five oxalate oxygens [Na\u2013O bond lengths varying in the range 2.507(3)\u20132.342(3) \u00c5], building a highly distorted octahedral surrounding. The main distortion in the octahedral NaO 6 moiety is associated to the large reductions from the ideal 90\u00b0 value of some bond angles [68.97(12)\u00b0 and 69.20(11)\u00b0 for O(3) #1 \u2013Na(1)\u2013O(4) #1 and O(7)\u2013Na(1)\u2013O(8), respectively. #1:\u2212x + 3/2, y \u2212 1/2, \u2212z + 1/2]. The pyim ligand acts as a bidentate ligand, and does not exhibit significant deviations from planarity [the largest deviation from the mean plane is 0.033(2) \u00c5 at N1] with the dihedral of 2.3\u00b0 between the imidazole and pyridyl rings. Two kinds of bridging oxalate ligands are present in the complex, one adopting only the common bis(bidentate) coordination mode [O(1)C(2)O(4)O(2)C(1)O(3)] and the other [O(5)C(4)O(8)O(6)C(3)O(7)] having an additional monodentate binding site [O(8) atom] to Na + . Because of these structural features, each chromium atom is surrounded by three five-membered chelating rings [from a pyim and two oxalate groups], whereas each sodium atom has around it two five-[from two oxalate groups] and one four-membered chelating rings [Na(1)O(8)Na(1a) #2 O(8a) #2 , #2: \u2212 x + 2, \u2212 y + 1, \u2212 z ] in addition to an aqua ligand. The Na 2 O 2 ring is planar with an inversion center standing at the mid point of sodium\u2013sodium. The oxalate ligands are also planar [the largest deviation is 0.0066(4) \u00c5 at O(7)] and form a dihedral angle of 94.7(1)\u00b0. The dihedral angles between the mean plane of pyim and each oxalate group are 89.1(2)\u00b0 and 89.9(3)\u00b0. The sodium\u2013sodium separation within the Na 2 O 2 ring is 3.750(3) \u00c5 [Na(1)\u2013Na(1a) #2 ], whereas the chromium\u2013sodium distance with the oxalate bridge is 5.673(3) \u00c5. Thermal stability of the complex was studied by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG) as shown in Fig. 2 . In the interval between 303 and 933 K, there are two distinct endotherms observable in a heating mode; the first one at about 364 K, and a larger one with a shoulder at approximately 664 K. Gravimetric integration of the former endotherm data leads to an enthalpy change, \u0394 H , of 1.58 kJ mol \u22121 and an entropy change, \u0394 S , of 4.34 J mol \u22121 K \u22121 at 364 K. The loss in weight (11.6%) suggests that the complex losses three coordinated and uncoordinated water molecules (theoretical calcd. 12.0%). The loses of the aqua ligand at low temperature suggests a weaker Na\u2013O water coordination. The complex loses weight sharply between 633 and 683 K, and then reduces slightly in weight over the range of 683\u2013933 K. It can be concluded that the decomposition of the complex occurs at approximately 663 K. The DSC data show that the complex has a much stronger endothermic peak at ca. 663 K, which can be interpreted as the decomposition of organic components in the complex. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the pristine and dehydration (373 K, 12 h) samples shown in Fig. 3 reveal some slight alterations in the structure of the bulk sample because the reflections of the dehydration sample are in good agreement with those of the pristine phase except that the relative intensities of the reflections change obviously. In summary, this work demonstrates that oxalate anion can be used to prepare a new inorganic\u2013organic hybrid network by self-assembly of the mononuclear [Cr(pyim)(ox) 2 ] \u2212 subunit and sodium ion to afford a 2-D architecture. The inorganic hydrophilic grids are occupied by paralleling pyridyl rings, while the imidazyl rings are above the 2-D sheet. Thermal decomposition of the coordination polymer reveals that both the lattice and the coordinated water molecules to Na + are easy to be lost at 364 K. However, the residence substance, [NaCr(pyim)(ox) 2 ], is thermally stable up to the temperature 633 K. This property may be caused by the pyim ligands, which are parallel to fill the 2-D gridlike framework.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction indicates that these complexes display multifarious binuclear, 1-D, and 2-D coordination motifs in virtue of the bridging polycarboxyl building blocks, in which the bpe ligand uniformly adopts the unidentate coordination by using its 4-pyridyl group. Remarkably, higher-dimensional extended networks are further formed with the aid of additional secondary interactions based on bpe (such as H-bonding and \u03c0 \u2013 \u03c0 stacking).

Abstract New pentacoordinate bicyclodiazastannsulfide fused cyclopentadienyl M\u2013Sn (M = Mo or W) bonded organometallic heterocycle {\u03bc-[C 5 H 4 (CH 3 )C N N C(S)Ar]M(CO) 3 SnCl 2 } has been obtained by the condensation reaction of CH 3 COC 5 H 4 M(CO) 3 SnCl 3 with arylthiocarboxyhydrazide (ArCSNHNH 2 , Ar = 2-furanyl, 2-thienyl, 2- or 4-hydroxyphenyl) in mild conditions. While the similar reaction of CH 3 COC 5 H 4 M(CO) 3 SnCl 3 with ArCONHNH 2 (Ar = 2- or 4-hydroxyphenyl) only gives non-cyclic compound [C 5 H 4 (CH 3 )C N NHC(O)Ar]M(CO) 3 SnCl 3 , in which the tin atom remains tetracoordinate. In bicyclodiazastannsulfide the tin atom prefers to adopt pentacoordinate geometry, while in the corresponding bicyclodiazastannoxide the tin atom is hexacoordinate. In addition, phenylhydrazine, 2- or 4-hydroxyphenylcarboxyhydrazide is used to react with CH 3 COC 5 H 4 M(CO) 3 SnCl 3 , only tetracoordinate non-cyclic tin compound is obtained. Keywords Cyclopentadienyl Tin Group 6 carboxyl metal compound Thicarboxydrazide Heterocycle 1 Introduction The synthesis and reactivity of heterodimetallic complexes with a directed polar metal\u2013metal bond continues to be an active research area in organometallic chemistry due to their unusual structures, reactions and potential catalytic activities [1\u201312] . Among these complexes, M\u2013Sn bonded complexes have drawn special attentions and been extensively investigated owing to their applications in many catalytic processes, which often display good selectivity compared to the mononuclear complexes possibly for the sake of the cooperation effect of two metals. Recently, many achievements have been gained in M Sn bonded complexes, especially Mo\u2013Sn or W\u2013Sn bonded complexes [13\u201324] . Encouraged by the fascinating results we obtained on binuclear tin complexes before, we recently became interested in studying the transition metal\u2013tin bonded heterodimetallic complexes owing to their unusual structural feature and reactivity [25\u201327] . The previous work of our group showed that the reaction of functionalized acetylcyclopentadienyl M\u2013Sn bonded heterodimetallic complexes with phenylhydrazine formed a normal hydrazone, in which the tin atom is tetracoordinate, while their analogous reaction with aroylhydrazine yielded a novel bridging dinuclear bicyclodiazastannoxide [28,29] , in which the tin atom, instead of assuming general pentacoordinate geometry in known bicyclodiazastannoxide analogues [30,31] , prefers to be hexacoordinate through absorbing the chloridion or solvent molecules. It seems that it is difficult to obtain the pentacoordinate tin in these cyclopentadienyl M\u2013Sn bonded heterocycles. Provided the knowledge that the sulfur atom has high affinity for many metals, we found it very intriguing to know if the sulfur atom substituting for the oxygen atom in aroylhydrazine can stabilize the pentacoordinate tin in these cyclopentadienyl M\u2013Sn bonded heterocycles. In this paper we present the results of this study. As we predicted, the reaction of CH 3 COC 5 H 4 M(CO) 3 SnCl 3 (M = Mo and W) with arylthiocarboxyhydrazide provides pentacoordinate bicyclodiazastannsulfide. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Reaction of CH 3 COC 5 H 4 M(CO) 3 SnCl 3 with arylthiocarboxyhydrazide The reaction of CH 3 COC 5 H 4 M(CO) 3 SnCl 3 (M = Mo or W) with arylthiocarboxyhydrazide at room temperature yields bicyclodiazastannsulfides 1 \u2013 6 ( Scheme 1 ). These complexes have low solubility in common organic solvents, moderate solubility in strongly polar solvents such as acetone, DMF and DMSO at room temperature. The complexes have been characterized by element analyses, IR as well as 1 H NMR spectra. No characteristic \u03bd NH peak is observed in their IR spectra. The peak due to O\u2013H stretching has been found at 3352.8 cm \u22121 in 5 and 3326.9 cm \u22121 in 6 , respectively. The \u03bd C N peaks appear around 1638\u20131604 cm \u22121 . The metal carbonyl stretching bands have also been observed in the region of 2037\u20131917 cm \u22121 . Their 1 H NMR spectra demonstrate the structures by exhibiting the expected proton signals, such as two sets of Cp ring resonances, corresponding to the monosubstituted cyclopentadienyl group. Owing to low solubility, only 13 C NMR spectra of complexes 4 and 5 can be observed in satisfactory quality, which indicate two sets of signals of the imino carbon atoms as well as three signals of metal carbonyl carbon atoms. In addition, the 119 Sn NMR signal of 4 in CD 3 SOCD 3 occurs at \u2212347.5 ppm. The structures of 2 , 3 and 5 have been confirmed further by X-ray single crystal diffraction analyses. Their structures are presented in Figs. 1\u20133 , respectively. Although heteroatoms of the aryl groups in these three complexes do not coordinate to the tin atom of adjacent molecules, unlike in analogous bicyclodiazastannoxide fused cyclopentadienyl M\u2013Sn bonded heterocycle [28,29] , the tin atom in complexes 2 , 3 and 5 is pentacoordinate, and has a distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination with one chlorine atom and one nitrogen atom occupying the axial positions. The axial angle of \u2220Cl\u2013Sn\u2013N is very analogous in these complexes (159.6(1)\u00b0 for 2 , 160.6(1)\u00b0 for 3 and 160.66(5)\u00b0 for 5 , respectively). Other geometric features of complexes 2 , 3 and 5 are also markedly different from those of their bicyclodiazastannoxide analogues. For example, five-membered ring of Sn\u2013N\u2013N\u2013C\u2013S remarkably deviates from the coplanarity, with mean deviation from the plane of 0.1340 \u00c5 in 2 , 0.1422 \u00c5 in 3 and 0.1425 \u00c5 in 5 , respectively. In addition, the C N N C moiety in these three complexes is also uncoplanar. The mean deviation from the plane is 0.1338 \u00c5 in 2 , 0.1023 \u00c5 in 3 and 0.1126 \u00c5 in 5 , respectively. The torsion angle of \u2220C\u2013N\u2013N\u2013C (153.5(4)\u00b0 in 2 , \u2212159.5(5)\u00b0 in 3 and \u2212157.6(2)\u00b0 in 5 , respectively) has also indicated that the C N N C moiety has poor coplanarity. It is also noted that the coordination number of tin in complexes 2 , 3 , 5 and the corresponding bicyclodiazastannoxides markedly affects their geometric parameters. Some key bond distances, such as M\u2013Sn, Sn\u2013N, Sn\u2013O, Sn\u2013S and Sn\u2013Cl bond distances, are listed in Table 1 . It can be seen that the W\u2013Sn bond distance (2.7419(5) \u00c5) in 2 is shorter than those in bicyclodiazastannoxide analogues, such as in \u03bc-[C 5 H 4 (CH 3 )C N N C(O)C 6 H 5 ]W(CO) 3 SnCl 2 (EtOH) (complex A , 2.7767(9) \u00c5) [28] , \u03bc-[C 5 H 4 (CH 3 )C N N C(O)C 4 H 3 O]W(CO) 3 SnCl 2 (H 2 O) (complex B , 2.8134(9) \u00c5) [29] , and \u03bc-{[C 5 H 4 (CH 3 )C N N C(O)] 2 C 6 H 4 }{W(CO) 3 SnCl 2 (DMSO)} 2 (complex C , 2.8118(7) \u00c5) [29] . Furthermore, the Mo\u2013Sn bond distances in complexes 3 and 5 are 2.7300(7) \u00c5 and 2.7365(3) \u00c5, respectively, also shorter than that in corresponding bicyclodiazastannoxide analogues, such as {\u03bc-[C 5 H 4 (CH 3 )C N N C(O)PyH]M(CO) 3 SnCl 3 } (complex D , 2.8338(8) \u00c5) [28] . On the other hand, the Sn\u2013N bond distance in these three complexes (2.417(4) \u00c5 in 2 , 2.387(4) \u00c5 in 3 and 2.390(2) \u00c5 in 5 , respectively) is longer than that in the related bicyclodiazastannoxides, such as 2.259(6) \u00c5 in complex B , 2.231(2) \u00c5 in complex D . 2.2 Reaction of CH 3 COC 5 H 4 M(CO) 3 SnCl 3 with o - or p -hydroxyphenylcarboxyhydrazide It is known that the hydroxyl group in phenol, a powerful electron-donating group, can coordinate to the tin atom in many mononuclear bicyclodiazastannoxides [30\u201333] . The observation that the phenolic oxygen atom in complex 5 does not coordinate to the tin atom and the knowledge that the tin atom in bicyclodiazastannoxide usually displays hexacoordinate through absorbing complexing solvent molecules encouraged us to explore whether the phenolic oxygen atom can coordinate to the tin atom in the dinuclear bicyclodiazastannoxides. At the same time, to further confirm the existence of pentacoordinate tin in bicyclodiazastannsulfide as well as the hexacoordinate tin in bicyclodiazastannoxide, the reaction of p -hydroxyphenylcarboxyhydrazide or salicylhydrazide with CH 3 COC 5 H 4 M(CO) 3 SnCl 3 is carried out. However, upon treatment of these two reaction reagents under similar reaction conditions with ArCSNHNH 2 only yields nonbridged complexes 7 \u2013 10 ( Scheme 2 ), in which the benzoylhydrazone does not enolize the \u2013NHCO\u2013 moiety to the N C(OH) moiety. Neither the imino nitrogen atom, nor carbonyl oxygen atom or the phenolic oxygen atom does not coordinate to the tin atom. These complexes also have low solubility in common organic solvents, moderate solubility in strongly polar solvents such as acetone, DMF and DMSO at room temperature. Their IR spectra confirm the tetracoordinate tin complexes having a C N NHC O moiety. The characteristic \u03bd NH peak is observed in the region 3186\u20133289 cm \u22121 . The \u03bd C N peaks appear around 1605\u20131615 cm \u22121 , similar with those in complexes 1 \u2013 6 . In addition, a \u03bd C O absorption band between 1633\u20131648 cm \u22121 is observed in these four complexes. The 13 C NMR spectra of complexes 8 and 10 can be clearly observed, which display one signal of the carbonyl carbon atom (168.4 ppm in 8 and 166.9 ppm in 10 , respectively) as well as one signal of the imino carbon atom (159.5 ppm in 8 and 160.6 ppm in 10 , respectively). The structure of complex 10 has also been confirmed by X-ray single crystal diffraction analyses. As seen in Fig. 4 , the tin atom is tetracoordinate with a distorted tetrahedral geometry, similar with that in [C 5 H 4 (CH 3 )C N NHC(O)(C 6 H 3 (NO 2 ) 2 )]Mo(CO) 3 SnCl 3 (complex E ) [28] , and the SnCl 3 group is away from the aroylhydrazone moiety. The cooperation effects of several factors maybe result in the formation of the non-cyclic tetracoordinate tin complex rather than a bridging penta- or hexacoordinate tin complex. With such a weaker donor of the oxygen atom compared with the sulfur atom, the electron-donating hydroxyl group of phenol weakening the enolizability of the \u2013NHCO\u2013 moiety to the N C(OH) moiety. In addition, the large strain maybe exists in the corresponding bicyclodiazastannoxide, if formed. Compared with the pentacoordinate tin complex 2 and the hexacoordinate tin complexes A , B and C , the tetracoordinate tin complex 10 has shorter W\u2013Sn bond distance (2.7138(9) \u00c5) (see Table 1 ). The Sn\u2013Cl bond distances in complex 10 are similar to those in the tetracoordinate tin complex E , but shorter than those in penta- and hexacoordinate tin complexes. These short bond distances obviously arise from the increment of the coordination number of the tin atom weakening the bonding between the Sn\u2013Cl as well as the Sn\u2013M. Combined with previous work, it seems that the tin atom prefers to be pentacoordinate in these heterobimetallic bicyclodiazastannsulfides; while in corresponding bicyclodiazastannoxide analogues, it is usually hexacoordinate. However, when salicylhadrazide, p -hydroxyphenylcarboxyhydrazide and phenylhydrazine are used to react with CH 3 COC 5 H 4 M(CO) 3 SnCl 3 , only non-cyclic tetracoordinate tin complexes are obtained. Furthermore, the structural feature of the tin center in these heterobimetallic complexes significantly depends on the coordination number of the tin atom. 3 Experimental Solvents were dried by the standard methods prior to use. All reactions were carried out under an argon atmosphere using standard Schlenk and Cannula techniques. NMR spectra were obtained with a Mercury 300BB or Bruker AV300 spectrometer, and the chemical shifts were reported in ppm with respect to the reference. IR spectra data were obtained from a Bio-Rad FTS 135 spectrometer using KBr discs. Element analyses were carried out on a Perkin\u2013Elmer 2400 C analyzer.

The reaction mixture was stirred continuously for 2 h at room temperature, during which a yellow precipitate was formed gradually.

        "abstract": "This work presents eight coordination assemblies based on divalent metal ions (M = CoII, CuII, ZnII, and Cd II), dicyanamide anion (N(CN)2 -, dca), and two isomeric bent dipyridyl coligands (L), namely, 2,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1,3,4- oxadiazole (3-bpo) and 2,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (4-bpo). In the resulting crystalline materials, both bpo and dca tectons generally display the bidentate bridging fashion (except in the mononuclear species 5), extending the metal centers to afford diverse one-, two-, and three-dimensional (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D) coordination networks that are not commonly observed inM-dca-L systems. Notably, the inclined polycatenated 2-D \u2192 3-D framework and 3-D polyknotting network with the unique 6-connected (44.611) topology are formed for the CuII and CdII species with dca and 4-bpo. For the polymeric CoII and CuII complexes, very weak antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic interactions are observed between themetal centers due to the \u03bc1,5-bridgingmode of dca, and their magneto-structural correlations have been discussed in detail. The Zn II and CdII complexes show solid-state fluorescent emissions at room temperature. \u00a9 2010 American Chemical Society.",

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction indicates that these complexes show 1-D tube-like (for CuII complexes 1 and 2) or discrete cage-like dinuclear (for CoII and NiII complexes 3-6) coordination patterns. Furthermore, extended 3-D supramolecular architectures are constructed via secondary interactions between the coordination arrays, and three types of packing fashions are observed for the dinuclear species 3-6. Structural diversification for these complexes can be properly attributed to the inherent discrepancy of metal ions and the substituent effect of R-isophthalate tectons. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "Two novel diazamesocyclic ligands based on 1,5-diazacyclooctane (DACO) and functionalized with additional pyridyl donor groups, namely 1,5-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)-1,5-diazacyclooctane (L1) and 1-(2-pyridylmethyl)-1,5-diazacyclooctane (L2), have been synthesized and characterized, as have their CuII complexes. Crystal structure analyses revealed that with Cu(ClO4)2 L1 forms a five-coordinate mononuclear complex [CuIIL1Cl]ClO4 (1), whereas L2 forms a \u03bc-Cl--bridged dinuclear complex [CuII(L2)Cl]2(ClO4)2 (2). Furthermore, it has been found that the apical chloride anion of 1 may be easily exchanged by azide anion, forming the mononuclear complex [CuIIL1(N3)]ClO4 (3). There is a notable difference between 3 and 1 in that 3 forms a quasi-two-dimensional network through intermolecular C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions. Each CuII center in the three complexes is pentacoordinated in a distorted square-pyramidal environment and the DACO ring of each ligand adopts a boat-chair configuration in all the complexes. In the mononuclear complexes 1 and 3, the Cl- or N3 - anions occupy the apical sites, whereas in the dinuclear complex 2 the two bridging Cl- anions occupy both axial positions as well as one equatorial position, leading to an intramolecular Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu separation of 3.396 \u00c5. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements on 2 in the range 4-300 K indicate a weak intramolecular ferromagnetic coupling between adjacent CuII centers with 2J = 2.28 cm-1; the magneto-structural correlations are discussed in detail. The solution behavior of the complexes has been further studied by UV/vis and ESR techniques.",

Single-crystal X-ray analysis showed that complexes 1, 2, and 4 exhibit 2D layer frameworks, and 3, 5, 6, and 8 have 1D chain structures, while 7 is a 3D coordination network. In these polymers, a variety of geometries of AgI and coordination modes of the organic ligands were observed due to the different numbers and relative orientation of N donors in the terminal groups of these ligands. In addition, the influences of counteranions and solvent coordination on the framework formations have been discussed. These results indicate that both steric and electronic effects of the ligands play important roles in affecting the structural topologies of such metal-organic coordination architectures.",

In all the mononuclear complexes, each Co II center is penta-coordinated to four nitrogen donors of the ligand and one axial chloride anion. The crystal structure of complex 2 has been determined by X-ray diffraction analysis, which forms a one-dimensional linear structure through inter-molecular C\u2013H\u22efCl and C\u2013H\u22efO hydrogen-bonding.",

The Cu II centre is penta-coordinated in square pyramidal geometry and the diazacycloheptane (DACH) ring adopts normal boat configuration.

        "abstract": "A series of 2D Ln-organic coordination frameworks (Ln = Sm 3+ for 1 , Eu 3+ for 2 , Tb 3+ for 3 , and Ho 3+ for 4 ) with (4,6)-connected (4 4 .5 2 )(4 4 .5.6)(4 4 .5 4 .6 6 .7) topology has been constructed, in which 1D zigzag chains and 2D (4,4) networks intertwine mutually into the unusual 1D and 2D mixed self-weaving patterns. Interestingly, due to the lanthanide contraction effect, the 9-coordinated geometries of the Ln(III) ions gradually transform from triangle tetrakaidecahedron (Sm 3+ and Eu 3+ ), to a three-capped triangle prism (Eu 3+ and Tb 3+ ), and then to a single-capped anti-square prism (Ho 3+ ). Graphical Abstracts Four Ln-organic coordination frameworks (Ln = Sm 3+ , Eu 3+ , Tb 3+ , and Ho 3+ ) with (4,6)-connected (4 4 .5 2 )(4 4 .5.6)(4 4 .5 4 .6 6 .7) topology are described, in which 1D zigzag chains and 2D (4,4) networks intertwine mutually into an unusual 1D and 2D mixed self-weaving motif. Lanthanide contraction effect is also observed to regulate the coordinated geometries of Ln(III) and the overall 3D lattices. Research Highlights \u25ba In this manuscript, we report a series of 2D Ln-organic coordination frameworks (Ln = Sm 3+ for 1 , Eu 3+ for 2 , Tb 3+ for 3 , and Ho 3+ for 4 ) with (4,6)-connected (4 4 .5 2 )(4 4 .5.6)(4 4 .5 4 .6 6 .7) topology, in which 1D zigzag chains and 2D (4,4) networks intertwine mutually into the unusual 1D&2D mixed self-weaving patterns. \u25ba Interestingly, due to the lanthanide contraction effect, the 9-coordinated geometries of the Ln(III) ions gradually transform from triangle tetrakaidecahedron (Sm 3+ and Eu 3+ ), to three-capped triangle prism (Eu 3+ and Tb 3+ ), and then to single-capped anti-square prism (Ho 3+ ). \u25ba In this point, the 1,3-pda ligand shows an excellent potential in the formation of new Ln 3+ coordination frameworks. Also, the 1D&2D mixed self-weaving architectures observed herein provide new perspectives in Ln-carboxylate coordination chemistry. Additionally, thermal stability and fluorescence of these new materials have also been studied. \u25ba These results will enrich the current research of the flexible ligand on constructing Ln-coordination polymers and provide new insights into its application in designing such crystalline materials with desired structures and properties. Keywords Lanthanide(III) complexes Crystal structures Luminescent properties Crystal engineering of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has evoked increasing interests for chemists and material scientists, due to their unusual topologies and profuse applications in optics, electricity, magnetism, gas storage, sorption, catalysis, etc. [1,2] . As a result, many fascinating coordination architectures, such as polycatenane, polyrotaxane, polythreading, polyknotting, molecular braid, borromean ring, and other unusual structural patterns, have been obtained [3,4] . However, in contrast to transition metal-organic frameworks (TMOFs), to design and control over lanthanide metal-organic frameworks (LMOFs) is a difficult and challenging task in view of the higher coordination numbers and variable coordination environments of Ln ions. In fact, lanthanide ions with the specific characters mentioned earlier will offer unique opportunities for the discovery of intriguing LMOFs [5] . In this context, aromatic multicarboxylate ligands, especially rigid dicarboxylate species, such as 1,2-, 1,3-, and 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (bdc), have been frequently used to construct LMOFs relying on their conjugated \u03c0 backbones and rich coordination modes as well as the high oxo-affinity of lanthanide [6] . In contrast, although the flexible phenylenediacetate (pda) ligands, also with three isomers (1,2-, 1,3-, and 1,4-pda), have been applied as building blocks to build some novel TMOFs [7] , they have received less attention for LMOFs assemblies. Our previous work has demonstrated that pda may take versatile coordination fashions and act as effective bridging ligands for constructing diverse coordination networks, such as the 1D zigzag chain, 1D helical chain, 1D rampart-shaped chain, 1D tube-shaped chain, 2-fold interpenetrating (4,4) net, and 3D heterochiral helical array [8] . Inspired by the previous results, we will report here four novel Ln 3+ coordination polymers with 1,3-pda, i.e. {[Sm 2 (1,3-pda) 3 (H 2 O) 3 ]\u00b7(H 2 O) 4 } n ( 1 ), {[Eu 2 (1,3-pda) 3 (H 2 O) 3 ]\u00b7(H 2 O) 4 } n ( 2 ), {[Tb 2 (1,3-pda) 3 (H 2 O) 3 ]\u00b7(H 2 O) 3 } n ( 3 ), and {[Ho 2 (1,3-pda) 3 (H 2 O) 3 ]\u00b7(H 2 O)} n ( 4 ). All complexes have the unusual (4,6)-connected 1D and 2D mixed self-weaving architectures. Additionally, thermal stability and fluorescence of these new materials have also been studied. The yellowy block crystals of {[Sm 2 (1,3-pda) 3 (H 2 O) 3 ]\u00b7(H 2 O) 4 } n ( 1 ) were prepared by the reaction of Sm(III) nitrate with 1,3-pda under hydrothermal conditions\u00a0 [9] . Complexes 2 , 3 , 4 were prepared by the similar method as that of 1 , except for using different lanthanide nitrates (Eu(NO 3 ) 3 \u2219(H 2 O) 6 for 2 , Tb(NO 3 ) 3 \u2219(H 2 O) 6 for 3 , and Ho(NO 3 ) 3 \u2219(H 2 O) 6 for 4 ) [10] . Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 have similar structures. Therefore, only the structure of 1 will be discussed in detail as a representative. In 1 , there are two crystallographically independent Sm 3+ ions with the 9-coordinated distorted triangle tetrakaidecahedron geometries (see Fig. S1\u2020 ). Sm1 is coordinated by four O atoms (O8, O9, O10, and O11) of two chelating carboxylates, two O atoms (O19 and O16) of two bridging carboxylates, and three O atoms (O4, O5, and O6) of different water ligands. Sm2 is surrounded by six O atoms (O12, O13, O14, O15, O18, and O19) of three chelating carboxylates, two O atoms (O9 and O11) of two \u03bc 2 -\u03b7 2 :\u03b7 1 carboxylates and the last one (O17) of one bridging carboxylate. The Sm\u2013O distances range from 2.367 to 2.717 \u00c5, and the O\u2013Sm\u2013O angles range from 49.60(7) to 155.73(7)\u00b0, which are similar to those found in other related examples [11] . Complex 4 has poor crystal quality, although we have repeated the experiments for many times. Further details for structural analysis are summarized in Table S1 . Selected bond lengths and angles are shown in Tables S2 and S3 . H-bonding parameters are listed in Table S4 . The 1,3-pda 2\u2212 ligands in 1 adopt three types of coordination modes, namely, trans -bis( \u03bc 2 -\u03b7 2 :\u03b7 1 ) A , trans - \u03bc 4 -(\u03b7 2 :\u03b7 1 )-(\u03b7 1 :\u03b7 1 ) B , and cis -bis(chelated) C ( Fig.\u00a01 ). Interestingly, the 1,3-pda 2\u2212 ligands in mode B serve as spacers and all Sm1 ions act as nodes, resulting in a [-Sm1-pda-Sm1-pda-] n zigzag chain ( Fig.\u00a02 a ). In contrast, through the 1,3-pda 2\u2212 ligands in modes A and C , the Sm2 centers are linked to build a (4,4) network with the dimensions of 8.363 \u00c5 \u00d7 12.660 \u00c5 ( Fig.\u00a02 b). To our surprise, the 1D zigzag chains and 2D nets interweave each other into an unusual 1D and 2D self-weaving architecture ( Fig.\u00a02 c). To date, several types of 1D + 2D \u2192 2D entangling networks have been documented [12] , and as far as we know, such a 1D and 2D self-weaving pattern has never been observed in coordination polymers. From the topological view, each Sm1 is a 6-connected node and each Sm2 is a 4-connected one. Also, the 1,3-pda 2\u2212 ligands, in coordination modes A and B , can be viewed as the 4-connected nodes, and the other 1,3-pda ligands in mode C act as the 2-connected spacers. As a result, a unique trinodal 2D coordination network with (4,6)-connectivity is afforded ( Fig.\u00a03 ), with the Schl\u00e4fli symbol of (4 4 .5 2 )(4 4 .5.6)(4 4 .5 4 .6 6 .7). Another diverting feature of 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 is the lanthanide contraction effect that causes two noticeable structural variations. First, the geometries of Ln 3+ ions vary from the distorted triangle tetrakaidecahedron (Sm1, Sm2, and Eu1), to a distorted three-capped triangle prism (Eu2, Tb1, and Tb2), and then to a distorted single-capped anti-square prism (Ho1 and Ho2) ( Fig.\u00a04 ). Second, although the coordination frameworks [Ln 2 (1,3-pda) 3 (H 2 O) 3 ] of 2 , 3 , 4 are similar to that of 1 , the lattice water molecules thereof are gradually decreased due to the deflating of interlayer space voids arising from the lanthanide contraction effect. In the structures of 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , the 2D coordination motifs are extended to form 3D supramolecular lattices by different secondary interactions, that is, the triangle 3H-bonding and tetrahedral 4H-bonding for 1 , the V-shaped 2H-bonding and tetrahedral 4H-bonding for 2 , the tetrahedral 4H-bonding for 3 , and \u03c0 \u00b7 \u03c0 stacking for 4 . In 1 , the lattice water of O7 acts as the donor of one H-bonding and acceptor of two H-bonding, affording a triangle 3H-bonding geometry, whereas the lattice water molecules of O2 and O3 adopt the tetrahedral 4H-bonding geometry, each serving as the double donor and double acceptor of four H-bonding ( Fig.\u00a05 ), which thus, result in a chair-like ten-number water ring with four arms to interlink the adjacent 2D layers. As for 2 , the lattice water of O18 adopts the V-shaped 2H-bonding geometry as both donor and acceptor, and that of O16 takes the tetrahedral 4H-bonding geometry as double donor and double acceptor of H-bonding. For 3 , the lattice water of O18 acts as double donor and double acceptor of H-bonding, leading to a distorted tetrahedral mode. The O \u00b7 O distances of the aforementioned interactions range from 2.724 to 2.925 \u00c5, with an average value of 2.799 \u00c5, and the O \u00b7 O \u00b7 O angles vary from 82.5 to 138.6\u00b0, which are comparable to those observed in the ice II phase (2.77\u20132.84 \u00c5) [11] . Different from 1 , 2 , 3 , in 4 , significant \u03c0 \u00b7 \u03c0 interactions (Cg \u00b7 Cg = 3.80 \u00c5) occur between the adjacent interlayer 1,3-pda ligands. In order to confirm the phase purity of the bulk materials, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded at room temperature for 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 (see Fig. S2\u2020 ). Compared to the simulated patterns from the single crystal data, though the experimental patterns have a few unindexed diffraction peaks and some peaks are slightly broadened, we can conclude that the bulk as-synthesized crystalline materials represent complexes 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 due to their adequate similarity. Besides, the purity of these complexes can also be supported from the elemental analysis. Thermal stability of 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under air atmosphere in 30\u2013800 \u00b0C region at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min (see Fig. S3\u2020 for TGA curves ). For 1 , the first and second weight losses of 7.35% (calcd: 7.18%) and 5.56% (calcd: 5.38%) from 30 to 202 \u00b0C indicate the removing of four lattice and three coordination water molecules, respectively. The final stage can be considered as the decomposition of anhydrous composition to yield samarium oxide. The pyrolysis processes of 2 , 3 , 4 are different from that of 1 , with only two steps: (i) the elimination of coordinated and lattice solvents and (ii) a complete decomposition of the residual composition. The excitation and emission spectra of 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 in solid state at room temperature are presented in Fig. S4\u2020 . For 1 , three emission peaks of 547, 594, and 624 nm can be attributed to 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 5/2 , 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 7/2 , and 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 9/2 transitions of Sm 3+ , which are lower than the characteristic ones of Sm 3+ due to the coordination to 1,3-pda [13] . Complex 2 shows the maximal emission at 621 nm, corresponding to 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 transition of the Eu 3+ ions. The additional peaks at 595, 621, and 701 nm correspond to 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 1 , 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 , and 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 4 transitions of Eu 3+ . The intensity ratio of 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 / 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 1 is 2.3, indicating the absence of an inversion center. When excited at 491 nm for 3 , it emits green luminescence. The emission peaks at 549, 587, and 624 nm correspond to 5 D 4 \u2192 7 F 5 , 5 D 4 \u2192 7 F 4 , and 5 D 4 \u2192 7 F 3 transitions of the Tb 3+ ions [14] . In addition, the free ligand 1,3-pda has a broad emission at 504 nm, which however disappears for 1 , 2 , 3 and such a ligand fluorescence quenching may be caused by its coordination to Ln 3+ . However, complex 4 does not display the characteristic emission of Ho 3+ , and the resulting strong peaks at 358 and 381 nm may be attributed to the low efficient and large blue-displaced emissions of ligands. From the aforementioned results, we may conclude that 1 , 2 , 3 exhibit the characteristic emissions of metal, mainly because of the energy matching between the triple state T 1 of 1,3-pda and the f \u2013 f electric transition \u0394 E f of Ln 3+ , which results in the efficient energy transfer. In contrast for 4 , the unmatched energy between 1,3-pda and Ho 3+ leads to the L *\u2192 L ligand emission, which is slightly interfered by Ho 3+ . In summary, the 1,3-pda ligand, with three different coordination fashions, can extend the Ln 3+ ions into unusual (4,6)-connected self-weaving networks with (4 4 .5 2 )(4 4 .5.6)(4 4 .5 4 .6 6 .7) topology, in which the coordination geometries of Ln 3+ and the 3D packing lattices are also regulated by the lanthanide contraction effect. In this point, the 1,3-pda ligand shows an excellent potential in the formation of new Ln 3+ coordination frameworks. Also, the 1D and 2D mixed self-weaving architectures observed herein provide new perspectives in Ln-carboxylate coordination chemistry.

All these compounds were structurally determined by X-ray single-crystal diffraction, and the bulk new materials were further identified by X-ray powder diffraction. Complexes 1 and 6 show 1-D zigzag or linear Htma-bridged polymeric chains, with the terminal bpt ligands as pendants, which are extended to 2-D hydrogen-bonded arrays with 4.82 or (6,3) network topology. Coordination polymers 2 and 3, in which the 2-D corrugated metal-organic frameworks make the interdigitated 3-D packing, are isostructural. Complex 4 has a mononuclear structure, and its subunits are hydrogen-bonded to each other to give a 2-D gridlike net. For complex 5, the CdII centers are linked by bpt/Htma ligands to form a 2-D (4,4) coordination layer, and these layers are interdigitated in pairs. Notably, secondary noncovalent forces, such as hydrogen bonds, play an important role in extending and stabilizing these structural topologies. Interestingly, distinct products are obtained for CoII (1 and 2) and CdII (5 and 6) under ambient or hydrothermal conditions; however, for NiII and ZnII, single products, 3 and 4, are generated. The thermal stabilities of 1-6 were studied by thermogravimetric analysis of mass loss. The desorption/adsorption properties of the porous material 5 are also discussed. Solid-state luminescent spectra of the Zn II and CdII complexes, 4-6, indicate intense fluorescent emissions at ca. 380 nm. \u00a9 2006 American Chemical Society.",

The crystal structure reveals that 1 has a 3D noninterpenetrating open framework with guest CH3CN molecules in the cavities, in which the CdII centers (with CdN4S2 octahedral geometry) are bridged by the bpo molecules and SCN- groups. It is interesting that the two-dimensional sheet in this 3D network consists of 16-membered [Cd4(\u03bc-SCN-N,S)4] rings, and the bpo molecules extend these layers to a 3D structure, which is further stabilized by C-H\u22efN hydrogen-bonding and strong \u03c0-\u03c0-stacking interactions. Thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray powder diffraction technique measurements illustrate that the framework of 1 is retained upon removal of the uncoordinated guest acetonitrile molecules, indicating that 1 might be used to generate microporous material.",

        "abstract": "The complexes of Cu(I), Cu(II), Ni(II), Zn(II) and Co(II) with a new polypyridyl ligand, 2,3-bis(2-pyridyl)-5,8-dimethoxyquinoxaline (L), have been synthesized and characterized. The crystal structures of these complexes have been elucidated by X-ray diffraction analyses and three types of coordination modes for L were found to exist in them. In the dinuclear complex [Cu(I)L(CH3CN)]2\u00b7(ClO4)2 (1), L acts as a tridentate ligand with two Cu(I) centers bridged by two L ligands to form a box-like dimeric structure, in which each Cu(I) ion is penta-coordinated with three nitrogen atoms and a methoxyl oxygen atom of two L ligands, and an acetonitrile. In [Cu(II)L(NO3)2] \u00b7CH3CN 2, the Cu(II) center is coordinated to the two nitrogen atoms of the two pyridine rings of L which acts as a bidentate ligand. The structures of [Ni(II)L(NO3)(H2O)2] \u00b72CH3CN\u00b7NO3 (3), [Zn(II)L(NO 3)2 (H2O)]\u00b72CH3CN (4) and [Co(II)LCl2(H2O)] (5) are similar to each other in which L acts as a tridentate ligand by using its half side, and the metal centers are coordinated to a methoxyl oxygen atom and two bipyridine nitrogen atoms of L in the same side. The formation of infinite quasi-one-dimensional chains (1, 4 and 5) or a quasi-two-dimensional sheet (2) assisted by the intra- or intermolecular face-to-face aryl stacking interactions and hydrogen bonds may have stabilized the crystals of these complexes. Luminescence studies showed that 1 exhibits broad, structureless emissions at 420 nm in the solid state and at 450 nm in frozen alcohol frozen glasses at 77 K. Cyclic voltammetric studies of 1 show the presence of an irreversible metal-centered reduction wave at approximately -0.973 V versus Fc+/0 and a quasi-reversible ligand-centered reduction couple at approximately -1.996 V versus Fc +/0. The solution behaviors of these complexes have been further studied by UV-Vis and ESR techniques. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

The 3D supramolecular framework is also stabilized by significant face-to-face \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions between the aromatic pyridinium systems. Keywords Hydrothermal synthesis Crystal structure Hydrogen-bonding interaction Aromatic stacking Supramolecular compound 1 Introduction The rapid development in crystal engineering of metal-involved supramolecular architectures assembled by means of coordination bonds, hydrogen bonds or other weak intermolecular interactions continues to produce various structures with interesting compositions and topologies, along with potential applications as a new class of functional solid materials [1\u20138] . Meanwhile, the preparation of various supramolecular compounds helps to obtain new information of intermolecular interactions, which is apparently important for rational design and construction of desired architectures. Currently, a lot of researchers are focusing their attention on the crystal engineering of supramolecular architectures organized by coordination covalent bonds or hydrogen bonds and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions [1\u20138] . In particular, the hydrogen-bonding interaction has attracted most interest due to its relative strength and directional properties [9] in generating a great variety of one-, two-, and three-dimensional either non-interpenerating open networks with variable cavities or channels of desired sizes [10,11] or well-entangled structures through interpeneration [12,13] . Proper selection of metal ions and ligands with suitable functionalized groups is the key issue in designing and self-assembling of coordination supramolecules equipped with peripheral hydrogen-bonding subunits [11] . Amongst the synthetic strategies in the context of coordination chemistry, one of the most fruitful choices is taking advantage of ligand molecule such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (H 4 EDTA), which possess diverse functional groups and could give more possibility to form hydrogen bonds. Meanwhile, Zn 2+ ion could easily coordinates with carboxylic O and pyridyl N donor groups. Moreover, the coordination chemistry of oxadiazole-containing dipyridyl ligands, such as 2,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole ( L 1 ) and 2,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole ( L 2 ), have been of our recent research interests for their unique versatile bonding-modes and strong capability of forming hydrogen-bonding interactions [14\u201320] . Thus, we anticipate that the incorporation of both interesting organic subunits would lead to fascinating coordination supramolecules upon metal complexation. To our surprise, a novel hydrogen-bonding supramolecular compound [Zn(H 2 EDTA)(H 2 O)](Q) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ( 1 ) was obtained under mild hydrothermal condition, in which Zn II ion is chelated to H 2 EDTA (as an anionic ligand) and the hydrolysis of L 1 leads to the opening of the central oxadiazole ring to give 4-(carboxylate)pyridinium (Q) during this course. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and general methods With the exception of the bridging ligand 2,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole ( L 1 ), which was synthesized according to reported literature procedure [21] , all of the starting materials and solvents for syntheses and analyses were obtained commercially and used as received. FT-IR spectra (KBr pellets) were taken on an AVATAR-370 (Nicolet) spectrometer and carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen analyses were performed on a CE-440 (Leemanlabs) analyzer. Thermal stability analysis (TGA) experiment was carried out on a Dupont thermal analyzer from room temperature to 800 \u00b0C under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . 2.2 Synthesis of complex 1 An aqueous solution (10 ml) containing Zn(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O (29.8 mg, 0.1 mmol), L 1 (22.4 mg, 0.1 mmol) and H 4 EDTA (29.2 mg, 0.1 mmol) was placed in a Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (20 ml) under autogenous pressure, which was heated to 145 \u00b0C for 72 h, and then cooled to room temperature at the rate of 5 \u00b0C h \u22121 . Colorless rhombus-like crystalline products were collected in 43% yield. Found: C, 40.43; H, 4.25; N, 8.47%. Calc. for C 22 H 30 N 4 O 15 Zn: C, 40.29; H, 4.61; N, 8.54%.

The determination of unit cell parameters and data collections (in the range of 2.78< \u03b8 <25.08\u00b0) were performed with Mo K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb =0.71073 \u00c5) by \u03d6 scan mode at 293(2) K. All data were corrected by semi-empirical method using sadabs program. The program saint [22] was used for integration of the diffraction profiles. The structure was solved by direct methods using shelxs program of the shelxl -97 package and refined with shelxl [23] . Zn II center was located from the E -map and other non-hydrogen atoms were located in successive difference Fourier syntheses. The final refinements were performed by full matrix least-squares methods with anisotropic thermal parameters for non-hydrogen atoms on F 2 . All the hydrogen atoms were first found in difference electron density maps, and then placed in the calculated sites and included in the final refinement in the riding model approximation with displacement parameters derived from the parent atoms to which they were bonded. The ratio of minimum to maximum apparent transmission is 0.8400. Molecular graphics were drawn with the program package diamond (Version 2.1c) [24] . Further crystallographic data and experimental details for structural analysis are summarized in Table 1 , and positional parameters and atomic coordinates are listed in Table 2 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Description of the crystal structure of complex 1 The molecular and supramolecular structure of compound 1 was revealed by an X-ray single-crystal structure determination. Each independent crystallographic unit contains half [Zn(H 2 EDTA)(H 2 O)] neutral subunit, one 4-(carboxylate)pyridinium molecule and one lattice water, as shown in Fig. 1 . For the [Zn(H 2 EDTA)(H 2 O)] coordinated moiety, Zn(1) and O(5) atoms are located in the special sites with 0.5 occupancy and the H 2 EDTA ligand is related by a C 2 axis through Zn(1)\u2013O(5). The Zn II center is chelated by two nitrogen atoms [Zn(1)\u2013N(1)=2.215(3) \u00c5] and two oxygen donors from two carboxylate groups [Zn(1)\u2013O(3)=2.063(3) \u00c5] of the tetradentate H 2 EDTA ligand, and one additional water molecule [Zn(1)\u2013O(4)=2.048 \u00c5]. Thus, the coordination polyhedron for Zn II could be best described as a distorted trigonal-bipyramid with the \u03c4 value of 0.65, which is defined by Addison et al. [25] to describe the degree of distortion for the coordination environment of penta-coordinated complex ( \u03c4 =1 for an ideal trigonal-bipyramid and \u03c4 =0 for an ideal square-pyramid). Two carboxylate O(3) and O(3A) atoms act as the axis with the O\u2013Zn\u2013O angle of 178.42(15)\u00b0, and the other three coordinated donors consist of the basal plane (Zn II ion is completely located in this coordination plane due to the symmetry). It should be noted that although only two carboxylic groups of H 2 EDTA are deprotonated and coordinate to the Zn II center, weak interactions between Zn II and the other two carboxylic groups are also observed with Zn(1)\u2013O(1) distance of 2.588(4) \u00c5. Selected bond lengths and angles for 1 are listed in Table 3 . For carboxylic groups in H 2 EDTA, the C(3)\u2013O(2) length [1.289(4) \u00c5] is significantly longer than that of C(3)\u2013O(1) [1.214(4) \u00c5], and for the carboxylate group, the coordinated C(5)\u2013O(3) bond length [1.262(4) \u00c5] is longer than that of the uncoordinated C(5)\u2013O(4) bond [1.239(4) \u00c5], agreeing with their structural features. For the guest molecule 4-(carboxylate)pyridinium in the lattice, one hydrogen atom is located on the pyridine nitrogen group, which was determined according to the comparison of the final refinement results. Additionally, two C\u2013O bond distances of the carboxylate group are almost equivalent [1.242(4) vs. 1.254(5) \u00c5], which further confirms this conclusion. Analysis of the crystal packing of complex 1 in the unit cell shows that there exist multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions, resulting in a novel three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular network. All the relevant hydrogen-bonding values and the symmetry codes are listed in Table 4 . As shown in Fig. 2 , each coordinated water molecule in [Zn(H 2 EDTA)(H 2 O)] forms a pair of intramolecular O(5)\u2013H(5A)\u22efO(8) bonds with two adjacent lattice water molecules. Meanwhile, each lattice water also form an intermolecular O(8)\u2013H(8A)\u22efO(4) i ( i = x \u22121/2, y \u22121/2, z ) interaction with the uncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atom of the neighboring [Zn(H 2 EDTA)(H 2 O)] subunit. Thus, the lattice water molecules connect the mononuclear subunits through two types of O\u2013H\u22efO hydrogen bonds to form a 2D layered structure along (110) plane (see Fig. 2 ). The resulting motif of the closed repeating unit of this 2D structure, in the formalism of graph-set analysis of hydrogen-bond patterns [26] , is characterized as N 8 = R 8 8 (30). Further analysis of the packing mode of these 2D layers indicates that they adopt the anti-parallel packing along [001] direction (see Fig. 3 ) . The 4-(carboxylate)pyridinium guest moieties are inside in the space among these 2D layers, as shown in Fig. 3 . Each lattice water molecule and [Zn(H 2 EDTA)(H 2 O)] subunit in the 2D layer also forms the intermolecular O(8)\u2013H(8B)\u22efO(6) i and O(2)\u2013H(2)\u22efO(7) ii bonds, respectively, with two oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group of 4-(carboxylate)pyridinium. Meantime, the carboxylate oxygen atoms of [Zn(H 2 EDTA)(H 2 O)] act as the acceptors in the N(2)\u2013H(2C)\u22efO(4) iii and N(2)\u2013H(2C)\u22efO(3) iii hydrogen bonds with the the N\u2013H active group in 4-(carboxylate)pyridinium. Thus, these 2D layers are further linked into an interesting sawtooth-like 3D supramolecular architecture by 4-(carboxylate)pyridinium molecules through O\u2013H\u22efO and N\u2013H\u22efO hydrogen-bonding interactions. For all the hydrogen bonds stated above, the bond geometries are in the normal range for such weak interactions [27] . Additionally, the closest approach between two adjacent parallel 4-(carboxylate)pyridinium molecules is only 3.22 \u00c5 with a center-to-center distance of 3.50 \u00c5, indicating significant face-to-face \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interaction [28] , which further stabilizes this 3D supramolecular system. Examination of this structure with PLATON [29] showed that there were no solvent-accessible voids in the crystal lattice of 1 . 3.2 Preparation, IR and TG analysis of compound 1 The structure determination of 1 indicates that during the hydrothermal reaction process, 4-(carboxylate)pyridinium was obtained from the hydrolysis of 2,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole. Similar case was also observed when Zn(NO 3 ) 2 was replaced by Cu(NO 3 ) 2 in the reaction course, and a known complex [Cu(L) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ]\u00b72H 2 O (L=isonicotinic acid) was obtained [30] . In the IR spectrum of the title complex 1 , the absorption bands resulting from the skeletal vibrations of the aromatic rings appear in the 1400\u20131600 cm \u22121 region. The broad band centered at ca. 3400 cm \u22121 indicates the O\u2013H stretching of the carboxylic group and/or coordinated/lattice water molecules. There are two sharp bands with medium intensity at ca. 3100 cm \u22121 , which are due to the N\u2013H stretching of the protonated pyridine ring. A very strong peak at 1647 cm \u22121 is attributed to the anti-symmetric stretching vibration, and the strong peak at 1345 cm \u22121 to the symmetric vibration of the carboxylic/carboxylate groups. Additionally, asymmetric and symmetric stretching of CH 2 - groups of H 2 EDTA occurs at about 2900 cm \u22121 [31] . Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were conducted to determine the thermal stability of complex 1 . The first weight loss of 8.58% from 80 to 170 \u00b0C (peak: 145 \u00b0C) corresponds to the loss of two lattice water molecules and one coordinated water molecule (calculated: 8.23%). The remaining substance does not lose weight upon further heating until two continuous weight loss occur in 190\u2013305 \u00b0C region (peaks: 248 and 265 \u00b0C), corresponding to the removal of two 4-(carboxylate)pyridinium guests (observed: 37.28%, calculated: 37.54%). Further heating to 800 \u00b0C of the sample indicates a continuous and slow weight loss. 4 Conclusion and comments In conclusion, the title supramolecular compound [Zn(H 2 EDTA)(H 2 O)](Q) 2 (H 2 O) 2 1 can be assembled by means of the hydrothermal synthesis of Zn II salt, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (H 4 EDTA) and 2,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole. The structure determination reveals that the guest 4-(carboxylate)pyridinium molecules, resulting from the ring-opening hydrolysis of 2,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole, expand the [Zn(H 2 EDTA)(H 2 O)](H 2 O) 2 subunits with 2D hydrogen-bonding layered motif to form a final 3D host\u2013guest supramolecular network through extensive hydrogen-bonding interactions, which is also stabilized by significant \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions between the pyridinium rings. It would provide interesting experimental data for supramolecular chemistry and crystal engineering. 5 Supplementary materials Crystallographic data for the crystal structure reported in this paper have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center (CCDC No. 235495).

Strong O-H...O hydrogen bonds connect the acid molecules to form a one-dimensional zigzag chain, around which the 4,4'-bpy components are fixed as arms via O-H...N interactions, resulting in a ladder motif. Through weak C-H...O non-covalent forces, the resulting acid layers are extended into a three-dimensional pillar-layered architecture supported by rod-like 4,4'-bpy components. The influence on hydrogen-bonding models is also discussed, with the discovery of an unexpected interaction motif that does not follow the routine hydrogen-bonded hierarchical rule in the construction of an acid-base co-crystal.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a systematic investigation on coordination chemistry of a pharmaceutical agent pamoic acid (H2PA), and also reveals the significant function of supramolecular interactions in managing the resultant crystalline networks with the incorporation of secondary co-ligands. Assemblies of pamoic acid with transition metal ions under similar conditions yield a series of eleven Mn II ,C u II ,Z n II , and Cd II complexes, in the absence/presence of the organonitrogen ligands such as 2,29-bipyridyl (2,29-bipy), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), and 4,49-bipyridyl (4,49-bipy). These compounds, together with the DMF solvate of pamoic acid, have been characterized by IR, elemental analysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction techniques. Generally, these complexes display similar 1-D pamoate-bridged coordination arrays (or 2-D coordination layers by introducing bridging 4,49-bipy). Remarkably, distinct extended network architectures are further constructed with the aid of weak secondary interactions especially aromatic stacking. Amongst them, complexes 6, 8, 9, and 12, which exhibit unusual interpenetrating networks of (6,3) layers or 3-D 5-connected frameworks regulated by stacking forces, are representative paradigms of this research. Structural evolution under the co-ligand intervention in this series of complexes, as well as the general coordination rule of pamoate, has been further discussed. Thermal stability of these crystalline materials and fluorescent properties of the polymeric Zn II and Cd II complexes have also been explored.",

X-Ray single-crystal structural determination reveals that the 3-D crystal packing of these complexes is mastered by the interplay of coordinative and secondary non-covalent interactions. The hierarchical regulated strategy in metal-organic supramolecular chemistry is successfully utilized in the rational construction of these architectures, which are, interestingly, influenced by the variation of the concerned assembled elements such as metal ion and solvent medium.

        "abstract": "In the presence of the organic template molecule, 4-amino-3,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole, a unique acentric coordination polymer based on linear 4,4\u2032-bipyridine (bipy) bridging ligand, {[Cu(bipy) 2.5 (H 2 O)](ClO 4 ) 2 \u00b7 (H 2 O) \u00b7 (CH 3 OH) 1.5 } n ( 1 ), was obtained by the reaction of Cu(II) perchlorate with bipy in H 2 O/CH 3 OH medium. The bidendate bipy molecules bridge the Cu II centers to form a 2-D bilayer framework with an 8 2 \u00b7 10 topology, and the monodendate bipy ligands, locating up and down each 2-D architecture, are involved in significant aromatic stacking interactions with the adjacent 2-D motifs, resulting in a 3-D porous network with large square channels for including the guest solvents and anions. Keywords Coordination polymer Porous material Aromatic stacking interactions Organic template Crystal structure The rapid expanding in crystal engineering of coordination polymers possessing polymeric metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) continues to produce various solid structures with novel compositions and topologies, along with potential applications as a new class of functional materials in host-guest chemistry, ion exchange, catalysis and for the development of optical, magnetic and electronic devices [1] . By appropriate choice of the bridging organic ligands (building blocks), such as the famous 4,4\u2032-bipyridine (bipy), and coordination preferences of the metal ions, robust materials can be designed and assembled to generate zeolite-like molecular-sized channels, cavities and pores of various sizes and shapes [2] . It is well known that the assembly processes in formation of such coordination frameworks are affected by many factors such as anions and solvents [3] . For Cu II -bipy polymer systems, two isostructural 1-D chain coordination patterns [Cu(bipy)(H 2 O) 2 X 2 ] \u00b7 (bipy), X = BF 4 - [4] or ClO 4 \u2212 [5] were reported, in which the uncoordinated bipy guest molecules are inserted in the cavities of the 2-D hydrogen-bonded layers formed by the inter-chain hydrogen bonds. Recently, we have reported an interesting 2-D grid-like Cu II -bipy coordination sheet, {[Cu(bipy) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ](ClO 4 ) 2 \u00b7 (H 2 O) 3 \u00b7 (bpo)} n exhibiting large square channels for the inclusion of the guest organic template 2,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (bpo) [6] . In order to further understand the influence of the guest molecules in formation of the Cu II -bipy coordination polymers, we select an angular dipyridyl compound 4-amino-3,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole [7] to extend this investigation, and an unexpected 2-D bilayer coordination polymer {[Cu(bipy) 2.5 (H 2 O)](ClO 4 ) 2 \u00b7 (H 2 O) \u00b7 (CH 3 OH) 1.5 } n ( 1 ) was obtained. Here we will report the structural analysis and interesting properties of this complex. To a solution of [Cu(H 2 O) 6 ](ClO 4 ) 2 (110 mg, 0.3 mmol) in H 2 O (20 ml) was slowly added a solution of bipy (80 mg, 0.5 mmol) in CH 3 OH (10 ml) with stirring for 30 min, then a solution of 4-amino-3,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole (120 mg, 0.5 mmol) in hot CH 3 OH (30 ml) was added. The resulting mixture was stirred for 30 min under refluxing. The blue solution was filtered and left to stand at room temperature. Blue block-shape single crystals of 1 suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained within two weeks by slow evaporation of the solvent in 40% yield based on the bipy ligand [8] . Although 4-amino-3,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole did not exist in the final product 1 , it clearly played a key role in formation of this 2-D bilayer framework, which is different to the reported 1-D [Cu(bipy)(H 2 O) 2 (ClO 4 ) 2 ] \u00b7 (bipy) complex [5] that could be obtained from the same preparation procedure of 1 except that 4-amino-3,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole is not involved in the starting material. Complex 1 is air stable and insoluble in common organic solvents and water, being consistent with its polymeric nature. In its IR spectrum, the broad band centered at ca. 3400 cm \u22121 accounts for O\u2013H stretching of the solvents and the skeletal vibrations of the aromatic rings occur in 1400\u20131600 cm \u22121 region. The split \u03bd Cl\u2013O stretches of the perchlorate ions at \u223c1100 cm \u22121 (another characteristic band is at 627 cm \u22121 ) provides good evidence of their involvement in the formation of hydrogen bonds. The TGA curve of polycrystalline sample 1 shows the first weight loss from 75 to 130 \u00b0C, corresponding to the removal of the H 2 O and CH 3 OH solvate molecules, and the loss of the coordinated aqua is not observed before 260 \u00b0C, beyond which the framework starts to collapse. The crystal structure determination of 1 [9] reveals that it is spontaneously resolved chiral crystal (each individual crystal is a single enantiomer), which is made up of a polymeric cationic [Cu(bipy) 2.5 (H 2 O)] 2+ framework containing large square channels that accommodate the ClO 4 \u2212 counter anions and solvate guest molecules. As shown in Fig. 1(a) , each Cu II center is in a slightly distorted square-planar geometry surrounded by four nitrogen donors from adjacent bipy ligands. The Cu\u2013N bond distances vary form 1.980(7) to 2.018(6) \u00c5, all being within the normal range observed for bipyridyl Cu II complexes [10] and the cis N\u2013Cu\u2013N angles around the metal center lie in 87.5(3)\u201392.7(3)\u00b0. Additionally, a weak coordination interaction between the Cu II center and the water O(9) is observed with the Cu\u2013O distance of 2.445(6) \u00c5. It is notable that two and half crystallographically independent bipy ligands exhibit different bidendate bridging and terminal monodendate coordination modes: type A ligands containing N(1)\u2013N(2) group [two pyridyl rings are twisted by 52.3\u00b0 with respect to each other] extend the Cu II centers to form two crystallographically related [Cu(bipy)] n linear chains in which the neighboring Cu\u22efCu distance is 11.00 \u00c5; type B ligands possessing C 2 symmetry [with N(5) donor and the twisting angle of the pyridyl groups being 39.2\u00b0], acting as the pillars, further link these chains to result in the final bilayer architecture with the adjacent Cu\u22efCu separation bridged by it of 11.06 \u00c5; type C bipy as a monodentate terminal ligand [two pyridyl rings are twisted by 29.1\u00b0] to binding to each Cu II center with N(3) donor [the shortest N(4)\u22efCu separation is 4.614 \u00c5]. Fig. 1 (b) illustrates a schematic topology of 1 and how two [Cu(bipy)] n chains are cross-hatched. These chains are cross-linked by type B spacers which form the bottom portion of the T-shape moiety and the overall network can therefore be described and classified as a 2-D bilayer motif with the topological symbol of 8 2 \u00b7 10. Among the multifarious building units of the coordination polymers, the T-shape module is an attractive case due to many fascinating patterns were designed based on it, including 1-D ladder [11] , 2-D brick wall [12] , 2-D bilayer [13] and 3-D framework [14] , amongst which the bilayer motif is rare and has not been found until recent years [13,15] . A significant difference between 1 and other [M 2 (bipy) 3 (NO 3 )] 4 (M = Co II , Ni II and Zn II ) molecular bilayer polymers [13] resides in its 1:2.5 molar ratio of M:bipy. Coordination framework based on bipy with such a composition is really rare and only one case of [Ni(bipy) 2.5 (H 2 O) 2 ] was reported so far [16] , exhibiting a 1-D railroad pattern. The change of the M:bipy molar ratio introduces a monodentate bipy (type C) terminal to each Cu II center, which locates up and down the 2-D bilayer architecture. Analysis of the crystal packing of 1 showed that the 2-D cationic bilayers are further \u201cconnected\u201d by \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions between these type C bipy molecules to form a 3-D open framework with large channels as shown in Fig. 2 . The distance between one edge of each pyridine ring and the neighboring inclined pyridyl plane is only 3.1 \u00c5, indicating significant edge-to-face aromatic stacking interaction, which is one of the important types of non-covalent intermolecular forces similar to hydrogen bonding, and has been recognized to play a key role in the stabilization and regulatory function of the supramolecular construction [17] . However, it should be noted that the nature and utilization of \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction, mainly for further prediction of the crystal packing, is still not well documented in contrast to the well-understood hydrogen-bonding interaction. Viewing along the crystallographic c direction, two types of large square channels (intra-bilayer A with the dimensions of ca. 8.5 \u00d7 8.5 \u00c5 2 and interlayer B with the dimensions of ca. 8.5 \u00d7 7.0 \u00c5 2 ) are observed. Computation of the channel space [18] revealed a value of 3912 \u00c5 3 , corresponding to 51.3% of the unit-cell volume. Allowing for the volume of the included anions and solvate molecules, there still remains 1063 \u00c5 3 (13.9%) of void space. After removal of the solvents, the empty space adds up to 2311 (30.3% of the unit cell). Additionally, the 3-D motif is further stabilized by O\u2013H\u22efO and C\u2013H\u22efO hydrogen bonding interactions between the host framework and the perchlorate anions/solvents in the channels. The structure of 1 contains large channels with included solvent molecules, indicating its porous nature. Kitagawa and coworkers [13a] have investigated the gas-adsorption function of the molecular bilayer materials [M 2 (bipy) 3 (NO 3 )] 4 (M = Co II , Ni II and Zn II ). Complex 1 is a chiral crystal (space group Aba2 with flack parameter of 0.03(3)) and the coordination framework of 1 has a higher thermal stable than such materials [13] , which may arise from the significant inter-layered aromatic stacking interactions in 1 . Thus, according to the structure and TGA results of 1 , we were intrigued by the possibility of generating a chiral microporous framework {[Cu(bipy) 2.5 (H 2 O)](ClO 4 ) 2 } n ( 1a ) by removing the guest molecules. XRPD pattern for this sample remains essentially identical to that of 1 , which clearly demonstrated that after removal of the included solvents, the porous chiral solid 1a was generated (the composition of this material was identified by elemental analysis and the loss weight of 1 ) that retain the framework integrity of the pristine solid 1 . Such a chiral material is quite rare and may have potential application [19] . In conclusion, a unique bilayer coordination polymer 1 with large channels and interesting porous properties has been prepared by means of direct self-assembly between Cu II and bipy building block in the presence of organic template molecule, and the results clearly suggest that the aromatic rings of bipy are potential interaction sites for inter-layered \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking, which can be utilized to advantage in crystal engineering. Of further importance, combing this contribution and previous reports, we can conclude that the directly [5,6] or indirectly (this work) templating effect of the organic molecule could significantly tune the topologies and properties of such Cu(ClO 4 ) 2 /bipy coordination frameworks (1-D chain, 2-D sheet and 2-D bilayer, respectively). This may provide a helpful strategy to construction of other new such materials, which is undergoing in our lab.

In 1, 10-connected [Co5(\u03bc3-OH)2(COO)8] clusters are extended by the \u03bc4-1,4-ndc(2-) and trans-bix ligands to construct a rare, self-penetrating ile framework that can interestingly be regarded as the cross-link of two interpenetrating 6-connected pcu networks. While for 2, [Co8(\u03bc3-OH)4(COO)12] clusters serve as the 8-connected nodes, which are bridged by the \u03bc4/\u03bc5-1,4-ndc(2-) and trans-btp ligands to afford the highest-connected uninodal self-penetrating (4(20).6(8)) network based on octacobalt clusters. A synthetic and structural comparison of 1 and 2 demonstrates that the features of auxiliary N-donor ligands play a key role in governing the in situ formed clusters and the final 3-D coordination frameworks. Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate that complex 1 shows an antiferromagnetic interaction between the adjacent Co(II) ions, whereas 2 displays the dominant antiferromagnetic exchanges in 300-50 K and a ferrimagnetic-like behavior at lower temperatures.",

Using L to react with Mn(ClO 4 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O yielded a mononuclear molecule, [Mn(L) 2 (H 2 O) 2 (CH 3 CN) 2 ](ClO 4 ) 2 (CH 3 CN) 2 ( 1 ) (triclinic, P \u22121, a =8.790(4) \u00c5, b =10.227(4) \u00c5, c =23.255(10) \u00c5, \u03b1 =89.371(8)\u00b0, \u03b2 =82.980(8)\u00b0, \u03b3 =88.621(8)\u00b0, Z =2), in which the hydrogen bonding and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 aromatic stacking interactions extend the complex molecules to result in a two-dimensional (2D) supramolecular network.

Keywords Crystal structures Hydrogen bond \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 Stacking interaction Coordination polymer Supramolecular network 1 Introduction Self-assembly processes involving metal ions and organic ligands have attracted ever-increasing attention in the area of supramolecular chemistry and crystal engineering from the viewpoints of the development of novel functional materials with desired properties [1\u20135] . One of the ultimate goals of supramolecular chemistry is to predictably control the network structure, and thus to further modify the physicochemical property of the target product. The selection of proper ligands as \u2018building blocks\u2019, such as the simple 4,4\u2032-bipyridyl-based ligands, is undoubtedly a key point in manipulating the network structures [6] , and other factors such as the selection of the metal ion, the counter-anion and solvent effect have also been systematically studied by chemists in the past decade [7] . A novel angular dipyridyl-donor ligand, 2,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (L) ( Chart 1 ), and its 3- N -donor analog 2,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (L\u2032), have been of our research interest [8\u201317] for their particular characteristics described as following. (a) These ligands can take versatile bonding modes, such as monodentate (using one pyridyl nitrogen donor), bidentate bridging (using two pyridyl nitrogen donors), and tridentate bridging (using two pyridyl and one oxadiazole nitrogen donors) coordination modes to construct diverse coordination frameworks. (b) The structural geometries of the ligands themselves are changeful. The dihedral angles between the oxadiazole ring and two pyridyl rings, as well as the angle between the center of the oxadiazole ring and two pyridyl nitrogen donors, are adaptable to meet the coordination requirements. (c) The aromatic groups in each ligand, including two pyridyl rings and the central oxadiazole system, usually show a tendency to completely or partly participate in intermolecular \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions, which may significantly affect the packing arrangements of the structures. As a continuation of our work, we describe the preparation and structural characterization of three new complexes based on 2,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (L), [Mn(L) 2 (H 2 O) 2 (CH 3 CN) 2 ](ClO 4 ) 2 (CH 3 CN) 2 ( 1 ), [Fe(L) 2 (NSC) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ] ( 2 ) and [Ag 2 (L) 2 ](BF 4 ) 2 (CH 3 OH) 0.5 (H 2 O) 0.5 ( 3 ), in the present contribution. The non-covalent intermolecular contacts, such as \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions and/or hydrogen bonds, are presented in these complexes, and their effects on the overall supramolecular architectures are discussed in detail. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and general methods With the exception of the bridging ligand 2,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (L), which was synthesized according to reported literature procedure [18] , all of the starting materials and solvents were obtained commercially and used as received. Fourier transform (FT)-IR spectra (KBr pellets) were taken on a FT-IR 170SX (Nicolet) spectrometer. Carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240C analyzer. 2.2 Synthesis of complexes 1 \u2013 3 [Mn(L) 2 (H 2 O) 2 (CH 3 CN) 2 ](ClO 4 ) 2 (CH 3 CN) 2 ( 1 ).

The data collections were performed with Mo K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb =0.71073 \u00c5) by \u03d6 scan mode in the range of 2.17< \u03b8 <25.03\u00b0 (for 1 ), 2.73< \u03b8 <25.02\u00b0 (for 2 ) and 2.70< \u03b8 <25.03\u00b0 (for 3 ) at 293(2) K. All data were corrected by semi-empirical method using sadabs program. The program saint [19] was used for integration of the diffraction profiles. All structures were solved by direct methods using shelxs program of the shelxtl -97 package and refined with shelxl [20] . Metal atoms in all complexes were located from the E -maps and other non-hydrogen atoms were located in successive difference Fourier syntheses. The final refinements were performed by full matrix least-squares methods with anisotropic thermal parameters for non-hydrogen atoms on F 2 . The hydrogen atoms of the ligand were placed in the calculated sites and included in the final refinement in the riding model approximation with displacement parameters derived from the parent atoms to which they were bonded. The ratios of minimum to maximum apparent transmission are 0.9069 (for 1 ), 0.9358 (for 2 ), and 0.8830 (for 3 ), respectively. Molecular graphics were drawn with the program package XP. Further crystallographic data and experimental details for structural analyses of complexes 1 \u2013 3 are summarized in Table 1 , and selected bond lengths and angles with their estimated standard deviations in Table 2 , respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and general characterization of complexes 1 \u2013 3 Ligand L is very soluble in common polar organic solvents (such as CH 2 Cl 2 , CHCl 3 , CH 3 OH and CH 3 CN etc.), so that crystallization of its complexes with inorganic metal salts occurs readily. As stated above, single crystals of complexes 1 and 2 were prepared by the reactions of corresponding metal salt and L in 1:2 molar ratio through slow evaporation of the solvent. Additionally, the final product for 2 was independent to the quantity of NH 4 SCN. Complex 3 was obtained as crystalline polymeric compound in CH 3 OH/CHCl 3 mixed solvent system by combination of L with AgBF 4 in 1:1 molar ratio through diffusion. Compounds 1 \u2013 3 are air stable and can retain their structural integrity at room temperature for a considerable length of time. The IR spectra of complexes 1 \u2013 3 show absorption bands resulting from the skeletal vibration of the aromatic rings in the 1400\u20131600 cm \u22121 region. A strong and broad band centered around 3455 (for 1 ) and 3355 (for 2 ) cm \u22121 can be assignable to the \u03bd O\u2013H stretch of the coordinated water molecules, and that around 3440 (for 3 ) to the \u03bd O\u2013H stretch of the lattice aqua or CH 3 OH solvents. The characteristic absorption band with medium intensity of CH 3 CN ( \u03bd CN ) in 1 appears at 2220 cm \u22121 . Additionally, the IR spectrum for 2 displays the very strong absorption band of the NCS \u2212 anions at 2077 cm \u22121 . 3.2 Description of the crystal structures of complexes 1 \u2013 3 [Mn(L) 2 (H 2 O) 2 (CH 3 CN) 2 ](ClO 4 ) 2 (CH 3 CN) 2 ( 1 ). Complex 1 consists of a discrete centrosymmetrical [Mn(L) 2 (H 2 O) 2 (CH 3 CN) 2 ] 2+ , two ClO 4 \u2212 anions, and two lattice CH 3 CN molecules. The crystal structure of the cationic mononuclear unit is depicted in Fig. 1a . The Mn II ion is located at a crystallographic inversion center, and six-coordinated to two aqua and two CH 3 CN molecules in the equatorial plane, as well as two L ligands in the axial positions. The coordination geometry of the metal center can be described as a slightly distorted octahedron with the cis N\u2013Mn\u2013N and N\u2013Mn\u2013O angles being in the range of 87.48(15)\u201392.52(15)\u00b0. The two pyridine rings within each ligand form the dihedral angles of 3.1 and 1.3\u00b0, respectively, with the central oxadiazole plane, and the dihedral angle of 2.5\u00b0 with each other. In addition, it should be noted that two similar, but crystallographically independent molecules were observed in this structure. They have similar mononuclear motifs with only slight difference in bond distances and angles ( Table 2 ). Herein the L ligand uses only one of the pyridyl nitrogen atoms to bind to the metal center. The other uncoordinated pyridyl nitrogen serves as the hydrogen-bonding acceptor of the coordinated aqua molecule of another mononuclear cation with the O\u22efN distance of 2.731 \u00c5 [21] . Such hydrogen bonds extend the mononuclear units to 1D chains with loop-like links ( Fig. 1b ). There also exist intra-chain aromatic stacking interaction between the coordinated pyridyl ring and the adjacent uncoordinated case in each loop, with the inter-planar separation of 3.415 \u00c5 (center-to-center separation=3.722 \u00c5) [22] . Furthermore, these 1D chains are stacked parallel to generate a 2D undulating sheet along ac plane through the inter-chain aromatic interaction between the oxadiazole ring and the coordinated pyridyl ring. The inter-planar and center-to-center separations here are 3.302 and 3.655 \u00c5, respectively. Therefore, in complex 1 , the hydrogen bond and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions play an influential role in expanding the mononuclear units to 2D layers, among which lie the disordered ClO 4 \u2212 anions and lattice CH 3 CN molecules. Using L to react with Cu(ClO 4 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O in a CH 3 OH/H 2 O medium (even if in CH 3 CN/H 2 O system just as the preparation procedure of 1 ), a two-fold interpenetrated diamondoid 3D framework was afforded [8] , whose extended structure contrasts greatly with that of 1 . This discrepancy suggests that the nature of the metal ions highly influences the structural topologies of such coordination frameworks. [Fe(L) 2 (NSC) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ] ( 2 ). The molecular structure of the neutral mononuclear compound 2 is depicted in Fig. 2a . The coordination environment of Fe II ion is similar to that of Mn II in 1 . Each metal center is in an elongated octahedral environment composed of two nitrogen atoms from two NSC \u2212 groups (Fe\u2013N NCS =2.139(3) \u00c5) and two aqua oxygen atoms (Fe\u2013O=2.208(2) \u00c5) in the equatorial plane, and two nitrogen atoms from two L ligands (Fe\u2013N py =2.353(2) \u00c5) in the axial positions. The cis N\u2013Fe\u2013N and N\u2013Fe\u2013O angles are in the range of 89.38(10)\u201390.62(10)\u00b0 as listed in Table 2 . The NSC \u2212 anions are coordinated to Fe II in a monodentate terminal mode with the angles of 166.2(3)\u00b0 for Fe(1)\u2013N(5)\u2013C(13) and 178.7(3)\u00b0 for N(5)\u2013C(13)\u2013S(1). Two pyridyl rings within each L molecule deviate by 3.3\u00b0 from co-planarity, and form the dihedral angles of 3.7 and 1.2\u00b0, respectively, with the central oxadiazole plane. In 2 , a pair of centrosymmetrically related L ligands coordinate to the Fe II center in monodentate fashion to form the basal mononuclear unit. The uncoordinated pyridine and oxadiazole rings participate in the hydrogen bonds with the coordinated aqua molecules, which bind the mononuclear molecules to form a 2D layer structure. The O(2)\u22efN(2) and O(2)\u22efN(4) separations are 2.901 and 2.795 \u00c5, respectively, and the corresponding O(2)\u2013H(1)\u22efN(2) and O(2)\u2013H(2)\u22efN(4) angles are 159.5 and 159.6\u00b0. Moreover, the pyridyl rings of the ligands are involved in the interlayer face-to-face aromatic stacking interactions with the closest separation of 3.452 \u00c5 (center-to-center distance=3.690 \u00c5), through which the 2D layers are stacked parallel along a direction to generate a 3D supramolecular structure ( Fig. 2b ). It is noteworthy that complex 2 is the first Fe II coordination compound based on the series of angular dipyridyl-donor ligands. We have prepared three analogous complexes, [M(L) 2 (NSC) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ] (M=Cd II , Mn II or Co II ), in the same synthetic method [10,11] . These results indicate such mononuclear structure is thermodynamically stable and independent to the variety of the metal ions. [Ag 2 (L) 2 ](BF 4 ) 2 (CH 3 OH) 0.5 (H 2 O) 0.5 ( 3 ). The structure of 3 consists of 1D cationic chains, BF 4 \u2212 anions, CH 3 OH and aqua molecules. There are two independent Ag I centers [Ag(1) and Ag(2)] bridged by the L ligand in the asymmetric unit ( Fig. 3a ) . Each Ag I center is in a linear coordination environment (N\u2013Ag(1)\u2013N=175.3(4), N\u2013Ag(2)\u2013N=171.8(4)\u00b0) and coordinates to two pyridyl N atoms (Ag(1)\u2013N: 2.127(9) and 2.151(9) \u00c5; Ag(2)\u2013N: 2.130(9) and 2.164(9) \u00c5) from distinct bridging ligands. The L ligand links two Ag I centers in bidentate bridging mode with two pyridyl N donors to form an infinite chain. Two L molecules around the metal center are different in structural geometry. Two pyridine rings within one L form the dihedral angles of 6.1 and 21.4\u00b0, respectively, with the oxadiazole plane, and the dihedral angle of 25.7\u00b0 with each other. The corresponding values for the other L molecule are 5.7, 8.2 and 13.6\u00b0, respectively. The angle between the central oxadiazole ring and two N donors of the 4-pyridyl rings in each L molecule is 138.8 or 139.7\u00b0, resulting in a sinusoidal chain motif. The separation of the ligand-bridging Ag\u22efAg contact is 13.936 \u00c5. Of further interest, these infinite chains are arranged in a parallel fashion and form an undulating layer ( Fig. 3b ). The neighboring chains are anti-parallel to each other with the nearest inter-chain Ag\u22efAg distance of 3.879 \u00c5. One of the two pyridyl rings around each Ag(1) or Ag(2) center is involved in the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interaction with one oxadiazole ring in the other anti-parallel chain (inter-planar separation=3.042/3.318 \u00c5, center-to-center separation=3.706/3.657 \u00c5). These aromatic interactions extend the 1D chains to result in a 2D supramolecular layer, which are further stacked in an offset fashion with ABAB sequence. The BF 4 \u2212 anions and solvent guest molecules are incorporated in the interlayer regions. Although it has been well known that hydrogen bonding interactions are usually effective in extending the dimensions of a supramolecular network, however, the organic ligands involved in the nucleation process use both coordination and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions to build up the supramolecular framework, is still not well documented. In the structures of complexes 1 \u2013 3 , the significant aromatic staking interactions do play a critical role in expanding the dimensionality of the frameworks. 4 Conclusion Three metal complexes 1 \u2013 3 have been prepared by means of self-assemblies of Mn II , Fe II , Ag I salts and 2,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (L), and structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction analyses. The resultant structures of these complexes are profoundly influenced by \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions and/or hydrogen bonds, which will provide interesting examples for supramolecular chemistry and crystal engineering. 5 Supplementary materials Crystallographic data for the crystal structures reported in this paper have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center (CCDC Nos. 228104/05/06).

The host framework of each CP comprises two interpenetrating lvt topological networks. Three types of 1D channels with different chirality (achirality and left-handed or right-handed helicity) are observed to hold the perchlorate guest anions. Interestingly, both CPs materials have the exclusive and irreversible anion-exchange behaviors for acetate (OAc-), which however, are unavailable to chloride (Cl-), fluoroborate (BF 4 -), or nitrate (NO3 -) anion.

        "abstract": "The crystallization of norfloxacin, an antibacterial fluoroquinolone compound, with different benzenedicarboxylic acids yields five novel pharmaceutical salts via molecular recognition. X-ray single-crystal diffraction analyses reveal that these pharmaceutical agents present uniform charge-assistant hydrogen-bonding networks, which are in 1:1 stoichiometry of norfloxacin and dicarboxylate therein (with the exception of that with terephthalate). Unsubstituted benzenedicarboxylates (phthalate in 1, isophthalate in 2, and terephthalate in 3, respectively) are likely to crystallize with norfloxacin without lattice solvents, while the substituted isophthalate moieties (2-aminoisophthalate in 4 and 5-aminoisophthalate in 5) tend to form supramolecular adducts with the inclusion of water. Aromatic stacking interactions are present in all these structures, occurring between the fluoroquinolone and carboxylate phenyl rings (in 1-4) as well as between the fluoroquinolone planes (in 5). Thermal stability and solubility of all crystalline binary adducts have been determined. The effect of carboxylate counterions, substituents, and hydration states on the solubility and dissolution profile of drug salts 1-5 are investigated in pure water and 0.1 M HCl. After the formation of salts, the solubility increases at near neutral pH in almost all cases (except 3), but the order is changed in acidic medium. Phthalic acid shows evidence of a good candidate to enhance the solubility of fluoroquinolone drugs for the solubility of 1 is approximately 39 times as large as that of norfloxacin in pure water and also larger than that of norfloxacin in acidic system. For the isophthalates series, 2 has very poor solubility in 0.1 M HCl (only 0.06 times as that of Nf), while amino substituted isophthalates result in the enhancement of the solubility. Remarkably, crystal packing analyses of these pharmaceutical salts allow a possible correlation between the H-bonding prototypes and the solubility to be established. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

All four complexes have been prepared under similar conditions and characterized by elemental analysis, IR, and powder X-ray diffraction techniques. Singlecrystal X-ray diffraction indicates that these complexes display the infinite 1-D and 2-D arrays for {[Ag(L242)(CF3COO)](CH3OH)} n (1) and {[Ag2(L242)(CF3COO) 2](CH3CN)0.75(H2O) 0.25}n (2) as well as discrete dinuclear and tetranuclear coordination patterns for [Cd(L244)I2]2 (3) and [Cd2(L244)2I4(DMF) 2]2(DMF)2 (4). In 1 and 3, extended supramolecular architectures are further constructed via aromatic stacking interactions. Structural difference for each pair of complexes can be properly assigned to the significant solvent effect on assembled reactions (CH 3OH-H2O vs. CHCl3-CH3CN for 1 and 2 as well as CH3OH-H2O vs. H2O-DMF for 3 and 4).

Keywords Disulfoxide Flexible ligand Copper(II) Cadmium(II) Coordination compound Metal organic dimer Hydrogen bond Chain structure Crystal structure 1 Introduction A particularly active field of chemical research in recent years has been the design of extended molecular system [1] . Advances in this general area have employed a range of synthetic strategies and the products have taken a variety of forms [2] . An important goal in this developing field has been the rationalization of the structures of supramolecular crystals based on the structures of their component molecules [3] . Strong, selective, and directional hydrogen bonding has been noted as a most powerful organizing force in molecular assembly, and the vast majority of publications and reviews have been devoted to the self-organization of organic molecules into multi-dimensional hydrogen-bonded architectures [4] . By contrast, relatively less is known about hydrogen-bonding control of self-assembly of coordination compounds [5] . In addition, most of these materials are formed with rigid ligands, such as 4,4\u2032-bipyridine and pyrazine [6] , which can assist the design of predictable networks, simultaneously it frequently limits their ability to accommodate ionic or non-ionic species. Studies on flexible ligands are still relatively rare [7] , and we are interested in coordination polymers containing flexible ligands such as disulfoxide, dithioether, and trithioether. We have used these flexible ligands to generate polymeric metal complexes, which possess unique lamellar square array [3\u20135] topological or pseudo-octahedral metal-organic frameworks, etc., and we have substantiated that the cavities of the coordination networks can be controlled by varying the chain length of the ligands [8] . As a continuation of our work to investigate the coordination chemistry of disulfoxide ligands and the architecture of their polymeric metal complexes, we synthesized a new flexible disulfoxide ligand 1,6-bis(benzylsulfinyl)hexane ( L ) which has a longer spacer than those previous reported. We expect that this ligand is more flexible and its metal complexes may display unprecedented structure. The ligand L was treated with Cu(NO 3 ) 2 and Cd(NO 3 ) 2 to produce neutral dimeric [Cu 2 ( L ) 3 (H 2 O) 2 (NO 3 ) 4 ] 2 and [Cd 2 ( L ) 3 (H 2 O) 2 (NO 3 ) 4 ] 3 ( Chart 1 ), self-assembled by hydrogen-bonding to form one-dimensional chain structure. Herein, we report the syntheses and crystal structures of the ligand and its two complexes. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and general methods All the reagents and solvents employed were commercially available and used without further purification. The C, H and N analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240C analyzer. FT-IR spectra (KBr pellets) were taken on a FT-IR 170SX (Nicolet) spectrometer and 1 H NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker AC-P 200 spectrometer using TMS as the internal standard and CDCl 3 as the solvent. 2.2 Syntheses of ligand The ligand was synthesized by a similar method according to the Ref. [9] . 2.2.1 1,6-Bis(benzylthio)hexane Potassium hydroxide (80%, 7.2 g, 0.1 mol) and benzyl mercaptan (12.4 g, 0.1 mol) were dissolved in anhydrous ethanol (75 mL) at 70\u00b0C, then 1,6-dibromohexane (12.2 g, 0.05 mol) was added to the above solution with stirring over 1 h. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtrated to remove KBr precipitate. Then the solvent was removed under reduced pressure from above filtrate. The crude product was dissolved in chloroform (100 mL) and washed with 5% potassium hydroxide solution and distilled water, then dried over MgSO 4 . The product was obtained after the solvent was evaporated. Yield: 92%. 2.2.2 1,6-Bis(benzylsulfiny)hexane To a vigorously stirred solution of 1,6-bis(benzylthio)-hexane (13.2 g, 0.04 mol) in benzene (50 mL) concentrated nitric acid (63%, 6 mL) was added dropwise. After stirring for 24 h on ice bath, 15% sodium hydrogen carbonate solution was added to the resulting mixture to adjust the pH value to ca. 7 and the solid product was filtered, and washed with distilled water, ethanol and ether. Yield: 60%. FT-IR (cm \u20131 ): 696 m, 761w, 1023 s, 1454 m. Anal. calcd for C 20 H 26 O 2 S 2 : C, 66.20; H, 2.78. Found: C, 66.28; H, 2.69%. 1 H NMR (300 MHz): \u03b4 1.394 (q, 4 H), 1.736 ( t , 4 H), 2.529 ( t , 4H), 3.975 ( q , 4H), 7.258\u20137.375 ( m , 10H). Colorless cubic crystals of 1 (mp: 181\u2013183\u00b0C) were obtained together with those of 2 or 3 as described below, and also can be separated by fractional crystallization from methanol and chloroform from rac isomer (mp: 158\u2013160\u00b0C). 2.3 Preparation of complexes [Cu 2 L 3 (H 2 O) 2 (NO 3 ) 4 ] 2 . Diethoxyethane (2.5 mL) was added to the CHCl 3 solution (5 mL) of L (219 mg, 0.75 mmol), and the mixture was stirred for ca. 20 min. Then Cu(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b73H 2 O (60 mg, 0.25 mmol) in anhydrous methanol (5 mL) was added to the above mixture and further stirred at 70\u201380\u00b0C for about 4 h. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtered, the clear green filtrate was allowed to stand at room temperature for ca. 1 week, and blue flaky crystals suitable for X-ray investigation were obtained. Yield: 25%. Anal. calcd for C 30 H 41 CuN 2 O 10 S 3 : C, 48.04; H, 5.51; N, 3.74. Found: C, 48.15; H, 5.44; N, 3.70%. FT-IR (cm \u20131 ): 506m, 620m, 688s, 765m, 990w, 1025s, 1437m, 1383s, 1461m, 1496w, 2860m, 2920m and 3062w. [Cd 2 L 3 (H 2 O) 2 (NO 3 ) 4 ] 3 . This complex was prepared using a similar procedure to that described for 2 but using Cd(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b74H 2 O instead of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b73H 2 O in 20% yield. Anal. calcd for C 30 H 41 CdN 2 O 10 S 3 : C, 45.10; H, 5.18; N, 3.51. Found: C, 45.21; H, 5.04; N, 3.48%. FT-IR (cm \u20131 ): 505m, 617m, 697s, 754m, 992w, 1026s, 1119s, 1245m, 1297m, 1324w, 1384s, 1460m, 1495w, 2855m, 2917m and 3061w. 2.4 Crystal structure determinations Single crystals of 1 , 2 and 3 suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis with dimensions of 0.30\u00d70.25\u00d70.20, 0.30\u00d70.25\u00d70.30 and 0.25\u00d70.40\u00d70.30 mm 3 , respectively, were selected and mounted on top of a glass fiber. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements of 1\u20133 were carried out at 293(2) K on a Bruker Smart 1000 CCD area detector equipped with a graphite-monochromator situated in the incident beam for data collection. The determinations of unit cell parameters and data collections were performed with Mo K \u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb =0.71073 \u00c5). Unit cell dimensions were obtained with least-squares refinements and all the structures were solved by the direct methods using SHELXS-97 program [10] . The final refinements for the three structures were done by full matrix least-squares methods with anisotropic thermal parameters for non-hydrogen atoms on F 2 [11] . The hydrogen atoms were added theoretically, and riding on the concerned atoms and refined with fixed thermal factors. Semi-empirical absorption correction was applied using the SADABS program [12] . Crystallographic data and the experimental details for structural analyses are summarized in Table 1 . Molecular drawings were produced by the SHELXTL-XP program [13] . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Syntheses and general characterizations The ligand was prepared by a similar method to our previous work [9] . When M(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b7nH 2 O ( M =Cu or Cd) was treated with the mixture ligand of meso and rac isomers, crystals of meso isomer of the ligand together with the crystals of 2 or 3 were isolated. The meso isomer of the ligand can also be separated from rac isomer by fractional crystallization in CH 3 OH/CHCl 3 . The complexes were prepared by the reaction of M(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b7nH 2 O with the ligand in CH 3 OH/CHCl 3 in the presence of diethoxyethane to dehydrate ( Scheme 1 ). Both complexes are soluble in DMF and DMSO, and slightly soluble in CH 3 OH and CH 3 CN, and almost insoluble in H 2 O and acetone. The IR spectrum of 1 shows a strong band at 1023 cm \u20131 assigned to \u03bd S=O . The spectra of complexes 2 or 3 have a \u03bd S=O band at 1025 or 1026 cm \u20131 approximately identical to that of the free ligand, and a \u03bd S=O band at 990 or 992 cm \u20131 shifted to the frequency lower than that for the free ligand. It indicates that the ligand does not behave as a complete bidentate ligand but does coordinate, at least partially, as a monodentate ligand [14] . The existence of nitrate anions in the complexes was confirmed by IR spectra. 3.2 Description of the crystal structures C 20 H 26 O 2 S 2 1 . The X-ray analysis of 1 , as shown in Fig. 1 , has revealed that it corresponds to the meso diastereomer having an R,S conformation. All atoms between two S atoms, benzyl methene carbon atom C(14) and phenyl carbon atom C(15) lie almost on one plane, which form distinct dihedral angles of 68.0(2) and 143.6(3)\u00b0 with two phenyl rings, respectively, and the dihedral angle between them is 76.3(4)\u00b0. Two S\ue605O groups lie on the opposite sides of that plane with the distance of 9.157(5) \u00c5 for two O donors and their pseudo-torsion angle (S\ue605O\u22efS\ue605O) is \u2013160.5(4)\u00b0. The torsion angles of O(2)\u2013S(1)\u2013C(7)\u2013C(6) and O(1)\u2013S(2)\u2013C(14)\u2013C(15) are \u201376.8(2) and \u201383.5(3)\u00b0, respectively. Bond lengths and angles of the sulfinyl groups in 1, with the average values of 1.475(5) \u00c5 for the S\ue605O bond distance and 107.1(8)\u00b0 for the O\u2013S\u2013C bond angle, are in agreement with the values reported for uncoordinated mono-sulfoxide (DMSO) (S\ue605O, 1.48(1) \u00c5 O\u2013S\u2013C, 106.7(1)\u00b0), but the average value of 104.4(6)\u00b0 for the C\u2013S\u2013C angle is larger than the reported value (96.4(2)\u00b0) [15] . [Cu 2 (L) 3 (H 2 O) 2 (NO 3 ) 4 ] 2 . An ORTEP view of 2 including the atomic numbering scheme is shown in Fig. 2a . The structure of 2 consists of a neutral [Cu 2 ( L ) 3 (H 2 O) 2 (NO 3 ) 4 ] dimer having an inversion center. Each Cu II ion is coordinated to two oxygen atoms from monodentate and bis-monodentate L molecules, two oxygen atoms of two nitrate ions and one water molecule, showing a distorted square pyramidal coordination geometry. The equatorial plane is built up by two oxygen atoms of two nitrates, one oxygen atom of water molecule and one oxygen atom of the ligand, and the apical site is occupied by another ligand oxygen atom. The two nitrate groups are almost coplanar. The Cu\u2013O(disulfoxide) distances are 1.975(5) in equatorial plane and 2.254(5) \u00c5 in axial position, respectively being similar to those of other Cu II complexes of disulfoxide [16] . The Cu\u2013O(water) distance is 2.000(5) \u00c5 in normal bond length range [17] , and the average bond length of Cu\u2013O(nitrate) is 1.979(6) \u00c5. [Cd 2 ( L ) 3 (H 2 O) 2 (NO 3 ) 4 ] 3 . The ORTEP structure of 3 with atom labeling is shown in Fig. 2b . The structure of 3 consists of a neutral [Cd 2 ( L ) 3 (H 2 O) 2 (NO 3 ) 4 ] molecule with inversion center. Each Cd II ion has hepta-coordinate geometry. Two oxygen atoms of the monodentate and bis-monodentate L molecules, four oxygen atoms of two bidentate nitrate ions and one water molecule surround each metal center to form a distorted pentagonal bipyramidal polyhedron. Two nitrate ions and a sulfoxide group are at the equatorial position, and an oxygen atom of water molecule and an oxygen atom of L at the apical position. The coordinated oxygen atoms at the equatorial position are almost coplanar, but the alignment of the apical oxygen atoms is somewhat deviated from 180\u00b0 [O(1)\u2013Cd(1)\u2013O(10), 178.3(2)\u00b0]. Two oxygen atoms of each nitrate ion coordinated to Cd II unequally with the average Cd\u2013O(nitrate) bond lengths of 2.365(3) and 2.503(5) \u00c5 in equatorial plane, and these are different from those of {[Cd 2 ( \u03bc -bet) 3 ](NO 3 ) 4 } which are almost equal for Cd\u2013O(nitrate) bond lengths but similar to {[Cd 2 ( \u03bc -3,3\u2032-pytz) 3 (NO 3 ) 4 ](EtOH)} [18] . The Cd\u2013O( L ) distance is 2.285(4) \u00c5 in the equatorial plane and 2.238(4) \u00c5 in the apical position, and the bond length of Cd\u2013O(water) is 2.269(4) \u00c5 which is shorter than other analogous apical position Cd\u2013O(water) bond length [19] . In the dimeric complexes 2 and 3 , the ligands take two kinds of coordination modes on the coordination donors. One reserved as a bridge to link two adjacent metal ions by its two distinct O donors to form a dimer with two metal ions separated by 11.085(5) and 10.260(7) \u00c5 for 2 and 3 , and the other two ligands coordinate to two metal ions, respectively by one oxygen donor. As shown in Fig. 3a and b , the neutral dimeric units in 2 and 3 are bridged alternately by the hydrogen bonds formed by metal-coordinated water molecules of one complex unit, and nitrate oxygen atoms and uncoordinated O donors of L in the other complex molecule. The O\u22efO( L ) and O\u22efO(nitrate) separations are 2.658(4) and 2.728(5) \u00c5 in 2 and 2.681(3) and 2.751(4) \u00c5 in 3, falling into the normal range of the O\u22efO separation for hydrogen bonding [20] . In complexes 2 and 3 , the bis-monodentate ligand has a symmetric center, and the quasi-torsion angle of O\u2013S\u22efS\u2013O is 180\u00b0, and the S\u2013O vectors are parallel to each other but pointing to opposite directions; however, the S\u2013O vectors of the monodentate ligand form 91.3 and 98.8\u00b0 angles, respectively. This may be due to the reason that one oxygen donor of the ligand coordinates to the metal center. The distances between two oxygen atoms in the bis-monodentate ligand are 10.048(3) and 9.457(3) \u00c5, respectively, and the distances in the monodentate ligand are 11.206(3) and 8.400(6) \u00c5 for 2 and 3 , respectively. To our knowledge 3 is the first structurally determined cadmium(II) complex with flexible sulfoxide ligand. In summary, (a) only the meso isomer complexes were obtained when the starting ligand is a mixture of the rac and meso forms; (b) the binding of the ligands to Cu II or Cd II ions is in two kinds of coordination modes, i.e., monodentate and bis-monodentate. It is rare that two kinds of coordination modes present simultaneously in a complex molecule with disulfoxide; (c) in the complexes, the chain structure is formed by hydrogen bonds. For free sulfoxide, the formation of hydrogen bonding is common phenomenon, but the chain structure of the metal complexes constructed by hydrogen bonds is less; (d) in both complexes, nitrate ions adopt different coordination modes, probably due to the result of a delicate balance between electronic and steric factors.

There are one and a half crystallographically independent dinuclear cations in the lattice,however,with quite similar structural parameters.Each Cu(\u2161) center is pentacoordinated(CuN_4O) to two chelating phen ligands and a carboxylate oxygen from adipate,displaying a slightly distorted square-pyramid geometry.The two phen ligands chelating to each Cu(\u2161) center arrange in almost perpendicular orientation to avoid the severe steric hindrance.The adjacent(Cu(\u2161)) ions are bridged by an adipate dianion to form a binuclear structure,and as expected,significant \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions between the phen ligands are observed between the dimeric units.",

Both complexes have been characterized by IR, microanalysis, powder X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis. Single crystal X-ray diffraction indicates that the L 2 ligands take the (\u03b7 3, \u03bc 2) and (\u03b7 4, \u03bc 3) binding modes in 1 and 2, respectively, which connect the Hg(II) centers to afford linear and ladder-like 1D arrays. Interestingly, complex 1 exhibits strong solid state fluorescent emission at room temperature due to the intraligand transitions, whereas complex 2 is non-fluorescent. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V.

As a result, six copper(I) ions are interconnected by six \u03bc 3 \u2013 L 2 bridges to afford a hexanuclear cluster, in which the octahedral Cu 6 core is stabilized by significant cuprophilic interactions.

Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that 1 is a 2D layered coordination polymer constructed from the linkage of [Zn3(\u03bc-Cl)2] trinuclear units by L4 spacers, 2 shows a 1D coordination pattern with [Cd2(\u03bc-Cl)2] dinuclear units and L4 spacers in pair, whereas 3 has a discrete dinuclear structure. The metal ions used in the assembled processes will dominate the final coordination motifs of these complexes, as also, their extended supramolecular architectures in virtue of various secondary interactions.

        "abstract": "A promising alternative strategy for designing mesoporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has been proposed, by modifying the symmetry rather than expanding the length of organic linkers. By means of this approach, a unique MOF material based on the target [Zn8(ad)4] (ad = adeninate) clusters and C3-symmetric organic linkers can be obtained, with trigonal microporous (ca., 0.8\u2005nm) and hexagonal mesoporous (ca., 3.0\u2005nm) 1D channels. Moreover, the resulting 446-MOF shows distinct reactivity to transition and lanthanide metal ions. Significantly, the transmetalation of Co(II) or Ni(II) on the Zn(II) centers in 446-MOF can enhance the sorption capacities of CO2 and CH4 (16-21%), whereas the impregnation of Eu(III) and Tb(III) in the channels of 446-MOF will result in adjustable light-emitting behaviors.",

A series of five Cu II and Mn II coordination complexes with L building blocks and different chelating/bridging co-ligands have been prepared, namely [Cu(L)(phen)] n (1), [Cu(L)(4bpy)(H 2O)] n (2), {[Cu 2(L) 2(\u03bc 3-OH)](H 2dabco) 0.5(H 2O)} n (3), {[Mn 2(L)(phen) 4](H 2O) 2(ClO 4) 2} 2 (4), and {[Mn 2(L)(2bpy) 4](2bpy) 0.5(ClO 4) 2} 2 (5) (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, 4bpy = 4,4\u2032-bipyridine, dabco = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2, 2]octane, 2bpy = 2,2\u2032-bipyridine), in which the ligand L is obtained by an in situ hydrolysis reaction of 5,6-dihydro-1,4-dithiin-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride in the presence of lithium hydroxide. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that these complexes display a variety of coordination motifs, from the discrete tetranuclear species (4 and 5) to infinite 1-D arrays (1 and 3) and 2-D \u2192 3-D polycatenated architecture (2), which are regulated by the multiple coordination modes of L. Furthermore, the introduction of auxiliary N-heterocyclic ligands plays a critical role in extending the dimensionality of these metallosupramolecular systems via coordination and/or secondary interactions such as hydrogen bonds and aromatic stacking. The magnetic properties and thermal stability of these complexes have also been investigated and discussed in detail.",

        "abstract": "Selective adsorption and separation of CO2 are of great importance for different target applications. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represent a promising class of porous materials for this purpose. Here we present a unique MOF material, [Cu(tba)2]n (tba = 4-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)benzoate), which shows high CO2 adsorption selectivity over CH4/H2/O2/Ar/N2 gases (with IAST selectivity of 41-68 at 273 K and 33-51 at 293 K). By using a critical point dryer, the CO2 molecules can be well sealed in the 1D channels of [Cu(tba)2]n to allow a single-crystal X-ray analysis, which reveals the presence of not only C(\u03b4+)-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O(\u03b4-) bonds between the host framework and CO2 but also quadrupole-quadrupole (CO2(\u03b4-)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7(\u03b4+)CO2) interactions between the CO2 molecules. Furthermore, [Cu(tba)2]n will suffer divergent kinetic and thermodynamic hydration processes to form its isostructural hydrate {[Cu(tba)2](H2O)}n and a mononuclear complex [Cu(tba)2(H2O)4] via single-crystal to single-crystal transformations.",

The crystal structure of 1 , determined by X-ray diffraction technique, reveals that two centrosymmetric Cu II centers are bridged by a pair of tetradentate anionic bpp ligands, adopting a square-pyramidal environment with the water ligand occupying the axial site. An interesting feature of this structure is the formation of a two-dimensional supramolecular network through O\u2013H\u22efO hydrogen bonds between the water moieties of the cationic [Cu 2 (bpp) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ] 2+ subunits and perchlorate anions. The magnetic properties of 1 have been investigated by variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility and EPR measurements. Very strong antiferromagnetic interaction between the Cu II centers (with H =\u2212 JS 1 S 2 , J =\u2212368.3 cm \u22121 ) has been observed, and the magneto-structural correlations was analyzed.",

As confirmed by time-lapse optical microscopy, the latter two cases can be properly ascribed as partial recrystallization processes, while the former one is a continuous process with two different crystal lattices simultaneously maintained in one single crystal. Interestingly, these three distinct pathways can be exquisitely realized by changing only the halogen substituent (from -F, -Cl, to -Br) of the organic ligands in the coordination supramolecular systems.",

        "abstract": "Thus far, reports about the transformations for dynamic crystals of coordination supramolecular systems mainly include single-crystal-to-single-crystal reaction and solvent-mediated process. This Concept focuses on the mechanisms for solvent-mediated structural transformations of dynamic crystals, which can be classified into two categories, i.e. core-on-shell and core-to-core. The core-on-shell mechanism means that, the core of new crystal is generated from the shell of original crystal, being concomitant with the dissolution of mother crystal. While for the core-to-core case, the growth of new crystal core and the dissolution of original crystal core will simultaneously proceed, but are physically separated. Herein, the two mechanisms are elucidated in details, with some typical examples from recent advances.",

Interestingly, when the crystals of 1 were immersed in a water solution of BF4\u2013 or ClO4\u2013 anion, 2 or 3 can be irreversibly formed via anion-driven structural transformation. This process has also been investigated by means of PXRD, elemental analysis, FT-IR, and SEM-EDS, revealing a solvent-mediated mechanism. Moreover, the dynamic anion-exchange behavior is highly anion-selective but cation-independent.",

Significantly, 1 also represents a unique example to probe NFZ or NFT by using transition metal MOFs in water, which exhibits the most sensitive sensing ability for NFZ (Ksv = 5.2 \u00d7 104 M\u20131) and NFT (Ksv = 1.8 \u00d7 105 M\u20131) via luminescent quenching.",

Carbon capture and sequestration has been implemented as one of the most appealing pathways to control and use CO2. Here, we rationally integrate various functional sites within the confined nano-space of a microporous metal-organic framework (MOF) material, which is constructed by mixed-ligand strategy based on metal-adeninate vertices. It not only exhibits excellent stability but also can efficiently transform CO2 and epoxides to cyclic carbonates under mild and co-catalyst free conditions. Additionally, this catalyst shows extraordinary recyclability for the CO2 cycloaddition reaction.",

To the best of our knowledge, among the few documented triazole-cadmium coordination polymers, this complex presents a novel configuration. The deprotonated 1,2,4-triazole is in tridentate and succinate in bis-chelate modes to link the Cd(II) centers, generating a 2-D grid-like network topology. Ther- mogravimetric analysis results show that the framework architecture is a stable porous material. The fluorescent emission has also been discussed.",

        "abstract": "As a modulatable class of porous crystalline materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have gained intensive research attention in the domain of gas storage and separation. In this study, we report on the synthesis and gas adsorption properties of two robust MOFs with the general formula [Co(\u03bc-OH)(cpt)Co(\u03bc-OH)(L)(HO)](NO)(guests) [L = 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (1) and 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole (2); Hcpt = 4-(4-carboxyphenyl)-1,2,4-triazole], which show the same pacs topology. Both MOFs are isostructural to each other and show MIL-88-type frameworks whose pore spaces are partitioned by different functionlized trinuclear 1,2,4-triazolate-based clusters. The similar framework components with different amounts of functional groups make them an ideal platform to permit a systematic gas sorption/separation study to evaluate the effects of distinctive parameters on the CH uptake and separation performance. Because of the presence of additional amido groups, the MOF 2 equipped with a datz-based cluster (Hdatz = 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole) shows a much improved CH uptake capacity and separation performance over that of the MOF 1 equipped with atz-based clusters (Hatz = 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole), although the surface area of the MOF 1 is almost twice than that of the MOF 2. Moreover, the high density of open metal sites, abundant free amido groups, and charged framework give the MOF 2 an excellent CH separation performance, with ideal adsorbed solution theory selectivity values reaching up to 11.5 and 13 for CH/CH (1:99) and CH/CO (50:50) at 298 K and 1 bar, showing potential for use in natural gas purification.",

Significantly, this reaction represents the first example of using diyne as a one-carbon reaction partner in C-H functionalization. Kinetic isotope effects suggested that the catalytic cycle of this reaction is initiated by the cleavage of the ortho C-H bond in the N-phenyl ring of amidines, which is likely involved in the rate-limiting step. Calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) indicated that C-H activation and the formation of Rh(V) species via 5-exo-cyclization could be vital processes for this cascade transformation.",

Herein, a new two-dimensional (2D) Cu(I)-based MOF material showing a narrow forbidden-band of 2.13 eV was successfully constructed using a visible-light-harvesting anthracene-based bipyridine ligand. The as-prepared MOF demonstrates high chemical stability and could be stable in the pH range 2-13, which is favorable for its potential application in photocatalysis. Photocatalytic experiments demonstrate that this Cu(I)-MOF exhibits high reactivity for reduction of Cr(VI) in water, with 95% Cr(VI) converting to Cr(III) in 10 min by using MeOH as scavenger under visible-light illumination. Furthermore, this MOF could behave as a highly active photocatalyst for H evolution without additional photosensitizers and cocatalyst. Remarkably, the as-prepared MOF shows enhanced photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction and H evolution performances compared with the pristine light-harvesting ligand under the same conditions. In connection to these, the photocatalytic reaction mechanism has also been probed.",

This MOF exhibits interesting structural dynamic upon CO2 sorption at 195 K and high CO2/N2 (127) and CO2/CH4 (131) sorption selectivity at 298 K and 1 bar. Particularly, its CO2/CH4 selectivity is among the highest MOFs for selective CO2 separation. The results of Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation indicate that the polar framework contributes to the strong framework-CO2 binding at zero loading, and the tetrazole pillar contributes to the high CO2 uptake capacity at high loading. Furthermore, the solvent-responsive luminescent properties of 1 indicate that it could be utilized as a fluorescent sensor to detect trace amounts of nitrobenzene in both solvent and vapor systems.

Among these immunosensors, 516-MOF showed a preferable biosensing ability toward analytes determined by electrochemical techniques. The developed 516-MOF-based electrochemical biosensor not only demonstrated high sensitivity with low detection limits of 0.70 and 0.40pgmL toward vomitoxin and salbutamol, respectively, but also showed good selectivity in the presence of other interferences.

The cationic 3D framework contains microporous channels with accessible Lewis-base sites and NO3- ions as balanced anions, which all contribute to the selective detection of multifarious analytes. This MOF shows ratiometric detection of acetone, Cr2O72- ions, and nitroaromatic compounds (NACs). In particular, it shows great recognition of four NACs in water, representing the first LnIII-MOF which can display distinguishing fluorescence phenomena on NACs rather than relying on the quenching effect. Furthermore, this is also the first example of a MOF-sensor for detecting these explosives discriminatively by ratiometric methods. Additionally, the mechanisms for luminescent responses towards different analytes have been discussed in detail.",

        "abstract": "Metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs), as a class of adjustable porous crystalline materials, have received considerable attention in recent years. In this study, starting from an unstable MIL-88 type Co(II)-MOF as the prototype structure, two isoreticular stabilized MOFs with similar structural features but different water/thermal stabilities and acetylene sorption behaviors were prepared, which can be modulated by incorporating different functional brackets in the pores. MOF 1 equipped with open metal sites (OMSs) decomposed quickly in water solution, while the free N-donor functionalized MOF 2 could be stable in water with improved thermostability. The gas sorption study reveals that activated material 2 has a significantly enhanced acetylene uptake capacity with a lower Qst value than those of activated 1, showing a 79% increase (242 vs. 135 cm3 g\u22121) at 273 K and 91% increase (165 vs. 86 cm3 g\u22121) at 298 K. The acetylene uptake capacity of activated material 2 is extraordinarily high among MOFs without OMSs, and is even comparable to some famous MOFs with much stronger C2H2 binding ability which however require considerably higher energy for regeneration. The experimental results were further confirmed by the molecular mechanics (MM) calculations, grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) studies.",

In the structure of the Tb-MOF, there co-exist single-stranded and double-stranded helical chains along the c axis, and the overall network shows a three-fold interpenetrated qtz net. This MOF is capable of selectively sensing Fe3+ and Al3+ ions in water via quenching the luminescence and tuning the emission ratio between the ligand-based and metal-based luminescence, respectively. More importantly, this MOF can realize fast detection for p-xylene (PX) vapor with a response time of less than 10 s and 40% fluorescence enhancement, while nitrobenzene (NB) vapor could lead to a quenching effect in 10 min with a 75% quenching efficiency. Remarkably, this is the first example of a multi-responsive luminescent Tb-MOF sensor for Fe3+ and Al3+ ions and VOC vapor detection. In connection to these, the probable sensing mechanisms were also discussed in this paper.",

In this work, a bimetallic metal-organic framework (MOF), namely {(Me 2 NH 2 )[Tb 0.9 Eu 0.1 (OBA) 2 ]\u2219(Hatz)\u2219(H 2 O) 1.5 } n  ( 1 , H 2 OBA\u202f=\u202f4,4\u2032-oxybis(benzoate) acid, Hatz\u202f=\u202f3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) with a yellow-emission signal has been successfully fabricated by appealing to the lanthanide doping strategy. In this MOF, the emission band of OBA 2\u2212  ligand matches well with the excitation energy of lanthanide ions (Eu 3+  and Tb 3+ ) which leads to high energy transfer from the ligand to the lanthanide ions to provide dual emission peaks for the both Eu 3+  and Tb 3+  ions. This MOF shows high fluorescence stability with the ratio of its two emission peaks (545\u202fnm and 618\u202fnm) do not change with the change of Ln-MOF sensor concentration used as the merit of ratiometric fluorescence detection. Subsequently, we choose this MOF as a fluorescent sensor for various volatile organic molecules, and the results show that it is capable of decoding methanol with an obvious color change and unique emission intensity ratio of Tb 3+  ion to Eu 3+  ion, both in the solution and vapor state. Good detection reproducibility and fast response could be achieved in this sensor.",

The advantages of chemical functionality, strong bioaffinity, and high stability of the Fe3O4@mC can be combined with the high specific surface area of 525-MOF leading to the formation of Fe3O4@mC nanocomposites as a scaffold for oxytetracycline (OTC) aptamer strands. The use of Fe3O4@mC nanocomposites reveals high OTC detection efficiency. The nanocomposite calcined at 900 \u00b0C (denoted as Fe3O4@mC900) is found to be the best candidate toward high-sensitivity and high-selectivity detection of OTC because of its excellent functionality, nanostructural properties, and high electrochemical performance. Accordingly, the Fe3O4@mC900-based electrochemical aptasensor displays high sensitivity with a low detection limit of 0.027 pg mL\u22121 within a broad linear range of OTC concentration from 0.005 to 1.0 ng mL\u22121. The aptasensor also exhibits high selectivity, reproducibility, stability, regenerability, and applicability in milk samples. All of these results indicate that the Fe3O4@mC nanocomposites that originated from 525-MOF can be applied in the fields of trace and fast antibiotic determination.",

ZZULI-1 exhibits highly efficient photocatalytic H evolution (6614 \u03bcmol g h) and O evolution (1032 \u03bcmol g calculated for the first 6 min). The {Cu(\u03bc-Cl)(\u03bc-Cl)} clusters and mixed POMs not only work as the active units for H and O production, respectively, but also improve the effective electron transfer between the photosensitizer and ZZULI-1.

It can serve as a recyclable multi-responsive sensing material for detecting Fe3+, MnO4\u2212, Cr2O72\u2212, and p-nitrotoluene (4-NT). Significantly, this is the first reported MOF-based sensor for detecting explosive 4-NT. Moreover, the mechanism of the selective luminescence quenching response for Fe3+, MnO4\u2212, Cr2O72\u2212 or 4-NT can be mainly explained in terms of the competition between the absorption of the light source energy and the electronic interaction between the analyte and the TBOT ligand.",

As the first example without additional cocatalysts and photosensitizers, the comparatively cost-effective Cu2I2-based MOF Cu-I-bpy, exhibited a high-efficiently photocatalytic hydrogen production (7.09 mmol\u00b7g-1\u00b7h-1). DFT calculations established the electronic structures of Cu-I-bpy with a narrow band gap of 2.05 eV, indicating its semi-conductive behavior, which was well consistent with the experimental value of 2.00 eV. The proposed mechanism demonstrates that Cu2I2 clusters of Cu-I-bpy serve as photoelectron generators to accelerate the copper(I) hydrides interaction, providing redox reaction sites for hydrogen evolution. The highly stable cocatalyst-free and self-sensitized Cu-I-bpy provides new insights into the design of cost-effective d10-based MOFs for high-efficient and long-term solar fuels production in future.",

        "abstract": "We designed and synthesized a novel covalent organic framework (COF) by condensation polymerization of 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(4-formylphenyl)pyrene and melamine through imine bonds (represented by Py-M-COF). The basic characterizations revealed that the Py-M-COF not only exhibited an extended \u03c0-conjugation framework, a large specific surface area (495.5\u202fm g), big pore cavities, and nanosheet-like structure but also possessed rich functional groups, such as C\u02edC, C\u02edN, C\u02edO, and NH. These features endowed the Py-M-COF with high charge carrier mobility, further improving the strong immobilization of DNA aptamer strands via \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction and electrostatic interaction. As such, the Py-M-COF-based electrochemical aptasensors are ultrasensitive in detecting different antibiotics, including enrofloxacin (ENR) and ampicillin (AMP), yielding extremely low detection limits of 6.07 and 0.04\u202ffg\u202fmL (S/N\u202f=\u202f3) toward ENR and AMP, respectively, along with other excellent sensing performances. This biosensing platform based on Py-M-COF has potential applications for the sensitive detection of antibiotics or other analytes by replacing the corresponding aptamers.",

The CDs@ZrHf-MOF can be applied as the scaffold for anchoring aptamer strands to determine human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) and living HER2-overexpressed MCF-7 cells. The basic characterizations reveal that the CDs are embedded within the interior cavities of ZrHf-MOF without varying the nanostructure, leading to good biocompatibility, strong fluorescence, and high electrochemical activity of CDs@ZrHf-MOF. As compared with the pristine ZrHf-MOF, the CDs@ZrHf-MOF-based electrochemical aptasensor displays better sensing performances toward both HER-2 and MCF-7 cells, giving an extremely low detection limit of 19\u202ffg\u202fmL (HER2 concentration range: 0.001-10\u202fng\u202fmL) and 23 cell\u202fmL (cell concentration range: 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10~1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 cell\u202fmL), with good selectivity, stability, reproducibility, and acceptable applicability.

It is shown to be a viable material for the impedimetric aptamer-based determination of ochratoxin A (OTA). Basic characterizations revealed that the chemical composition and crystal structure of AuNP@CuCoPBA is similar to that of pristine CuCo PBA. Nevertheless, the nanocube shape of CoCu PBA is converted to small nanoparticles on addition of AuNPs. Compared with CuCoPBA-based aptasensor, the AuNP@CuCoPBA-based assay exhibits excellent electrochemical conductivity, strong aptamer binding interaction, and high G-quadruplex stability. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that the assay has limits of detection as low as 5.2\u00a0fg\u00a0mL of OTA, a response in the 50\u00a0fg\u00a0mL to 10\u00a0ng\u00a0mL concentration range, high selectivity, good reproducibility, repeatability, and acceptable applicability. In our perception, it represents a universal and powerful method for aptamer strand immobilization. It may be applied to the determination of various other analytes for which aptamers are available. Graphical abstract Schematic presentation of the preparation of a novel bimetallic Cu-Co PBAs coupling with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was supplied. The AuNP@CuCoPBA composite was applied for the sensitive detection of ochratoxin A (OTA).

        "abstract": "Abstract   An advanced trifunctional electrocatalyst based on a series of composites composed of TiO 2 -encapsulated carbon-nitride (CN x ) (denoted as TiO 2 C@CN x ) is developed, which is derived from the Ti 3 C 2 T x  and melamine\u2013cyanuric acid calcinated at different temperatures. Among the series of TiO 2 C@CN x  nanosheets, the TiO 2 C@CN x,950  (obtained by calcination at 950\u2009\u00b0C) hybrid exhibits robust trifunctional electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by combining the excellent electrochemical activity of the graphene-like nanostructure and the high electrocatalytic performances of TiO 2  nanoparticles. When TiO 2 C@CN x,950  is used as the electrocatalyst for water splitting, a current density of 10\u2009mA cm \u22122  ( E j  \u2009=\u200910) is achieved at a low cell voltage of 1.50\u2009V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. Meanwhile, the overall oxygen activity of the TiO 2 C@CN x,950  exhibits good reversible oxygen reaction, giving a small potential difference between the  E j  \u2009=\u200910 for OER and the half-wave potential for ORR (0.75\u2009V). Moreover, a simply equipped Zn-air battery is assembled using a homemade cathode, showing open-circuit potential of 1.344\u2009V, which also can supplied an electrical power and produced H 2  at the cathode and O 2  at the anode. Consequently, this work can pave a path for developing multifunctional electrocatalysts for water spitting and liquid Zn\u2013air battery.",

        "abstract": "Combining different metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) into a conjugate material can integrate the properties of each MOF component and further lead to emergent properties from the synergistic heterostructured units. In this work, two kinds of bimetallic TbFe-MOFs have been designed by MOF-on-MOF strategy and utilized as a platform for anchoring carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) aptamer to detect CA125 and living michigan cancer foundation-7 (MCF-7) cells. Although the integrated MOF-on-MOF architectures show similar chemical and structural features to that of the top layer, the Fe-MOF-on-Tb-MOF and Tb-MOF-on-Fe-MOF have different surface nanostructures to their parent MOFs. The developed aptasensor based on Tb-MOF-on-Fe-MOF displays higher stability of the formed G-quadruplex between aptamer and CA125 than that based on Fe-MOF-on-Tb-MOF, owing to stronger immobilization behavior of the aptamer for the Tb-MOF-on-Fe-MOF composite. The developed aptasensor provides an extremely low detection limit of 58 \u03bcU\u00b7mL towards CA125 within a wide linear range from 100 \u03bcU\u00b7mL to 200 U\u00b7mL, which is significantly lower than those of all reported sensors. This aptasensor also has high selectivity, good stability, acceptable reproducibility, and excellent applicability in human serum. Moreover, the Tb-MOF-on-Fe-MOF nanoarchitecture demonstrates superior biocompatibility and good endocytosis. As a result, the developed aptasensor illustrates high sensitivity for detection of MCF-7\u202fcells with an extremely low detection limit of 19\u202fcell\u00b7mL. Therefore, the proposed aptasensor based on Tb-MOF-on-Fe-MOF exhibits great potentials for early diagnosis of tumors.",

This work develops a composite strategy to skillfully load MOFs on a polymer plate to afford processability for these powder materials. A predesigned mesoporous MOF with active -NH groups around the pore walls was prepared and its copolymerization with the -NCO groups of macromonomers (polyurethane acrylate) could be facilely induced by an initiator under mild conditions. Notably, the target MOF-polymer composite is transparent, elastic, and shows enhanced Fe detection compared with that of the individual MOF functional component. This result can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of the composite with newly formed chemical bonds between the MOF particle and polymer matrix.",

Using co-injection in\n cytoplasm, two independent gene constructs, including bovine \u03b1-s1-casein-hG-CSF and a mammal expression vector expressing a nuclear localization signal (mNLS), were introduced into fertilized mouse eggs.\n The target gene construct was docked into host nucleus probably by the nuclear localization signal. Transgene mice have been\n obtained at 58% (29/50) of integration ratio. Expression level of the positive transgene mice was detected by Western blotting.\n Maximal expression of human G-CSF was estimated about 540 mg/L of milk. The expression ratio was up to 75% (9/12). The results\n here have important practical implications for the generation of mammary gland bioreactors and other transgene studies. Co-injection\n of a target gene with an expression vector of a mammal nuclear localization signal by cytoplasm appears to be a useful, efficient\n and easy strategy for generating transgenic animals, which may be able to substitute the routine method of pronucleus-injection\n of fertilized eggs.",

        "abstract": "The neomycin-resistant gene (neo(r)) is probably the most commonly used selectable marker gene in gene targeting and gene transfection research. In this study, the neo(r) gene construct was introduced into in vitro cultured goat foetal fibroblast cells (IV-5), and the cells were selected with 900 microg/ml G418. The G418-resistant colonies were analysed by neo-specific PCR, karyotyping and anti-intermediate filament proteins antibody (anti-vimentin) staining. Cell cycle analysis of the neo(r) positive foetal fibroblast cell colony (IV-5.1) cultured in a variety of cell cycle-arresting medium indicated that 74.2% of cells cultured in serum-deprived medium for 3 days and 71.7% of cells grown to confluence were at G0/G1 stage of cell cycle, respectively, in comparison to 61.6% of cells in normal culture (cycling) medium. Nocodazole treatment for 17 hr in vitro culture could increase the number of cells at G2/M stage of cell cycle from 20.3% (in cycling medium) to 39.7%. In total, one early pregnancy was observed by B ultra-sound scanning in a surrogate transferred with cloned embryos from IV-5.1 cells at M stage (cells were cultured in nocodazole medium). Seven cloned goats, including two that miscarried at a late stage, were derived from the IV-5.1 cell clone cultured in starved medium (G0). Indeed, one surrogate receiving three blastocysts reconstituted from the starved donor cells, gave birth to three live cloned goats, all of which are healthy and doing well. PCR, Southern blot and G418 resistance in vitro of fibroblast cells from cloned goats confirmed that all cloned goats are positive for neo(r) transgene. This study demonstrates that a foreign gene, such as the neo-resistant gene, can be introduced into goat foetal fibroblast cells, and that the resulting transgenic cells are capable of being cloned to produce 100% transgenic animals.",

        "abstract": "Multiple-transgene co-integration offers a powerful means by which several transgenes can be co-expressed in mammary glands. Independent gene constructs, including bovine a-casein-hG-CSF, mWAP-hEPO, and CMV-EGFP, were co-injected into fertilized mouse eggs whereupon 32% (17/54) of the transgenic mice showed integration of all the three constructs. The co-expression ratio of hG-CSF and hEPO proteins in the mouse milk was up to 54% (6/11), attributable to co-integration. Maximal expression of human EPO and G-CSF was about 1 mg l-1 and 540 mg l-1 milk, respectively. There was an inverse relationship between transgene fragment length and integration ratio, and evidence that co-integration events are favoured above single integration events, suggesting that integration of multiple genes may be more facilitated than a single gene. The results have important practical implications for the generation of mammary gland bioreactors, multiple transgene co-integration appearing to be a useful strategy for generating animals expressing several transgenes simultaneously.",

Enucleated oocytes were either injected with cumulus cell nuclei without piezo-driven manipulator (injection method) or fused with cumulus cells (fusion method). The survival rate of cloned embryos, obtained by injection, was higher than that derived from fusion (62.7 and 45.9%, respectively). Two cloned goats were derived by fusion with in vitro cultured cumulus cells without starvation, but died shortly after natural birth, from respiratory difficulties. Their birth weights (2.23 kg and 2.03 kg) were within the normal range (2.0-2.7 kg) and postmortem analysis revealed no morphological abnormalities. The third cloned goat, derived by injection of nuclei from freshly isolated cumulus cells, weighed 3.3 kg at birth, and was 37% overweight compared with the average weight of the same species. This goat is healthy and well as this paper is being prepared. Nested PCR-RFLP analysis confirmed that all the cloned goats were derived from the donor cells.",

In this study, expressions of growth-related genes including three imprinting genes (H19, IGF2, and IGF2R) and four non-imprinting genes (IGF1, IGF1R, GHR, and GHSR) in adult nuclear transferred (NT) goats were investigated by real-time PCR. The expressions of these genes in adult clones were found largely normal, but IGF2R and IGF1R were more highly expressed in cloned goats than in non-NT goats (P < 0.01). Analysis on mono-allelic expression pattern of imprinting genes indicated that mono-allelic expression patterns of H19 and IGF2 in cloned goats were similar to that in non-NT goats. In addition, the sequence of goat IGF2 gene and the putative amino acid sequence were obtained. The 986 nucleotide cDNA of goat IGF2 gene contained an open-reading frame of 540 nucleotides coding for 179 amino acids. Both cDNA sequence and amino acid sequence of IGF2 in goat showed their higher homology with that in sheep than in cattle; the partial cDNA fragments of H19, IGF2R, GHSR, IGF1R, and GHR in goat were also cloned and sequenced, which shared higher sequence identities with those in sheep than in cattle.",

The influence of surface-treatment of mica particles on dynamic rheological behavior of the composites were dealt with. The viscosity (\u03b7) and dynamic modulus (G\u2032) of the composite melts were higher than those of PP matrix, especially those for systems treated with silane, which was attributed to the interfacial adhesion enhancement. However, surface-treatment of mica by titanate resulted in lower \u03b7 and G\u2032, as compared with the treatment by silane. The reason for this is believed to be the formation of the mono-molecular layer on the mica surface.",

        "abstract": "The viscoelastic relaxation of linear styrene-butadiene-styrene triblock copolymer (l-SBS) and star styrene-butadiene-styrene triblock copolymer (s-SBS) with four arms were investigated with differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic rheological measurements. Three characteristic viscoelastic responses of l-SBS and s-SBS in the plot of the loss tangent (tan \u00ce) and temperature at different frequencies (\u00cf's), which corresponded to the relaxation of the polybutadiene (PB) block (peak I), the glass transition of the polystyrene (PS) phase (peak II), and the mutual diffusion between the PB blocks and PS blocks (peak III), respectively, were observed in the experimental range. Although \u00cf was 0.1 rad/s, a noticeable peak III was gained for both l-SBS and s-SBS. The dynamic storage modulus (Ga\u2032) of l-SBS showed two distinct types of behavior, depending on the temperature. At temperature (T) < T2 (where T2 is the temperature corresponding to peak II), Ga\u2032 of l-SBS displayed a very weak \u00cf dependency. In contrast, at T > T 2, Ga\u2032 decayed much more rapidly. However, Ga\u2032 of s-SBS displayed a very weak \u00cf dependency at both T < T2 and T > T2. Only near T2 did s-SBS decay with \u00cf a little sharply. These indicated, in contrast to l-SBS, that s-SBS still exhibited more elasticity even at T > T2 because of its crosslinking point between the PB blocks (the star structure). In the lower \u00cf range, l-SBS exhibited a stronger peak III than s-SBS despite the same styrene content for l-SBS and s-SBS. The high tan \u00ce value of peak III for l-SBS was considered to be related to the internal friction among the PB blocks or the whole l-SBS chain, not the PS blocks. \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Phase behavior and viscoelastic relaxation of styrene-butadiene-styrene triblock copolymer (SBS) were investigated. Through the TEM observation, it can be found that there exist continuous phases in the SBS and the dimension of each phase can be confirmed. The DSC test reveals that the heating history that samples exposed to have a significant effect on SBS phase structure, especially for PS phase with a small mass proportion in SBS. There is an order-disorder transition with temperature increasing, and the transition temperature is considered to be related to the size of PS domain. The dynamic rheological measurements were conducted to evaluate the viscoelastic relaxation behavior of SBS triblock copolymer at different temperatures. Three relaxation peaks appearing on the temperature dispersion curve of dynamic loss tangent at different frequencies is attributed to the relaxation of various motorial unit of SBS. Differing from PS homopolymer, with the increase of temperature, SBS still presents a high elastic modulus because of the interaction between PS and PB phases, and the entanglement of PB chains. Furthermore, an obvious peak as shown in the dynamic frequency sweep curves is involved in the order-disorder transition when the temperature is beyond 98\u00b0C.",

        "abstract": "The linear viscoelastic behavior and electrical conductivity of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) filled with stainless steel fibers (SSF) were investigated and compared with those of carbon black (CB) filled HDPE composites system.It is found that CB/HDPE composites show two electrical conductivity percolation values (\u03c6 c1 and \u03c6 c2 ) and a wide percolation range.However,SSF/HDPE composites present an extremely low threshold of the electrical conductivity percolation (only 0.3 vol%) and a narrow percolation range.Only one conductivity percolation value (\u03c6c) was observed.The speciality of conductivity percolation behavior of SSF/HDPE composites owes to the formation of conducting channels of SSF/HDPE composites.It is well recognized that the rheological percolation threshold is identical to the percolation threshold of electrical conductivity for CB/HDPE composites.Whereas,for SSF/HDPE composites,dynamics storage modulus (G') becomes almost independent of frequency in the low frequency region as the SSF loading increases up to 4.8 vol%,suggesting an onset of solidlike behavior in SSF/HDPE composites.By plotting G' versus SSF loading,the rheological threshold is determined as 4.8 vol%,which is much lower than the percolation threshold of electrical conductivity,i.e. 0.3 vol%.Additionally,the positive temperature coefficient (PTC) effect was measured for SSF/HDPE and CB/HDPE composites.It reveals that the conductivity channels formed by SSF show a higher stability than those formed by CB particles in HDPE matrix.The difference in the percolation threshold and the stability of conductivity channels are understood in terms of the larger L/D of SSF and the particular conductive mechanism of SSF/HDPE composites",

        "title": "Investigation on the interaction between C16TAB and NaCMC in semidilute aqueous solution based on rheological measurement",
        "abstract": "The rheological behavior of unentangled and entangled semidilute solution of anionic polyelectrolyte sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC) containing cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (C 16 TAB) was investigated. The results reveal that the rheological properties of these semidilute NaCMC solutions depend on the amount of C 16 TAB added. In the unentangled semidilute NaCMC solution (0.5 g/L), the viscosity decreases with the increase of C 16 TAB amount in the low surfactant concentration region (below the critical aggregation concentration, CAC). However, in high surfactant concentrations (above CAC), the viscosity decreases sharply with the increase in C 16 TAB amount. It is found that viscosity change of NaCMC solution could be described using Colby\u2019s model when surfactant concentrations are between CAC and saturated concentration ( C s ), suggesting that no inter-polymer interaction exists between C 16 TAB and NaCMC in the unentangled semidilute solution. However, for the entangled semidilute NaCMC solution (5 g/L), the addition of C 16 TAB leads to an increase in viscosity. Meanwhile, the solution exhibits an enhanced shear thinning behavior due to adding more C 16 TAB than 1 mM. The viscosity increase is ascribed to the physical cross linking of surfactant micelles with NaCMC chains. Furthermore, it is suggested that the enhanced shear thinning behavior results from weak interaction between NaCMC chains and C 16 TAB micelles. Keywords Cationic surfactant Polyelectrolyte Rheological behavior Micelle 1 Introduction Polyelectrolyte and surfactant complex solution have been widely applied in many industrial areas such as coating fluids, laundry products, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. In view of the fact that intrinsic characteristics and rheological behavior of polyelectrolyte solution are greatly influenced by the adding surfactant, an intensive effort had been made to characterize the nature of the interactions between polyelectrolyte and surfactants [1\u20134] . In particular, the interaction between polyelectrolyte and surfactant with opposite charges has attracted great attention [5\u201311] both in academic research and commercial application, since from a physicochemical viewpoint, this interaction is much more complex than that between ionic surfactant and nonionic polymer due to the strong electrostatic interaction [12] . It is noted that the introduction of surfactant into the polyelectrolyte aqueous solution could effectively reduce the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the surfactant. In general, the surfactant molecules can interact with polyelectrolyte to form micelle-like clusters along the polymer chains at a critical aggregation concentration (CAC) [4] , and CAC could be used to evaluate the strength of the binding interaction between surfactant and polymer. Some researches have indicated that the interaction takes place between polyelectrolyte and surfactant monomers when the surfactant concentration is below CAC, and contrarily, the polyelectrolyte\u2013surfactant micelle aggregates dominate [13] . The mixture of the surfactant and polyelectrolyte with opposite charges would precipitate in case of the charge ratio of surfactant to polyelectrolyte approaches 1, due to the improvement of hydrophobicity, for more surfactant binding to polyelectrolyte. Due to excessive surfactant added, the precipitates would be re-dissolved, because the adsorption of additional surfactants on the precipitates increases the hydrophilicity of the precipitates [12,14\u201316] . In addition, it was found the presence of salt could enhance ionic strength of the solution, and as a result, it went against the precipitation [12] . The aggregation of polyelectrolyte and surfactant with opposite charges greatly depends on the properties of surfactant and polyelectrolyte [17] . Moreover, polyelectrolyte\u2013surfactant complexes are originated from electrostatic bonding, and further, stabilized by the hydrophobic interactions of surfactant tails [13] . Therefore, the CAC decreases as the surfactant is made more hydrophobic [18] . The dependence of CAC on polyelectrolyte properties is rather interesting, i.e., CAC decreases with the decrease of polymer\u2019s charge density [19,20] , but increases with both the increase of polyelectrolyte concentration [21,22] and the salt concentration at a fixed polyelectrolyte concentration [23] . The effects of polyelectrolyte concentration and salt concentration were explained by the release of condensed counter ions from the polyelectrolyte when the surfactant bound [24,25] , and the aggregation number of surfactant micelles in polymer solution approached the number of the corresponding surfactant micelles formed in polymer free surfactant aqueous solution [20] . The surface tension [13,26] , conductivity [18,27] , microcalorimetry [12,28] , fluorescence [29,30] , light scattering [31] and NMR [32,33] have been extensively used to probe the interactions between polyelectrolyte and surfactant. In addition, rheological measurement is also believed to be a preferred approach to examine the interactions between polymer blends [34\u201336] . Since the complex of surfactant and polyelectrolyte may result in a change of the polyelectrolyte structure in aqueous solution, its rheological behavior is supposed to be sensitive to the corresponding structure change. However, to our knowledge, few of rheological measurements have been employed to study the surfactant\u2013polymer systems with opposite charges, especially in polyelectrolyte semidilute solutions. The purpose of the present article is to probe the rheological behavior of polyelectrolyte\u2013surfactant systems with opposite charges under shearing within polyelectrolyte semidilute solution, and consequently explore the interaction between surfactant and polyelectrolyte with opposite charges through the test. To achieve the above goal, an anionic polyelectrolyte, NaCMC, and a cationic surfactant, C 16 TAB, is chosen to construct the model complex of polyelectrolyte\u2013surfactant. 2 Experiments 2.1 Materials Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC) was CR grade product of Sinopharm Chemical Regent Co. Ltd., China, with a viscosity-average molecular weight of 4.7 \u00d7 10 4 g/mol and an average degree of substitution (average number of carboxymethyl groups per glucose unit) of 0.6\u20130.8. The chemical structure of NaCMC is illustrated in Scheme 1 . Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (C 16 TAB) was AR grade product of Sinopharm Chemical Regent Co. Ltd., China, and its CMC measured by conductivity is 1 mM at 298 K. All solutions were prepared using deionized water and all materials were used without further purification. 2.2 Sample preparation First, C 16 TAB and NaCMC were put in the vacuum oven at 60 \u00b0C for 48 h to remove the absorbed water. Then, the C 16 TAB and NaCMC aqueous stock solutions with certain concentration were prepared. All mixed samples were prepared by mixing appropriate aqueous solutions of polyelectrolyte and surfactant at a certain ratio to gain the desired composition. The surfactant solution with a certain concentration was slowly added to the NaCMC solution using a micropipette while the solution was gently stirred in order to avoid the premature precipitation of surfactant. The final solutions with certain concentrations were obtained by adding deionized distilled water. For 0.5 and 5 g/L NaCMC solution, the C 16 TAB concentrations were 0\u20131.2 mM and 0\u20135 mM, respectively, because the NaCMC\u2013C 16 TAB complex would precipitate when the C 16 TAB amounts exceeded the maximum concentration mentioned above. 2.3 Measurement methods The conductivity measurements of C 16 TAB + NaCMC aqueous solutions with various C 16 TAB concentrations were performed at 25 \u00b0C using a conductivity meter (DSS-11A, Leichi instrument, China). The KCl solutions with concentrations of 0.01 and 0.1 mol L \u22121 were used to calibrate the conductance accuracy. 100 mL NaCMC solution with desired concentration was put into a thermostatic container, and then 20 mM C 16 TAB solution was added stepwise to the NaCMC solution with a micropipette, gently stirring. An interval of 5 min was adopted for equilibration during measurements. Tensiometric measurements were taken on a calibrated tensiometer (AF-02, Aofang instrument, China) using the maximum bubble pressure method [37,38] . The measurement procedure was the same as those in the above conductivity measurements. The rheological tests were performed at 25 \u00b0C by using an AR-G2 rheometer (TA instrument, USA) with geometry of cone and plate. AR-G2 rheometer is in a mode of stress controlled and its minimum torque is 0.01 \u03bcN m for measuring low viscosity. The shear rates used here were from 0.1 to 100 s \u22121 . To gain complete dissolution and equilibrium, the prepared samples were held 48 h at room temperature before test. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 presents the specific viscosity ( \u03b7 sp ) of NaCMC solutions without adding surfactant at different concentrations. It can be seen that the dependence of \u03b7 sp on NaCMC concentration is manifested in three different cases in the whole NaCMC concentrations region. At low concentrations ( c < 0.1 g/L) and high concentrations ( c > 0.8 g/L), \u03b7 sp increases remarkably with the increase in NaCMC concentration, while at medium concentrations (0.1 g/L < c < 0.8 g/L), the \u03b7 sp increases with the increase in NaCMC concentration more slightly. The calculated slopes of plotting \u03b7 sp \u2013NaCMC concentration curves are 1.08 for low concentrations, 0.57 for medium concentrations and 1.47 for high concentrations, respectively. According to Dobrynin\u2019s theory [39\u201341] and rheological behavior of NaPSS solution reported by Colby [42] , \u03b7 \u221d c holds in dilute solutions, \u03b7 \u221d c 1/2 , in the unentangled semidilute solution, and \u03b7 \u221d c 3/2 , in the entangled semidilute solution. Thus, it is believed that \u03b7 sp \u2013NaCMC concentration curves presented here roughly follow the scaling law of polyelectrolyte solution. Moreover, the NaCMC concentrations of 0.1 and 0.8 g/L correspond to the overlap concentration ( C* ) and entanglement onset concentration ( C e ), respectively. In this paper, we primarily examine the interactions between NaCMC and C 16 TAB in unentangled and entangled semidilute solution. Therefore, two aqueous solutions with NaCMC concentration of 0.5 and 5 g/L, in the unentangled and entangled semidilute solution region, respectively, are chosen. 3.1 Unentangled semidilute polyelectrolyte solution Fig. 2 demonstrates the dependence of surface tension ( \u03b3 ) and conductivity on C 16 TAB concentration in 0.5 g/L NaCMC solution. It is clear that surface tension decreases sharply with the addition of C 16 TAB when the C 16 TAB concentration is less than 0.2 mM. Then, it approximately keeps constant until the C 16 TAB concentration reaches 0.85 mM, which is called as \u201c first plateau \u201d. When the C 16 TAB concentration is higher than 0.85 mM, \u03b3 decreases again and shows so-called \u201c second plateau \u201d phenomenon. It is noted that the beginning concentration of the \u201c first plateau \u201d should correspond to the C 16 TAB\u2019s CAC in NaCMC solution, involving in the onset of the association of surfactant with polyelectrolyte as well as the formation of micelles. On the other hand, the ending concentration of the \u201c first plateau \u201d is the saturated adsorbed concentration of C 16 TAB in NaCMC solution, which is denoted as C s [4] . The \u201cs econd plateau \u201d is believed to be the formations of free micelles in the solution, in which the micelles are not bound by the polyelectrolyte anymore. There exists typical dependence of conductivity on C 16 TAB concentration which reveals that the ionization degree of C 16 TAB monomer in solution is much stronger than that of C 16 TAB micelles when the concentration is above CAC. Moreover, C 16 TAB are completely ionized when the concentration is below CAC and their aggregation would be confined by the ionization due to the strong electrostatic repulsive effect. Hence, the slope of the curve for the concentrations below CAC appears higher than that in higher concentration region. Obviously, the intercept point of two curves is the CAC (0.2 mM) which is in agreement with the CAC value measured by surface tension. Fig. 3 shows the viscosity of 0.5 g/L NaCMC\u2013C 16 TAB complex solution. The viscosity of complex solution is divided into three parts by the two characteristic concentrations, CAC and C s . When the concentrations of C 16 TAB are below CAC, the solution viscosity slightly decreases. However, the solution viscosity falls sharply while the C 16 TAB concentrations are between CAC and C s with increase of C 16 TAB concentration, and becomes a constant if C 16 TAB concentration is higher than C s . The viscosity greatly depends on the NaCMC\u2019s and C 16 TAB\u2019s conformation in solution. At low surfactant concentration region (below CAC), the existence of surfactant monomer in solution in a free form owing to no significant association between C 16 TAB and NaCMC, results in an increases in the ion strength of NaCMC solution which plays an important role in decreasing the hydrodynamic radius ( R h ) of NaCMC. This phenomenon was also observed in Trabelsi\u2019s article [43] . Above the CAC, C 16 TAB starts to associate with NaCMC and cause NaCMC\u2019s R h to decrease due to both electrostatic screen and aggregate of polyelectrolyte and surfactant. Therefore, the viscosity decreases sharply with the increase of C 16 TAB concentration. With further increase of C 16 TAB concentration (higher than C s ), the superfluous C 16 TAB begin to form micelles and freely exist in NaCMC solution. Consequently, R h of NaCMC will never change and the solution viscosity keeps constant. A comparison of data is done using Colby\u2019s theory [44] , in which the viscosity was assumed to be only determined by hydrodynamic radius in dilute solution and unentangled semidilute solution. The dashed curve is simulated by Eq. (1) , in which \u03b7 sp ( c ) and \u03b7 sp (0) are the specific viscosities of polymer with and without added surfactant, respectively, c , c p , \u03b1 , f are the surfactant concentration, the molar concentration of monomers from polyelectrolyte, the neutralization extent and the fraction of monomers bearing an effective charge, respectively. Colby\u2019s theory is suitable for describing the association of surfactant micelles with polyelectrolyte on the premise of the concentration of polyion being higher than that of the surfactants. And the comparison results show that the experimental data between CAC and C s could approximately be fitted by Eq. (1) , indicating that there is no inter-polymer interaction when adding C 16 TAB to NaCMC unentangled semidilute solution. (1) \u03b7 sp ( c ) \u03b7 sp ( 0 ) = 1 \u2212 c \u03b1 c p 1 + 2 c f c p [ 1 \u2212 ( c / \u03b1 c p ) ] \u2212 3 / 4 , \u2003 \u2003 c * < c p < c e 3.2 Entangled semidilute polyelectrolyte solution Fig. 4 presents the dependence of conductivity and surface tension on C 16 TAB concentration in 5 g/L NaCMC aqueous solution. It can be seen that the CAC of C 16 TAB in 5 g/L NaCMC aqueous solution is about 0.5 mM, which is higher than that in the unentangled semidilute solution (0.5 g/L), i.e., 0.2 mM. Hansson [21,22] and Thalberg [45] have also reported that the CAC increased with the increase of polyelectrolyte concentration. This phenomenon is ascribed to the release of condensed counterions from the polyelectrolyte when the surfactant binds. Fig. 5 shows the relationship between viscosity and shear rate for 5 g/L NaCMC aqueous solution with different C 16 TAB concentrations. It can be found that NaCMC\u2013C 16 TAB complex systems present strong shear thinning when the concentration of C 16 TAB is higher than 1 mM and even fail to exhibit a zero shear rate viscosity ( \u03b7 0 ) at the lowest shear rates studied here. Fig. 6 gives the apparent viscosities ( \u03b7 a ) of 5 g/L NaCMC aqueous solutions with various C 16 TAB amounts at different shear rates. At lower shear rates (0.1 and 1 s \u22121 ), \u03b7 a keeps approximately constant until the C 16 TAB concentration reaches 0.1 mM, and then it begins to drop. When C 16 TAB concentration is higher than 0.3 mM, \u03b7 a of NaCMC solution keeps constant again until 1 mM. Subsequently, \u03b7 a increases sharply with the increase of C 16 TAB amount when the C 16 TAB concentration is higher than 1 mM. These results reveal that the addition of C 16 TAB almost exerts no influence on the structure of NaCMC in aqueous solution when the C 16 TAB concentration is less than 0.1 mM. When the C 16 TAB concentration is higher than 0.1 mM, the C 16 TAB could hardly form micelles (as detected from Fig. 4 , the CAC of C 16 TAB was 0.5 mM in 5 g/L NaCMC solution), and perform only screening effect on NaCMC just like the salt. As a result, \u03b7 a of NaCMC solution drops slightly. However, \u03b7 a increases remarkably when the C 16 TAB concentration exceeds 1 mM, suggesting the formation of NaCMC network structure crosslinked by C 16 TAB micelles. In the unentangled semidilute solution discussed above, the surfactant micelle interacts merely with one polyelectrolyte chain, whereas in the entangled semidilute solution, the surfactant micelles behave as a physical crosslinking to bind NaCMC chains and thus increase \u03b7 a of solution. The identical viscosity in the case of C 16 TAB concentration between 0.3 and 1 mM may be ascribed to no obvious conformation change of polyelectrolyte in the entangled region in which the conformation are restricted by the entangled points. Fig. 6 also shows that, \u03b7 a appears constant for almost all C 16 TAB concentrations at higher shear rates of 100 and 1000 s \u22121 . The result indicates that the networks formed by inter-polymer-C 16 TAB micelles are completely broken under high shear rate, because the network structure is too weak and would completely be destroyed by strong shearing. Plucktaveesak [46] reported that the addition of C 12 TAB could result in the viscosity increase of PAA entangled semidilute solution, but could hardly enhance the shear thinning of PAA solution. Why no obvious shear thinning enhancement existed in PAA\u2013C 12 TAB system? Do different structures of polyelectrolyte and surfactant play a key role in their rheological behavior under shear or not? So far as surfactant micelles are concerned, the micelle size of C 16 TAB is larger than C 12 TAB\u2019s. The aggregation number is 58 and 107 for C 12 TAB [20] and C 16 TAB [47] , respectively, which is equivalent in aqueous solution with and without polyelectrolyte [20] . Accordingly, the micelle size of C 16 TAB absorbed on NaCMC should be larger than that of C 12 TAB on PAA. The ratio of the average distance between the adjacent surfactant hydrophilic heads of C 12 TAB and C 16 TAB could be easily obtained from a simple estimation ( r (C 12 TAB)/ r (C 16 TAB) = (58/12) \u00d7 (16/107) = 0.72) based on the radius of surfactant micelle being in direct proportion to the length of surfactant\u2019s hydrophobic alkyl chain [4] . Obviously, the average distance of C 12 TAB hydrophilic heads is smaller than that of C 16 TAB. For polyelectrolyte, the size of NaCMC monomer is larger than that of PAA, implying that the average distance between the adjacent charges of NaCMC chain is larger than that of PAA chain if the two polymers hold the same charge density. Hence, it is believed that NaCMC holds lower charge density compared with PAA if charge density is defined as the number of charges per carbon in a main chain, and microstructures of the two surfactant\u2013polyelectrolyte complexes are different. Fig. 7 presents the two possible complex structure schematics. Because PAA and NaCMC hold the same ionic group carboxyl and surfactants have the same cationic unit, i.e., trimethyl ammonium, the interactions between polyelectrolyte and surfactants should increase with the increase of binding point. Accordingly, it can be interpreted that the density of binding point for NaCMC\u2013C 16 TAB complex is lower than that for PAA\u2013C 12 TAB complex. In other words, the interaction between C 16 TAB micelles and NaCMC is weaker than that between PAA and C 12 TAB. Consequently, the binding points of NaCMC\u2013C 16 TAB complex could easily be broken by shearing and the entangled semidilute NaCMC solution presents an enhanced shear thinning behavior due to the addition of C 16 TAB. 4 Conclusion The rheological behavior of unentangled and entangled semidilute solution of anionic polyelectrolyte NaCMC solution with cationic surfactant C 16 TAB has been investigated. The addition of C 16 TAB to 0.5 and 5 g/L NaCMC solutions influences the rheological properties in a different way. In the unentangled semidilute polyelectrolyte solution (0.5 g/L NaCMC), the increase of C 16 TAB amount added could result in a slight decrease of the solution viscosity in the low C 16 TAB concentration region (lower than CAC), but a sharp decrease in the high C 16 TAB concentration region (higher than CAC). In the entangled semidilute polyelectrolyte aqueous solution (5 g/L NaCMC solution), the addition of C 16 TAB could increase viscosity when C 16 TAB concentration exceeds CAC, and the 5 g/L NaCMC solution exhibits an enhanced shear thinning behavior induced by adding more C 16 TAB than 1 mM. Moreover, the increase of viscosity is ascribed to the surfactant micelles as a physical cross-linker which binds the NaCMC chains together to form a network structure. Furthermore, it is proposed that the enhanced shear thinning behavior results from the low charge density of NaCMC and large distance between the adjacent surfactant hydrophilic heads.

        "abstract": "The phase separation behaviors of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)/ poly (styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (SAN) blends with and without fumed silica (SiO 2) have been investigated using time-resolved small-angle light scattering and dynamic rheological measurements. It is found that the effect of SiO2 on the phase separation behavior of PMMA/SAN blend obviously depends on the composition of the blend matrix. The addition of SiO2 causes the cloud point (Tc) and binodal temperature (Tb) to slightly increase for 60/40 PMMA/SAN, and sharply decrease for 30/70 PMMA/SAN. However, the introduction of SiO2 just causes a small increase of the spinodal temperatures (Ts) for PMMA/SAN with all compositions. Hence, the metastable region of 30/70 PMMA/SAN filled with 5 wt% SiO2 is expanded in large amplitude by the fillers, while the same region of 60/40 filled PMMA/SAN hardly changes. The selective absorption of PMMA on the surface of SiO2 results in the difference between the composition of surface layer and that of polymer matrix, especially for 30/70 PMMA/SAN filled with 5 wt% SiO2. For such system, the phase separation of the surface layer occurs according to an SD mechanism at relatively low annealing temperatures. The SiO2 particles then act as nuclei, inducing the phase separation of the matrix according to NG mechanism. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "The rheological behavior of loach surface mucus was investigated in this paper. The steady shear curves of loach surface mucus can be divided into three regions. The initial shear-independent value attained in the low shear horizontal region of such plots is known as the zero shear or Newtonian viscosity (\u03b70),which is called as the first Newtonian region. Subsequent decrease in viscosity with increasing shear rate ( \u03b3\ue57f) maybe attributed to progressive breakdown of intermolecular network character,which is called as shear thinning phenomenon. With \u03b3\ue57f increasing further,viscosity of loach surface mucus becomes shear-independent again. This region is the second Newtonian region. The relationship between apparent viscosity ( \u03b7a ) of loach surface mucus and \u03b3\ue57f can be well described by the Carreau model. The relationship between specific viscosity ( \u03b7sp ) and concentration ( c) follows \u03b7sp \u221d c1. 5,which is in excellent agreement with that of semidilute entangled polyelectrolyte aqueous solution without salt,suggests it is in the semidilute entangled regime. In the tested angle frequency (\u03c9) region,the storage modulus (G\u2032) and the loss modulus (G\u2033) neither changes a lot with \u03c9. G\u2032 > G\u2033 suggests the loach surface mucus exhibits more elasticity than viscidity. There is a critical temperature,35\u2103 ,for loach surface mucus. Below 35\u2103 ,\u03b7a of loach surface mucus changes little with temperature. Above 35\u2103 ,the loach surface mucus appears heat-denature and exhibits thoroughly different rheological responses.",

        "abstract": "The frictional behavior of poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid)(PAMPS) hydrogel sliding against glass plate in water were studied over a wide sliding velocity region. It reveals that the frictional stress(f) increases with increase sliding velocity(v) at high velocity region, and f \u221d v prevails, which is considered as the hydrodynamic lubrication. However, at small v region, f \u221d v failed and f decreases slightly as v increase, which does not obey the hydrodynamic lubrication mechanism. The decrease of f with v in small v region does not arise from the stress relaxation of PAMPS hydrogel during the measurement but the shearing thinning of PAMPS hydrogel surface network and the mixed lubrication. PAMPS gel with high compressive modulus(E) exhibits high f than that of hydrogel with small E at slow v region, which is not coincide with the model's expectation. At the same time, PAMPS hydrogel with small E is observed to be easy to form hydrodynamic lubrication than that with large E. This is believed to be related to the excellent deforming ability of PAMPS hydrogel with small E.",

Recently, increasing attention has been devoted to developing polymer/graphite (GP) composites for some important applied cases in which electrical or/and thermal conductivity is required [1\u20103]. It is evident that the rheological and mechanical properties of the particle filled polymer composites are much different from those of virgin polymers [3\u20106]. Many researchers have paid their interests to the viscoelasticity of the particle filled polymer composites over the past several decades [4\u20106]. It is also accepted that dynamic rheological measurement is a preferred method for characterizing the morphology of materials because the structure/morphology can be kept under the condition of the small strain amplitudes [6]. In this article, we report the results of a brief study of the dynamic",

        "abstract": "The steady and dynamic rheological behaviors of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC) entangled semi-dilute solution filled with different concentrations of dodecyl-trimethylammonium bromide (C(12)TAB) were investigated. The results reveal that the zero shear rate viscosity (eta(0)) and dynamic modules (G'and G'') increase with C(12)TAB concentration (C(s)), and there exist three scaling regions divided by two critical C(12)TAB concentrations (C(1), C(2) and C(1)('),C(2)('), respectively, from steady and dynamic tests). The increase of viscosity and modules with C(s) is ascribed to formation of network due to C(12)TAB micelles bridging NaCMC chains. The two critical C(12)TAB concentrations implies that the structure evolution of NaCMC-C(12)TAB complex is exposed to three states with increasing C(s), i.e., no network formation, network extent progressive formation and perfect network formation, respectively. Moreover, C(1)('),C(2)(') are a little lower than C(1), C(2), indicating that the dynamic test is more sensitive to detect the structure change of the complex as compared with steady test. Furthermore, it is found that as NaCMC concentration increases, C(1)(C(1)(')),C(2)(C(2)(')), C(1)(C(1)('))-CAC and C(2)(C(2)('))-CAC increase.",

        "abstract": "Interactions between anionic polyelectrolyte, poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), and cationic surfactant, alkyltrimethylammonium bromide (Cn TAB), were investigated by rheological measurements in semidilute PAA solution. The dependences of the rheological behavior on the chain length of the surfactant, PAA neutralization degree, and temperature were discussed. The results revealed that both dodecyl and cetyltrimethylammonium bromides (C12TAB and C16 TAB) could increase the viscosity of PAA solution when the surfactant amounts surpassed a critical surfactant concentration (Cc), and Cc of C16TAB was lower than that of C12TAB at same PAA neutralization degree. The increase of viscosity is attributed to the surfactant micelles bridging of the polymer chains and confine the mobility PAA chain. On the other hand, it is found that the hydrogen bonding also played an important role in the PAA - CnTAB system, especially in lower neutralization degree PAA solution, which results in the viscosity increase rapidly with the added surfactant into lower neutralization degree PAA solution. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2009.",

When temperature was above the phase separation temperature, i.e. cloud point ( T c ) for some PMMA/SAN blends, the slope of plotting log G \u2032 versus log \u03c9 decreased at low frequencies (terminal region), indicating the appearance of phase-separation and existence of heterogeneous structure. We employed a model dealing with complex modulus of the two phases mixture proposed by Kopnistos et al. for describing the dynamic rheological behaviors of PMMA/SAN blends, according to the assumption that the interfacial tension between the matrix and the dispersed phase was independent of local shear and variation of interfacial area, and that the dispersed spherical droplets were nearly monodispersed. It is found that the predicted results were in qualitative agreement with the experimental data of this study. The ratio of interfacial tension \u03b1 to the size of dispersed phase R , \u03b1 / R , was obtained for 80/20 and 60/40 PMMA/SAN blends, and the two different morphology were also observed.

The frictional stress decreases with increase of concentration of HA at low sliding velocity, and the lowest friction appears in HA 10c* (c* is the overlap concentration) solution; after that, it increases slightly with the concentration. By assuming that a continuous HA lubricant layer is formed at the interface, which screens PVA adsorption to substrate, we estimate the thickness of the lubrication film in concentrated HA solution. In addition, we perform frictional measurement in poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) aqueous solutions and proteoglycan solutions. By comparing the frictional behavior with that in HA solutions, we observe a universal relationship between the zero-shear rate viscosity of polymer solution and the friction at low sliding velocity region, regardless the change in the lubricating polymer species. \u00a9 2011 American Chemical Society.",

The steady shear curves of both PVA solution and PVA-PEO mixed solution could be divided into three regions. The viscosity of PVA-PEO mixed solution increase slightly with the introduction of PEO. The results indicated that the elasticity modulus, strength and elongation at break of the films were improved after adding a small amount of ultra-high mass weight PEO and increased with the increase of PEO content. Although the introduction of PEO caused a decline in the crystallinity of PVA, the size of crystalline region of PVA decreased and distributed uniformly. It is believed that the small and uniformly dispersed crystalline regions in fact increase the number of physical crosslinking points and lead to the enhancement of those mechanical performances as well as the glass transition temperature for the blend films.",

        "abstract": "The successful growth of carbon filaments on two different precursors, i.e., the pristine sodium-montmorillonite (Na +MMT), which undergoes reflux at 100 \u00b0C (r-MMT), and the Na +MMT exchanged with Fe 3+ ions (MMT(Fe)), was attained through chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The products obtained were characterized by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Refluxing can make the Fe 3+ ions in the octahedral layer of Na +MMT migrate to the interlayer and exchange with Na + ions. Furthermore, through calcination at 500 \u00b0C, the Fe 3+ ions migrate again to the surface of the clay layer and form iron oxides, which can serve as precursors for the deposition of carbon. Although r-MMT contained less iron than the MMT(Fe), the ultimate yield of carbon components grown was almost the same, indicating that the iron species in r-MMT possess higher catalytic activity. However, on the surface of r-MMT, CVD hardly generated carbon nanotubes with a clear hollow structure but that those with a carbon fiber structure instead. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, recent progress in studies on the characteristic dynamic rheological response for polymer composites was reviewed, mainly depending on the results by the authors, including HOPE filled with conductive particle. PS filled with Sn-Pb alloy, LDPE filled with MMT, PMVS filled with ultrafine silica and PP filled with ultrafine full-vulcanized powdered rubber. Based on the rheological measurements, some new fingerprints that responsed the evolution of morphology and strcutrure for these polymer composites were obtained.

Comparing with the 60/40 (W/W) PMMA/SAN blends, the addition of a small amount of SiO2 particles could increase the phase-separation temperature (Ts) and could hardly result in the changes of phase separation mechanism, namely, both filled and unfilled blends obeyed the spinodal decomposition mechanism. However, for 30/70 PMMA/SAN blends, the addition of SiO2 particles decreases Ts. This phenomenon was attributed to the component difference between the surface of SiO2 particles and the matrix of PMMA/SAN blends.",

The results reveal that the frictional stress (f) for Gel-Al system is higher than that of Gel-glass owing to the strong interaction between PVA gel and Al plate. At the same time, the elastic-hydrodynamic transition velocity (v f) for Gel-Al system is higher than that of Gel-glass system, which also supports the theoretical prediction. In slow sliding velocity region, the interaction between PVA gel and substrate seems no influence on the sensitivity of f to normal pressure. The v f for a system with weak interaction between gel and substrate, such as Gel-glass, will increase with the increase of normal pressure. However, v f for a system with strong interaction between gel and substrate, such as Gel-Al, seems insensitive to normal pressure. In the fast sliding velocity region, the liquid lubrication prevails and f\u221d (\u03b7 \u03bd P) 1/2.",

Effect of CNTs concentration on the morphologies and structures of LDH/CNTs composites was investigated in detail. The results showed that in the case of low (<0.2 g/L) or very high (>4.0 g/L) CNTs concentration, there was a fairly wide size distribution for the LDH particles in LDH/CNTs while distributes uniformly relatively in the region of 0.2-4.0 g/L. The introduction of CNTs has a little influence on the size and structure of LDH crystals. By means of decarbonation treatment and further ion-exchange using surfactant sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate(SDBS), the LDH/CNTs composites with interlayer anion of dodecylbenzene sulfo-group(DBS-LDH/CNTs) were obtained. Then the DBS-LDH/CNTs composites were dispersed in several organic solvents, respectively. The results revealed that the suspension of DBS-LDH/CNTs in 1-butanol, ethanol and xylene kept stable in a long duration while sedimentated quickly in tetrahydrofuran. In addition, the delamination extent for LDH in these solvents ranked as follows: 1-butanol>ethanol>xylene>tetrahydrofuran.",

        "abstract": "The frictional behavior of poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid)(PAMPS) hydrogel sliding against glass plate in water were studied over a wide sliding velocity region.It reveals that the frictional stress(f) increases with increase sliding velocity(v) at high velocity region,and f\u221dv prevails,which is considered as the hydrodynamic lubrication.However,at small v region,f\u221dv failed and f decreases slightly as v increase,which does not obey the hydrodynamic lubrication mechanism.The decrease of f with v in small v region does not arise from the stress relaxation of PAMPS hydrogel during the measurement but the shearing thinning of PAMPS hydrogel surface network and the mixed lubrication.PAMPS gel with high compressive modulus(E) exhibits high f than that of hydrogel with small E at slow v region,which is not coincide with the model\u2032s expectation.At the same time,PAMPS hydrogel with small E is observed to be easy to form hydrody-namic lubrication than that with large E.This is believed to be related to the excellent deforming ability of PAMPS hydrogel with small E.",

        "abstract": "The successful growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on montmorillonite (MMT) precursors treated with different concentrations of ferric nitrate at 50 \u00b0C (MMT(Fe)-50) and 100 \u00b0C (MMT(Fe)-100) was achieved via the in situ chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of acetylene. The as-obtained MMT-CNTs composites were characterized using X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. All Fe(3+) ions were intercalated into the MMT interlayers at either 50 or 100 \u00b0C in the case of [Fe(3+)]/[clay] = 1. However, the iron content in MMT(Fe)-100 increased rapidly with the amount of ferric nitrate added, whereas the iron content in MMT(Fe)-50 did not exhibit significant changes. On the other hand, the physical and chemical adsorption of Fe(3+) onto the MMT surface was believed to be responsible for the great diversity of iron contents in MMT(Fe)-50 and MMT(Fe)-100 at the same [Fe(3+)]/[clay] ratios. Moreover, the CNT yield showed variation similar to the iron content because the CNTs yield depends primarily on the amount of catalyst available. The CNTs embedded onto MMT(Fe)-100 exhibited narrower diameter distributions than those on the MMT(Fe)-50 precursors, with more CNTs with diameters less than 50 nm on the former. It is suggested that a porous structure with many pores formed by iron species and MMT laminas is related to the morphology and structure of CNTs embedded on the surface of MMT.",

        "title": "Influence of dangling chains on molecular dynamics of polyurethanes",
        "abstract": "The effect of dangling chains on phase-separated microstructure and molecular dynamics for polyurethanes (PUs) was investigated. PUs with different dangling chain lengths and polar groups were prepared through changing the types of diol extender. The molecular dynamics was studied by a combination of dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and broadband dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (BDRS). Four relaxations (processes), namely, a secondary relaxation (\u03b2), the soft phase segmental relaxation (\u03b1), the I process associated with hydrogen bond, and Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars (MWS) interfacial polarization process caused by charge accumulation at hard/soft phase interfaces, were detected. The I process occurred in temperatures lower than that of MWS process but higher than \u03b1 relaxation in general. The \u03b2 relaxation remains unaffected with changing dangling chain lengths or polar groups. However, the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the soft phase shifts to lower temperature, and the segmental motion becomes faster with increasing dangling chain length, while the introduction of a polar ester group into the dangling chains makes it slow down, corresponding to a higher Tg, and results in a higher fragility. On the other hand, there is an absence of I process, and the MWS process shifts to higher frequencies when longer dangling chain is introduced. In the case of increasing the hard segment content, the I process reappears and the MWS process slows down. It is suggested that these results are related to the H-bond interactions within hard segments and the micromorphologies of PUs. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "A series of novel polyurethane (PU)/epoxy resin (EP) graft interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) composites with graded length side chains were prepared from toluene diisocyanate (TDI), polytetrahydrofuran glycol (PTMG), EP, trimethylolpropane (TMP), and diol chain extenders. The effects of the side chain lengths, content, and groups on the damping properties and mechanical properties were investigated. Two damping peaks were observed in the PU/EP IPN system, indicating that the peak damping factor (tan \u03b4) increased with increased side chain length at low temperatures. The introduction of an apolar side chain slightly narrowed the damping range. However, the side chain carrying polar groups broadened the damping temperature range. The strong H-bond interaction between the ester group of side chain and the NH of hard segments in PU was believed to favor microphase separation to form a larger-sized domain and induce the appearance of the relaxation peak at high temperatures. Consequently, the effective damping temperature range was broadened. The side chain content tethered in the hard segment remarkably influenced the damping properties of PU/EP IPNs both at low and high temperatures. The width and intensity of the tan \u03b4 peaks of PU/EP IPNs increased with increased side chain content. The mechanical properties (tensile strength and elongation at break) were significantly affected by the side chain content. Thus, an important method of improving the mechanical damping of elastomers by controlling the side chain molecular structure was established. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "In a previous work (ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2017, 9, 34349-34355), a facile approach was reported to prepare thin hydrogel films based on the Marangoni effect. After dripping onto a water surface, a drop of ethanol solution of poly(stearyl acrylate-co-acrylic acid) (P(SA-co-AAc)) spread quickly to form a thin film. The solvent exchange from ethanol to water led to the gelation of polymer solution which turned into a hydrogel film. Here we investigate the scenario and seek for the governing kinetics of the Marangoni-effect-assisted preparation of hydrogel films. By incorporating aggregation-induced emission fluorogens into the P(SA-co-AAc) solution so that fluorescence appears at the gel state, we found that the spreading usually completed before the full gelation of the entire film. The spreading and formation of the gel films were influenced by the molar fraction of SA, f, and the polymer concentration of ethanol solution, CP. The spreading was blocked when CP was too high, whereas the film was fragmented into small pieces when CP was too low. At an intermediate CP, uniform hydrogel films were obtained. Steady spreading at a constant speed was observed during the processes which yielded uniform hydrogel films. Both CP and f influenced the spreading process by tuning the surface tension of the ethanol solution and the viscoelasticity of the gelated film, as suggested by our theoretical model. This work provided kinetic insights into the Marangoni phenomena of viscous polymer solution. The strategy and principle should be applicable to other systems on preparing thin supramolecular gel films with versatile functions.",

In this work, a kind of microscale porous coating was developed. Taking dopamine and hydrophilic fumed silica nanoparticles as initial building blocks, microscale porous coating was constructed via ice templation. Polydopamine bound silica nanoparticles together to form a porous structure network and rendered the coating to have potential for further postfunctionalization. After two-step CVD, the microscale porous coating changes from superhydrophilic to superamphiphobic, exhibiting super-repellency to droplets with surface tension of 73\u201323 mN/m. The influences of concentration of initial dopamine, hydrophilic fumed silica nanoparticles, and dry conditions on the formation of the porous structure have been studied to optimize the conditions.

        "abstract": "To gain insight into nonlinear viscoelastic behavior, e.g. the Payne effect, and in situ visualize the filler structure in a rubber matrix under strain, a methodology was developed to detect and track structural evolution based on fluorescent labeling. As a model system, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with different lateral sizes (nanosheets and microsheets) were labeled with fluorescein (FLU) and then uniformly introduced into the rubber matrix through solution blending. The strain-induced deformation and destruction of the three-dimensional LDH filler structure were directly observed for the first time through laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). The contributions of the breakdown of the filler network, strain softening of the glassy layer and macromolecular disentanglement to the Payne effect were qualitatively determined and analyzed in detail based on the structural information probed via LSCM together with transmission electron microscopy, rheometry and modulated differential scanning calorimetry. The primary mechanism for the Payne effect in this system was then proposed and the macromolecular disentanglement in the rubber matrix played a key role. Furthermore, the enhanced Payne effect with increasing LDH content was ascribed to the strain amplification effect induced by the filler network for the LDH nanosheet filled system and the chain sliding on orientated LDHs for microsheet filled compounds, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Biological fouling, where marine microorganisms attach densely to various submerged surfaces, has been a serious economic problem worldwide. Different from most antifouling approaches based on stiff and solid materials or coatings, a soft and wet coating composed of zwitterionic polymer was prepared in this paper. With the combination of the anti-polyelectrolyte effect of poly-N-(3-sulfopropyl)-N-(methacryloxyethyl)-N,N-dimethylammonium betaine (PSBMA) and the typical polyelectrolyte effect of polyacrylic acid (PAA), a bicomponent hydrogel coating with weak swelling in saline solution was achieved, which could avoid peeling from solid substrates. The bicomponent hydrogel coating showed strong tensile properties and good compression performance and slipperiness. Although the large Youngu0027s modulus of the coating relatively weakens the drag reduction effect, entering the mixed lubrication region in low sliding rate is easy and a low friction coefficient at a high rate could thus be obtained. With the aid of silane coupling agent and weak deformation in water and saline solution, the hydrogel coating could be bound tightly on solid surfaces. After strong sandy water abrasion, the bicomponent hydrogel coating could maintain its original state without any cracks and peeling. The hydrogel coating exhibits good anti-bacterial adhesion and anti-protein adsorption. The bicomponent zwitterionic hydrogel coating reported here provides a new strategy for marine antifouling and drag reduction studies.",

        "abstract": "Synthesis of structure-controlled nanocrystals on target substrates presents an enticing prospect for fabricating multifunctional devices. Herein, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with different morphologies were fabricated via hydrothermal treatment on various substrate surfaces. The morphology of the LDH nanostructures from ultrathin nanosheets, parallel aligned nanoscrolls and vertically aligned nanoscrolls could be finely tuned by adjusting the reaction time, temperature and metal\u2013salt concentration. A speculative model was proposed to illustrate the reaction process where the LDH growth units interacted with the modified surface at first, then gradually formed the nanosheets and finally developed into nanoscrolls upon termination of the reaction. The investigation confirmed that amino groups and a positively charged surface play key roles in the formation of well-defined LDH nanoscrolls. Benefiting from the unique hierarchical structure and high LDH loading, the hybrid nanofiber membranes with vertically aligned LDH nanoscrolls exhibited excellent adsorption capability toward methyl orange and Cu2+ and could effectively separate a surfactant stabilized oil-in-water emulsion solely by gravity, with high flux and oil rejection. Meanwhile, these hybrid membranes have shown great potential as highly efficient catalysts for degradation of organic pollutants, making them versatile and comprehensive materials for water remediation.",

        "abstract": "Self-standing membranes of poly(vinylidene fluoride)@layered double hydroxide (PVDF@LDH) composite fibers were fabricated by using metal salts with different anions (NO3\u2212, Cl\u2212, SO42\u2212) as the reactants through a combination of electrospinning and hydrothermal treatment. The anions have a significant effect on the morphology and loading amount of LDHs anchored onto the surface of PVDF nanofibers. In a monovalent anion (such as nitrate) system, small crystal nuclei were formed. Only a small proportion with a large size grew up to well-defined hexagonal LDH layered nanocrystals with large thicknesses. However in a divalent anion sulfate system, large crystal nuclei were generated first and most of them could grow up to thin and curly LDH layered nanocrystals owing to the serious steric hindrance. Well-defined PVDF@CoAl-LDH composite fibers with a hierarchical structure and uniform core/sheath morphology could only be obtained in the sulfate system, which could act as an excellent adsorbent for treating dye solutions. The obtained PVDF@CoAl-LDH core/sheath fibers present a maximum adsorption capacity of 621.17 mg g\u22121 for methyl orange (MO). Moreover, benefiting from the perfect properties and stable form, the composite fiber membrane could be used directly in membrane filtration with high removal efficiency and cycling stability. The MO removal rate of the membrane remained above 93% with a maximum flux of 140 L (m2 h)\u22121 despite three times of regeneration, indicating its practical application for the efficient treatment of dye pollution.",

In this paper, robust porous poly(melamine formaldehyde) (PMF) sponges with superwettability and controlled pore sizes through introducing layered double hydroxides (LDH) and SiO2 electrospun nanofibers are reported. The LDH nanoscrolls endow the sponge with inherent superhydrophilicity and the SiO2 nanofibers act as pore size regulators by overlapping the PMF mainframe. This approach allows the intrinsic large pores in the pristine sponge to decrease quickly from 109.50 to 23.35 \u00b5m, while maintaining porosity above 97.8%. The resulting modified sponges with varied pore sizes can effectively separate a wide range of oil/water mixtures, including the surfactant-stabilized emulsions, solely by gravity, with ultrahigh permeation flux (maximum of 3 \u00d7 105 L m\u22122 h\u22121 bar\u22121) and satisfactory oil rejection (above 99.46%). Moreover, separation of emulsions stabilized by different surfactants, such as anionic, nonionic, and cationic surfactants has been investigated for further practical evaluation.

With combined theoretical calculation with dynamic mechanical analyses, the adsorbed state of PVA chains on surface of the three LDH particles was proposed, in which PVA chains exhibited various adsorbed states due to different interactions between PVA chains and LDH particles with disparate topological shape. Taking the advantage of remarkable rheological modulation and adsorption capacity, LDH nanoscrolls were introduced into PVA aqu...",

        "abstract": "It is highly desired yet challenging to develop hydrogels with a combination of excellent mechanical properties and good stability for potential applications. Here we report \u03ba-carrageenan/polyacrylamide double-network (DN) hydrogels with remarkable mechanical performances and high stability in water, which are achieved using zirconium ions to further cross-link the first physical network of \u03ba-carrageenan by forming coordination complexes. Thus, obtained DN hydrogels in equilibrated state with water content of 83\u201391 wt % were highly transparent and showed tensile breaking stress of 1.5\u20133.2 MPa, breaking strain of 300\u20132200%, Young\u2019s modulus of 0.2\u20132.2 MPa, and tearing fracture energy of 0.4\u201318.5 kJ/m2. We found that dual-cross-linking of the \u03ba-carrageenan network, i.e., the coiled-coil junctions and the metal-coordination bonds, was indispensable for the combined mechanical properties and stability of these gels. Essential reasons were rationally discussed based on the results of control experiments. The st...",

        "abstract": "Hydrogel films have promising applications in medical dressings, flexible electronics, etc. However, it is challenging to fabricate ultrathin hydrogel films with high toughness and controllable thickness. Here, we report a facile approach to prepare tough physical hydrogel films by spin-coating of a poly(acrylic acid-co-acrylamide) (P(AAc-co-AAm)) solution and subsequent gelation in FeCl3 solution to form carboxyl-Fe3+ coordination complexes. The thickness of the obtained gel films, ranging from several to hundreds of micrometers, was easily tunable by adjusting the spin conditions and polymer concentration. The thus obtained hydrogel films showed excellent mechanical properties, with tensile breaking strengths of 0.6-14.5 MPa, breaking strains of 140-840%, Young's moduli of 0.1-61.7 MPa, and tearing fracture energies of 300-1300 J m-2. Based on this approach, responsive tough hydrogel films can also be prepared by spin-coating of a poly(acrylic acid-co-N-isopropylacrylamide) (P(AAc-co-NIPAm)) solution. The obtained gel films showed a fast response (<60 s) and a large output force (\u223c0.2 MPa) triggered by a concentrated saline solution, making them an ideal material in the design of chemomechanical devices. Furthermore, a bilayer hydrogel film was fabricated by two-step spin-coating of P(AAc-co-NIPAm) and P(AAc-co-AAm) solutions, which showed reversible bending deformation under external stimuli. This simple yet effective approach should be applicable to other systems to prepare versatile hydrogel films with tunable thickness and promising applications in diverse areas.",

        "abstract": "Solar selective coatings draw much attention due to its critical role in solar receiver employed in solar heat power generation. Al/Ti 0.5Al0.5N/Ti0.25Al0.75N/AlN solar selective coating exhibits a high absorptance of 0.926-0.945 in solar spectrum range and low emittance of 0.04-0.06 (82 \u00b0C) in infrared spectrum range. The microstructure of the solar selective coatings by using Al as metal reflector layer had been analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), auger electron spectroscopy (AES), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (XTEM). After long time annealed in air, the coating is observed to lost effectiveness in solar spectrum adsorption. More Ti-N bonds rather than Ti-N-O bonds are observed in Ti0.5Al 0.5N layer. The experimental results also indicate that the crystallization of the adsorption layers is not complete. It is believed that oxygen diffused into the Ti-Al-N layer to form Ti-Al-O-N structure, and the destruction of the four-layer structure, lead to the degradation of the coatings after long time (>192 h) annealed in air at high temperature (500\u00b0C). Compared with the thermal stability in air, the coatings are much more stable in vacuum under high temperature, which makes it is more appropriate to be used in vacuum. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The receiveru0027s emittance and vacuum pressure are the two of great significance issues on the heat-loss which is the main factor reducing the efficiency of the parabolic though systems. In this paper, the thermal steady-state equilibrium method was used to test the receivers\u2019 heat-loss. The receivers with increasing emittance were tested to study the variation of heat-loss. Meanwhile, the variable vacuum pressure in the annulus that affects the efficiency of the system was investigated. The influence of vacuumizing rate and getters on the vacuum pressure and heat-loss were discussed. The result shows that the emittance and vacuum pressure affect the receiveru0027s heat-loss dramatically, and the emittance is the major influence factor on the thermal properties. The receiver with 0.08 emittance and 10 \u22123 \u00a0Pa vacuum pressure has a satisfactory heat-loss of 215.6\u00a0W/m at 400\u00a0\u00b0C. The analysis further reveals that the synergistic effect of both emittance and vacuum pressure on the heat-loss can be reflected by the packaging temperature of the glass tube, and a fitting formula has been established to estimate the receivers\u2019 heat-loss according to the packaging temperature of the glass tube.",

        "abstract": "Highly corrosion resistant, layer-by-layer nanostructured SiN/Cr-CrN/SiN coatings were deposited on aluminum substrate by DC/RF magnetron sputtering. Corrosion resistance experiments were performed in 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 wt % NaCl salt spray at 35 \u00b0C for 168 h. Properties of the coatings were comprehensively investigated in terms of optical property, surface morphology, microstructure, elemental valence state, element distribution, and potentiodynamic polarization. UV-vis-near-IR spectrophotometer and FTIR measurements show that the change process in optical properties of SiN/Cr-CrN/SiN/Al coatings can be divided into three stages: a rapid active degradation stage, a steady passivation stage, and a transpassivation degradation stage. With the increase in the concentration of NaCl salt spray, solar absorptance and thermal emittance experienced a slight degradation. SEM images reveal that there is an increase in surface defects, such as microcracks and holes and -cracks. XRD and TEM measurements indicate that the phase structure changed partially and the content of CrO and AlO has increased. Auger electron spectroscopy shows that the elements of Cr, N, and O have undergone a minor diffusion. Electrochemical polarization curves show that the as-deposited SiN/Cr-CrN/SiN/Al coatings have excellent corrosion resistance of 3633.858 k\u03a9, while after corroding in 5.0 wt % NaCl salt spray for 168 h the corrosion resistance dropped to 13.759 k\u03a9. However, these coatings still have an outstanding performance of high solar absorptance of 0.924 and low thermal emittance of 0.090 after corroding in 3.0 wt % NaCl salt spray for 120 h. Thus, the SiN/Cr-CrN/SiN/Al coating is a good choice for solar absorber coatings applied in the high-saline environment.",

        "abstract": "Many novel, efficient solar absorber coatings are developed in recent decades. However, the methods of qualification tests, such as test of thermal stability, corrosion resistance and prediction of service life that have important engineering significance for solar absorbers to be large-scale applications, are still lacking. Currently, European standard (EN 12975-3-1) and International standard (ISO/CD 12592, 2) are usually applied in conventional situations, such as low- to mid- temperature, slight moisture and sulphur dioxide. However, many other developing industrial countries may face a tougher circumstance, for instance, acid rain, salt mist, sandstorm, smog etc. Therefore, resulting in more complicated ageing mechanisms that the European standard and International standard are no longer well suited. As for the current thermal stability test methods. The customized test method are usually adopted to evaluate the coatings durability during research stage. And the standard test method mainly used to predict the service lifetime for low- to mid- temperature applications. The current problem is how to make up the scarcity of standard test procedure for performance evaluation of high-temperature solar absorber coatings. As for the ageing mechanisms, the most common ageing mechanisms under high temperature are diffusion and oxidation of elements. But, more details on the thermal stability and micro behaviours including element diffusion and distribution, chemical interaction, crystal transition, the surface and cross section ageing morphology of different solar absorber coatings, are still worthy of in-depth study. This paper reviews various solar absorber coatings and thermal stability test methods, evaluates the temperature induced ageing mechanisms, and discusses several commercial applications and challenges in protect the solar absorber coatings. The purpose of this review is to discuss the thermal stability and underlying ageing process of some popular coatings, and the scope for performance improvement. In addition, this paper addresses the new concept of graphene solar absorber coatings.",

        "abstract": "Cyber-Physical Embedded Systems (CPESs) are distributed embedded systems integrated with various actuators and sensors. When it comes to the issue of CPES security, the most significant problem is the security of Embedded Sensor Networks (ESNs). With the continuous growth of ESNs, the security of transferring data from sensors to their destinations has become an important research area. Due to the limitations in power, storage, and processing capabilities, existing security mechanisms for wired or wireless networks cannot apply directly to ESNs. Meanwhile, ESNs are likely to be attacked by different kinds of attacks in industrial scenarios. Therefore, there is a need to develop new techniques or modify the current security mechanisms to overcome these problems. In this article, we focus on Intrusion Detection (ID) techniques and propose a new attack-defense game model to detect malicious nodes using a repeated game approach. As a direct consequence of the game model, attackers and defenders make different strategies to achieve optimal payoffs. Importantly, error detection and missing detection are taken into consideration in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), where a game tree model is introduced to solve this problem. In addition, we analyze and prove the existence of pure Nash equilibrium and mixed Nash equilibrium. Simulations show that the proposed model can both reduce energy consumption by up to 50% compared with the existing All Monitor (AM) model and improve the detection rate by up to 10% to 15% compared with the existing Cluster Head (CH) monitor model.",

M2M networks are considered to be the intelligent connection and communication between machines. However, the security issues have been further amplified with the development of M2M networks. Consequently, it is essential to pour attention into attack detection and forensics problems in M2M networks. This article puts forward the hybrid attack detection and forensics model in M2M networks. It contains two modules: the attack detection module and the forensics analysis module. In addition, we present a distributed anti-honeypot- based forensics strategy to cope with DDoS attacks in the forensics analysis module. Finally, we also discuss some challenges in M2M network security and forensics.",

We analyze the interactions between the attackers and the defenders, and derive optimal strategies for both sides.

MEC makes full use of the computing power of edge nodes, which greatly reduces the computing pressure of data centers, and brings great convenience to the storage and processing of big data. However, it is easy to become the object of hacker attacks due to the lack of centralized management of distributed nodes. Once these nodes are compromised, a series of privacy issues can happen. In this article, we first overview the architecture of MEC for H-IoT. The MEC covers three-level advanced functional entities, including moblie edge (ME) system-level, ME host-level and ME network- level. Second, we draw our attention to the privacy issues in the MEC, especially in data aggregation and data mining. In addition, we consider machine learning privacy preserving as a case study in the application of MEC. Simulation results are shown to reveal the feasibility of the proposed method. Finally, we propose open issues for future work.",

When smart edge nodes use machine learning models to analyze wireless big data, nevertheless, some models may unintentionally store a small portion of the training data with sensitive records. Thus, intruders can expose sensitive information by careful analysis of this model. To solve this issue, we proposed and implemented a machine learning strategy for smart edge nodes using differential privacy. We focused our attention on privacy protection in training datasets in wireless big data scenario. Moreover, we guaranteed privacy protection by adding Laplace mechanisms, and designed two different algorithms Output Perturbation (OPP) and Objective Perturbation (OJP), which satisfy differential privacy. In addition, we considered the privacy preserving issues presented in the existing literatures for differential privacy in the correlated datasets, and further provided differential privacy preserving methods for correlated datasets, guaranteeing privacy by theoretical deduction. Finally, we implemented the experiments on the TensorFlow, and evaluated our strategy on four datasets. The experiment results showed that our methods can efficiently protect the privacy of training datasets and guarantee the accuracy on benchmark datasets.",

Complementing recent work by Parini and Weth in  [15]  on least energy solutions, we prove that  (0.1)  has infinitely many solutions with small negative energy.",

Under certain assumptions on $V$ and $f$,  we prove that this   has infinitely many solutions via variational methods,  which unifies and sharply improves  recent results of Teng (2015) [33].  Moreover, we also consider  above equation with  concave and critical nonlinearities, and obtain the  existence of infinitely many  solutions.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we are concerned with the Schrodinger\u2013Poisson system {\u2212\u0394u+u+u=|u|p\u22122uin Rd,\u0394=u2in Rd. Due to its relevance in physics, the system has been extensively studied and is quite well understood in the case . In contrast, much less information is available in the planar case which is the focus of the present paper. It has been observed by Cingolani S and Weth T (2016 On the planar Schrodinger\u2013Poisson system Ann. Inst. Henri Poincare 33 169\u201397) that the variational structure of (0.1) differs substantially in the case and leads to a richer structure of the set of solutions. However, the variational approach of Cingolani S and Weth T (2016 On the planar Schrodinger\u2013Poisson system Ann. Inst. Henri Poincare 33 169\u201397) is restricted to the case which excludes some physically relevant exponents. In the present paper, we remove this unpleasant restriction and explore the more complicated underlying functional geometry in the case with a different variational approach.",

Developing and testing for production-like conditions is therefore a challenging task. Prior approaches include emulations of the dependency services using either explicit modelling or record-and-replay approaches.

We present a new technique that improves the accuracy of record-and-replay approaches, without requiring prior knowledge of the services. The approach uses multiple sequence alignment to derive message prototypes from recorded system interactions and a scheme to match incoming request messages against message prototypes to generate response messages. We introduce a modified NeedlemanWunsch algorithm for distance calculation during message matching, wildcards in message prototypes for high variability sections, and entropy-based weightings in distance calculations for increased accuracy. Combined, our new approach has shown greater than 99% accuracy for four evaluated enterprise system messaging protocols.",

        "abstract": "Service virtualisation is a supporting tool for DevOps to generate interactive service models of dependency systems on which a system-under-test relies. These service models allow applications under development to be continuously tested against production-like conditions. Generating these virtual service models requires expert knowledge of the service protocol, which may not always be available. However, service models may be generated automatically from network traces. Previous work has used the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to select a response from the service model to play back for a live request. We propose an extension of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, which uses entropy analysis to automatically detect the critical matching fields for selecting a response. Empirical tests against four enterprise protocols demonstrate that entropy weighted matching can improve response accuracy.\n\n",
