        "abstract": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare and represent a diverse collection of malignancies that occur in many organ systems throughout the body, including the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. Unfortunately, the majority of patients with NETs have hepatic metastases at the time of diagnosis. Although some patients may be asymptomatic, others have unusual clinical presentations and variable tumor growth patterns. Although many patients have long indolent courses, without treatment, most patients die within 5 years of diagnosis. This article reviews the care of patients with NETs and hepatic metastases, with emphasis on the increasingly important role of oncologic image-guided interventions.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the role of hepatic arterial embolization (HAE) and chemoembolization (HACE) in patients with large-volume liver metastases. Patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors, melanomas, or gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) with >75% liver involvement who underwent HAE or HACE were included in the study. Radiologic response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and postprocedure complications were assessed. Sixty patients underwent 123 treatment sessions. Of the 48 patients for whom follow-up imaging was available, partial response was seen in 12 (25%) patients, minimal response in 6 (12%), stable disease in 22 (46%), and progressive disease in 8 (17%). Median OS and PFS were 9.3 and 4.9 months, respectively. Treatment resulted in radiologic response or disease stabilization in 82% and symptomatic response in 65% of patients with neuroendocrine tumors. Patients with neuroendocrine tumors had higher response rates (44% vs. 27% and 0%; p = 0.31) and longer PFS (9.2 vs. 2.0 and 2.3 months; p < 0.0001) and OS (17.9 vs. 2.4 and 2.3 months; p < 0.0001) compared to patients with melanomas and GISTs. Major complications occurred in 21 patients after 23 (19%) of the 123 sessions. Nine of the 12 patients who developed major complications resulting in death had additional risk factors--carcinoid heart disease, sepsis, rapidly worsening performance status, or anasarca. In conclusion, in patients with neuroendocrine tumors with >75% liver involvement, HAE/HACE resulted in symptom palliation and radiologic response or disease stabilization in the majority of patients. Patients with hepatic metastases from melanomas and GISTs, however, did not show any appreciable benefit from this procedure. Patients with massive liver tumor burden, who have additional risk factors, should not be subjected to HAE/HACE because of the high risk of procedure-related mortality.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of outpatient management of postbiopsy pneumothoraces with small-caliber chest tubes and to assess the factors that influence the need for prolonged drainage or additional interventions. We evaluated the medical records of patients who were treated with small-caliber chest tubes attached to Heimlich valves for pneumothoraces resulting from image-guided transthoracic needle biopsy to determine the hospital admission rates, the number of days the catheters were left in place, and the need for further interventions. We also evaluated the patient, lesion, and biopsy technique characteristics to determine their influence on the need for prolonged catheter drainage or additional interventions. Of the 191 patients included in our study, 178 (93.2%) were treated as outpatients. Ten patients (5.2%) were admitted for chest tube-related problems, either for underwater suction (n = 8) or for pain control (n = 2). No further interventions were required in 146 patients (76.4%), with successful removal of the chest tubes the day after the biopsy procedure. Prolonged catheter drainage (mean, 4.3 days) was required in 44 patients (23%). Nineteen patients (9.9%) underwent additional interventions for management of pneumothorax. Presence of emphysema was noted more frequently in patients who required additional interventions or prolonged chest tube drainage than in those who did not (51.1% vs. 24.7%; p = 0.001). We conclude that use of the Heimlich valve allows safe and successful outpatient treatment of most patients requiring chest tube placement for postbiopsy pneumothorax. Additional interventions or prolonged chest tube drainage are needed more frequently in patients with emphysema in the needle path.",

For each tumor, computed tomography (CT) density measurements were made at four phases (noncontrast, arterial phase, parenchymal phase, and excretory phase) in each of four CT examinations (before ablation, day 0, 1 month, and 6 months).A total of 36 renal tumors in 34 patients were treated with CT-guided RF ablation in 35 sessions. Before RF ablation, all tumors exhibited enhancement after intravenous administration of contrast material. The peak density was reached during the parenchymal phase, with a partial washout of contrast agent in the excretory phase. On CT images acquired immediately after RF ablation (day 0), 28 of the 36 ablated tumors (78%) exhibited clinically significant homogeneous enhancement (ie, density change >10 HU) within the ablation zone. However, contrast-enhanced CT studies performed at 1 and 6 months revealed no clinically significant enhancements in any of the 36 treated tumors (mean density changes of 4 HU at 1 month and 3 HU at 6 months).Contrast-enhanced CT studies revealed a mild, temporary homogenous contrast enhancement of the ablation zone immediately after RF ablation of renal tumors, which should not be mistaken for a residual, unablated tumor. This enhancement in the ablation zone eventually disappears in follow-up contrast-enhanced CT studies.",

        "abstract": "We evaluated the efficacy of embolotherapy including hepatic arterial embolization and chemoembolization in patients with imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumors with progressive liver metastases.Medical records and computed tomography images of patients with imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor with progressive liver metastases who underwent embolotherapy from January 2002 through January 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. Response was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and modified CT response criteria that assessed tumor density changes. Progression-free survival in the liver and overall survival rates were calculated from the date of the initial embolotherapy session using the Kaplan-Meier method. Correlations between disease status or treatment variables and survival were tested in univariate and multivariate analyses using the log-rank test, and the Cox proportional hazards model, respectively.Fourteen patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor who had been treated with imatinib for 7 to 61 months underwent 26 sessions of embolotherapy. Radiologic response could be evaluated in 13 patients. On the basis of response evaluation criteria in solid tumors, 1 patient demonstrated a partial response and the remaining 12 patients demonstrated stable disease. On the basis of the modified CT response criteria, 7 patients demonstrated a partial response and 6 patients demonstrated stable disease. Progression-free survival rates in the liver were 78.7%, 31.4%, and 31.4% at 6 months, 1, and 3 years, respectively; the median progression-free survival time was 7.0 months. Overall survival rates were 78.6%, 45.8%, and 45.8% at 6 month, 1 year, and 3 year, respectively; the median overall survival time was 9.7 months. Patients who had progressive extrahepatic metastases at the time of treatment and those who received only 1 embolotherapy treatment had shorter OS than did patients with liver-only progression and those who received 2 or more treatment sessions, respectively.Hepatic arterial embolization and chemoembolization induced radiologic response or disease stabilization in most patients with imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor with progressive liver metastases. Patients with progressive extrahepatic metastases or those who are not amenable to more than 1 embolotherapy sessions, however, did not demonstrate an appreciable survival benefit following embolotherapy.",

        "abstract": "We have investigated the feasibility and accuracy of using a combination of internal and external fiducials for respiratory-gated image-guided radiotherapy of liver tumors after screening for suitable patients using a mock treatment. Five patients were enrolled in the study. Radio-opaque fiducials implanted adjacent to the liver tumor were used for daily online positioning using either electronic portal or kV images. Patient eligibility was assessed by determining the degree of correlation between the external and internal fiducials as analyzed during a mock treatment. Treatment delivery was based on the modification of conventional amplitude-based gating. Finally, the accuracy of respiratory-gated treatment using an external fiducial was verified offline using the cine mode of an electronic portal imaging device. For all patients, interfractional contribution to the random error was 2.0 mm in the supero-inferior direction, which is the dominant direction of motion due to respiration, while the interfractional contribution to the systematic error was 0.9 mm. The intrafractional contribution to the random error was 1.0 mm. One of the significant advantages to this technique is improved patient set-up using implanted fiducials and gated imaging. Daily assessment of images acquired during treatment verifies the accuracy of the delivered treatment and uncovers problems in patient set-up.",

        "abstract": "This study was designed to investigate the intratumoral uptake of hollow gold nanospheres (HAuNS) after hepatic intra-arterial (IA) and intravenous (IV) injection in a liver tumor model.Fifteen VX2 tumor-bearing rabbits were randomized into five groups (n\u2009=\u20093 in each group) that received either IV (64)Cu-labeled PEG-HAuNS (IV-PEG-HAuNS), IA (64)Cu-labeled PEG-HAuNS (IA-PEG-HAuNS), IV cyclic peptide (RGD)-conjugated (64)Cu-labeled PEG-HAuNS (IV-RGD-PEG-HAuNS), IA RGD-conjugated (64)Cu-labeled PEG-HAuNS (IA-RGD-PEG-HAuNS), or IA (64)Cu-labeled PEG-HAuNS with lipiodol (IA-PEG-HAuNS-lipiodol). The animals underwent PET/CT 1 h after injection, and uptake expressed as percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g) was measured in tumor and major organs. The animals were euthanized 24 h after injection, and tissues were evaluated for radioactivity.At 1 h after injection, animals in the IA-PEG-HAuNS-lipiodol group showed significantly higher tumor uptake (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and higher ratios of tumor-to-normal liver uptake (P\u2009<\u20090.001) than those in all other groups. The biodistribution of radioactivity 24 h after injection showed that IA delivery of PEG-HAuNS with lipiodol resulted in the highest tumor uptake (0.33 %ID/g; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and tumor-to-normal liver ratio (P\u2009<\u20090.001) among all delivery methods. At 24 h, the IA-RGD-PEG-HAuNS group showed higher tumor uptake than the IA-PEG-HAuNS group (0.20 vs. 0.099 %ID/g; P\u2009<\u20090.001).Adding iodized oil to IA-PEG-HAuNS maximizes nanoparticle delivery to hepatic tumors and therefore may be useful in targeted chemotherapy and photoablative therapy. PET/CT can be used to noninvasively monitor the biodistribution of radiolabeled HAuNS after IV or IA injection.",

        "abstract": "Because of their proximity to the pulmonary artery or vein, hilar lymph nodes are routinely biopsied with endobronchial or endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). Computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous needle biopsy (PNB) allows the operator to acquire a larger core needle biopsy (CNB) when initial samples are inconclusive, when the suspected disease is not optimally diagnosed with FNAB, or when biomarkers are required. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the sensitivity and accuracy of CT-guided PNB in patients with hilar adenopathy.The authors identified 80 patients who underwent 81 CT-guided PNBs of pulmonary hilar lesions from October 2002 through December 2006 and retrospectively reviewed their medical and imaging records. The PNB sensitivity and accuracy were calculated in each case, and each case was reviewed for complications, including pneumothorax and subsequent thoracostomy tube insertion.PNB included FNAB and CNB in 81 (100%) and 14 (17%) procedures, respectively. Data on 69 PNB specimens (67 FNAB specimens and 13 CNB specimens) were available for statistical analysis. Overall, PNB had a sensitivity of 91.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 81.0%-97.1%) and an accuracy rate of 92.8% (95% CI, 83.9%-97.1%). Pneumothoraxes occurred in 39 patients (48%), 26 (32%) of whom required thoracostomy tube insertion.CT-guided PNB of pulmonary hilar lesions has high sensitivity and accuracy and represents a viable alternative for endobronchial ultrasound- or EUS-guided FNAB when larger biopsy samples are required for diagnosis or biomarker analysis. However, the procedure can result in high rates of pneumothorax.",

        "abstract": "Carcinoid tumors have a predilection for metastasizing to the liver. The presence of liver metastases is associated with poor prognosis and also results in significant deterioration of patient's quality of life. Several reports suggest that hepatic artery embolization or chemoembolization can be used for control of liver disease in these patients. We retrospectively reviewed our experience with the use of hepatic arterial embolization or chemoembolization in patients with liver-dominant metastatic carcinoid disease, evaluating the clinical and radiologic response rates, duration of response, and progression-free and overall survival rates of these patients.The medical records of all patients with carcinoid tumors metastatic to the liver who underwent hepatic artery embolization or chemoembolization between January 1992 and December 2000 were reviewed. For the purposes of this study, we compared the follow-up computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging with the baseline imaging to determine each patient's objective tumor response. The interval between the dates of response and disease progression was considered the response duration. Progression-free survival duration was calculated from the date of initial treatment to the date disease progression was recorded or the date of death. Survival durations were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Eighty-one patients (48 men and 33 women; age range, 38-79 years) were included in this study. The mean duration of disease from the initial discovery of liver metastases until embolization was 24.5 months. Fifty patients were treated with bland hepatic artery embolization, and 31 underwent chemoembolization. Of the 69 patients in whom radiologic response could be evaluated, partial response was observed in 46 patients (67%), minimal response (MR) in six (8.7%), stable disease in 11 (16%), and progressive disease in six (8.7%). The median duration of response in the 42 patients with partial response was 17 months (range, 4-51 months). Sixty-three percent of patients had a reduction in their tumor-related symptoms. The median progression-free survival duration was 19 months (95% confidence interval, 17-21 months); the probability of progression-free survival was 75%, 35%, and 11% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. The median overall survival time was 31 months (95% confidence interval, 23-38 months); the survival probability was 93% at 1 year, 62% at 2 years, and 24% at 5 years.Hepatic arterial occlusive therapy using hepatic artery embolization or chemoembolization results in symptomatic and radiologic response in most patients with carcinoid metastases in the liver. The progression-free survival of 19 months achieved with embolization in our study is encouraging, given that most patients had extensive liver involvement and had shown disease progression while receiving systemic treatment.",

        "abstract": "We report our experience with computed tomography (CT)-guided coaxial needle biopsy of deep pelvic lesions by an extraperitoneal approach through the iliopsoas muscle, using a curved needle for difficult-to-reach lesions. We reviewed the records of all patients with pelvic masses who underwent CT-guided percutaneous biopsy via iliopsoas muscle between January 1999 and December 2001. Direct anterior or posterior approach to the lesion was obstructed by bowel, bladder, vessels, or bones in all patients. An 18-gauge guide needle was advanced through the iliopsoas muscle and a 22-gauge Chiba needle was used to perform the biopsy. A custom-tailored curved 22-g needle was used in 17 procedures when the location of the iliac vessels and the slope of the iliac wing obstructed a straight path to the lesion. Fifty-three patients underwent 57 CT-guided needle biopsies during the study period. The lesions comprised obturator (n = 25), internal iliac (n = 11), anterior external iliac (n = 4), and common iliac nodes (n = 4); soft tissue masses along pelvic side-wall (n = 6); adnexal lesions (n = 5); a loculated fluid collection, and a perirectal node. All lesions were safely accessed, and major vessels and viscera were avoided in all cases. Of the 57 biopsies, 53 (93%) yielded diagnostic specimens. No major complications were encountered. CT-guided coaxial needle biopsy by an anterolateral approach through the iliopsoas muscle, with the use of a curved needle in selected cases is safe and effective for obtaining samples from deep pelvic lesions.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the prognostic variables that influence response and survival in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors who are treated with hepatic arterial embolization (HAE) or chemoembolization (HACE).Patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors who underwent HAE or HACE were included in this retrospective study. Follow-up imaging studies were compared with baseline imaging to determine the radiologic response. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the prognostic variables that affected response and survival.The study included 69 patients with carcinoid tumors and 54 patients with pancreatic islet cell carcinomas. Patients who had carcinoid tumors had a higher response rate (66.7% vs. 35.2%; P = 0.0001) and had longer PFS (22.7 mos vs. 16.1 mos; P = 0.046) and OS (33.8 mos vs. 23.2 mos; P = 0.012) compared with patients who had islet cell carcinomas. For patients with carcinoid tumors, multivariate analysis identified male gender as the only independent risk factor for poor survival (P = 0.05). Octreotide was predictive marginally for PFS (P = 0.06). Patients who were treated with HAE had a higher response rate than patients who were treated with HACE (P = 0.004). For patients with islet cell carcinoma, an intact primary tumor, > or = 75% liver involvement, and extrahepatic metastases were associated with reduced OS in the univariate analysis; the presence of bone metastases was the only risk factor (P = 0.031) in the multivariate analysis. Patients who were treated with HACE had a prolonged OS (31.5 mos vs. 18.2 mos) and improved response (50% vs. 25%) compared with patients who were treated with HAE, although the differences did not reach statistical significance.Patients with carcinoid tumors had better outcomes than patients with islet cell carcinomas. The addition of intraarterial chemotherapy to HAE did not improve the outcome of patients with carcinoid tumors, but it seemed to benefit patients with islet cell carcinomas. In patients who had carcinoid tumors, male gender predicted a poor outcome, and a trend toward prolonged PFS was observed in patients who received concomitant octreotide. An intact primary tumor, extensive liver disease, and bone metastases were associated with reduced survival in patients with islet cell carcinomas.",

        "abstract": "Although hepatic arterial chemoembolization (HACE) has been used for treatment of ocular melanoma metastatic to the liver, the prognostic indicators for survival after HACE have not been studied. We evaluated response rates and survival durations after HACE in such patients and analyzed factors affecting their survival.The medical records of patients with ocular melanoma metastatic to liver who underwent HACE at our institution from 1992 to 2005 were reviewed. The radiologic tumor response rates, and overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival durations were calculated, and patient, tumor, and treatment variables were analyzed to identify factors influencing survival.One hundred twenty-five patients underwent 265 HACE sessions. Of 105 patients in whom radiologic responses could be evaluated, 12 (11%) had partial responses, 17 (16%) had minor responses, 68 (65%) had stable disease, and 8 (8%) had progressive disease. The median OS and progression-free survival durations were 6.7 and 3.8 months, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that >75% liver involvement and high lactate dehydrogenase levels were associated with short OS. Patients who had radiologic responses to HACE had a longer median OS duration than did patients who did not (15.8 vs. 6.1 months; P = 0.0005). Patients with >75% liver involvement had a median OS duration of only 2.4 months.HACE resulted in radiologic response or disease stabilization in most patients with ocular melanomas metastatic to the liver. The extent of liver involvement, baseline lactate dehydrogenase levels, and response to therapy were found to be significant predictors of OS after HACE.",

Pigs received transcatheter arterial infusion of a 3:1 mixture of iodized oil and ethanol into the hepatic artery in volumes of 16 mL in group 1 (n = 4), 28 mL in group 2 (n = 4), and 40 mL in group 3 (n = 4) with intent of bilobar distribution. Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement, liver function tests, and volumetry were performed at baseline, at 2 weeks, and before necropsy.Cirrhosis was successfully induced in three animals that received 16 mL of the embolic mixture and in all four animals that received 28 mL. The animals in the 40-mL group did not recover from the procedure and were euthanized within 48 h. Increases in HVPG after 6-8 weeks versus baseline reached statistical significance (P < .05). Correlation between degree of fibrosis and volume of embolic agent did not reach statistical significance, but there was a trend toward increased fibrosis in the 28-mL group compared with the 16-mL group.Transcatheter hepatic arterial embolization can be used to create a reliable and reproducible porcine model of liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension.",

Patients were contacted after their flight and asked to complete a brief telephone survey that assessed for the development of respiratory symptoms during air travel.No patient reported experiencing an in-flight medical event that required emergent, in-flight medical attention or flight diversion. Postbiopsy pneumothorax developed in 65 patients. Of patients with postbiopsy pneumothorax, including patients with radiographic evidence of residual pneumothorax, 50 (77%) traveled within 4 days of the final postbiopsy chest radiograph. Worsening of existing respiratory symptoms or the development of new respiratory symptoms during or after the flight was reported in 14 of 183 patients (8%).This study shows that air travel after biopsy-related pneumothorax can occur safely before radiographic resolution of pneumothorax and as soon as 24 hours after PTNB.",

        "abstract": "We searched the electronic patient database at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center for patients who underwent computed tomography (CT)-guided needle biopsy between January 2001 and December 2005. Inclusion criteria were a known history of haematologic malignancy and a newly detected, undiagnosed pulmonary lesion on chest CT that required tissue sampling for diagnosis; 213 met these criteria. We analysed the biopsy results for diagnostic yield, factors affecting diagnostic yield and effect on treatment. Of 213 procedures, 191 (89.7%) yielded sufficient material for pathologic analysis; 130 (60%) yielded specific diagnoses, while 61 (28.6%) yielded nonspecific benign diagnoses. Lesions larger than 1 cm, cavitary lesions and lung masses were more likely to yield a specific diagnosis than were lesions smaller than 1 cm, lung nodules and consolidations. The most common specific diagnoses were malignancy (62.8%) and infection (34.3%). The latter was more common in patients with leukaemia, cavitary lung lesions or consolidations, active underlying malignancy, neutropenia, respiratory signs and symptoms and/or fever, bone marrow transplant recipients, and in patients receiving chemotherapy. Lung lesions discovered upon follow-up imaging in patients who did not have any respiratory signs/symptoms or fever were mostly malignant. Therapeutic changes were more likely after a specific diagnosis than after a nonspecific diagnosis or a nondiagnostic biopsy (88.4% vs. 18.1%; p < 0.0001). CT-guided lung biopsy has a high diagnostic yield in patients with haematologic malignancies that present with unexplained pulmonary lesions and provides a specific diagnosis in a majority of these patients, leading to therapeutic changes.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to report our clinical experience with out-of-plane computed-tomography (CT)-guided biopsies\n using a magnetic-field-based navigation system. Between February 2002 and March 2003, 20 patients underwent CT-guided biopsy\n in which an adjunct magnetic-field-based navigation system was used to aid an out-of-plane biopsy approach. Eighteen patients\n had an underlying primary malignancy. All biopsies involved the use of a coaxial needle system in which an outer 18G guide\n needle was inserted to the lesion using the navigation system and an inner 22G needle was then used to obtain fine-needle\n aspirates. Complications and technical success were recorded. Target lesions were located in the adrenal gland (n = 7), liver (n = 6), pancreas (n = 3), lung (n = 2), retroperitoneal lymph node (n = 1), and pelvis (n = 1). The mean lesion size (maximum transverse diameter) was 26.5 mm (range: 8\u201370 mm) and the mean and median cranial\u2013caudal\n distance, between the transaxial planes of the final needle tip location and the needle insertion site, was 40 mm (range:\n 18\u201390 mm). Needle tip positioning was successfully placed within the lesion in all 20 biopsies. A diagnosis of malignancy\n was obtained in 14 biopsies. Benign diagnoses were encountered in the remaining six biopsies and included a benign adrenal\n gland (n = 2), fibroelastic tissue (n = 1), hepocytes with steatosis (n = 2) and reactive hepatocytes (n = 1). No complications were encountered. A magnetic-field-based navigation system is an effective adjunct tool for accurate\n and safe biopsy of lesions that require an out-of-plane CT approach.",

        "abstract": "The efficacy of hepatic artery chemoembolization (HACE) was evaluated for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) metastatic to the liver.Records for patients with metastatic GIST who underwent HACE between January 1993 and March 2005 were reviewed and cross-sectional images were used to determine objective tumor response. Progression-free survival in the liver (PFS-liver) and overall survival (OS) were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Patient, tumor, and treatment variables were analyzed to identify factors influencing survival.Of the 110 patients identified, the radiologic response to HACE could be evaluated in 85 patients, 12 of whom (14%) demonstrated partial responses, 63 of whom (74%) demonstrated stable disease, and 10 of whom (12%) demonstrated progressive disease. PFS-liver rates were 31.2%, 8.2%, and 5.4% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively; the median PFS time was 8.2 months. OS rates were 62% at 1 year, 32% at 2 years, and 20% at 3 years; the median OS time was 17.2 months. Patients who had >5 liver metastases and received only 1 HACE treatment were found to have a shorter PFS compared with patients with fewer metastases or those who received > or =2 HACE sessions. Extensive liver involvement, the presence of extrahepatic metastases, and progression of liver disease after HACE were associated with poor OS. Use of imatinib prolonged OS time.HACE produced a durable tumor response or disease stabilization in the majority of patients with GISTs metastatic to liver. Extent of liver disease, presence of extrahepatic disease, number of embolization treatments, and use of imatinib were found to have prognostic influence on PFS, OS, or both.",

        "abstract": "Purpose To assess for nanopore formation in bone marrow cells after irreversible electroporation (IRE) and to evaluate the antitumoral effect of IRE, used alone or in combination with doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles (SPIO-DOX), in a VX2 rabbit tibial tumor model. Materials and Methods All experiments were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. Five porcine vertebral bodies in one pig underwent intervention (IRE electrode placement without ablation [n = 1], nanoparticle injection only [n = 1], and nanoparticle injection followed by IRE [n = 3]). The animal was euthanized and the vertebrae were harvested and evaluated with scanning electron microscopy. Twelve rabbit VX2 tibial tumors were treated, three with IRE, three with SPIO-DOX, and six with SPIO-DOX plus IRE; five rabbit VX2 tibial tumors were untreated (control group). Dynamic T2*-weighted 4.7-T magnetic resonance (MR) images were obtained 9 days after inoculation and 2 hours and 5 days after treatment. Antitumor effect was expressed as the tumor growth ratio at T2*-weighted MR imaging and percentage necrosis at histologic examination. Mixed-effects linear models were used to analyze the data. Results Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated nanopores in bone marrow cells only after IRE (P , .01). Average volume of total tumor before treatment (503.1 mm \u00b1 204.6) was not significantly different from those after treatment (P = .7). SPIO-DOX was identified as a reduction in signal intensity within the tumor on T2*-weighted images for up to 5 days after treatment and was related to the presence of iron. Average tumor growth ratios were 103.0% \u00b1 75.8 with control treatment, 154.3% \u00b1 79.7 with SPIO-DOX, 77% \u00b1 30.8 with IRE, and -38.5% \u00b1 24.8 with a combination of SPIO-DOX and IRE (P = .02). The percentage residual viable tumor in bone was significantly less for combination therapy compared with control (P = .02), SPIO-DOX (P , .001), and IRE (P = .03) treatment. The percentage residual viable tumor in soft tissue was significantly less with IRE (P = .005) and SPIO-DOX plus IRE (P = .005) than with SPIO-DOX. Conclusion IRE can induce nanopore formation in bone marrow cells. Tibial VX2 tumors treated with a combination of SPIO-DOX and IRE demonstrate enhanced antitumor effect as compared with individual treatments alone.

        "abstract": "The absence of user-friendly systems for reporting complications is a major barrier to improving quality assurance (QA) programs in interventional radiology (IR) services. We describe the implementation of a QA application that is completely integrated with the radiology dictation system. We implemented an IR QA process as a module within the electronic medical record and radiologist dictation system applications used at our institution. After a radiologist completes a dictation, he or she must select from a drop-down list of complications before proceeding to the next case. Delayed QA events can be entered using the same applications. All complication entries are sent to a database, which is queried to run reports. During the study period, all the 20,034 interventional procedures were entered in the QA database, 1,144 complications were reported, 110 (9.6%) of which were classified as major. Although majority of the complications (996) were entered at the time of dictation, 148 complications (12.9%) were entered afterwards. All major complications were referred to the IR peer review committee, and 30 of these were discussed in the morbidity and mortality meetings. We studied post-lung-biopsy pneumothorax and chest tube rates and initiated a quality improvement process based on the results.The integration of the IR QA reporting system into the workflow process and the mandatory requirements for completion has the potential to minimize the work effort required to enter complication data, and improve participation in the QA process.",

The treatment of patients with these pathologies is often based on the results of image-guided biopsies. CT and ultrasonography have been used successfully for targeting and sampling mediastinal, hilar, and pleural masses, with high sensitivity and near-perfect specificity. These procedures are performed by interventional radiologists in an outpatient setting with local anesthesia and conscious sedation. Major complications are rare, and the minor complications seen are easily managed. Minimally invasive, image-guided biopsy often obviates the need for more invasive procedures such as thoracoscopy or mediastinoscopy.",

Improvements in needle designs, development of new biopsy techniques, and continual advances in image-guidance technology have improved the safety and efficacy of the procedure. Lesions previously considered relatively inaccessible can now be safely biopsied. This review looks at the recent technologic developments in image guidance for percutaneous biopsy procedures. Improvements in needle design and other innovations intended to enhance the diagnostic yield of biopsy specimens are briefly discussed. Also described are some new techniques and unconventional approaches that help provide safe access to difficult-to-reach lesions.",

        "abstract": "Purpose To determine the effects of irreversible electroporation (IRE) on the neural tissues after ablation in the epidural space of the porcine spine. Materials and Methods The institutional animal care and use committee approved this study. With the IRE electrode positioned in the right lateral recess of the spinal epidural space, 20 IRE ablations were performed with computed tomographic (CT) guidance by using different applied voltages in four animals that were euthanized immediately after magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the spine, performed 6 hours after IRE (terminal group). Histopathologic characteristics of the neural tissues were assessed and used to select a voltage for a survival study. Sixteen CT-guided IRE ablations in the epidural space were performed by using 667 V in four animals that were survived for 7 days (survival group). Clinical characteristics, MR imaging findings (obtained 6 hours after IRE and before euthanasia), histopathologic characteristics, and simulated electric field strengths were assessed. A one-way analysis of variance was used to compare the simulated electric field strength to histologic findings. Results The mean distance between the IRE electrode and the spinal cord and nerve root was 1.71 mm \u00b1 0.90 and 8.47 mm + 3.44, respectively. There was no clinical evidence of paraplegia after IRE ablation. MR imaging and histopathologic examination showed no neural tissue lesions within the spinal cord; however, five of 16 nerve roots (31.2%) demonstrated moderate wallerian degeneration in the survival group. The severity of histopathologic injury in the survival group was not significantly related to either the simulated electric field strength or the distance between the IRE electrode and the neural structure (P > .05). Conclusion Although the spinal cord appears resistant to the toxic effects of IRE, injury to the nerve roots may be a limiting factor for the use of IRE ablation in the epidural space.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to play a crucial role in cancer progression and metastasis. In order to clarify the validity of the rabbit VX2 liver cancer model, we questioned if it expresses ALDH1 as a potential marker of CSCs. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a common malignancy worldwide and has poor prognosis. Most of the animal models used to study hepatocellular carcinoma are rodent models which lack clinical relevance. The rabbit VX2 model is a large animal model useful for preclinical and for developing drugs targeting cancer stem cells.",

Methods: Pts refractory to at least 1 prior therapy, were adaptively randomized (AR), in this phase II, multi-center study, after tumor biopsy and exclusion of sensitizing EGFR mutations (mut+) or ALK fusions to 4 arms: erlotinib (E) 150 mg qd, E plus the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 (M) 135 mg q week, M 100 mg q week plus the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 (A) 100 mg qd, and sorafenib (S) 400 mg bid. The primary objective is 8-week disease control rate (DCR). In Stage 1, 200 pts are randomized and in Stage 2, AR of 200 pts will incorporate the best predictive biomarkers from Stage 1, to be derived from protein expression, gene expression profiling, 16-gene Sequenom mutation analysis and next generation sequencing...",

        "abstract": "Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a novel non-thermal ablative treatment for cancer patients with unresectable tumor. IRE kills tumor cells by applying a strong electric field across the cell membrane, thereby creating irreparable pores. Compared to conventional thermal ablation, IRE is effective in perivascular tissues and can preserve the surrounding sensitive structures. However, tumor cells may survive in the regions exposed to insufficient electric field strength, and cause tumor relapse afterwards. We prepared a doxorubicin-loaded polymeric micelles system (M-Dox) using oil-in-water emulsion. The resultant M-Dox was 37.9 \u00b1 3.2 nm in size with a Dox loading of 4.3% by weight. M-Dox is toxic to multiple human cancer cell lines with IC values in nanomolar and micromolar range. When combined with IRE in a hepatic carcinoma mouse xenograft model, the tumor treated with the combination therapy (IRE + M-Dox) was the highest in both M-Dox uptake and percentage of necrosis. Immunohistochemical staining also confirmed that the fewest proliferating cells were present after the combination therapy. Our data suggested that M-Dox was an effective adjuvant treatment to enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of IRE.",

Tumors treated with IRE + M-Dox had the highest M-Dox uptake and percentage of necrotic cells, compared with the monotherapy and control groups. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed that the combination group had the fewest proliferating cells. Our data suggest that adjuvant...",

        "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) accounts for over 90% of all pancreatic cancer. Nanoparticles (NPs) offer new opportunities for image-guided therapy owing to the unique physicochemical properties of the nanoscale effect and the multifunctional capabilities of NPs. However, major obstacles exist for NP-mediated cancer theranostics, especially in PDAC. The hypovascular nature of PDAC may impede the deposition of NPs into the tumor after systemic administration, and most NPs localize predominantly in the mononuclear phagocytic system, leading to a relatively poor tumor-to-surrounding-organ uptake ratio. Image guidance combined with minimally invasive interventional procedures may help circumvent these barriers to poor drug delivery of NPs in PDAC. Interventional treatments allow regional drug delivery, targeted vascular embolization, direct tumor ablation, and the possibility of disrupting the stromal barrier of PDAC. Interventional treatments also have potentially fewer complications, faster recovery, and lower cost compared with conventional therapies. This work is an overview of current image-guided interventional cancer nanotheranostics with specific attention given to their applications for the management of PDAC.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Combining image-guided therapy techniques for the treatment of liver cancers is a strategy that is being used to improve local tumor control rates. Here, we evaluate the intratumoral uptake of nanoparticles used in combination with radiofrequency ablation (RFA), irreversible electroporation (IRE), or laser induced thermal therapy (LITT). Eight rabbits with VX2 tumor in the liver underwent one of four treatments: (i) nanoembolization (NE) with radiolabeled, hollow gold nanoparticles loaded with doxorubicin (\u2076\u2074Cu-PEG-HAuNS-DOX); (ii) NE + RFA; (iii) NE + IRE; (iv) NE +LITT. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging was obtained 1-hr or 18-hrs after intervention. Tissue samples were collected for autoradiography and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. PET/CT imaging at 1-hr showed focal deposition of oil and nanoparticles in the tumor only after NE+ RFA but at 18-hrs, all animals had focal accumulation of oil and nanoparticles in the tumor region. Autoradiograph analysis demonstrated nanoparticle deposition in the tumor and in the ablated tissues adjacent to the tumor when NE was combined with ablation. TEM results showed the intracellular uptake of nanoparticles in tumor only after NE + IRE. Nanoparticles demonstrated a structural change, suggesting direct interaction, potentially leading to drug release, only after NE + LITT. The findings demonstrate that a combined NE and ablation treatment technique for liver tumors is feasible, resulting in deposition of nanoparticles in and around the tumor. Depending on the ablative energy applied, different effects are seen on nanoparticle localization and structure. These effects should be considered when designing nanoparticles for use in combination with ablation technologies.",

        "abstract": "IFN-alpha consists of a family of highly homologous proteins, which exert pleiotropic effects on a wide variety of cell types. The biologic activities of IFN-alpha are mediated by its binding to a multicomponent receptor complex resulting in the activation of the Janus kinase-STAT signaling pathway. In most cell types, activation of Stat1 and Stat2 by IFN-alpha leads to the formation of either STAT homo-/heterodimers or of the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 complex composed of Stat1, Stat2, and p48, a non-STAT protein. These distinct transcriptional complexes then target two different sets of cis-elements, gamma-activated sites and IFN-stimulated response elements. Here, we report that IFN-alpha can activate complexes containing Stat6, which, until now, has been primarily associated with signaling by two cytokines with biologic overlap, IL-4 and IL-13. Induction of Stat6 complexes by IFN-alpha appears to be cell type specific, given that tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6 in response to IFN-alpha is predominantly detected in B cells. Activation of Stat6 by IFN-alpha in B cells is accompanied by the formation of novel Stat2:Stat6 complexes, including an IFN-stimulated gene factor 3-like complex containing Stat2, Stat6, and p48. B cell lines resistant to the antiproliferative effects of IFN-alpha display a decrease in the IFN-alpha-mediated activation of Stat6. Activation of Stat6 as well as of Stat2:Stat6 complexes by IFN-alpha in B cells may allow modulation of target genes in a cell type-specific manner.",

Our studies indicate that interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-4 is both a target and a modulator of the IL-4 signaling cascade. IRF-4 expression is strongly upregulated upon costimulation of B cells with CD40 and IL-4. Furthermore, we find that IRF-4 can interact with signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)6 and drive the expression of IL-4-inducible genes. The transactivating ability of IRF-4 is blocked by the repressor factor BCL-6. Since expression of IRF-4 is mostly confined to lymphoid cells, these data provide a potential mechanism by which IL-4-inducible genes can be regulated in a lineage-specific manner.",

A delineation of the mechanisms that underlie the inappropriate synthesis of IL-17 and IL-21 in autoimmune diseases can thus provide important insights into potential therapies for these disorders. Here we have shown that the serine-threonine kinase Rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2) becomes activated in mouse T cells under Th17 skewing conditions and phosphorylates interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), a transcription factor that is absolutely required for the production of IL-17 and IL-21. We furthermore demonstrated that ROCK2-mediated phosphorylation of IRF4 regulated the synthesis of IL-17 and IL-21 and the differentiation of Th17 cells. Whereas CD4+ T cells from WT mice activated ROCK2 physiologically under Th17 conditions, CD4+ T cells from 2 different mouse models of spontaneous autoimmunity aberrantly activated ROCK2 under neutral conditions. Moreover, administration of ROCK inhibitors ameliorated the deregulated production of IL-17 and IL-21 and the inflammatory and autoantibody responses observed in these autoimmune mice. Our findings thus uncover a crucial link among ROCK2, IRF4, and the production of IL-17 and IL-21 and support the idea that selective inhibition of ROCK2 could represent an important therapeutic regimen for the treatment of autoimmune disorders.",

The pathogenic effects of IL-21 are partly due to its ability to promote the generation of T H -17 cells. Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF4) is a crucial regulator of IL-17 and IL-21 production. We recently found that the serine-threonine kinase ROCK2 phosphorylates IRF4 and regulates its ability to control IL-17 and IL-21 production. Here we show that NOD T cells aberrantly activate ROCK2. We furthermore demonstrate that ROCK inhibition corrects the abnormal IRF4 function in NOD T cells and diminishes their production of IL-17 and IL-21. Importantly, administration of a ROCK inhibitor to NOD mice protects against diabetes development. These studies thus support the idea that ROCK2 is inappropriately activated in NOD T cells and that ROCK kinases could represent important therapeutic targets for the treatment of T1D.",

Given the potentially deleterious effects of Th17 cells, their generation needs to be strictly controlled. IRF-4 is a transcription factor that has recently emerged as a key regulator of Th17 cell differentiation. Here, we showed that mice deficient in a previously isolated protein, IBP (IRF-4-binding protein), rapidly developed rheumatoid arthritis-like joint disease and large-vessel vasculitis. The pathology was associated with an enhanced responsiveness of T cells to low levels of stimulation and with the inappropriate synthesis of IL-17 and IL-21. IBP sequestered IRF-4 and prevented it from targeting the transcriptional regulatory regions of the genes that encode IL-17 and IL-21. Thus, IBP appears to be important in preventing T cell-mediated autoimmunity by ensuring that the production of IL-17 and IL-21 does not occur in response to self-antigens.",

Here we demonstrate that loss of IBP leads to the spontaneous development of a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by the accumulation of effector/memory T cells and IgG+ B cells, profound hypergammaglobulinemia, and autoantibody production. Similar to human SLE, this syndrome primarily affects females. T cells from IBP-deficient mice are resistant to death in vitro as well as in vivo and exhibit selective defects in effector function. In the absence of IBP, T cells respond suboptimally to TCR engagement, as demonstrated by diminished ERK1/2 activation, decreased c-Fos induction, impaired immunological synapse formation, and defective actin polymerization. Transduction of IBP-deficient T cells with a WT IBP protein, but not with an IBP mutant lacking the Dbl-like domain required for Rho GTPase activation, rescues the cytoskeletal defects exhibited by these cells. Collectively, these findings indicate that IBP, a novel regulator of Rho GTPases, is required for optimal T cell effector function, lymphocyte homeostasis, and the prevention of systemic autoimmunity.",

        "abstract": "Interferon Regulatory Factors (IRFs) play fundamental roles in dendritic cell (DC) differentiation and function. In particular, IRFs are critical transducers of TLR signaling and dysregulation in this family of factors is associated with the development of autoimmune disorders such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). While several IRFs are expressed in DCs their relative contribution to the aberrant phenotypic and functional characteristics that DCs acquire in autoimmune disease has not been fully delineated. Mice deficient in both DEF6 and SWAP-70 (= Double-knock-out or DKO mice), two members of a unique family of molecules that restrain IRF4 function, spontaneously develop a lupus-like disease. Although autoimmunity in DKO mice is accompanied by dysregulated IRF4 activity in both T and B cells, SWAP-70 is also known to regulate multiple aspects of DC biology leading us to directly evaluate DC development and function in these mice. By monitoring Blimp1 expression and IL-10 competency in DKO mice we demonstrate that DCs in these mice exhibit dysregulated IL-10 production, which is accompanied by aberrant Blimp1 expression in the spleen but not in the peripheral lymph nodes. We furthermore show that DCs from these mice are hyper-responsive to multiple TLR ligands and that IRF4 plays a differential role in in these responses by being required for the TLR4-mediated but not the TLR9-mediated upregulation of IL-10 expression. Thus, DC dysfunction in lupus-prone mice relies on both IRF4-dependent and IRF4-independent pathways.",

The pathways that regulate ABCs in autoimmunity are largely unknown.

Notably, DEF6 is a newly identified human risk variant for systemic lupus erythematosus. Here we found that the lupus syndrome that developed in SWEF-deficient mice was accompanied by the accumulation of ABCs that produced autoantibodies after stimulation. ABCs from SWEF-deficient mice exhibited a distinctive transcriptome and a unique chromatin landscape characterized by enrichment for motifs bound by transcription factors of the IRF and AP-1 families and the transcription factor T-bet. Enhanced ABC formation in SWEF-deficient mice was controlled by the cytokine IL-21 and IRF5, whose variants are strongly associated with lupus. The lack of SWEF proteins led to dysregulated activity of IRF5 in response to stimulation with IL-21. These studies thus elucidate a previously unknown signaling pathway that controls ABCs in autoimmunity.",

        "abstract": "Treg cells need to acquire an effector phenotype to function in settings of inflammation. Whether effector Treg cells can limit disease severity in lupus is unknown. Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF-4) is an essential controller of effector Treg cells and regulates their ability to express interleukin-10 (IL-10). In non-Treg cells, IRF-4 activity is modulated by interactions with DEF-6 and its homolog switch-associated protein 70 (SWAP-70). Although mice lacking both DEF-6 and SWAP-70 (double-knockout [DKO] mice) develop lupus, they display normal survival, suggesting that in DKO mice, Treg cells can moderate disease development. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Treg cells from DKO mice have an increased capacity to become effector Treg cells due to the ability of DEF-6 and SWAP-70 to restrain IRF-4 activity.Treg cells were evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (BLIMP-1)/IL-10 axis was assessed by crossing DKO mice with BLIMP-1-YFP-10BiT dual-reporter mice. Deletion of IRF-4 in Treg cells from DKO mice was achieved by generating FoxP3(Cre) IRF-4(fl/fl) DKO mice.The concomitant absence of DEF-6 and SWAP-70 led to increased numbers of Treg cells, which acquired an effector phenotype in a cell-intrinsic manner. In addition, Treg cells from DKO mice exhibited enhanced expression of the BLIMP-1/IL-10 axis. Notably, DKO effector Treg cells survived and expanded as disease progressed. The accumulation of Treg cells from DKO mice was associated with the up-regulation of genes controlling autophagy. IRF-4 was required for the expansion and function of effector Treg cells from DKO mice.This study revealed the existence of mechanisms that, by acting on IRF-4, can fine-tune the function and survival of effector Treg cells in lupus. These findings suggest that the existence of a powerful effector Treg cell compartment that successfully survives in an unfavorable inflammatory environment could limit disease development.",

        "abstract": "Background  A novel subset of B cells termed Age-associated B cells (ABCs) has been recently reported to preferentially accumulate with age in female mice. ABCs are characterised by high expression of CD11c and CD11b and low levels of CD21 and CD23. ABC differentiation depends on the transcription factor T-bet and is promoted by TLR7 stimulation. While ABCs have been proposed to play a key role in the development of autoimmune diseases and in the gender bias observed in these disorders the molecular mechanisms driving ABC differentiation are poorly understood. Our laboratory has previously identified a novel protein termed DEF6, which shows significant homology to SWAP-70. DEF6 and SWAP-70 are the only two members of a unique family of multifunctional proteins that regulate both Rac activation as well as IRF4 function. Mice deficient in both DEF6 and SWAP-70 (DKO mice) spontaneously develop a lupus-like disease on a C57BL/6 background. Notably, the lupus-like disorder in DKO mice shares several features with human SLE, including exhibiting a sex-bias, and the DEF6 locus has recently been identified as a new SLE risk variant.  Materials and methods  CD11c+ CD11b+ B220+ CD19+ B cells (ABCs) were analysed  in vivo  in WT and DKO mice by FACS. We investigated the role of IL-21 and SAP  in vivo  by crossing DKO mice with mice lacking these molecules. ABCs were generated  in vitro  by culturing CD23+ follicular B cells with \u03b1IgM, \u03b1CD40, and IL-21 in the presence/absence of TLR7 ligand. ABC markers and gene expression were analysed by FACS and qPCR.  Results  We have found that female DKO mice exhibit a marked accumulation of ABCs. The expansion of ABCs observed  in vivo  in DKO mice is dependent on both IL-21 and T-B cell interactions as demonstrated by a significant reduction of ABCs in DKO mice that also lack either IL-21 or SAP. We have also generated male Yaa-DKO mice, which carry a duplication of the TLR7 gene on the Y chromosome. Yaa-DKO males exhibit an even greater expansion of ABCs, which correlates with high titers of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies.  In vitro  stimulation of CD23 + B cells with \u03b1BCR, \u03b1CD40, and IL-21, furthermore demonstrates that B cells from DKO mice are hyper-responsive to IL-21 and strongly upregulate CD11c and CD11b.  Conclusions  Our study demonstrates that the absence of DEF6, a genetic risk factor for lupus, leads to the aberrant expansion of ABCs, a novel B cell subset previously associated with the development of autoimmunity. We furthermore show that accumulation of ABCs in lupus is dependent on T-B cell interactions and IL-21.",

        "abstract": "Gene-environment interactions are known to play a key role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) is one of the strongest environmental risk factors associated with RA and has been shown to mediate a range of complex immunomodulatory effects from decreased T and B cell activation to depressed phagocytic function. The effects of CS on the function of TH17 cells, one of the key TH effector subsets implicated in RA pathogenesis, are not fully understood. IRF4 is one of the crucial transcription factors involved in TH-17 differentiation and is absolutely required for the production of IL-17 and IL-21 but, interestingly, inhibits the synthesis of IL-22. The production of IL-17 and IL-21 by IRF4 can be augmented by its phosphorylation by the serine-threonine kinase ROCK2. Given that CS has been reported to increase ROCK activity in endothelial cells, here we investigated the effects of CS on the ROCK2-IRF4 axis in T cells. Surprisingly, we found that CS leads to decreased ROCK2 activation and IRF4 phosphorylation in T cells. This effect was associated with increased IL-22 production. Using a GEF pull-down assay we furthermore identify ARHGEF1 as a key upstream regulator of ROCK2 whose activity in T cells is inhibited by CS. Thus CS can inhibit the ROCK2-IRF4 axis and modulate T cell production of IL-22.",

A total 155 cases of generalized peritonitis were surgically treated at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences between 1981 and 1987, all patients undergoing peritoneal toilet with drainage after the cause of their peritonitis had been treated. The most common cause of peritonitis was peptic ulcer perforation, with simple closure being associated with a 2 per cent mortality, while typhoid perforation was the second most common cause. The diagnosis was clinical, supported by the operative findings of a terminal ileal perforation while bacteriological, serological and histopathological confirmation was retrospective. Appendicular perforations were less common than in the west but the clinical picture was the same. Tubercular perforations were not uncommon with a previous history of subacute intestinal obstruction and evidence of tuberculosis on chest X-ray suggesting the diagnosis. Ruptured amebic liver abscess was the most common hepatobiliary cause of generalized peritonitis with drainage of the abscess producing good results. The average hospital stay was 15 days with an overall mortality of 8 per cent.",

        "abstract": "Pulmonary infections have been implicated as the most common cause of infection related mortality in renal transplant recipients. An appropriate empirical treatment of post transplant pulmonary infections requires knowledge of the spectrum of the microorganisms involved in causing these infections. Besides this knowledge, an aggressive diagnostic approach including the use of invasive tests is often essential to make an early diagnosis for instituting timely and appropriate therapy. We carried out a prospective cohort study to analyze the spectrum of pulmonary infections in these patients and study the utility of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in the diagnosis of the same.From September 2001 to December 2002, 428 patients were under follow up with the department. In all, 40 renal transplant recipients reported with 44 episodes of pulmonary infection during this study period. All patients underwent detailed and appropriate investigations including specific laboratory tests, sputum analysis, X-ray chest, CT and BAL. The spectrum of the causative organisms and the utility of BAL as compared to the other methods of diagnosis were studied and compared.Out of the 44 episodes of pulmonary infection evaluated, single causative organism could be found in only 24 (54.5%) episodes and multiple etiologies were found in 15 (34.1%) episodes. No definitive cause could be found in 5 episodes. Out of 57 organisms isolated in the 44 episodes, 20 (45.4 %) were bacteria, 16 (36.3 %) each were M. tuberculosis and fungus, 3 were CMV infection and 2 were nocardia. BAL gave a diagnostic yield of 75.8% (25 out of 33 cases). Nine of forty patients died (mortality rate 22.5%) of which 6 deaths could be attributed directly to pulmonary infection. Out of these 9 patients who died, cause of pulmonary infection was bacterial in 5, fungal in 2 and CMV disease in 1. In one patient, organism could not be isolated.Our study has shown that more than 1/3rd of pulmonary infections in renal transplant recipients can be attributed to multiple organisms. Bacterial infections were the commonest cause of post transplant pulmonary infection. Tuberculosis is common cause of pulmonary infection in these patients in our set up. Because of its high diagnostic yield, BAL should be considered in all patients with suspected pulmonary infections in the post transplant period.",

        "title": "Hepatitis C virus infection in haemodialysis: the 'no-isolation' policy should not be generalized.",
        "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most common blood-borne viral infection in haemodialysis. It causes significant morbidity and long-term mortality. Practice of universal precautions has been reported to be sufficient to prevent HCV seroconversion in dialysis units. However, the seroconversion rate remains very high in many dialysis units. A previous study from 1995 to 1998 at our own hospital without isolation showed that nosocomial transmission is the major cause of HCV seroconversion. The present study was therefore conducted with the aim to study the impact of isolation on HCV seroconversion. In this prospective cohort study, with non-probability consecutive sampling, patients with HCV infection were dialysed in an isolated room. In addition, standard universal precautions were practiced. HCV seroconversion rate was compared with the previous study. All patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) admitted to our hospital for renal replacement therapy were included in the present study. At the time of admission, HCV screening was done. All anti-HCV-positive patients were dialysed in an isolated room. While on maintenance haemodialysis, all patients were monthly tested for anti-HCV, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. Any patient who had HCV seroconversion was transferred to an isolated room for maintenance haemodialysis. Patients with HCV infection were managed by further testing for HCV-RNA and liver biopsy. Every patient who ultimately received renal transplantation at our hospital was also tested for HCV just prior to renal transplantation as well as 3 months after renal transplantation. HCV infection was diagnosed by detecting anti-HCV antibodies using an ELISA-based third-generation diagnostic test kit. Serum bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were assayed using standard laboratory techniques. From March 2003 to February 2006, 1,417 patients were admitted for haemodialysis in our unit. Of these 1,077 (76%) had ESKD. Mean age of patients was 42.47 +/- 16.2 (14-94) and 70.39% were males. Patients with ESKD had had more dialysis sessions (10.9 +/- 39.5 vs. 4.4 +/- 5.95, p = 0.009), more blood transfusions and more pre-existing HCV infections (4.72 vs. 1.5%, p = 0.009) than patients with acute renal failure. Of the ESKD patients, 65.7% were discharged, 9.47% died, 1.85% were shifted to chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and 22.46% patients received renal transplantation. Of the patients who received renal transplantation, HCV seroconversion was detected in 2.75%. In the previous study without isolation practices, the HCV seroconversion rate in transplanted patients was 36.2%. The hazard of HCV seroconversion was 0.97 (95% CI 0.93-1.02, p = 0.2) for each additional dialysis and 1.09 (95% CI 0.88-1.36, p = 0.37) for each additional blood transfusion. The study concludes that isolation of HCV-infected patients during haemodialysis significantly decreases the HCV seroconversion rate.",

        "abstract": "Prostate cancer remains a major public health problem and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men in the United States. The present study aims to understand the molecular pathway(s) of prostate cancer which is essential for early detection and treatment. Dorsolateral prostate from 20 week transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice, which spontaneously develops prostate cancer and recapitulates human disease and age-matched non-transgenic littermates were utilized for microarray analysis. Mouse genome network and pathway analyses were mapped to the human genome using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery. In total, 136 differentially expressed genes, including 32 downregulated genes and 104 upregulated genes were identified in the dorsolateral prostate of TRAMP, compared to non-transgenic mice. A subset of differentially expressed genes were validated by qRT-PCR. Alignment with human genome database identified 18 different classes of proteins, among these, 36% were connected to the nucleic acid binding, including ribosomal proteins, which play important role in protein synthesis-the most enriched pathway in the development of prostate cancer. Furthermore, the results suggest deregulation of signaling molecules (9%) and enzyme modulators (8%) affect various pathways. An imbalance in other protein classes, including transporter proteins (7%), hydrolases (6%), oxidoreductases, and cytoskeleton proteins (5%), contribute to cancer progression. Our study evaluated the underlying pathways and its connection to human prostate cancer, which may further help assess the risk of disease development and progression and identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",

Employing semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry we assessed COX-2 expression in samples of pair-matched benign and cancer tissue obtained from the same prostate cancer patient. Mean levels of COX-2 mRNA were 3.4-fold higher in prostate cancer tissue (n = 12) compared with the paired benign tissue. The immunoblot analysis demonstrated that as compared to benign tissue COX-2 protein was over-expressed in 10 of 12 samples examined. Immunohistochemical analysis also verified COX-2 over-expression in cancer than in benign tissue. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo study showing an over-expression of COX-2 in prostate cancer.

        "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a new treatment modality, uses a combination of photosensitizing agent and visible light for the therapy of many solid malignancies. The hallmark of PDT is intracellular oxidative stress mediated by reactive oxygen species, which, through a cascade of events, results in a cell kill that induces apoptosis in some cells. To better understand the mechanism of apoptosis, we hypothesized the role of nitric oxide (NO), which is considered to be involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, during PDT. The model photosensitizer we have been working with is a silicon-phthalocyanine compound termed Pc4. Here, we investigated the involvement of NO during Pc4 PDT in PDT of apoptosis-resistant radiation-induced fibrosarcoma (RIF-1) cells and in PDT of apoptosis-sensitive human epidermoid carcinoma (A431) cells. Pc4 PDT resulted in a rapid increase in nitrite production in A431 cells, starting as early as 15 s post-PDT, and showed a progressive increase up to 15 min post-PDT. This increase in nitrite production was observed in cell lysates as well as in the cell culture medium. RIF-1 cells did not show an increase in nitrite production in either the cell lysates or the culture medium. At this time, a majority of the cells were viable. The Western blot analysis also showed a rapid increase in the expression of the constitutive form of NO synthase as early as 15 s post-PDT when compared to that of the controls. This response showed a dose dependency up to 5 min after Pc4 PDT. This observation was confirmed by a [3H]L-citrulline assay, which also showed a similar pattern for constitutive NO-synthase activity. RIF-1 cells did not show any change in protein expression or enzyme activity after the same treatment. These data, for the first time, demonstrate the generation of NO during PDT and suggest that it may be involved in PDT-mediated apoptosis. This may have relevance in improving the therapeutic efficacy of PDT using pharmacological modulators of NO or NO synthase.",

        "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCA) is the most prevalent cancer diagnosed and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men in the United States. Descriptive epidemiological data suggest that androgens and environmental exposures play a key role in prostatic carcinogenesis. Since androgen action is intimately associated with proliferation and differentiation, at the time of clinical diagnosis in humans most PCA represent themselves as a mixture of androgen-sensitive and androgen-insensitive cells. Androgen-sensitive cells undergo rapid apoptosis upon androgen withdrawal. On the other hand, the androgen-insensitive cells do not undergo apoptosis upon androgen blocking, but maintain the molecular machinery of apoptosis. Thus, agents capable of inhibiting growth and/or inducing apoptosis in both androgen-sensitive and androgen-insensitive cells will be useful for the management of PCA. In the present study, we show that (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenolic constituent present in green tea, imparts antiproliferative effects against both androgen-sensitive and androgen-insensitive human PCA cells, and this effect is mediated by deregulation in cell cycle and induction of apoptosis. EGCG treatment was found to result in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth in both androgen-insensitive DU145 and androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells. In both the cell types, EGCG treatment also resulted in a dose-dependent G(0)/G(1)-phase arrest of the cell cycle as observed by DNA cell-cycle analysis. As evident by DNA ladder assay, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry, the treatment of both DU145 and LNCaP cells with EGCG resulted in a dose-dependent apoptosis. Western blot analysis revealed that EGCG treatment resulted in (i) a dose-dependent increase of p53 in LNCaP cells (carrying wild-type p53), but not in DU145 cells (carrying mutant p53), and (ii) induction of cyclin kinase inhibitor WAF1/p21 in both cell types. These results suggest that EGCG negatively modulates PCA cell growth, by affecting mitogenesis as well as inducing apoptosis, in cell-type-specific manner which may be mediated by WAF1/p21-caused G(0)/G(1)-phase cell-cycle arrest, irrespective of the androgen association or p53 status of the cells.",

        "abstract": "Green tea polyphenols (GTPs) and their major constituent, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), have been reported to demonstrate many interesting biological activities, including anticancer properties. Recent studies on prostate cancer provide strong evidence that epigenetic mechanisms are major players in the regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their binding partner tissue inhibitor of MMPs (TIMPs) involved in prostate cancer progression. Here we demonstrate that GTP/EGCG mediate epigenetic reactivation of TIMP-3 that plays a key role in suppressing invasiveness and cancer progression. Treatment of human prostate cancer DUPRO and LNCaP cells with 10\u2009\u00b5g/mL GTP and 20\u2009\u00b5M EGCG induced TIMP-3 mRNA and protein expression. This transcriptional activation of TIMP-3 was associated with the decrease in the expression of both enhancers of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and its catalytic product trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) repressive marks at the TIMP-3 promoter with an accompanying increase in histone H3K9/18 acetylation. In addition, GTP/EGCG treatment significantly reduced class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity/expression and EZH2 and H3K27me3 levels in prostate cancer cells. EGCG/GTP exposure also reduced MMP-2/MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity and abrogated invasion and migration capabilities in these cells. Silencing of EZH2 and class I HDACs strikingly increased the expression of TIMP-3 independent of DNA methylation. Furthermore, clinical trials performed on patients undergoing prostatectomy consuming 800\u2009mg EGCG (Polyphenon E) up to 6 weeks and grade-matched controls demonstrate an increase in plasma TIMP-3 levels. A marked reduction in class I HDACs activity/expression and EZH2 and H3K27me3 levels were noted in GTP-supplemented prostate tissue. Our findings highlight that TIMP-3 induction, as a key epigenetic event modulated by green tea in restoring the MMP:TIMP balance suppresses prostate cancer progression.",

        "abstract": "The incidence and mortality of pancreatic adenocarcinoma are nearly coincident having a five-year survival of less than 5%. Enormous advances have been made in our knowledge of the molecular alterations commonly present in ductal cancer and other pancreatic malignancies. One significant outcome of these studies is the recognition that common ductal cancers have a distinct molecular fingerprint compared to other nonductal or endocrine tumors. Ductal carcinomas typically show alteration of K-ras, p53, p16INK4, DPC4 and FHIT, while other pancreatic tumor types show different aberrations. Among those tumors arising from the exocrine pancreas, only ampullary cancers have a molecular fingerprint that may involve some of the same genes most frequently altered in common ductal cancers. Significant molecular heterogeneity also exists among pancreatic endocrine tumors. Nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumors have frequent mutations in MEN-1 and may be further subdivided into two clinically relevant subgroups based on the amount of chromosomal alterations. The present review will provide a brief overview of the genetic alterations that have been identified in the various subgroups of pancreatic tumors. These results have important implications for the development of genetic screening tests, early diagnosis, and prognostic genetic markers.",

        "title": "Cyclooxygenase-2 and prostate carcinogenesis.",
        "abstract": "In recent years a dramatic surge has occurred on studies defining to the role of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in causation and prevention of cancer. Prostaglandin (PG) endoperoxidase synthase also commonly referred to as COX is a key enzyme involved in the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGs and other eicosanoids. COX exists as two isoforms, namely COX-1 and COX-2 with distinct tissue distribution and physiological functions. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in many tissues and cell types and is involved in normal cellular physiological functions whereas COX-2 is pro-inflammatory in nature and is inducible by mitogens, cytokines, tumor promoters and growth factors. A large volume of data exists showing that COX-2 is overexpressed in a large number of human cancers and cancer cell lines. The possibility of COX-2 as a candidate player in cancer development and progression evolved from the epidemiological studies which suggest that regular use of aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs could significantly decrease the risk of developing cancers in experimental animals and in humans. In our recently published study (Prostate, 42 2000 73-78), we provided the first evidence that COX-2 is overexpressed in human prostate adenocarcinoma. Many other studies verified our initial observation and reported that compared to normal tissue, COX-2 is overexpressed in human prostate cancer. It should be noted that some recent work has suggested that COX-2 is only up-regulated in proliferative inflammatory atrophy of the prostate, but not in prostate carcinoma. In this scenario, COX-2 inhibitors could afford their effects against prostate carcinogenesis by modulating COX-2 activity in other cells in prostate. An exciting corollary to this ongoing work is that selective COX-2 inhibitors may exhibit chemopreventive and even chemotherapeutic effects against prostate carcinogenesis in humans.",

        "abstract": "Deregulation of beta-catenin signaling is an important event in the genesis of several human malignancies including prostate cancer. We investigated the effects of apigenin, a naturally occurring plant flavone, on prostate carcinogenesis in TRAMP mice and further elucidated its mechanism of action. Oral intake of apigenin by gavage at doses of 20 and 50 microg/mouse/d, 6 days per week for 20 weeks, significantly decreased tumor volumes of the prostate as well as completely abolished distant-site metastases to lymph nodes, lungs, and liver in TRAMP mice. Apigenin-treated mice had significantly diminished weights of their genitourinary apparatuses and dorsolateral and ventral prostate lobes, compared with the control group, and showed reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis in the dorsolateral prostates, which correlated with elevated plasma apigenin levels. Continuous intake of apigenin up to 50 weeks by TRAMP mice significantly improved their overall survival. P.o. administration of apigenin further resulted in increased levels of E-cadherin and decreased levels of nuclear beta-catenin, c-Myc, and cyclin D1 in the dorsolateral prostates of TRAMP mice. Similar effects were noted in TRAMP mice with established tumors. Treatment of DU145 human prostate cancer cells with 10 and 20 micromol/L apigenin also increased protein levels of E-cadherin by 27% to 74%, inhibited nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and its retention in the cytoplasm, and decreased c-Myc and cyclin D1 levels, an effect similar to the exposure of cells to beta-catenin small interfering RNA. Our results indicate that apigenin effectively suppressed prostate carcinogenesis in TRAMP mice, at least in part, by blocking beta-catenin signaling.",

Under these circumstances, chemoprevention seems to be a logical and obvious strategy. Because of its long latency and high incidence, prostate cancer is an ideal disease for chemoprevention. The suitable agent(s) for prostate cancer chemoprevention should be the one(s) that has efficacy in the laboratory experiments on one hand, and also possesses proven epidemiological basis on the other hand. In this article, we address the use of green tea for prostate cancer chemoprevention. Experimental as well as the epidemiological basis for this possibility is provided.",

        "abstract": "We earlier demonstrated that oral infusion of green tea polyphenols inhibits development and progression of prostate cancer in transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. Evidence indi- cates that elevated levels of IGF-I with concomitant lowering of IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-3 are associated with increased risk for prostate cancer development and progression. In this study, we examined the role of IGF/IGFBP-3 signaling and its downstream and other associated events during chemoprevention of prostate cancer by green tea polyphenols in TRAMP mice. Our data demonstrated an increase in the levels of IGF-I, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phosphorylated Akt (Thr-308), and extra- cellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 with concomitant decrease in IGFBP-3 in dorso-lateral prostate of TRAMP mice during the course of cancer progression, i.e., as a function of age. Continuous green tea polyphenol infusion for 24 weeks to these mice resulted in substantial reduction in the levels of IGF-I and significant increase in the levels of IGFBP-3 in the dorso-lateral prostate. This modulation of IGF/IGFBP-3 was found to be associated with an inhibition of protein expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phosphorylated forms of Akt (Thr-308) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. Furthermore, green tea polyphenol infusion resulted in marked inhibition of markers of angiogenesis and metastasis most notably vascular endothelial growth factor, urokinase plasminogen activator, and matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9. Based on our data, we suggest that IGF-I/IGFBP-3 signaling pathway is a prime pathway for green tea polyphenol-mediated inhibition of prostate cancer that limits the progression of cancer through inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis.",

        "abstract": "Epidemiological studies suggest that increased intake of fruits and vegetables may be associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer. Apigenin (4', 5, 7,-trihydroxyflavone), a common dietary flavonoid abundantly present in fruits and vegetables, has shown remarkable anti-proliferative effects against various malignant cell lines. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be elucidated. We investigated the in vivo growth inhibitory effects of apigenin on androgen-sensitive human prostate carcinoma 22Rv1 tumor xenograft subcutaneously implanted in athymic male nude mice. Apigenin was administered to mice by gavage at doses of 20 and 50 mug/mouse/day in 0.2 ml of a vehicle containing 0.5% methyl cellulose and 0.025% Tween 20 in two different protocols. In the first protocol, apigenin was administered for 2 wk before inoculation of tumor and was continued for 8 wk, resulting in significant inhibition of tumor volume by 44 and 59% (P<0.002 and 0.0001), and wet weight of tumor by 41 and 53% (P<0.05), respectively. In the second protocol, administration of apigenin began 2 wk after tumor inoculation and continued for 8 wk; tumor volume and wet weights of tumor were reduced by 39 and 53% (P<0.01 and 0.002) and 31 and 42% (P<0.05), respectively. The tumor inhibitory effect of apigenin was more pronounced in the first protocol of extended treatment, which was associated with increased accumulation of human IGFBP-3 in mouse serum along with significant increase in IGFBP-3 mRNA and protein expression in tumor xenograft. Apigenin intake by these mice also resulted in simultaneous decrease in serum IGF-I levels and induction of apoptosis in tumor xenograft. Importantly, tumor growth inhibition, induction of apoptosis, and accumulation of IGFBP-3 correlated with increasing serum and tumor apigenin levels. In both studies, animals did not exhibit any signs of toxicity or reduced food consumption. In cell culture studies, apigenin treatment resulted in cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis, which correlated with increased accumulation of IGFBP-3 in culture medium and cell lysate. These effects were associated with significant reduction in IGF-I secretion; inhibition of IGF-I-induced cell cycle progression and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) tyrosine phosphorylation, along with an increase in sub-G1 peak by apigenin. Further, treatment of cells with IGFBP-3 antisense oligonucleotide reversed these effects and attenuated apigenin-mediated inhibition of IRS-1 phosphorylation conferring inhibitory effects of apigenin on IGF-signaling. This study presents the first evidence that the in vitro and in vivo growth inhibitory effects of apigenin involve modulation of IGF-axis signaling in prostate cancer.",

        "abstract": "Aberrant nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several human malignancies. In this study, we determined whether NF-kappaB is constitutively activated in human prostate adenocarcinoma, and, if so, whether increased NF-kappaB activation and its binding to DNA influence tumor progression. Using tissue samples obtained during transurethral prostatic resection and paraffin-embedded sections of benign and cancer specimens, we determined the nuclear expression of NF-kappaB/p65 and NF-kappaB/p50, cytoplasmic expression of IkappaBalpha, its phosphorylation, and expression of NF-kappaB-regulated genes, specifically Bcl2, cyclin D1, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). A progressive increase in the expression of NF-kappaB/p65 (but not of p50) was observed in cancer specimens compared to benign tissue, which correlated with increasing levels of IkappaBalpha and its phosphorylation. NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity increased with increasing tumor grade and the binding complex mainly consisted of NF-kappaB/p65-p50 heterodimers. Immunohistochemical analysis showed enhanced nuclear staining for NF-kappaB/p65 in both high-grade (P <.0001) and low-grade (P <.003) cancer specimens, compared to benign tissue. The nuclear levels of NF-kappaB/p65 correlated with concurrent increase in cytosolic levels of IkappaBalpha along with NF-kappaB-dependent expression of Bcl2, cyclin D1, MMP-9, and VEGF. These results demonstrate that NF-kappaB/p65 is constitutively activated in human prostate adenocarcinoma and is related to tumor progression due to transcriptional regulation of NF-kappaB-responsive genes.",

We investigated the role of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway in the invasion of prostate cancer cell lines and activation of this pathway in primary human prostate tumors. Treatment of human prostate cancer cells viz. LNCaP, PC-3 and DU145 with PI3K pharmacological inhibitor, LY294002, potentially suppressed the invasive properties in each of these cell lines. Restoration of the PTEN gene to highly invasive prostate cancer PC-3 cells or expression of a dominant negative version of the PI3K target, Akt also significantly inhibited invasion and downregulated protein expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, markers for cell invasion, indicating a central role of the PI3K-Akt pathway in this process. Immunoblot analysis of PI3K and total/activated levels of Akt showed increased protein levels of catalytic (p110alpha/beta) and regulatory (p85) subunits of PI3K and constitutive Akt activation in high-grade tumors compared to low-grade tumor and benign tissue. Immunohistochemical analyses further confirmed a progressive increase in p-Akt (p-Ser473) levels but not of total-Akt (Akt1/2) in cancer tissues compared to benign specimens. A successive increase in p-Akt expression was further noted in specimens serially obtained from individuals with time-course disease progression. Taken together, these results suggest that aberrant activation of PI3K-Akt pathway may contribute to increased cell invasiveness and facilitate prostate cancer progression.",

        "abstract": "Overexpression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 has been implicated in many pathologic conditions, including cancer. One practical inference of this finding is that sustained inhibition of COX-2 could serve as a promising target for prevention or therapy of cancer. Conventional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and recently developed COX-2-specific inhibitors have shown considerable promise in prevention of some forms of human cancer; however, its application is limited due to severe toxic side effects on normal cells. Therefore, there is a need to define novel, nontoxic dietary constituents with proven chemopreventive effects through other pathways that also possess COX-2 but not COX-1 inhibitory activity. Recent studies on green tea and its major polyphenolic constituent (-)epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) have established its remarkable cancer preventive and some cancer therapeutic effects. Here, we show that EGCG inhibits COX-2 without affecting COX-1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, in androgen-sensitive LNCaP and androgen-insensitive PC-3 human prostate carcinoma cells. Based on our study, it is tempting to suggest that a combination of EGCG with chemotherapeutic drugs could be an improved strategy for prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.",

        "abstract": "We have recently shown that oral consumption of green tea polyphenols inhibits prostate carcinogenesis in transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer and suggested that induction of apoptosis in prostate cancer cells is responsible for these effects. Much of the chemopreventive effects of green tea are attributed to its major polyphenolic constituent (-) epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). In the present study, we report that EGCG-induced apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells is mediated via modulation of two related pathways: (a) stabilization of p53 by phosphorylation on critical serine residues and p14ARF-mediated downregulation of murine double minute 2(MDM2) protein, and (b) negative regulation of NF-B activity, thereby decreasing the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bcl-2. EGCG-induced stabilization of p53 caused an upregulation in its transcriptional activity, thereby resulting in activation of its downstream targets p21/WAF1 and Bax. Thus, EGCG had a concurrent effect on two important transcription factors p53 and NF-B, causing a change in the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 in a manner that favors apoptosis. This altered expression of Bcl-2 family members triggered the activation of initiator capsases 9 and 8 followed by activation of effector caspase 3. Activation of the caspases was followed by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and induction of apoptosis. Taken together, the data indicate that EGCG induces apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma cells by shifting the balance between pro- and antiapoptotic proteins in favor of apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "High-fat diet (HFD) is considered as a major risk factor for benign prostatic diseases and cancer in the Western world. Studies have shown an association between oxidative stress and prostatic diseases. NF-\u03baB has been implicated in stress response and is deregulated in prostrate disorders; therefore, we sought to determine whether HFD could induce oxidative stress in the prostate which could contribute to prostatic diseases.Transgenic NF-\u03baB-Luc-Tag mice were either fed with regular diet (RD) or HFD for 12 weeks. Serial, non-invasive molecular imaging was performed to study NF-\u03baB activation in the whole body, and in various organs including thymus, spleen, and prostate. Western blotting was used to determine the expression of NF-\u03baB, its upstream and downstream targets in the prostate.Twofold increase in whole body NF-\u03baB activity in vivo and two to threefold upregulated prostate NF-\u03baB activity ex vivo were observed after HFD intake compared with RD controls. HFD-induced NF-\u03baB activity was elevated remarkably in the abdominal cavity, thymus, spleen, and prostate with increase in prostrate weight. In the prostrate, an increase in the protein expression of gp91(phox) , p22(phox) , and p47(phox) NADPH oxidase subunits was observed suggesting the involvement of HFD in causing oxidative stress. Nuclear extracts from the prostrate tissue showed an increased expression of p65/RelA that corresponded with elevated cytosolic levels of p-I\u03baB\u03b1, along with increased expression of downstream targets of NF-\u03baB, nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2.Our findings suggest that HFD-mediated oxidative stress and deregulation of NADPH oxidase leads to NF-\u03baB activation in the prostrate.",

        "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a promising new therapeutic modality for the management of a variety of solid malignancies and many non-malignant diseases, is a bimodal therapy using a porphyrin based photosensitizing chemical and visible light. The proper understanding of the mechanism of PDT-mediated cancer cell-kill may result in improving the efficacy of this treatment modality. Earlier we have shown (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA; 95: 6977-6982, 1998) that silicon phthalocyanine (Pc4)-PDT results in an induction of the cyclin kinase inhibitor WAF1/CIP1/p21 which, by inhibiting cyclins (E and D1) and cyclin dependent kinases (cdk2 and cdk6), results in a G0/G1-phase arrest followed by apoptosis in human epidermoid carcinoma cells A431. We have also demonstrated the generation of nitric oxide during PDT-mediated apoptosis (Cancer Res.; 58: 1785-1788, 1998). Retinoblastoma (pRb) and E2F family transcription factors are important proteins, which regulate the G1-->S transition in the cell cycle. Here, we provide evidence for the involvement of pRb-E2F/DP machinery as an important contributor of PDT-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Western blot analysis demonstrated a decrease in the hyper-phosphorylated form of pRb at 3, 6 and 12 h post-PDT with a relative increase in hypo-phosphorylated pRb. Western blot analysis also revealed that PDT-caused decrease in phosphorylation of pRb occurs at serine-780. The ELISA data demonstrated a time dependent accumulation of hypo-phosphorylated pRb by PDT. This response was accompanied with down-regulation in the protein expression of all five E2F (1-5) family transcription factors, and their heterodimeric partners DP1 and DP2. These results suggest that Pc4-PDT of A431 cells results in a down regulation of hyper-phosphorylated pRb protein with a relative increase in hypo-phosphorylated pRb that, in turn, compromises with the availability of free E2F. We suggest that these events result in a stoppage of the cell cycle progression at G1-->S transition thereby leading to a G0/G1 phase arrest and a subsequent apoptotic cell death. These data provide an evidence for the involvement of pRb-E2F/DP machinery in PDT-mediated cell cycle arrest leading to apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "Apigenin, a common dietary flavonoid abundantly present in fruits and vegetables, may have the potential for prevention and therapy for prostate cancer. Here, we report for the first time that apigenin inhibits the growth of androgen-responsive human prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells and provide molecular understanding of this effect. The cell growth inhibition achieved by apigenin treatment resulted in a significant decrease in AR protein expression along with a decrease in intracellular and secreted forms of PSA. These effects were also observed in DHT-stimulated cells. Further, apigenin treatment of LNCaP cells resulted in G1 arrest in cell cycle progression which was associated with a marked decrease in the protein expression of cyclin D1, D2 and E and their activating partner cdk2, 4 and 6 with concomitant induction of WAF1/p21 and KIP1/p27. The induction of WAF1/p21 appears to be transcriptionally upregulated and is p53 dependent. In addition, apigenin inhibited the hyperphosphorylation of the pRb protein in these cells. Apigenin treatment also resulted in induction of apoptosis as determined by DNA fragmentation, PARP cleavage, fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. These effects were found to correlate with a shift in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio more towards apoptosis. Apigenin treatment also resulted in down-modulation of the constitutive expression of NF-kappaB/p65. Taken together, these findings suggest that apigenin has strong potential for development as an agent for prevention against prostate cancer.",

        "abstract": "Development of chemoresistance in androgen-refractory prostate cancer cells is partly due to constitutive activation of Rel/NF-kappaB transcription factors that regulate several cell survival and anti-apoptotic genes. In this study we examined whether betulinic acid (BetA), a pentacyclic triterpene from the bark of white birch, is effective in inhibiting NF-kappaB expression in androgen-refractory human prostate cancer cells exhibiting high constitutive NF-kappaB expression. Treatment of PC-3 cells with BetA inhibited DNA binding and reduced nuclear levels of the NF-kappaB/p65. BetA-mediated NF-kappaB inhibition involved decreased IKK activity and phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha at serine 32/36 followed by its degradation. Reporter assays revealed that NF-kappaB inhibition by BetA is transcriptionally active. These effects were found to correlate with a shift in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and cleavage of poly(ADP)ribose polymerase more towards apoptosis. BetA also inhibited TNFalpha-induced activation of NF-kappaB via the IkappaBalpha pathway, thereby sensitizing the cells to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis. Our studies demonstrate that BetA effectively inhibits constitutive NF-kappaB activation and supports the rationale for targeting NF-kappaB through combination protocols with BetA in androgen-refractory prostate cancer.",

        "abstract": "Epigenetic silencing of gluthathione-S-transferase pi (GSTP1) is recognized as being a molecular hallmark of human prostate cancer. We investigated the effects of green tea polyphenols (GTPs) on GSTP1 re-expression and further elucidated its mechanism of action and long-term safety, compared with nucleoside-analog inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), 5-aza-2'-deoxycitidine. Exposure of human prostate cancer LNCaP cells to 1-10 microg/ml of GTP for 1-7 days caused a concentration- and time-dependent re-expression of GSTP1, which correlated with DNMT1 inhibition. Methyl-specific-PCR and sequencing revealed extensive demethylation in the proximal GSTP1 promoter and regions distal to the transcription factor binding sites. GTP exposure in a time-dependent fashion diminished the mRNA and protein levels of MBD1, MBD4 and MeCP2; HDAC 1-3 and increased the levels of acetylated histone H3 (LysH9/18) and H4. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that cells treated with GTP have reduced MBD2 association with accessible Sp1 binding sites leading to increased binding and transcriptional activation of the GSTP1 gene. Exposure of cells to GTP did not result in global hypomethylation, as demonstrated by methyl-specific PCR for LINE-1 promoter; rather GTP promotes maintenance of genomic integrity. Furthermore, exposure of cells to GTP did not cause activation of the prometaststic gene S100P, a reverse response noted after exposure of cells to 5-aza-2'deoxycitidine. Our results, for the first time, demonstrate that GTP has dual potential to alter DNA methylation and chromatin modeling, the 2 global epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation and their lack of toxicity makes them excellent candidates for the chemoprevention of prostate cancer.",

        "abstract": "Green tea constituent (-) epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has shown remarkable cancer-preventive and some cancer-therapeutic effects. This is partially because of its ability to induce apoptosis in cancer cells without affecting normal cells. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown the involvement of NF-kappa B pathway in EGCG-mediated cell-cycle deregulation and apoptosis of human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells. Here we show the essential role of caspases in EGCG-mediated inhibition of NF-kappa B and its subsequent apoptosis. Treatment of A431 cells with EGCG (10-40 microg/ml) resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of NF-kappa B/p65, induction of DNA breaks, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and morphological changes consistent with apoptosis. EGCG treatment of cells also resulted in significant activation of caspases, as shown by the dose- and time-dependent increase in DEVDase activity, and protein expression of caspase-3, -8 and -9. EGCG-mediated caspase activation induces proteolytic cleavage of NF-kappa B/p65 subunit, leading to the loss of transactivation domains, and driving the cells towards apoptosis. EGCG-mediated induction of apoptosis was significantly blocked by the caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-FMK), and moderately blocked by the specific caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK. Further, pretreatment of cells with Z-VAD-FMK was found to suppress the cleavage of NF-kappa B/p65 subunit, thereby increasing nuclear translocation, DNA binding and transcriptional activity, thus protecting the cells from EGCG-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these studies for the first time demonstrate that EGCG-mediated activation of caspases is critical, at least in part, for inhibition of NF-kappa B and subsequent apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "We have recently shown that oral consumption of green tea polyphenols inhibits prostate carcinogenesis in transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer and suggested that induction of apoptosis in prostate cancer cells is responsible for these effects. Much of the chemopreventive effects of green tea are attributed to its major polyphenolic constituent (-) epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). In the present study, we report that EGCG-induced apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells is mediated via modulation of two related pathways: (a) stabilization of p53 by phosphorylation on critical serine residues and p14ARF-mediated downregulation of murine double minute 2(MDM2) protein, and (b) negative regulation of NF-kappaB activity, thereby decreasing the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bcl-2. EGCG-induced stabilization of p53 caused an upregulation in its transcriptional activity, thereby resulting in activation of its downstream targets p21/WAF1 and Bax. Thus, EGCG had a concurrent effect on two important transcription factors p53 and NF-kappaB, causing a change in the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 in a manner that favors apoptosis. This altered expression of Bcl-2 family members triggered the activation of initiator capsases 9 and 8 followed by activation of effector caspase 3. Activation of the caspases was followed by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and induction of apoptosis. Taken together, the data indicate that EGCG induces apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma cells by shifting the balance between pro- and antiapoptotic proteins in favor of apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy is a promising treatment modality for a variety of cutaneous neoplasms and other skin disorders. Studies suggest an involvement of multiple pathways during photodynamic-therapy-mediated cell death. A complete knowledge of the mechanisms involved in photodynamic therapy may lead to an improvement in its therapeutic efficacy. In vitro as well as in vivo studies have shown the involvement of apoptosis during photodynamic- therapy-mediated cell death. The pathways by which photodynamic therapy causes this are not fully understood. In this study, employing human epidermoid carcinoma (A431) cells and silicon phthalocyanine 4 photodynamic therapy, we show that the cell surface death receptor Fas (also known as APO-1 or CD-95) pathway is an important contributor to photodynamic-therapy-mediated apoptosis. Employ- ing flow cytometric analysis and confocal microscopy we first established that silicon phthalocyanine 4 photodynamic therapy results in a significant induction of apoptosis in A431 cells. Immunoblot analysis revealed a significant time-dependent increase in the protein expression of Fas at 5, 15, 30, and 60 min post-photodynamic therapy followed by a decrease at later time-points (2 and 3 h post-photodynamic therapy). A Fas enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated an increase in this protein in cell culture medium starting at 1 h post-photodynamic therapy and showing a time-dependent response up to 3 h following therapy, suggesting a diffusion of soluble Fas from cells into the medium from 1 h after photodynamic therapy. Silicon phthalocyanine 4 photodynamic therapy also resulted in a time-dependent increase in (i) the multimerization of Fas protein, (ii) the protein expression of Fas ligand, (iii) FADD, an adapter molecule for Fas, and (iv) the binding of FADD with Fas. Silicon phthalocyanine 4 photodynamic therapy also caused a significant activation of FLICE, as evident from the appearance of cleaved products of pro-caspase 8. Further, a pretreatment of cells with rhFas:Fc fusion protein or general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK followed by silicon phthalocyanine 4 photodynamic therapy resulted in a significantly enhanced cell survival. Taken together, our data, for the first time, delineate an involvement of the Fas pathway as an important contributor to photodynamic-therapy-mediated apoptosis of cancer cells. These observations may be important for improving the efficacy of photodynamic therapy for the treatment of skin cancer and possibly other skin disorders. J Invest Dermatol 115:1041-1046 2000",

        "abstract": "Recently, we have shown that ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a rate-controlling enzyme in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway, is overexpressed in prostate cancer (PCA) and prostatic fluid in humans (R. R. Mohan et al., Clin. Cancer Res., 5: 143-147, 1999). ODC is also characterized as an androgen-responsive gene, and the androgenic stimulation regulates the development and growth of both normal and tumorigenic prostate cells. Thus, chemopreventive approaches aimed toward the modulation of ODC could be effective against PCA. Green tea polyphenols (GTPs) possess strong chemopreventive properties against a variety of animal tumor models and in some human epidemiological studies. At least two epidemiological studies have suggested that people who consume tea regularly may have a decreased risk of PCA. In this study, we investigated the effect of GTPs against testosterone-mediated induction of ODC in human prostate carcinoma cells, LNCaP as an in vitro model, and in Cpb:WU rats and C57BL/6 mice as in vivo models. Treatment of LNCaP cells with testosterone resulted in induction of ODC activity in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment of the cells with GTPs resulted in a significant inhibition of testosterone-caused induction of ODC activity in a dose-dependent manner. Similar effects of GTPs were observed in anchorage-independent growth assay of LNCaP cells where pretreatment of the cells with GTP was found to result in dose-dependent inhibition of colony formation. Testosterone treatment of the cells resulted in a significant increase in the level of ODC mRNA, and this increase was almost completely abolished by prior treatment of the cells with GTPs. The administration of testosterone (10 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) to sham-operated and castrated Cpb:WU rats resulted in 2- and 38-fold increases in ODC activity, respectively, in the ventral prostate. Oral feeding of 0.2% GTPs in drinking water for 7 days before testosterone administration resulted in 20 and 54% decreases in testosterone-caused induction of ODC activity in sham-operated and castrated rats, respectively. Similar results were obtained with C57BL/6 mice, where testosterone treatment at similar dosage resulted in a 2-fold increase in ODC activity in the ventral prostate and prior oral feeding with 0.2% GTPs resulted in 40% inhibition in this induction.",

Both PI3K-Akt and Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) are involved in the development and progression of prostate cancer, however, the crosstalk and molecules connecting these pathway remains unclear. A multilevel system representation of the PI3K-Akt and NF-\u03baB pathways was constructed to determine which signaling components contribute to adaptive behavior and coordination. In silico experiments conducted using PI3K-Akt and NF-\u03baB, mathematical models were modularized using biological functionality and were validated using a cell culture system. Our analysis demonstrates that a component representing the I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex can coordinate these two pathways. It is expected that interruption of this molecule could represent a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer.",

        "abstract": "Nutritional factors have been estimated to contribute 20-60% of cancers around the globe, and almost one-third of deaths are being reported in Western countries. According to estimates by the American Cancer Society, during the year 2005 about 232,090 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed alone in the United States and 30,350 men will die of this disease. The high incidence and long latency period of prostate cancer offer plenty of time to pursue strategies toward prevention and/or treatment to suppress or revert this disease. Epidemiological evidence suggests that plant-based dietary agents decrease the risk of some types of human cancer, including prostate cancer. Intake of 400-600 g/day of fruits and vegetables is associated with reduced risk of several cancers. The use of micronutrients and/or other phenolic agents in the diet or synthetic exogenous supplements to prevent neoplastic transformation of normal cells or to slow the progression of established malignant changes in cancer cells is termed \"chemoprevention.\" Considerable attention has been devoted to identify plant-based dietary agents that may serve as natural inhibitors of prostate carcinogenesis. Much progress has been made in the last decade in this area of investigation through identification of pathways that play important roles in prostate tumorigenesis. This article summarizes epidemiological, clinical, and mechanistic studies and the significance of plant-derived dietary agents such as flavonoids, indoles, isothiocyanates, phenolics, monoterpenes, and complementary and alternative agents in the management of prostate cancer with recommendations for future studies to advance this area of research.",

        "abstract": "Development of chemotherapy resistance and evasion from apoptosis in osteosarcoma, a primary malignant bone tumor, is often correlated with constitutive nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. Here, we investigated the ability of a polyphenolic fraction of green tea (GTP) that has been shown to have antitumor effects on various malignant cell lines to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in human osteosarcoma SAOS-2 cells. Treatment of SAOS-2 cells with GTP (20-60 microg/ml) resulted in reduced cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis, which correlated with decreased nuclear DNA binding of NF-kappaB/p65 and lowering of NF-kappaB/p65 and p50 levels in the cytoplasm and nucleus. GTP treatment of cells reduced IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation but had no effect on its protein expression. Furthermore, GTP treatment resulted in the inhibition of IKK-alpha and IKK-beta, the upstream kinases that phosphorylate IkappaB-alpha. The increase in apoptosis in SAOS-2 cells was accompanied with decrease in the protein expression of Bcl-2 and concomitant increase in the levels of Bax. GTP treatment of SAOS-2 cells also resulted in significant activation of caspases as was evident by increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-8 in these cells. Treatment of SAOS-2 cells with a specific caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-CHO (Ac-DEVD-CHO) and general caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-FMK) rescued SAOS-2 cells from GTP-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results indicate that GTP is a candidate therapeutic for osteosarcoma that mediates its antiproliferative and apoptotic effects via activation of caspases and inhibition of NF-kappaB.",

        "abstract": "Identification of common dietary substances capable of affording protection or modulating the onset and severity of arthritis may have important human health implications. An antioxidant-rich polyphenolic fraction isolated from green tea (green tea polyphenols, GTPs) has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties in experimental animals. In this study we determined the effect of oral consumption of GTP on collagen-induced arthritis in mice. In three independent experiments mice given GTP in water exhibited significantly reduced incidence of arthritis (33% to 50%) as compared with mice not given GTP in water (84% to 100%). The arthritis index also was significantly lower in GTP-fed animals. Western blot analysis showed a marked reduction in the expression of inflammatory mediators such as cyclooxygenase 2, IFN-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor alpha in arthritic joints of GTP-fed mice. Histologic and immunohistochemical analysis of the arthritic joints in GTP-fed mice demonstrated only marginal joint infiltration by IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha-producing cells as opposed to massive cellular infiltration and fully developed pannus in arthritic joints of non-GTP-fed mice. The neutral endopeptidase activity was approximately 7-fold higher in arthritic joints of non-GTP-fed mice in comparison to nonarthritic joints of unimmunized mice whereas it was only 2-fold higher in the arthritic joints of GTP-fed mice. Additionally, total IgG and type II collagen-specific IgG levels were lower in serum and arthritic joints of GTP-fed mice. Taken together our studies suggest that a polyphenolic fraction from green tea that is rich in antioxidants may be useful in the prevention of onset and severity of arthritis.",

        "abstract": "Epidemiologic studies suggest that populations that consume large amounts of dietary fat are at greater risk for prostate carcinoma. Arachidonic acid and its precursor, linoleic acid, are major ingredients of animal fats and many vegetable oils that are used in the regions where prostate carcinoma is prevalent. The metabolism of arachidonic acid by either the cyclooxygenase pathway or the lipoxygenase pathway generates eicosanoids, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of human diseases, including cancer, and are now believed to play important roles in tumor promotion, progression, and metastasis. Studying these pathways in specimens from patients with prostate carcinoma, the authors recently demonstrated the overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 in prostate adenocarcinoma. In the current study, the authors report the overexpression of lipoxygenase-5 (5-LO) in samples from patients with prostate adenocarcinoma.Employing 22 pair-matched benign and malignant tissue samples that were obtained from the same patients with prostate carcinoma, the expression of 5-LO was determined using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry and by measuring the levels of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) by radioimmunoassay.The mean level of 5-LO mRNA was six-fold greater (P < 0.001) in malignant tissue compared with benign tissue. The immunoblot analysis demonstrated that, compared with benign tissue, 5-LO protein was overexpressed in 16 of 22 samples examined and was 2.6 fold greater (P < 0.001) in malignant tissue. Immunohistochemical studies further verified 5-LO up-regulation in malignant tissue that was not present in benign tissue. The levels of 5-HETE, which is a metabolic product of arachidonic acid, was found to be 2.2-fold greater (P < 0.001) in malignant tumor tissue compared with benign tissue.To the authors' knowledge, this is the first in vivo study showing overexpression of 5-LO in patients with prostate carcinoma. This study suggests that inhibitors of arachidonic acid pathway in general and selective 5-LO inhibitors in particular may be useful for prevention or therapy in patients with prostate carcinoma.",

        "title": "Chemoprevention of prostate carcinogenesis by alpha-difluoromethylornithine in TRAMP mice.",
        "abstract": "Development of effective chemopreventive agents for human consumption requires conclusive evidence of their efficacy in animal models that have relevance to human diseases. Transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate (TRAMP) is an excellent model of prostate cancer that mimics progressive forms of human disease inasmuch as 100% of males develop histological PIN by 8-12 weeks of age that progress to adenocarcinoma with distant site metastases by 24-28 weeks of age. In these animals, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity (>3-fold) as well as protein expression (>4-fold) was found to be markedly higher in the dorsolateral prostate as compared with the nontransgenic littermates, suggesting their suitability to determine the chemopreventive effect of alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitor of ODC, against prostate cancer. Using male TRAMP mice, we studied the effect of oral consumption of DFMO on development of prostate carcinogenesis and surrogate end point biomarkers related to prostate cancer progression. In two independent experiments, each consisting of 8 animals on test, the cumulative incidence of prostatic cancer development at 28 weeks of age in 16 untreated TRAMP mice was 100% (16 of 16), whereas 94% (15 of 16) and 69% (11 of 16) of the animals exhibited distant site metastases to lymph nodes and lungs, respectively. Oral consumption of 1% DFMO (w/v) in the drinking water to TRAMP mice from 8 to 28 weeks of age resulted in a significant decrease in (a) weight (59%) and volume (66%) of prostate, (b) genitourinary weight (63%), and (c) ODC enzyme activity (52%) in the dorsolateral prostate. Importantly, in none of the DFMO-fed TRAMP mice were any distant metastases to lymph node and lungs observed. Furthermore, DFMO treatment resulted in the marked reduction in the protein expression of proliferation cell nuclear antigen, ODC, and probasin in the dorsolateral prostate. The protein expression of antimetastases markers, i.e., E-cadherin and alpha- and beta-catenin, was found to be restored in DFMO-fed animals as compared with the non-DFMO-fed mice. These chemopreventive effects of DFMO were further confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis of the dorsolateral prostate. Histological analysis of the dorsolateral prostate of DFMO-fed animals displayed marginal epithelial stratification, a small number of cribriform structures, elongated hyperchromatic epithelial nuclei, and a significant increase in apoptotic index. Non-DFMO-fed animals, on the other hand, displayed extensive epithelial stratification with profound cribriform structures accompanied with marked thickening, remodeling, and hypercellularity of the fibromuscular stroma. In nontransgenic littermates fed with DFMO, no significant alterations in the above parameters were evident. These data demonstrate that ODC represents a promising and rational target for chemoprevention of human prostate cancer and that TRAMP mice are excellent models for screening of novel drugs and chemopreventive regimens for potential human use.",

        "abstract": "Apigenin, a plant flavone, potentially activates wild-type p53 and induces apoptosis in cancer cells. We conducted detailed studies to understand its mechanism of action. Exposure of human prostate cancer 22Rv1 cells, harboring wild-type p53, to growth-suppressive concentrations (10-80 microM) of apigenin resulted in the stabilization of p53 by phosphorylation on critical serine sites, p14ARF-mediated downregulation of MDM2 protein, inhibition of NF-kappaB/p65 transcriptional activity, and induction of p21/WAF-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Apigenin at these doses resulted in ROS generation, which was accompanied by rapid glutathione depletion, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytosolic release of cytochrome c, and apoptosis. Interestingly, we observed accumulation of a p53 fraction to the mitochondria, which was rapid and occurred between 1 and 3 h after apigenin treatment. All these effects were significantly blocked by pretreatment of cells with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, p53 inhibitor pifithrin-alpha, and enzyme catalase. Apigenin-mediated p53 activation and apoptosis were further attenuated by p53 antisense oligonucleotide treatment. Exposure of cells to apigenin led to a decrease in the levels of Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 and increase in Bax, triggering caspase activation. Treatment with the caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-FMK and DEVD-CHO partially rescued these cells from apigenin-induced apoptosis. In vivo, apigenin administration demonstrated p53-mediated induction of apoptosis in 22Rv1 tumors. These results indicate that apigenin-induced apoptosis in 22Rv1 cells is initiated by a ROS-dependent disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential through transcriptional-dependent and -independent p53 pathways.",

        "abstract": "Deregulation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I/IGF-IR signaling has been implicated in the development and progression of prostate cancer. Agents that can suppress the mitogenic activity of the IGF/IGF-IR growth axis may be of preventive or therapeutic value. We have previously demonstrated that apigenin, a plant flavone, modulates IGF signaling through upregulation of IGFBP-3. In this study, we investigated the mechanism(s) of apigenin action on the IGF/IGF-IR signaling pathway. Exposure of human prostate cancer DU145 cells to apigenin markedly reduced IGF-I-stimulated cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Apigenin inhibited IGF-I-induced activation of IGF-IR and Akt in DU145 cells. Similar growth inhibitory and apoptotic responses were observed in PC-3 cells, which constitutively overexpress this pathway. This effect of apigenin appears to be due partially to reduced autophosphorylation of IGF-IR. Inhibition of p-Akt by apigenin resulted in decreased phosphorylation of GSK-3beta along with decreased expression of cyclin D1 and increased expression of p27/kip1. In vivo administration of apigenin to PC-3 tumor xenografts inhibited tumor growth, resulted in IGF-IR inactivation and dephosphorylation of Akt and its downstream signaling. These results suggest that inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis by apigenin are mediated, at least in part, by its ability to inhibit IGF/IGF-IR signaling and the PI3K/Akt pathway.",

A wide range of compounds, both synthetic and naturally occurring has been shown to possess cancer chemopreventive effects in murine skin carcinogenesis models. Only a limited number of these agents have been tested for their efficacy in the human population. Here, we provide a brief review on the skin cancer chemopreventive potential and mechanism of action of various synthetic and natural agents. Many of these agents are present in daily diet and are supplemented or topically applied against prevention of various stages of skin cancer. We will also discuss the current status and future prospects of these agents for development as promising chemopreventive agents against skin cancer.",

        "abstract": "Development of effective agents for treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer has become a national medical priority. We have reported recently that apigenin (4',5,7-trihydroxyflavone), found in many common fruits and vegetables, has shown remarkable effects in inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis in many human prostate carcinoma cells. Here we demonstrate the molecular mechanism of inhibitory action of apigenin on androgen-refractory human prostate carcinoma DU145 cells that have mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 and pRb. Treatment of cells with apigenin resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of growth, colony formation, and G1 phase arrest of the cell cycle. This effect was associated with a marked decrease in the protein expression of cyclin D1, D2, and E and their activating partner, cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)2, 4, and 6, with concomitant upregulation of WAF1/p21, KIP1/p27, INK4a/p16, and INK4c/p18. The induction of WAF1/p21 and its growth inhibitory effects by apigenin appears to be independent of p53 and pRb status of these cells. Apigenin treatment also resulted in alteration in Bax/Bcl2 ratio in favor of apoptosis, which was associated with the release of cytochrome c and induction of apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1). This effect was found to result in a significant increase in cleaved fragments of caspase-9, -3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Further, apigenin treatment resulted in downmodulation of the constitutive expression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)/p65 and NF-kappaB/p50 in the nuclear fraction that correlated with an increase in the expression of IkappaB-alpha (IkappaBalpha) in the cytosol. Taken together, we concluded that molecular mechanisms during apigenin-mediated growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in DU145 cells was due to (1) modulation in cell-cycle machinery, (2) disruption of mitochondrial function, and (3) NF-kappaB inhibition.",

These are important strategies, but sadly these efforts are only partially effective. Thus, the development of novel strategies to reduce the occurrence of skin cancer is a highly desirable goal. One attractive approach is through chemoprevention which is the use of naturally occurring agents or synthetic compounds to prevent the occurrence and subsequent development of cancer. The ideal chemopreventive agent(s) for use for prevention of skin cancer must be available in its active form with none or minimal toxicity and a known mechanism of action. A wide range of synthetic and naturally occurring agents have been identified as a rich source of skin cancer chemopreventive agents. For a variety of reasons, there is a greater emphasis on the use of naturally occurring compounds for skin cancer chemoprevention, and many such agents have found a place in skin care products. This review focuses on the use of naturally occurring agents present in the diet and beverages consumed by humans for the chemoprevention of skin cancer.",

TRF treatment to PrEC and PZ-HPV-7 resulted in almost identical growth-inhibitory responses of low magnitude. In sharp contrast, TRF treatment resulted in significant decreases in cell viability and colony formation in all three prostate cancer cell lines. The IC 50 values after 24 h TRF treatment in LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145 cells were in the order 16.5, 17.5, and 22.0 \u03bcg/ml. TRF treatment resulted in significant apoptosis in all the cell lines as evident from (i) DNA fragmentation, (ii) fluorescence microscopy, and (iii) cell death detection ELISA, whereas the PrEC and PZ-HPV-7 cells did not undergo apoptosis, but showed modestly decreased cell viability only at a high dose of 80 \u03bcg/ml. In cell cycle analysis, TRF (10\u201340 \u03bcg/ml) resulted in a dose-dependent G0/G1 phase arrest and sub G1 accumulation in all three cancer cell lines but not in PZ-HPV-7 cells. These results suggest that the palm oil derivative TRF is capable of selectively inhibiting cellular proliferation and accelerating apoptotic events in prostate cancer cells. TRF offers significant promise as a chemopreventive and/or therapeutic agent against prostate cancer. Keywords Prostate cancer Cancer chemoprevention Tocotrienol-rich fraction Palm oil Cell cycle arrest Apoptosis An effective chemoprevention strategy relies on agents that can selectively eliminate proliferating cells via programmed cell death and spare quiescent or terminally differentiated cells [1,2] . Cancer chemoprevention has emerged as an important means of cancer control by using dietary agents or synthetic compounds that are capable of blocking neoplastic inception or delaying disease progression [1\u20135] . Research indicates that this strategy is promising with respect to reducing the incidence of cancer in well-defined high-risk groups and in the general population [6,7] . In recent years considerable attention has been focused on the role of nutrients as chemopreventive agents. The concept of using micronutrients for the chemoprevention of cancer is based on evidence obtained from human epidemiologic studies, clinical trials, and studies of the cancer inhibiting potential of these agents on animal carcinogenesis models [8] . Basic research has identified a number of nutrients, some of which inhibit mutagenesis or hyper-proliferation, and others that induce apoptosis or differentiation as critical characteristics of chemoprevention, regardless of their specific molecular targets [8\u201310] . Prostate cancer, because of its prolonged latency and high incidence, is an ideal target for the development of chemo-protective agents that could effectively reduce the incidence of this disease [9,10] . Use of naturally occurring compounds for chemoprevention, ones that are present in dietary sources, is considered to be a practical approach for the prevention of prostate cancer. Vitamin E, a fat soluble vitamin, is well known for its cellular antioxidant and lipid lowering properties [11\u201313] . The term vitamin-E has traditionally been applied to alpha (\u03b1)-tocopherol. It is now been increasingly accepted as a generic term for tocotrienols and tocopherols. Although both classes of compounds share the same aromatic chromanol \u2018head,\u2019 the two isoforms of vitamin E differ in their side chains. Tocopherols possess saturated phytyl side-chain while tocotrienols have an unsaturated isoprenoid chain along their \u201ctails.\u201d Both tocopherols and tocotrienols exist in four isomeric forms: alpha (\u03b1), beta (\u03b2), gamma (\u03b3), and delta (\u03b4). Each of these isomeric forms can be distinguished by the differing locations of methyl groups on their aromatic rings ( Fig. 1 ). Accumulating evidence has suggested that tocotrienols possess cancer chemopreventive properties [14,15] . Tocotrienols extracted from crude palm oil consist mainly of a mixture of \u03b1-, \u03b3-, and \u03b4-tocotrienols and some \u03b1-tocopherols, referred to as tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF). Tocotrienols have been shown to possess anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, and anti-proliferative properties [16,17] . Tocotrienol-rich fraction from palm oil has been shown to inhibit proliferation and growth of human breast cancer cells [18,19] . Studies from our group have shown that TRF activates p53, modulates Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and induces apoptosis in human colon cancer cells [20] . More recent studies have shown that \u03b3-tocotrienols inhibits cell proliferation by decreasing Akt and activation of NF-\u03baB, implicated in the regulation of cell growth, cell cycle, and apoptosis [21] . Dietary intake of palm oil, in contrast to other high-fat diets, suppressed carcinogen-induced mammary tumorigenesis in experimental animals [22\u201325] . Dietary supplementation of TRF has been shown to inhibit growth of estrogen-receptor positive human breast cancer MCF-7 cells in athymic nude mice [26] . Furthermore, stripping of tocotrienols from palm oil promoted mammary carcinogenesis, evidence supporting the anti-cancer attributes of tocotrienols [27] . At present information concerning the effects of TRF in prostate cancer is limited. This study provides the first evidence that TRF imparts differential anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects in human prostate cancer cells versus normal cells. Materials and methods Cell lines. Androgen-responsive human prostate cancer cells, LNCaP (originally obtained from metastatic prostate cancer in a supraclavicular lymph node), androgen-refractory PC-3 (originally obtained from metastatic prostate cancer in bone), and DU145 (originally obtained from metastatic prostate cancer in brain), belonging to different metastatic sites, and virally transformed PZ-HPV-7 cells, derived from normal tissue of the peripheral zone of the prostate and immortalized by transfection with HPV 18 virus, were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Normal human prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) were purchased from Clonetics and were propagated in the recommended medium. The LNCaP cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin\u2013streptomycin cocktail; DU145 and PC3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 media with 5% FBS and 1% penicillin\u2013streptomycin cocktail (Cellgro, Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . The PZ-HPV-7 cells were cultured in keratinocyte serum-free medium supplemented with 5 ng/ml human recombinant EGF and 0.05 mg/ml bovine pituitary extract (Gibco). Tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) of palm oil. TRF was kindly provided by Abdul Gapor, Malaysian Palm Oil Board, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The composition of TRF is as follows: \u03b1-tocotrienol 14.77%, \u03b3-tocotrienol 33.97%, \u03b4-tocotrienol 26.11%, \u03b1-tocopherol 18.10%, and other \u03b3-tocopherol, and tocotrienol-like compounds 7.05%, respectively. Proliferation assay. The effect of TRF on the viability of cells was determined by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide) assay. Briefly, the cells were plated at 1 \u00d7 10 4 cells per well in 200 \u03bcl of complete culture medium containing 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 \u03bcg/ml concentrations of TRF in 96-well microtiter plates. TRF stock solutions were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 100 \u03bcg/ml concentration and mixed with fresh medium to achieve the desired final concentration. Each concentration of TRF was repeated in ten wells. After incubation at 24 h at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified incubator, cell viability was determined. Fifty microliters MTT (5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline stock, diluted to working strength 1 mg/ml with media) was added to each well and incubated for 2 h after which the plate was centrifuged at 600 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. The MTT solution was removed from the wells by aspiration. After careful removal of the medium, 0.1 ml of buffered DMSO was added to each well and plates were shaken. The absorbance was recorded on a microplate reader at the wavelength of 540 nm. The effect of TRF on growth inhibition was assessed as percent cell viability where vehicle-treated cells were taken as 100% viable. Colony formation assay. For anchorage-independent cell growth, soft agar colony formation assay was performed in a six-well plate (Costar-Corning Incorporated, New York). Each well contained 2 ml of 0.5% agar in medium as the bottom layer, 1 ml of 0.38% soft agar (Sigma) in medium, and \u223c2000 cells at the feeder layer treated with various concentrations of TRF (5\u201320 \u03bcg/ml in medium). Cultures were maintained at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO 2 atmosphere. The number of colonies were determined after 2 weeks by counting them under an inverted phase-contrast microscope at 400\u00d7 magnification and a group of \u223c20 cells were counted as a colony. Cell cycle analysis. Asynchronized (70\u201380%) confluent cells were treated with 10, 20, and 40 \u03bcg/ml TRF for 24 h. After treatment cells were collected, washed twice with chilled PBS, and spun in a cold centrifuge at 600 g for 10 min. The pellet was fixed by re-suspending in 50 \u03bcl PBS and 450 \u03bcl chilled methanol for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. The cells were washed twice with PBS at 600 g for 5 min and again suspended in 500 \u03bcl PBS, and incubated with 5 \u03bcl RNAse (20 \u03bcg/ml final concentration) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. The cells were chilled over ice for 10 min, stained with propidium iodide (50 \u03bcg/ml final concentration) for 1 h, analyzed by flow cytometry, and evaluated using Cell Quest & ModFit cell cycle analysis software. DNA fragmentation assay. Fragmentation of chromatin to units of single or multiple nucleosomes that form the nucleosomal DNA ladder in agarose gel is an established hallmark of programmed cell death or apoptosis [28] . Briefly, the cells were grown to about 70% confluence and treated with 20 \u03bcg/ml TRF for 48 h. Following these treatments, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 0.5% Triton X-100), left on ice for 15 min, and pelleted by centrifugation (14,000 g ) at 4 \u00b0C. The pellet was incubated with DNA lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) for 30 min on ice and then centrifuged at 14,000 g at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant obtained was incubated overnight with RNAse (0.2 mg/ml) at room temperature and then with Proteinase K (0.1 mg/ml) for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. DNA was extracted using phenol:chloroform (1:1) and precipitated with 95% ethanol for 2 h at \u221280 \u00b0C. The DNA precipitate was centrifuged at 14,000 g at 4 \u00b0C for 15 min and the pellet was air-dried and dissolved in 20 \u03bcl of Tris\u2013EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mM EDTA). Total amount of DNA was resolved over 1.5% agarose gel, containing 0.3 mg/ml ethidium bromide in 1\u00d7 TBE buffer (89 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 89 mM boric acid, and 2 mM EDTA) (BioWittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD).The bands were visualized under UV transilluminator followed by digital photography. Cell death detection assay. Following TRF treatment, the extent of apoptosis was determined by Cell Death Detection ELISA PLUS assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, the cells were harvested after TRF treatment at 10, and 20 \u03bcg/ml dose for 24 h, and incubated on ice for 30 min in Tris lysis buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaF, 0.5% NP-40, and 1% Triton X-100) containing fresh protease inhibitors (5 \u03bcg/mL aprotinin, 10 \u03bcg /mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 \u03bcg/ml sodium vanadate), and then centrifuged at 14,000 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The total cell lysate was used for protein determination by the DC Bio-Rad \u00ae protein assay. The lysate (30 \u03bcg of total protein) was added to lysis buffer and pipetted on a streptavidin-coated 96-well microtiter plate to which immunoreagent mix was added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with continuous shaking at 600 g . The wells were then washed with washing buffer, the substrate solution added, and the color developed (10\u201320 min) was read at 405-nm against the blank, reference wavelength of 490-nm. The enrichment factor (total amount of apoptosis) was calculated by dividing the absorbance of the sample ( A 405 nm ) by the absorbance of the controls without treatment ( A 490 nm ). Detection of apoptosis by fluorescence microscopy. Cells grown in eight chambered slides (Nunc-Labtek, Nunc, Naperville, IL) and were treated with 10 and 20 \u03bcg/ml for 24 h TRF. After 24 h cells were washed with PBS and processed for apoptosis detection by using Cytokeratin 18 (CK18) monoclonal antibody, which is an early marker for apoptosis. The fluorescence analysis was performed under the BX51 Olympus microscope by using M 30 Assay Kit (Roche Applied Sciences, Mannheim, Germany) according to vendor\u2019s protocol. Statistical analysis. The values are expressed as means \u00b1 SE. The significance between the control and treated groups was performed by Student\u2019s t test and p values less than 0.05 were taken as significant in all the experiments. Results and discussion Tocotrienols are the primary form of vitamin E, a biologic agent that is commonly present in the seed endosperm of most monocots and certain dicots, including wheat, rice and barley. The highest fraction of tocotrienols is found in crude palm oil, in concentration of up to 800 mg/kg; this is known as the tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) [29,30] . The anti-cancer properties of TRF are currently under investigation [31] . Tocotrienols are believed to block or delay the malignant progression of transformed cells by modulating cell proliferation or differentiation [32,33] . These cytostatic effects could be attained by the ingestion of tocotrienols in the diet of healthy individuals who are at increased risk of developing prostate cancer. Cytostatic effects may also be beneficial by limiting the possibility of developing drug resistance and drug-induced toxicity. Therefore, we studied whether TRF has potential to slow the proliferation rate and eliminate prostate cancer cells via programmed cell death. In this study, we evaluated the growth-inhibitory effects of TRF in normal human prostate epithelial PrEC cells, virally transformed normal human prostate epithelial PZ-HPV-7 cells and human prostate carcinoma cells viz. LNCaP (androgen-responsive), DU145 (androgen-refractory), and PC-3 (androgen-refractory) cells, representing various stages in the biological spectrum of prostate cancer. We first assessed the effect of TRF on the viability of PrEC and PZ-HPV-7 cells. Exposure of PrEC cells to TRF resulted in a slight decrease in cell viability at the highest concentration of 80 \u03bcg/ml (data not shown). Exposure of PZ-HPV-7 cells to TRF showed similar findings, with a modest decrease in cell viability at the highest concentration of TRF exposure. In sharp contrast, all three cancer cell lines tested were more sensitive to TRF-mediated loss of viability, which occurred at lower doses and was much more pronounced than in the PrEC and PZ-HPV-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 2 A, treatment of LNCaP cells with 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80-\u03bcg/ml concentrations of TRF for 24 h, resulted in 28.6%, 45.6%, 63.7%, 86.2%, and 87.8% inhibition of cell growth, compared to vehicle treated control. Exposure of DU145 cells to TRF resulted in 17.9%, 20.1%, 46.5%, 78.3%, and 79.8% inhibition of cell growth whereas PC-3 cells exhibited 18.5%, 43.3%, 54.5%, 85.8%, and 86.8% cell growth inhibition, respectively, after TRF exposure. Treatment of prostate cancer cells to 20 \u03bcg/ml concentration of TRF also resulted in time-dependent inhibition of cell growth in all three cell types and the effect was more pronounced at 48 h post-treatment ( Fig. 2 B). A modest time-dependent cell growth-inhibitory effect was observed in PZ-HPV-7 cells after TRF exposure. The IC 50 value of TRF was estimated to be 16.5, 17.5, and 22.0 \u03bcg/ml for LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145 cells, respectively; however, for PZ-HPV-7 cells the value appears to be >80 \u03bcg/ml. These observations suggest that prostate cancer cells respond differentially to TRF exposure than their normal counterparts. We next investigated the effect of TRF on anchorage-independent growth by soft agar colony formation. Anchorage-independent growth is one of the hallmarks of malignancy, and is considered to be a direct in vitro assay for detection of malignant transformation of cells [34] . Tumor cells attain this capability via a series of genetic and epigenetic alterations. As shown in Fig. 2 compared with vehicle treated controls (22 colonies/field), exposure of LNCaP cells to TRF resulted in a significant decrease in anchorage-independent growth and colony formation to 11, 5, and 2 colonies/field at 5, 10, and 20 \u03bcg/ml concentration. In DU145 cells, TRF exposure at 5, 10, and 20 \u03bcg/ml concentrations resulted in 14, 12, and 7 colonies/field compared to the 35 colonies/field that were observed in vehicle treated controls. Similar observations were noted in PC-3 cells in which exposure to TRF resulted in 24, 16, and 8 colonies/field compared to the 44 colonies/field observed in vehicle treated control ( Fig. 3 ). To establish a broad spectrum anticancer activity of TRF, we next evaluated the anti-proliferative effects on various human cancer cell lines viz. HeLa (cervical adenocarcinoma), MCF-7 (breast carcinoma), RKO (colon carcinoma), and HT1080 (fibrosarcoma) cells. TRF exposure at 20 \u03bcg/ml for 24 h resulted in 21.3% inhibition in HeLa cells, 30.2% inhibition in MCF-7 cells, 24.4% inhibition in RKO cells, and 17.1% inhibition in HT1080 cells, which was more pronounced at 72 h of TRF treatment (data not shown). These results suggest that TRF possess a broad spectrum anti-proliferative potential and its response is not limited to specific cell type. Manipulation of a number of biological pathways can be exploited for chemoprevention. Apoptosis is a physiological process for the elimination of redundant or damaged cells [35,36] . Apoptosis induction is arguably the most potent defense against cancer progression as most of the current-used chemotherapeutic drugs inhibit cancer cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis [37,38] . Unfortunately, chemotherapeutic agents are not designed to selectively target cancer cells. Consequently, chemotherapeutic agents typically damage normal cells, an adverse effect that hampers this therapeutic modality. Therefore, agents capable of preferentially eliminating cancer cells without affecting normal cells offer the safest modality for cancer treatment. We next investigated whether TRF-mediated loss of cell viability in human prostate cancer cells viz. LNCaP, DU145, PC-3, and PZ-HPV-7 cells is a consequence of apoptosis. We first evaluated the induction of apoptosis by TRF via classical DNA ladder assay. Compared to vehicle treated controls, exposure of LNCaP, DU145, and PC-3 cells to 20 \u03bcg/ml TRF for 48 h resulted in induction of apoptosis, as evidenced by the formation of internucleosomal DNA fragments ( Fig. 4 A). Importantly, it was noted that TRF exposure did not result in the formation of a DNA ladder in PZ-HPV-7 cells, exhibiting a selective dose\u2013response effect compared to prostate cancer cells ( Fig. 4 B). Similar effects were observed with PrEC cells (data not shown). To quantitate and further support the finding that TRF exposure causes apoptosis in cancer cells we performed cell death detection by ELISA. Compared to vehicle treated controls, exposure of LNCaP cells to TRF at 10, and 20 \u03bcg/ml concentrations resulted in 4.5- and 5.8-fold increases in induction of apoptosis. In DU145 cells, 3.9- and 5.1-fold increases in apoptosis induction were noted; and in PC-3 cells, 4.2- and 5.5-fold increases in apoptosis induction were noted at 10, and 20 \u03bcg/ml concentrations of TRF exposure, compared to vehicle treated controls ( Fig. 4 B). To further investigate the induction of apoptosis by TRF, fluorescence microscopy was employed after labeling the cells with M30 CytoDEATH, an antibody that binds to a caspase-cleaved epitope of the cytokeratin 18 cytoskeletal protein and functions as a marker for apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 4 C, 20 \u03bcg/ml of TRF exposure resulted in apoptosis in all three prostate cancer cell lines. In contrast, no apoptotic morphology was observed in PZ-HPV-7 cells, after 20 \u03bcg/ml TRF concentration (data not shown). In recent years, many chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive agents have been shown to impart anti-proliferative effects via arrest of cell division at certain checkpoints in the cell cycle [39,40] . The concept of \u2018cell cycle-mediated apoptosis\u2019 has gained increasing attention as this pathway may provide minimal opportunity for acquired drug resistance, decreased mutagenesis, and reduced toxicity [41] . Furthermore, there is increasing interest in identifying natural dietary agents capable of selective/preferential elimination of cancer cells by influencing cell cycle regulation and/or causing apoptosis [8,10] . We evaluated the possibility that TRF influences the cell cycle in various prostate cancer cell lines. Compared to vehicle treated controls, TRF resulted in an appreciable arrest of cancer cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle after 24 h of exposure. The exposure caused an arrest of 74.1% cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle at a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml,, an effect that further increased to 77.2% at a concentration of 20 \u03bcg/ml and 75.3% at the highest exposure of 40 \u03bcg/ml in LNCaP cells. Similar observations were recorded in DU145 and PC-3 cell lines: exposure of these cells to TRF concentrations of 10, 20, and 40 \u03bcg/ml resulted in 56.9%, 61.4%, and 68.2% arrest in the G0/G1 phase in DU145 cells and 51.7%, 59.4%, and 62.5% arrest in PC-3 cells, respectively ( Fig. 5 ). These increases in the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase were accompanied with a concomitant decrease of cell populations in the S-phase and G2-M phases of the cell cycle in all three cell lines. In addition, cell exposure to TRF significantly increased the sub G1 accumulation of cells in a dose-dependent manner in the order LNCaP > PC-3 > DU145, a finding that is considered to be a hallmark of apoptotic cell death. This analysis provided additional evidence that exposure of prostate cancer cells to TRF resulted in dose-dependent apoptosis, which is consistent with the fluorescent microscopy data ( Fig. 4 C). Prostate cancer, because it is highly prevalent and is presumed to have a long latency period between its induction and the development of clinically evident disease, is viewed as an excellent candidate for cancer chemopreventive strategies [9,10] . Numerous epidemiologic studies have provided a basis for the development cancer chemoprevention protocols using bio-active dietary agents capable of eliminating pre-malignant or malignant cells. The results of this study suggest that TRF has the potential to affect the steady state cell population and thus may be a good candidate for development as a chemopreventive and/or therapeutic agent against prostate cancer. To our knowledge this is the first report showing the selective effects of tocotrienol-rich fraction of palm oil in causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells without affecting normal cells. However, more detailed studies are required to determine the exact mechanism(s) of action of TRF, specifically evaluating its effects on epigenetic and signal transduction pathways. Based on previous investigations, the p53 and Akt/NF-\u03baB signaling pathways may be involved in TRF-mediated cell cycle perturbations and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Further studies are needed to verify our data and to evaluate the effectiveness of TRF in pre-clinical models of prostate cancer. Acknowledgments The authors thank Mr. A.

        "abstract": "The incidence and mortality of pancreatic adenocarcinoma are nearly coincident having a five-year survival of less than 5%. Enormous advances have been made in our knowledge of the molecular alterations commonly present in ductal cancer and other pancreatic malignancies. One significant outcome of these studies is the recognition that common ductal cancers have a distinct molecular fingerprint compared to other nonductal or endocrine tumors. Ductal carcinomas typically show alteration of K-ras, p53, p16INK4, DPC4 and FHIT, while other pancreatic tumor types show different aberrations. Among those tumors arising from the exocrine pancreas, only ampullary cancers have a molecular fingerprint that may involve some of the same genes most frequently altered in common ductal cancers. Significant molecular heterogeneity also exists among pancreatic endocrine tumors. Nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumors have frequent mutations in MEN-1 and may be further subdivided into two clinically relevant subgroups based on the amount of chromosomal alterations. The present review will provide a brief overview of the genetic alterations that have been identified in the various subgroups of pancreatic tumors. These results have important implications for the development of genetic screening tests, early diagnosis, and prognostic genetic markers.",

        "abstract": "Development of androgen independence and resistance to apoptosis in prostate cancer are often correlated with high levels of serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in these patients. The loss of sensitivity to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in androgen-insensitive prostate carcinoma cells is due in part to constitutive activation of Rel/nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB transcription factors that regulate several cell survival and antiapoptotic genes. Our previous studies have demonstrated growth inhibitory and apoptotic effects of apigenin, a common plant flavonoid, in a variety of human prostate carcinoma cells. Here we examined whether apigenin is effective in inhibiting NF-kappaB expression in androgen-insensitive human prostate carcinoma cells exhibiting high constitutive levels of NF-kappaB.Using androgen-insensitive human prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells, the effect of apigenin was assessed on NF-kappaB activation by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and reporter gene assay. Expression of NF-kappaB subunits p65 and p50, IkappaBalpha, p-IkappaBalpha, in-beads kinase assay and NF-kappaB-regulated genes were determined by Western blot analysis. Apoptosis was determined by annexin V/propidium iodide staining after fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis.Treatment of cells with 10-40- micro M doses of apigenin inhibited DNA binding and reduced nuclear levels of the p65 and p50 subunits of NF-kappaB. Apigenin inhibited IkappaBalpha degradation and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and significantly decreased IKKalpha kinase activity. Apigenin also inhibited TNF-alpha-induced activation of NF-kappaB via the IkappaBalpha pathway, thereby sensitizing the cells to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. The inhibition of NF-kappaB activation correlated with a decreased expression of NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene and suppressed expression of NF-kappaB-regulated genes [specifically, Bcl2, cyclin D1, cyclooxygenase-2, matrix metalloproteinase 9, nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS-2), and vascular endothelial growth factor].Our results indicate that inhibition of NF-kappaB by apigenin may lead to prostate cancer suppression by transcriptional repression of NF-kappaB-responsive genes as well as selective sensitization of prostate carcinoma cells to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "Aberrant Nuclear Factor-\u03baappaB (NF-\u03baB) activation due to rapid I\u03baB\u03b1 turnover and high basal I\u03baB\u03b1 kinase (IKK) activity has been frequently observed in prostate cancer. Apigenin, a naturally occurring plant flavone, exhibits anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic activities by inhibiting NF-\u03baB pathway, through a mechanism not fully understood. We found that apigenin feeding in microgram doses (bioavailable in humans) inhibited prostate tumorigenesis in TRAMP mice by interfering with NF-\u03baB signaling. Apigenin feeding to TRAMP mice (20 and 50 \u03bcg/mouse/day, 6 days/week for 20 weeks) exhibited significant decrease in tumor volumes of the prostate and completely abolished metastasis, which correlated with inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation and binding to the DNA. Apigenin intake blocked phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 by inhibiting IKK activation, which in turn led to suppression of NF-\u03baB activation. The expression of NF-\u03baB-regulated gene products involved in proliferation (cyclin D1, and COX-2), anti-apoptosis (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL), and angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor) were also downregulated after apigenin feeding. These events correlated with the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells, as evident by increased cleaved caspase-3 labeling index in the dorsolateral prostate. Our results provide convincing evidence that apigenin inhibits IKK activation and restores the expression of I\u03baB\u03b1, preventing it's phosphorylation in a fashion similar to that elicited by IKK and proteasomal inhibitors through suppression of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.",

FoxO3a and Klotho are stimulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to increased oxidative stress. Klotho, an antiaging gene, modulates stress-induced senescence, and decreases with advancing age, whereas forkhead transcription factor, FoxO3a is known to involve in a paradigm that engages in antioxidant, anti-proliferative and tumor suppressor functions. We have previously demonstrated that FoxO3a is deregulated in human prostate adenocarcinoma and in transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model that mimics progressive forms of human disease. Here we demonstrate the anticancer effects of rhamnetin, a dietary flavonoid present in fruits and vegetables, in modulating Klotho and FoxO3a signaling by suppressing ROS. Per-oral feeding of rhamnetin at 10- and 20-\u03bcg/mouse/day (gavaged in 0.2 ml vehicle containing 0.5% methyl cellulose and 0.025% Tween 20) to TRAMP mice for six days per week for 16 weeks, starting at 8 weeks of age, exhibited marked reduction in tumor growth with no signs of metastasis. Rhamnetin feeding to TRAMP resulted in a significant dose-dependent reduction in FoxO3a, in the dorso-lateral prostates. FoxO3a protein was redistributed more in nuclear than the cytosolic compartments after rhamnetin feeding. Simultaneously, decreased FoxO3a phosphorylation (Ser-253) was observed in the dorso-lateral prostate, which correlated with decreased cytoplasmic retention of FoxO3a with no significant changes in 14-3-3 chaperone protein in the cytosol after rhamnetin feeding. Additionally, decreased IGF-1 protein expression with subsequent decrease in p-Akt (Ser-473) and p-Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) was observed after rhamnetin feeding demonstrating that the decreased nuclear presence of p-Akt (Ser-473) may restrict FoxO3a phosphorylation and its retention in the nucleus along with decreased p-Erk1/2 levels in the dorso-lateral prostate. Furthermore, rhamnetin intake led to increased levels of SOD2 and significantly enhanced the expression of the thioredoxin/peroxiredoxin (Trx/Prx) in the dorso-lateral prostate. Similar findings were recorded in cell culture studies where rhamnetin treatment to human prostate cancer LNCaP and PC-3 cells resulted in the restoration of Klotho and FoxO3a in the nucleus. This increase in Klotho and FoxO3a protein expressions in the nucleus may be a decisive factor for increase resistance to oxidative stress and cancer progression. Our finding suggests that rhamnetin has potential to modulate Klotho and FoxO signaling cascades and could be represented as therapeutic targets in prostate cancer.Citation Format: Christine Oak, Natarajan Bhaskaran, Sanjay Gupta, Sanjeev Shukla.

        "abstract": "Acquisition of metastatic capability during prostate cancer progression leads to clinically incurable malignancy and accounts for the majority of deaths from this disease. Metastasis involves multiple processes, including invasion, intravasation, extravasation and tumor growth at the secondary site. Maspin, a unique member of the serpin (serine protease inhibitor) family, shown to regulate cell motility, invasion and contributes in tumor metastasis. Loss of maspin has been frequently identified in clinical prostate cancer specimens and prostate cancer cell lines, therefore novel therapeutic approaches to restore its expression are needed. Apigenin (4\u2032, 5, 7-trihydroxyflavone), a plant flavone has shown to possess anticancer properties and alters pathways that regulate tumor cell invasion and metastasis, however molecular basis of these effects remains unclear. We demonstrate that apigenin enhances maspin expression in human prostate cancer cells through upregulation of p53 activity and downregulation of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. Treatment of human prostate cancer LNCaP cells (harboring wild type p53) with 1-40 \u03bcM apigenin for 72 h resulted in dose- and time- dependent decrease in cell invasion and migration with concurrent increase in maspin expression and increased its nuclear localization. Apigenin treatment also resulted in the inhibition of HDAC enzyme activity, increase in H3 and H4 acetylation and p53 activation, similar with the use of Class I HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A. In human prostate cancer DU145 cells, harboring mutant p53, apigenin treatment resulted in an increase in maspin expression which correlated with upregulation of wild-type p53 activity, conversely trichostatin A was unable to upregulate maspin expression. Transfection of DU145 cells with maspin reporter plasmid increased the activity of maspin promoter, consistent with the results. In another approach, endogenous levels of mapsin was restored after transfection of cells with wild type p53 in prostate cancer PC-3 cells (p53 null), which was further increased by apigenin treatment. Furthermore, knockdown of HDAC1 did not affect maspin levels in human prostate cancer LNCaP and DU145 cell lines suggesting that HDAC1 inhibition does not play a role in maspin regulation, whereas it appears that apigenin-dependent global modulation of HDAC activity resulted in decreased cell invasion and proliferation. Taken together, our findings suggest that apigenin-mediated increase in maspin expression is regulated, in part, by p53 and its activation resulting in decreased invasiveness and migration capabilities of prostate cancer cells.

        "abstract": "Enzalutamide is a second-generation nonsteroidal antiandrogen clinically approved for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), yet resistance to endocrine therapy has limited its success in this setting. Although the androgen receptor (AR) has been associated with therapy failure, the mechanisms underlying this failure have not been elucidated. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and its interaction with AR play a major role in acquisition of enzalutamide resistance. To validate the finding, we show upregulation of \u03b2-catenin and AR in enzalutamide-resistant cells, partially due to reduction of \u03b2-TrCP mediated-ubiquitination. While activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway in enzalutamide-sensitive cells led to drug resistance, combination of \u03b2-catenin inhibitor ICG001 with enzalutamide inhibited expression of stem-like markers, cell proliferation, and tumor growth synergistically in various models. Analysis of clinical datasets revealed a molecule pattern shift in different stages of PCa, where we detected a significant correlation between AR and \u03b2-catenin expression. These data identify activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway as a major mechanism contributing to enzalutamide resistance and demonstrate the potential to stratify patients with high risk of said resistance.",

        "abstract": "The role of CD133 (Prominin-1) as a cancer stem cell marker may be useful for therapeutic approaches and prognostication in prostate cancer patients. We investigated the stem-cell-related function and biological features of a subpopulation of CD133+ cells isolated from established primary human prostate cancer cell lines. The CD133+ cells sorted from human prostate cancer 22Rv1 exhibited high clonogenic and tumorigenic capabilities, sphere forming capacity and serially reinitiated transplantable tumors in NOD-SCID mice. Gene profiling analysis of CD133+ cells showed upregulation of markers of stem cell differentiation (CD44, Oct4, SOX9 and Nanog), epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (c-myc and BMI1), osteoblastic differentiation (Runx2), and skeletal morphogenesis (BMP2), compared to side population of CD133-cells. These cells are highly malignant and resistant to \u03b3-radiation and chemotherapeutic drug, docetaxel. Importantly, a docetaxel-resistant subclone was more enriched in CD133+ cells with significant increase in Runx2 expression, compared to CD133-cells. Furthermore, knockdown of Runx2 in these cells resulted in differential response to chemotherapy, sensitizing them to increased cell death. These results demonstrate therapy-resistant population with stem-like features are distinct subpopulation of malignant cells that resides within parental cell lines. The molecular signature of CD133+ cells may lead to identification of novel therapeutic targets and prognostic markers in the treatment of prostate cancer.",

        "abstract": "Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are phase II detoxifying enzymes involved in the maintenance of cell integrity, oxidative stress and protection against DNA damage by catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione to a wide variety of electrophilic substrates. Though enzymes of the glutathione synthesis and salvage pathways have been well characterized in the past, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding of their independent and coordinate regulatory mechanisms in carcinogenesis. The present review discusses implication of GST in cancer development and progression, gene polymorphism, drug resistance, signaling and epigenetic regulation involving their role in cancer. It is anticipated that GST especially the GSTP1 class can be developed as a biomarker either used alone or in combination with other biomarkers for early cancer detection and/or diagnosis as well as for future targeted preventive and therapeutic interventions with dietary agents.",

        "abstract": "Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is the later stage of prostate cancer (PCa) when the disease has stopped responding to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). It has been established that androgen receptor (AR) re-activation is responsible for the recurrence of PCa after ADT. Thus targeting different pathways that regulate AR stability and activity should be a promising strategy for treatment of CRPC. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are chaperones that modify stability and activity of their client proteins. HSP90, a major player of the HSP family, regulates stabilities of many proteins, including AR and Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a critical regulator of many cell cycle events. Further, HSP90 is overexpressed in different cancers, including PCa. Herein, we show that co-treatment of PCa with AR antagonist enzalutamide and HSP90 inhibitor leads to more severe cell death due to a synergistic reduction of AR protein. Interestingly, we show that overexpression of Plk1 rescued the synergistic effect and that co-targeting HSP90 and Plk1 also leads to more severe cell death. Mechanistically, we show that E3 ligase CHIP, in addition to targeting AR, is responsible for the degradation of Plk1 as well. These findings suggest that co-targeting HSP90 and some of its client proteins may be a useful strategy in treatment of CRPC.",

        "abstract": "Methylation of DNA and histone protein is an epigenetic modification mediated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone methyltransferases (HMTs) critically involved in methylation and regulation of affinity binding between the histones and DNA backbone. HMTs catalyze the transfer of one, two, or three methyl groups to lysine and arginine residues of histone proteins. The HMTs-mediated increase in histone affinity to DNA causes chromatin condensation, preventing transcription; whereas DNMTs methylate cytosine residues within gene promoters resulting in transcriptional repression. DNMT and HMT activities are reported to be associated with signal transduction, cell growth and death, as well as with the pathogenesis of various human diseases including cancer. Dietary plant flavones can affect epigenetic modifications accumulated over time and have shown health-beneficial effects. However, the epigenetic response on DNMT and HMT elicited by plant flavones has not been elucidated. Through in silico protein-ligand docking studies and molecular studies with plant flavones viz. chrysin, apigenin and luteolin and their effect on DNA and histone methylation was assessed. The ligands were individually docked into the pocket of DNMT and EZH2 using Glide in XP (extra precision) mode (Schrodinger, LLC). Binding of ligands with proteins were evaluated using GlideScore, which is an empirically derived scoring function. Virtual screening approach using the model of the catalytic site of DNMT and EZH2 demonstrated that plant flavones tethered at both ends inside the catalytic pocket of DNMT and EZH2 by means of hydrogen bonding. Flavones exhibited a high docking rank (Glide score) in the order of chrysin (-5.8), apigenin (-6.4), luteolin (-7.4) compared with the pharmacological inhibitor, 5-Aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (-4.2). Notably, all three flavones inhibited EZH2, having a high docking rank compared to the known pharmacological inhibitor, 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep). The docking rank for chrysin was -10.07, apigenin -9.73 and luteolin -11.23, compared to -7.62 for DZNep. Epigenetic studies performed with plant flavones demonstrated reversal of hypermethylation of cytosine bases in the DNA and prevented methylation of cytosine in the GC-rich promoter sequence incubated with MSsI enzyme. Furthermore, decrease protein expression of EZH2 and trimethylation of H3K27 was noted in prostate cancer cells treated with these plant flavones. Taken together, our results suggest that plant flavone can alter DNMT and HMT activities and methylation of DNA and histone proteins that regulate epigenetic modifications providing significant health-effects and prevent various pathological processes involved in the development of cancer.

Phytochemicals present therein provide beneficial anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that serve to improve the cellular microenvironment. Compounds known as flavonoids categorized anthocyanidins, flavonols, flavanones, flavonols, flavones, and isoflavones have shown considerable promise as chemopreventive agents. Apigenin (4', 5, 7-trihydroxyflavone), a major plant flavone, possessing antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties affecting several molecular and cellular targets used to treat various human diseases. Epidemiologic and case-control studies have suggested apigenin reduces the risk of certain cancers. Studies demonstrate that apigenin retain potent therapeutic properties alone and/or increases the efficacy of several chemotherapeutic drugs in combination on a variety of human cancers. Apigenin's anticancer effects could also be due to its differential effects in causing minimal toxicity to normal cells with delayed plasma clearance and slow decomposition in liver increasing the systemic bioavailability in pharmacokinetic studies. Here we discuss the anticancer role of apigenin highlighting its potential activity as a chemopreventive and therapeutic agent. We also highlight the current caveats that preclude apigenin for its use in the human trials.",

        "abstract": "Defects in p53 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathways are frequently observed in the initiation and development of various human malignancies, including prostate cancer. Clinical studies demonstrate higher expression of NF-\u03baB/p65/RelA, NF-\u03baB/p50/RelB, and cRel as well as downregulation of the p53 network in primary prostate cancer specimens and in metastatic tumors. Betulinic acid (BA), is a triterpenoid that has been reported to be an effective inducer of apoptosis through modification of several signaling pathways. Our objective was to investigate the pathways involved in BA-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells. We employed the androgen-responsive LNCaP cells harboring wild-type p53, and androgen-refractory DU145 cells possessing mutated p53 with high constitutive NF-\u03baB activity. Inhibition of cell survival by BA at 10 and 20 \u00b5M concentrations occurred as a result of alteration in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in both cell lines that led to an increased cytochrome C release, caspase activation and poly(ADP)ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, leading to apoptosis. BA treatment resulted in stabilization of p53 through increase in phosphorylation at Ser15 in LNCaP cells, but not in DU145 cells, and induction of cyclin kinase inhibitor p21/Waf1 in both cell types. Furthermore, treatment of both prostate cancer cells with BA decreased the phosphorylation of I\u03baB kinase (IKK)\u03b1 and I-kappa-B-alpha (I\u03baB\u03b1) inhibiting the nuclear location of NF-\u03baB/p65 causing cytosolic accumulation and resulting in its decreased nuclear binding. We demonstrate that BA may induce apoptosis by stabilizing p53 and downregulating NF-\u03baB pathway in human prostate cancer cells, irrespective of the androgen association, and therefore can potentially be developed as a molecule of interest in cancer chemoprevention.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer, development of metastases remains a major clinical challenge. Maspin (SERPINB5), a unique member of the serpin (serine protease inhibitor) family, is a secreted protein encoded by a class II tumor suppressor gene, shown to regulate cell motility, invasion and regulates tumor metastasis. Loss of maspin has been frequently identified in clinical prostate cancer specimens and prostate cancer cell lines, therefore mechanistic understanding of its loss will provide new perspectives to develop novel therapeutics. METHODS: Maspin expression was examined in human prostate cancer specimens of various Gleason grades, and in various human prostate cancer cell lines. Preparation of class I histone deacetylase (HDAC 1, 2, 3 and 8) knockout was achieved by infecting human prostate cancer LNCaP cells with shV and shHDAC1-8 in PLK0.1 plasmids. Human prostate cancer cells were treated with various doses of HDAC inhibitors in timeand dose-dependent manner. Migration assays were performed along with expression of maspin, and class I HDACs activity was determined by immunoblotting and ELISA assay. Immunoprecipitation and ChIP was performed in LNCaP and HDAC silenced cells to study the association between maspin and p53. RESULTS: Studies performed on benign and prostate cancer specimens demonstrate progressive loss of maspin expression which correlated with increasing Gleason score. Maspin promoter methylation and deletion analysis on tissue specimens did not contribute to the loss of maspin. Treatment of human prostate cancer DU145 and LNCaP cells with sodium butyrate and trichostatin A, inhibitors of HDACs, resulted in marked increase in maspin expression and acetylation of H3/ H4 histone proteins, as a consequence of downregulation of Class I HDACs. Individual knockdown of HDAC 1, 2, 3 and 8 in LNCaP cells caused an increase in maspin expression which was more pronounced in HDAC 1, 3 and 8 knockdown cells followed by increase in p53 expression. HDAC 1-8 knockout cells exhibited slow migration ability, compared to LNCaPshV cells. ChIP assay further confirmed silencing of class I HDACs in LNCaP cells facilitated the association between maspin and p53. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that loss of maspin is due to upregulation of class I HDACs and HDAC inhibitors led to increase in maspin expression and activity, in part, mediated by p53 activation in prostate cancer.",

Plant-derived natural bioactive compounds (phytochemicals) have acquired an important role in human diet as potent antioxidants and cancer chemopreventive agents. In past few decades, the role of epigenetic alterations such as DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs in the regulation of mammalian genome have been comprehensively addressed. Although the effects of dietary phytochemicals on gene expression and signaling pathways have been widely studied in cancer, the impact of these dietary compounds on mammalian epigenome is rapidly emerging. The present review outlines the role of different epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation and maintenance of mammalian genome and focuses on the role of dietary phytochemicals as epigenetic modifiers in cancer. Above all, the review focuses on summarizing the progress made thus far in cancer chemoprevention with dietary phytochemicals, the heightened interest and challenges in the future.",

        "abstract": "The ability of prostate cancer cells to alter their metabolism in a manner distinct from benign cells and energy reprogramming is a major concern in treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). On the other hand, development of resistance to next-generation drugs directed against the AR signaling axis (Abiraterone acetate and Enzalutamide) confers a grim prognosis. Hence, targeting aerobic glycolysis of tumor cells as well as AR signaling axis in CRPC is highly desirable. Here, we report the role of a dual-action miRNA which targets the Androgen Receptor function as well as action of key factors involved in tumor energy metabolism. In addition, the miRNA also targets the key anti-apoptotic factors and enhance the apoptosis in cultured cells. Furthermore, together with Enzalutamide, the miRNA shows a potent synergistic anti-tumor activity in 22RV1 mouse xenografts. We will present the detailed results showing the therapeutic potential of dual-action miRNA in the treatment of CRPC.

        "abstract": "Green tea polyphenols (GTPs) and its major constituent (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) reactivate epigenetically silenced genes in cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1), an enzyme involved in detoxification process, is frequently inactivated in prostate cancer due to epigenetic modifications. The mechanisms underlying the re-expression of GSTP1 expression by GTP/EGCG in prostate cancer is currently not well understood. Earlier we demonstrated the ability of GTP/EGCG to increase p53 transcriptional activity through suppression of class I histone deacetylases (Carcinogenesis 33(2):377-84, 2012). Here we report that the GSTP1 gene is an unrecognized downstream transcriptional target of the tumor suppressor p53, and that GTP/EGCG has ability to increase GSTP1 expression mediated through p53. Treatment of human prostate cancer LNCaP cells with 5\u03bcg/ml GTP and 20\u03bcM EGCG, activate p53 through acetylation at the Lys373 and Lys382 residues along with consequent increase in GSTP1 protein expression in time-dependent manner. To study the possible interaction between GSTP1 and p53, LNCaP cells stably-transfected with short hairpin-RNA against p53 (LNCaPshp53) and control vector (LNCaPshV) for generation of p53 knockout cells. GTP/EGCG treatment induced p53 activation and acetylation at p53 Lys373 and Lys382 specifically in LNCaPshV cells in time-dependent manner, but not in LNCaPshp53. This increase in p53 acetylation led to activation of GSTP1 in LNCaPshV cells both at protein and message levels. GTP/EGCG-mediated increase in GSTP1 expression is caused by increase binding of p53 to its consensus binding site on the intron 4 of GSTP1 gene as analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift binding assay. Furthermore, this association was validated by ChIP assay where GTP/EGCG treatment led to an increase in the amount of acetylated p53-Lys373 associated within the intron site of GSTP1, compared to untreated controls. Taken together, our findings indicate the ability of p53 to transcriptionally activate the human GSTP1 gene, which defines a novel mechanism of protection of the genome by green tea polyphenols.

        "abstract": "Metastasis is responsible for more than 90% of prostate cancer-associated mortality in the United States. Metastasis is facilitated by remodeling of the extracellular matrix by a family of proteolytic enzymes known as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). These zinc-dependent proteases elicit pivotal role in the proteolytic degradation of structural components of extracellular matrix contributing to the metastatic process. High levels of MMP-2/9 in the plasma and urine has been correlated with metastasis. MMPs are produced in a latent form (pro-MMP) that require activation and are inhibited by tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs). TIMPs inhibit MMPs by binding in a 1:1 stoichiometry through strong noncovalent interactions. In prostate cancer, low levels of TIMP3 has been associated with aggressive tumor phenotype and poor disease-free survival. Loss of TIMP3 in prostate cancer is attributed to epigenetic silencing tipping the balance towards active MMPs driving metastasis. Green tea polyphenols (GTP) and its major constituent, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has been shown to suppress prostate cancer metastasis, however the mechanism has not been fully elucidated. We determined whether treatment with GTP/EGCG has ability to restore induction of TIMP3 and play a key role in suppressing invasiveness in prostate cancer. Treatment of prostate cancer LNCaP and DUPRO cells with 10\u03bcg/mL GTP and 20\u03bcM EGCG for 72 h significantly induced TIMP3 mRNA and protein levels. Silencing of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) significantly increased the expression of TIMP3 which was independent of DNA hypermethylation. Treatment of prostate cancer cells with GTP/EGCG significantly reduced EZH2 and class I HDAC protein levels; H3K27 trimethylation activity; and transcriptional activation of TIMP-3 was found to be associated with decreased EZH2 localization and H3K27 trimethylation enrichment at the TIMP3 promoter with a concomitant increase in histone H3K9/18 acetylation. EGCG/GTP treatment also caused a global reduction in histone methylation thereby increasing histone acetylation to revive and activate TIMP3 levels. Furthermore, EGCG/GTP exposure significantly reduced MMP2/9 gelatinolytic activity and abrogated invasive and migration capabilities in prostate cancer cells. Taken together, our findings suggests that TIMP-3 induction could be a key epigenetic event modulated by GTPs in restoring MMP: TIMP balance to delay prostate cancer invasion and metastasis.

We have previously shown that AMPK\u03b1 activity is significantly inhibited by Ser-485/491 phosphorylation in cell culture and in vivo models of metastatic and castration-resistant prostate cancer. To determine potential translatability, we investigated AMPK\u03b1-Ser-485/491 phosphorylation status in clinical prostate cancer specimens and its correlation with metastasis and progression to castration-resistance. Metastasis and matched primary tumor specimens from 45 metastatic prostate cancer patients, 31.1% of which were post-androgen deprivation therapy failure (castration-resistant prostate cancer), and primary tumor specimens from 30 non-metastatic, hormone-dependent prostate cancer patients with undetectable PSA for a mean of 97.1 \u00b1 17.5 months were obtained from the University Hospitals Case Medical Center Pathology Archive.

In this study we incorporated stability into four feature selection methods for identifying the most robust and discriminating features for two prostate histopathology classification tasks. We evaluated 242 morphology features from N\u2009=\u2009212 prostatectomy specimens from four sites for automated cancer detection and grading. We quantified instability as the rate of significant cross-site feature differences. We mapped feature stability and discriminability using 188 non-cancerous and 210 cancerous regions via 3-fold cross validation, then held one site out, creating independent training and testing sets. In training, one feature set was selected only for discriminability, another for discriminability and stability. We trained a classifier with each feature set, testing on the hold out site. Experiments were repeated with 117 Gleason grade 3 and 112 grade 4 regions. Stability was calculated across non-cancerous regions. Gland shape features yielded the best stability and area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) trade-off while co-occurrence texture features were generally unstable. Our stability-informed method produced a cancer detection AUC of 0.98\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05 and increased average Gleason grading AUC by 4.38%. Color normalization of the images tended to exacerbate feature instability.",

        "abstract": "e16559Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is 1.7 times more prevalent and 2.3 times more lethal in African American (AA) men than in Caucasian American (CA) men. Additionally there is a higher incidence (when controlling for relative population size) of more aggressive PCa in the AA compared to the CA population which has led a number of groups to investigate whether there are molecular differences in the disease phenotype between the two groups. In this work we investigate whether computer extracted features of glandular morphology from digitized pathology images of surgical specimens identified as predictive of biochemical recurrence are also differentially expressed between AA and CA patients. Methods: Two cohorts were gathered. Cohort 1 (C1) contained digitized whole mount Gleason 7 radical prostatectomy specimens (RPS) from 72 patients (46 CA, 26 AA). Cohort 2 (C2) comprising quarter and whole mount RPS from 145 patients (135 CA, 10 AA), who either had biochemical recurrence in 5 years (47) or did not ...",

        "abstract": "Clinical management decisions in prostate cancer are often based on risk determination with major uncertainty since limited tools are available to understand the risk of disease progression and guide the treatment decision process. Computer-aided quantitative histomorphometric analysis has emerged as a powerful computing tool to identify, characterize, and quantitate histologic features of tissues beyond human visual capabilities. Several quantitative features can be assessed, such as precise numeric measurements pertaining to the spatial arrangement and architecture of nuclei, shapes of nests and nuclei, and nuclear texture. This technology has proven to be useful for the detection of cancer in tissue sections and also for predicting tumor biology and clinical outcome in cancer patients. Utilizing a combination of synergistic strategy of quantitative histomorphometry and biomarker expression of NF-\u03baB/p65 from prostate tissue specimens, we sought to fuse structural and functional information from morphological and molecular markers to better characterize disease progression improving prediction of biochemical recurrence (BCR). Here we utilized radical prostatectomy specimens (n=23) for feature extraction from 15 patients without BCR and 8 patients who experienced BCR (PSA u003e 0.2 ng/ml) within two years of surgery.

        "abstract": "High-Fat Diet (HFD) has emerged as an important risk factor not only for obesity and diabetes but also for urological disorders. Recent research provides ample evidence that HFD is a putative cause for prostatic diseases including prostate cancer. The mechanisms whereby these diseases develop in the prostate have not been fully elucidated. In this review we discuss signaling pathways intricately involved in HFD-induced prostate disease. We performed a search through PUBMED using key words \"high fat diet\" and \"prostate\". Our data and perspectives are included in this review along with research performed by various other groups. HFD is positively associated with an increased risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer. HFD induces oxidative stress and inflammation in the prostate gland, and these adverse influences transform it from a normal to a diseased state. Studies demonstrate that HFD accelerates the generation of reactive oxygen species by driving the NADPH oxidase system, exacerbating oxidative stress in the prostate. HFD also causes a significant increase in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and gene products through activation of two important signaling pathways: the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT)-3 and Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB). Both these pathways function as transcription factors required for regulating genes involved in proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, invasion and inflammation. The crosstalk between these two pathways enhances their regulatory function. Through its influences on the NF-\u03baB and Stat-3 signaling pathways, it appears likely that HFD increases the risk of development of BPH and prostate cancer.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Although various novel tissue engineered urethral scaffolds have been reported in the last decade, less reports are focused on the multi-scale structure of scaffold. Therefore, the structure of those scaffolds are quite different from the actual urethral tissue. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of constructing the 3D multi-scale modified bulbar urethral scaffold, which can be similar to the native urethral structure. METHODS: Five volunteers\u2019 images about their bulbar urethra were obtained through the ultrasound. Those data were used to reform the 3D digital model of bulbar urethra. By using the indirect 3D printing technique, the mould of individual bulbar urethra was constructed. The silk fibroin solution was cast into this mould and freeze-dry procedure was performed, subsequently. After forming the macro porous scaffold, the Acetobacter xylinum was incubated into the scaffold to assemble the cellulose layer. The mechanical tests were perform in all scaffolds. The details of final scaffold were evaluated by the micro CT and scanning electron microscope. Meanwhile, the details of native bulbar urethral structure was compared with those in the constructed scaffold. RESULTS: All scaffold exhibited the ideal mechanical properties. The gross view of the constructed scaffolds was similar to the actual bulbar urethra. In the micro-scale, a typical bilayer structure could be noticed in the scaffold. The pore size of scaffold inner surface was 12.3 2.4mm, which is close to the native urethra (15.2 3.6mm). The pore size of scaffold sublayer and native urethra were 140 34mm and 146 30mm, respectively. In the nano-scale, no statistical difference of fiber diameter was found in the constructed scaffold and native urethra (22.3 6.3 nm vs 24.6 5.0 nm). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the feasibility of constructing individual 3D urethral scaffold, which was similar to the structure of native bulbar urethra in multi-scale. Furthermore, the structure of this scaffold could be easily modified by controlling the production process according to the demanding of design. It provide a novel conception for constructing the tissue engineering urethral scaffold.",

        "title": "Obesity-initiated metabolic syndrome promotes urinary voiding dysfunction in a mouse model",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVEAccumulating evidences suggests that obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) contribute towards lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) through alterations in the phenotype of bladder and prostate gland. Clinical studies indicate a link between MetS and LUTS. Nevertheless, there is lack of suitable animal model(s) which could illustrate an association linking obesity to LUTS. We examined the lower urinary tract function in an obesity-initiated MetS mouse model.METHODSMale C57BL/6N wild-type and obese B6.V-Lepob/J maintained on regular diet for 28\u2009weeks were subjected to the assessment of body weight (BW), body length (BL), waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI), blood glucose (BG), plasma insulin (INS), plasma leptin (LEP), total cholesterol (CHO), free fatty acid (FFA), and measurement of urinary functions. Whole animal peritoneal and subcutaneous adipose tissue measurements as well as prostate and bladder volumes were analyzed by MRI followed by histological evaluation. These parameters were used to draw correlations between MetS and LUTS.RESULTSObesity parameters such as BW, WC, and BMI were significantly higher in B6.V-Lepob/J mice compared to C57BL/6N mice (P\u2009u003c\u20090.01). Higher levels of total CHO and FFA were noted in B6.V-Lepob/J mice than C57BL/6N mice (P\u2009u003c\u20090.05). These results were concurrent with frequency, lower average urine volume and other urinary voiding dysfunctions in B6.V-Lepob/J mice. MRI assessments demonstrate marked increase in body fat and prostate volume in these mice. Compared to C57BL/6N mice, histological analysis of the prostate from B6.V-Lepob/J mice showed increased proliferation, gland crowding, and infiltration of immune cells in the stroma; whereas the bladder urothelium was slightly thicker and appears more proliferative in these mice. The regression and correlation analysis indicate that peritoneal fat (R\u2009=\u20090.853; P\u2009u003c\u20090.02), CHO (R\u2009=\u20090.729; P\u2009u003c\u20090.001), BG (R\u2009=\u20090.712; P\u2009u003c\u20090.001) and prostate volume (R\u2009=\u20090.706; P\u2009u003c\u20090.023) strongly correlate with LUTS whereas BMI, WC, INS, and FFA moderately correlate with the prevalence of bladder dysfunction.CONCLUSIONOur results suggest that LUTS may be attributable in part to obesity and MetS. Validation of an in vivo model may lead to understand the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of obesity-related LUTS in humans.

Amongst patients seeking medical attention for IBS 70\u201390% may have psychiatric co-morbidity, most commonly major depression. In contrast, few studies have looked at the prevalence of IBS in psychiatric patients. To our knowledge, there are no studies assessing the prevalence of IBS in patients with schizophrenia. Using a semistructured clinical interview to study the prevalence of IBS, we compared 47 patients with schizophrenia to an age-matched control group ( n = 40) of patients who were seeking treatment in a primary care physicians office for other medical illnesses. IBS was diagnosed according to the criteria of Drossman et al. Nineteen percent ( n = 9) of the patients with schizophrenia met criteria for IBS in contrast to 2.5% ( n = 1) of the control group ( p = 0.012). Schizophrenic patients seldom complain of gastrointestinal symptoms until specifically asked. Therefore, it may be important to inquire about gastrointestinal symptoms prior to initiating pharmacotherapy in order to differentiate side effects from a prior existing condition. Prospective studies should address the question whether remission of psychosis leads to improvement or resolution of IBS.",

We reviewed the charts of 117 outpatients maintained on conventional antipsychotics at three New York hospitals: Hutchings Psychiatric Center (HPC), Syracuse Veterans Affairs Medical Center (SVA), and the Continuing Day Treatment Program (CDT). The major reasons for maintaining patients on conventional antipsychotics were good response (50%), patient choice (45%), and physician choice (36%). Despite the high incidence of tardive dyskinesia at all three hospitals (range: 12%-50%), physicians often did not discuss the risks/benefits of continuing conventional antipsychotics with the patients. The treating psychiatrist discussed alternative treatments with 37% of patients at SVA, 58% at HPC, and 68% at CDT (P = 0.066, df = 2, Pearson chi(2) test). For patients who are receiving any antipsychotic therapy, discussions about the risks/benefits of treatments are integral for optimal treatment and medicolegal purposes.",

This article describes a retrospective chart review of patients from various clinical settings, including a continuing day treatment program, two inpatient programs, and a large private practice. Information was obtained with regard to weight, fasting blood glucose, lipid profiles, EKG changes, and medical comorbidities. The patients included those treated with conventional antipsychotic agents, clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine. No one antipsychotic agent was associated with a statistically significantly higher prevalence of diabetes, lipid abnormalities, or EKG problems. It was noted, however, that there were higher rates of diabetes (17%), lipid abnormalities (43%), and hypertension (30%) across the sample. This finding suggests that the high prevalence of diabetes, lipid abnormalities, and hypertension in a young, chronically psychiatrically ill population makes the case for aggressive screening.",

The syndrome is best defined as chronic abdominal discomfort with changes in stool frequency, consistency, and passage, with associated symptoms such as abdominal bloating or presence of mucus in stools. Several studies have shown that up to 70% to 90% of patients with IBS who seek treatment have psychiatric comorbidity, most notably mood and anxiety disorders. Recent studies have shown a high prevalence of IBS in psychiatric patients who seek treatment, with a prevalence of 19% in schizophrenia, 29% in major depression, and 46% in panic disorder among other disorders.

However, weight gain in the range of 7 to 10% is commonly associated with the use of antipsychotic medications and can have a negative impact on patient quality of life. Being overweight or obese can lead to serious medical conditions, including insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, arthritis and coronary heart disease. The physical and psychological consequences of weight gain are an added burden for patients with schizophrenia or other mental disorders. Successful strategies to prevent and manage weight gain include diet and exercise interventions and, in some cases, switching to a different antipsychotic agent.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Approximately 50% of pharmacy prescriptions in the United States are filled with generic drugs, which have improved substantially in quality owing to increased governmental regulations. The remaining medicoeconomic question regards whether or not brand-name medications are worth the price. This study evaluates these questions for the brand-name mood stabilizer divalproex sodium and its generic counterpart, valproic acid. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients who had been taking divalproex and had been switched to valproic acid at 2 local mental health facilities in 1997. Data collected from the inpatient- and day-treatment charts for these 28 patients included dose, duration, side effects, and efficacy (determined using retrospective chart review and the Clinical Global Impressions scale [CGI]) of divalproex sodium compared with valproic acid treatment. RESULTS: t Tests for dependent samples revealed that valproic acid was administered at higher doses than divalproex sodium, but these treatments did not differ in efficacy on the basis of CGI scores. Fisher exact test analyses revealed a trend toward more nausea with valproic acid; also, the combination of nausea, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea occurred more often in valproic acid-treated patients. There were no differences in the discontinuation of either medicine because of side effects, or in the use of medications to treat gastrointestinal side effects. Efficacy was similar for valproic acid and divalproex sodium. There was no single, significant side effect increase for valproic acid; however, when grouped together, gastrointestinal side effects were statistically significantly increased in valproic acid-treated patients. This appears clinically insignificant because of the lack of difference in drug discontinuation rate or gastrointestinal medication use. CONCLUSION: Given these results and that valproic acid is much less expensive than divalproex sodium, valproic acid appears to be a satisfactory substitution for divalproex sodium in the treatment of frequently hospitalized psychotic patients.",

Using a semi-structured clinical interview to study the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome, we compared 41 patients seeking treatment for panic disorder in an outpatient setting to an age- and sex-matched control group of 40 patients who were seeking treatment in a general physician's office for other medical illnesses. The control group did not have any Axis I disorders. IBS was diagnosed according to the criteria of Drossman et al. Nineteen (46.3%) patients with panic disorder met the criteria for IBS, in contrast to one (2.5%) patient in the control group (p < 0.000005). Patients with panic disorder and IBS were more likely to report symptoms of back pain as well as a personal history of bowel disease compared to patients with panic disorder but without IBS. IBS is fairly common in patients seeking treatment for panic disorder. Prospective studies should address the question whether treatment of panic disorder leads to an improvement or resolution of the symptoms of IBS.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare risperidone and olanzapine for efficacy, tolerability, need for concomitant mood stabilizers, and cost of treatment in bipolar and schizoaffective disorders. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 36 consecutive outpatients with DSM-IV bipolar or schizoaffective disorder seen in 3 settings who received risperidone or olanzapine for at least 1 month between May and August 1997. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD doses were 3.7 +/- 3.5 mg/day of risperidone and 12.0 +/- 5.4 mg/day of olanzapine. Between-treatment differences in patient characteristics, psychiatric history, Clinical Global Impressions scale ratings, and duration of treatment were not significant. Similar proportions of patients in the 2 groups reported side effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, and precipitation of mania by the respective drug. Patients in the olanzapine group received a significantly higher dose of concomitant lithium than those receiving risperidone (mean daily lithium doses: risperidone group, 750 +/- 150 mg; olanzapine group, 1211 +/- 186 mg; p =.006). The total daily acquisition cost per patient was $11.84 for olanzapine versus $5.81 for risperidone. CONCLUSION: Olanzapine and risperidone were equally efficacious and safe in the treatment of patients with bipolar or schizoaffective disorder, but treatment costs and dose of concomitant lithium were lower in risperidone-treated patients.",

Using a semistructured clinical interview to study the prevalence of IBS, we compared 31 patients seeking treatment for alcohol abuse or dependence in an outpatient setting with an age- and sex-matched control group of 40 patients who were seeking treatment in a general physician's office for other medical illnesses. The control group did not have any Axis I disorders. IBS was diagnosed according to the criteria of Drossman et al. Thirteen (41.9%) patients with alcohol abuse or dependence met the criteria for IBS, in contrast to 1 (2.5%) patient in the control group. We conclude that IBS is common and frequently underdiagnosed in patients with alcohol abuse or dependence.",

The measures used included the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, The Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, the Geriatric Depression Scale, the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, the Clinical Global Impression, and the Mini-Mental Status Examination.Despite being similar in age (mean age: 68 years), patients with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder had significantly greater negative symptoms (Cohen's d = 1.2), a higher clinical global impression of impairment (Cohen's d = 1.16), were less likely to drive (Cohen's d = 0.79), were less likely to be married (Cohen's d = 0.55), and less likely to live independently (Cohen's d = 0.45).Although the absolute ratings suggested both diagnostic samples had significant disability, those with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder had a greater degree of impairment.",

METHOD: The efficacy and safety of once-daily risperidone were assessed in a retrospective study of 27 patients with a variety of psychiatric disorders who were attending a community day treatment program. Their DSM-IV diagnoses included schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, major depression with psychosis, and posttraumatic stress disorder. They had received once-daily risperidone for a mean of more than 18 months. RESULTS: Disorders of most patients were controlled with once-daily dosages of 1 to 6 mg/day of risperidone. The nighttime once-daily risperidone dosage was well tolerated by patients. In addition, there was no increase in antipsychotic-related side effects, and compliance was enhanced. CONCLUSION: Risperidone was well tolerated, and no patient needed antiparkinsonian medications even at high dosages of risperidone once daily.",

It is well known that, under overload, FDDI can settle into one of many recurrent sets of states. The idea of desirable and undesirable states is introduced. A desirable state is one where users share the capacity more or less equally in each token rotation. It is shown that the response times of interactive users are adversely affected if the system operates in an undesirable set of states. The waiting time of heavy users can be reduced by forcing the system to settle into the desirable states. Simple control mechanisms are proposed to ensure that the system settle into the desirable states",

To improve the utilization of network resources and facilitate management and control, source types are organized into traffic classes. Cells belonging to different traffic classes are transported by separate virtual paths though the network. Approximations for the quality of service that should be maintained for each traffic class are developed. Approximations are then developed for estimating the bandwidth and buffer requirements of each traffic class and also for the switch node. The problem of assigning weights, given a set of traffic classes, is addressed. The set of traffic classes that require the least amount of resources is determined. The closely related problem of minimizing the number of traffic classes given a finite bandwidth is also discussed. The structure of the problem at hand is then exploited to develop an efficient heuristic",

        "abstract": "Periodontal disease and cardiovascular disease (CVD) share characteristics with respect to a number of risk factors. Some individuals frequently possesses a hyper-inflammatory monocytes phenotype, where peripheral blood monocytes secrete high levels of PGE2 IL-1\u03b1 and TNF\u03b1 mediators, thus placing them at greater risk for both periodontitis and CHD. The concept of focal infection has recently reappeared and may be applicable to the role of periodontitis in systemic disease. Circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS), released from Gram-negative bacteria, can predispose to thromboembolic events in the vascular tree, and LPS released from putative periodontal pathogen may contribute to tissue damage in this manner. Oral bacteria, including Streptococcus sanguis and the putative periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis, have been shown to have effects on the cardiovascular system by increasing platelet aggregation. Periodontal pathogens have been identified in atheromatous plaque. Oral infection increases the systemic inflammatory challenge to the vascular tree, with potentially damaging consequences. As an example, adult periodontal patients have been shown to have a high serum level of C-reactive protein (CRP), and levels of this particular inflammatory marker also correlate with measures of cardiovascular pathology. An increase in neutrophil numbers or their state of activation as a result of periodontal disease, or even gingivitis, may similarly have adverse effects on the cardiovascular system.",

Fish were exposed to sublethal concentration (1/3rd of LC50) (0.142\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121) for 15\u00a0days and corresponding changes in different haemato-biochemical parameters were recorded at the end of experimental period. Significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increase in white blood cell counts, blood glucose, serum complement reactive protein and serum cortisol level were noticed, whereas haemoglobin and serum total protein contents were significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) decreased. Aspartate amino transferase, catalase and super oxide dismutase activities were significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increased while alkaline phosphatase and malate dehydrogenase activities were significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) decreased. Similarly, 47\u00a0% inhibition in acetylcholine esterase activity was noticed due to fipronil stress. Results indicated that sublethal exposure of fipronil can induce haemato-biochemical alterations causing stress to C. carpio fry. Thus, haemato-biochemical parameters can be used as biomarkers for the sublethal toxicity of fipronil in the water bodies.",

Depression is highly common and according to WHO by 2020, it would be the second-most prevalent condition worldwide. Physical illnesses and bio-psychosocial factors are common determinants of depression.  Aims u0026 Objectives : 1. To estimate prevalence of depression, 2. To determine associated factors among college going students.  Material u0026   Methods:  A descriptive cross-sectional study conducted among college going students. Half of the colleges were selected randomly and sample size was distributed on the basis of probability proportional to size (PPS). Assigned number of students from each college was selected by simple random sampling. Sample size of 1300 was calculated using formula (n) = ( Z1-\u03b1 )2 P (100 - P ) / e2. General Health Questionnaire (12 items) was used to diagnose psychiatric morbidity and those with this were administered Becks Depression Inventory II (21 items) scale for assessing the prevalence and level of depression. Both the scales were translated in local language and self-administered. The data was compiled and analyzed using Epi Info TM .  Results:  A total of 1300 students were enrolled, psychiatric morbidity was present in 35% and prevalence of depression was 33%. Mild depression was found in 87% of the students with depression. Depression was higher among those aged u003e25 years, females, residing in nuclear families and studying science stream.  Conclusion : Family support and adequate treatment are most important pillars of management.",

        "abstract": "Several mechanobiology algorithms have been employed to simulate bone ingrowth around porous coated implants. However, there is a scarcity of quantitative comparison between the efficacies of commonly used mechanoregulatory algorithms. The objectives of this study are: (1) to predict peri-acetabular bone ingrowth using cell-phenotype specific algorithm and to compare these predictions with those obtained using phenomenological algorithm and (2) to investigate the influences of cellular parameters on bone ingrowth. The variation in host bone material property and interfacial micromotion of the implanted pelvis were mapped onto the microscale model of implant-bone interface. An overall variation of 17-88\u00a0% in peri-acetabular bone ingrowth was observed. Despite differences in predicted tissue differentiation patterns during the initial period, both the algorithms predicted similar spatial distribution of neo-tissue layer, after attainment of equilibrium. Results indicated that phenomenological algorithm, being computationally faster than the cell-phenotype specific algorithm, might be used to predict peri-prosthetic bone ingrowth. The cell-phenotype specific algorithm, however, was found to be useful in numerically investigating the influence of alterations in cellular activities on bone ingrowth, owing to biologically related factors. Amongst the host of cellular activities, matrix production rate of bone tissue was found to have predominant influence on peri-acetabular bone ingrowth.",

        "abstract": "The fixation of uncemented acetabular components largely depends on the amount of bone ingrowth, which is influenced by the design of the implant surface texture. The objective of this numerical study is to evaluate the effect of these implant texture design factors on bone ingrowth around an acetabular component. The novelty of this study lies in comparative finite element (FE) analysis of 3D microscale models of the implant-bone interface, considering patient-specific mechanical environment, host bone material property and implant-bone relative displacement, in combination with sequential mechanoregulatory algorithm and design of experiment (DOE) based statistical framework. Results indicated that the bone ingrowth process was inhibited due to an increase in interbead spacing from 200\u2009\u03bcm to 600\u2009\u03bcm and bead diameter from 1000\u2009\u03bcm to 1500\u2009\u03bcm and a reduction in bead height from 900\u2009\u03bcm to 600\u2009\u03bcm. Bead height, a main effect, was found to have a predominant influence on bone ingrowth. Among the interaction effects, the combination of bead height and bead diameter was found to have a pronounced influence on bone ingrowth process. A combination of low interbead spacing (P\u2009=\u2009200\u2009\u03bcm), low bead diameter (D\u2009=\u20091000\u2009\u03bcm), and high bead height (H\u2009=\u2009900\u2009\u03bcm) facilitated peri-acetabular bone ingrowth and an increase in average Young's modulus of newly formed tissue layer. Hence, such a surface texture design seemed to provide improved fixation of the acetabular component.",

        "title": "The effects of musculoskeletal loading regimes on numerical evaluations of acetabular component.",
        "abstract": "The importance of clinical studies notwithstanding, the failure assessment of implant-bone structure has alternatively been carried out using finite element analysis. However, the accuracy of the finite element predicted results is dependent on the applied loading and boundary conditions. Nevertheless, most finite element-based evaluations on acetabular component used a few selective load cases instead of the eight load cases representing the entire gait cycle. These in silico evaluations often suffer from limitations regarding the use of simplified musculoskeletal loading regimes. This study attempts to analyse the influence of three different loading regimes representing a gait cycle, on numerical evaluations of acetabular component. Patient-specific computer tomography scan-based models of intact and resurfaced pelvises were used. One such loading regime consisted of the second load case that corresponded to peak hip joint reaction force. Whereas the other loading regime consisted of the second and fifth load cases, which corresponded to peak hip joint reaction force and peak muscle forces, respectively. The third loading regime included all the eight load cases. Considerable deviations in peri-acetabular strains, standard error ranging between 115 and 400 \u00b5\u03b5, were observed for different loading regimes. The predicted bone strains were lower when selective loading regimes were used. Despite minor quantitative variations in bone density changes (less than 0.15 g cm(-3)), the final bone density pattern after bone remodelling was found to be similar for all the loading regimes. Underestimations in implant-bone micromotions (40-50 \u00b5m) were observed for selective loading regimes after bone remodelling. However, at immediate post-operative condition, such underestimations were found to be less (less than 5 \u00b5m). The predicted results highlight the importance of inclusion of eight load cases representing the gait cycle for in silico evaluations of resurfaced pelvis. ",

        "title": "THE EFFECTS OF CELLULAR ACTIVITIES ON ACETABULAR CUP FIXATION: A PARAMETRIC STUDY USING THREE-DIMENSIONAL FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS",
        "abstract": "Long-term biological fixation and stability of uncemented acetabular implant are influenced by peri-prosthetic bone ingrowth which is known to follow the principle of mechanoregulatory tissue differentiation algorithm. A tissue differentiation is a complex set of cellular events which are largely influenced by various mechanical stimuli. Over the last decade, a number of cell-phenotype specific algorithms have been developed in order to simulate these complex cellular events during bone ingrowth. Higher bone ingrowth results in better implant fixation. It is hypothesized that these cellular events might influence the peri-prosthetic bone ingrowth and thereby implant fixation. Using a three-dimensional (3D) microscale FE model representing an implant-bone interface and a cell-phenotype specific algorithm, the objective of the study is to evaluate the influences of various cellular activities on peri-prosthetic tissue differentiation. Consequently the study aims at identifying those cellular activities that may enhance implant fixation.  The 3D microscale implant-bone interface model, comprising of Porocast Bead of BHR implant, granulation tissue and bone, was developed and meshed in ANSYS (Fig. 1b). Frictional contact (\u00b5=0.5) was simulated at all interfaces. The displacement fields were transferred and prescribed at the top and bottom boundaries of the microscale model from a previously investigated macroscale implanted pelvis model (Fig. 1a) [4]. Periodic boundary conditions were imposed on the lateral surfaces. Linear elastic, isotropic material properties were assumed for all materials. Young9s modulus and Poisson9s ratios of bone and implant were mapped from the macroscale implanted pelvis [4]. A cell-phenotype specific mechanoregulatory algorithm was developed where various cellular activities and tissue formation were modeled with seven coupled differential equations [1, 2]. In order to evaluate the influence of various cellular activities, a Plackett-Burman DOE scheme was adopted. In the present study each of the cellular activity was assumed to be an independent factor. A total of 20 independent two-level factors were considered in this study which resulted in altogether 24 different combinations to be investigated. All these cellular activities were in turn assumed to be regulated by local mechanical stimulus [3]. The mechano-biological simulation was run until a convergence in tissue formation was attained.  The cell-phenotype specific algorithm predicted a progressive transformation of granulation tissue into bone, cartilage and fibrous tissue (Fig. 1c). Various cellular activities were found to influence the time to reach equilibrium in tissue differentiation and, thereby, attainment of sufficient implant fixation (Fig. 2, Table 1). Negative regression coefficients were predicted for the significant factors, differentiation rate of MSCs and bone matrix formation rate, indicating that these cellular activities favor peri-prosthetic bone ingrowth by facilitating rapid peri-prosthetic bone ingrowth. Osteoblast differentiation rate, on the contrary, was found to have the highest positive regression coefficient among the other cellular activities, indicating that an increase in this cellular activity delays the attainment of equilibrium in bone ingrowth prohibiting rapid implant fixation.

Using three-dimensional Finite Element models of intact and implanted pelvis, in combination with bone remodeling algorithm, the present study aims at gaining an insight into the evolutionary bone adaptation around a press-fit uncemented acetabular component. Eight static load cases of normal walking cycle, modeled by 21 muscle forces and hip joint reaction force, were considered in the present study in order to investigate deviation in load transfer due to implantation and peri-acetabular bone adaptation. Based on the results of the present study, a press-fit acetabular component was found to increase load transfer through acetabular cortex. Consequently, predominant bone apposition was observed within the acetabular peripheral cancellous bone. However, a reduction in the density of cancellous bone near the acetabular pole was also observed.",

        "abstract": "Patients having a medical history of oral cancer, infectious diseases or trauma are often advised surgical intervention with customized complete mandibular constructs (CMC) made of Titanium (Ti) scaffolds. A numerical framework based on a homogenization technique was developed to investigate the influence of pore architecture parameters on homogenized orthotropic material properties of the scaffolds. A comparative 3D Finite Element (FE) analysis of six CMC models, having homogenized orthotropic material properties, under a mastication cycle, was undertaken to pre-clinically determine the optimal CMC for a patient. Orthotropic material properties of Ti-scaffolds decreased with an increase in the inter-strut distance. Stress and strain distributions of CMC models during right molar bite were investigated. Despite small differences in stress distributions in the 'body' region of CMC models, the overall stress distribution (tensile and compressive) of CMC models (30-32\u202fMPa) were well comparable to that of an intact mandible (34.54\u202fMPa). Higher magnitudes of tensile strains were observed for models with 0.2\u202fmm (9884\u03bc\u025b) and 0.4\u202fmm strut diameter (SD), both having 0.5\u202fmm inter-strut distance (ID), at articular condyle area, body and symphysis equivalent part of the constructs. The maximum principal tensile strains were higher in the CMC models with 0.5\u202fmm ID as compared to those having 0.3\u202fmm ID. Comparatively, the scaffolds with lesser ID (0.3\u202fmm) resulted in higher stiffness, thereby evoking less principal strains in the CMC models. Moreover, considering the weight of the scaffolds, the CMC models having 0.3\u202fmm ID with 0.2\u202fmm SD and 0.5\u202fmm ID with 0.6\u202fmm SD seemed most appropriate for a patient.",

The purpose of the study is to develop a realistic 3D finite element (FE) model of the hemi-pelvis and to assess stress and strain distribution during a gait cycle. The FE modelling approach of the pelvic bone was based on CT scan data and image segmentation of cortical and cancellous bone boundaries. Application of hip-joint force through an anatomical femoral head having a cartilage layer was found to be more appropriate than a perfectly spherical head, thereby leading to more accurate stress-strain distribution in the acetabulum. Within the acetabulum, equivalent strains varied between 0.1% and 0.7% strain in the cancellous bone. High compressive (15-30 MPa) and low tensile (0-5 MPa) stresses were generated within the acetabulum. The hip-joint force is predominantly transferred from the acetabulum through the lateral cortex to the sacroiliac joint and the pubic symphysis. The study is useful to understand the load transfer within the acetabulum and for further investigations on acetabular prosthesis.",

The objective of the study is to gain an insight into the tissue differentiation around an acetabular component. A mapping framework has been developed to simulate appropriate mechanical environment in the three-dimensional microscale model, implement the mechanoregulatory tissue differentiation algorithm and subsequently assess spatial distribution of bone ingrowth around an acetabular component, quantitatively. The FE model of implanted pelvis subjected to eight static load cases during a normal walking cycle was first solved. Thereafter, a mapping algorithm has been employed to include the variations in implant\u2013bone relative displacement and host bone material properties from the macroscale FE model of implanted pelvis to the microscale FE model of the beaded implant\u2013bone interface. The evolutionary tissue differentiation was observed in each of the 13 microscale models corresponding to 13 acetabular regions. The total implant\u2013bone relative displacements, averaged over each region of the acetabulum, were found to vary between 10 and 60\u00a0\\(\\upmu \\hbox {m}\\). Both the linear elastic and biphasic poroelastic models predicted similar mechanoregulatory peri-prosthetic tissue differentiation. Considerable variations in bone ingrowth (13\u201388\u00a0%), interdigitation depth (0.2\u20130.82\u00a0mm) and average tissue Young\u2019s modulus (970\u20133430\u00a0MPa) were predicted around the acetabular cup. A progressive increase in the average Young\u2019s modulus, interdigitation depth and decrease in average radial strains of newly formed tissue layer were also observed. This scheme can be extended to investigate tissue differentiation for different surface texture designs on the implants.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The typical biomechanical failure mechanisms associated with cementless Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) are initial micromotion, stress shielding and interface stresses. While the former is a short-term load-induced failure criterion affiliated with the post-surgery rehabilitation period, the other two mechanisms are relatively longer term phenomena. At immediate post-operative stage, biologic fixation through bone ingrowth is yet to occur and implant stability is determined by the initial micromotion. However, by the time the other failure mechanisms become prominent, sufficient bone ingrowth already prevails and consequently, the implant-bone interface characteristic changes. Therefore, any preclinical simulation aimed at designing femoral implants needs to account for this dual interfacial behaviour while dealing with these failure objectives. The present study implements a hybrid framework comprised of neural network (NN), genetic algorithm (GA) and finite element (FE) analysis for a multi-criteria 3-D shape optimization of cementless femoral implant by addressing the dual interfacial behaviour. Bonded interfacial condition was used to analyse the effects of stress shielding and interface stresses, whereas a set of contact models were used to develop an NN for faster prediction of the initial micromotion based on implant geometry. The final trade-off implant models were analysed and subsequently, compared with a generic design of femoral implant.",

        "abstract": "Musculoskeletal loading plays an important role in pre-clinical evaluations of hip implants, in particular, bone ingrowth and bone remodelling. Joint force estimation using musculoskeletal models evolved as a viable alternative to in vivo measurement owing to the development of computational resources. This study investigated the efficiencies of four eminent open-source musculoskeletal models in order to determine the model that predicts the most accurate values of hip joint reaction and muscle forces during daily activities. Seven daily living activities of slow walking, normal walking, fast walking, sitting down, standing up, stair down and stair up were simulated in OpenSim using inverse dynamics method. Model predictions of joint kinematics, kinetics and muscle activation patterns were compared with published results. The estimated values of hip joint reaction force were found to corroborate well with in vivo measurements for each activity. Although the estimated values of hip joint reaction force were within a satisfactory range, overestimation of hip joint reaction force (75% BW of measured value) was observed during the late stance phase of walking cycles for all the models. In case of stair up, stair down, standing up and sitting down activities, the error in estimated values of hip joint reaction force were within ~20% BW of the measured value. Based on the results of our study, the London Lower Extremity Model predicted the most accurate value of hip joint reaction force and therefore can be used for applied musculoskeletal loading conditions for numerical investigations on hip implants.",

        "abstract": "In order to make magnesium (Mg) a successful candidate for fracture fixation devices, it is imperative to control the corrosion rate and enhance its elastic modulus. In the present work, we have prepared bioactive glass (BG) reinforced magnesium composite using spark plasma sintering (SPS). Simultaneous application of heat and pressure during SPS decreased the softening point of BG (600\u00b0C), allowing it to coat the Mg particles partially. As a result, BG was found along the Mg particle boundaries, which was confirmed by elemental mapping. Addition of BG improved microhardness and elastic modulus of Mg-BG composites. Corrosion behavior was studied by hydrogen evolution and immersion corrosion in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). After 64 h of immersion, Mg-10 wt % BG composite showed highest corrosion resistance. Quantitative micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) results indicated porosity increase in Mg-BG composites during immersion. The maximum increase in porosity (1.66%) was noticed for pure Mg while the minimum for Mg-10 wt % BG composite. MG63 cell-material interactions, using extract method, showed good cytocompatibility for Mg-10 wt % BG composite. The concentration of Mg ion in cell culture media was measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy after 24 h immersion of Mg/BG composites. The results indicated that using BG as reinforcement and SPS as sintering method; we can prepare corrosion resistant and high modulus Mg-BG composites that can be used for fabricating bone fracture fixation plates. \u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Simultaneous increase in temperature and applied pressure in hot press sintering resulted in a unique Mg-BG microstructure where BG partially coated Mg particles. The result was an 6.8 times increase in corrosion resistance of Mg-10\u202fwt% BG compared to pure Mg. The high corrosion resistance of Mg-10\u202fwt%BG had also reduced pH rise of the degradation media and hydrogen evolution, a significant concern for Mg based degradable biomaterials. Degradation behaviour of Mg-BG composites were also studied using micro-CT ( \u00b5 -CT) which showed lowest porosity increase for Mg-10BG after immersion in PBS for 168\u202fh.  In vitro  cytocompatibility studies were performed, by extract assay method, using MG-63 cells. The Live/Dead imaging and alamar blue assay indicated that Mg-10BG composites had higher cell viability and proliferation compared to other composites. The present result indicates that in situ BG coating, as prepared by hot press sintering, is an efficient way to increase corrosion resistance and cytocompatibility of Mg based biomaterials.",

Several polymorphisms were reported in  gene but C677T polymorphism is most studied and it has been reported to be risk factor for several diseases/disorders. The present study was designed to explore the frequency of  C677T polymorphism in North Indian healthy population. In addition to this a meta-analysis of published articles was also performed to estimate the global prevalence of  C677T polymorphism. A total of 1000 unrelated healthy subjects were selected for  C677T polymorphism analysis. Different databases were searched for eligible articles. Prevalence proportion with 95\u00a0% CI was used to determine global prevalence of T allele and TT genotype. Meta-analysis was performed by Open meta-analyst. In 1000 blood samples analyzed, the frequency of T allele and TT genotype was 11 and 1\u00a0% respectively. Results of the meta-analysis showed that the global prevalence of T allele and TT genotype were 24.0\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 21.7-26.5) and 7.7\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 6.5-8.9) respectively. In sub-group meta-analysis, the lowest frequency of T allele was found in Africans (10.3\u00a0%; 95\u00a0% CI 3.8-16.8), and highest in Europeans (34.1\u00a0%; 95\u00a0% CI 31.9-36.3). The frequency of T allele in the North India is 11\u00a0%. The results of the meta-analysis showed that the frequency of the T allele and the TT genotype of C677T is highest in the Caucasian population.",

C677T polymorphism of MTHFR gene was reported as risk factor for congenital defects, metabolic and neuropsychiatric disorders. Numerous case-control studies investigated C677T polymorphism as risk factor for schizophrenia but results of these studies were contradictory. To draw a conclusion, a meta-analysis of all available case-control studies was performed. PubMed, Google Scholar, Springer Link and Elsevier databases were searched for eligible case-control studies. Pooled odds ratio with 95%CI was used as an association measure and all statistical analyses were performed by Open Meta-Analyst and MIX software. Total 38 studies with 10,069 cases and 13,372 controls were included in the present meta-analysis. Results of meta-analysis showed significant associated between C677T polymorphism and risk of schizophrenia (OR TvsC \u00a0=\u00a01.18, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.10\u20131.27,  p \u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0 CTvsCC \u00a0=\u00a01.10, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.04\u20131.17,  p \u00a0=\u00a0 TTvsCC \u00a0=\u00a01.40, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.20\u20131.64,  p \u00a0=\u00a0 TT+CTvsCC \u00a0=\u00a01.19, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.09\u20131.30,  p \u00a0=\u00a0 p \u00a0=\u00a0 p \u00a0=\u00a0 p \u00a0=\u00a00.01).

The modulated low-field microwave absorption signals recorded for\n polycrystalline (grain size \u223c 10 \u00b5m) samples suggested the absence of weak-link character. The field dependent direct microwave\n absorption has been found to obey a \u2713H dependence with two different slopes, which indicated a transition from strongly pinned lattice to flux flow regime.",

        "abstract": "We have derived the velocities of meridional flows by measuring the latitudinal motions (or drifts) of umbrae of spot groups\n classified into three categories of area: 0\u2009\u2013\u20095\u00a0\u03bc, 5\u2009\u2013\u200910\u00a0\u03bc, and >10\u00a0\u03bc (\u03bc\u00a0area in millionths of the solar hemisphere). The latitudinal drifts (or the meridional flows) in all three categories are\n directed equatorward in both the northern and southern hemispheres. By sorting the spot groups into three area classes, we\n are able to relate the respective latitudinal drifts with the three depths in the convection zone where the footpoints of\n the flux loops of the spot groups of each area class are anchored. We obtain estimates of the anchor depths through a comparison\n of the rotation rates of the spot groups of each area class with the rotation-rate profiles from helioseismic inversions.\n The equatorward drifts obtained provide estimates of the meridional flows at the three depths in the convection zone and thereby\n suggest the presence of return meridional flows as envisaged in the flux-transport dynamo models, which have remained undetected\n so far. The data sources for this study are measurements of positions and areas of umbrae of sunspots from the photographic\n white-light images of the Sun of the Kodaikanal Observatory archives for the period 1906\u2009\u2013\u20091987 and a very similar, but independent,\n data set from the Mt. Wilson Observatory archives for the period 1917\u2009\u2013\u20091985.",

        "abstract": "During the past few decades, pharmaceutical industries have registered a quantum jump contributing to high economic growth, but simultaneously it has also given rise to severe environmental pollution. Untreated or allegedly treated pharmaceutical industrial wastewater (PIWW) creates a need for time to time assessment and characterization of discharged wastewater as per the standards provided by the regulatory authorities. To control environmental pollution, pharmaceutical industries use different treatment plans to treat and reuse wastewater. The characterization of PIWW using advanced and coupled techniques has progressed to a much advanced level, but in view of new developments in drug manufacture for emerging diseases and the complexities associated with them, better sophisticated instrumentation and methods of treatment are warranted. The bioremediation process to treat PIWW has undergone more intense investigation in recent decade. This results in the complete mineralization of pharmaceutical industries\u2019 wastewater and no waste product is obtained. Moreover, high efficiency and low operation cost prove it to be an effective tool for the treatment of PIWW. The present review focuses on the characterization as well as bioremediation aspects of PIWW.",

The water of all these rivers serves as the major source for drinking and irrigation purposes in these districts of the Kumaun region of Uttarakhand. River water samples collected in pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons of the years 2011 and 2012 were analyzed for various water quality characteristics. Statistical analyses indicate positive correlation among most of the chemical parameters. Piper diagram illustrates that all the water samples fall in Ca\u2013Mg\u2013HCO3 hydrochemical facies, Moreover, the suitability of water for drinking purposes determined by water quality index indicated that river water in both the seasons is unsuitable. Irrigation water quality of all the river water was found suitable during both the seasons according to the result of sodium adsorption ratio, sodium percentage and residual sodium carbonate. The present study revealed that major factors contributing to deterioration of water quality of all the rivers might be eutrophication, tourism, anthropogenic and geogenic processes. Therefore, to restore the vitality and water quality of all these rivers, proper water resource planning programme should be developed.",

        "abstract": "The seasonal variation in surface water quality of district Bageshwar, Uttarakhand (India) has been evaluated for 3\u00a0years from 2010 to 2012 for determining the suitability of water for drinking and irrigation needs. Water samples collected from different drinking water sources during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons in each year were analysed for 23 water quality parameters including physico-chemical and metal analyses. The analysed water quality parameters show seasonal variation and low concentration in post-monsoon season compared to pre-monsoon season due to dilution effects. The Box and Whisker plots indicated the dominance of major cations and anions in order of Ca2+\u00a0>\u00a0Mg2+\u00a0>\u00a0Na+\u00a0>\u00a0K+ and HCO3 \u2212\u00a0>\u00a0SO4 2\u2212\u00a0>\u00a0Cl\u2212 in both seasons, respectively. Piper trilinear diagram showed that most of the water samples fall in Ca\u2013Mg\u2013HCO3 hydrogeochemical facies. The water quality index revealed deteriorated water quality at some of the sources during pre- and post-monsoon seasons. The Wilcox diagram and calculated sodium adsorption ratio, residual sodium carbonate and sodium percent values indicate that the water was suitable for irrigation purposes in both the seasons. The results concluded that water quality at some of the locations is deteriorating and needs proper monitoring to preserve and maintain its quality to reduce hazards to local population.",

        "abstract": "In the present study, groundwater quality of district Udham Singh Nagar was evaluated using chemometric techniques viz. cluster, principal component and factor analyses to investigate the spatial variations of the most significant water quality parameters and to determine origin of pollution sources. Water samples collected from 6 sampling sites were analysed for 23 water quality parameters in pre- and post-monsoon seasons during the years 2010 and 2011. The concentration of alkalinity, total hardness, total dissolved solids, calcium, magnesium total coliform and faecal coliform of samples exceeded the Bureau of Indian Standard limits. Correlations among selected water quality parameters were statistically examined. Cluster analysis grouped 6 sampling sites into three clusters, i.e. less, moderate and high polluted, based on similarities of water quality characteristics. The principal component/factor analysis extracted four factors, which explain the ground water quality. Factor 1 (anthropogenic pollution) includes hardness, alkalinity, TDS calcium and magnesium, Factor 2 (hydrogeologic and agricultural pollution) includes turbidity, pH and nitrate, Factor 3 (industrial pollution) comprises  and Fe, and Factor 4 (agricultural pollution) includes sulphate. Piper diagram illustrated that water samples of the studied area are dominant of  hydrochemical facies. Moreover, water quality index (WQI) described the suitability of water sources for drinking purpose. Compared to 2010, WQI was higher in 2011, which led most of the sites unsuitable with grade \u2018E\u2019. The results revealed that the selected groundwater samples, being used for drinking and domestic purposes, are deteriorating, and thus highlighted the application of proper treatment strategy before domestic water supply.",

        "title": "ONLAY VERSUS RETRORECTUS MESH PLACEMENT FOR REPAIR OF VENTRAL ABDOMINAL HERNIAS",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION    :   Abdominal wall hernia is one of the most important subjects for all surgeons operating on abdomen. Ventral hernia is an umbrella term that includes several types of hernias occurring along the anterior abdominal wall. About 5% of the population develop a ventral hernia at some time in their life.Several techniques for the repair of ventral hernia have been described from time to time. Mesh repair has become the gold standard in the elective management of most ventral hernias. It can be categorized according to the way in which the mesh is placed as well as its relationship to the abdominal wall fascia. Each mesh location has its own risks and benefits. The ideal technique should result in low recurrence, reconstruction of a functional abdominal wall and low rate of complications.      AIMS AND OBJECTIVES   :  The aim of the present study is to evaluate and compare the efficacy of onlay and retrorectus mesh placement for repair of ventral abdominal hernia taking in consideration the intraoperative aspects and postoperative complications. This study is an effort to suggest the best open approach for repair of ventral hernia.    MATERIALS AND METHODS  : This is a prospective study in which a total of 50 patients were enrolled. Patients were divided into two groups, Group A included 25 patients managed by traditional onlay mesh repair and group B included 25 patients managed by retrorectus mesh repair. Only the patients with uncomplicated midline hernia not more than 10cm were included in the study.    RESULTS:   The operative time for retro-rectus repair was significantly higher than that of onlay mesh repair but the postoperative hospital stay was shorter in retro-rectus groupThere was no significant difference between both the groups in terms of seroma formation, Surgical site infection (SSI), mesh infection or recurrence. However, onlay repair was associated with complications like seroma formation and wound infection while incidence of complications in retrorectus repair group was nil.    CONCLUSION:   This study has a shorter follow-up period of 6 months, hence late recurrences could not be recorded. Although the operative time in the retro-rectus group was higher but the reduced postoperative stay and negligible incidence of postoperative complications emphasizes on the fact that retro\u2011rectus mesh placement is a simple and effective technique that could be adopted widely by surgeons.",

        "abstract": "Food legumes play an important role in attaining both food and nutritional security along with sustainable agricultural production for the well-being of humans globally. The various traits of economic importance in legume crops are complex and quantitative in nature, which are governed by quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Mapping of quantitative traits is a tedious and costly process, however, a large number of QTLs has been mapped in soybean for various traits albeit their utilization in breeding programmes is poorly reported. For their effective use in breeding programme it is imperative to narrow down the confidence interval of QTLs, to identify the underlying genes, and most importantly allelic characterization of these genes for identifying superior variants. In the field of functional genomics, especially in the identification and characterization of gene responsible for quantitative traits, soybean is far ahead from other legume crops. The availability of genic information about quantitative traits is more significant because it is easy and effective to identify homologs than identifying shared syntenic regions in other crop species. In soybean, genes underlying QTLs have been identified and functionally characterized for phosphorous efficiency, flowering and maturity, pod dehiscence, hard-seededness, \u03b1-Tocopherol content, soybean cyst nematode, sudden death syndrome, and salt tolerance. Candidate genes have also been identified for many other quantitative traits for which functional validation is required. Using the sequence information of identified genes from soybean, comparative genomic analysis of homologs in other legume crops could discover novel structural variants and useful alleles for functional marker development. The functional markers may be very useful for molecular breeding in soybean and harnessing benefit of translational research from soybean to other leguminous crops. Thus, soybean crop can act as a model crop for translational genomics and breeding of quantitative traits in legume crops. In this review, we summarize current status of identification and characterization of genes underlying QTLs for various quantitative traits in soybean and their significance in translational genomics and breeding of other legume crops.",

        "abstract": "Allelic combinations of major photoperiodic (E1, E3, E4) and maturity (E2) genes have extended the adaptation of quantitative photoperiod sensitive soybean crop from its origin (China \u223c35\u25e6N latitude) to both north (up to \u223c50\u25e6N) and south (up to 40\u25e6S) latitudes, but their allelic status and role in India (6-35\u25e6N) are unknown. Loss of function and hypoactive alleles of these genes are known to confer photoinsensitivity to long days and early maturity. Early maturity has helped to adapt soybean to short growing season of India. We had earlier found that all the Indian cultivars are sensitive to incandescent long day (ILD) and could identify six insensitive accessions through screening 2071 accessions under ILD. Available models for ILD insensitivity suggested that identified insensitive genotypes should be either e3/e4 or e1 (e1-nl or e1-fs) with either e3 or e4. We found that one of the insensitive accessions (EC 390977) was of e3/e4 genotype and hybridized it with four ILD sensitive cultivars JS 335, JS 95-60, JS 93-05, NRC 37 and an accession EC 538828. Inheritance studies and marker-based cosegregation analyses confirmed the segregation of E3 and E4 genes and identified JS 93-05 and NRC 37 as E3E3E4E4 and EC 538828 as e3e3E4E4. Further, genotyping through sequencing, derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences (dCAPS) and cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences (CAPS) markers identified JS 95-60 with hypoactive e1-as and JS 335 with loss of function e3-fs alleles. Presence of photoperiodic recessive alleles in these two most popular Indian cultivars suggested for their role in conferring early flowering and maturity. This observation could be confirmed in F2 population derived from the cross JS 95-60 \u00d7 EC 390977, where individuals with e1-as e1-as and e4e4 genotypes could flower 7 and 2.4 days earlier, respectively. Possibility of identification of new alleles ormechanism for ILD insensitivity and use of photoinsensitivity in Indian conditions have been discussed.",

A total of 42 polymorphic SSRs had amplified 126 alleles which served as raw data for estimation of genetic relationship and population structure among 90 accessions. Rare alleles of four and three SSRs were detected in accessions IC18768 and IC15089, respectively. Gene diversity in the population ranges from 0.065 to 0.717 with a mean value of 0.411.

        "abstract": "Abstract The label free real time surface plasmon resonance based immuno-sensing system was first time demonstrated in the authors\u2019 lab using a mercaptoundecanoic acid modified gold sensor chip. The kinetics of the antigen\u2013antibody interaction was determined for optimization of resonance signal intensity for the detection of antigen(s) of fungal teliospores-causative entities of Karnal bunt disease of wheat incited by Tilletia indica. The approach involves the use of a rabbit polyclonal (anti-teliospore) antibody and mono-specific antibody generated against intact teliospores and purified diagnostic antigen of 28 kDa protein. The sensitivity of each of these two immunosensors constructed with the different concentrations of teliosporic antigen was determined by sensogram analysis which showed detection sensitivity as low as 625 and 156 pg which is equivalent to 2.5 and 1.0 teliospores over the sensor surface by getting an angle of dip indicating greater affinity of raised anti-teliospore antibodies and monospecific antibody respectively. By using kinetic evaluation software, the equilibrium constant (KD) and maximum binding capacity of analyte (Bmax) values were calculated and found to be 3.45 and 331.8 nM respectively using polyclonal and 1.57 and 289.57 nM respectively using monospecific antibody.",

Pusa Ruby) plants. For confirmation at seedlings and maturity stage, transgenic (T7) and wild type plants were sprayed with various Kanamycin concentrations (100\u2013400\u00a0mg/l). Only the wild type plants sprayed with concentrations \u2265300\u00a0mg/l developed typical chlorotic symptoms after 2\u00a0days, thus differentiating from the transgenic. For transgenic confirmation at earlier stage, transgenic and wild type seeds were germinated on filter paper soaked with Kanamycin solutions (100\u2013500\u00a0mg/l). Opening of cotyledonary leaves and growth of wild type seedlings reduced considerably in Kanamycin concentrations \u2265200\u00a0mg/l, than the transgenic, thereby differentiating from the transgenic. The transgenic confirmation experiments were repeated in subsequent T8, T9 and T10 generations with the same results. Thus, the Kanamycin resistance based transgenic confirmation methods are of wide applications for research community, as well as for enforcing bio-safety regulations, especially during the containment and confined field trials.",

Forty eight genotypes were evaluated for agronomic traits, yield and characters related to Al tolerance. The components of variability revealed high magnitude and highly heritable nature of the variations. High heritability with high to moderate value of genetic advance over mean was exhibited by majority of morphological traits used in the study. Significant correlations were observed for aluminum tolerance related traits, agronomic and yield traits. Principal components analysis revealed that the first three most informative components accounted for 70\u00a0% of the variance. The clustering pattern as revealed by dendrogram, based on average distance, classified the accessions into five clusters. Several high performing genotypes namely, N-861, Khougjai Phou, Posimot, Aaha and Epyo were found in the study which can be used for future breeding purposes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This study attempted to investigate the reuse potential of flocculated wastewater for the growth of microalgae species and to understand the relationship between microalgae growth parameters and metabolites extraction using a fuzzy logic model. For these purposes, batch experiments were conducted using two microalgae species, namely,  Chlorella sorokiniana  and  Scenedesmus obliquus , cultivated in different types of flocculated wastewater, viz., BlueGreen (BG11), polymer (P ww ), chitosan (CH ww ) and alum (A ww ). Results indicated that a logistic model fitted well the biomass profiles with  r  2 -values u003e0.95. The carrying capacities of  C.\u00a0sorokiniana  (K: 45.13\u00a0mg\u00a0L \u22121 ) and  S.\u00a0obliquus  (K: 71.59\u00a0mg\u00a0L \u22121 ) grown in the CH ww  medium were significantly ( p  ww  showed a good physiological health throughout the growth period. It was found that higher extraction yields of lipids: 16.0\u201319.8% and carbohydrates: 19.98\u201320.43% (w/w) of the dry weight were obtained when the microalgae species were grown in the CH ww  wastewater. Further, a fuzzy inference system confirmed the experimental data by predicting the yields of lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins at particular inputs of logistic model parameters and physiological health condition ( r  2 -values\u00a0u003e\u00a00.98). It was concluded that CH ww  could be used as an efficient flocculated wastewater for the growth of microalgae species and that the suggested modeling technique was promising.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Efficient dewatering and drying at lower cost have been a requirement in reducing the cost of microalgal biomass production. The self-flocculation capacity of  Scenedesmus obliquus  and the hydrophobic nature of polypropylene non-woven fabric membrane (PNM) are explored in this study. Formation of \u2018algal bio-filter layer\u2019 due to natural forces showed the efficiency of the process. Compared to the conventional methods, the cost of harvesting reduced substantially. The physico-chemical and mechanical properties of the harvested cake were studied. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on PNM usage for dewatering and drying as well as algal cake properties. The membrane showed high biomass recovery efficiency (94%) for  Scenedesmus  sp. but very low (58%) for  Chlorella sorokiniana  (non-self-flocculating). Dewatering on sand-bed followed by drying on wire-gauge (10.5% m.c) found to be the best arrangement. Solar drying of 1\u20132\u00a0cm thick slurry was achieved within 34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0h. Based on drying period, true density, bulk density, inter-cake porosity, breaking strength, grinding and selective physical properties, obtaining a 2-mm-thick cake was comparatively more energy efficient for post-harvest operations. The estimated cost of pilot-scale dewatering-drying was $ 0.048 per kg of dry algal biomass. Dehydration using PMN followed by natural drying was found to be energy efficient and comparatively very cost effective for pilot scale harvesting.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This study attempted to determine the yield of extractable metabolites and the cost of oil production from  Scenedesmus obliquus  cultivated in municipal wastewater. The microalgae achieved a biomass concentration of 1.64\u202fg\u202fL \u22121  as well as pollutant removal efficiencies of 87.86% COD, 86.16% NH 4  + -N, and \u2248100% PO 4  3\u2212 -P. The harvested microalgae were subjected to different drying and cell disruption techniques for lipid extraction, and the residual biomass was used to recover proteins and carbohydrates. Principal component analysis was employed to evaluate the metabolic yields obtained from sun-, freeze-, and oven-drying methods and microwave-, sonication-, autoclaving-, and osmotic shock-disruption techniques. The lipid yield varied between 4.90\u00b1\u202f0.42% for sun-dried biomass subjected to osmotic shock and 25.39\u00b1\u202f1.08% for freeze-drying with microwave-assisted extraction. Protein yield of the whole microalgae cells (31.26\u00b1\u202f3.76%) was comparable ( p \u202fu003e\u202f0.05) to that resulting from lipid-extracted microalgae by either autoclaving or osmotic shock. Carbohydrate yield of the intact microalgae cells (19.80\u00b1\u202f1.49%) was comparable ( p \u202fu003e\u202f0.05) to that of lipid-extracted microalgae from amongst all the cell disruption methods. Results of a techno-economic analysis indicated that the cost of oil production from microalgae varied between $0.883 and $2.088 per liter. These results revealed the feasibility of using a sequential extraction of lipids followed by proteins and carbohydrates.",

The biomass was grown in a pilot-scale raceway pond receiving domestic wastewater discharges. The microalgae achieved treatment efficiencies of 76.5% NH 4  + -N, 83.1% PO 4  3\u2212 -P, 73.9% biological oxygen demand (BOD), and 42.8% chemical oxygen demand (COD). During microalgal harvesting, the highest biomass recoveries of 99.0%, 97.5%, and 96.5% were obtained by alum 300\u202fmg/L at pH 7, chitosan 100\u202fmg/L at pH 7, and cationic polymer 10\u202fmg/L at pH 10, respectively. The protein, carbohydrate, and lipid yields of polymer-harvested biomass were 28.0%, 12.4%, and 17.4% (dry cell weight), respectively, which were higher than those obtained when applying either alum or chitosan flocculants. Moreover, the cationic polymer provided no detrimental effects on the fractions of fatty acids derived from the harvested microalgal cells. The microalgal biomass subjected to flocculation by either polymer or chitosan were entire and intact, whereas the lysis of cells was noticed during the alum flocculation process.",

In this study, novel biocompatible self-assembled nanocomplexes (NCs) between carboxylmethylated pullulan t335 (CMP) with polyallylamine (CMP\u2013PAA NCs) were developed for plasmid DNA (pDNA) and pH-sensitive doxorubicin (DOX) delivery. DOX was conjugated to CMP (DOX\u2013CMP) via hydrazone and confirmed by FTIR and 1H-NMR. In vitro release studies of pH-sensitive DOX\u2013CMP conjugate showed 23 and 85 % release after 48 h at pH 7.4 (physiological pH) and pH 5 (intracellular/tumoral pH), respectively. The CMP\u2013PAA NCs or DOX\u2013CMP\u2013PAA NCs self-assembled into a nanosized (<250 nm) spherical shape as confirmed by DLS and TEM. The hemolysis and cytotoxicity study indicated that the CMP\u2013PAA NCs did not show cytotoxicity in comparison with plain polyallylamine. Gel retardation assay showed complete binding of pDNA with CMP\u2013PAA NCs at 1:2 weight ratio. CMP\u2013PAA NCs/pDNA showed significantly higher transfection in HEK293 cells compared to PAA/pDNA complexes. Confocal imaging demonstrated successful cellular uptake of DOX\u2013CMP\u2013PAA NCs in HEK293 cells. Thus, NCs hold great potential for targeted pDNA and pH-sensitive intratumoral drug delivery.",

        "abstract": "There is a need of an efficient and safe non-viral gene delivery carrier due to promising future of nucleic acid-based therapeutics in the treatment of intractable diseases. Cytotoxicity and cost are the major concerns with current quaternary ammonium-based cationic liposomes. The major aim of current research work was development and in vitro evaluation of arginine-anchored nanoliposomes for gene delivery. l-Arginine\u2013fatty acid conjugate was synthesized and characterized using IR, NMR, and mass spectroscopy. Synthesized conjugate\u2014lauroyl arginine ethyl ester (LAE) was successfully incorporated into liposomes. Effect of nanocarrier composition on DNA binding was evaluated by preparing solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) and self nanoemulsifying system (SNES) using same LAE concentration. Effect of cationic head on DNA binding was also evaluated. Arginine-anchored nanoliposomes\u2014arginoplexes (APX) showed superior DNA-binding affinity. Surface PEG was expected to cause hindrance in DNA binding in SLNs and SNES. Guanidino group was found to be a better cationic head for DNA binding compared to primary amine or quaternary amine. Gel retardation assay was performed to optimize the ratio of DNA to LAE in nanocarrier. Serum stability, haemolysis, cytotoxicity, and transfection studies were carried out to evaluate APX. Binding of DNA to APX was found to be stable in the presence of serum, and no degradation of DNA was observed. APX containing 2\u00a0mg/ml LAE which exhibited particle size of ~72\u00a0nm with zeta potential of +57.5\u00a0mV, showed lower cytotoxicity and better transfection. APX can be a promising carrier for gene delivery.",

        "abstract": "The aims of the research work were to synthesize ethyl(cholesteryl carbamoyl)-L-arginate (ECCA), an arginine-conjugated cholesterol derivative, and to evaluate its application as a gene delivery vector. The interactions of ECCA with DNA duplex were studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It was found that the guanidine group of ECCA could interact with the phosphate group of DNA through ionic interactions as well as hydrogen bonds. The structure of DNA was stable throughout the simulation time. Liposomes were formulated using ECCA and soya phosphatidylcholine (SPC) by a thin-film hydration method. They had the particle size of ~\u2009150\u00a0nm and the zeta potential of +\u200951\u00a0mV. To ensure the efficient binding of DNA to the liposomes, the ratio of DNA to ECCA was optimized using gel retardation assay. Further, serum stability, haemolysis and cytotoxicity studies were carried out to determine the stability and safety of the lipoplexes. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to determine the interaction of DNA and cationic liposomes. Cellular uptake pathway was determined by studying the uptake of coumarin-loaded lipoplexes at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and in the presence of uptake inhibitors, i.e. genistein, chlorpromazine and methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin. Transfection studies were carried out to evaluate the transfection efficacy of the ECCA-loaded lipoplexes. The binding of DNA and lipoplexes was found to be stable in the presence of serum, and no degradation of DNA was observed. The lipoplexes showed low haemolysis and cytotoxicity. The uptake of coumarin-loaded liposomes was decreased up to ~\u200920% in the presence of clathrin- and caveola-mediated uptake inhibitors, indicating a role of both the pathways in the uptake of the inhibitors. Satisfactory transfection efficiency was obtained compared to Lipofectamine. Thus, cationic cholesterol derivative is a useful tool for gene delivery vector.",

        "abstract": "Differential expression of homomorphous variants of H2A family of histone H2A.1 and H2A.2 have been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma and maintenance of undifferentiated state of hepatocyte. However, not much is known about the transcriptional regulation of these H2A variants. The current study revealed the presence of 43bp 5'-regulatory region upstream of translation start site and a 26bp 3' stem loop conserved region for both the H2A.1 and H2A.2 variants. However, alignment of both H2A.1 and H2A.2 5'-untranslated region (UTR) sequences revealed no significant degree of homology between them despite the coding exon being very similar amongst the variants. Further, transient transfection coupled with dual luciferase assay of cloned 5' upstream sequences of H2A.1 and H2A.2 of length 1.2 (-1056 to +144) and 1.379kb (-1160 to +219) from experimentally identified 5'UTR in rat liver cell line (CL38) confirmed their promoter activity. Moreover, in silico analysis revealed a presence of multiple CpG sites interspersed in the cloned promoter of H2A.1 and a CpG island near TSS for H2A.2, suggesting that histone variants transcription might be regulated epigenetically. Indeed, treatment with DNMT and HDAC inhibitors increased the expression of H2A.2 with no significant change in H2A.1 levels. Further, methyl DNA immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative analysis of DNA methylation using real-time PCR revealed hypo-methylation and hyper-methylation of H2A.1 and H2A.2 respectively in embryonic and HCC compared to control adult liver tissue. Collectively, the data suggests that differential DNA methylation on histone promoters is a dynamic player regulating their expression status in different pathophysiological stages of liver.",

        "title": "Complementing Teacher Evaluation by Self and Peer Assessment to Promote Reflective Teaching-Learning in Undergraduate Physics Laboratory Courses at IGNOU",
        "abstract": "Abstract: Self-assessment, as a significant aspect of self regulatory learning, provides ample opportunities to the learners to take up responsibility of their learning independently. Peer assessment, as a collaborative learning technique, gives scope for developing critical thinking in the learners as they utilise their judgement skills to assess the work and progress of fellow learners based on established set of criteria. Self and Peer assessment can contribute to the comprehensive evaluation to a large extent. Moreover learners\u2019 participation in evaluation could be used to enrich their learning experiences through the Open and Distance Learning system. However, so far there has not been any extensive research reported in this area, particularly in the Indian context. This research was undertaken to study how self and peer assessment compliments teacher evaluation and promotes reflective teachinglearning. The evaluation methodology of the B.Sc. programme of Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) stipulates that for every learner, laboratory work and viva voce should be graded by Academic Counsellors (ACs) on a day-to-day basis as part of the continuous evaluation. The formative evaluation by ACs and the feedback of ACs is expected to provide opportunities to learners to assess their performance and improve their knowledge and skills. This research was undertaken to understand how far self and peer assessment would complement evaluation by ACs, help promote reflective teaching and impact performance of learners of undergraduate physics laboratory courses. The present study reveals that peer evaluation and continuous teacher evaluation had a positive correlation with reflective teaching-learning and gave a greater self-confidence to all the learners who participated in this research. At the end of the course, they were more confident as independent learners. This became amply evident in their term-end examination performances. We understand that it would be desirable to include self and peer assessment in the continuous evaluation component of the various experimental courses.",

Aqueous and organic solvent extracts of culture supernatant were investigated for antimicrobial activity. Bioactive fractions, after column chromatography separation, were subjected to GC-MS analysis. Based on 16S rDNA sequence result, isolate TD-093 showed nearest match to Saccharothrix (96%) and is a potential new species. Aqueous and organic solvent extracts showed antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Escherichia coli as well as clinical isolates (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii). GC-MS metabolite fingerprinting resulted in 32 compounds belonging to fatty acid, hydrocarbon, alcohol, aldehyde, amide, ester, ketone, disulfide, and nitrile chemical groups. Combination analyses of the compounds based on retention time, similarity index, mass ion spectra, and retention indices-observed and calculated, showed that many of the compounds could be presumed to be novel. Further, four compounds showed retention indices that have not been documented in databases. In silico analysis (using software Prediction of Activity of Spectra for Substances) of compounds predicted by GC-MS data showed that 21 compounds had potential antibacterial activity.",

        "abstract": "The slow pace of discovery of new effective drugs against multi-drug resistant pathogens and largely unsuccessful combinatorial chemistry has resulted in shifting the focus back to natural products as sources of lead molecules for antimicrobial drugs, mainly due to their structural diversity. Investigation of under-explored habitats for potentially novel microorganisms provides for wider chemodiversity. In this study, four actinomycetes, namely UK-274, UK-281, UK-282 and UK-285, which showed broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifungal activities, were isolated from Timli forest range of the biodiversity-rich Himalayan region. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that the nearest neighbours of the isolates were , and  with similarity values ranging between 97 and 98% suggesting their potential as new isolates. Further morphological and phenotypic characterization strengthened this assumption. Isolate UK-282, of the rare actinomycetes  group, was found to produce antimicrobial activity. Metabolite fingerprinting of ethyl acetate fraction of isolate UK-282 by GC-MS and 1H NMR analysis showed the presence of three novel compounds. The study underlines that a combination approach of bioprospecting of under-studied habitats and focus on rare actinomycetes may result in the identification of novel chemodiversity.",

In the proteomics era, Y2H has created a niche of its own by providing protein interaction maps for various organisms. Owing to limited coding capacities of their genomes, viruses are dependent on their host cellular machinery for successful infection. Identification of the key players orchestrating the survival of virus in their host is essential for understanding viral life cycle and devising strategies to prevent interactions resulting in pathogenesis. In this chapter, Y2H assay will be explained in detail for studying viral-host protein interactions of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). ",

        "abstract": "Objective:  The aim of the current study was to isolate and identify the bacteriocinogenic strain exhibiting broad range antimicrobial activity and antibiofilm activity from soil of animal farms.   Methods:  In the current study, bacterial strains were isolated from soil of twelve different regions of animal farm all over India and screened for antimicrobial activity against  Staphylococcus epidermidis ,  Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas fluorescence  and  Escherichia coli.  Antibiofilm ability of these selected strains was checked on preformed biofilm of  S. epidermidis  and in addition biofilm disruption potential was also determined. The potent bacterial strain was identified at molecular level by 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing.     Results:  30 out of   231 strains isolated from soil were selected on the basis of antibacterial activity against  S. epidermidis.  One potential candidate (GAS 101) exhibited \u226599% inhibition against  S. epidermidis ,  M. luteus, P. fluorescence  and  E. coli  and also showed antibiofilm activity. GAS 101 16S rDNA sequencing data identified it as  Bacillus subtilis.  The sequence of  B. subtilis  was submitted to genbank under accession no. KJ564301.   Conclusion:   B. subtilis  GAS 101 isolated from soil of animal farm showed the antibacterial activity against all indicator organisms and also displayed antibiofilm activity against preformed biofilm and inhibited biofilm formation of  S. epidermidis .",

        "abstract": "Abstract    Staphylococcus epidermidis  has emerged as an important cause of nosocomial infections. These infections are very difficult to cure due to formation of persistent and recurrent biofilm, which decreases the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents. Phytochemicals, especially in combination, can lower the dose of antimicrobial agent needed, reduce the toxicity and diminish the probability of developing resistance to microorganisms. The present investigation was undertaken to study the effect of cinnamaldehyde with other essential oil components (thymol, thymoquinone and eugenol) on the growth of  S. epidermidis  planktonic culture and its biofilm. All compounds used in the current study were found to be effective against the planktonic culture and biofilm of  S. epidermidis . Thymol and cinnamaldehyde showed synergistic antimicrobial activity which considerably reduced the dose needed compared with cinnamaldehyde alone. Cinnamaldehyde in combination with other compounds showed time- and concentration-dependent enhanced bacterial membrane permeabilization as determined by \u03b2-galactosidase activity on  Escherichia coli  ML35p strain. Moreover, the synergistic combination was less cytotoxic on the vero cell line compared with cinnamaldehyde alone. The results of the current study indicate that cinnamaldehyde and thymol in combination can be effective against  S. epidermidis  planktonic culture and biofilm development.",

        "abstract": "A Gram negative, yellow pigmented, rod shaped bacterium designated as RL(T) was isolated from a hot water spring (90-98 \u00b0C) located at Manikaran in Northern India. The isolate grows at 60-80 \u00b0C (optimum, 70 \u00b0C) and at pH 7.0-9.0 (optimum pH 7.2). Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences and levels of DNA-DNA relatedness together indicate that the new isolate represents a novel species of the genus Thermus with closest affinity to Thermus thermophilus HB8(T) (99.5 %) followed by Thermus arciformis (96.4 %). A comparative analysis of partial sequences of housekeeping genes (HKG) further revealed that strain RL(T) is a novel species belonging to the genus Thermus. The melting G+C content of strain RL(T) was calculated as 68.7 mol%. The DNA-DNA relatedness value of strain RL(T) with its nearest neighbours (>97 %) was found to be less than 70 % indicating that strain RL(T) represents a novel species of the genus Thermus. MK-8 was the predominant respiratory quinone. The presence of characteristic phospholipid and glycolipid further confirmed that strain RL(T) belongs to the genus Thermus. The predominant fatty acids of strain RL(T) were iso-C17:0 (23.67 %) and iso-C15:0 (24.50 %). The results obtained after DNA-DNA hybridization, biochemical and physiological tests clearly distinguished strain RL(T) from its closely related species. Thus, strain RL(T) represents a novel species of the genus Thermus for which the name Thermus parvatiensis is proposed (=DSM 21745(T)= MTCC 8932(T)).",

        "abstract": "In this study hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) contaminated soil (with HCH level 84 g/kg of soil) from HCH dumpsite (Ummari village, Lucknow, India) was used to demonstrate biostimulation approach for HCH bioremediation. Different nutrients (molasses and ammonium phosphate) were used in different pits having contaminated soil to stimulate the indigenous microbial community. There was a substantial reduction in the total HCH content of the soil in 12 months long experiment. Maximum reduction was seen in the pit that received a combination of molasses and ammonium phosphate. A change in the microbial community concomitant with degradation of HCH was observed. Sphingomonads, which are known degraders of HCH, were found to dominate the experimental pits. Moreover changes in linA and linB gene (primary genes involved in HCH degradation) diversity and number were also seen as revealed by T-RFLP and RT-PCR respectively. The study suggests the prospects of biostimulation in decontaminating soils heavily contaminated with HCH.",

        "abstract": "The Pseudomonas sp. GBS.5 cells were immobilized in calcium alginate (2%): PVA (6%) matrix and the carbazole degradation was studied after dissolving the alginate linkages. This matrix was chosen for immobilization based on mechanical stability and immobilized cell viability. The maximum carbazole degradation rate achieved by PVA-alginate immobilized cells was 52.62 ppm h-1 as opposed to 39.06 ppm h-1 by cells immobilized in calcium alginate beads. The effect of cell loading capacity and initial carbazole concentration on carbazole degradation were also studied. The cells immobilized in PVA beads could be stably stored and be repeatedly used for eight cycles at 100 ppm carbazole concentration with high degradation activity. The immobilization process described in the paper resulted in increased carbazole degradation activity and hence the decrease in the cost of operations.",

There appears to be some difference in this effect based on the type of SLT product used. These results highlight the independent deleterious effect of SLT products on the outcome of CHD and might help to resolve the long-standing controversy regarding the association of SLT with the risk of CHD. Hence, we propose that in addition to smoking, cessation efforts should be directed towards SLT products as well, for control of cardiovascular diseases.",

        "abstract": "Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) play an important role in detoxification of carcinogenic electrophiles. The null genotypes in GSTM1 and GSTT1 have been implicated in carcinogenesis. Present study was planned to evaluate the influence of genetic polymorphisms of GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene loci in cervical carcinogenesis. The study was conducted in Lok Nayak hospital, New Delhi. DNA from clinical scrapes of 482 women with minor gynaecologic complaints attending Gynaecology OPD and tumor biopsies of 135 cervical cancer cases attending the cancer clinic was extracted. HPV DNA was detected by standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using L1 consensus primer pair. Polymorphisms of GSTM1 and GSTT1 were analysed by multiplex PCR procedures. Differences in proportions were tested using Pearson's Chi-square test with Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The risk of cervical cancer was almost three times in women with GSTM1 homozygous null genotype (OR-2.62, 95%CI, 1.77-3.88; p<0.0001). No association of GSTM1 or GSTT1 homozygous null genotypes was observed in women with normal, precancerous and cervical cancerous lesions among \u226435 or >35 years of age groups. Smokers with null GSTT1 genotype had a higher risk of cervical cancer as compared to non-smokers (OR-3.01, 95% CI, 1.10-8.23; p=0.03). The results further showed that a significant increased risk of cervical cancer was observed in HPV positive smoker women with GSTT1 (OR-4.36, 95% CI, 1.27-15.03; p=0.02) and GSTM1T1 (OR-3.87, 95% CI, 1.05-14.23; p=0.04) homozygous null genotypes as compared to HPV positive non smokers. The results demonstrate that the GST null genotypes were alone not associated with the development of cervical cancer, but interacted with smoking and HPV to exert effects in our Delhi population. ",

        "abstract": "Objectives: To determine associations, if any, of bacterial vaginosis with cervical pre-neoplastic lesions and evaluate\nany effects of sub-categorization of smears with bacterial vaginosis. Methods: All cervico-vaginal smears reported as\npositive for bacterial vaginosis over a five-year period were reviewed and sub-categorized into \u2018type I (dysbacteriosis)\u2019\nand \u2018type II (pure Gardenerella infection)\u2019 smears by two cytopathologists (PS, SG). The proportion of smears with\nhealthy flora and pre-neoplastic lesions was compared with those having bacterial vaginosis in conjunction with such\nchanges. In addition, a comparison was also attempted between the frequencies of pre-neoplastic lesions with the two\ncategories of bacterial vaginosis smears. Results: Bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed in 28.6% (7017 of the 24,565)\nof the 24,565 smears received in the Institute during the study period. Of these 7,017 smears with bacterial vaginosis,\n53% (3717) were categorized as type I and 42.7% (3000) as type II by both cytopathologists. Pre-neoplastic lesions\nwere detected in 10.2% of smears with bacterial vaginosis compared to 5.7% of those with healthy flora (P<0.0001).\nOf the sub-categories of bacterial vaginosis, the risk of detecting precancerous lesion was higher for type II smears\n(P<0.001). Conclusion: Sub-categorization of bacterial vaginosis, as performed in the Dutch coding system, may be\nworthwhile due to the strikingly different risk of associated preneoplasia.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: India fights massive cervical cancer burden. This article highlights an innovative feasible approach\nenabling tertiary hospitals to contribute to cancer prevention without compromising their primary mandate to provide\ntreatment. Methodology: Since 1979, National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research (NICPR) support a tertiary\nhospital in cervical cancer screening through a satellite clinic. Record review of 5328 attendees of this clinic between\nJanuary-December 2016 was done. Pap-smear testing and reporting were performed by trained NICPR personnel. Patients\u2019\ndemographics, reproductive history, Pap-test date, cytology results were recorded and results were communicated to\nrespective units for further management. Results: Among 5328 women screened, 2% (96/5328) had abnormal cytology,\nwhich included malignancy(33%; 32/96), Atypical Squamous Cells-Undetermined Significance(ASC-US) (20%;\n19/96), Atypical Glandular Cells(AGC) (23%; 22/96) with complaints of pain in lower abdomen 65.6%(59/90), white\ndischarge per vaginum 46.7%(42/90) and backache 23.3%(21/90). In which, Muslims- 67% (65/96), illiterates- 58%\n(56/96). Age>35(p<0.001), parity>3(p<0.05), illiteracy (p<0.05), Muslim women (p<0.05) had positive association with\nabnormal cytology. Conclusion: Awareness about cervical cancer screening is the immediate need in resource-limited\ncountries. Government hospitals in such countries should house dedicated preventive oncology unit for cancer screening.",

        "abstract": "Tobacco use among school children is becoming a serious problem in developing countries. The early age of initiation underscores the urgent need to intervene and protect this vulnerable group from falling prey to this addiction. The present study was thus undertaken to assess the prevalence of tobacco habits among school children, determine the age of initiation of these habits, and compare the age of initiation between students who were more than 15 and \u2264 15 yr of age.Data on tobacco use were collected from 4786 students of class 7 to 12 (age: 11-19 yr) studying in different private and government schools of Noida city during July- December 2005, through cluster and random sampling using a self-administered questionnaire.Any kind of tobacco use was found in 537 (11.2%) students; 419 (8.8%) were 'ever smokers (including current smokers)' 219 (4.6%) were 'ever tobacco chewers (including current chewers)', 179 (3.7%) were 'exclusive smokers' and 118 (2.5%) were 'exclusive tobacco chewers'. The mean age of initiation of these habits was around 12.4 yr. More than 50 per cent of tobacco chewers reported use of khaini at least once. Nearly 70 per cent of boys and 80 per cent of girls \u2264 15 yr initiated the habit of tobacco before the age of 11 yr. A significant early uptake of tobacco chewing was reported from private school students as compared to government school students (P<0.05).Tobacco addiction is emerging as a big threat among children. Our findings indicate a recent downward shift in the age at initiation of tobacco uptake and rising prevalence among girls. Such data need to be collected from different parts of the country to develop anti-tobacco campaigns and take policy decision.",

This tumor has a low rate of local recurrence and no risk of malignant behavior. Although histological features of SCL are well documented, cytological descriptions have been few. We present the case of a 41-year man with a right arm swelling, which on fine-needle aspiration cytology showed adipose tissue fragments, spindle cell areas mimicking benign nerve sheath tumor, and bundles of ropy collagen in a myxoid background, suggesting a diagnosis of SCL. SCL with predominant spindle cell component may mimic benign nerve sheath tumor on aspiration cytology. Subtle cytological features like presence of adipose tissue, ropy collagen, and mast cells help in accurate diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Purpose To compare the ability of margin classification systems to determine local recurrence (LR) risk after soft tissue sarcoma (STS) resection. Methods Two thousand two hundred seventeen patients with nonmetastatic extremity and truncal STS treated with surgical resection and multidisciplinary consideration of perioperative radiotherapy were retrospectively reviewed. Margins were coded by residual tumor (R) classification (in which microscopic tumor at inked margin defines R1), the R+1mm classification (in which microscopic tumor within 1 mm of ink defines R1), and the Toronto Margin Context Classification (TMCC; in which positive margins are separated into planned close but positive at critical structures, positive after whoops re-excision, and inadvertent positive margins). Multivariate competing risk regression models were created. Results By R classification, LR rates at 10-year follow-up were 8%, 21%, and 44% in R0, R1, and R2, respectively. R+1mm classification resulted in increased R1 margins (726 v 278, P < .001), but led to decreased LR for R1 margins without changing R0 LR; for R0, the 10-year LR rate was 8% (range, 7% to 10%); for R1, the 10-year LR rate was 12% (10% to 15%) . The TMCC also showed various LR rates among its tiers ( P < .001). LR rates for positive margins on critical structures were not different from R0 at 10 years (11% v 8%, P = .18), whereas inadvertent positive margins had high LR (5-year, 28% [95% CI, 19% to 37%]; 10-year, 35% [95% CI, 25% to 46%]; P < .001). Conclusion The R classification identified three distinct risk levels for LR in STS. An R+1mm classification reduced LR differences between R1 and R0, suggesting that a negative but < 1-mm margin may be adequate with multidisciplinary treatment. The TMCC provides additional stratification of positive margins that may aid in surgical planning and patient education.",

        "abstract": "Secretory phospholipase A2 Group-IIA (sPLA2 -IIA) catalyzes the hydrolysis of the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids to yield fatty acids and lysophospholipids. sPLA2 -IIA is deregulated in various cancers; however, its role in hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) regulation is obscure. Here we report a transgenic mice overexpressing sPLA2 -IIA (K14-sPLA2 -IIA) showed depletion of HFSC pool. This was accompanied with increased differentiation, loss of ortho-parakeratotic organization and enlargement of sebaceous gland, infundibulum and junctional zone. The colony forming efficiency of keratinocytes was significantly reduced. Microarray profiling of HFSCs revealed enhanced level of epithelial mitogens and transcription factors, c-Jun and FosB that may be involved in proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, K14-sPLA2 -IIA keratinocytes showed enhanced activation of EGFR and JNK1/2 that led to c-Jun activation, which co-related with enhanced differentiation. Further, depletion of stem cells in bulge is associated with high levels of chromatin silencing mark, H3K27me3 and low levels of an activator mark, H3K9ac suggestive of alteration in gene expression contributing toward stem cells differentiation. Our results, first time uncovered that overexpression of sPLA2 -IIA lead to depletion of HFSCs and differentiation associated with altered histone modification. Thus involvement of sPLA2 -IIA in stem cells regulation and disease pathogenesis suggest its prospective clinical implications. Stem Cells 2016;34:2407-2417. ",

        "abstract": "Aberrant changes in histone post-translational modifications are encountered frequently in diseases like cancer. Although histone H3 post-translational modifications have been extensively studied in context of diseases, the functionally important histone H2A PTM H2A119ub (H2Aub) has not gained much attention. In this study, we report that H2Aub markedly decreases in hepatocellular carcinoma. Usp21, a H2A deubiquitinase, is probably responsible for decrease in H2Aub. In addition, the H2Aub levels showed an inverse correlation with H3S10 phosphorylation (H3S10p) and the proliferative state of the cells. Downregulation of H2Aub is also associated with increased expression of growth factor gene lipocalin 2. Interestingly, we show that treatment of cells with histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A results in increase of H2Aub and decrease in H3S10p. Our work for the first time suggests the in\u00a0vivo association of H3S10p, H4ac, and H2A119ub with cellular transformation.",

        "abstract": "Epigenetics have witnessed a renewed interest over the past decade and assays with recombinant histones has become an important tool for uncovering various aspects of histone biology. However, at times absence of recombinant histone accumulation in bacteria is encountered which is also commonly observed for many eukaryotic proteins in general. In this study, we have investigated the effect of multiple parameters on heterologous expression of proteins. We show that there is marked variability in the accumulation of H2A.2, H2B.1, H3.2 and H4 in the recombinant host, possibly owing to translational variability and degradation by the host proteases. We found that the variability could be overcome by incorporation of the commonly used purification tags, like GST or MBP, of appropriate size and position. Our results provide compelling evidence that transcript parameters like rare codon and GC content, mRNA secondary structure etc. together modulate translation kinetics and govern recombinant protein accumulation.",

Although, the production ofsuch complexes has been described earlier but still it remains a challenge for a non-specialist lab.Here we describe a protocol to quickly obtain large quantities of highly pure histones using bacterialexpression system for GST pull-down and reconstitution experiments. In addition, we describemethods to quickly reconstitute and purify H2A/H2B dimers, H3/H4 tetramers and histoneoctamers for in vitro experiments. We demonstrate that these sub-complexes are properly foldedand are hence, true representatives of the actual substrates in vivo. We also show that histoneshave a propensity to be non-specifically cleaved by proteases. Our results suggest that TEV proteaseis the most suitable protease while working with histones. The methodology described hereshould allow researchers to purify histone complexes in three days enabling functional and structuralanalyses of histone variants, mutants and post-translational modifications.",

        "abstract": "Evenly spaced conductive grids of copper and aluminum thin films on polyimide substrate are used for parabolic reflector antennas aboard telecommunications satellites. Laser microscribing of thin films using a flat-top and Gaussian laser beam profile is analyzed with 95% overlapping of the diameter of the laser spot. Laser scribing is performed using the Q-switched  Nd 3+ :\u2009\u2009YAG  (355, 532 nm) laser. The influence of laser irradiation and beam shape on the scribed microchannel width, depth, and surface characteristics is experimentally analyzed using a noncontact optical profilometer and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Laser scribing using a flat-top profile produced near rectangular microchannels in copper thin films. Using the Gaussian profile, the probability of melting is greater than vaporization as observed using SEM images; this melt pool plays a prominent role in resolidification at the edges. The depth of the scribe channel is observed to be 20% higher for the 532-nm wavelength compared to the 355-nm wavelength. The effect of different environments such as air, water, and vacuum on the channel depth and quality is reported. The response of aluminum and copper thin films for high fluences is also studied. Thermal modeling of the laser-material interaction has been attempted by assuming the plasma electron temperature as the laser ablation temperature for modeling the recession rate and depth for a single laser pulse. Model results agree with experimental data showing greater depth for 532 nm compared to 355 nm.",

Record of vital events like death constitutes an important component of the health information system. This study was conducted to find out the causes of mortality of inpatients in tertiary care hospital admitted during 2007-2011. Methodology: A retrospective analysis was conducted with medical record department in tertiary care hospital of Bhopal over a 5 years period. Death was classified using a standard system of ICD-10 (international classification of diseases). Results: Total 1619 death more 24% (723) were in the group of 45 years and above followed by 16-30 years of age 21% (336). Males were more (56%) than females (44%). The leading cause of death in last five years was septicaemia (24%), followed by heart diseases (14.63%) and pulmonary tuberculosis (10.31%). Least common cause of mortality was poisoning 2.1% and cancer 2.4%. Conclusion: Most common cause of overall mortality was septicaemia, cardiac and pulmonary disease. Steps are needed to be taken to educate the people and also to provide better treatment facilities at grass root level. An urgent reorientation of the health delivery system is required to enable the implementation of evidence-based strategies that can address this new challenge of non-communicable conditions.",

        "abstract": "Every man derives the happiness and benefit of his life through locomotion i.e., using his joints. For the minute if he loses this power of locomotion he not only feels himself a miserable creature but also becomes a burden both of his family and society. The loss or reduction in his locomotive power is due to dysfunction of the joints causing an impediment to his movements. If not treated in time, the disease makes man disable.  Sandhigata Vata  is most common articular disorder. It is a type of  Vata Vyadhi  which mainly occurs in  Vriddhavastha,  due to  Dhatukshaya .  Sandhigata Vata  can be correlated with osteoarthritis (OA) which is one such chronic, degenerative, inflammatory disease and has a great impact on the quality of the life of an individual. Different modalities of treatment have been explained in the classics to tackle the condition effectively. The present study was aimed to assess clinically the effect of  Upanaha Sweda  and  Vatari Guggulu  in the management of  Janusandhigata   Vata . In this study total 42 patients were divided in 2 groups. In Group A, patients were treated with only  Upanaha Sweda  and other group patients were treated with Upanaha Sweda and Vatari Guggulu. Results obtained were analyzed for statistical significance which shows group B in which  Vatari Guggulu  and  Upanaha Sweda  were given, was more effective in bringing relief in signs and symptoms of  Janusandhigata Vata.",

It influences socioeconomic and cultural status of country due to its contribution in morbidity and mortality. As kerosene is widely used as household energy source in India at rural areas as well as urban, it accounts for significant number of poisoning cases mainly accidental in manner. As there are only handful studies from India on kerosene poisoning in children, we planned this study to evaluate incidence of kerosene poisoning in Western Indian population and its clinico-epidemiotoxicological profile. In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we collected data of all the cases of kerosene poisoning diagnosed during five years from 2009 to 2013 at Shri Krishna hospital situated at Karamsad, Gujarat state of Western India. We observed among total 42 cases, all victims were under 3 years of age. Evening in summer months, rural areas, storage of kerosene in household containers, inadequate parental supervision and door-to-hospitalization period emerged as most serious associated factors. Fever, cough, vomiting, tachypnoea and leucocytosis were commonest manifestations while pneumonia was the most common complication. Signs of central nervous system involvement, leucocytosis and vomiting were significantly correlated with pneumonia. Deaths occurred due to pneumonia. Early diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia may reduce mortality and recommendations are made to reduce the incidence of kerosene poisoning.",

        "abstract": "Poisoning is recognized as a major factor for deaths in majority of low-income and middle-income countries. Although it is considered as a global burden, the nature of poisoning may vary in different areas across the world. The Charutar region in the state of Gujarat in western India has a unique topography and cultivation practises which sets it apart from the rest of the state. Due to the dearth of studies pertaining to the access of the population at this area to different types of poisons and pattern of poisoning, we planned this study to find magnitude, morbidity and mortality of poisoning with a specific consideration of gender, age and poison in contrast to the usual adopted cumulative approach. In a retrospective study, 1092 cases were identified as poisoning cases. The study revealed a higher vulnerability to poisoning in males, married individuals, during the third decade of life, from rural areas, due to accidental causes, during day time events and during the monsoon seasons. The gender specific approach clarified additional comparative data. More deaths were reported from suicidal poisoning than accidental ones. 49 specific poisons were found in the study, among which accidental snake bite poisoning, insecticidal substances and aluminium phosphide were prevalent. Aluminium phosphide and quinalphos were responsible for the highest fatalities (in terms of number of persons died). Gender predominance was observed for specific poisons. Age wise distribution of specific poisons was derived. Treatment duration and survival period for specific poisons were calculated.",

The authors sought to determine which neuropsychiatric symptoms predict relapse.Method:In the Antipsychotic Discontinuation in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease trial, 180 patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and symptoms of agitation or psychosis were treated with risperidone for 16 weeks, after which patients who responded (N=110) were randomly assigned to continue risperidone for 32 weeks, to continue risperidone for 16 weeks followed by switch to placebo for 16 weeks, or to receive placebo for 32 weeks. As reported previously, discontinuation of risperidone was associated with a two- to fourfold increased risk of relapse over 16\u201332 weeks.

We have used chemosaturation percutaneous hepatic perfusion (PHP) to isolate the liver blood supply and deliver very high doses of melphalan to the liver. Previously, this has been reported to improve median hepatic progression free survival in a phase III study in metastatic UM but at the cost of significant mortality. We present our results of a large single centre experience of the treatment of UM using PHP in carefully selected patients. Methods: We analysed 22 consecutive patients (pts) (8 males; median age 51) who were planned for PHP treatment over a 30 month period. All were staged with contrast enhanced MRI, CT scan and laparoscopy with histological tumour confirmation. Data were collected for adverse events (AE), rates of survival, response and time to progression. Results: 2 pts could not...",

In a clinical trial program, CS-PHP with melphalan significantly improved hepatic progression-free survival in patients with unresectable hepatic metastases from ocular or cutaneous melanoma. Clinically meaningful hepatic responses were also observed in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or neuroendocrine tumors. Furthermore, the results of published studies and case reports demonstrated that CS-PHP with melphalan resulted in favorable tumor response rates in a range of tumor histologies (ocular or cutaneous melanoma, colorectal cancer, and hepatobiliary tumors). Analyses of the safety profile of CS-PHP revealed that the most common adverse effects were hematologic events (thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia), which were clinically manageable. Taken together, these findings indicate that CS-PHP is a promising locoregional therapy for patients with primary and secondary liver tumors and has a acceptable safety profile.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This paper investigates the modification effect of nanosilica and ureolytic/non-ureolytic bacteria at the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) of RA and recycled aggregate concrete (RAC).The improved RA showed reduction in water absorption (43% in non-ureolytic bacteria, 64% in ureolytic bacteria and 21% in nano modified RA) and increase in specific gravity (\u223c29% in non-ureolytic bacteria, 30% in ureolytic bacteria and 18% in nano modified RA). The studies also proved that properties of RA and RAC on the macroscale were highly improved by the soaking approach than the direct mixing approach. ITZ studies were carried out using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis, which revealed that, biogenic calcite and nano mediated accelerated hydration products densified both the ITZs (old and new), leading to substantial improvement in macroproperties of RAC. Thus, the proposed modification techniques, seems promising for the performance enhancement of recycled aggregate.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of biomineralization in concrete by incorporation of ureolytic sp. ( B. megaterium ,  B. pasteurii ) in the absence of substrate and non-ureolytic sp. ( B. cohnii ) without chemical feed. The related pathway accountable for durability enhancement besides well known, microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) was explored. The explored pathway of mineralization resulted in enhancement of mechanical properties, reduction in water absorption (\u223c22%), volume of voids (\u223c24%) and sulphate ion concentration at 180\u202fdays (\u223c26%). Field emission scanning electron microscopy revealed thick mineral deposition (microstructural modification) by bacteria at interfacial transition zone (ITZ) with Ca/Si\u202f=\u202f1.5. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results showed an accelerated formation of hydrated products in the presence of bacteria. Quantification by thermogravimetric analysis, exhibited \u223c16% higher calcium silicate hydrate and \u223c37% more calcium hydroxide formation in bacterial concrete. The additional formation of hydration products facilitated by bacteria, is believed to be the definite reason of densified microstructure and thus, enhanced macro properties of bacterial concrete.",

        "abstract": "An increase in tumour formation and metastasis are observed upon plakophilin3 (PKP3) loss. To identify pathways downstream of PKP3 loss that are required for increased tumour formation, a gene expression analysis was performed, which demonstrated that the expression of lipocalin2 (LCN2) was elevated upon PKP3 loss and this is consistent with expression data from human tumour samples suggesting that PKP3 loss correlates with an increase in LCN2 expression. PKP3 loss leads to an increase in invasion, tumour formation and metastasis and these phenotypes were dependent on the increase in LCN2 expression. The increased LCN2 expression was due to an increase in the activation of p38 MAPK in the HCT116 derived PKP3 knockdown clones as LCN2 expression decreased upon inhibition of p38 MAPK. The phosphorylated active form of p38 MAPK is translocated to the nucleus upon PKP3 loss and is dependent on complex formation between p38 MAPK and PKP3. WT PKP3 inhibits LCN2 reporter activity in PKP3 knockdown cells but a PKP3 mutant that fails to form a complex with p38 MAPK cannot supress LCN2 promoter activity. Further, LCN2 expression is decreased upon loss of p38\u03b2, but not p38\u03b1, in the PKP3 knockdown cells. These results suggest that PKP3 loss leads to an increase in the nuclear translocation of p38 MAPK and p38\u03b2 MAPK is required for the increase in LCN2 expression.",

The starch synthase enzyme is characterized using three domains (Glyco_transf_5, Glycos_transf_1 and Glyco_trans_1_4). Binding sites for GLC (alpha-d-glucose), PLP (Pyridoxal-5'- phosphate), AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GOL (Glycerol) are found.

        "abstract": "Starch-branching enzymes (SBEs) are one of the four major enzyme classes involved in starch biosynthesis in plants and play an important role in determining the structure and physical properties of starch granules. Multiple SBEs are involved in starch biosynthesis in plants. Finger millet is calcium rich important serial crop belongs to grass family and the transcriptome data of developing spikes is available on NCBI. In this study it was try to find out the gene sequence of starch branching enzyme and annotate the sequence and submit the sequence for further use. Rice SBE sequence was taken as reference and for characterization of the sequence different in silico tools were used. Four domains were found in the finger millet Starch branching enzyme like alpha amylase catalytic domain from 925 to2172 with E value 0, N-terminal Early set domain from 634 to 915 with E value 1.62 e-42, Alpha amylase, C-terminal all-beta domain from 2224 to 2511 with E value 5.80e-24 and 1,4-alpha-glucan-branching enzyme from 421 to 2517 with E value 0. Major binding interactions with the GLC (alpha-d-glucose), CA (calcium ion), GOL (glycerol), TRS (2-amino-2-hydroxymethylpropane- 1, 3-diol), MG (magnesium ion) and FLC (citrate anion) are fond with different residues. It was found in the phylogenetic study of the finger millet SBE with the 6 species of grass family that two clusters were form A and B. In cluster A, finger millet showed closeness with Oryzasativa and Setariaitalica, Sorghum bicolour and Zea mays while cluster B was formed with Triticumaestivum and Brachypodium distachyon. The nucleotide sequence of Finger millet SBE was submitted to NCBI with the accession no KY648913 and protein structure of SBE of finger millet was also submitted in PMDB with the PMDB id - PM0080938. This research presents a comparative overview of Finger millet SBE and includes their properties, structural and functional characteristics, and recent developments on their post-translational regulation.",

        "abstract": "Of several subtypes of breast cancer, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive tumor that lacks expression of hormone receptors for estrogen, progesterone and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and shows a worst prognosis. The small noncoding RNAs (miRNAs) considered as master regulator of gene expression play a key role in cancer initiation, progression and drug resistance and have emerged as attractive molecular biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment targets in cancer. We have done expression profiling of selected miRNAs in paired serum and tissue samples of TNBC patients and corresponding cell lines and compared with that of other subtypes, in order to identify novel serum miRNA biomarkers for early detection and progression of TNBC. A total of 85 paired tumor tissues and sera with an equal number of adjacent normal tissue margins and normal sera from age matched healthy women including tissue and sera samples from 15 benign fibroadenomas were employed for the study. We report for the first time an extremely high prevalence (73.9%) of TNBC in premenopausal women below 35 years of age and a significant altered expression of a panel of three specific oncogenic miRNAs- miR-21, miR-221, miR-210, and three tumor suppressor miRNAs- miR-195, miR-145 and Let-7a in both tissues and corresponding sera of TNBC patients when compared with triple positive breast cancer (TPBC) patients. While miR-21, miR-221 and miR-210 showed significant over-expression, miR-195 and miR-145 were downregulated and well correlated with various clinicopathological and demographic risk factors, tumor grade, clinical stage and hormone receptor status. Interestingly, despite being a known tumor suppressor, Let-7a showed a significant overexpression in TNBCs. It is suggested that this panel of six miRNA signature may serve as a minimally invasive biomarker for an early detection of TNBC patients. ",

The implication of climate change resulted into rising sea level, changes of pattern in coastal landscape, missing seasonal rainfall, tsunami etc. Rising of temperature is one such impact which affects the marine fisheries. The marine fishes are drifted from their conventional ocean zone into different places because of the absence of favorable environment. In Indian Ocean (IO), the seasonal catchments of customary fishes like sardine, pelagic and demersal are reduced due to the aberrant pattern of climate change. If the trend is continue, the problem of lack of catchment, over fishing is to be happened in the near future. This paper presents the details of these conventional fishes and analyse their decline in catchment due to climate change. Furthermore, the historical data of these fish catchment is taken for predicting the future trend. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is employed for predicting the nature of these fishes. The system is tested with the available datasets and the test result shows the efficiency of the proposed system.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to analyse preoperatively with ultrasound the minimum volume of buccal fat that would be required for interposition of a pad after gap arthroplasty, and to emphasise the value of such a pad in the management of ankylosis of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) during a short term follow up. Nineteen patients with ankylosis of the TMJ (22 joints) were selected, whose mean (SD) mouth opening was 4.9 (3.7) mm. In 10 joints in which the mean (SD) volume of the buccal fat pad was 0.7 (0.2) ml, the harvested buccal fat was inadequate for interposition, so they were treated with other materials. The remaining 12 joints had a mean (SD) volume of 1.1 (0.3) ml, which gave enough fat for interposition after gap arthroplasty. Investigation with ultrasound at 15 days and 6 months postoperatively showed that the fat pad was viable and the volume had shrunk by 28%. The 6-month postoperative computed tomographic (CT) scan showed little or no heterotopic calcification. We conclude that a buccal fat pad with a preoperative mean (SD) volume of 1.1 (0.3) ml is easy to harvest as interposition material. At a mean follow up of the 12 joints after 31 (range 24-36) months there was progressive improvement in mouth opening with a mean (SD) of 32.5 (5.0) mm, which established that a pedicled buccal fat pad is a stable, efficient, viable soft tissue barrier in the management of ankylosis of the TMJ.",

We propose a new multicast routing algorithm called maximum mean number of new calls accepted before blocking multicast routing (MCBMR), which can more accurately reflect the current and future loading of a network. Simulation results show that this algorithm, compared with LLMR, not only has a smaller network revenue loss, but also results in smaller call blocking probabilities for all classes of traffic",
