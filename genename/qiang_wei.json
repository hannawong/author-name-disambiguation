The anodic polarization curve and polarization resistance of these alloys were analyzed and the element release of Ti-12.5Zr-3Nb-2.5Sn and Ti-6Al-4V alloy after immersion in artificial saliva for 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 15 d were measured.polarization curve indicated that Ti-6Al-4V alloy had lower breakdown potential (0.8 V) than Ti-12.5Zr-3Nb-2.5Sn alloy did (> 2.5 V). Ti-6Al-4V alloy showed higher passivation current density (1.45 \u00d7 10(-4) - 1.09 \u00d7 10(-3) A/cm(2)) than Ti-12.5Zr-3Nb-2.5Sn alloy (3.32 \u00d7 10(-6) - 3.46 \u00d7 10(-5) A/cm(2)) and TA2(5.03 \u00d7 10(-6) - 2.65 \u00d7 10(-5) A/cm(2)) did. Polarization resistance results showed that polarization resistance volume of TA2, Ti-12.5Zr-3Nb-2.5Sn alloy and Ti-6Al-4V alloy were 371.0, 252.0, and 60.1 k\u03a9\u00d7cm(2) respectively. With the increasing of dipping time in artificial saliva, the ion release of Ti-12.5Zr-3Nb-2.5Sn alloy and Ti-6Al-4V alloy increased to different degrees. Ti-6Al-4V alloy always showed more ion release than Ti-12.5Zr-3Nb-2.5Sn alloy did in the experiment.data from this study indicated that Ti-12.5Zr-3Nb-2.5Sn alloy, as a dental restoration material, had good corrosion resistance in artificial saliva.",

The immunoisolated effects of the composite membranes were examined by permeation experiment.The results showed that the TiO2/porous Ti composite membranes,which were dip-coated more than three times,could be inhibited the passage of immunoglobulin and immune cells.At the same time,the small molecule substances(for example,glucose) were able to pass freely through the composite membrane by diffusion.These results indicated that the composite membranes could be applied to immunoisolation,and have a good immunoisolation effect.",

In this paper, the alloy system of Ti-18Nb-17Zr-xSn (wt%, x=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) was studied. Microstructure was transformed through heat treatment. The phases were analyzed through XRD. And hardness test was also involved. The results showed that the addition of Sn could contribute to the formation of \u03b1\u2033 under high-speed cooling condition, and that it could stabilize \u03b2 together with other \u03b2 stabilizers under the low-speed cooling condition. The influence of Sn on mechanical properties was due to both solution hardening and its effect on microstructures.",

Serum levels of soluble cluster of differentiation 44 splice variant 6 (sCD44v6), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), and soluble epithelial cadherin (sE-cadherin) were determined independently by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) preoperatively, and on postoperative days 1 and 5. In addition, follow-up results were compared.On postoperative day 1, sCD44v6, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 levels increased significantly compared with preoperative levels in both groups (P<0.05). sE-cadherin levels decreased compared with preoperative levels in both groups without statistically significant differences (P>0.05). sCD44v6 levels in the retro-laparoscopy group were significantly higher than in the open group (P<0.05), while sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, and sE-cadherin levels showed no statistically significant differences between both groups (P>0.05). On postoperative day 5, all parameters in both groups were similar to preoperative values (P>0.05). Follow-up ranged from 7 to 18 months postoperatively in all 62 patients, with a 100% cancer-specific survival rate in each group.Although postoperatively higher serum concentrations of CAMs in both groups and significantly elevated sCD44v6 in the retro-laparoscopy group may be facilitated, the differences in CAMs between both groups are small and transient. Together with the similar follow-up results, this further supports previous studies that failed to show a difference in the oncologic outcomes between open and laparoscopic radical nephrectomy and provides a probable molecular mechanism.",

Basic information, clinical history, physical examination, laboratory investigations, abdominal ultrasound and enhanced computed tomography were detailed noted. Cysts with different surgical management were analyzed and surgery option, operative time, postoperative complications and after-surgery hospital stay were all noted. The final diagnosis was judged by histopathology. Patients were followed from 3 month to 10 years.All the 47 patients with a mean age of 43.8 years were managed by surgical intervention. Compared laparoscopic technology with open technology, the laparoscopic has the advantage of a shorter operation time, shorter hospital stay after surgery and enhanced cosmesis. The histopathologic result was: 23 (50%) were endothelial cysts and 16 (35%) were pseudocysts. One patient had evidence to recurrence at the followed-up stage.Adrenal cysts are rare and with the development of imaging techniques many of these are diagnosed incidentally. CT has advantages in detecting the cysts with haemorrhage, intracystic debris, calcification and mixed adrenal mass. Minimally invasive surgery offers equivalent efficacy to traditional open procedures, while providing a shorter operation time, shorter convalescence and improved cosmesis. Patients after surgical resection should be followed up closely especially if functional cysts and histopathology of cystic tumor are present.",

RVD is not a rare congenital anomaly in urology as many cases with vascular deformity have been reported.However, no case has been reported with unilateral kidney almost in the normal position, but with several different branches of ectopic arteries-one even receiving the arterial supply from the contralateral iliac artery-and ectopic veins, one of which forms a collateral circulation with the portal vein. Moreover, it is quite interesting that this case of RVD is combined with another abnormality-duplex pelvis and renal malrotation. We will present this extremely rare case of multiple malformation of the right renal vascular deformity combined with duplex pelvis and malrotation.",

        "abstract": "Prostate inflammation (PI) is closely related to the development and progression of chronic prostatic diseases: benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 has been reported to be associated with inflammatory diseases, such as infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancers. Meanwhile, TLR10, which can form heterodimers with TLR2, has been considered an orphan receptor without an exact function. The present study therefore aims to examine the effects of TLR2 and TLR10 on PI. Prostate samples and clinical data were obtained from the patients diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia. The inflammatory cell model was established by adding lipopolysaccharide to RWPE-1 cells. Prostate tissues/cells were examined by histological, molecular, and biochemical approaches. Both TLR2 and TLR10 were found to be expressed in prostate tissues and RWPE-1 cells. mRNA/protein expression levels of TLR2 and TLR10 were both positively correlated with prostate tissue inflammatory grades. Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RWPE-1 cells expressed higher levels of TLR2, TLR10, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), phospho-nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells P65 (phospho-NF-\u03baB P65), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8 than control cells. Moreover, HMGB1, phospho-NF-\u03baB P65, IL-6, and IL-8 were downregulated after TLR2 knockdown and upregulated after TLR10 knockdown in RWPE-1 cells. TLR2 stimulation can activate the inflammatory signaling cascade in prostate epithelial cells. Conversely, TLR10 exhibited suppressive effects on inflammation. With antagonistic functions, both TLR2 and TLR10 were involved in PI. TLR10 could be a novel target in modulating inflammatory signal transduction of prostate epithelial cells.",

The goal of this meta-analysis was to provide more information about the efficacy and safety of dapoxetine in patients with PE.We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing dapoxetine with a placebo in patients with PE. Relevant eligible RCTs were identified through comprehensive searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, and PubMed. Efficacy (intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT), patient global impression of change, perceived control over ejaculation, and satisfaction with sexual intercourse) and safety (treatment-emergent adverse events and discontinuation rates) were studied by using Review Manager version 5.1.0.Six RCTs involving 5934 patients met the inclusion criteria. The main outcome (IELT) in the dapoxetine group was improved significantly compared with IELT in the placebo group (mean difference, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.30 to 1.88]; P &amp;lt; 0.00001). The 60-mg dose of dapoxetine was more beneficial than the 30-mg dose for IELT (mean difference, -0.47 [95 % CI, -0.73 to -0.20]; P = 0.0005). Although the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events in the dapoxetine group was nearly twice that in the placebo group (50.5% vs 27.9%), reports of severe adverse events were rare.Data from the meta-analysis revealed that treatment with dapoxetine was significantly efficacious in patients with PE. Although adverse events such as nausea, dizziness, diarrhea, insomnia, and headache were common, dapoxetine's overall safety profile was acceptable.",

We aimed to compare the stone expulsion rates and adverse effects associated with the use of nifedipine or tamsulosin as medical expulsive therapy (MET) for the management of lower ureteral stones (LUS) without extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) via a literature review and meta-analysis. Relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from the Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar databases. Finally, a total of 7 RCTs with 3897 patients were included. Our meta-analysis showed that tamsulosin could significantly increase the stone expulsion rate relative to nifedipine in patients with LUS (random-effects model; risk ratio [RR] = 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.75-0.88; P < 0.00001). The subgroup analysis indicated no statistically significant difference between the drugs with regard to minor or major adverse effects (fixed-effect model; RR = 1.19, 95% CI = 0.91-1.54, P = 0.20; and RR = 1.63, 95% CI = 0.22-11.82, P = 0.63, respectively). This meta-analysis demonstrated that tamsulosin was more effective than nifedipine in patients with LUS, as evidenced by the higher stone expulsion rate. Tamsulosin treatment should therefore be considered for patients with LUS.",

We divided the first and last 20 patients into group I and group II. There was no statistical difference in stone size between groups. Operative time and complications were measured as a basis for the assessment of the learning curve.In group I, the complication rate was 15% (3/20), including two patients whose procedure was converted to open surgery because of intraoperative bleeding, and one patient who experienced urine leakage because of a displaced Double-J ureteral stent. In group II, no postoperative complications occurred, while the mean operative time was significantly shorter compared with the earlier operations (65 vs 120 min).Retroperitoneal laparoscopic ureterolithotomy is safe and effective for large or impacted stones of the upper ureter. It is associated with a short learning curve in the setting of an active laparoscopic practice for selected patients.",

Methods The HE stained slice obtained by prostate biopsy from 143 BPH and 106 PCa were reviewed to determine whether the tissue inflammation existed. According to the histological classification of prostatic tissue inflammation, the features of tissue inflammation and the differences of these features between the two groups were studied in detail. Results There were 142 cases found tissue inflammation in 143 BPH patients and 104 cases in 106 PCa patients, so the incidences of tissue inflammation in BPH and PCa were 99.3% and 98.1% respectively. The anatomical location of inflammation was significant difference between BPH and PCa group (P<0. 05). The peri-glandular inflammation (56.3%) was primary in BPH, and interstitial inflammation (56.7%) was the main pattern in PCa. The inflammation range was also significant difference between the two groups (P<0. 05). The inflammation was presented multifocally (60. 6%) in BPH, and focal lesions (51. 0%) was commonly found in PCa. Mild inflammation was most frequently observed in both groups (P>0. 05). However, there were statistically significant differences between the two groups in the degree of moderate and severe inflammation (P<0. 05). Conclusion The incidences of tissue inflammation were high in both BPH and PCa, but the pathological features of tissue inflammation were different between BPH and PCa.",

A secondary hand search was performed in relevant journals, references and the grey literature. The screening, quality assessment and data extraction of the retrieved articles were independently performed by 2 reviewers in duplicate. Studies that reported an angiomyolipoma response or adverse events after the treatment of sirolimus were included in the analysis.Four prospective nonrandomized studies involving 94 patients were included in the study. The overall response rate of angiomyolipoma was 46.8% (44 of 94) in the first year. In the second year the angiomyolipoma response rate for those patients still being treated with sirolimus was 43.5% (20 of 46) and the response rate of the patients whose sirolimus treatment was discontinued was 5% (2 of 40). The most common sirolimus related adverse reactions were stomatitis, respiratory infection, skin lesions and hyperlipidemia, while serious adverse reactions were rarely observed.This study shows that renal angiomyolipoma shrank during sirolimus therapy but tended to regrow after the therapy was stopped. In general, sirolimus is an effective and safe therapy for renal angiomyolipoma in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis.",

        "abstract": "After radical nephroureterectomy (RNU), approximately 22% to 47% of patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) develop a subsequent intravesical recurrence (IVR). Considering this high incidence of occurrence, several risk factors were reported as predictive of IVR after RNU. Until recently, most of the risk factors were still under debate. The aim of study was to conduct a meta-analysis based on the recent literature to explore the risk factors for IVR after RNU for UTUC.An electronic search of the Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, CancerLit, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases was performed to identify relevant studies published before May 2013. The studies were included if they reported risk factors related to bladder or IVR after RNU for UTUC.Overall, 40 studies, with 12,010 patients, were included in our meta-analysis. Our study indicated that a statistically significant difference in IVR after RNU was found in the male vs. female patients (odds ratio [OR] = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.59-0.85), ureteral vs. renal pelvis (OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.00-1.36), T2-4 vs. Tis, Ta, and T1 (OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.40-0.66), larger vs. smaller tumor size (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.03), and previous/synchronous bladder cancer vs. the absence of bladder cancer (OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.26-1.9). No significant differences in IVR after RNU were found in the younger vs. older age groups, multifocal tumors vs. single tumor, G3 vs. G1 and G2, high vs. low grade, N0 vs. N+, concomitant carcinoma in situ vs. the absence of carcinoma in situ, positive vs. negative lymphovascular invasion, open vs. laparoscopic nephroureterectomy, and endoscopic vs. transvesical technique.Our study showed that female patient; ureteral tumor; larger tumor; Tis, Ta, and T1; and the history of bladder cancer were significant risk factors related to IVR after RNU.",

In the present study, two extremely rare cases of adrenal Castleman's disease at our hospital are reported, and the relevant literatures were reviewed. Significant findings: A 51-year-old woman had abdominal pain for 1 month. Physical examination revealed a mass in the left abdominal. A computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the presence of the mass. Additionally, a left suprarenal mass was detected in a 56-year-old male patient during a regular medical checkup. He had no symptoms when he arrived at our hospital. The two patients underwent mass excision via a retroperitoneal laparoscopic approach. Postoperative histopathological examination of both patients' specimens suggested a diagnosis of the hyaline vascular-type of CD.These two rare cases confirm that CD can occur in the adrenal gland area. In addition, we also demonstrate that retroperitoneoscopic surgical management is effective in the treatment of the disease.",

        "abstract": "This systematic review was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tramadol in patients with premature ejaculation (PE).A systematic search of PubMed\u00ae, Embase\u00ae and the Cochrane Library was performed to identify all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of tramadol with placebo or no drug for patients with PE. The outcomes included post-therapeutic intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT), increases in IELT, satisfaction with sexual intercourse, control over ejaculation and side effects (SEs). The Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager software (RevMan 5.1.4) was used for statistical analysis.A total of 5 trials, involving 715 patients, met the inclusion criteria. The synthesized data from these RCTs indicated that compared with the control, tramadol significantly increased IELT values post-therapeutically (SMD 3.51, 95% CI 2.14-4.88, p < 0.00001) and changes in IELT values were more pronounced in the tramadol group (SMD 2.87, 95% CI 2.63-3.10, p < 0.00001). Satisfaction with sexual intercourse and the ability to control ejaculation were both improved in patients in the tramadol group (p < 0.05). The incidence of SEs in the tramadol group were significantly higher than in the control group (RR 3.55, 95% CI 1.34-9.40, p = 0.01), however most SEs were mild or moderate and transient.Tramadol may be effective in PE treatment, especially when patients have failed therapies, like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. However, the possibility of drug addiction and SEs should still be considered before initial use or after chronic use of this agent. More high-quality (clear randomization sequences, allocation concealment and blinding introduction), long-term, RCTs with a large number of PE patients are expected.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we reviewed the long-term survival outcomes, safety, and quality-of-life of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) alone versus combined with radiation therapy (RT) or chemotherapy for locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). A literature search was performed using OvidSP. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that met the following criteria were included: including locally advanced or metastatic PCa, comparing ADT alone versus combined with any treatment method and reporting quantitative data of disease control or survival outcomes. Finally, eight RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Among these, three compared ADT versus ADT plus RT (n = 2344) and one compared ADT versus ADT plus docetaxel-estramustine (n = 413) in locally advanced PCa; two compared ADT versus ADT plus docetaxel (n = 1175) and two compared ADT versus ADT plus estramustine (n = 114) in metastatic PCa. For locally advanced PCa, the addition of RT to long-term ADT can improve the outcomes of survival and tumor control with fully acceptable adverse effects. Specially, the pooled odds ratio (OR) of overall survival (OS) was 1.43 (95% confidence interval 1.20-1.71) when compared ADT plus RT with ADT alone (P < 0.0001). For metastatic hormonally sensitive PCa, the concurrent use of docetaxel plus ADT was effective and safe (pooled OR of OS: 1.29 [1.01-1.65]: P = 0.04). In all, long-term ADT plus RT and long-term ADT plus docetaxel should be considered as proper treatment option in locally advanced and metastatic hormonally sensitive PCa, respectively. The major limitation for the paper was that only eight RCTs were available.",

        "abstract": "Objectives. To investigate the efficacy and safety of perioperative endocrine therapy (PET) for patients with Cushing's syndrome (CS) undergoing retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy (RLA). Methods. The novel, simplified PET modality of 82 patients who underwent RLA procedures for CS were studied. Clinical manifestations were observed for all patients on days 1 and 5 postoperatively, and clinical data, such as blood pressure (BP), levels of serum cortisol, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), blood glucose, and electrolytes, were acquired and analyzed. Results. Supraphysiological doses of glucocorticoid were administered during the perioperative period, and the dosage was reduced gradually. In all 82 cases, the RLAs were performed successfully without any perioperative complication, such as steroid withdrawal symptoms. The patient's symptoms and signs were improved quickly and safely during the hospital days. The serum cortisol and potassium levels were rather stable on days 1 and 5 postoperatively, and most were within the normal range. The clinical manifestations, serum levels of cortisol, ACTH, and potassium in most patients restored to normal gradually after several months (mean, 6.7 \u00b1 1.2 months), except for one patient undergoing bilateral adrenalectomy. Conclusions. This perioperative endocrine therapy for patients with Cushing's syndrome (mainly for adrenocortical adenoma) undergoing retro-laparoscopic adrenalectomy is both effective and safe.",

Patients in both groups were administered three days before operation. Average bleeding quantity, bleeding index of prostate, bleeding intension, length of stay, catheter retention time, and time of washing bladder were observed and compared. Results: The average bleeding quantity, bleeding index of prostate and bleeding intension were better in the treatment group than that of the control group with significant difference (P < 0.05). The length of stay, catheter retention time and time of washing bladder had no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). No obvious adverse effect was observed in both groups. Conclusions: YunNan BaiYao capsule can effectively reduce bleeding quantity during TURP without obvious adverse effects.",

Our results showed that the onset of EAML was usually inconspicuous, and so no obvious symptoms or signs had occurred in most patients at diagnosis. Its diagnoses always depended on postoperative pathological examination. The immunohistochemical (IHC) results [HMB45 (\u2009+\u2009), cytokeratin (-), and S100 (-)] could be used to differentiate EAML from other malignancies such as renal cell cancer (RCC) and sarcomas. For treatment, surgery resulted in satisfactory short-term prognosis. The long-term prognosis of patients with EAML was poor, particularly when a large size, a high percentage of epithelioid component, tumor thrombus formation, and necrosis were present. In conclusion, EAML is a tumor with malignant potential. Once diagnosed, integrated approaches, including surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy, should be considered; a close follow-up regimen is necessary for cases that met: 1) tumor size &amp;gt;9\u2009cm, 2) tumor thrombus formation in the vein, 3) epithelioid cells &amp;gt;70% or atypia cells &amp;gt;60%, and 4) necrosis.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the value of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) examination of urine exfoliative cells in the diagnosis of urinary bladder neoplasms.The urine samples were collected from 100 patients with suspected urinary bladder neoplasms and 20 normal control subjects. Both FISH examination and cytology study of urine exfoliative cells were conducted with each sample. The specificity and sensitivity of FISH and cytology were analyzed on the basis of bladder biopsy histology.The sensitivity of FISH examination of bladder malignant tumor was 93.5% (87/93), which was much higher than that of cytology (49.5%, 46/93). Biopsies confirmed 88 cases of urothelial carcinoma among the 100 suspected patients, with 46 high grade tumors and 42 low grade tumors; 30 cases of high stage (T(2-4)) and 58 cases of low stage (T(a-1)). The sensitivity of FISH examination of urothelial carcinoma was 94.3%, which was much higher than that of cytology (52.3%). FISH examination was significantly more sensitive than cytology for low grade and low stage urothelial carcinoma, as well as for rare non-urothelial malignancies (P < 0.05). The specificity of FISH and cytology of bladder malignancies was 92.6% (25/27) and 96.3% (26/27), for urothelial carcinoma was 81.3% (26/32) and 96.9% (31/32), respectively.FISH shows high sensitivity and relatively high specificity for the detection of urinary bladder neoplasms, especially for the diagnosis of low grade urothelial carcinoma and non-urothelial malignancies, which were difficult to be detected by cytology.",

        "abstract": "Pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) has been performed during radical prostatectomy in nearly all patients with clinically localized prostatic carcinoma (PCa), while the specific regions that needed to be removed demonstrated bifurcation among urologist. However, clinical studies comparing extended PLND (ePLND) with standard PLND (sPLND) and limited PLND (lPLND) reveal conflicting, or even opposing results.All controlled trials comparing ePLND with sPLND or lPLND were identified through comprehensive searches of the PubMed, Cochrane Library and Embase databases. A systematic review and meta-analysis of these studies were then performed.Eighteen studies with a total of 8,914 patients were included. Regardless of being compared with sPLND or lPLND, ePLND significantly improved LN retrieval [ePLND vs. sPLND: weighted mean difference (WMD) 11.93, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 9.91-13.95, p < 0.00001; ePLND vs. lPLND: WMD 8.27, 95 % CI 3.53-13.01, p = 0.0006] and the detection of more LNs positive of metastasis [risk ratio (RR) 3.51, 95 % CI 2.14-5.75, p < 0.00001; RR 3.50, 95 % CI 2.20-5.55, p < 0.00001, respectively]. EPLND decreased the complication rate, but the differences were not statistically significant (RR 1.52, 95 % CI 0.87-2.65, p = 0.14; RR 1.52, 95 % CI 0.67-3.45, p = 0.32, respectively). Operating time, estimated blood loss, length of hospital stay and biochemical recurrence (BCR) were statistically insignificant between techniques.ePLND shows benefits associated with increased LNs yield, LNs positivity, and safety, significantly with no risk of side effects. However, ePLND did not decrease BCR. Additional high-quality, well-designed randomized controlled trials and comparative studies with long-term follow-up results are required to define the optimal procedure for patients with clinically localized PCa.",

Methods From May 2007 to July 2008,12 patients with penile squamous cell carcinoma underwent bilateral ilio-inguinal lymphadenectomy.Double inguinal incisions parallel to inguinal ligament were used for each side,one incision was 3 cm superior and another was 4-5 cm inferior to the ligament.Skin flap between these two incisions was fashioned to form groin skin bridge.Pelvic lymph nodes were dissected through the superior incision,and then the superficial and deep groups of inguinal lymph nodes were removed en bloc under the groin skin bridge with saphenous vein preserved. Results In these 12 patients,there was no ischemia,necrosis of flap margin occurred,and also no wound infection found.Ten of them(83.33%) had their 4 incisional wounds healing in time without any problems.Another two experienced the delayed healing of one incision because of lymphatic leakage.Edema of lower extremity was observed in 3 patients(25.00%),and scrotal edema occurred in 4 patients(33.33%). Conclusions The technique of groin skin bridge could provide better preservation of anastomotic vessels in the superficial fatty layer of Camper's fascia,therefore protect the viability of skin flap in ilio-inguinal lymphadenectomy.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the risk factors associated with the in-hospital complications of radical cystectomy. Methods The records of 128 consecutive patients who underwent radical cystectomy from November 2006 to October 2009 were reviewed. Preoperative, intraoperative risk variables were defined based on POSSUM score and APACHE II score. ASA score and m-ACCI score were used to evaluate the co-mobidities. All variables were analyzed to evaluate the risk factors associated with in-hospital complications of radical cystectomy. Results: In the 128 patients undergoing radical cystectomy, 58 patients (45.31%) had complications, with 51 (39.84%) minor complicatons and 7 (5.47%) major complications. Wound dehiscence or unhealing (22.66%), infection (20.31%) and ileus (17.19%) were the most common complications. The risk factors related to the in-hospital complications of radical cystectomy are age \u226565 yr. (P<0.001,OR=1.067), volume of intraoperative blood transfusion \u2265600 mL(P = 0.023,OP=1.001), m-ACCI score (P<0.001, OR= 1.583), ASA score \u2265 III (P = 0.003,OR = 2.411), partial cystectomy history (P = 0.025 OR = 2.444), intraoperative heart rate>120 beats/min(P<0.001, 0R = 11.861). Conclusions: Wound complication, postoperative infection and ileus are the most common complications of radical cystectomy. Age, volume of intraoperative blood transfusion, m-ACCI score, ASA score, partial cystectomy history and intraoperative heart rate are significant risk factors.",

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified and extracted from MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL. The quality of the included RCTs was assessed using the Jadad score, and heterogeneity was analyzed using the chi-squared test. The data of the included RCTs were collected, extracted, and assessed by our protocol. A total of nine RCTs were identified from the search strategy. Compared with the placebo and tolterodine treatments, both short-term (mostly 12-week) trials indicated that solifenacin significantly reduced urgency episodes, micturitions, and incontinence episodes per 24 h. Compared with the solifenacin (5 mg) group, the solifenacin (10 mg) group was significantly better in terms of the number of micturitions per 24 h. With regard to adverse effects, the patients treated with solifenacin had significantly higher rates of constipation and blurred vision than patients treated with tolterodine. The solifenacin therapy was not inferior to tolterodine in terms of efficacy profiles and had a similar incidence of overall adverse events compared with tolterodine treatment. Solifenacin (5 mg) is thus a recommended dose because of its reported balance between efficacy and acceptable tolerability.",

In this study, we compare the long-term survival outcomes of radical prostatectomy (RP), radiation therapy (RT), brachytherapy (BT), androgen- deprivation therapy (ADT), and watchful waiting (WW) in high-risk prostate cancer (PCa). Overall, RP/(RT plus ADT) gave the best survival outcome in patients with high-risk PCa, whereas ADT/WW had the worst outcome. The overall priority for treatment strategy could be ranked as follows: RP/(RT plus ADT), RT, and ADT/WW. RP had significant better overall survival (OS) than RT or BT, and RP had significant lower cancer-specific mortality (CSM) than RT (0.51 [95% CI 0.30-0.73], P<0.001). ADT improved the cancer-specific survival (CSS) of RP based on a case-controlled study; added ADT to RT failed to challenge the position of RP but could improve the outcome of RT. In conclusions,RP/(RT plus adjuvant ADT) could both be used for the first-line therapy of high-risk PCa.

        "abstract": "To examine the effectiveness of barbed suture (BS) compared with conventional sutures for vesicourethral anastomosis (VUA) during minimally invasive radical prostatectomy (RP).Relevant studies comparing the safety and efficacy of BS with conventional sutures during minimally invasive RP were identified through a literature search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. The outcome measures included baseline characteristics, primary outcomes, and secondary outcomes.Ten studies (378 cases and 369 controls) were included. No significant differences between the 2 groups were detected in any of the baseline variables except for age (P = .02). The BS group had a shorter operation time (mean difference [MD], 10.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], -14.38 to -6.69; P <.01), a shorter VUA time (MD, -5.35; 95% CI, -7.44 to -3.25; P <.01), and a shorter posterior reconstruction time (MD, -0.56; 95% CI, -1.10 to -0.02; P = .04) than those in the conventional sutures group. No significant differences were detected between the 2 groups in other outcomes of interest. In subgroup and sensitivity analyses, there was no change in the significance of any of the outcomes.This meta-analysis indicates that VUA using BS as opposed to conventional suture is associated with a shorter operative time, comparable postoperative complication rate, and convenience for manipulation, which is of benefit to the surgeon learning robot-assisted RP and laparoscopic RP. Given that the inherent limitations, future well-designed randomized controlled trials are required to confirm our findings.",

        "abstract": "The standard management of upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UUT-UC) is nephroureterectomy with bladder cuff excision, but after surgery, approximately 22-47% of patients with UUT-UC develop subsequent bladder tumour recurrence, potentially because of the implantation of cancer cells from the primary tumour.To conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of prophylactic intravesical chemotherapy in the prevention of bladder recurrence after nephroureterectomy for UUT-UC.An electronic database search of Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, CancerLit and ClinicalTrials.gov was performed to identify appropriate studies prior to March 2013.All studies comparing nephroureterectomy alone with prophylactic intravesical chemotherapy after nephroureterectomy were included. The main outcome measure for this meta-analysis was the rate of bladder recurrence after nephroureterectomy. The search was not limited by language. The review process followed the guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration. The analysis was conducted using the Review Manager Version RevMan 5.0 software (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration).A total of 592 patients were included in this study, of whom 257 underwent intravesical instillation after nephroureterectomy and 335 underwent nephroureterectomy alone. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that the rate of recurrence after 12\u200amonths was significantly lower in the intravesical instillation after nephroureterectomy group than in the nephroureterectomy-alone group [odds ratio (OR): 0.48; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.28-0.81; P\u2009=\u20090.006]. A significant decrease in bladder recurrence after at least 24\u200amonths was also observed in the intravesical instillation after nephroureterectomy group (OR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.24-0.67; P\u2009=\u20090.0004). A subgroup analysis demonstrated that the pattern of differences was similar to those from the total group analysis.Prophylactic intravesical chemotherapy was effective for the prevention of bladder recurrence after nephroureterectomy. Therefore, we suggest that prophylactic intravesical chemotherapy should be performed in patients with UUT-UC after nephroureterectomy, but the optimal chemotherapy regimen and the initial time of instillation should be explored in future studies.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the effect of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) on Toll-like receptors (TLRs) expression and cytokine production in human bladder cancer cell line T24.Human transitional carcinoma cell line T24 was cultured in RPMI1640 medium with 10% FBS, BCG was added into the cell culture with various doses in bacteria-cell ratio. After T24 cells were stimulated by BCG for 1 hour, total RNA of cells was extracted. RT-PCR procedure was conducted with the primer of TLR-2 and TLR-4, and the products were analyzed with agarose gels electrophoresis. Then the expression of TLR-2 and TLR-4 in T24 cells was assessed by the analyzing system of gel imaging. After the stimulation culture for 12 hours, the supernatant of cells was collected. The levels of IL-4 and IL-12 in each sample were assayed by ELISA method.The expression level of either TLR-2 or TLR-4 was increased by the stimulation of BCG in a dose-dependent manner, the effects reached the maximal level at the dose of BCG as 10 bacilli per cell. The production of IL-12 in T24 cells was also increased gradually by the stimulation of BCG in a dose-dependent manner, and the dose of BCG obtained maximal effect was 10 bacilli per cell, which is coincident with the results observed in the expression of TLRs. There was no difference showed on the production of IL-4 between T24 cells stimulated with BCG and control.The stimulation of BCG not only up-regulated the expression of TLR-2 and TLR-4, but also increased the production of IL-12 in bladder cancer T24 cell line. The expression of TLRs and the production of cytokine in bladder cancer cells may be related to the BCG-induced immunol response to human bladder cancer.",

We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of primary tumor location on prognosis in patients with UTUC who had undergone radical nephroureterectomy(RNU). We included eligible studies that reported hazard ratios(HRs) estimates with 95% confidence intervals(CIs) for the association between tumor location and recurrence-free survival(RFS) and cancer-specific survival(CSS) of UTUC. The local advanced tumors(pT3/4) and nodal positive(pN+) tumors in patients stratified by tumor location were also estimated. The review contained 17 studies including a total of 12094 patients were identified. Although it was not significant in univariable analysis, meta-analysis demonstrated that ureteral tumors had a worse prognosis than renal pelvic tumors on RFS and CSS in multivariable analysis after adjusted for all covariates. Multifocal tumors also showed a significantly association with both disease progression and cancer-specific mortality in univariable and multivariable analyses. However, no statistically significant differences were found between renal pelvic and ureteral tumors in presentation of pT3/4 and pN+ tumors. Our meta-analysis indicated that ureteral and multifocal tumors are independent prognosticators of disease progression and cancer-specific survival in patients with UTUC treated with RNU.",

Nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (NS-RP) has been widely accepted as the best choice treatment for localised PCa. However, erectile dysfunction (ED) and urinary incontinence are commonly observed after NS-RP. Using meta-analysis, we examined if phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5-Is) could improve the symptoms of ED in patients undergoing NS-RP. This review contained seven randomised placebo-controlled trials with a total of 2,655 male patients. Patients in PDE5-Is group showed significant improvement in the International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function domain score (IIEF-EF), Global Assessment Questionnaire (GAQ), Sexual Encounter Profile question 2 (SEP-2) and SEP-3. Although the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were high in both groups (56.44% vs. 40.63%), the safety profile were acceptable, with low incidence of discontinuation rate due to adverse events. Therefore, PDE5-Is are recommended for the treatment of post-NS-RP ED. Patients should be informed of possible adverse events.",

We performed a systematic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases to identify studies that compared HIV acquisition for the circumcised and uncircumcised groups. The reference lists of the included and excluded studies were also screened. Fifteen studies (4 RCTs and 11 prospective cohort studies) were included, and the related data were extracted and analyzed in a meta-analysis. Our study revealed strong evidence that male circumcision was associated with reduced HIV acquisition for HIV(-) males during sexual intercourse with females [pooled adjusted risk ratio (RR): 0.30, 95% CI 0.24 0.38, P &amp;lt; 0.00001] and provided a 70% protective effect. In contrast, no difference was detected in HIV acquisition for HIV (-) females between the circumcised and uncircumcised groups (pooled adjusted RR after sensitivity analysis: 0.68, 95%CI 0.40-1.15, P = 0.15). In conclusion, male circumcision could significantly protect males but not females from HIV acquisition at the population level. Male circumcision may serve as an additional approach toward HIV control, in conjunction with other strategies such as HIV counseling and testing, condom promotion, and so on.",

Methods: Ninety patients diagnosed pathologically as adrenal phaeochromocytoma from January 1998 to December 2004 in the Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical College were included in the study. Patients with phaeochromocytoma were classified into the typical group and atypical group based on their clinical manifestations. The differences were analyzed between the two groups in terms of patient age, tumor location and maximal diameter, incidence of hypertension, and plasma catecholamine level. Results: About 24.4% (22/90) of the patients with phaeochromocytoma were classified as atypical. There was no significant difference in the maximal tumor diameter between the two groups. The plasma norepinephrine level of the atypical group was significantly lower than that of the typical group (P=0.001), and the positive rate of plasma norepinephrine of the atypical group was also lower than that of the typical group (P=0.003). Conclusion: Compared with typical phaeochromocytoma, atypical phaeochromocytoma is associated with a lower plasma norepinephrine level. The size of adrenal tumor cannot contribute to the diagnosis of atypical phaeochromocytoma. Based on atypical manifestations, CT examination results, and plasma catecholamine level, most atypical phaeochromocytoma should be diagnosed correctly. \u00a9 2008 Editorial Board of Chin J Evid-based Med.",

        "abstract": "To observe whether umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) can differentiate into the smooth muscle cells (SMCs) induced by bladder SMCs (BSMCs) conditioned medium so as to seek an alternative seed cells for the repair and reconstruction of the urology system.UCMSCs and BSMCs were harvested from umbilical cord of full-term births and bladder tissues which were obtained from patients who underwent a radical cystectomy. BSMCs conditioned medium was prepared by mixing supernatant of BSMCs at passages 1-5 with complete medium at ratio of 1:1. UCMSCs at passage 3 were cultured with BSMCs conditioned medium (induced group, group A) and complete medium (control group, group B), respectively; simple BSMCs served as positive control group (group C). The morphological changes of co-cultured UCMSCs were observed by inverted phase microscope, the expressions of a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA), Calponin, and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC) of UCMSCs were tested by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot at 7 and 14 days.The morphology of UCMSCs in group A started to change from a polygonal and short spindle shape to a large and spindle shape after co-culture, which was similar to BSMCs morphology; but the morphology of UCMSCs did not change obviously in group B. Immunofluorescence staining showed that the expressions of alpha-SMA, Calponin, and SM-MHC were positive in group C. At 7 days, the expression of a-SMA could be observed in groups A and B; at 14 days, the positive expression of alpha-SMA increased gradually in group A, but it did not increase in group B. At 7 days, a positive expression of Calponin could be observed in group A, and positive expression increased obviously at 14 days; the expression of Calponin could not be observed at 7 and 14 days in group B. However, the expression of SM-MHC could not be observed in groups A and B. The results of Western blot showed the expressions of alpha-SMA, Calponin, and SM-MHC protein were consistent with the results of immunofluorescence staining.UCMSCs have the potential of differentiation into SMCs and may be a potential seed cells for bladder tissue engineering.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To evaluate the causes, prevention and treatment of complications in urological laparos copy. Methods:From Sep 2003 to Sep 2007, 883 cases of urologic laparoscopies were performed: 74 cases of trans peritoneal laparoscopy while 809 cases of retroperitoneal laparoscopy. Data including each patient's diagnosis, type of surgery (transperitoneal or retroperitoneal laparoscopy), operation time, complications and in-patient day after operation were retrospectively reviewed and clinically analyzed. Results: Complications appeared on 85 of 883 (9. 6 % ) cases while no patient died. Complications appeared on 8 of 74 cases (10.8 % ) of transperitoneal laparoscopy while 77 of 809 (9.5 %) cases of retroperitoneal laparoscopy. The difference between groups was not statistical significant(P>0.05). The average operation time was 121\u00b146 minutes for transperitoneal laparoscopy and 82 \u00b17 minutes for retroperitoneal laparoscopy. The difference between groups was statistical significant(P<0.01). The average in-patient day after operation was 6.5 \u00b1 3.1 days for transperitoneal laparoscopy and 5.8 \u00b1 2.2 days for retroperitoneal laparoscopy. There was statistic difference between transperitoneal laparoscopy and retroperito neal laparoscopy on the rate of complications(P<0.05). Divided by 2003,2004,2005,2006,2007, surgical complication rates were 31.2%(10/32), 11%(16/145), 7.9%(20/252), 8.3%(22/265), 9 . 5%(17/189), the difference was statistically significant (P<0.01). Conclusions: :There was no statistic difference between transperitoneal laparoscopy and retroperitoneal laparoscopy on the occurrence of complications. Transperitoneal laparoscopy took more time on operation than retroperitoneal laparoscopy. The average time in hospital after surgery of transperitoneal laparoscopy was longer than retroperitoneal laparoscopy. The rate of complications of laparoscopic surgery de- creased with the passage of time.",

        "abstract": "To assess the effectiveness of dapoxetine in the treatment of premature ejaculation.Both English and Chinese studies involving men with prematrue ejaculation who were treated with dapoxetine from the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CNKI, CBM, VIP between 1979 and 2009.were included in the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the data processed by RevMan.Five RCTs involving 4433 patients were included in the Meta analysis, of which 3 were of grade A and 2 were of grade B according to the quality evaluation of methodology. Intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT), patient-reported global impression of change (PGI), satisfaction with sexual intercourse (SWSI), perceived control over ejaculation (PCOE), personal distress related to ejaculation (PDRE) were used for assessment. Meta analysis based on included studies of patients having been treated with dapoxetine for 9-24 weeks showed that: (1) the difference of the patients' IELT between treatment group and control group was statistically significant [P<0.001, WMD (95%CI) was 1.38 (1.21,1.55)]; (2) the difference of the PGI of development in premature ejaculation between treatment group and control group was statistically significant [P<0.001, OR (95%CI) was 3.56 (2.60,4.88)]; (3) the difference of the patients' SWSI between treatment group and control group was statistically significant [P<0.001, OR (95%CI) was 3.85 (2.08,7.10)]; the difference of the patients' score of SWSI between treatment group and control group was statistically significant [P<0.001, WMD (95%CI) was 0.55 (0.48,0.62)]; (4) the difference of the patients' change of PCOE between treatment group and control group was statistically significant [P<0.001, OR (95%CI) was 2.87(2.30,3.58)]; the difference of the patients' score of PCOE between treatment group and control group was statistically significant [P<0.001, WMD (95%CI) was 0.63(0.49,0.78)]; (5) after being treated with dapoxetine for 9-24 weeks, the difference of the patients' change of PDRE between treatment group and control group was statistically significant [P<0.001, OR (95%CI) was 2.02 (1.69,2.42)]. All the RCTs reported the side effects of dapoxetine, but the results showed that there were no serious side effects of dapoxetine during the treatment period.The available evidence indicates that dapoxetine would improve the symptoms of premature ejaculation, prolong IELT over 9-24 weeks in men from a wide range of cultural backgrounds, and significantly improve all patients' reported outcomes and the patients' clinical global impressions of premature ejaculation, including more control, greater satisfaction, and less distress.",

We undertook a meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of conventional laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with a transperitoneal (TLRP) approach, versus that of an extraperitoneal (ELRP) approach, for treatment of localized PCa. A comprehensive literature search retrieved 14 publications, with a total of 1715 patients. Meta-analysis of these studies showed that an ELRP approach was associated with a significantly shorter postoperative catheterization time (MD: 1.99; 95% CI: 0.52 to 3.54; P\u2009=\u20090.008), less blood transfusion rate (OR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.03 to 4.06; P\u2009=\u20090.04), shorter intestinal function recovery time (MD: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.52 to 1.09; P\u2009<\u20090.0001) and shorter hospitalization days (MD: 2.71; 95% CI: 1.03 to 4.39; P\u2009=\u20090.002). In addition, our results showed no statistically significant differences between the two groups in operation time (MD: 19.39; 95% CI: -6.67 to 45.44; P\u2009=\u20090.014), intraoperative blood loss (MD: 4.89; 95% CI: -105.00 to 114.79; P\u2009=\u20090.93) and total complication rate (RR: 1.22; 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.74; P\u2009=\u20090.27).

        "abstract": "Objective To summarize the experience and improve the clinical technique of retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy.Methods From May 2003 to May 2010,retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy procedures were performed on 447 patients with adrenal lesions(175 male and 272 female,aged 15~84 years old),including 128 cases of primary aldosteronism,112 Cushing's syndrome,57 pheochromocytoma,10 paraganglioma,28 myelolipoma,17 adrenal gland cyst,11 myoschwannoma,9 adrenal medullary hyperplasia,5 primary adrenal nodulus hyperplasia,3 primarily adrenal carcinoma,3 metastatic adenocarcinoma,and 64 nonfunctional adenoma.The average diameter of the adenoma was(2.8\u00b12.1) cm(ranging 0.5~10 cm).All patients adopted retroperitoneal approach and all the operations applied the U-shaped anatomic step to cut off the adrenal lesions.The operation time,estimated average bleeding loss(EBL),postoperative hospitalization and complications were recorded for analysis.Results 12 cases switched to open surgery owing to bleeding,pneumothorax or greater body mass index,thus the success rate of operation was 97.3%(435/447).The mean operative time,EBL and postoperative hospitalization was(45\u00b122) min(ranging 15~140 min),(35\u00b115) mL(ranging 15~200 mL),and(5.3\u00b12.5) d(ranging 3~10 d) respectively.14 patients needed 1~2 u of blood transfusion.The occurrence of minor postoperative complications was 5.6%(25/447).Conclusions Retroperitoneal laparoscopic surgery has less interference on abdominal organs.The U-shaped anatomic step allows direct and clear vision of the anatomical structures,resulting in shorter operation time and lower rate of perioperational complications.Retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy is the gold standard for treating benign adrenal diseases.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the effect of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) on locally advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) after radical nephrectomy in terms of tumor progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).176 cases with locally advanced ccRCC were followed up in West China Hospital from 1999 to 2007. All patients were divided into two groups according to whether treated with IFN-alpha as adjuvant therapy. PFS and OS were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model.Median follow-up was 48 months, 53 cases of disease progressed, and 37 were dead. Mortality rate within treatment and observed groups were 44.3% and 18.6%, respectively (P < 0.001). There were significant differences between the two groups in PFS [(59.12 +/- 5.04) months vs. (81.42 +/- 5.84) months, P = 0.005] and OS [(74.66 +/- 4.77) months vs. (85.18 +/- 4.92) months, P = 0.031]. Cox regression model demonstrated that IFN-alpha, as adjuvant therapy after surgery, was an independent negative risk factor for the prognosis of locally advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma.IFN-alpha was ineffective in locally advanced ccRCC after radical nephrectomy in terms of PFS and OS, and there is no evidence that IFN-alpha could be considered as adjuvant therapeutic drug.",

        "abstract": "Despite the various treatment and prevention options for catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD), many uncertainties persist in clinical practice. To systematically review the literature on the management of CRBD in patients who underwent surgery.Eligible, randomized controlled trials were identified from electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, and EMBASE) without language restrictions. Selection criteria, methodological rigor, and risk of bias were evaluated by two independent reviewers using Cochrane Collaboration's tools.A total of 1441 patients from 14 articles published between 2005 and 2014 were included. Data heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis; therefore, data were synthesized narratively. Compared with nonurological surgery, CRBD is frequent and occurred immediately after urological surgery, especially after transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT). Data from included studies suggested that muscarinic antagonists, anesthetics, antiepileptics, and analgesics were associated with significant improvement in symptoms and reducing the incidence of CRBD, compared with placebo. Anticholinergic agents and antiepileptics (gabapentin and pregabalin) administered 1 hour before surgery reduced the incidence and severity of CRBD in the immediate postoperative period. Tramadol and ketamine are centrally acting opioid analgesics with antimuscarinic actions, which effectively prevent CRBD when administered intravenously. Paracetamol administered was also effective for the management of CRBD. Additionally, we perceived that TURBT is the surgical procedure that is the most refractory to treatment.Muscarinic antagonists, anesthetics, antiepileptics, and paracetamol appear to achieve the greatest improvement in the clinical symptoms and a significant reduction in the incidence of CRBD compared with placebo. Although these studies observed a high incidence of intervention-related side effects, in general, patients tolerated these treatments well.",

For each patient, IPSS and NIH-CPSI were evaluated, serum PSA levels, prostatic volume and urine WBC were measured. EPS was collected before operation for the test of C3a level, while EPS also was obtained from 10 healthy men as normal control. Prostatic tissue was collected by the operation and histological inflammation was investigated by histopathological study.C3a levels in EPS of the BPH patients: severe inflammation group > mild inflammation group > normal control group (all P < 0.01). C3a levels in the EPS could be used to determine whether BPH combined inflammation, sensitivity : 0.97, specificity: 0.70. C3a levels in EPS was not relevant with PSA, fPSA levels, age, BMI, prostate volume or urine WBC levels; but NIH-CPSI was correlated (r = 0.495, P < 0.01). C3a in EPS of retained catheter group was more than non-catheter group significantly (P < 0.05).C3a is an ideal criteria to diagnose prostatic histological inflammation in BPH patients. There is no convincing evidence to correlate C3a in EPS with serum PSA levels, BMI, age, prostatic volume and urine's WBC. Excessively high C3a levels and the NIH-CPSI, indwelling have correlations.",

Methods The clinical data of two patients of VHL disease with renal tumor were retrospectively analyzed and review of literatures. Results Two patients were female. The first patient with 36 years old who was admitted because of lumbar pain for three months,and had operation for retinal hemangioblastoma of left eye eight years before. CT indicated bilateral renal tumor and renal cysts. VHL syndrome with bilateral renal carcinoma was diagnosed and the patient refused operation.and the patient is stable with little changes througth follow-up. The second patient with 41 years old who was admitted because of right renal tumor diagnosed by ultrasonic B for four years and intermittent haematuria for two years. The patient had operation for cerebellar hemangioblastoma four years before. CT indicated right huge renal tumor with mutiple renal cysts.,and multiple left renal tumor and cysts. VHL syndrome with right renal carcinoma was diagnosed and radical nephrectomy was followed ,and the pathology was renal clear carcinoma.and the patient is stable with little changes througth follow-up. Conclusion VHL syndrome should be considered when renal tumor with bilateral,multicentric or with multiple cysts. Treatment should be individualized with watchful waiting with nephron-sparing surgery. Nephrectomy should be avoided when possible.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the efficacy and safety of monopolar (M-TURP) and bipolar (B-TURP) transurethral resection of the prostate in benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) patients.Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from electronic databases without language restrictions. Database search, quality assessment, and data extraction were independently performed. The primary postoperative outcomes of topical M-TURP and B-TURP were maximum flow rate (Qmax) and/or International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Safety was estimated by TUR syndrome; need for transfusion; clot retention; bladder neck contracture (BNC); urethral stricture (US); and catheter removal time. Efficacy and safety were investigated using the Review Manager.Thirty-one trials met the inclusion criteria. Pooled analysis revealed significant difference in efficacy between the M-TURP and B-TURP groups. Safety analysis revealed significant improvement in the TUR syndrome with B-TURP than with M-TURP. Pooled analysis revealed that clot retention was significantly higher in M-TURP than in B-TURP. Moreover, pooled analysis revealed no significant difference between both groups in the blood transfusion frequency or late complications (urethral strictures) and bladder neck constriction.This systematic review indicates that B-TURP was significantly better in the result of Qmax and for decreasing the incidence of TUR syndrome and clot retention. No significant differences were observed in the nature of adverse events such as transfusions, retention after catheter removal, and urethral complications between both groups. Thus, B-TURP is the next generation \"gold standard\" for benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) because it is associated with a lower rate of clinically relevant complications such as TUR syndrome and clot retention.",

        "abstract": "We evaluated differences in cytokine responses and T-lymphocyte subsets following retroperitoneal laparoscopic and conventional open radical nephrectomies for localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC).A total of 62 patients with T(1)N(0)M(0) staged RCC were randomized to either retro-laparoscopic (n = 31) or open (n = 31) radical nephrectomy. Plasma levels of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) were measured separately by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) preoperatively and on postoperative days 1 and 5. Levels of CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+) as well as the CD4(+):CD8(+) ratio were acquired by flow cytometry at the same time points.Levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 increased significantly compared to preoperative values in both groups (p < 0.05) on postoperative day 1, and all the parameters in the open group were significantly higher than those in the retro-laparoscopy group (p < 0.05). On postoperative day 1, the levels of CD3(+) and CD4(+) and the CD4(+):CD8(+) ratio decreased markedly compared to preoperative values for both groups (p < 0.05). Elevations of the CD4(+):CD8(+) ratio in the retro-laparoscopy group (p < 0.05) and the CD8(+) level in the open group (p < 0.05) were observed when compared with the other group. On postoperative day 5, the levels of CD3(+) and CD4(+) and the CD4(+):CD8(+) ratio in the retro-laparoscopy group, as well as the level of CD8(+) in the open group, returned to about preoperative levels (p < 0.05). Follow-up ranged from 4 to 14 months postoperatively in all 62 patients with a 100% cancer-specific survival rate in both groups.Retroperitoneal laparoscopic radical nephrectomy is associated with the milder cytokine responses caused by trauma and inflammation and the better preserved distribution of T-lymphocytes.",

From 1999 to 2013, 12 cases of AMH have been pathologically diagnosed after operation in our hospital. The clinical characteristics, process of diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis during follow-up of all patients are summarized retrospectively. Results. Four cases were trended to be AMH and 6 cases were trended to be pheochromocytoma before operation; moreover, the other two patients were diagnosed accidentally. All patients, except for the patient with mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma of left kidney by open surgery, experienced a smooth laparoscopic adrenalectomy, including 2 with radical nephrectomy, 10 of which experienced unilateral adrenalectomy, 1 was bilaterally partial adrenalectomy, and the remaining one was unilaterally complete removal and then 2/3 partially contralateral excision. After a medium follow-up of 6.5 years, it demonstrated a satisfactory outcome of 8 cured patients and 4 symptomatic improved patients. Conclusions. AMH presents a mimicking morphology and clinical manifestation with pheochromocytoma. Surgery could be the only effective choice for the treatment of AMH and showed a preferable prognosis after a quite long follow-up.",

        "abstract": "Objective To assess the clinical efficacy and treatment-induced side effects of intravesically administered bacillus calmette-guerin (BCG) plus chemotherapy following TURB-t in patients with superficial bladder cancer compared with BCG alone. Methods Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from PubMed (1950 to December 2006), Ovid (1966 to December 2006), EMbase (1984 to December 2006), The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2006), CBM (1978 to 2006) and VIP (1989 to 2006). We also handsearched relevant published and unpublished reports as well as their references. The quality of included trials was evaluated by two reviewers. We used The Cochrane Collaboration\u2019s RevMan 4.2.9 software for statistical analysis. Results Four studies involving 681 patients were included. Meta-analyses showed that ,in patients with Ta and T1 bladder cancer ,there was a significant difference in the recurrence rate between intravesically administered BCG plus chemotherapy and BCG alone (RR 0.69, 95%CI 0.53to 0.90). In patients with Tis bladder cancer, no significant difference was found in the recurrence rate between the two groups (RR 1.22, 95%CI 0.97 to 1.54). In patients with Ta, T1 and Tis bladder cancer ,no statistically significant difference was found in the incidence of side effects (RR 0.85, 95%CI 0.70 to 1.03). Conclusion Compared with BCG alone, intravesically administered BCG plus chemotherapy in patients with Ta and T1 superficial bladder cancer can reduce the incidence of tumor recurrence more effectively. For patients with Tis bladder cancer , the two therapeutic regimens do not differ in the incidence of tumor recurrence. The two regimens have similar side effects. There is a moderate possibility of selection bias ,performance bias and publication bias in the small number of included studies ,which weakens the strength of the evidence of our results. Better evidence from more high-quality double-blind randomized controlled trials is needed.",

In vitro cultured rabbit bladder smooth muscle cells were seeded on UAMG and the cell proliferation was observed. The cytotoxicity of the aqueous extract of the UAMG against the cells was evaluated by MTT assay, and its biocompatibility was assessed by implanting the grafts subcutaneously on the back of the rabbits. In 24 male rabbits, a 2-cm urethral defect was induced and repaired with UAMG (experimental group, n=12) or left untreated (control group, n=12). In both groups, the rabbits were sacrificed 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the operation for histological and immunohistochemical examination of the tissue regeneration.The UAMG had a reticular fibrous structure without cell residues. The bladder smooth muscle cells showed normal proliferation on UAMG with normal cell morphology. The rabbits receiving the implants showed no abnormal response, and the UAMGs gradually degraded in vivo with grade 0 or 1 cytotoxcity showing satisfactory cytocompatibility. In the experimental group, new urethral tissues that were histologically compatible with normal urethral tissues were regenerated in the defect area 12 weeks after UAMG implantation.As a tissue engineered scaffold material for urethral reconstruction, the UAMG possesses good biocompatibility and can induce the regeneration of urethral epithelial cells and smooth muscle cells.",

A meta-analysis was carried out to distinguish overall differences between the two groups.Our literature search yielded two randomized controlled trials and two cohort studies, involving a total of 346 patients, which met our inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference between the comprehensive bowel preparation and limited bowel preparation in wound infection [relative risk (RR) 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.05(0.46-2.40); P = 0.86], mortality [RR 95 % CI, 1.06 (0.32-3.55); P = 0.76], ileus [RR 95 % CI, 0.86 (0.37, 2.00); P = 0.40], sepsis [RR 95 % CI, 0.71 (0.20, 2.52); P = 0.78], anastomotic leakage [RR 95 % CI, 0.81 (0.15, 4.21); P = 0.83], wound dehiscence [RR 95 % CI, 0.92 (0.40, 2.13); P = 0.67], peritonitis [RR 95 % CI, 0.64 (0.08, 5.10); P = 0.63] or fistula [RR 95 % CI, 0.71 (0.18,2.75); P = 0.63].The limited evidence available demonstrated that the use of comprehensive bowel preparation for urinary diversion surgery using ileum does not offer any significant advantage over limited bowel preparation.

        "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. Extragastrointestinal stromal tumors (eGISTs) of the mesoileum are extremely rare and are usually treated with surgery combined with imatinib therapy.We present the case of a 43-year-old man who developed a large eGIST in the mesoileum. Abdominal/pelvic computed tomography revealed a large heterogeneous mass with cystic and solid components that measured 20.0 \u00d7 12.0 \u00d7 8.0 cm. Three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin, cyclophosphamide and hydroxycamptothecin; en bloc resection; and three more cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with the same regimen and drugs resulted in five years of disease-free survival without any symptoms.Although imatinib treatment is usually chosen for eGISTs, resistance to imatinib remains a concern; these patients may receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. In case of the former, further treatment, that is, surgery or adjuvant chemotherapy, depends on tumor response to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, this treatment for eGIST is not only beneficial but also economical for patients compared with imatinib. A novel treatment approach that combined neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy resulted in long-term survival in our patient, thus showing promise as a potential therapy for eGISTs.",

Methods We searched MEDLINE (1966 to 2005), EMBase (1984 to 2004), CBM (1980 to 2005), The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2005) and relevant journals to identify clinical trials involving finasteride in patients undergoing TURP. We also checked the references in the reports of each included trial. The quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was assessed according to the methods recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration, and the quality of non-RCTs was assessed based on the methods recommended by Jiang-ping Liu, Stroup and Hailey. Two reviewers extracted data independently and data analyses were conducted with The Cochrane Collaboration\u2019s RevMan 4.2. Result We included 4 RCTs and 1 non-RCT. The quality of 3 RCTs was graded C and the other one was graded B. The quality of the non-RCT was relatively high. Meta-analyses showed that with comparable age, international prostate symptom score, prostate specific antigen, preoperative volume of prostate and excision volume between the two groups (P>0.05), the perioperative bleeding volume (WMD \u201385.44, 95%CI \u2013117.31 to \u201353.58), the bleeding volume per gram of resected prostate tissue (WMD \u20133.5, 95%CI \u20136.34 to \u20130.58) and hemoglobin reduction (WMD \u20131.61, 95%CI \u20131.96 to \u20131.26) of the finasteride group were significantly smaller than those of the control group.

Methods cDNA fragment encoding mouse StAR was amplified by RT-PCR from the total RNA prepared from the testis, and then the RT-PCR product was cloned into pCR2. 1-TOPO vector. After StAR gene cDNA was sequenced, the Dig-labeled cRNA probes for mouse StAR gene were prepared by in vitro transcription from cDNA fragment. With the specific cRNA probes, in situ hybridization analysis was conducted in stressed mice testis and controls. Results The results demonstrated that StAR mRNA levels were significantly lower in stressed leydig cells than that in controls (P<0. 05). Conclusions The decreased StAR mRNA levels induced by stress may result in a reduced production of StAR protein, which compromised the transportation of cholesterol, the substrate for androgen biosynthesis, into mitochondria, resulting in a poor T production in leydig cells and finally a declined T levels.",

        "abstract": "Objective To assess the efficacy and safety of the tubeless approach with a ureteral stent versus nephrostomy tube for postoperative drainage following percutaneous nephrolithotomy,and to provide guidance for clinical practice.Methods Randomized controlled trials(RCTs)were identified from PubMed(1966 to August 2008),Ovid(1966 to August 2008),Embase(1966 to August 2008),The Cochrane Library(Issue 3,2008)and CBM(1978 to 2008).We also handsearched for relevant published and unpublished reports and check their references.The quality of the included trials was evaluated by two reviewers.We used The Cochrane Collaboration's RevMan 5.0.16 software for meta-analysis.Results Eight studies involving 507 patients were included.We divided the patients into three groups:small(8~9 Fr),medium(16~18 Fr)and large(20~24 Fr)according to the diameter of nephrostomy tube for the analysis.Our meta-analyses showed:\u2460Hospital stay(hours):There was no statistically significant difference between tubeless and small bore tubes,but a difference was found in the comparison of tubeless versus medium and large bore tubes [WMD(95%CI)\u201332.4(\u201333.64,\u201331.16)and \u201339.07(\u201367.75,\u201310.39),respectively];\u2460 Puncture site urinary leakage:No statistically significant difference was found between tubeless and small bore tubes,of between tubeless versus medium tubes [RR= 0.07,95%CI(0.00,1.15),P=0.06];\u2460Visual analogue scale scores for postoperative pain on Day 1:There was no statistically significant difference between tubeless and small bore tubes,but there was a difference in tubeless versus medium and large bore tubes [MD(95%CI)\u20132.80(\u20132.94,\u20132.66)and \u20132.04(\u20132.29,\u20131.79),respectively];\u2460No statistically significant difference was found in transfusion,fever or infection and operating time between tubeless and any size of nephrostomy tube.Conclusion No statistically significant difference between tubeless versus small bore tubes is found for any of the outcome measurements we analysed.Compared with medium and large bore tubes,tubeless PCNL of ureteral stent could reduce hospital stay,urine leakage and postoperative pain without an increase in complications.There is a moderate possibility of selection bias,performance bias and publication bias in this review,because of the small number of the included studies,which weakens the strength of the evidence of our results.Better evidence from more high-quality randomized controlled trials is needed.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To assess the efficacy of medical expulsive therapy for ureteral calculi with tamsulosin. Methods: We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA) Database, The Cochrane Library and Chinese Journal Full-text Database from 1995 to September 2006, as well as the proceedings of urological scientificconferences from 2000 to 2006. Randomized controlled trials(RCTs) comparing tamsulosin and other therapies for ureteral calculi among adults were included. Data were extracted by two reviewers independently and synthesized by STATA 9.0 software. Results: A total of 16 studies involving 1521 patients with distal or juxtavesical ureteral calculi were included. Compared with conservative therapy, tamsulosin showed higher expulsion rate [RR 1.50, 95%CI (1.20 to 1.87), P<0.000 1], shorter expulsion time [SMD -1.29, 95%CI (-2.27, -0.31)] and fewer patients requiring ESWL or ureteroscopy [RR 0.40, 95%CI (0.27, 0.59), P<0.05]. Compared with conservative therapy, the combination of tamsulosin plus deflazacort also showed higher expulsion rate [RR 1.59, 95%CI (1.31, 1.93)], shorter expulsion time [SMD -0.8, 95%CI (-1.18, -0.42)] and fewer patients requiring ESWL or ureteroscopy [RR 0.13, 95%CI (0.06, 0.31), P<0.05]. Compared with deflazacort alone, the combination of tamsulosin plus deflazacort demonstrated similar expulsion rate [RR 1.31, 95%CI (0.78, 2.23), P=0.31], but significantly reduced the dosage of analgesics [SMD 15.20, 95%CI (14.98, 15.52)] and decreased the proportion of patients requiring ESWL or ureteroscopy [RR 0.09,, 95%CI (0.02, 0.47), P<0.05]. Compared with deflazacort plus nifedipine, the combination of tamsulosin plus deflazacort showed higher expulsion rate [RR 1.20, 95%CI (1.07, 1.35), P=0.002], but similar expulsion time [SMD -1.34, 95%CI (-3.47, 0.79)] and proportion of patients requiring ESWL or ureteroscopy [RR 0.34, 95%CI (0.05, 2.22), P>0.05]. As for side effects, tamsulosin-based treatment and conservative therapy were comparable (P>0.05). Conclusions: Tamsulosin has a beneficial effect on the expulsion of ureteral calculi, especially for distal and juxtavesical ureteral calculi. Tamsulosin-based medical expulsive therapy at the dosage of 0.4mg daily is effective and safe for patients with distal ureteral calculi. More large-scale studies are required to define the efficacy of combination therapy of tamsulosin plus deflazacort.",

The animals were killed 1 and 2 months after operation and were studied in comparison with the SD rats of the sham operation group. H. E. staining was employed in observing spermatogenesis, and transmission electron microscopy and terminal deoxynuleotidyl tansferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) were used to detect apoptosis.No pathological changes were observed 1 month after operation. Two months after SSN denervation, spermatogenesis arrest was seen in the seminiferous tubules in which only Sertoli cells or Sertoli cells and a few spermatogonia remained. Chromosome condensation and breakage in germ cells were observed under transmission electron microscope in denervated testes. TUNEL showed that SSN denervation induced apoptosis of spermatogonia and Leydig cells significantly.The superior spermatic nerve seems to be involved in the regulation of spermatogenesis. Further study is worth doing to clarify the possible mechanism of action.",

Methods: We used the retroviral gene transfection and electro-perforation method to introduce extrogenous p53 and Rb gene separately or simultaneously into bladder cancer cell line T24. After confirmation of the expression of the extrogenous genes, we analyzed the growth curve, the cell cycle fraction, and the soft agar colony formation of the cancer cells. Results: p53 was inactivated but Rb was normal in the T24 cell before transfection. After single transfection or co-transfection of p53 and Rb, the expression of extrogenous p53 and Rb was confirmed at the mRNA and protein levels. Compared to control cells without any transfection, the T24 cells transfected with wild type p53 showed obvious decrease in cell growth, suppression of cell proliferation, and loss of capacity of soft agar colony formation. On the contrary, the cells with single transfection of Rb only showed decrease of soft agar colony formation. Conclusion: The introduction of extrogenous wild type p53 could suppress the growth, proliferation, and tumorigenicity of T24 cell, but the increased expression of Rb could purely reduce the tumorigenicity of T24 cell.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the risk factors for prostatic inflammation extent and infection in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) so as to manage prostatic inflammation more efficiently.Sixty patients with BPH undergoing TURP between September 2005 and December 2005 in West China Hospital of Sichuan University were studied. Prostate fluid (PF) was collected for the measurement of secretory IgA (SIgA) and complement 3 (C3). Prostate tissue were collected for testing bacterial 16S rDNA by real-time PCR, examining SIgA in the tissue and examining the inflammation. The possible clinical and immune risk factors for prostatic inflammation or infection were analyzed by using the logistic regression method.Abnormal white blood cell count in urinalysis, prostatic infection and a high concentration of C3 in PF are the risk factors for prostatic inflammation extent (P = 0.025, 0.034 and 0.035, respectively and odds ratio [OR] = 18.269, 8.284 and 1.508, respectively). Risk factors for prostatic infection include the C3 concentration and the concentration of SIgA in PF (P = 0.003 and 0.013, respectively, and OR=1.645 and 0.993, respectively).The present study suggests that prostatic inflammation is associated with urinary tract infection, prostatic infection and the activated complement and that prostatic infection is associated with the activated complement and downregulated mucosal immunity in prostates of the patients with BPH. It is also suggested that individual immune regulation should be considered in the treatment of prostatic inflammation and infection of patients with BPH.",

Of the participants, 30 were given transperitoneally laparoscopic adenectomy and 30 were given TLPJ approach. We compared the basic characteristics of the patients, as well as their conditions during and after operations.The two groups of patients had similar characteristics. No significant differences were found between the two approaches in terms of conversion to open surgery, estimated blood loss, transfusion, operating time, side injury, fluctuations of heart rate and blood pressure, and vascular accidents (P>0.05), although slight, but not significant, advantages were shown in the TLPJ patients on starting food intake and physical activities. Similar results were also found .in drainage volume, time to remove drainage, length of hospital stay, usage of analgesic, fever incidence, infection and intestinal obstruction etc (P>0.05). Above all, no significant differences were found between the two groups in recurrence, metastasis and overall survival rates (P>0.05).Laparoscopic surgery with TLPJ approach, translumbar combined with entirely side peritoneum opened, is safe and efficient compared with the traditional transperitoneal approach for patients with large adrenal neoplasms.",

MTT method was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of BECM, which was implanted into the rabbit back for evaluating its histocompatibility meant that the toxicity, degradation and local inflammatory response were studied through gross observation and HE staining.The prepared rabbit BECMs were freeze-drying, and looked like thin semitransparent membrane. By electron microscope examination, there were no residues of cells found on BECM membrane, of which one side had the reticular fibrous structure, and the other side had the compact structure. The co-culture of BECM membrane with bladder transitional epithelial cells indicated that BECM had a good cytocompatibility. The cytotoxicity score tested by MTT method was number 0 and 1. The rabbits in the implant test had no abnormal response. The BECMs degraded gradually in vivo, and growth of peripheral tissue could be seen in the materials after eight weeks.The BECMs prepared by our process are cell-free under scanning electron microscopy. Meanwhile, the reticular structure of the tissue matrix is well preserved. The BECMs have the good cytocompatibility with transitional epithelial cells but without cytotoxicity. The BECMs can degrade gradually in vivo with good histocompatibility. BECM is a good bio-derived material of tissue engineering as scaffold for urinary tract reconstruction.",

The inhibiting effect of heating on the growth of cells was observed, more significant in the 60 degrees C group than in the 45 degrees C group. The cell phase arrest induced by heat, mainly G0/G1 arrest, was more significant in the 12 h group than in the 1 h group. Heating up-regulated the expressions of heat shock protein 70 and prostate specific antigen in cells.Heating can induce apoptosis, necrosis and growth suppression of the epithelia of benign prostate hyperplasia. Its process and mechanism are correlated with the cell phase arrest and the up-regulation of the expressions of heat shock protein 70 and prostate specific antigen.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the construction of urothelial structure by tissue engineering. Methods Fresh bladder of New Zealand white rabbits were processed to prepare the bladder acellular matrix graft (BAMG) as the scaffold, which was evaluated by Massen's trichrome staining and the scanning electronic microscope. Bladder epithelia were obtained by enzymatic digestion and were proliferated in vitro. Growth of cells was observed under the inverted phase contrast microscope, and cells were identified by immunohistochemical method. The bladder epithelia were seeded on BAMG, and the epithelia/BAMG composites were observed by HE staining and the scanning electronic microscope. The composites fabricated in vitro were implanted into nude rats, and were retrieved in 4 and 8 weeks, which were observed by general observation, histological and immunohistochemical method. Results White semi-transparent membrane appeared in the prepared BAMG, and a fibre mesh structure of the material without residual cells was observed under the scanning electronic microscope. Bladder epithelia cultured in vitro showed a paving stone structure. Immunohistochemical staining with cytokeratin was performed, and brown cellular plasm staining was observed as positive reaction. After the epithelia were seeded on BAMG in vitro for 7 days, the cells fully covered the surface of the framework, showing a single-layer cellular structure. After being implanted into nude rats for 4 weeks and 8 weeks, the epithelia seeded on the BAMG formed a multi-layer structure. Conclusion Urothelial structures can be constructed in vitro and in vivo by tissue engineering, which lays a technical foundation for further tissue engineered urinary tract reconstruction experiments.",

And the cell line that could express UPRT gene stably was selected with antibiotic G418. The various percentages of prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) transfected and non-transfected were mixed to observe the bystander effect of suicide gene system UPRT/5-FU.The cell line that could express UPRT gene stably was screened successfully. With the LNCaP cells that expressed UPRT gene becoming more and more, the cell survival rate went down gradually. No obvious bystander effect showed after using UPRT/5-FU suicide gene system.pPSMA enhancer/promoter-UPRT/5-FU suicide gene system kills LNCaP cells in target, UPRT can transform 5-FU into toxic metabolites quickly and play the role of cytotoxicity. However, the bystander effect of UPRT/5-FU isn't obvious. It will be studied further for UPRT/5-FU how to strengthen the cytotoxic role by improving the bystander effect.",

        "abstract": "To determine whether smaller tumor size is associated with less-aggressiveness in renal cell carcinoma (RCC).Series records of 505 patients diagnosed with RCC were retrospectively reviewed and the data concerning tumor size and pathological information were extracted and analyzed.Five hundred and eight RCCs were identified. The mean tumor size was 5.02 \u00b1 2.70 cm. No correlation was detected between the size of tumor and the histological subtype. The overall nuclear grade distribution was 57.1% and 42.9% for low-grade and high-grade disease, respectively. Each 1 cm increase in tumor size was associated with a significant increase in the odds ratio of high-grade disease by 1.46. 91.1% were found low-stage lesions and the odds ratio for the association of high-stage disease with each 1 cm increase in tumor size was 1.67. Multinomial models revealed that each 1 cm increase in the tumor size was associated with a 35% increase in renal capsule involvement and 66% renal vascular invasion. The cut-off point of tumor size in renal vascular invasion was 5.6 cm.Tumor size is not an independent predictor for the histological subtype of RCC. However, it is closely correlated to histopathological features, with the indications that the greater the tumor size, the more aggressive potential the RCC is.",

At present, no ideal substitute material has been found, so the scholars overseas consider reconstructing tunica albuginea with the acellular extracellular matrix. Objective: To conduct a dynamic observation of the reconstruction of tunica albuginea in New Zealand rabbits with bladder acellular matrix grafts. Design, time and setting: From December 2005 to June 2007, a randomized controlled animal experiment was carried out in the West China Experimental Animal Center and the Tissue Engineering Laboratory of Sichuan University, as well as the Tissue Engineering Laboratory of Guiyang Medical College. Materials: Fifty New Zealand male rabbits were adopted, weighing 2.6-3.0 kg, and 10 of them were used for the preparation of bladder acellular grafts. Methods: The other 40 rabbits were at random divided into control group and bladder acellular matrix graft group, with 20 animals in each group. A defect area of 10 mm \u00d7 5 mm was induced in those rabbits, and repaired with orthotopic suture of tunica albuginea or bladder acellular matrix grafts, respectively. Main outcome measures: At postoperative weeks 2, 6, 12 and 24, an penile erection was induced by a rapid intracavernosal injection with saline into 5 rabbits at each time point, to observe penile curvature; Then rabbits were sacrificed, followed by hematoxylin-eosin, Masson and sirius red stain. Protein expression of the inflammatory markers inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) was evaluated; Image collection system was used to measure the area of collagen fiber. Results: The incidence of penile deviation was the highest at 6 weeks and then reduced gradually, and only 1 case of slight penile deviation was observed in control group at 24 weeks. Collagen I and III occupied equally the grafting site 2 weeks postoperatively; After that, the collage I increased evidently (P < 0.05) and collagen III decreased gradually (P < 0.05). Collagen I occupied mostly the grafting site at 24 weeks, while collagen III was not observed. Expression of iNOS and TGF-\u03b21 was the highest at 2 weeks and precipitously decreased at 6 weeks. Conclusion: The bladder acellular matrix grafts demonstrate good histocompatibility in the repair of tunica albuginea in New Zealand rabbits, does not stimulate significant inflammatory response or cause fibrosis, so it is an ideal material for the tunica albuginea repair.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the value of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) examination of urine exfoliative cells in the diagnosis of urinary bladder neoplasms. Methods: The urine samples were collected from 100 patients with suspected urinary bladder neoplasms and 20 normal control subjects. Both FISH examination and cytology study of urine exfoliative cells were conducted with each sample. The specificity and sensitivity of FISH and cytology were analyzed on the basis of bladder biopsy histology. Results: The sensitivity of FISH examination of bladder malignant tumor was 93. 5% (87/93), which was much higher than that of cytology (49. 5% ,46/93). Biopsies confirmed 88 cases of urothelial carcinoma among the 100 suspected patients, with 46 high grade tumors and 42 low grade tumors; 30 cases of high stage(T 2-4) and 58 cases of low stage (T a-i). The sensitivity of FISH examination of urothelial carcinoma was 94. 3%, which was much higher than that of cytology (52. 3%). FISH examination was significantly more sensitive than cytology for low grade and low stage urothelial carcinoma, as well as for rare non-urothelial malignancies (P<0. 05). The specificity of FISH and cytology of bladder malignancies was 92. 6%(25/27) and 96. 3% (26/27), for urothelial carcinoma was 81. 3% (26/32) and 96.9% (31/32), respectively. Conclusion: FISH shows high sensitivity and relatively high specificity for the detection of urinary bladder neoplasms, especially for the diagnosis of low grade urothelial carcinoma and non-urothelial malignancies, which were difficult to be detected by cytology.",

Methods: A total of 60 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia undergoing TURP were divided into two groups: 30 patients were pretreated with epristeride 5 mg x 2 daily for 7 to 11 days before TURP, and 30 patients did not receive any pretreatment. The operations for the two groups of patients were conducted by the same doctors. The operation time, the weight of resected prostatictissue, and the volume of irrigating fluid were recorded. Blood loss, bleeding index, and bleeding intensity were calculated. Microvessel density (MVD), vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), and nitricoxide synthase type III (eNOS) expression were measured by the immunohistochemistry SP method in prostatic tissue. Results: In the epristeride and control groups, the mean blood loss was 179.51\u00b178.29 ml and 237.95\u00b1124.38 ml (P<0.05); the mean bleeding index was 7.68\u00b13.94 ml/g and 9.73 \u00b13.42 ml/g (P<0.05); the mean bleeding intensity was 2.43\u00b1 1.03 ml/min and 3.30\u00b11.50 ml/min (P<0.05); the mean value of MVD was 18.80\u00b15.68 and 23.70\u00b14.91 (P<0.05); the mean rank of VEGF was 23.48 and 31.77 (P<0.05); and the mean rank of eNOS was 22.36 and 31.14 (P<0.05), respectively. Conclusion: Pretreatment with epristeride decreases intraoperative bleeding during TURP. The preliminary results suggest that angiogenesis in the prostatictissue is suppressed.",

The protein expressions of CD(3), CD(28) and IL-2 were measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and ELISA analysis. ZAP70 and PI3K protein expression in CD(4)(+) T cells activated by CD(3) and CD(28) monoclonal antibody were analyzed by Western blotting.TSA dose-dependently inhibited the transcription and protein expression of CD28 in CD(4)(+) T cells and reduced the expression of PI3K protein in activated CD(4)(+) T cells, without showing significant effect on the expression of ZAP70. TSA treatment of the cells also resulted in significantly decreased mRNA and protein expressions of IL-2 (P<0.01).TSA can regulate the immunological activity of CD(4)(+) T cells by inducing mRNA and protein expressions of CD(28), which inhibits the activation of the co-stimulatory signal transduction in CD(4)(+) T cells and decreases the secretion of IL-2.",

Recombinant adenoviruses (Ad-PSMA(E-P)-enhanced green fluorescent protein [EGFP], Ad-CMV-EGFP, Ad-PSMA(E-P)-CD, and Ad-CMV-CD) were constructed and could express cytosine deaminase (CD) or the EGFP reporter gene driven by a PSMA(EP) or cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. LNCaP, CL-1, MCF-7, and A549 were infected with CD-produced recombinant adenoviruses and treated with pro-drug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) in vivo and vitro; then, the growth inhibition of the cells and the cell cycle variation were assessed by an [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] (MTT) assay and flow cytometry. Growth suppression of the xenograft tumor was also adopted to evaluate the efficiency of the suicide system. Morphologic changes after treatment in vivo were assessed with hematoxylin and eosin staining. In the 4 examined cancer cell lines, PSMA-positive prostate cancer cells LNCap and CL-1 were exclusively sensitive to the Ad-PSMA(E-P)-CD/5-FC system. The S phase of cell cycle arrest was thought to be involved in the cytotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) converted from 5-FC by CD. CL-1 implanted Athymic BALB/c mice showed growth inhibition of tumors when they were treated with the Ad-PSMA(E-P)-CD/5-FC system without systemic conversion toxicity. The PSMA-based, CD-produced adenovirus, deserving further investigation in the future, might be a good candidate for targeting gene therapy of prostate adenocarcinoma.",

Male BALB/C-nu mice bearing PC-3 prostate cancer were treated with docetaxol and retinoic acid singly or synergistically, followed by measurement of the body weight and immunohistochemical examination of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) and PSA expression in the implanted tumors.GE at the concentration of 1 x 10(-8) mol/L significantly enhanced the effect of PA above 1 x 10(-7) mol/L in inducing growth inhibition (with an inhibition rate over 50.8%+/-4.2%, P<0.05) and apoptosis (apoptosis rate over 22.9%+/-2.3%, P<0.05) of PC-3 cells and in down-regulating the expression of cyclin D1 (expression rate no higher than 9.6%+/-1.6%, P<0.01) in PC-3 cells. GE lowered the rate of PA-induced cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M phase from 70.3%+/-9.7% to 38.2%+/-4.2%, and partially reversed the G(2)/M arrest (P<0.01). Synergistic treatment of the tumor-bearing mice caused little change in the body weight, but the serum PSA (51+/-14 ng/ml), implanted tumor mass (3.2+/-0.5 g) and PSA expression in the tumors (30%+/-3.7%) were all decreased significantly in comparison with the control mice (21.6+/-1.7 g).GE can enhance PA-induced tumor cell growth suppression and apoptosis in a synergistic manner both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting their great potential in clinical treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer.",

The database search, quality assessment, and data extraction were independently performed by 2 reviewers. Heterogeneity was analyzed using the chi-square test and I(2) test. If lacking of heterogeneity, fixed-effects models were used for the meta-analysis, otherwise random-effects models were used.A total of 5 studies (11 randomized controlled trials) were identified from the search strategy. Compared with placebo, short-term trials (\u226412 weeks) indicated that PDE-5 inhibitors significantly improved the International Prostate Symptom Score (mean difference -2.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.12 to -2.07; P < .00001), and statistical significance was observed in the International Prostate Symptom Score irritative and obstructive subscore, International Prostate Symptom Score quality of life and erectile function. However, no statistically significant difference was detected in maximal urinary flow rate (mean difference 0.21, 95% CI -0.21-0.64; P = .32) and postvoid residual urine volume (mean difference 0.09, 95% CI -4.71-4.89; P = .80). No statistically significant difference was found between the 2 groups in the incidence of serious adverse events (relative risk 0.52, 95% CI 0.25-1.07; P = .07), despite that adverse event with a greater incidence was detected in the PDE-5 group (relative risk 1.87, 95% CI 1.31-2.68; P = .0005).As the first-line treatment of erectile dysfunction, the PDE-5 inhibitor is also effective and safe for lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia. It could be considered as the first-line treatment in the future for the treatment of patients with comorbid benign prostatic hyperplasia and erectile dysfunction.",

However, the seminal vesicle is difficult to access surgically, and current transurethral or open surgical approaches have inherent shortcomings. The laparoscopic techniques developed in the last decade may overcome the difficulties in the surgical treatment of seminal vesicle pathology. In this study we report a patient diagnosed with left seminal vesicle cyst and ipsilateral renal agenesis who was managed successfully through the laparoscopic approach. The patient was a 41-year-old who suffered from perineal pain and intermittent hemospermia for 20 years. Ultrasonography and computerized tomography, CT, indicated a cyst of the left seminal vesicle and an absent left kidney. The total laparoscopic operation time was 90 minutes and the estimated blood loss was 80 ml. With a follow-up of 13 months, the patient had total relief of his preoperative symptoms without complication.",

        "abstract": "To reveal the correlation between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) histologic inflammation and serum prostate-specific antigen (sPSA) concentrations, and the possible mechanism.Patients underwent surgery at the Urology Department of West China Hospital of Sichuan University were retrospectively studied. Preoperative sPSA and transrectal ultrasonography were measured. According to the histopathological classification system for chronic prostatic inflammation proposed by the Chronic Prostatitis Collaborative Research Network (CPCRN) and the International Prostatitis Collaborative Network (IPCN), we classified the histologic sections of prostatic biopsy into glandular, periglandular, and stromal inflammation by the anatomical location of inflammatory infiltration. The glandular inflammation was graded according to the inflammatory aggressiveness. The periglandular and stromal inflammation were graded according to the inflammatory density. The correlation between histologic inflammation and sPSA was studied by a multiple regression model in conjunction with age and total prostatic volume.A total of 454 patients with exclusively BPH were analyzed. The periglandular inflammatory infiltration was the most common pattern (95.6%). Single regression analysis revealed that total prostatic volume, the aggressiveness of glandular inflammation, and the intensity of periglandular and stromal inflammation were correlated with sPSA. However, the multiple regression analysis revealed that only the total prostatic volume and the aggressiveness of glandular inflammation were correlated significantly with sPSA (R = .389, 0.289; P = .000).The aggressiveness of glandular inflammatory infiltration in BPH is a significant contributor to elevated sPSA levels. The theory of leakage may be the most reasonable mechanism to reveal the correlation morphologically. We should take inflammation into consideration when interpreting the abnormal elevating of sPSA levels.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the efficacy of interleukin-8 (IL-8) as a possible biomarker for diagnosis and treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with chronic prostatitis. Histologic inflammation can be demonstrated in most BPH pathologic specimens. To provide objective parameters of inflammation, this prospective study quantified the IL-8 in expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) from BPH patients with or without histologic inflammation.White blood cell (WBC) count and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of the EPS for IL-8 were done in 44 patients who underwent transurethral prostatic resection because of benign prostatic enlargement before the operations. The correlation between IL-8 and WBC count in EPS; prostatic specific antigen; and International Prostate Symptom Score, irritative, and obstructive subscores was determined by Pearson correlation analysis.IL-8 was detectable in all patients (the threshold of detection for IL-8 is 5 pg/mL). Twenty-one (47.7%) BPH patients had chronic prostatitis. The mean level of IL-8 in EPS was higher in BPH with chronic prostatitis than in simple BPH (median +/- SE, 8175 +/- 3789 pg/mL vs 2806 +/- 1009 pg/mL). The catheter and age seemed to have no impact on the level of IL-8 in EPS. Statistically significant correlation was only found between IL-8 and WBC count. The sensitivity and specificity of IL-8 in EPS identifying the BPH with chronic prostatitis from the simple BPH were 85.7% and 91.3% respectively, at a cut-point of 3992 pg/mL.IL-8 is significantly elevated in BPH patients with chronic prostatitis. IL-8 in EPS can serve as a reliable biomarker applicable to identifying BPH with chronic prostatitis from simple BPH.",

Outcomes were success rate, complications, operative time, conversion, presence of a crossing vessel, and length of hospital stay. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed quality. Meta-analysis used both fixed and random effects models with dichotomous data reported as relative risk and continuous data as a weighted mean difference with 95% confidence intervals.One RCT and eight CCTs were identified (reporting 776 participants). Meta-analysis showed that TLP was associated with an operative time reduction of about 40 minutes (weighted mean difference -43.85, 95% confidence interval -58.06 to -27.63; P<.00001) and significantly lower conversion rate (relative risk [RR] 0.39, 95% confidence interval 0.21-0.74; P=.004) compared with RLP. The two approaches were similar in terms of presence of a crossing vessel (RR 1.24, 95% confidence interval 0.83-1.86; P=.28), length of hospital stay (weighted mean difference -0.24, 95% confidence interval -0.75 to 0.26; P=.35), success rate (RR 1.03, 95% confidence interval 0.97-1.09; P=.76), and complications (RR 0.83, 95% confidence interval 0.17-1.26; P=.61).LP as a minimally invasive treatment for UPJO can be performed through both the transperitoneal and retroperitoneal approaches, and either approach is associated with a high success rate and a low complication rate, although TLP provides a shorter operative time and lower conversion rate.",

The primary parameters were recurrence rate, the time to fist recurrence, recurrence free survival rate (RFS) and progression rate.12 RCTs including 2258 patients, which were identified for analysis in our study. Our study showed that the FC group have lower recurrence rate than the white light cystoscopy (WLC) group with statistically significant difference (OR: 0.5; p<0.00001). The time of the FC group first recurrence delayed significantly 7.39 weeks than WLC group (MD: 7.39 weeks; p<0.0001). There was a statistically significant difference in favor of FC in RFS at 1 yr (HR: 0.69; p<0.00001) and 2 yrs (HR: 0.65; p=0.0004). However, the FC group cannot significantly reduce the rate of progression into muscle invasive bladder cancer compared with the WLC group (OR: 0.85; p=0.39).FC guided TUR was demonstrated to be an effective procedure for delaying recurrence of NMIBC. Unfortunately, FC guided TUR could not significantly decrease the rate of progression into muscle invasive bladder cancer.",

Partial cystectomy was performed in the experimental and control group. Bladder defects were repaired with HUMSCs-BAMG in the experimental group and repaired with unseeded-BAMG in control group. The implanted grafts were harvested after surgery. H&E and immunohistochemistry staining were performed to evaluate the regeneration of the bladder defect. Primary cultured HUMSCs displayed typical fibroblast morphology with spindle-shaped. Flow cytometry indicated that these cells were positive for CD105 (97.3%) and CD44 (99%), but negative for CD34 (2.8%), CD31 (2.1%), and CD45 (1.7%). Immunohistochemistry staining showed that a multilayered urothelium and well-developed smooth muscle were observed at 12 weeks in experiment group. In contrast, multilayered urothelial tissues were also observed at 12 weeks in group B, but well-developed smooth muscle bundles were observed.Our preliminary results demonstrate that UMSC-seeded BAMGs are superior to unseeded BAMGs to promote the regeneration of bladder defects. Our findings indicated that HUMSCs may be a potential cell source for bladder tissue engineering.",

        "abstract": "Currently, the laparoscopic technique is widely used for living donor nephrectomy. Does it provides adequate safety and benefits for the living donor? We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN) as well as an analysis of postoperative quality of life compared with the open donor nephrectomy (ODN).Eligible studies were identified from electronic databases: Cochrane CENTRAL, PubMed, and EMBASE as of October 2011. Relevant parameters explored by-using Review Manager V5.0 included operative time, warm ischemia time, intraoperative blood loss, hospital stay and time to return to work.Compared with ODN, LDN showed a shorter hospital stay (days; mean difference [MD]: -1.27, P < .00001) and time to return to work (days; MD: -16.35, P < .00001), less intraoperative blood loss (ml; MD: -101.23, P = .0001) without an increase among donor intraoperative and postoperative complications or compromise of recipient graft function. Hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (HLDN) showed a shorter warm ischemia time (minutes) than the standard laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (MD: -1.02, P < .00001). We also observed that hospital stay (days) significantly favored SLDN compared with HLDN (MD: 0.33, P < .005), but operative times, intraoperative estimated blood loss, and donor postoperative complications were not significantly different between them. Donor postoperative quality of life revealed only physical functioning and bodily pain scores to significantly favor LDN.LDN is a safe surgical procedure for a living donor.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical anesthetic agents for patients with premature ejaculation (PE).Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, and EMBASE) without language restrictions. The database search, quality assessment, and data extraction were performed independently by 2 reviewers. The main outcome for the efficacy of topical anesthetic agents was intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT). Efficacy and safety were explored using Review Manager, version 5.1.0 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK).Eight trials met the inclusion criteria. Our pooled analysis showed that IELT in the topical anesthetic agent group was significantly improved compared to the placebo group (random-effect model; mean difference [MD] 5.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.50-8.14, P <.00001). According to the subgroup analysis, a significant improvement was obtained in the domains of ejaculatory control, sexual satisfaction, and distress in the Index of Premature Ejaculation (IPE) questionnaire (random-effect model, MD 4.53, 95% CI 3.05-6.01, P <.00001). In terms of adverse events (AEs), the pooling outcome showed that the overall incidence of AEs was significantly higher in the topical anesthetic agent group than in the placebo group (random-effect model, relative risk [RR] 4.28, 95% CI 1.63-11.24, P = .003). However, nearly all of the AEs were mild and transient.Topical anesthetic agents have been shown to be effective and well tolerated for patients with primary PE, providing a significant improvement in IELT with a higher incidence of AEs that were not long-lasting or severe. High-quality RCTs are necessary to confirm the efficacy and safety of topical anesthetics for PE.",

All relevant studies on the outcomes and complications of PDE5i in the treatment of ED after radiotherapy for PCa were assessed. The outcomes and complications analyzed for this study included the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire, Global Efficacy Questions (GEQs), Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) diary and side effects. The Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager software (RevMan 5.1.4) was used for statistical analysis of the outcomes and complications.A total of 4 RCTs were identified from the search strategy. Compared with placebo, the trials indicated that PDE5i significantly improved the IIEF scores, with the exception of two questions (questions 6 and 13), and statistically significantly more positive answers for the GEQs and SEP diary were acquired in intervention groups. Furthermore, almost all the side effects in both groups were mild or moderate, transient and well tolerated. Except for headache, flushing and dyspepsia, all other adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups.The systematic review suggested significant advantages in the efficacy and safety of PDE5i in the treatment of ED after radiotherapy for PCa. PDE5i should be considered as the first choice for the treatment of PCa patients with ED after radiotherapy.",

We performed a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing an alpha-blocker plus muscarinic antagonist with an alpha-blocker alone in male LUTS patients who were treated with alpha-blocker prior to randomisation. The review contained six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included a total of 2,208 male patients who were randomised to receive alpha-blocker plus muscarinic antagonist or alpha-blocker alone. The add-on group experienced significantly greater improvement in both total IPSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) and storage IPSS. Adverse events (AEs) were commonly experienced by both groups (41.6 vs. 33.3%) though they were not severe. Our meta-analysis indicated that muscarinic antagonists as add-on therapy alleviate LUTS, especially storage symptoms. The add-on therapy demonstrated safety and tolerability comparable with alpha-blocker monotherapy in male with LUTS.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the biocompatibility of rabbit bladder extracellular matrix (BECM) and evaluate the feasibility of using BECM as scaffold for reconstruction of tissue engineering urinary tract. Methods By the application of associating the solution diosmosis, enzymatic digestion with chemical detergent, the rabbit bladder was decellularized to prepare the BECM, on which rabbit bladder transitional epithelial cells were cultured and seeded in vitro, of which the adhesion and proliferation were observed. MTT method was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of BECM, which was implanted into the rabbit back for evaluating its histocompatibility meant that the toxicity, degradation and local inflammatory response were studied through gross observation and HE staining. Results The prepared rabbit BECMs were freeze-drying, and looked like thin semitransparent membrane. By electron microscope examination, there were no residues of cells found on BECM membrane, of which one side had the reticular fibrous structure, and the other side had the compact structure. The co-culture of BECM membrane with bladder transitional epithelial cells indicated that BECM had a good cytocompatibility. The cytotoxicity score tested by MTT method was number 0 and 1. The rabbits in the implant test had no abnormal response. The BECMs degraded gradually in vivo, and growth of peripheral tissue could be seen in the materials after eight weeks. Conclusion The BECMs prepared by our process are cell-free under scanning electron microscopy. Meanwhile, the reticular structure of the tissue matrix is well preserved. The BECMs have the good cytocompatibility with transitional epithelial cells but without cytotoxicity. The BECMs can degrade gradually in vivo with good histocompatibility. BECM is a good bio-derived material of tissue engineering as scaffold for urinary tract reconstruction.",

The meta-analysis was performed to supply the best evidence about use of this class of drugs in CP/CPPS. A fully recursive literature search to June 2005 was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and the Chinese Biomedicine Database to identify potentially relevant randomized controlled trials. RevMan4.2 was used for statistical analysis. Nine studies with 734 patients were included. Combined analysis showed a significant reduction of total NIH-CPSI or I-PSS in patients with treatment duration of more than 3 months. There were also valuable results in urinary symptom alleviation. Alpha-adrenergic antagonists did not show benefit in pain.

The meta-analysis was performed to supply the best evidence about use of this class of drugs in CP/CPPS. A fully recursive literature search to June 2005 was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and the Chinese Biomedicine Database to identify potentially relevant randomized controlled trials. RevMan4.2 was used for statistical analysis. Nine studies with 734 patients were included. Combined analysis showed a significant reduction of total NIH-CPSI or I-PSS in patients with treatment duration of more than 3 months. There were also valuable results in urinary symptom alleviation.

        "abstract": "Abstract  Background  The role of local therapy for the management of oligometastatic prostate cancer at diagnosis still remains poorly defined. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating local therapy of the primary tumour for patients with oligometastatic prostate cancer at diagnosis as well as the patients who can benefit the most.  Methods  For this systematic review, we searched PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, and the Cochrane Library for studies from database inception until March, 2016, for local therapy of the primary tumour in patients with oligometastatic prostate cancer. No language restrictions were applied. We estimated the risk of bias for the individual research studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). We assessed the publication bias using both the Eggeru0027s linear regression approach and funnel plots. The baseline characteristics on trial, patient, and treatment level were extracted. The primary outcomes were overall survival and disease-specific survival. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata v.12.0 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).  Findings  Seven retrospective studies were selected for inclusion, including a total of 24\u2008203 patients who were recruited from 1989 to 2010 form Sweden, USA, and Germany. For overall survival, the pooled hazard ratio (HR) in patients treated with local therapy compared with no local therapy was 0\u00b753 (95% CI 0\u00b740\u20130\u00b771; p   Interpretation  Local therapy for a primary tumour conferred a significantly better outcome in fit patients with oligometastatic prostate cancer at diagnosis. The evidence also suggests that radical prostatectomy is a preferable local therapy procedure for patients aged 65 years or younger or for those who have an AJCC stage M1a tumour. We believe that important local therapy factors should be systematically assessed to develop a personalised approach to improve patient survival  Funding  This study was supported by the Prostate Cancer Foundation Young Investigator Award 2013, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81300627 and 81370855) and Programs from Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province (2013SZ0006 and 2014JY0219).",

        "title": "Aspirin and levofloxacin for the prevention of the occurrence of prostate cancer or transformation to castration-resistant prostate cancer: a two-part, open-label, randomised, controlled study",
        "abstract": "Abstract  Background  The role that inflammation plays in the development of prostate cancer is unknown. We aimed to assess whether an anti-inflammatory drug or antibiotic, or both, could prevent prostate cancer occurrence and delay transformation to castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Methods  This open-label, randomised, controlled trial recruited participants who had undergone a prostate biopsy in West China Hospital of Sichuan University. Participants older than 40 years pathologically confirmed not to have prostate cancer but who had a prostate with inflammatory cell infiltration were assigned to the prostate cancer prevention (PCP) trial, and those older than 50 years who had pathological results of prostate cancer and were suitable for only androgen-deprivation therapy were assigned to the castration-resistant prostate cancer prevention (C-RPCP) trial. We excluded patients with haematological disease, gastrointestinal disease, and mental illness. Participants in both phases were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to a blank control group (no intervention), aspirin (100 mg/day until diagnosis or progression), levofloxacin (500 mg/day for 4 weeks), or aspirin plus levofloxacin. The coprimary outcomes were the number of newly diagnosed patients with prostate cancer and castration-resistant prostate cancer, and the durations from benign disease to malignancy and from androgen-dependent prostate cancer to castration-resistant prostate cancer, analysed by intention to treat. Patients were followed up for 2 years or until prostate cancer diagnosis or castration-resistant prostate cancer diagnosis. All participants provided written informed consent. The trial was approved by the hospitalu0027s clinical trials and biomedical ethics committee. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02757365.  Findings  Between May 1, 2014, and April 30, 2016, we recruited 53 patients for the PCP trial (24 assigned to control, ten to aspirin, 12 to levofloxacin, and seven to aspirin plus levofloxacin) and 80 patients for the C-RPCP trial (17 assigned to control, 22 to aspirin, 23 to levofloxacin, and 18 to aspirin plus levofloxacin). Median follow-up time was 13\u00b703 months (IQR 7\u00b707\u201319\u00b747) for patients in the PCP trial and 18\u00b717 months (11\u00b740\u201322\u00b734) for patients in the C-RPCP trial. In the PCP phase, none of the participants were pathologically proven to have prostate cancer at study end; therefore, the period from benign prostatic hyperplasia to prostate cancer did not differ between treatment groups (p=0\u00b7378). In the C-RPCP phase, the proportion of patients who developed castration-resistant prostate cancer did not significantly differ between groups (five [29%] with control, three [14%] with aspirin, three [13%] with levofloxacin, and three [17%] with aspirin plus levofloxacin; p=0\u00b7527). The median time from androgen-dependent prostate cancer to castration-resistant prostate cancer was 21\u00b753 months (IQR 12\u00b783\u201321\u00b780) in the control group, 21\u00b700 months (20\u00b750\u201321\u00b799) in the aspirin group, 16\u00b753 months (14\u00b768\u201317\u00b700) in the levofloxacin group, and 25\u00b700 months (21\u00b702\u201325\u00b700) in the aspirin plus levofloxacin group (p=0\u00b7222). In the C-RPCP phase, seven (41%) patients reported tumour-associated adverse events in the control group, compared with six (27%) with aspirin, five (22%) with levofloxacin, and eight (44%) with aspirin plus levofloxacin. Two (9%) patients on aspirin had drug-associated adverse effects compared with none in any of the other groups. No patients had serious complications and withdrew from the study because of adverse effects.  Interpretation  Our data do not show that aspirin or levofloxacin help to decrease the incidence of prostate cancer occurrence, delay castration-resistant prostate cancer transformation, or reduce tumour-associated death. A longer period of follow-up and a larger number of patients are needed to draw final conclusions.

        "abstract": "Abstract  Background  The introduction of three kinds of MRI-guided prostate biopsies (MRI-PB) has changed the model of practice regarding prostate biopsies. The most appropriate strategy is still unknown, we therefore aimed to compare and rank prostate biopsies strategies.  Methods  We did a network meta-analysis to incorporate both direct and indirect evidence from relevant trials. We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, Embase, and the reference lists of relevant articles for randomised controlled trials published up to Sept 1, 2016, of different strategies for prostate biopsy. Involved studies were full text reports of randomised trials that compared different biopsy strategies, and reported efficacy endpoints. The primary outcome was overall prostate cancer detection rate. We did pairwise meta-analyses by random effects model and network meta-analysis by Bayesian random effects model. We assessed the quality of evidence contributing to each network estimate using the GRADE framework. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42016044011.  Findings  From a total of 3616 citations, 24 randomised trials with a total of 6497 participants were included in this network meta-analysis. We considered 11 strategies of prostate biopsy published between 2000 and 2016. Cognitive MRI prostate biopsy was significantly better (relative risk [RR] 2\u00b766, 95% credible interval [CrI] 1\u00b744\u20134\u00b772) than TRUS (10-12; PCa detection from 10\u201312 needle core transrectal ultrasound prostate biopsy) prostate biopsy considering overall prostate cancer detection rate. Detection rates of clinically significant and insignificant prostate cancers suggested no significant difference between any group of all biopsy techniques.  Interpretation  Although cognitive MRI prostate biopsy obtained better detection rates of overall prostate cancer than did TRUS (10-12) prostate biopsy, it had no remarkable advantages in detection of clinically significant and insignificant prostate cancers. Nevertheless, these results should be considered together with all known safety and economy information when selecting the strategy for individual patients.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Background  The effectiveness of medical expulsive therapy for the non-invasive management of patients with ureteral calculi has been called into question. We aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of various medical expulsive therapies using a systematic review and network meta-analysis.    Methods  We incorporated both direct and indirect evidence from relevant trials. We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, Embase, and the reference lists of relevant articles for randomised controlled trials published up to Oct 1, 2016, of medical expulsive therapy. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who did not need further intervention for stone clearance within 4 weeks of randomisation, stone expulsion rate, stone expulsion time, and adverse events. We did pairwise meta-analyses by random effects model and network meta-analysis by Bayesian random effects model. We assessed the quality of evidence contributing to each network estimate using the GRADE framework. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number 42016051277.    Findings  From a total of 1873 citations, 65 randomised trials with a total of 10\u2008493 participants were included in this network meta-analysis. 14 strategies for medical expulsive therapy published between 2000 and 2016 were considered. Tamsulosin plus tadalafil (relative risk [RR] 7\u00b731, 95% credible interval [CrI] 1\u00b783\u201314\u00b737), surface under the cumulative ranking curve [SUCRA], 0\u00b790) was ranked the best, followed by alfuzosin (6\u00b750, 3\u00b750\u201312\u00b72, SUCRA 0\u00b781), tadalafil (6\u00b739, 2\u00b715\u201310\u00b702, SUCRA 0\u00b777), doxazosin (6\u00b713, 3\u00b750\u201311\u00b75, SUCRA 0\u00b775), and tamsulosin (5\u00b789, 1\u00b750\u20139\u00b742, SUCRA 0\u00b769) considering stone expulsion rate. Alfuzosin showed significant superiority over nifedipine (RR 6\u00b719, 95% CrI 2\u00b772\u201313\u00b757) and ramsulosin (2\u00b719, 1\u00b718\u20134\u00b704) in terms of stone expulsion rate. Tamsulosin plus tadalafil was significantly more effective than nifedipine (standardised mean difference [SMD] \u22120\u00b789, 95 % CI \u22121\u00b719 to \u22120\u00b760), Tamsulosin (\u22122\u00b736, \u22124\u00b761 to \u22120\u00b781), and placebo (SMD \u22123\u00b720, \u22125\u00b719 to \u22122\u00b721) in terms of stone expulsion time. No significant difference between any group of medical expulsive therapy was found in terms of further intervention need for stone clearance and adverse events. Out results showed the same significance in the subgroup analysis of stone size ( vs  u003e5 mm) and stone location (upper and lower ureteral).    Interpretation  In adults with ureteral stones smaller than 10 mm in size, tamsulosin plus tadalafil and alfuzosin are safe and effective for expulsive therapy. Nevertheless, these results should be considered together with all known safety and economic information when selecting the strategy for individual patients. Head-to-head comparisons of medical expulsive therapy are limited, but still needed to confirm the findings.

However, the mechanisms underlying these processes remain unclear. Thus, we chose IL-8 as the bridge between inflammation and cancer cell oxidative stress-induced death and confirmed its connection with mTOR and GSK-3beta. Methods: We overexpressed GSK-3beta and observed the effect of GSK-3beta on reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell death induced by oxidative stress. Then, IL-8 was upregulated or downregulated to determine its impact on preventing cells from damage by GSK-3beta-induced oxidative stress. In addition, we confirmed the role of mTOR in this process through its overexpression or knockdown. Real-time PCR, Western blotting, transcription, Cell Counting Kit 8, flow cytometry and other techniques were used. Results: IL-8 promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation and decreases apoptosis, while GSK-3beta induces cell death by oxidative stress through the activation of t...",

We performed a meta-analysis based on well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the diagnostic accuracy of MRI/TRUS fusion TB and systematic biopsy (SB) in the detection of PCa in biopsy-naive men. Methods: A systematic review of PubMed (Medline), Embase, Ovid and the Cochrane Library up to 1st October, 2018 was conducted. The statistical analyses were performed with Revman 5.3. We compared the diagnostic accuracy between the intervention group (assisted with fusion TB) and the control group (SB only) by calculating the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of overall PCa and clinically significant PCa (csPCa) DRs.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are considered an indispensable component of the tumor microenvironment, participating in the progress of tumor microenvironment remodeling and creating various compounds to regulate tumor activities. This study aims to observe enriched TAMs in tumor tissues during the bladder cancer development, which markedly facilitated the proliferation of bladder cancer cells and promoted tumor growth in vivo. We determined that TAMs regulate the tumor sustained growth by secreting type I collagen, which can activate the prosurvival integrin \u03b12\u03b21/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Furthermore, traditional chemotherapeutic drugs combined with integrin \u03b12\u03b21 inhibitor exhibited intensive anticancer effects, revealing an innovative approach in the clinical bladder cancer treatment.

        "abstract": "Biochemical recurrence (BCR) is important for measuring the oncological outcomes of patients who undergo radical prostatectomy (RP). Whether transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) has negative postoperative effects on oncological outcomes remains controversial. The primary aim of our retrospective study was to determine whether a history of TURP could affect the postoperative BCR rate. We retrospectively reviewed patients with prostate cancer (PCa) who had undergone RP between January 2009 and October 2017. Clinical data on age, prostate volume, serum prostate-specific antigen levels (PSA), biopsy Gleason score (GS), metastasis stage (TNM), D'Amico classification, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification were collected. Statistical analyses including Cox proportional hazard models and sensitivity analyses which included propensity score matching, were performed, and the inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighted estimator and standardized mortality ratio-weighted estimator were determined. We included 1083 patients, of which 118 had a history of TURP. Before matching, the non-TURP group differed from the TURP group with respect to GS (P= 0.047), prostate volume (mean: 45.19 vs 36.00 ml, P < 0.001), and PSA level (mean: 29.41 vs 15.11 ng ml, P= 0.001). After adjusting for age, PSA level, T stage, N stage, M stage, and GS, the TURP group showed higher risk of BCR (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-3.94, P= 0.004). After matching (ratio 1:4), patients who underwent TURP were still more likely to develop BCR according to the adjusted propensity score (HR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.05-3.79, P= 0.034). Among patients with PCa, those with a history of TURP were more likely to develop BCR after RP.",

All patients pathologically diagnosed with AL were examined. The clinical and pathological characteristics, process of diagnosis, and preparation and treatment of all patients, especially patients treated with laparoscopic surgery, were summarized and retrospectively analyzed. From January 2008 to May 2014, 8 patients underwent adrenalectomies and were diagnosed with AL in our hospital. The median age was 45.5 years. All of these patients experienced a smooth adrenalectomy: 7 performed by laparoscopy via a retroperitoneal approach and 1 performed by open surgery. Five were female and the other 3 were male. These patients had unilateral adrenal lesions. Four were located on the right which to be same as the contralateral. In addition, 1 specimen was assayed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), which revealed positive results for CD31, CD34, Factor VIII-related antigen and D2-40, and negative results for cytokeratin AE1/AE3. During a brief follow up, all patients exhibited favorable results without discomfort. AL is a benign lesion with mild bio-behavior and patients are generally asymptomatic. The use of computerized tomography (CT) combined with enhanced CT has a superior advantage in diagnosis. Laparoscopic adrenalectomies that are performed via a retroperitoneal approach would be a very safe and efficient choice for AL treatment. D2-40 can be considered as a specific IHC marker in the pathological diagnosis of AL. However, pheochromocytoma and adrenal tuberculosis should be ruled out before and during the operation. ",

        "abstract": "To assess the prognostic impact of pretreatment albumin-to-alkaline phosphatase ratio (AAPR) in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC), the data of 692 patients, operated between 2003 and 2016 in our center, were retrospectively assessed. The threshold of AAPR was defined as 0.58 by using the receiver-operating curve analysis. Overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. And the univariate and multivariate Cox's regression models were performed to identify independent prognostic predictors. The results showed that AAPR <0.58 was significantly related to higher pT stage and grade, concomitant variant histology, anemia and larger tumor size. Additionally, patients with a lower AAPR had an inferior survival outcomes than those with an AAPR \u22650.58 (all P\u2009<\u20090.001). Multivariate analysis suggested that the lower AAPR was also an independent risk factor for poor OS (HR 1.587, 95%CI: 1.185-2.126; P\u2009=\u20090.002), CSS (HR 1.746, 95%CI: 1.249-2.440; P\u2009=\u20090.001), and RFS (HR 1.337, 95%CI: 1.027-1.739; P\u2009=\u20090.031). Moreover, subgroup analysis demonstrated the lower AAPR was related to worse prognosis in high-grade UTUC patients; but in those with low-grade disease, no relationship between them was observed. In conclusion, our results found that the decreased AAPR was independently related to poor survival outcomes in UTUC patients. Using the AAPR for subclassification of high-grade UTUC seems to further identify a poor prognostic group and contribute to clinical decisions making.",

Anemia was decided by preoperatively measured hemoglobin values based on the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze the relationship between anemia and survival outcomes. The meta-analysis part was performed according to PRISMA guidelines.The median follow-up was 51 (range: 1-168) months. A total of 246 patients had preoperative anemia in our cohort. Anemia was found to be related to high-grade (P\u200a<\u200a.001), sessile architecture (P\u200a=\u200a.001), advanced T stage (P\u200a<\u200a.001), lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (P\u200a=\u200a.006), and worse chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage (P\u200a=\u200a.012). Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that patients with preoperative anemia had worse overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and disease recurrence-free survival (RFS) (all P\u200a<\u200a.001). Multivariable Cox analyses found that anemia was an independent predictor of CSS [hazard ratio (HR) 1.719, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.285-2.300], RFS (HR 1.427, 95% CI: 1.114-1.829) and OS (HR 1.756, 95% CI: 1.353-2.279). Among patients without end-stage renal disease (ESRD, n\u200a=\u200a614), the anemia was also proved to be associated with worse outcomes in multivariable Cox analysis (OS, HR 1.759, 95% CI: 1.353-2.287; CSS, HR 1.726, 95% CI: 1.289-2.311, and RFS, HR 1.431, 95% CI: 1.117-1.837). Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, and the pooled results showed that anemia was also related to worse CSS (HR 2.05, 95% CI: 1.73-2.44), RFS (HR 1.57, 95% CI: 1.30-1.90), and OS (HR 1.53, 95% CI: 1.10-2.13), but not related to intravesical recurrence (HR 1.17, 95% CI: 0.75-1.82).Preoperative anemia was proved to be significantly associated with worse oncologic outcomes in patients with UTUC following RNU.",

However, its effect on upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) patients has not been investigated before. Thus, to explore the impact of Cys-C on survival outcomes in patients undergoing radical nephroureterectomy (RNU), a total of 538 patients with UTUC who underwent RNU between 2005 and 2014 in our center (West China Hospital, Chengdu, China) were included in this study. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between Cys-C and survival outcomes using SPSS version 22.0. The cutoff value of Cys-C was set as 1.4 mg l using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and Youden index. The mean age of patients included was 66.1 \u00b1 11.1 years, and the median follow-up duration was 38 (interquartile range: 19-56) months. Overall, 162 (30.1%) patients had elevated Cys-C, and they were much older and had worse renal function than those with Cys-C <1.4 mg l (both P < 0.001). Meanwhile, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the group with elevated Cys-C had worse cancer-specific survival (CSS, P = 0.001), disease recurrence-free survival (RFS, P = 0.003), and overall survival (OS, P < 0.001). Multivariable Cox analysis suggested that the elevated Cys-C was identified as an independent prognostic predictor of CSS (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.997, 95% confidential interval [CI]: 1.331-2.996), RFS (HR: 1.429, 95% CI: 1.009-2.023), and OS (HR: 1.989, 95% CI: 1.366-2.896). In conclusion, our result revealed that the elevated preoperative serum Cys-C was significantly associated with worse outcomes in UTUC patients undergoing RNU.",

        "abstract": "Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is the most common type of cancer of the bladder and upper urinary tract, and is characterized by a high risk of recurrence and progression. Urine fluorescence  hybridization (FISH) is a technique that detects genetic aberrations in exfoliated cells in the urine, with specific probes for chromosomes 3, 7 and 17 and the p16 gene. To evaluate the diagnostic value of FISH in UC, 119 patients from November 2010 to June 2012 with suspected UC were recruited into a prospective, cross-sectional study and were followed up for 12-30 months. These patients received voided urine cytology and FISH tests, and underwent cystoscopy and/or ureteroscopy as a reference standard. The final diagnoses confirmed 73 patients with UC, located in the bladder, upper urinary tracts or the two. The sensitivity of FISH for detecting UC was superior to cytology, irrespective of tumor grade and stage: Overall, 80.8 vs. 32.9% (P<0.001); low grade, 75.8 vs. 12.1% (P<0.001); high grade, 85 vs. 50% (P<0.005); non-muscle-invasive, 81.1 vs. 28.3% (P<0.001) and muscle-invasive, 80 vs. 45% (P<0.05), respectively. The specificities of the two tests were similar; overall, the specificity was 89.1% for cytology vs. 100% for FISH, and no significant difference was observed between the methods. Notably, FISH exhibited 100% sensitivity for cytologically non-diagnostic UC, but 33.3% specificity. In conclusion, FISH is a reliable and non-invasive diagnostic tool for bladder and upper urinary tract UC, particularly in patients with low-grade or early stage tumors.",

In addition, no nomogram for overall survival (OS) was available to date. Methods: The full data of 716 patients were available. The whole cohort was randomly divided into two cohorts: the training cohort for developing the nomograms (n = 508) and the validation cohort for validating the models (n = 208). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used for establishing the prediction models. The discriminative accuracy of nomograms were measured by Harrell\u2019s concordance index (C-index). The clinical usefulness and net benefit of the predictive models were estimated and visualized by using Decision curve analyses (DCA). Results: The median...",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to further validate the prognostic role of fibrinogen in upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) in a large Chinese cohort. A total of 703 patients who underwent radical nephroureterectomy were retrospectively identified. Fibrinogen levels of \u22654.025 g l were defined as elevated. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between fibrinogen and adverse pathological features. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression models were used to assess the associations of fibrinogen with cancer-specific survival (CSS), disease recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS). Harrell c-index and decision curve analysis were used to assess the clinical utility of multivariate models. The median follow-up duration was 42 (range: 1-168) months. Logistic regression analysis revealed that elevated fibrinogen was associated with higher tumor stage and grade, lymph node involvement, lymphovascular invasion, sessile carcinoma, concomitant variant histology, and positive surgical margins (all P < 0.05). Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that elevated fibrinogen was independently associated with decreased CSS (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.33; P < 0.001), RFS (HR: 2.09; P < 0.001), and OS (HR: 2.09; P < 0.001). The predictive accuracies of the multivariate models were improved by 3.2%, 2.0%, and 2.8% for CSS, RFS, and OS, respectively, when fibrinogen was added. Decision curve analysis showed an added benefit for CSS prediction when fibrinogen was added to the model. Preoperative fibrinogen may be a strong independent predictor of worse oncologic outcomes in UTUC; therefore, it may be valuable to apply this marker to the current risk stratification in UTUC.",

However, the mechanism of Doc-resistance development in prostate cancer cells is still unclear. Here, we observed a subpopulation of prostate cancer cells, in both Doc-resistant cell lines and the tumors of patients with HRPC, which show stem cell markers and greater tumorigenic potential. Those stem-like prostate cancer cells show high expression of ABCB1, which encodes multidrug resistance-related protein P-glycoprotein, leading to the Doc-resistance in prostate cancer. Moreover, we found that Notch signaling pathway activation in Doc-resistant cell lines and tumor tissues of patients with HRPC correlated with tumorigenicity and the development of Doc resistance. Here, we revealed that a combination of Doc and a Notch signaling inhibitor overcomes Doc resistance and increases the survival of mice with Doc-resistant xenografts. Therefore, targeting the Notch signaling pathway may be a promising strategy to overcome the Doc-resistant cancer in the clinic.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: About 10 % of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) present with an inguinal hernia. Its cure simultaneously with RP remains a concern with respect to the type of technique, and the risk to infect an eventual mesh The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasability, morbidity and efficacy of combined inguinal hernia synthetic mesh repair during robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). METHODS: 526 medical records of patients who underwent transperitoneal RARP from 2006 to 2015 were reviewed. Demographics and peri-operative datas were analyzed for two groups (RARP alone vs RARP and hernia repair). Pre-operative iv cefazoline and gentamycine was given to all patients. Cure was performed using a polyester mesh (Parietex Covidien, New Haven, USA), placing the porous side against the wall for an efficient tissue integration, and the smooth side facing the structures on which tissular attachment had to be limited. The mesh was cut in a rectangle of approximately 10x8 cm or 18x8 cm for respectively unilateral and bilateral cures, and was anchored with absorbable staples (Absorbatack e Covidien), so as non absorbable sutures around the iliac vessels. Early complications were classified using ClavienDindo classification. Hernia recurrence was assessed during regular follow-up, or self-reported by patients. RESULTS: 49 patients (9 %) had a hernia repair associated with RARP (35 unilateral and 14 bilateral). Median age, BMI and ASA score were the same in both groups. Total operative time was 278 min for RARP vs 290 min for combined procedure. Post-operative length of stay (median 4 days) and blood loss were not affected by the combined procedure. There were no mesh infections nor migrations. Complication rate was identical in both groups. After a median follow-up of 44 months (IQR 17-86), 46 patients (94 %) were hernia-free, while 3 (6 %) presented a hernia recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Combined inguinal hernia repair with a synthetic mesh during RARP is a feasible and efficient procedure which added no morbidity to standard RARP. Placing the mesh during an operation with urine spillage led to no infections. Efficacy after medianterm follow-up is similar to laparoscopic hernia repair alone. Combined hernia repair should therefore be discussed for patients undergoing RARP suffering from inguinal hernia.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:   To compare the efficacy and safety between tadalafil once-a-day and tadalafil on-demand dosing regimen in patients with ED.   Materials and Methods:   A systematic search of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library was performed to identify all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared tadalafil used a once-a-day with an on-demand dosing regimen for erectile dysfunction. A secondary hand-search was performed in relevant journals, references, and the grey literature. Meta-analyses were performed using Review Manager version 5.3.0.   Results:   Six RCTs involving a total of 1,534 patients were included in this review. All studies reported the International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function domain score and the results of the meta-analysis showed no difference between the groups. The overall pooled estimated weighted mean differences (WMD) was 0.97 (95% CI -0.37 to 2.32;  p  = 0.16). Meta-analyses of Sexual Encounter Profile questions 2 and 3 (SEP-2 and SEP-3) showed that the once-a-day dosing regimen was superior to the on-demand regimen with statistical significance. The WMD of SEP-2 and SEP-3 were 10.32 (95% CI 3.16-17.48;  p  = 0.005) and 11.07 (95% CI 2.57-19.56;  p  = 0.01), respectively. Both dosing regimens of tadalafil showed similar complication rates. The meta-analyses of adverse events showed no significant differences.   Conclusions:   The efficacy rates of tadalafil once-a-day and on-demand were similar. No significant difference in safety was found between the 2 dose regimens of tadalafil.",

Methods: This retrospective study collected 387 patients received RP and diagnosed GS 7 (3+4 or 4+3) in the West China Hospital from January 2009 to December 2017.Regardlessly the first Gleason pattern, patients were divide into 2 groups: TGP5 absence and TGP5 presence. Furthermore, we added the primary Gleason pattern to divided patients into 4 groups: GS 3+4, GS 3+4/TGP 5, Gleason 4+3, Gleason 4+3/TGP 5. Cox proportional-hazards models was used to evaluate the association between the status of TGP5 and BCR after adjusting the confounding factors with follow-up time as the underlying time scale. All the analyses were conducted with the use of statistical software packages Rnand EmpowerStats and conducted as two sides and P values less than 0.05 were considered statistical significance.

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tubeless versus standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). Relevant randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials studies were identified from electronic database (Cochrane CENTRAL, Medline and EMBASE et al.). The retrieval time ended in August 2010. The quality of the included trials was assessed and the data were extracted independently by two reviewers. We divided the participants who received standard PCNL into two subgroups: small tube (4-10 F) group and big tube (14-24 F) group to reduce heterogeneity and bias. Efficacy (hospital stay time, operative time, stone-free rate) and safety (postoperative pain and analgesia requirement, postoperative fever, blood transfusion, urine leakage) were explored by using review manager v5.0. Fourteen randomized controlled trials comprising 776 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Our meta-analysis showed that there were statistically significant differences in hospital stay, postoperative analgesic requirement and urine leakage between tubeless and standard PCNL. In operative time, significant difference was found between tubeless and big tube group. No statistically significant differences were found in stone-free rate, postoperative fever, and blood transfusion between tubeless and standard PCNL. In conclusion, Tubeless PCNL was an effective and safe procedure for treatment of renal stones in selected patients, with shorter hospital stay, less analgesic requirement, lower urine leakage and without increased complications. Patients can receive great benefit from tubeless PCNL and it will become more palatable to patients as well as more cost-effective than standard PCNL in the future.",

The total RNA of each sample was extracted. RT-PCR procedure was conducted using primer of MCP-1,TLR-2,TLR-4, NF\u043aB(Premega), and products were analyzed with agarose gels electrophoresis. Results:The expressions of MCP-1,TLR-2,TLR-4 and NF\u043aB were increased in BCG-treated bladder cancer samples, compared with untreated bladder cancer samples and urologic tumor-free samples.Conclusions:The expressions of MCP-1,TLR-2,TLR-4 and NF\u043aB were increased in BCG-treated bladder cancer samples. Expression of MCP-1 may be depended on TLR2 and TLR4 activating NF\u043aB. MCP-1 expression up-regulation was partially involved in antitumor mechanism of BCG.",

We performed a systematic research of Medline, Embase, Cochrane central registration for RCTs concerning the comparison between stented and non-stented post-ureteroscopic procedures for stone removal and reference lists of the included study were also screened. 15 trials were included and data related was extracted and analyzed in meta way. No difference was detected in stone free rate and stricture formation between the two groups (P = 0.69; P = 0.67). Participants with stents had higher risk of being infected than those without, RR = 1.72, but with no difference. Stent related lower urinary symptoms were more frequently experienced by stented patients, dysuria (RR = 5.24, P = 0.003); hematuria (RR = 7.28, P = 0.001); loin voiding pain (RR = 5.24, P = 0.003). Postoperative pain score were also higher in patients with stent in the early period after surgery with mean difference 0.95 (P = 0.002). With additional time needed for the placement of stent, the operative time in stented patients were 3.36 min longer than those without stenting (P = 0.02). The additional cost for longer operative room stay, together with the sent and cystoscopic stent removed conditionally, and made the cost for stented patients much higher. No difference were detected in length of hospital stay between both groups (P = 0.22), the stented patients were even of lower rate pay unplanned hospital visit (RR = 0.81, P = 0.55). Stenting did not improve the outcome of patients who underwent ureteroscopic lithotripsy, but associated with increased complication rate. Routinely stenting after ureteroscopic procedure for stone removal was not necessary; however, it still should be reserved conditionally.",

The clinicopathologic parameters were analyzed to determine their effect on survival.Of the 41 patients, 18 were women and 23 were men. Their median age was 42 years (range 19-76). The median tumor size was 13 cm (range 4-35); 29 cases (70.7%) were high grade. The predominant histologic subtype was leiomyosarcoma (39.0%). At diagnosis, 6 patients (14.6%) had metastatic disease. Surgical resection was performed in 34 patients (82.9%), with negative margins in 22 (53.7%). After a median follow-up of 24 months (range 3-80), 3 patients (8.1%) had survived disease free, 11 (29.7%) were alive with disease, and 23 (62.2%) had died of disease. The overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rate was 86.3%, 40.7%, and 14.5%, respectively, and the median survival was 28 months. The median survival after recurrence was 10 months (range 4-24) and that after metastasis 8 months (range 0-22). On univariate analyses, nonmetastatic disease (P = .001) and surgical resection (P = .000) were predictive of a favorable outcome. On multivariate analyses, surgical resection was the only independent predictor of survival (hazard ratio 35.629, P = .022).Adult renal sarcoma accounts for 0.8% of renal cancer cases and has a poor prognosis. Early diagnosis and surgical resection offer patients the best chance of survival.",

A review of the literature is also considered. A 70-year-old man presenting with diabetes mellitus and hypertension was referred to West China Hospital (Chengdu, China) with constant left flank pain that had been apparent for 2 months. Ultrasonography identified a heterogeneous tumor with a solid component measuring 4.4\u00d73.4\u00d75.0 cm, and computed tomography (CT) revealed a circumscribed and contrast-enhanced tumor in the left kidney. Subsequent pathological analysis of the specimen, obtained from an open radical nephrectomy, confirmed the presence of ccRCC. At 1 month after the radical nephrectomy, an abdominopelvic CT scan identified tumors located on the posterior bladder wall and also in the left retroperitoneal space, forming due to hematuria and acute urinary clot retention. There was no evidence of metastasis to the lungs, bones or other organs. A transurethral resection of the bladder tumor was performed and pathological analysis of the bladder specimen demonstrated metastatic ccRCC. Extensive hydrothorax and general anasarca presented half a month after the transurethral resection, with the patient subsequently succumbing 15 days later.",

        "abstract": "Chemokine and chemokine receptors could have played an important role in tumor angiogenesis and distant metastasis. The mechanism of inflammation, expression and function of chemokines and chemokine receptors in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PCa) remain unclear. The purpose of present study is to detect differential expression and function of chemokines and chemokine receptors (CCRs) in BPH and PCa.BPH-1 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were co-cultured in Transwell chambers, and human normal prostate (NP) tissues, BPH tissues and PCa tissues were collected. CCR gene-chips were used to analyze and compare the differential expression of CCRs in BPH-1 cells, BPH-1 cells co-cultured with PBMCs, and LNCaP cells. The differential expression of CCRs was detected and validated using real-time PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence (IF). The proliferation of LNCaP cells was also investigated after the knockdown CXCR5.RESULTS of gene-chips indicated that there was low or no expression of CCR10, CXCR1, CXCR3 and CXCR5 in BPH-1 cells, whereas the expression of these receptors in BPH-1 cells was increased by PBMCs, and the expression was high in LNCaP cells. Furthermore, real-time PCR and western blotting confirmed the above mentioned results. IF verified no or low expression of CXCR1, CXCR3 and CXCR5 in NP tissues, low or moderate expression in BPH and high expression in PCa. However, CCR10 was not expressed at detectable levels in the three groups. The growth and proliferation of LNCaP cells was markedly inhibited after down-regulation of CXCR5.PCa cells expressed high levels of CCR10, CXCR1, CXCR3 and CXCR5. Although BPH cells did not express these factors, their expression was up-regulated when BPH-1 cells were incubated with inflammatory cells. Finally, down-regulation of CXCR5 inhibited the growth and proliferation of LNCaP cells.",

        "abstract": "This paper was aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of adult male circumcision using the Shang Ring\u2122 (SR) with the no-flip technique compared with Dorsal Slit (DS) surgical method. A single-centered, prospective study was conducted at the West China Hospital, where patients were circumcised using the no-flip SR (n = 408) or the DS (n = 94) procedure. The adverse events (AEs) and satisfaction were recorded for both groups, and ring-removal time and percentage of delayed removals were recorded for the SR group. Finally, complete follow-up data were collected for 76.1% of patients (SR: n = 306; DS: n = 76). The average ring-removal time for the SR group was 17.62 \u00b1 6.30 days. The operation time (P < 0.001), pain scores during the procedure (P < 0.001) and at 24 h postoperatively (P < 0.001), bleeding (P = 0.001), infection (P = 0.034), and satisfaction with penile appearance (P < 0.001) in the SR group were superior to those in the DS group. After two postoperative weeks, the percentage of patients with edema in the SR group (P = 0.029) was higher but no differences were found at 4 weeks (P = 0.185) between the two groups. In conclusions, the no-flip SR method was found to be superior to the DS method for its short operation time (<5 min), involving less pain, bleeding, infection, and resulting in a satisfactory appearance. However, the time for recovery from edema took longer, and patients may wear device for 2-3 weeks after the procedure. ",

Methods Mediated by liposome, pPSMA enhancer/promoter-i/PAT was transferred into prostate cancer line. And the cell line that could express UPRT gene stably was selected with antibiotic G418. The various percentages of prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) transfected and non-transfected were mixed to observe the bystander effect of suicide gene system UPRT/5-FU. Results The cell line that could express UPRT gene stably was screened successfully. With the LNCaP cells that expressed UPRT gene becoming more and more, the cell survival rate went down gradually. No obvious bystander effect showed after using UPRT/5-FU suicide gene system. Conclusion pPSMA enhancer/promoter-i/P.R7V5-FU suicide gene system kills LNCaP cells in target. UPRT can transform 5-FU into toxic metabolites quickly and play the role of cytotoxicity. However, the bystander effect of UPRT75-FU isn't obvious. It will be studied further for UPRT/5-FU how to strengthen the cytotoxic role by improving the bystander effect.",

The stent was routinely placed for 3 weeks. Outcome measures included operative time, visual analog scale, post-operative analgesic requirements, complications, and the stone-free rate.The incidence of hematuria was higher and the operative time was longer in the stented group compared to the non-stented group. At 48 hours post-operatively, the symptoms of flank pain and abdominal pain were significantly greater in the stented group. There was no statistical difference in the 2 groups, in terms of irritative symptom, analgesic use, and complications.

        "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of tamsulosin as an \u03b1(1)-blocker in the treatment of the renal and ureteral stones after shockwave lithotripsy (SWL).Relevant randomized controlled trials were identified by electronic and document searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Chinese Biomedical Disk and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials until April 2010. No language restriction was applied. Trials were included if patients were randomized to receive either tamsulosin or standard therapy with or without placebo after SWL. The main outcome was the stone clearance rate. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Meta-analysis was conducted with Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.0.Fifteen studies involving 1326 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Study duration ranged from 2 weeks to 3 months. The pooled analysis showed a 24% [risk ratio (RR) = 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12 to 1.37] improvement in stone clearance tamsulosin. According to stone locations (renal, upper ureteral and lower ureteral), the pooling effects of tamsulosin were analysed, with a higher expulsion rate obtained than control (RR = 1.38, 1.83, 1.43, and 95% CI 1.17 to 1.61, 1.20 to 2.78, 1.13 to 1.81, respectively). Tamsulosin 0.4 mg had a high possibility of achieving successful outcome (RR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.47). In addition, a shorter expulsion time, lower analgesic requirements, fewer colic episodes and adverse effects were observed.Tamsulosin is a safe and effective therapy for renal and ureteral stones after SWL. Further, high-quality randomized trials are necessary to confirm its efficacy.",

In addition, a completely retroperitoneoscopic resection of mature cystic teratomas has been reported only in two cases.We report a case of a large mature cystic teratoma with a regular margin in the right adrenal gland. Three months before surgery, abdominal enhanced computer tomography revealed a 5.7\u2009\u00d7\u20094.9\u2009\u00d7\u20094.3 cm lipoid tumour of mixed density with calcification in the tumorous centre, clinically diagnosed as adrenal myelolipoma or adenoma.

The pathological report suggested the final diagnosis of mature cystic teratoma. The patient had an uneventful course after the surgery and was free of recurrence or metastasis within 8 months of follow-up.Retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy for large adrenal masses is safe and feasible.

        "abstract": "Extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) is a rare malignant tumor that is characterized by a malignant plasma cell neoplasm. Such neoplasms in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients are extremely rare. To the best of our knowledge, the present study describes the first case of a solitary adrenal EMP in a patient with HIV. A 35-year-old male who had been diagnosed with HIV 3 months previously presented with a 2-week history of intermittent right flank pain. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a soft-tissue density mass in the right adrenal gland area. The patient subsequently underwent a retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Post-operative pathological diagnosis revealed a solitary EMP. Although the patient refused to undergo post-operative radiotherapy and chemotherapy, no recurrence was detected after 2 years of follow-up. The present case illustrates the fact that this rare type of solitary EMP associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) can occur in the adrenal glands, and that retroperitoneal laparoscopic resection of the tumor may be a good method to manage this condition. In addition, although rare, solitary EMP should be considered in the differential diagnosis of an adrenal mass in HIV-infected patients.",

The outcomes included symptoms, fever, positive urine culture, urinary tract infection and risk factors. The Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager software (RevMan 5.1.4) was used for statistical analysis.The study inclusion criteria were met by 9 trials (3 placebo controlled and 6 no treatment controlled) involving 1,364 patients. The synthesized data from these randomized controlled trials indicated that there were no significant differences between the prophylactic group and the control group in symptoms, rate of fever (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.07-2.36, p = 0.31), rate of positive urine culture (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.54-1.11, p = 0.17) and incidence of urinary tract infection (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.29-1.01, p = 0.05). Antibiotic prophylaxis had no potentially beneficial effect on the prevention of infection in patients with a temporary ureteral catheter related to shock wave lithotripsy.Prophylactic antibiotics could not improve symptoms, and decreased neither the rate of fever and positive urine culture, nor the incidence of urinary tract infection after shock wave lithotripsy. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not necessary for shock wave lithotripsy, especially when no or low risk factors are presented.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the incidence and risk factors for peripartum hysterectomy (PH) in Sichuan, China.A population-based study was conducted using the obstetric inpatient records of women who gave birth at 1 of 8 hospitals between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2010. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for PH.During the study period, 64 cases of PH occurred among 34014 deliveries (0.2%); abnormal placentation and uterine atony were the major indications for surgery. Several factors significantly increased the risk of PH among the study population: placenta previa (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 10.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.7-17.7), uterine atony (AOR 7.4; 95% CI, 4.3-12.8), repeat cesarean delivery (AOR 3.0; 95% CI, 1.2-7.7), low birth weight (AOR 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5-4.6), and multiparity (AOR 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.4). By contrast, multiple gestation, primary cesarean delivery, placental abruption, leiomyoma, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, and diabetes mellitus did not significantly increase the risk of PH.Placenta previa, uterine atony, repeat cesarean delivery, low birth weight, and multiparity were risk factors for PH among the study population.",

Articles were searched by 2 independent reviewers. Overall, 8 randomized controlled trials involving 3314 patients were included. Compared with the CC group, SRC is associated with shorter operative time, lower intraoperative pain score, higher satisfaction with penile appearances, less intraoperative blood loss, lower adverse event rate, and lower wound bleeding rate. SRC appears to be a safer and more effective choice in comparison with CC for male patients.",

        "abstract": "The majority of clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) are caused by an accumulation of hypoxia\u2011inducible factor (HIF) and the overexpression of downstream genes in response to the von Hippel\u2011Lindau (VHL) gene becoming inactivated. In the present study, our hypothesis was that BNIP3, a gene positioned downstream of HIF, would be expressed at a higher level in ccRCC; however, instead, lower levels of BNIP3 expression were identified in RCC tumor tissues compared with adjacent non\u2011tumor tissues. These changes were associated with lower levels of VHL, and higher levels of HIF and vascular endothelial growth factor. BNIP3 was also undetectable in three investigated RCC cell lines (786\u2011O, ACHN, A498) and GRC\u20111\u20111 cells. Methylation of the BNIP3 promoter was not detected, and neither did treatment with a methylation inhibitor cause cell proliferation. However, treatment with a histone deacetylation inhibitor, trichostatin\u00a0A (TSA), inhibited cultured RCC cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis and restored BNIP3 expression. Furthermore, histone deacetylation of the BNIP3 promoter was identified in ACHN and 786\u2011O cells, and the acetylation status was restored following TSA treatment. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that histone deacetylation, but not methylation, is most likely to cause BNIP3 inactivation in RCC. The data also indicated that restoration of BNIP3 expression by a histone deacetylation inhibitor led to growth inhibition and apoptotic promotion in RCC.",

        "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common diagnosed cancer and the fifth cause of cancer-related mortality for males worldwide. At present, there is no effective treatment for PCa. Towards further understanding molecular mechanism and developing therapeutics for PCa, we investigated the role of miR34a in PCa progression. Previous studies have reported that miR-34a was significantly downregulated in PCa cells; therefore, modulation of miR34a expression might be a promising therapeutic approach for PCa treatment. To this end, we first verified the downregulation of miR34a in prostate tumor from transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. We found that overexpression of miR-34a could significantly inhibit the cell cycle of PC3 cells (a human PCa cell line) by prolonging G1 and shortening S phases through targeting cyclin D1 (CCND1). To investigate if in vivo gene delivery of pri-miR34a to the prostates of TRAMP mice can inhibit PCa progression, we opted to screen 12 serotypes of rAAVs, an efficient and safe in vivo gene delivery platform with serotype dependent tissue tropisms for efficient prostate in vivo and PCa cell in vitro transduction. Among several leading candidate vectors (i.e. AAV6.2, AAV7 and AAV9) identified, we first tested the concept of intraprostatic injection of rAAV9 pri -miR34a (4\u00d71011 GCs/prostate) to 8-week old TRAMP mice for inhibition of PCa progression. We observed that the treatment lowered body weights significantly (p u003c 0.05) as compared to the control group starting from 24 weeks after injection, likely resulted from the higher tumor burden in the control group. rAAV9.pri -miR34a treatment also significantly extended the lifespan of TRAMP mice (p u003c 0.05). Moreover, we confirmed that the proliferation and neoplasia in the treated prostates were significantly diminished when compared to those in the control group. Currently, the experiments are under the way to elucidate the molecular mechanism of overexpressed miR34a to slow down PCa progression. Taken together, our results demonstrated, for the first time, the potentials of rAAV-mediated efficient modulation of miRNA expression in the prostate for inhibiting PCa progression and studying molecular mechanisms in PCa development.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Serenoa repens among patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia [LUTS/BPH]) in China. Methods: We conducted a double blind, placebo-controlled study of 354 patients with LUTS/BPH from 19 institutions, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Serenoa repens. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) into the Serenoa repens extract (320 mg) or placebo groups for 24 weeks. Primary efficacy parameters were changes in International Prostate Symptom Score and peak urinary flow from baseline to each assessment. Secondary efficacy parameters included improvement of storage symptom and voiding symptom scores, prostate volume, urinary frequency, and total prostate-specific antigen level. Other parameters assessed were quality of life score, a four\u2010item male sexual function questionnaire score, and International Index of Erectile Function score across the consecutive double-blind visits. Results: Statistically significant improvement in the peak urinary flow, International Prostate Symptom Score, scores of storage symptoms and voiding symptoms, quality of life score, four\u2010item male sexual function questionnaire score, and International Index of Erectile Function score were observed in the Serenoa repens extract group compared with those in the placebo group (P <.05). Two (1.18%) of 169 patients in the placebo group and 3 (1.89) of 159 patients in the Serenoa repens extract group experienced 1 or more adverse events. Conclusion: The Serenoa repens extract was effective, safe, well-tolerated, and clinically and statistically superior to placebo in the target LUTS/BPH population. \u00a9 2019",

        "abstract": "Cadherin mimetic peptides are widely used in synthetic biomaterials to mimic cell-cell adhesion in cell microniches. This mimicry regulates various cell behaviors. Although the interaction between immobilized cadherin and cells is investigated in numerous studies, the exact manner of functioning of cadherin mimetic peptides is yet to be fully understood. Cadherin mimetic peptides mimic only the critical amino acid sequence of cadherin and are not equal to these proteins in function. Compared to the cadherin proteins, mimetic peptides are more stable, easier to fabricate, and exhibit a precise chemical composition. In this study the E-cadherin mimetic peptide His-Ala-Val (HAV) on material surfaces is immobilized and epithelial cell adhesion and clustering are studied. The results suggest that immobilized HAV peptides specifically interact with E-cadherin on the cell membrane, resulting in an increased expression of E-cadherin and its downstream signaling protein \u03b2-catenin. This interaction relocates E-cadherin-based adhesion from the cell-cell interface to the cell-materials interface, which promotes cell adhesion via mechanosensing and initiates a transition in the cell cluster from a solid-like to a fluid-like state. The study presents an overview of the interactions between E-cadherin mimetic peptide and epithelial cells to aid in the design of novel biomaterials.",

        "abstract": "This study compared the diagnostic efficacy of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy (TRBx) and transperineal prostate biopsy (TPBx) in patients with suspected prostate cancer (PCa). We enrolled 2962 men who underwent transrectal (n = 1216) or transperineal (n = 1746) systematic 12-core prostate biopsy. Clinical data including age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and prostate volume (PV) were recorded. To minimize confounding, we performed propensity score-matching analysis. We measured and compared PCa detection rates between TRBx and TPBx, which were stratified by clinical characteristics and Gleason scores. The effects of clinical characteristics on PCa detection rate were assessed by logistic regression. For all patients, TPBx detected a higher proportion of clinically significant PCa (P < 0.001). Logistic regression analyses illustrated that PV had a smaller impact on PCa detection rate of TPBx compared with TRBx. Propensity score-matching analysis showed that the detection rates in TRBx were higher than those in TPBx for patients aged >- 80 years (80.4% vs 56.5%, P = 0.004) and with PSA level 20.1-100.0 ng ml (80.8% vs 69.1%, P = 0.040). In conclusion, TPBx was associated with a higher detection rate of clinically significant PCa than TRBx was; however, because of the high detection rate at certain ages and PSA levels, biopsy approaches should be optimized according to patents' clinical characteristics.",

        "abstract": "Chronic cystitis is characterized by the hyperplasia and fibrosis of the bladder wall as well as attenuated compliance of the bladder. To further unravel its underlying molecular mechanism, the role of NF\u03baB-JMJD3 signaling pathway in cystitis induced bladder fibrosis was investigated. Jmjd3 and Col1/3 expression was detected in a cystitis mouse model that was developed by intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide (CYP). Human bladder smooth muscle cells (hBSMCs) were stimulated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the cell proliferation and collagen accumulation were detected using EdU, CCK8, flow cytometry, qPCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence assays. Furthermore, the effects of NF\u03baB and JMJD3 on cell proliferation and collagen accumulation were investigated using its selective antagonists, JSH23 and GSK-J4, respectively. CYP induced cystitis significantly increased Jmjd3, Col1 and Col3 expression in the bladder muscle cells. Furthermore, LPS stimulation markedly activated NF\u03baB signaling and elevated JMJD3 expression in hBSMCs, and the activation of NF\u03baB-JMJD3 signaling significantly promoted cell proliferation and collagen accumulation by upregulating CCND1 and COL1/3 expression, respectively. Our study reveals the critical role of NF\u03baB-JMJD3 signaling in cystitis induced bladder reconstruction by regulating hBSMC proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, and these findings provide an avenue for effective treatment of patients with cystitis.",

        "abstract": "Erectile dysfunction and penile shrinkage are the common complications after radical prostatectomy. Penile rehabilitation is widely applied after the surgery. Vacuum therapy is one of the three penile rehabilitation methods used in the clinical setting, but its mechanism is not well known. This study was designed to investigate whether vacuum erectile device (VED) can prevent corporeal veno-occlusive dysfunction and penile shrinkage in the bilateral cavernous nerve crush (BCNC) rat model. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into three groups: sham group, BCNC group, and BCNC + VED group. After 4 weeks, penile length and intracavernosal pressure (ICP) were measured, and then the middle part of the penis was harvested after dynamic infusion cavernosometry to complete the following items: smooth muscle/collagen ratios and collagen I/III ratios; ultramicrostructure of the tunica albuginea, endothelial cell, and smooth muscle cell; and the expression of calponin-1 and osteopontin. The penile shortening, peak ICP and ICP drop rate after alprostadil injection were significantly improved with vacuum therapy after 4-week treatment. Compared with BCNC group, VED significantly increased smooth muscle/collagen ratios, decreased collagen I/III ratios, and preserved the ultramicrostructure of the tunica albuginea, endothelial cell, and smooth muscle cell. The data also showed that animals exposed to VED could partially reverse the expression of calponin-1 and osteopontin induced by BCNC. In conclusion, vacuum therapy is effective to prevent penile shrinkage and veno-occlusive dysfunction in penile rehabilitation, which may be associated with well-preserved structure and function of the tunica albuginea, endothelial cell, and smooth muscle cell.",

To interfere with this newly discovered FABP5-related signalling pathway, we have produced a highly efficient recombinant FABP5 inhibitor, named dmrFABP5. Treatment with dmrFABP5 significantly supressed the proliferation, migration, invasion and colony formation of the highly malignant prostate cancer cells PC3-M . To test dmrFABP5's suppressive effect in CRPC, the human PC3-M cells were implanted orthotopically into the prostate gland of immunosuppressed mice to produce tumours. These mice were then treated with dmrFABP5 and produced a highly significant reduction of 100% in metastatic rate and a highly significant reduction of 13-fold in the average size of primary tumours. Immunocytochemial staining showed that the staining intensity of dmrFABP5 treated tumours was reduced by 67%. When tested , dmrFABP5 suppressed the cancer cells by blocking fatty acid stimulation of PPAR\u03b3, and thereby prevented it activating down-stream cancer-promoting or inhibiting cancer-suppressing genes. Our results show that the FABP5 inhibitor dmrFABP5 is a novel molecule for treatment of experimental CRPC and its inhibitory effect is much greater than that produced by SB-FI-26 reported in our previous work.",

        "abstract": "Urethral stricture (US) is a urologic disorder with a high morbidity and recurrence rate, and may arise due to external trauma, surgical procedures or urethritis. The pathogenesis of US is closely associated with scar formation, including excessive collagen-rich connective tissues. Previous studies have shown that connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) plays a key role in the fibrosis process of many tissues and organs, such as kidney and lung. We investigated the variation of CTGF expression in urethral tissues from 12 patients with US and normal urethral tissues. The stricture length range was 1 to 2.5 cm, and 4 patients underwent repeated urethral dilatation. The normal urethral tissues were obtained from 6 patients with heart disease, who were suffering from brain death. The expression of CTGF mRNA and protein was analyzed by real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting analyses. Results showed that the expression level of CTGF mRNA was significantly increased in US patients compared with the control. In addition, US patients who have longer history and more repeated surgical procedures have extremely high CTGF mRNA levels and its protein expression, while the age of patients, position of injury and stricture length were not found obvious relation with CTGF expression. Moreover, the degree of collagen deposition and muscle fiber proliferation in the submucosa is consistent with the increase in CTGF expression. In conclusion, our data suggest that the up-regulation of CTGF expression may be responsible for the fibrosis process of urethral tissues in US patients.",

Previous studies implied that JKTBP1 may be associated with the progression of androgen-independent (AI) prostate cancer. In this study, we generated three stable LNCaP cell lines which expressed exogenous JKTBP1. Furthermore, the effect of ectopic JKTBP1 on the proliferation of LNCaP cells and its mechanism was investigated. We originally found that the ectopic JKTBP1 expression resulted in the proliferation of LNCaP cells in an AI way, as well as inducing the upregulated expression of EGF-R and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), but did not influence the expression level of AR. Moreover, AG1478 suppressed the effect of proliferation induced by JKTBP1. In addition, immunohistochemistry showed that JKTBP1 expression was significantly elevated in AI prostate cancer tissues when compared with the androgen-dependent (AD) prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Our data indicated that overexpression of JKTBP1 in LNCaP cells leads to abnormal cell proliferation and may be involved in the process of AD to AI through induction of EGF-R expression.",

Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-activation plays a critical role in prostate cancer by NF-kappaB inhibitor kinase beta pathway-mediated inflammatory-induced tumorigenesis. A functional insertion/deletion polymorphism (-94 insertion/deletion ATTG) in the promoter of the NFKB1 gene, which encodes the p50 subunit of NF-kappaB, was identified recently. A total of 117 prostate cancer patients and 143 control subjects were recruited in this study. The NFKB1 -94 insertion/deletion ATTG genotype was determined using polymerase chain reaction-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The frequency of the ATTG(2) allele in prostate cancer patients was significantly higher than that in the controls (63.7 vs. 54.5%; P=0.035, OR=1.461). Prostate cancer patients with a history of prostatitis have a 2.275 times higher risk for prostate cancer, compared to the control group (P=0.001). The functional NFKB1 promoter polymorphism is associated with increased risk of prostate cancer.",

        "abstract": "To explore the specific killing effect on prostate cancer cells of a dual cytosine deaminase (CD) and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) expression plasmid system controlled by the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) promoter and enhancer.The CD gene was used to construct the recombinant plasmid prostate-specific membrane antigen(promoter/enhancer)-CD (pPSMA(E/P)-CD). The specific regulatory function of the pPSMA(E/P) promoter was demonstrated by detection of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression in the LNCaP cell line. Survival of cells transfected with different plasmids and treated with 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) was measured by microculture tetrazolium assay. Cell cycle changes were measured by flow cytometry.Target-specific expression of PSMA(E/P) was observed in the prostate cancer cell line. Cytotoxicity of 5-FC was greater against LNCaP cells transfected with pPSMA(E/P)-CD and UPRT and pPSMA(E/P)-CD than control groups. Percentages of cells in S phase were 37.5% (LNCaP) and 30.6% (5-FC treatment) in the un-transfected groups, whereas they were 23.9% and 12.4% in the double and single suicide gene groups, respectively.Our findings confirm the cytotoxic efficacy of the pPSMA(E/P)-CD + 5-FC and pPSMA(E/P)-CD and UPRT + 5-FC suicide gene systems. The CD and UPRT gene system quickly and directly converted 5-FC into 5-FU, and then into toxic metabolites. The CD and UPRT double suicide gene system was more effective in inducing tumor cell apoptosis with 5-FC than the single suicide gene system. Thus, this construct can specifically target prostate cancer cells and might have a role in gene therapy against prostate cancer.",

In the present study, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of thulium laser resection of the prostate (TMLRP) with either transurethral plasmakinetic resection of the prostate (TUPKP) or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). A literature search was performed, eventually, 14 studies involving 1587 patients were included. Forest plots were produced by using Revman 5.2.0 software. Our meta-analysis showed that operation time, decrease in hemoglobin level, length of hospital stay, catheterization time, and development of urethral stricture significantly differed, whereas the transitory urge incontinence rate, urinary tract infection rate, and recatheterization rate did not significantly differ between TMLRP and either TURP or TUPKP. The blood transfusion rate was significantly different between TMLRP and TURP, but not between TMLRP and TUPKP. In addition, the retrograde ejaculation rate between TMLRP and TURP did not significantly differ. At 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of postoperative follow-up, the maximum flow rate, post-void residual, quality of life, and International Prostate Symptom Score did not significantly differ among the procedures. Thus, the findings of this study indicate that TMLRP may be a safe and feasible alternative.",

PSMA promoter and enhancer DNA sequences were amplified from the LNCaP human prostate cancer cell line by polymerase chain reaction, then recombinant plasmids of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP: pEGFP-PSMA(Pro), pEGFP-PSMA(E-P), pEGFP-PSMA(E(r)-P), pEGFP-PSMA(E(d)-P), and pEGFP-PSMA(E(t)-P)) were constructed with molecular clonal techniques. At the same time, all experimental cell lines were analyzed for the expression of PSMA with the use of PSMA monoclonal antibody and the ABC immunohistochemical assay kit. After plasmids were transfected via liposome, we observed the expression of the reporter gene (EGFP) under a fluorescent microscope and compared the different levels of EGFP expression with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry so that we could choose the one with the highest transcriptional activity. Only the LNCaP cell line expressed PSMA positively with immunohistochemical stain. The PSMA promoter/enhancer had transcriptional activity in PSMA(+) cell lines and no activity in PSMA(-) cell lines. PSMA(E-P) achieved the strongest activity in different PSMA promoter/enhancer combinations. We confirmed the specific expression of PSMA in prostate cells again. Similarly, transcriptional activity of the PSMA promoter/enhancer was prostate specific. PSMA(E-P) achieved the strongest transcriptional activity among PSMA promoter/enhancer combinations, which could be used in advanced research for tissue-specific treatment.",

        "abstract": "Generally, hypoxia is a normal physiological condition in the flaccid penis, which is interrupted by regular nocturnal erections in men with normal erectile function.  [1]  Lack of spontaneous and nocturnal erections after radical prostatectomy due to neuropraxia results in persistent hypoxia of cavernosal tissue, which leads to apoptosis and degeneration of cavernosal smooth muscle fibers. Therefore, overcoming hypoxia is believed to play a crucial role during neuropraxia. The use of a vacuum erectile device (VED) in penile rehabilitation is reportedly effective and may prevent loss of penile length. The corporal blood after VED use is increased and consists of both arterial and venous blood, as revealed by color Doppler sonography and blood gas analysis. A similar phenomenon was observed in negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT). However, NPWT employs a lower negative pressure than VED, and a hypoperfused zone, which increases in response to negative pressure adjacent to the wound edge, was observed. Nonetheless, questions regarding ideal subatmospheric pressure levels, modes of action, and therapeutic duration of VED remain unanswered. Moreover, it remains unclear whether a hypoperfused zone or PO  2  gradient appears in the penis during VED therapy. To optimize a clinical VED protocol in penile rehabilitation, further research on the mechanism of VED, especially real-time PO  2  measurements in different parts of the penis, should be performed.",

Lysyl oxidase-like proteins (LOXL), LOX isozymes with partial structural homology, exhibit similar catalytic activities. This review summarizes recent findings describing the roles of LOX family members in urological cancers and fibrosis. LOX/LOXL play key roles in extracellular matrix stability and integrity, which is essential for normal female pelvic floor function. LOX/LOXL inhibition may reverse kidney fibrosis and ischemic priapism. LOX and LOXL2 reportedly promote kidney carcinoma tumorigenesis, while LOX, LOXL1 and LOXL4 suppress bladder cancer growth. Multiple studies agree that the LOX propeptide may suppress tumor growth, but the role of LOX in prostate cancer remains controversial. Further studies are needed to clarify the exact effects and mechanism of LOX/LOXL on urological malignancies.",

This study investigated the real-world treatment patterns of docetaxel as chemotherapy in patients with advanced PC in China. Methods: This was a multi-center, prospective, observational, non-interventional, product registry study. All patients with advanced PC who failed with previous endocrine therapies, were receiving docetaxel containing chemotherapy, and consented to participate in the study were eligible to be enrolled. Patients were followed-up 2 years, for the collection and analysis of data on docetaxel treatment mode, prostate specific antigen (PSA) remission rate, survival time, etc. Results: A total of 407 patients were enrolled from Aug 2011 through Jun 2014, with a mean Gleason score of 8.0 (SD: 1.11), and median PSA of 61.0 (range: 0.0 to 5000.0) ng/ml. 302 (74.2%) patients were classified as clinical stage IV.

        "abstract": "The flowers of Zingiberaceae have higher degrees of organ fusion and specialization with one functional stamen and two lateral subsidiary structures,which result in controversial explanations on the derivation and nature of the floral organs.However,the origin and course of the floral vasculature may provide credible evidence to understand the nature of floral structures.This paper reported the floral anatomy of Hedychium forrestii Diels with paraffin method.The floral vasculature of H.forrestii is described and the nature of labellum and petaloid subsidiary structures is discussed.The labellum is supposed to represent one member of the outer androecial whorl by the median bundle and two members of the inner whorl by its two lateral traces.While the two petaloid structures,the petaloid staminodes,receive vascular traces of two adaxial sets of carpellary dorsals,representing two inner androecial members.Present evidence is in support of the Thompson and Gregory's view that the labellum is a triple structure in Zingiberaceae.As in other species of Zingiberaceae,the epigynous glands on the prolongation of the flower in H.forrestii are vascularized emergences of the ovary,which are of modified gynoplural nectary but not androecial member.Comparison with other species studied,the origin and course of floral vasculature are consistent in the tribe Hedychium,which indicated that homeosis played an important role in the evolution of the flower in Zingiberaceae.",

        "abstract": "Little is known about the comparative susceptibility and differential pathogenic characteristics of Chinese-origin rhesus macaques upon infection with the chimeric SHIVs most commonly applied in experimental research.In vivo infectivity, viral replication, and disease progression related to SHIV-1157ipd3N4, SHIV-162P3, and SHIV-KB9 infections were assessed after intravenous inoculation of Chinese-origin rhesus macaques (n = 10 each).SHIV-KB9-infected monkeys had higher plasma viral loads than those infected with SHIV-1157ipd3N4 or SHIV-162P3 (P < 0.05). The SHIV-KB9 group had a member that progressed rapidly to simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and was moribund at 155 days post-inoculation. SHIV-KB9 and SHIV-162P3 showed reverse trends in the effects on levels of memory T-cell subpopulations.This study provides foundational data for future efficacy testing of candidate vaccine and antiviral therapy using a Chinese-origin rhesus macaque system.",

        "abstract": "Objective Nonhuman primate models are increasingly used in the screening of candidate AIDS vaccines and immunization strategies for advancement to large-scale human trials.The predictive value of such macaque studies is largely dependent upon the fidelity of the model system in mimicking human immunodeficiency virustype 1(HIV-1) infection in terms of viral transmission,replication,and pathogenesis.The aim of this study was to establish a Chinese-origin rhesus monkey model of CCR5-specific chimeric simian/human immunodeficiency virus(SHIVSF162p3) infection,induced by repeated low-dose intravaginal infection,and explore whether this new chimeric model could be more efficient in AIDS vaccine research.Methods Totally 6 female Chinese-origin rhesus monkeys were enrolled in this study.All animals were intra-vaginally challenged 13 times with 1 mL of a phosphate buffered virus solution containing the heterologous SHIVSF162p3,with 20 TCID50 for the first 7 challenges and 30 TCID50 for the remaining 6 challenges.Challenges were done every 4-7 days.Whole blood was collected and plasma virus was quantified by real-time SYBR green RT-PCR and T cell subsets were determined by flow cytometry analysis.Results Systemtic infection was successfully established in 6 Chinese-origin rhesus macaques after 13 challenges.The peak of viral loads was between 106 copies/mL to 108 copies/mL,wherease their CD4 +/CD8 + ratio was decreased.Conclusions The results of this study provide a firm basis for establishing a Chinese rhesus macaques model of SHIV infection by repeated low dose of SHIVSF162p3,a route more close to natural way of AIDS infection.This model would be very useful for HIV-1 subtype B vaccine and pathogenesis studies.",

        "abstract": "A possible mechanism of susceptibility to superinfection with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-1157ipd3N4 was explored in twelve SHIVSF162P3-infected Chinese rhesus macaques. Based on the kinetics of viral replication for the second infecting virus following SHIV-1157ipd3N4 inoculation, the monkeys were divided into two groups: those relatively resistant to superinfection (SIR) and those relatively sensitive to superinfection (SIS). We found that superinfection-resistant macaques had high primary viremia, whereas superinfection-sensitive macaques had low primary viremia, suggesting that primary SHIVSF162P3 infection with a high viral-replication level would repress superinfection with a heterologous SHIV-1157ipd3N4. Although no correlation of protection against superinfection with virus-specific CD4(+) T cell or CD8(+) T cell immune responses from gut was observed prior to superinfection, superinfection susceptibility was strongly correlated with CD4(+) Tcm cells from gut both prior to the second infecting virus inoculation and on day 7 after superinfection, but not with CD4(+) Tem cells from gut or with CD4(+) Tcm cells from peripheral blood and lymph node. These results point to the important roles of gut-derived CD4(+) Tcm cells for the study of the mechanisms of protection against superinfection and the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of vaccines and therapies against acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).",

        "abstract": "Objective To study the expression of death receptor(CD95) on the surface of peripheral blood CD4+T cells and the CD4+ T cell numbers during the acute phase in SIVmac239 virus-infected rhesus monkeys challenged by rectal(rectal infection: IR) and intravenous(intravenous infection: IV) routes,respectively.Methods Fourteen rhesus monkeys were challenged with SIVmac239 intrarectally or intravenously.Infection was determined by monitoring the viral load,CD4+T lymphocyte number and CD4+/CD8 + ratio.Flow cytometry analysis was used to assess the CD95 expression on the surface of CD4+ T cells at nine time points during the acute-phase infection.Results In the intravenous infection group,CD95 expression on the CD4+T cells began to increase on the next day after infection,and reached the peak value on the 7th day,meanwhile the CD4+T lymphocyte number was declined to the lowest point.In the rectal infection group it also began to rise on the following day after infection and the CD95 expression reached the peak value at 10 days after infection,but the number of CD4+T cells was reduced to the lowest point until the 17th day.Compared with the intravenous infection,the peak value of CD95 expression and the lowest point of CD4+T cell number appeared later in the IR group,and the peak value of CD95 expression occurred a week earlier to the lowest point of CD4+T cells.Conclusions CD95 expression of the CD4+T cells is increased and the amount of CD4+T cells is decreased in SIVmac 239-infected rhesus monkeys challenged intrarectally or intravenously.Our results show that CD95 expressed on the surface of CD4+T cells vary in the SIVmac 239-infected rhesus monkeys.It may be due to the different effects of CD95 during the acute phase infection induced by different routes.",

        "abstract": "Engineered targeting fusion protein XE-TNF\u03b1m2 was prepared.In which,XE is the second excellular domain of CXCR4,a co-receptor of HIV/SIV.TNF\u03b1m2 is a mutation protein of TNF\u03b1.Its side effect was reduced 18 fold.It has been used in clinic for cancer therapy.Jurkat H2/9855,a standard cell line was donated toward by AIDS Reagent Program,NIH,USA.In which,a deleted HIV mutant was inserted into chromosome of Jurkat cells to be 5\u2032LTR-Tat-GFP-3\u2032LTR.XE-TNF\u03b1m2 with different doses were added into 1\u00d7105/ml Jurkat H2/9855 cell suspensions respectively.After 24h,48h and 72h,the GFP in samples were determined by flow cytometry.The results showed that the increase of GFP expression level is along with the extended time of treatment with XE-TNF\u03b1m2,and it is depended on the dosage of XE-TNF\u03b1m2.This result indicated that XE-TNF\u03b1m2 is able to stimulate latent HIV to re-propagate in Jurkat H2/9855 cells.Thus,the host cell were became to be novel infected cells.On the other aspect,the previous study indicated that one of XE-TNF\u03b1m2 functions is to kill the cells infected by HIV/SIV.Accordingly,when the novel re-propagating HIVs start to pullulate,their gp120 must be appeared on the surface of host cells.Then,gp120 must be bound by XE in XE-TNF\u03b1m2,and latter's killing signal must be transduced into cells.In that case,these host cells must be killed by XE-TNF\u03b1m2.Thus,the death of host cells leads to stop the propagation of un-maturated HIVs.Then,such kind of HIV without infection ability must be eliminated together with died host cells before that the re-propagated HIVs maturated to break host cells and to release out from cells.",

Method 10 Rhesus macaques were inoculated with SIVmac251. Rhe viral load in plasma was measured at intervals of 3-5 days in the first month and the inguinal lymph nodes were collected at day 14 post-infection (p.i.). Two macaques whose viral load in plasma was kept at a very low level or undetectable at 18 months post-infection, were sacrificed and tissue samples were collected. The presence of SIV was determined and quantified by in suit hybridization and real-time quantitative PCR. Results The virus load got peaks at about 14 days (the highest 10~7copies/mL in plasma and 10~5-10~8copies/g in inguinal lymph nodes) and cells expressing SIV RNA were detected in inguinal lymph nodes. At 18 months p.i., a very low viral load was detected in the blood, but SIV was demonstrated to be positively distributed and even had a high level in the mesenteric lymph node, suprarenal gland, gyrus hippocampus, jejunum and spleen. Conclusion These results indicate that SIV may be distributed in some other tissues when the plasma viral load is nearly negative. These findings are very meaningful in SIV/SHIV/SAIDS macaques involved in drug screening and evaluation of vaccines for HIV/AIDS.",

Methods Immunofluorescence assay was used to test the sera of 197 mice selected from the samples submitted to our monitoring center during 2011- 2012. Among the 197 samples,130 sera were from some breeding facilities,and 67 sera were from some user facilities. A poly virus specific primer pair was used in PCR to detect poly virus from intestinal contents of 80 mice from breeding facilities. Results The 130 sera from breeding facilities were negative for polyoma virus. There were 7 /67 poly virus-positive samples from the user facilities. A 272 bp polyoma virusspecific amplification products can be detected in experimentally infected mice. No specific amplification products were detected in the 80 samples from breeding facilities. Conclusions Poly virus contaminations are not detected by the current serological and PCR assays in the breeding facilities during the past 2 years. The prevalence of mouse polyoma virus in user facilities should not be neglected. An annual surveillance including poly virus is necessary not only in breeding facilities,but also in user facilities.",

The monkeys were monitored for viral load, CD4, CD8, SHIV-specific antibody and virus genetic variation. The results were compared with those previously observed in Ind Rh macaques.As compared to that observed in Ind Rh macaques, SHIV-KB9 in Ch Rh macaques displayed three identical disease progression patterns. However, the primary pattern was not identical between the two subspecies. The level of plasma viremia differed in SHIV-KB9-infected Ch Rh macaques which exhibited different outcomes from those in Ind Rh macaques. Generally, the values of viral load and the maintenance of CD4+ T cells were associated with humoral responses. Otherwise, the viral genetic distances (divergence, diversity) were larger in animals (M419, M425) with their CD4+ T cells profoundly depleted.The model of SHIV-KB9/Ch Rh macaques displays a relatively slow progression to AIDS compared with Ind Rh macaques, which may more accurately reflect the potential of candidate vaccines in humans.",

Recently,it is reported that MHC genes and haplotypes associated with disease progression have also been identified in SIV-infected rhesus monkeys. Mamu-A*01 is significantly associated with lower set-point viral load and prolonged survival time in rhesus macaques of Indian origin. The polymorphic MHC genes play a crucial role during the initiation and regulation of an immune response,especially cellular immunity,therefore,they are believed to affect the sensitivity of SIV/SHIV to rhesus monkey infection.

        "abstract": "To study the antigenicity of SARS associated coronavirus (CoV) spike S1 (12-672Aa) domain.BALB/c mice were immunized with a plasmid bearing codon-optimized SARS-CoV (Tor2 strain) S1 domain and then boosted with purified S1 protein; the SARS-CoV specific IgG antibody was tested by ELISA and neutralization antibody was determined by in vitro microneutralization assay.S1 domain of SARS-CoV spike, which has been demonstrated harboring the receptor binding domain, successfully elicited SARS-CoV specific IgG antibody in mouse after combined immunization with DNA and purified S1 protein; the antibody elicited solely by S1 could potently neutralize SARS-CoV (HKU-39849) in vitro, 50% of 1 000 TCID50 SARS-CoV challenged cells were protected from viral infection by a 1:1499.68 dilution of mice sera immunized with S1 protein, but negative control sera showed no protection.S1 domain of SARS-CoV spike protein, which is responsible for receptor binding, can efficiently and sufficiently induce highly potent neutralizing antibody in mice. This result suggested that S1 domain could be an effective subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV.",

Methods 4 H5N1 antibody-negative rhesus monkeys and 4 cynomolgus monkeys were inoculated nasally by 107TCID50 H5N1 virus. In some time-points,blood routine analysis and subtype analysis of T lymphocytes were performed. Results Compared with data pre-inoculation,WBC count decreased in the 6th day post-inoculation (PI),and then increased in the 9th day PI. RBC count declined during the first 3 days PI and went back then. The count and ration of lymphocytes increased and reached the peak in the 6th and 9th days PI,respectively. Moreover,CD4+T cell count increased 80% in the 9th day PI compared with pre-inoculation,but the ration of CD4+/CD8+ T cell declined due to the more stable and remarkable elevation of CD8+ T cell,which even reversed the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ T cell in 2 cynomolgus monkeys. Conclusion As the primate animal model most similar to human,both rhesus monkeys and cynomolgus monkeys are infected with H5N1 inoculation. Further analyses on changes of peripheral blood cell from H5N1 monkeys will be help for explain the disease.",

Method: C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into the normal group, the aging group and the intervention group. The aging group was radiated with X ray to establish the mice aging HSC model. The intervention group was orally administered with ASP during X-ray irradiation, while the normal group was orally administered with NS. Their HSCs were isolated by immunomagnetic beads. Cell cycles analysis and senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-Gal) staining were used to detect changes in aging HSCs. The expression of P53 was determined by western blot analysis. The length of telomere and the vitality of telomerase were analyzed by southern blot and TRAP-PCR, respectively. Result: Compared with the normal group, X-ray irradiation could significantly increase the cell ratio of in HSC G1 stage, rate of SA-\u03b2-Gal positive cells and expression of P53 protein, and reduce the length of telomere and the vitality of telomerase. Compared with the aging group, ASP could significantly inhibit the cell ratio of in HSC G1 stage and the increase in the number of SA-\u03b2-Gal positive cells, down-regulate the expression of P53 protein, and increase the length of telomere and the vitality of telomerase in HSCs. Conclusion: ASP could antagonize X-ray-induced aging of HSCs, which may be related to the increase in the length of telomere and the activity of telomerase, as well as the down-regulation of the expression of P53 protein.",

The accumulation amount of the litters under the forests was 13.40-46.32 t hm(-2), and in the order of P. tabulaeformis forest > P. wilsonii - B. platyphlla forest > L. principis-rupprechtii forest > P. wilsonii forest > C. multiglorus-R. xanthina shrubs > P. davidiana - B. platyphlla forest. The litter storage of coniferous forests was greater than that of broadleaved forests, and the storage percentage of semi-decomposed litters was all higher than that of un-decomposed litters. The maximum water-holding rate of the litters was 185.5%-303.6%, being the highest for L. principis-rupprechtii forest and the lowest for P. tabulaeformis forest. The litters' water-holding capacity changed logarithmically with their soaking time. For coniferous forests, un-decomposed litters had a lower water-holding rate than semi-decomposed litters; whereas for broadleaved forests, it was in adverse. The maximum water-holding capacity of the litters varied from 3.94 mm to 8.59 mm, and was in the order of P. tabulaeformis forest > L. principis-rupprechtii forest > P. wilsonii - B. platyphlla forest > P. wilsonii forest > C. multiglorus - R. xanthina shrubs > P. davidiana - B. platyphlla forest. The litters' water-holding capacity also changed logarithmically with immersing time, and the half-decomposed litters had a larger water-holding capacity than un-decomposed litters. The water-absorption rate of the litters presented a power function with immersing time. Within the first one hour of immersed in water, the water-absorption rate of the litters declined linearly; after the first one hour, the litters' water-absorption rate became smaller, and changed slowly at different immersed stages. Semi-decomposed litters had a higher water-absorption rate than un-decomposed litters. The effective retaining amount (depth) of the litters was in the order of P. wilsonii - B. platyphlla forest (5.97 mm) > P. tabulaeformis forest (5.59 mm) > L. principis-rupprechtii forest (5.46 mm) >P. wilsonii forest (4.30 mm) > C. multiglorus - R. xanthina shrubs (3.03 mm)>P. davidiana - B. platyphlla forest (2.13 mm).",

In recent several decades,the grassland is severely degraded because of global climatic change and artificial factors,which not only obviously restricts the economy development of pastoral areas and the improvement of living standard of local Tibetan people,but also directly threatens the ecological security of the Yellow River basin. The paper discusses the way of ecological rehabilitation of degraded grassland and puts forward countermeasures for consolidating treatment effect based on the analysis of present status and development trend of grassland in Maqu Country,according to the principles of ecological rehabilitation.",

        "abstract": "Different fertilizers were used in the moderately degraded grassland in Maqu County in order to study their impacts on plant community diversity and productivity. The results showed that fertilization increased the height and above-ground biomass of the degraded grassland vegetation. Among them,the height and aboveground biomass in the treatments of FYM and N-P-K increased by 221% and 227%,332% and 316%. Fertilization also reduced weeds,in contrast,enhancing the proportion of Gramineae and Cyperaceae plants. For example,in the P treatment,the weeds reduced by 32.90%,but Cyperaceae increased by 73.43%. Gramineae in the FYM treatment increased by 19.69 %. All the fertilized plots had increases of Cyperaceae,Gramineae and Leguminosae,but decrease of weeds. The species richness was also reduced due to fertilization except the FYM treatment. The N-P-K treatment had high Simpson's index of species,Shannon-Wiener index and Pielou evenness index. The FYM treatment had high richness and Simpson dominance index. Nitrogen fertilizer resulted in an increase of Pielou evenness index and Simpson dominance. Both P and K treatment decreased Simpson index,Shannon-Wiener index,Pielou evenness index,richness and Simpson dominance index. Based on our results,it can be concluded that using FYM and N-P-K can be benefit to rehabilitation of the degraded grassland.",

Some experiments on the piezopositioning stage of a scanning electrochemistry microscope elaborated the building process of the dynamic hsyteresis model, then the hardware-in-the-loop simulation of the open loop controller was made.

        "abstract": "A PID control scheme based on the genetic algorithm and neural network was proposed to improve the position accuracy of the micro-displacement stage of scanning tunneling microscope. The stage was actuated by the piezoelectric ceramic actuators and the flexible hinges were used as its guiding mechanism. After the principle of the stage was analyzed, its mathematical model was established. Because the stage was controlled by the neural-network PID controller in a closed routine, the weights of BP network were adjusted on-line and the parameters of PID controller can be changed in real-time to reduce the displacement error of stage. The initial weights were optimized by the global property of genetic algorithm to overcome the initial weight sensitivity and local convergence of neural network and improve the control effect of the PID controller. The tested results show that the stable error of a step of 12 \u03bcm is reduced from 3.24% to 2.55% and the response time is shortened from 1.7 s to 1.1 s.",

Furthermore,the parameter identification method of the dynamic hysteresis model constituting of Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) hysteresis operator is given. Experimental studies on the TRITOR100 piezopositioning stage indicate that the dynamic hysteresis model is more accurate than both the linear dynamic model and PI hysteresis model when the stage positioning is dynamically positioned at high speed in \u00b1900 V/s input voltage within 30 \u03bcm positioning range.

        "abstract": "As the positioning precision of piezo-actuators is always severely deteriorated by hysteresis nonlinear effect, this paper proposes a neural network control scheme with a hysteresis compensator based on sliding-mode technique to improve the performance of the piezo-actuators. A Radial Basic Function Neural Network (RBFNN) was developed as a equivalent control value in the sliding-mode control and the hysteresis compensator was used to estimate the lumped uncertainty caused by the varying parameters in the RBFNN, external disturbance and the approximate algorithm to compensate the output signal of the RBFNN. For the above steps, the dynamics of actuator was guaranteed on the sliding surface. The adaptive tuning laws of the network and the compensator were derived on the basis of Lyapunov stability theory, and the convergence and stability of the control system were proved theoretically. A low frequency triangle reference displacement with a variable amplitude was used to detect and analyze the effect of the proposed control method. Experimental results show that the mean and maximal positioning errors by the tradition neural network are 0.43 \u03bcm and 0.77 \u03bcm respectively, but these errors can be reduced to 0.27 \u03bcm and 0.49 \u03bcm under the sliding model controller. Finally, the positioning precision is approved evidently.",

The dynamic hysteresis model of the piezoelectric stage was established based on analysis of the nonlinear hysteresis characteristics of the piezoelectric ceramics and structure of the positioning stage. The hysteresis observer was applied to estimating the uncertain errors caused by displacement, transfer functions, hysteresis variables and disturbance. The output of the neural network controller was compensated to drive the stage to track the expected displacement. Adaptive law of the hysteresis observer was derived based on the Lyapunov stability theorem. Experimental results indicate that, with the application of the adaptive control system based on hysteresis observer, the mean positioning error of the stage for a reference sinusoid wave with the amplitude of 30 \u03bcm and the frequency of 1 Hz was reduced from 0.39 \u03bcm to 0.19 \u03bcm and the mean error of the unsymmetrical fitting to the hysteresis characteristics was reduced from 0.42 \u03bcm to 0.22 \u03bcm. The mean positioning error for a step input of 10 \u03bcm dropped from 0.22 \u03bcm to 0.13 \u03bcm, and the stability time was shortened from 0.19 s to 0.08 s.

NiW/CTS catalysts were then modified by surface impregnation of phosphoric acid or co-impregnation of phosphoric acid with metal precursors. The effect of phosphoric acid modification on the physic-chemical properties and hydrotreating performance of the NiW/CTS catalysts were investigated. The results showed that the phosphoric modification causes a decrease of acid amount in NiW/CTS; surface impregnation reduces Lewis acid sites, while co-impregnation enhances the Lewis acid sites. The presence of phosphoric acid in NiW/CTS can weaken the interaction between the support and metal components and improve the dispersion of active metals on the catalyst surface. The co-impregnation method can promote the formation of metal oxide precursor with high hydrogenation activity; therefore, NiW/CTS catalysts modified by phosphoric acid co-impregnation exhibits better performance in hydro-desulfurization, hydro-denitrogenation and hydro-dearomatics.",

The dispersity and sulfuration of the active metals were adjusted by adding organic modifiers to the Ni and/or W impregnation solution. Based on the experimental results, it was found that the dispersity of the active metals on the catalyst support was improved with organic modifiers dissolved in Ni and/or W impregnation solution. And increasing the amount of organic modifiers can not only increase the dispersity of main active phase WO 3 on the support, but also promote the formation of highly active nickel species in octahedral sites and of high hydrogenation phase NiWO 3. The calcination temperature can adjust the dispersity of active metals and acidity of the catalysts. The catalysts treated at optimized calcination temperature have appropriate ratio of weak and strong acidity sites and better hydrodesulfuration and hydrodenitrofication performance.",

It was observed that the increase of temperature, pressure and residence time all promoted the conversion of total nitrogen compounds (TN). The removal of basic nitrogen compounds (BN) was easier than that of non-basic compounds (NBN), and was also affected more significantly by the reaction conditions. As the increase of hydrogen/CGO volume ratio, the removal rate of both BN and NBN increased firstly and then decreased a little by hydrogenation. The kinetic study of the HDN reaction showed that the HDN reactions of BN and NBN both accorded with the pseudo-first order kinetic model. The HDN reaction rate of NBN was smaller and controlled the removal of total nitrogen compounds. The hydrogenation of N-hetero-cycle was the controlling step for the HDN of NBN.",

Their physic-chemical properties were determined by XRD, BET, H2-TPR and XPS, and their catalytic performance were evaluated through the hydrotreating reaction with thiophene or tetralin as feedstock. Based on the results of XRD, it can be concluded that the crystalline structure of supported nickel molybdenum nitrides was Ni2Mo3N. From H2-TPR analysis, it was found that the peak at low temperature range (200\u00b0C~400\u00b0C) was due to the reduction of surface oxygen on passivated nickel molybdenum nitrides. XPS results showed that there were Mo6+, Mo4+ and Mo\u03b4+ ions on the surface of supported nickel molybdenum nitrides, among which the content of Mo\u03b4+ ions was the most. Nickel molybdenum nitrides catalysts had good HDS activity and stability. But their HDA stability was not satisfied, especially with the presence of sulfur.",

The effects of phosphorus on the hydrotreating performance of the catalysts were examined. It was found that PY zeolite was of good crystalline form. In PY zeolite a part of phosphorus atoms were incorporated into the framework of Y zeolite and others were dispersed on the surface of Y zeolite with amorphous state, causing the Br\u00f6nsted acidity amount and total acidity amount of the zeolite decreased. Compared with the phosphorus modified catalysts prepared by other methods and non-phosphorus modified catalyst, the catalyst containing PY zeolite had larger pore volume and pore diameter as well as suitable acidity distribution, which ensured the diffusion of CGO molecules of larger volume and favored for the co-operation of hydrogenation and cracking performance of the catalyst, resulting in the better hydrotreating performance for CGO.",

The structure and acidity of the supports were further modified by P. Hydrotreating catalysts were prepared with Y/CTS as supports and Ni-W as active metal through the equal volume impregnation method. The effects of the mixed method and the content of HY zeolite in Y/CTS on the catalyst behavior were investigated. The results showed that the specific surface area and acidity of CTS can be adjusted by the addition of zeolite HY and the CTS structure retained with proper content of HY in Y/CTS; when the content of HY is more than 20%, the acidity amount of Y/CTS is higher than that of CTS, especially for the Bronsted acidity. P modification can adjust the acidity of the catalyst; the total acidity amount of the catalysts together with the fraction of Lewis acidity was increased. Shengli coker gas oil was used as feed stock to evaluate the hydrotreating performance of the catalysts. The results indicated that the hydrodesulferization (HDS) and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) performance can be improved by using the mixed support Y/CTS with P modification.",

        "abstract": "Nano-crystal Y zeolites with different silica-alumina ratio(Si/Al) were synthesized by changing the aging time of seeding gel and the alkalinity of synthetic mother liquor. The physicochemical properties and hydrocracking performance of the nano-crystal Y zeolites was investigated. Their crystal type,framework structure,pore structure,acidity,morphology and stability of the samples were analyzed by means of XRD,BET,NH3-TPD and SEM. Increasing the Si/Al can enhance the stability of nano-crystal Y zeolites and decrease the acid amounton the Y zeolite surface. Hydrocracking results indicated that the catalysts with nano-crystal Y zeolites as support had higher cracking activity than that with industrial Y zeolite as support. The catalyst with the nano-crystal Y zeolite with Si/Al of 5.2 as support exhibited the highest selectivity to light distillate and the highest yield of petro-chemical raw materials under the precondition of keeping high cracking activity.",

The sampling results showed that in order to get the minimum loss the optimal operation conditions were low reaction temperature, full feed load and no bed catalyst inventory when the olefin content requirement was not strict, or the low reaction temperature, full feed load and bed catalyst inventory were the choice. The catalytic cracking took the dominant position and the thermal cracking was the main cause for the loss of upgrading process. The effects of upgrading condition and the thermal cracking on the loss were consistent. The effect of reaction temperature was the greatest and that of feed load was the least. Hydrogen transfer coefficient increased greatly in condition with the bed catalyst inventory. The trend of the propylene yield and HTC was contrary. The optimal reaction condition for propylene yield was high reaction temperature and short reaction time.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate whether there are changes in the expression,at mRNA and protein level,of \u03b11 subunits of T-type(\u03b11G and\u03b11H) calcium channels in the human pulmonary vein antrum(PVA) tissue between sinal rhythm(SR) and atrial fibrillation(AF) patients.Methods The PVA tissue was obtained from two distinct groups of patients during the open-chest cardiac surgery,and the numbers of the patient were 34 for SR and 38 for AF,respectively.Real-time quantative RT-PCR was used to measure the abundance of mRNA of two different calcium channel subunits--\u03b11G and \u03b11H,by the 2-\u0394\u0394Ct method.Western-Blot was also used to examine the expression of these three channel proteins by a semi-quantative method.H-E and immuno-histochemistrical(IHC) staining are used to evaluate the morphological differences between two groups.Results In comparison with the SR group,the mRNA abundance and protein expression level of \u03b11H subunits was significantly up-regulated in the AF group(P<0.05).However,the level of \u03b11G subunit was not significantly different between two groups.The results of H-E and IHC staining are quit consistent with the data above,and prove that the protein of TTCC is located on the menbrane of myocardial cell.Conclusions The present study demonstrated that the expression of \u03b11H subunits of TTCC,but not \u03b11G subunit,was up-regulated in atrial fibrillation.",

        "abstract": "An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is the most commonly used circulatory assist device in cardiac surgery. We hypothesized that prophylactic application of an IABP improves early clinical outcome of high-risk patients undergoing scheduled off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCABG).From January 2010 to December 2013, hemodynamically stable, high-risk patients undergoing scheduled OPCABG with preincision use of an IABP were recruited to the IABP group. Using the propensity score-matching method, every patient in the IABP group was matched with another patient (the control group) with a similar propensity score who received an IABP on an as-needed basis during or after OPCABG. Surgical mortality and major morbidity rates were compared between groups.A total of 116 patient pairs were included in this study. In patients in the IABP group, postoperative low cardiac output and respiratory as well as renal failure were less frequent, intensive care unit stay was shorter, and surgical mortality was lower compared to patients in the control group. In multivariate logistic regression, timing of IABP implantation, as an independent risk factor, was associated with postoperative low cardiac output (OR = 2.02, 95% CI 1.28-5.76), respiratory failure (OR = 1.86, 95% CI 1.19-4.27), renal failure (OR = 2.96, 95% CI 1.51-6.63) and surgical mortality (OR = 2.45, 95% CI 1.42-6.07).Prophylactic application of an IABP improves postoperative cardiac performance, reduces respiratory and renal complications, and consequently lowers surgical mortality in high-risk patients undergoing scheduled OPCABG. \u00a9 2015 S.

        "abstract": "Smoking has numerous effects that may promote atherosclerosis, but the pathogenesis of smoking-related vein graft disease after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains incompletely understood. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) subtypes MMP-2 and MMP-9 have been identified as the key components in vascular remodeling processes. However little is known about the native MMP2 and MMP9 gene expression in saphenous vein (SV) conduits of heavy smokers undergoing CABG.Two hundred eight patients were divided into 6 groups: nonsmokers, heavy smokers, 3-month quitters, 6-month quitters, 12-month quitters, and long-term quitters. mRNA and protein levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) 1 and TIMP-2 were analyzed. In a clinical study, SV graft patency after surgical procedures was followed up.Compared with the nonsmoker group, MMP2 and MMP9 gene expression was significantly increased in the other 5 groups (p < 0.05). In contrast to MMP response, TIMP1 and TIMP2 gene expression was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). An association of increased MMP2 and MMP9 gene expression with poor SV graft patency could be found in the clinical data from follow-up.Heavy smoking noticeably increases native MMP2 and MMP9 gene expression in the SV before CABG. Even after long-term cessation of smoking, the dysregulated MMP2 and MMP9 gene expression cannot recover to normal levels. With the elevated native MMP2 and MMP9 gene expression in the SV induced by heavy smoking, more vein graft disease can be found on long-term follow-up.",

However, few studies investigated the correlation between preoperative glucose level and endogenous extracellular matrix (ECM)-related gene expression of saphenous vein (SV) conduits in diabetic patients.A total of 130 patients were divided into high-glucose (HG), low-glucose (LG) and control group according to the preoperative level of blood glucose. The expression of ECM-related genes was analysed by microarray.Compared with control group, 30 genes showed at least a threefold change in expression in HG group; up-regulation was observed in 24 genes. However, there were only 21 ECM-related genes showed at least a threefold change in expression between the LG and control group. Compared with HG group, matrix metalloproteinases' (MMPs) expression was significantly decreased in LG and control groups. In contrast to the decrease in MMPs' expression, expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) was increased.This study suggested that different preoperative diabetic status affected the expression of ECM-related genes in SV.

Methods:Myocardial tissues obtained from adult human heart were minced into pieces of 0.5 mm3 to 1.0mm3, and digested thrice for 5 min at 37 \u2103 with 0.2% trypsin and 0.1% collagenase IV. The remaining tissue fragments were cultured in complete explants medium (CEM) at 37 \u2103 in the presence of 5% CO2. About 3 to 4 weeks later, a layer of fibroblast-like cells were generated from the adherent explants over which small, round, phase-bright cells migrated. Collected these phase-bright cells by washing with D-Hanks and sorted with anti-c-kit-microbeads. Isolated cells were cultured with conditioned cardiosphere-growing medium (CCGM) and evaluated with flow cytometry. Results:Sorted phase-bright cells via MACS were cultured in CCGM. After 10 days the adherent cells sprout new round-bright cells at their cell body and form three-dimensional spheres. Flow cytometry demonstrated the phenotype of cells were c-kit+. Conclusion:A c-kit+ cell population has been obtained from adult human heart, which can form cardiospheres and can maintain the characterization of stem cells(c-kit+) in vitro culture.",

        "abstract": "Active smoking upregulated matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 gene expression in saphenous veins (SVs) before coronary operation. However, little is known about the effects of secondhand smoke (SHS), a smoking status that is more widely harmful to the general population, on MMP gene expression in SVs. Health effects of SHS were investigated mainly in nonsmokers married to smokers. Because the vast majority of women are nonsmokers in China, we had an opportunity to evaluate the relations between SHS and MMP gene expression in SVs of women patients before operation.A total of 258 woman patients were divided into three groups: control group, nonsmokers; SHS group, patients exposed to SHS until operation; active smoking group, patients who smoked a minimum of 1 package of cigarettes every day for more than 20 years. Messenger RNA and protein levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were analyzed. Saphenous vein graft patency after coronary operation was evaluated.The clinical backgrounds in the three groups were comparable. Compared with the control group, MMP-2 and MMP-9 gene expression was significantly increased in the SHS and active smoking groups (p<0.05). The degree of MMP gene expression changed by SHS or active smoking was comparable. A significant difference of SV graft patency was found among the three groups. An association of increased MMP gene expression with lowered SV graft patency was found in follow-up.Our data revealed that SHS had similar power as active smoking to affect MMP gene expression in SVs before operation and SV graft patency after coronary operation in women nonsmokers.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains the standard modality for local staging of gynecological malignancies, but it has several limitations, especially when differentiating a cancer limited to the endometrium from a cancer invading the superficial myometrium.To explore 1.5\u2009T diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in assessing superficial myometrial infiltration by endometrial carcinoma.We analyzed the sensitivity of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) versus fractional anisotropy (FA) in diagnosing superficial myometrial infiltration compared to DCE-MRI and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) in 35 patients with endometrial cancer. For each patient, T2WI-DWI fusion images were generated, and five regions of interest (ROIs) were placed on corresponding DTI images. ADC and FA were calculated, and fiber tractography (FT) images for each level were obtained. ADC and FA values for the five ROIs were compared.In distinguishing cancerous versus non-cancerous areas within superficial myometrium, median ADC values were significantly lower (1.16 vs. 1.48, respectively; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and median FA values were significantly higher (0.41 vs. 0.27; P\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively). ADC's versus FA's sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy for diagnosing superficial myometrial invasion were 74.3%, 88.6%, 86.7%, 77.5%, 81.4% versus 88.6%, 97.1%, 96.9%, 89.5%, 92.9%, respectively. T2WI and DCE-MR showed a sensitivity of 80.0% and 77.1%, respectively, in diagnosing myometrial invasion.Both ADC and FA were able to distinguish between cancerous verss non-cancerous areas within superficial myometrium (although FA was more sensitive based on AUC values). In addition, FA was superior to ADC, and more sensitive than T2WI and DCE-MR, in evaluating myometrial invasion. FT images provided visual confirmation of irregular arrangement and direction of the fibers due to proliferation of stromal cells caused by superficial myometrial invasion.",

Methods: Thirty-one cases were conducted with DSA-MRV with ellipitic centric ordered sequence, and the results were compared with 2D-TOF MRV results. Results: Among the 31 cases, DSA-MRV showed 10 cases normal, 11 dural sinus thrombosis, 9 intracranial arteriovenous malformations and one case of capillary hemangioma. Of 10 normal cases, one side of transverse sinus could be revealed in 6 cases in DSA-MRV but 2D-TOF MRV. Conclusion: DSA-MRV with ellipitic centric ordered sequence is a valuable approach in the diagnosis on vena encephali thrombosis, arteriovenous malformation with non-invasiveness and high definition.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the feasibility of applying R2* values to differentiate hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) from cavernous hemangiomas of the liver (CHL).This retrospective study was approved by the participating Institutional Review Board and written informed consent for all subjects were obtained. Seventy-three patients with 79 pathologically identified HCCs and 65 patients with 91 clinically or pathologically identified CHLs were enrolled in this study. All subjects underwent a breath-hold multi-echo T2* weighted MR imaging on a 1.5 T clinical MR scanner. R2* values from HCC and CHL groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney non-parametric U test. A cut-off value of R2* was evaluated with receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis.The mean R2* value was 23.32 \u00b1 12.23 Hz (95% confidence interval [CI]: 20.58 Hz, 26.06 Hz) for the HCC group, and 3.66 \u00b1 2.37 Hz (95% CI: 3.17 Hz, 4.15 Hz) for the CHL group. The mean R2* value for HCC was significantly higher than that of CHL (p<0.001). A threshold of 9.48 Hz for the minimum R2* value in the diagnosis of HCC resulted in a sensitivity of 96.20% (76 out of 79 patients), and a specificity of 97.80% (89 out of 91 patients). The positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and diagnostic accuracy for HCC were 97.44% (76 out of 78 patients), 96.74% (89 out of 92 patients) and 97.06% (165 out of 170 patients), respectively. The AUC for differentiation between these two groups was 0.994 (95% CI: 0.980, 1.000).R2* is a significant MRI biomarker to differentiate HCC from CHL with satisfying sensitivity and specificity.",

Ovarian cystic lesions were divided into endometrial cysts (group 1; n\u00a0=\u00a028), pyosalpinx and hydrosalpinx (group 2; n\u00a0=\u00a013), and ovarian cystic and cystic-solid tumors (group 3; n\u00a0=\u00a019). R2* (effective transverse relaxation rate) values were measured and pairwise comparison of the R2* values among the three groups was made using Kruskal-Wallis test. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to calculate cutoff values and performance of R2* values for distinguishing among groups. T1WI signal intensity and R2* value were also compared using area under curve values.R2* values for group 1 were statistically higher than groups 2 and 3 (15.37, 1.40, and 1.79\u00a0Hz, respectively; P\u00a0&amp;lt;\u00a00.001). The cutoff value for R2* was 7.43\u00a0Hz with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of 96.43, 87.50, 87.10, 96.55, and 91.67%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the R2* value and T1WI in diagnosing endometrial cysts.The R2* value provides an effective way to discriminate endometrial cysts from other ovarian cystic lesions.",

        "abstract": "Berberine, a natural isoquinoline alkaloid of many medicinal herbs, has an active function against a variety of microbial infections including Microsporum canis (M. canis). However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. To study the effect of berberine chloride on M. canis infection, a Digital Gene Expression (DGE) tag profiling was constructed and a transcriptome analysis of the M. canis cellular responses upon berberine treatment was performed. Illumina/Hisseq sequencing technique was used to generate the data of gene expression profile, and the following enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) and Pathway function were conducted based on the data of transcriptome. The results of DGE showed that there were 8476945, 14256722, 7708575, 5669955, 6565513 and 9303468 tags respectively, which was obtained from M. canis incubated with berberine or control DMSO. 8,783 genes were totally mapped, and 1,890 genes have shown significant changes between the two groups. 1,030 genes were up-regulated and 860 genes were down-regulated (P<0.05) in berberine treated group compared to the control group. Besides, twenty-three GO terms were identified by Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis, such as calcium-transporting ATPase activity, 2-oxoglutarate metabolic process, valine catabolic process, peroxisome and unfolded protein binding. Pathway significant enrichment analysis indicated 6 signaling pathways that are significant, including steroid biosynthesis, steroid hormone biosynthesis, Parkinson's disease, 2,4-Dichlorobenzoate degradation, and tropane, piperidine and Isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis. Among these, eleven selected genes were further verified by qRT-PCR. Our findings provide a comprehensive view on the gene expression profile of M. canis upon berberine treatment, and shed light on its complicated effects on M. canis.",

Three proteins were identified. W1 was Hsp20, W2 and W3 were transposon. Although the exact role of these proteins has not been characterized, the exclusive expression in virulent strain may indicate that they play an important role in the pathogenesis of Riemerella anatipestifer infection.

We used the Solexa sequencing technology to assess gene expression in skin tissues from full-sib Rex rabbits of different phenotypes in order to explore the molecular mechanisms associated with fur determination.Transcriptome analysis included de novo assembly, gene function identification, and gene function classification and enrichment. We obtained 74,032,912 and 71,126,891 short reads of 100 nt, which were assembled into 377,618 unique sequences by Trinity strategy (N50=680 nt). Based on BLAST results with known proteins, 50,228 sequences were identified at a cut-off E-value \u2265 10-5. Using Blast to Gene Ontology (GO), Clusters of Orthologous Groups (KOG) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), we obtained several genes with important protein functions. A total of 308 differentially expressed genes were obtained by transcriptome analysis of plaice and un-plaice phenotype animals; 209 additional differentially expressed genes were not found in any database. These genes included 49 that were only expressed in plaice skin rabbits. The novel genes may play important roles during skin growth and development. In addition, 99 known differentially expressed genes were assigned to PI3K-Akt signaling, focal adhesion, and ECM-receptor interactin, among others. Growth factors play a role in skin growth and development by regulating these signaling pathways. We confirmed the altered expression levels of seven target genes by qRT-PCR. And chosen a key gene for SNP to found the differentially between plaice and un-plaice phenotypes rabbit.The rabbit transcriptome profiling data provide new insights in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying rabbit skin growth and development.",

Cell proliferation activity was detected by CCK-8 assay. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to detect cell cycle and apoptotic changes. The HDAC activity of cells was measured by chemical colorimetry. The protein expressions of HDAC1, HDAC2, cyclin D1, CDK4, p16INK4A and p21 after 48 hour-treatment of Rh2 (S) (10, 20, 40, 60 \u03bcmol/L) were examined by Western blotting.The proliferation of K562 cells was inhibited by Rh2 (S) (20-80 \u03bcmol/L) in dose-and time-dependent manner. FCM analyses revealed that the number of the K562 cells treated with 60 \u03bcmol/L Rh2(S) was arrested in G0/G1 phase. The apoptosis rates of K562 cells were respectively (8.09\u00b10.86)%, (9.44\u00b10.53)% and (22.80\u00b12.16)% after induced by 20, 40, 60 \u03bcmol/L Rh2(S), which showed statistically significant difference (P<0.05) compared with the control group (2.63\u00b10.14)%. HDAC activity of the cells treated with Rh2(S) (40, 60 \u03bcmol/L) was reduced. Western blotting showed that the expressions of HDAC1, HDAC2, cyclin D1 and CDK4 decreased after induced by Rh2(S), and p16INK4A, p21 proteins were enhanced significantly.The Rh2(S) can inhibit the proliferation of K562 cells and induce its cycle arrest and apoptosis through inhibiting HDAC1 and HDAC2 activity, down-regulating the expression of cyclin D1 and activating p16INK4A and p21.",

Our previous study demonstrated that Rg1 had anti-tumor activity in K562 leukemia cells. The aim of this study was designed to investigate whether Rg1 could induce apoptosis in TF-1/Epo cells and further to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here we found that Rg1 could inhibit TF-1/Epo cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis in vitro in a concentration and time dependent manner. It also suppressed the expression of EpoR on the surface membrane and inhibited JAK2/STAT5 pathway activity. Rg1 induced up-regulation of Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and C-PAPR protein and down-regulation of Bcl-2 and AG490, a JAK2 specific inhibitor, could enhance the effects of Rg1. Our studies showed that EpoR-mediated JAK2/STAT5 signaling played a key role in Rg1-induced apoptosis in TF-1/Epo cells. These results may provide new insights of Rg1 protective roles in the prevention a nd treatment of leukemia.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the injury effect of high frequency electrocoagulation (HFE) by ultrafine-needle on the cutaneous capillary hemangiomas by histopathologic study of cock comb.32 male cocks were randomly divided into 4 groups with 8 animals in each group. 3 experimental groups received HFE with different power (6W, 8W, 10W) on the cock comb. Specimens were taken from cock combs for histologic study immediately after treatment and 7, 14, 21, 28 days later.After treatment, the cock combs turned pale and followed with scar formation. The shape of combs changed a lot after high power treatment. Immediately after treatment, the capillary number in the experimental groups decreased markedly under light microscope, compared with that in control group (P < 0.05). After that, the capillary number in experimental group increased. 7 days after treatment, the capillary number in experimental groups was still significantly lower than that in control groups (P < 0.01), but not markedly different between the three experiment groups (P > 0.05). Collagen formation also increased after treatment (P < 0.05), which was higher in experimental groups with high power (P < 0.05, correlation coefficient r > 0.5).HFE with ultrafine needle can effectively decrease the capillary number in cock comb. The 6W treatment is mini-invasive and will not destroy the comb shape with good cosmetic results. The technique may be used for the treatment of cutaneous capillary hemangioma.",

The cockscombs were treated. The specimens were taken on the 7th, 14th, 21th , and 28th day postoperatively. HE staining, immunohistochemical staining and special staining were performed for study of the number of capillary and collagen I/III , as well as elastic fibers.The color of cockscombs in group A became lightening after treatment. The number of capillary decreased as showing by HE staining. The collagen I and III in group B was significantly different from that in group A and C (P < 0.05). Special staining showed proliferation of elastic fibers in group B.It indicates that microneedle combined with Lauromacrogol could effectively reduce the capillary in cockscomb without any tissue fibrosis. Microneedle can stimulate the proliferation of elastic fiber, so as to improve the skin ageing process.",

The fluorinated proton donors were synthesized firstly and then their chemical structures measured by EA, FTIR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR. The existences of hydrogen bonds between the proton donors and acceptors were identified by FTIR. The liquid crystalline properties of these complexes were investigated by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), polarizing optical microscopy (POM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results indicated that these complexes with different alkoxy chains and numbers of lateral fluorine atoms exhibited different phase properties. Especially, when the alkoxy chains were short enough, the mesophase of the complexes disappeared. \u00a9 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

The anodic polarization experiments in 50\u03bcag/g Cl- solution indicate that Ecorr of the sample at a pulse bias of -800 V increases to about 714 mV, with an Icorr decrease of about two orders of magnitude. Studying on electrochemical corrosion mechanisms indicates that single layer films and gradient films become inactive by defect penetration through the substrate, hence decreased corrosion-resistance; while the inactivation of multi-layer films is due to layer malfunction, which makes it difficult for corrosive substances to reach the substrate. In this way the corrosion resistance is enhanced.",

In this study, CrN x film was prepared on the surface of depleted uranium by unbalance magnetron sputtering ion plating to improve its corrosion resistance. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to characterize the chemical state and depth profiles of Cr, N and O elements. XRD was employed to examine the phase structure of CrN x film. The corrosion behavior of the samples was measured by using polarization curves (E/I). The results show that CrN x film prepared by unbalance magnetron sputtering has good density and corrosion resistance. The phase composition of CrN x films is composed with Cr, CrN and Cr 2N when the N 2 flow is lower. After a layer of CrN x is deposited on the surface of uranium, the corrosion potential increases about 465 mV, while the corrosion current density decreases significantly. It is indicated that the corrosion resistance of depleted uranium is effectively improved after depositing CrN x thin film by unbalance magnetron sputtering.",

The correlations between the outcome of a single ESWL session and the patients' age, gender, body mass index (BMI), disease duration, pretreatment renal colic, hematuria, urinary irritation symptoms, stone location, stone laterality, stone length and stone width were analyzed. The statistically significant factors identifies were further analyzed by multivariate logistic regression, and the predictive model was established.The stone-free rate of ESWL was 76.9%. Univariate analysis found that the patients' age, stone laterality, stone location, disease duration, pretreatment hematuria, stone length and width all significantly affected the outcome of the treatment. Logistic regression analysis indicated the factors including disease duration, pretreatment hematuria, stone length and stone width determined the success rate of the treatment. Hosmer and Lemeshow Test showed a good fitting of the predictive model (\u03a7(2)=18.144, df=8, P=0.168) with an overall accuracy of 87.4%.Disease duration, pretreatment hematuria, stone length and width are independent factors affecting the outcome of a single ESWL session for single renal calculus.",

Chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression were used to identity the significant risk factors.Seven factors, namely recipient age, acute graft rejection, pre-transplantation dialysis, delayed graft function recovery, recipient peak PRA level, donor CMV positivity and the use of MMF were found to significantly correlate to post-transplant CMV pneumonia. Multivariate logistic regression further confirmed that donor CMV IgG positivity, acute graft rejection and pre-transplantation dialysis for over 6 months were independent factors to predict the occurrence of CMV pneumonia.Acute graft rejection control, appropriate donor selection and shortened dialysis before the transplantation can be crucial factors to reduce the incidence of CMV pneumonia after renal transplantation.",

With CTX as the control, one-way MLC system of BALB/c and C57BL mouse was treated with the same concentrations of TSA, and IL-2 expression in the T cells was observed by flow cytometry.TSA inhibited the proliferation of T cells in the MLC in a time- and dose-dependent fashion.

Effects of the Ni concentration on the structure, physical and chemical properties were examined using BET, H 2 -TPR, XRD, and UV\u2013vis DRS. Hydrotreating catalysts were prepared with CYCTS or NiC m as supports and Ni\u2013tungsten (W) as metal components. The hydrotreating performances of the catalysts were examined with Liaohe coker gas oil (CGO) as feedstock. The results indicated that the Ni preimpregnated supports had suitable mesoporous structure and surface area, and the TiO 2 particles size become smaller. At the same time, the Ni preimpregnation method could promote the formation of highly active nickel species in octahedral sites and improved the dispersivity of WO 3 . The hydrotreating performances of the Ni\u2013W catalysts using the NiC m supports for Liaohe CGO had been remarkably promoted, especially the hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) performance.",

The effects of HY zeolite pretreatment and Y/CTS modification with P and F for adjusting the acidity of the support were studied. The results showed that the structure of Y/CTS was in the form of CTS as shell and HY zeolite particles as core. The content of HY zeolite affected the acidity, acidity distribution and pore structure of Y/CTS. The density of strong acid sites on the HY zeolite surface could be partly reduced by dealumination with citric acid. This reduced the CTS coverage on the outer surface of the HY zeolite, leading to the increased acidity of Y/CTS. The acidity distribution of the support could also be adjusted by P and F modification. Hydrotreating catalysts were prepared with Y/CTS as support. The catalysts were tested using the hydrotreating reaction of a coker gas oil (CGO). The experimental results showed that the catalyst hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) performance could be remarkably improved by adjusting the acidity of the catalyst support via HY zeolite pretreatment and P and F modification. The catalysts with proper Br\u00f6nsted (B) acidity and Lewis (L) acidity behaved well in hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and HDN performances.",

        "abstract": "Asphaltenes-free vacuum resid derived deasphalted oils (DAOs) from Chinese Liaohe (LDAO) and Venezuela Orinoco (VDAO) were subjected to catalytic hydrotreating. Electrospray ionization (ESI) Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) analyses were performed on LDAO and VDAO before and after hydrotreating to determine the structural composition transformation of nitrogen-containing compounds as a result of hydrotreating. The results showed that the basic nitrogen contents of the two DAO before and after hydrotreating were relatively constant. However, the neutral nitrogen contents of hydrotreated LDAO and VDAO were dramatically reduced. The LDAO had a higher neutral nitrogen conversion than VDAO, even though LDAO had a higher neutral nitrogen content than VDAO prior to hydrotreating. The significant difference in nitrogen removal for the DAOs was due to the structural variation of the neutral nitrogen compounds. By plotting the double bond equivalent (DBE) value as a function of carbon number for N1 class species, the hydrodenitrogenation reactivities of nitrogen compounds could be classified as easy- and hard-to-convert nitrogen compounds. The easy-to-convert nitrogen compounds have more unsaturated cores and have less and/or shorter alkyl side chains than the hard-to-convert nitrogen compounds which have long alkyl side chains. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

The CYCTS composite support was composed of TiO2-SiO2 mixed oxides and Y zeolite. The CMcat was prepared by the method of adding citric acid into the impregnant when the metal component was loading. The properties and the catalytic performance of hydrotreating CGO of CMcat were examined. The physical and chemical properties of the catalysts were investigated with BET, FT-IR, NH3-TPD, XRD, and TG-DSC. The results showed that citric acid as chelating agent could increase the dispersivity of active metals on the surface of the catalysts. At the same time, citric acid could change the cocordination state of active metals and promote the formation of single polytungstate species and highly active nickel species in octahedral sites.

        "abstract": "The effects of metal-modified acidic co-supports on the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) activity and isomerization selectivity of highly refractory organosulfur compounds such as 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene have been investigated. Y zeolite crystals with high Si/Al ratios and small crystallite sizes were successfully synthesized by a new hydrothermal synthesis approach. The synthesized Y zeolite crystals were ion-exchanged and stabilized. The prepared samples were then modified with different gallium contents using an impregnation method to adjust their acidity properties, and these modified samples were used as co-supports for NiMo sulfide HDS catalysts. The catalyst containing 10\u2005wt.% zeolite Y modified by 2\u2005wt.% gallium (NiMo/2GaY-ASA-A) exhibited the highest HDS activity, with 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT) conversion nearly double the rate of the catalyst without zeolite at 563\u2005K, 4.0\u2005MPa and liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of 40\u2005h . NiMo/2GaY-ASA-A also exhibited superior isomerization ability, with 3,4'-DMBP, 4,4'DMBP, and 3,6-DMDBT as the main products, indicating that the isomerization pathway was the main reaction route over NiMo/2GaY-ASA-A. The superior catalytic performance is related to the synergistic effect of the proper amount of medium and strong Br\u00f8nsted acid sites. The compounds 3,6-DMDBT and 3,7-DMDBT (isomers of 4,6-DMDBT) and 3,4,6-TMDBT and tetra-methyl-DBT (transmethyl products) were detected simultaneously in the HDS product of 4,6-DMDBT for the first time over NiMo/GaY-ASA-A catalysts. Finally, a new reaction network over NiMo/2GaY-ASA-A was proposed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The inhibiting effects of nitrogen compounds on the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of thiophene-series sulfur compounds in straight-run gas oil over a NiW/Al 2 O 3  catalyst were studied. The nitrogen compounds investigated here were quinoline and indole; nitrogen to sulfur mass ratios (N/S) varying from 0.9 to 1.2 were comparably studied. The results showed that quinoline was much easier to be converted but harder to be denitrogenated as compared with indole. Quinoline displayed stronger inhibiting effects on the HDS of individual sulfur compounds in the gas oil than that of indole. Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood type rate equations were used to compare the nitrogen inhibiting effects. The nitrogen inhibiting effects on these thiophene series sulfur compounds decreased in the order 4,6-DMDBT(4,6-dimethyl-dibenzothiophene)\u00a0u003e\u00a04-MDBT\u00a0u003e\u00a0C1DBT\u00a0u003e\u00a0DBT\u00a0u003e\u00a0C2-C3DBT.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Density functional theory (DFT) calculation with numerical atomic functions is used to study oxygen effects on MoS 2  hydrotreating active sites. The optimal form of oxygen on active sites is first investigated by experimentation and calculation. Then, the fine structures of a MoS 2  nanocluster (S-Mo-S) and an oxygen containing MoS 2  nanocluster (O-Mo-S) under reaction conditions, as well as their hydrodesulfurization (HDS) selectivity towards thiophene, are calculated. The results show that bent MoS 2  nanoclusters in supported hydrotreating catalysts are more thermodynamically stable when oxygen is substituted for sulfur on the basal plane. Oxygen also reduces the electron density and unoccupied d-orbital energy levels of Mo atoms. The S atoms on the Mo-edge are also more readily substituted by H on O-Mo-S. During thiophene HDS, O-Mo-S has a stronger thiophene adsorption ability than S-Mo-S. Hydrogen transfer has a higher energy requirement along the Mo-edge on O-Mo-S than on S-Mo-S. The hydrogenation saturation activity to C C is lower on the Mo-edge of O-Mo-S than of S-Mo-S, whereas the hydrogenolysis activity at the C S bond is promoted by oxygen. It is predicted that the oxygen can increase the hydrogenolysis selectivity of a MoS 2  active nanocluster.",

        "abstract": "The effects of the method of modifying USY zeolite with nickel on the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT) have been investigated. USY zeolites were modified with a small amount of Ni by three different methods, namely, the in situ synthesis method, the ion-exchange method, and the impregnation method, and the resulting Ni-modified USY zeolites were used as supports for NiMo sulfide catalysts. We found that the Ni modification method affects the textural properties, the acidity of the Ni-modified USY zeolites, the Ni\u2013Mo\u2013S active-phase morphology, the dispersion of the active metals, the structure of the Ni\u2013Mo\u2013S active phase, the sulfidation degree of the active metals, the 4,6-DMDBT HDS reaction rate constant, the turnover frequency, and the selectivity of the 4,6-DMDBT HDS pathways. Although the impregnation modification method was found to promote the dispersion of active metals most strongly and the ion-exchange modification method was found to enhance the sulfidation ...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   USY zeolites have been modified by incorporation of gallium, phosphorus and a combination of gallium and phosphorus by wetness impregnation method using gallium nitrate and ammounium phosphate diabasic, and the corresponding NiMo supported hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalysts have been prepared for HDS of an inferior FCC diesel. The individual physical-chemical properties of the modified USY zeolites and the series NiMo supported catalysts were characterized using XRD, N 2 -adsorption-desorption(BET), NH 3 -TPD, Py-FTIR, H 2 -TPR, HRTEM and XPS methods, and their catalytic performances for an inferior FCC diesel HDS were assessed. The results show that both gallium and phosphorus modification can modulate the acid property of USY zeolite and weaken the interaction between the active metal and the supports, thus enhancing the degree of sulfidation and the dispersion of Mo species that are beneficial for the HDS of highly refractory organosulfur compounds. The highest HDS and HDN efficiencies of 99.7% and 99.6%, respectively, were observed over the catalyst containing the PGaUSY zeolite. More importantly, gallium modification of the USY zeolite promotes the hydrodesulfurization of all organosulfur compounds, and especially 4,6-DMDBT, in the FCC diesel and phosphorus modification of the USY zeolite promotes the hydrodesulfurization of most organosulfur compounds except for 4,6-DMDBT in the FCC diesel.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Mesoporous Y composites which exhibit both crystallized micropores and large mesopores with narrow mesopore diameter distributions and controlled pore diameters were successfully synthesized. The composite is synthesized through an elaborate design of the SiO 2 @cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (SiO 2 @CTAB) micelle swelled by an appropriate amount of 1,3,5-trimenthylbenzene (TMB); it is subsequently fabricated from the condensing of the Y zeolite precursors, which contain Y zeolite seeds, on the mesoscale micelle followed by a hydrothermal crystallization process. The effect of synthesis conditions such as the amounts of CTAB, TMB and TEOS added to the synthesis system on the physicochemical properties of the obtained products was examined. The as-synthesized materials were carefully characterized by employing XRD, N 2  adsorption\u2013desorption, SEM, TEM and pyridine-adsorbed FTIR techniques. The mesoporous Y zeolite exhibited both the typical diffraction characteristics of Y zeolites in the wide-angle XRD pattern, and the typical diffraction characteristics of a narrowly dispersed mesopore structure in the small-angle XRD pattern is successfully synthesized for the first time. Finally, the adsorption capacity for DBT and 4,6-DMDBT by samples with different mesopore diameters were assessed by a batch method. Sample MY-0.5C-0.35T-0.9B showed the highest capacity for adsorbing DBT in model diesel, and sample MY-0.5C-0.35T-1.5B showed the highest capacity for adsorbing 4,6-DMDBT in model diesel. Most importantly, sample MY-0.5C-0.35T-1.5B showed the highest adsorptive rate for both DBT and 4,6-DMDBT, which is at least 10 times faster than that of sample MY-0C-0.35T-0B because of the elimination of the diffusion limitation.",

The synthesized samples were characterized by both wide and small angle XRD, N 2  adsorption-desorption isotherms, pyridine adsorbed FTIR (Py-FTIR),  27 Al MAS NMR, H 2 -TPR, HRTEM and XPS. The results show that the synthesized samples exhibit wide opened mesopores of varying sizes with well crystallized pore walls. The introduction of mesopores caused a slight decline in the interaction between active metals and support (MSI) in the corresponding catalysts, generating higher stacking numbers and a shorter slab lengths among MoS 2  crystals on the corresponding catalyst and favoring both the dispersion and sulfidation of Mo species, particularly favoring the formation of both active edge sites and highly active corner active sites. The reaction network for 4,6-DMDBT HDS over NiMo/HMY-x series catalysts is proposed, and HDS selectivity is found to be related to mesopore size. More specifically, HYD activity is linearly correlated to the number of Mo atoms located along the edge sites of MoS 2  crystals, and DDS activity is linearly correlated with the number of Mo atoms located at the corner sites of MoS 2  crystals. Finally, the active corner sites are approximately 10 times more active than active edge sites.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A series of Zr incorporated small crystal size Y zeolites were successfully synthesized by a direct hydrothermal method, and the corresponding NiW catalysts were prepared for the hydrocracking of vacuum gas oil (VGO). The synthesized zeolites and prepared catalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM, FTIR, Pyridine FTIR, H 2 -TPR and TEM techniques. The results show that the synthesized zeolites have uniform morphology and small crystal size, while Zr 4+  incorporated into the framework of Y zeolite has been confirmed by XRD and FTIR. The amount of acid sites of xZrY zeolite slightly increases compared with that of Y zeolite by Pyridine FTIR. Moreover, the Zr 4+  incorporation into Y zeolite can increase the W species reducibility, modulate the length and stacking of WS 2  phase, and enhance the W species dispersion on the catalyst surface by H 2 -TPR and TEM, which favor to improve the hydrogenation activity of the catalyst to tune the balance between cracking activity and hydrogenation/dehydrogenation activity. Hence, the catalyst containing xZrY zeolite exhibits not only higher yield and selectivity of middle distillate but also slightly higher conversion of VGO compared with the catalyst containing Y zeolite.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Experiments and calculations are combined to study the Nb substitution effects on the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) performance of 4,6-DMDBT catalyzed using the Ni-Mo bimetal hydrotreating catalysts. In the experimental parts, a series of Nb post-modified NiMo/Al 2 O 3  HDS catalysts are prepared and characterized. Then, the HDS performance of the 4,6-DMDBT is assessed using this Nb-NiMo/Al 2 O 3.  In the calculations part, the Ni-Mo-S active nanocluster model with different Nb substitution degrees for the Mo-edge and Ni-edge are established. The Nb stability on the Ni-Mo-S active sites and the Nb effects on the properties of the active sites are analyzed. Meanwhile, the key elementary reactions of the direct hydrodesulfurization (DDS) route and the hydrogenation reaction (HYD) route on the Ni-Mo-S active sites are calculated. The experiments show that the introduction of Nb leads to the agglomeration of the NiMo phase in the oxidation state. Also, the introduction of Nb will increase the length and stacking number of the NiMoS phase. Partial Nb species will convert to Nb 2+  during the sulfuration process. A moderate Nb introduction will enhance the HDS conversion rate, the DDS selectivity and the TOF of the 4,6-DMDBT, whereas these factors will decrease when excess Nb is introduced. The DFT calculations show that the Nb could be stable on the S-edge and Mo-edge with various substitution rates. The Nb will spatially expand the molecular orbital on the active sites, and it has a stronger interaction with the H 2 S, active hydrogen, 4,6-DMDBT and its DDS intermediate in general. The partial Nb substitution enhances the C\u2013S bond cleavage. The full Nb substitution hinders the C\u2013S bond cleavage, but it favors the hydrogen saturation of the S-4Nb. The calculations could explain the experiments in which the DDS selectivity of the 4,6-DMDBT increases with the Nb introduction at first and then decreases as the Nb introduction continues to increase.",

        "abstract": "A series of Al\u2013SBA-15 (Al-15) materials was prepared by direct synthesis method with a broad range of Si/Al molar ratios (X = 40, 20, 10, 5, and 2.5), and the corresponding NiMoS/Al-15(X) catalysts were used to perform the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) reaction with dibenzothiophene (DBT). The prepared samples were characterized by N2 physisorption, ICP-OES, powder XRD, 27Al MAS NMR, H2-TPR, pyridine-FTIR and HRTEM. Al\u2013SBA-15(10) had the highest number of Bronsted acid sites and the total acid density of silica\u2013alumina supports increased with Al loading. The enhanced acidity of the Al-15-type materials led to higher catalyst activity compared to those of NiMo/\u03b3-Al2O3 and NiMo/SBA-15. A suitable stacking of the NiMoS slabs favors the hydrogenation reaction of DBT while introduction of Al into the silica supports can help the hydrogenolysis of the C\u2013S bond. The acid density and surface roughness of the support (the surface periodicity of the support in the atomic scale) impact the morphology of the active phase, which, in turn, affects the reaction selectivity of DBT HDS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A non-periodic computational Co          Mo          S model consisting of un-promoted Mo-edge (Mo-E), Co-mixed Mo-edge (Mo-X), Co-edge (Co-E) and corner (Corner) sites was used to examine the structural effect of Co          Mo          S nanocluster on its hydrodesulfurization (HDS) reaction activity. A density functional theory (DFT) with numerical atomic functions was used to predict the fine structures of Mo-E, Mo-X, Co-E and Corner under common HDS condition. The elementary thiophene HDS reactions on Mo-X, Co-E and Corner sites were compared. The results show that the Mo-E has short and long Mo          S bonds; the former is more stable. The hydrogen dissociation on short Mo          S bond is endothermic and with high activation energy, whereas the hydrogen dissociation on long Mo          S bond is just the opposite. The Mo-X has only short Mo          S bonds. The Co atoms on the Mo-X and Corner exhibit a square planar coordinated structure with four sulfur atoms with a Co          Mo atom pair. The Co          Mo atom pair can easily form coordinatively unsaturated active site (CUS) by H 2 S desorption. The CUSs on the Mo-X and Corner sites preferably bond with radical containing sulfides to spin-restricted sulfides, leading to high hydrogenolysis activity of the C          S bonds. The di-sulfur atom pairs on the Co-E and Corner sites are effective to dissociate the hydrogen molecule and reduce steric hindrance from adsorbing sulfur intermediates during HDS, leading to high hydrogenation activity at the Co-E and Corner sites. Thiophene HDS reactions can process completely on the Corner site which contains Co          Mo and di-sulfur atom pairs. Hence, increasing Corner sites in Co          Mo          S is effective and beneficial to HDS catalysis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To study the substituent effects of 4,6-dimethyl-dibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT) on the direct hydrodesulfurization (DDS) routes catalyzed on a Ni-Mo-S nanocluster, a non-periodic computational Ni-Mo-S model is established, and density functional theory (DFT) is used to comparatively calculate the adsorption and the conversion of the dibenzothiophene (DBT) and 4,6-DMDBT on the Ni-S-edge, Ni-Mo-edge and corner sites of the Ni-Mo-S active nanocluster. The calculation results show that on the Ni-Mo-S active nanocluster, the Ni-S-edge could stably provide active hydrogen, whereas the C S bond cleavage on this active site required higher activation energy. The Ni-Mo-edge could not stably provide active hydrogen, and this active site has the highest activity of C S bond cleavage. The corner site shows favorable ability of hydrogen activation and C S bond cleavage. The methyl group of 4,6-DMDBT weakens the Ni S bonds caused by the adsorption on the Ni-S-edge, where the decrease of the adsorption energy is compensated by an additional dispersion provided by two methyl groups. The two methyl groups also decrease the adsorption angle between the 4,6-DMDBT and the CUS sites on the Ni-Mo-edge and corner sites. The flat adsorption of 4,6-DMDBT will further hinder the hydrogen activation and transfer on the Ni-Mo-edge. Moreover, the methyl group of 4,6-DMDBT decreases the energy difference between the reactant and the intermediate of the DDS route, increasing the reaction energy of the C S bond cleavage. The dominant DDS route of the DBT and 4,6-DMDBT involves the interaction between active hydrogen and the \u03b1-C followed by the movement of the newly formed aromatic ring away from the S atom of the sulfur compounds. During this process, the methyl groups of the 4,6-DMDBT will hinder the C S bond cleavage on all CUS sites on the Ni-S-edge, Ni-Mo-edge and corner sites of the Ni-Mo-S nanocluster. Therefore, the activation energy of the C S bond cleavage of 4,6-DMDBT is higher than that of DBT, and this is the main reason for the lower DDS rate of the former compared to the latter.",

        "abstract": "The liver provides vital metabolic, exocrine and endocrine functions in the body as such pathological conditions of the liver lead to high morbidity and mortality. The liver is highly regenerative and contains facultative stem cells that become activated during injury to replicate to fully recover mass and function. Canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling plays an important role in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of liver progenitor cells during liver regeneration. However, possible roles of noncanonical Wnts in liver development and regeneration remain undefined. We previously established a reversibly-immortalized hepatic progenitor cell line (iHPx), which retains hepatic differentiation potential. Here, we analyze the expression pattern of the essential components of both canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways at different postnatal stages of mouse liver tissues and iHPx cells. We find that noncanonical Wnt4, Wnt5a, Wnt9b, Wnt10a and Wnt10b, are highly expressed concordantly with the high levels of canonical Wnts in late stages of liver tissues. Wnt5a, Wnt9b, Wnt10a and Wnt10b are able to antagonize Wnt3a-induced \u03b2-catenin/TCF activity, reduce the stemness of iHPx cells, and promote hepatic differentiation of liver progenitors. Stem cell implantation assay demonstrates that Wnt5a, Wnt9b, Wnt10a and Wnt10b can inhibit cell proliferation and promote hepatic differentiation of the iHPx progenitor cells. Our results strongly suggest that noncanonical Wnts may play an important role in fine-tuning Wnt/\u03b2-catenin functions during liver development and liver regeneration. Thus, understanding regulatory mechanisms governing proliferation and differentiation of liver progenitor cells may hold great promise to facilitate liver regeneration and/or progenitor cell-based therapies for liver diseases.",

Here, we demonstrate that novel hybrid materials consisting of gelatin-derived graphene and silicate nanosheets of Laponite (GL) are biocompatible and promote osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Homogeneous cell attachment, long-term proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs on a GL-scaffold were confirmed using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. GL-powders made by pulverizing the GL-scaffold were shown to promote bone morphogenetic protein (BMP9)-induced osteogenic differentiation. GL-powders increased the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts but decreased the ALP activity in more-differentiated immortalized mouse adipose-derived cells. Note, however, that GL-powders promoted BMP9-induced calcium mineral deposits in both MSC lines, as assessed using qualitative and quantitative alizarin red assays. Furthermore, the expression of chondro-osteogenic regulator markers such as Runx2, Sox9, osteopontin, and osteocalcin was upregulated by the GL-powder, independent of BMP9 stimulation; although the powder synergistically upregulated the BMP9-induced Osterix expression, the adipogenic marker PPAR\u03b3 was unaffected. Furthermore, in vivo stem cell implantation experiments demonstrated that GL-powder could significantly enhance the BMP9-induced ectopic bone formation from MSCs. Collectively, our results strongly suggest that the GL hybrid materials promote BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and hold promise for the development of bone tissue engineering platforms.",

        "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the most common and aggressive types of human cancers worldwide. Nearly a half of HNSCC patients experience recurrence within five years of treatment and develop resistance to chemotherapy. Thus, there is an urgent clinical need to develop safe and novel anticancer therapies for HNSCC. Here, we investigate the possibility of repurposing the anthelmintic drug mebendazole (MBZ) as an anti-HNSCC agent. Using the two commonly-used human HNSCC lines CAL27 and SCC15, we demonstrate MBZ exerts more potent anti-proliferation activity than cisplatin in human HNSCC cells. MBZ effectively inhibits cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and cell migration, and induces apoptosis of HNSCC cells. Mechanistically, MBZ can modulate the cancer-associated pathways including ELK1/SRF, AP1, STAT1/2, MYC/MAX, although the regulatory outcomes are context-dependent. MBZ also synergizes with cisplatin in suppressing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis of human HNSCC cells. Furthermore, MBZ is shown to promote the terminal differentiation of CAL27 cells and keratinization of CAL27-derived xenograft tumors. Our results are the first to demonstrate that MBZ may exert its anticancer activity by inhibiting proliferation while promoting differentiation of certain HNSCC cancer cells. It's conceivable the anthelmintic drug MBZ can be repurposed as a safe and effective agent used in combination with other frontline chemotherapy drugs such as cisplatin in HNSCC treatment.",

        "abstract": "Tooth is a complex hard tissue organ and consists of multiple cell types that are regulated by important signaling pathways such as Wnt and BMP signaling. Serious injuries and/or loss of tooth or periodontal tissues may significantly impact aesthetic appearance, essential oral functions and the quality of life. Regenerative dentistry holds great promise in treating oral/dental disorders. The past decade has witnessed a rapid expansion of our understanding of the biological features of dental stem cells, along with the signaling mechanisms governing stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. In this review, we first summarize the biological characteristics of seven types of dental stem cells, including dental pulp stem cells, stem cells from apical papilla, stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth, dental follicle precursor cells, periodontal ligament stem cells, alveolar bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and MSCs from gingiva. We then focus on how these stem cells are regulated by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and/or Wnt signaling by examining the interplays between these pathways. Lastly, we analyze the current status of dental tissue engineering strategies that utilize oral/dental stem cells by harnessing the interplays between BMP and Wnt pathways. We also highlight the challenges that must be addressed before the dental stem cells may reach any clinical applications. Thus, we can expect to witness significant progresses to be made in regenerative dentistry in the coming decade.",

        "abstract": "Axis inhibition (Axin) is an important negative regulator of the Wnt pathway. This study investigated the relationship between Axin expression and sensitivity to X-rays in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to find a useful indicator of radiosensitivity.Tissue from NSCLC patients, A549 cells, and BE1 cells expressing Axin were exposed to 1-Gy of X-radiation. Axin and p53 expression levels were detected by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-PCR. Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling) assay and FACS (fluorescence-activate cell sorter) analysis. Caspase-3 activity was determined by Western blotting. Phospho-JNK expression was determined by immunofluorescence.The expression of Axin was significantly lower in NSCLC tissues than in normal lung tissues (p < 0.05). Axin expression correlates with differentiation, TNM staging, and lymph node metastasis of NSCLC (p < 0.05). Its expression negatively correlates with the expression of p53(mt) (p=0.000) and positively correlates with apoptosis (p=0.002). The prognosis of patients with high expression of Axin was better than those with low expression. X-radiation increases Axin expression in NSCLC tissue, and caspase-3 is significantly higher in samples in which Axin is increased (p < 0.05). Both X-radiation and Axin induce apoptosis of A549 and BE1 cells; however, the combination of the two enhances the apoptotic effect (p < 0.05). In A549 cells, inhibition of p53 blocks Axin-induced apoptosis, whereas in BE1 cells, the JNK pathway is required.Axin induces the p53 apoptotic pathway in cells where this pathway is intact; however, in cells expressing p53(mt), Axin induces apoptosis via the JNK pathway. Elevated Axin expression following X-ray exposure is a reliable indicator for determining the radiosensitivity of NSCLC.",

Axis inhibition protein (axin) is an important negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. Our aims were to examine the relationship between axin and TCF-4 and to explore the effects of axin on the development of lung cancer.Expression levels of axin and TCF-4 were examined in 107 lung cancer specimens by immunohistochemistry. The axin gene was transfected into lung cancer BE1 cells. The expression levels of axin, beta-catenin, and TCF-4 were detected with immunofluorescence and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments. Apoptosis, proliferation, and the invasive ability of lung cancer cells were examined using flow cytometry, 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT), and Matrigel invasive assays.Preserved axin expression correlated negatively with TCF-4 expression (P = .031). Axin expression differed with respect to degree of differentiation (P = .025) and histological tumor type (P = .031). TCF-4 expression differed relative to tumor, node metastasis (TNM) stage (P = .024). BE1 cells transfected with axin (BE1-axin cells) exhibited a significant decrease in TCF-4 expression. The level of apoptosis in BE1-axin cells was significantly increased, while the proliferative and invasive abilities of BE1-axin cells were decreased.These results suggest that reduced expression of axin or augmented expression of TCF-4 is associated with the malignant behavior of lung cancers. Overexpression of axin can downregulate expression of TCF-4 and can inhibit the ability of lung cancer cells to proliferate and invade.",

        "abstract": "p120-catenin, a member of the Armadillo gene family, has emerged as both a master regulator of cadherin stability and an important modulator of small GTPase activities. Therefore, it plays novel roles in tumor malignant phenotype, such as invasion and metastasis. We have reported previously that abnormal expression of p120-catenin is associated with lymph node metastasis in lung squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and adenocarcinomas. To investigate the role and possible mechanism of p120-catenin in lung cancer, we knocked down p120-catenin using small interfering RNA (siRNA). We found that ablation of p120-catenin reduced the levels of E-cadherin and beta-catenin proteins, as well as the mRNA of beta-catenin. Furthermore, p120-catenin depletion inactivated RhoA, but increased the activity of Cdc42 and Rac1, and promoted proliferation and the invasive ability of lung cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our data reveal that p120-catenin gene knockdown enhances the metastasis of lung cancer cells, probably by either depressing cell-cell adhesion due to lower levels of E-cadherin and beta-catenin, or altering the activity of small GTPase, such as inactivation of RhoA and activation of Cdc42/Rac1.",

        "abstract": "P120-catenin plays an important role in cell adhesion and signalling transduction though the function of its isoforms is unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the expression of p120-catenin isoforms in lung cancer and investigate their relationship to clinicopathological factors in lung squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and adenocarcinomas. The expression patterns of p120-catenin in lung cancer tissues and lung cancer cells were examined by p120-catenin immunofluorescence, Western blot, and reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Clear and continuous red fluorescence of p120-catenin is displayed at the cell membrane of corresponding normal bronchial epithelial cells, but not in lung cancer tissues that show reduction or absence of membrane expression of p120-catenin or cytoplasmic accumulation of p120-catenin. Compared with corresponding normal lung tissues, lung cancer tissues have significantly lower levels of p120-catenin proteins (P<0.001) and mRNA (P<0.001). The isoforms 1 (120 kD) and 3 (100 kD) proteins were major isoforms of p120-catenin expressed in normal lung tissues, which were significantly reduced in lung cancer samples (P=0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). The mRNA of p120-catenin isoforms 1.2, 1.3, 2.3, 3.1 and 3.3 was detected in corresponding normal lung tissues, but was significantly absent in lung cancer samples (P<0.001 and P=0.001, respectively). Furthermore, p120-catenin isoform 1 is negatively associated - whereas p120-catenin isoform 3 is positively associated - with lymph node metastasis. We conclude that reductions of isoforms 1 and 3 may play different roles in metastatic progression of human lung cancer. \u00a9 Apmis 2007.",

        "abstract": "Background and objective: TCF-4 is an important downstream molecule of Wnt signaling pathway, hut studies on the expression level and significance of TCF-4 in lung cancer were still limited. The aim of this study is to examine the expression level of TCF-4 in lung cancer tissues and cell lines, and analyze its relationship with clinicopathologic characteristics and biological behavior of lung cancers. Methods: TCF-4 expression was examined in 120 lung cancer specimens and 10 corresponding normal lung specimens using immunohistochemistry (S-P method). Immunofluorescence was used to examine the TCF-4 protein expression level and subcellular localization in lung cancer cells and HBE (human normal bronchi epithelium) cells. Expression levels of TCF-4 mRNA were examined using transoription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 9 lung cancer cell lines. Results: Among 120 lung cancer specimens, 96 samples showed high expression of TCF-4 (80.0%), including 37 samples showed TCF-4 expression both in cytoplasm and nuclei (30.8%),TCF-4 were not detected in 10 corresponding normal lung specimens. TCF-4 expression level was positively correlated with TNM stages (P=0.022). The fluorescence signal of TCF-4 protein was conspicuous in lung cancer cells, primarily in cell nuclei, but extremely low in HBE. TCF-4 mRNA expression levels were incompatible in different histology types, the expression level of TCF-4 was relatively high in giant cell carcinoma cells, but low in lung adencarcinoma cells. Conclusion: High expression of TCF-4 positively correlated with lung cancer progression.",

This paper explains how the control network works and describes the negative influence of attacking physical process. The paper proposes denial-of-service (DoS) attacks model and integrity attacks for the control system. In addition, our work focus on analyzing triethylene glycol (TEG) dehydration process flow for discovering the influencing factors, operational constraints and safety constraints in the dehydration process. Then, we evaluate physical and economic influences for DoS attacks and integrity attacks on TEG dehydration process in our physical testbed. The consequence shows that these kinds of attacks scenarios will drive the plant into an unsafe state.

        "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative joint disease\u00a0and\u00a0results from progressive loss and destruction of articular cartilage and the underlying bone. The disease affects millions of people worldwide with an associated risk of mobility disability. However, the molecular basis underlying OA initiation and progression is not well understood and, currently, there is no effective intervention available to decelerate disease progression or restore degraded cartilage. We have found that lncRNA long intergenic nonprotein coding RNA 341 (LINC00341) is aberrantly downregulated in OA patient tissues and cultured OA chondrocytes. This is likely responsible for the increased apoptosis of chondrocytes and pathological destruction of cartilage. Further investigation has revealed that LINC00341 interacts with miR-141 to suppress its functional binding to the 3'-untranslated region of YY1-associated factor 2 (YAF2) messenger RNA. Aberrant downregulation of LINC00341 thus may ultimately lead to inhibition of the YAF2 protein, which has been implicated to be an antiapoptotic factor. Our study has revealed a new noncoding RNA-mediated regulatory network that highly likely protects chondrocytes by preventing apoptosis under normal conditions. The results will help further explore the molecular details pertaining to the progression of OA and stimulate efforts to develop effective therapies.",

This paper proposes a novel business intelligence (BI) approach (namely, the two-step estimation approach, TEA) to estimating CPs with a two-step procedure: one is to introduce partial belongings of consumers to the latent classes with both positive and negative preferences (tastes); the other step is to generate CPs based on the degrees of partial belongings in a weighted probability manner. Experiment results from different online shopping scenarios reveal that TEA is effective and outperforms the traditional latent class model.",

Our study is then aimed at identifying the characteristics of emerging mobile technologies and applications as well as the typical attributes of tasks in modern mobile business environments, and further exploring the corresponding fit between task attributes and technology characteristics. An initial framework for linking task attributes with technology characteristics is proposed based on existing literature, and a field case study with regard to mobile applications in municipal administration in Beijing, China, is presented to tentatively validate and improve the framework. This exploratory study postulates a conceptual model which reflects the pair-wise links between five types of task attributes and five dimensions of mobile technology characteristics. Drawing upon the findings, we also present our further research plan for empirically testing the task-technology fit model for mobile applications that we have formulated, using more quantitative methods.",

One of the research questions is to determine how much information to search (i.e., when to stop searching), since extensive literature on behavior science has revealed that consumers often search either \"too little\" or \"too much\", even with the help of existing interactive online decision aids (IODAs). In order to address this issue, this paper introduces a new approach to IODAs with effective estimation of the incremental search benefits. In doing so, the approach incorporates two important aspects into consideration, namely point estimation and distribution estimation, so as to make use of the relevant information by combining both current and historical facts in reflecting the behavioral patterns of the consumers in search. Moreover, experiments based on data provided by Netflix illustrate that the proposed approach is effective and advantageous over existing ones. \u00a9 (2011) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Classification has been one of the focal points in data mining research and applications. With an effective approach to building compact and accurate associative classification (namely GARC - Gain-based Association Rule Classification (Chen, Liu, Yu, Wei, & Zhang, 2006)) in forms of association rules, this chapter explores a way of fuzzy extension to GARC in dealing with the problem caused by crisp partitions for continuous attribute domains in data. Concretely, the sharp boundaries of the partitioned intervals are smoothened using fuzzy sets (or often conveniently labeled in linguistic terms) so as to reflect a variety of fuzziness on the domains (parameterized in f2), giving rise to a fuzzy associative classifier (i.e., GARC f2). Furthermore, due to the fuzziness involved, the notions of information gain, rule redundancy and conflicts are extended, aimed at providing the desirable features of GARC in the fuzzy extension context for accuracy and compactness. Moreover, data experiments on benchmarking datasets as well as a real-world application illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy associative classifier. \u00a9 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

With the exponential growth of mobile e-commerce, consumers often search for products and services that are closely relevant to the current context such as location and time. This paper studies the search behaviors of mobile consumers, which reflect their customized purchase intentions. In light of machine learning, a probabilistic generative model is proposed to discover underlying search patterns, i.e., when to search,where to search and in what category. Furthermore, the predicting power of the proposed model is validated on the dataset released by Alibaba, the biggest e-commerce platform in the world. Experimental results show the advantages of the proposed model over the classical content-based methods, and also illustrate the effectiveness of integrating contextual factors into modeling consumers search patterns.",

Differently from existing explorations at the overall market level, this paper investigates associative patterns that link search volume changes and stock price movements at individual stock level, so as to be able to support the design of flexible trading strategies. In doing so, a method (namely EATAP SP ) is introduced as an extension to temporal associative pattern mining for time-series data, which can effectively discover the association between search volumes and stock prices in a temporal logic manner with the \u201cafter\u201d predicate. Furthermore, the real world data on all Chinau0027s A-share stocks from Shanghai Stock Exchange is used to test the method, revealing the effectiveness of the method. Moreover, with the discovered patterns, a new stock trading strategy (i.e., EATAP SP -Trading) is designed, which obtains superior cumulative returns and significantly outperforms other strategies.",

This paper proposes a multi-view model, namely, Deep Multi-view Information iNtEgration (Deep-MINE), to take multiple sources of content (i.e., product images, descriptions and review texts) into account and design an end-to-end recommendation model.

        "abstract": "Complements and substitutes are two typical product relationships that deserve consideration in online product recommendation. One of the key objectives of recommender systems is to promote cross-selling, which heavily relies on recommending the appropriate type of products in specific scenarios. Research on consumer behavior has shown that consumers usually prefer substitutes in the browsing stage whereas complements in the purchasing stage. Thus, it is of great importance to identify the complementary and substitutable relationships between products. In this article, we design a neural network based framework that integrates the textual content and non-textual information of online reviews to mine product relationships. For the textual content, we utilize methods such as LDA topic modeling to represent products in a succinct form called \u201cembedding.\u201d To capture the semantics of complementary and substitutable relationships, we design a modeling process that transfers the product embeddings into semantic features and incorporates additional non-textual factors of product reviews. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed product relationship mining model. The advantages and robustness of our model are discussed from various perspectives.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Association rule mining is one of the most important fields in data mining and knowledge discovery in databases. Rules explosion is a problem of concern, as conventional mining algorithms often produce too many rules for decision makers to digest. Instead, this paper concentrates on a smaller set of rules, namely, a set of simple association rules each with its consequent containing only a single attribute. Such a rule set can be used to derive all other association rules, meaning that the original rule set based on conventional algorithms can be 'recovered' from the simple rules without any information loss. The number of simple rules is much less than the number of all rules. Moreover, corresponding algorithms are developed such that certain forms of rules (e.g. 'P\u21d2?' or '?\u21d2Q') can be generated in a more efficient manner based on simple rules.",

This paper presents a new approach for constructing a classifier, based on an extended association rule mining technique in the context of classification. The characteristic of this approach is threefold: first, applying the information gain measure to the generation of candidate itemsets; second, integrating the process of frequent itemsets generation with the process of rule generation; third, incorporating strategies for avoiding rule redundancy and conflicts into the mining process. The corresponding mining algorithm proposed, namely GARC (Gain based Association Rule Classification), produces a classifier with satisfactory classification accuracy, compared with other classifiers (e.g., C4.5, CBA, SVM, NN). Moreover, in terms of association rule based classification, GARC could filter out many candidate itemsets in the generation process, resulting in a much smaller set of rules than that of CBA.",

        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a rise of social publishing, which is a new type of social networking service. Social publishing has certain new features that call for a new way of managing and providing a large volume of documents. A fine data model is expected to evolve dynamically with the up-to-date knowledge, especially the associations that emerge in the context of social publishing. This paper first presents a conceptual schema of social publishing, which evolves to combine the association knowledge that reflects hidden associations in the data. A major constraint of concern is cardinality constraint. During the process of enriching a schema, the constraints to be specified should conform to the existing ones. A set of inference rules is presented for modeling with cardinality constraints. The rules are proven to be sound and complete, which helps to derive cardinality constraints from existing ones. The derived cardinality constraints are also proven to be consistent. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Extending classical association rule mining approaches in consideration of time in order to obtain temporal information/knowledge is deemed important for decision support, which is nowadays one of the key issues in business intelligence. This paper presents the notion of multi-temporal patterns with four different temporal predicates, namely before, during, equal and overlap, and discusses a number of related properties, based on which a mining algorithm is designed. This enables us to effectively discover multi-temporal patterns in large-scale temporal databases by reducing the database scan in the generation of candidate patterns. The proposed approach is then applied to stock markets, aimed at exploring possible associative movements between the stock markets of Chinese mainland and Hong Kong so as to provide helpful knowledge for investment decisions.",

        "abstract": "Today's widespread web applications bring many challenges to decision support systems (DSS) research for effectively retrieving useful information from online data sources that are of huge volume. Importantly, in a web search and service environment, search results grouping becomes a crucial issue of DSS functionality and service, where the scale of data is dynamically expanding. This paper proposes an intelligent method that generates equivalence groups (classes) in an incremental manner, so as to deal with the evolving nature of the data in web search. Such equivalence groups are derived from @l-cuts of transitive closure of a closeness matrix for the search elements. The proposed incremental method does not need to redo the whole procedure of grouping each time when the overall search outcome changes, which is common in real applications, rather, it only captures the changes and related elements so that the calculation is minimized in both time and space complexity. Theoretical analysis and data experiments show the advantage and effectiveness of the proposed incremental method.",

One of essential outcomes of our theory is high understandability of the found associations because when formulated in natural language they are much closer to the way of thinking of experts from various fields.

        "abstract": "Associative classification has aroused significant research attention in recent years due to its advantage in rule forms with satisfactory accuracy. However, the rules in associative classifiers derived from typical association rule mining (e.g., Apriori-type) may easily become too many to be understood and even be sometimes redundant or conflicting. To deal with these issues of concern, a recently proposed approach (i.e., GARC) appears to be superior to other existing approaches (e.g., C4.5-type, NN, SVM, CBA) in two respects: one is its classification accuracy that is equally satisfactory; the other is the compactness that the generated classifier is constituted with much fewer rules. Along with this line of methodological thinking, this paper presents a novel GARC-type approach, namely GEAR, to build an associative classifier with three distinctive and desirable features. First, the rules in the GEAR classifier are more intuitively appealing; second, the GEAR classification accuracy is improved or at least as good as others; and third, the GEAR classifier is significantly more compact in size. In doing so, a number of notions including rule redundancy and compact set are provided, together with related properties that could be incorporated into the rule mining process as algorithmic pruning strategies. The experimental results with benchmarking datasets also reveal that GEAR outperforms GARC and other approaches in an effective manner.",

Review topic based recommendation aims at inferring users ratings over their unrated items using existing reviews and corresponding ratings.

In this regard, this paper proposes a new model to incorporate interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) with review topic based recommendation. Type-2 fuzzy membership functions (T2 MFs) are introduced to represent the topic parameter uncertainties. Then, a strategy of dual sampling is developed to deal with the topic T2 MFs and further used for the uncertainty handling.

First, this paper proposes the CovC+S-Select algorithm, which possesses the characteristic of asymptotic optimality, to optimize information coverage by applying the strategy of simulated annealing. Then to accelerate the speed of CovC+S-Select algorithm, its fast approximation called FastCovC+S-Select has been introduced by utilizing the properties of information coverage.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Providing appropriate online review ranking consistently with the entire review set is deemed important for e-commerce services to facilitate consumers decision making. Unlike the existing efforts that often treat online reviews statically, this paper takes the temporal dynamics of online reviews into account, and designs an effective method for time-aware review ranking. In doing so, first of all, a time-aware review consistency ranking (TRCR) problem is formulated, based on a newly defined metric, which aims to derive a compact review list with maximized expected consistency degree to the original review set. Furthermore, this problem is proven to be NP-hard, which leads us to developing an effective approximation by heuristically restricting the search space (i.e., TRCR ea ). This proposed method with related improvements show strengths on two aspects: one is that the informational decay of the reviews is well addressed at both macro and micro levels; and the other is that the compact review list provided to the consumers is obtained from a combined perspective of consistency and time-awareness in light of product features and sentiment orientations. Finally, the experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method over baseline methods.",

        "abstract": "Functional dependency (FD) is an important type of semantic knowledge reflecting integrity constraints in databases. Traditionally,\n FDs are proposed by managers or domain experts, which is regarded as a logic-driven method. FD has nowadays attracted an increasing\n amount of research attention in data mining and many efforts have been made to discover FDs in large-scale databases automatically.\n In mining FDs, two major problems exist. First, imprecise or noisy data may often exist in massive databases which will lead\n to missing precise FDs. Second, how to efficiently discover the so-called minimal set of FDs is still a hot issue. In order\n to tolerate partial truth due to imprecise or incomplete data, or due to a very tiny insignificance of tuple differences in\n a huge volume of data, the notion of functional dependency with degree of satisfaction, denoted as (FD)\n d\n , has been proposed in [32], along with Armstrong-like properties and the concept of minimal set. Moreover, the efficient\n mining algorithm MFDD has been proposed in [29, 30, 33], by which some inference rules could be used to improve efficiency\n in mining process and the minimal set of satisfied (FD)\n d\n  could be discovered. Based on the MFDD algorithm, this paper will further propose the concept of degree of diversity of attribute,\n which will be proved consistent to the framework of degree of satisfaction. Moreover, some important properties along with\n some optimization strategies will be presented. Furthermore, by measuring the degree of diversities of attributes with pre-scanning\n operation, quite many (FD)\n d\n  could be determined satisfied or dissatisfied using the strategies. This process could highly save the computational consumption\n for further scanning databases in MFDD algorithm, which could effectively improve the efficiency of the whole mining algorithm.\n Furthermore, the experimental results show the optimization strategies could take significant effects to improve the computational\n efficiency. Finally, some concluding remarks and future works will be presented.\n ",

Traditionally, FD is defined in the light of precise or complete data, and can hardly tolerate partial truth due to imprecise or incomplete data (such as noises, nulls, etc.) that may often exist in massive databases, or due to a very tiny insignificance of tuple differences in a huge volume of data. Based on the notion of functional dependencies with degrees of satisfaction (FDs)d, this article presents an efficient approach to discovering all satisfied (FDs)d using some important results obtained from exploration of (FDs)d properties such as extended Armstrong-like axioms and their derivatives. In this way, many dependencies can be inferred from previously discovered ones without scanning databases, and those unsatisfied ones could be filtered out inside (rather than after) the mining process. Fuzzy relation matrix operation is used to infer transitive dependencies in the mining algorithm. Finally, the efficiency is demonstrated with data experiments. \u00a9 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This paper focuses on discovering (FDd)s as a form of useful semantic knowledge, aiming at providing an enhancement to the FD d mining process in a more efficient manner. In doing so, properties of FDd are in-depth investigated along with a measure for degree of distinctness. Subsequently, a number of optimization strategies are developed for pre-processing, which are then incorporated into the mining process, giving rise to an enhanced approach for mining functional dependency with degree of satisfaction, namely e-MFDD.

This makes the traditional scanner based on the signature difficult to detect it. Combing normalization with traditional scanner is a promising direction to solve the problem. The idea is: firstly transform the code into canonical form then pass it into scanner to check. This paper proposes a novel normalization method towards instruction substitution which is a commonly used metamorphism approach. The method mainly involves two steps. Firstly, the input code is rewritten with standard instructions. Secondly, the order of standard instructions is adjusted based on the data dependence graph of each basic block.

In order to achieve high-coverage security testing of these function paths, a new testing method using symbolic testing is proposed in this paper. With the automatic detection of Dispatch routine, symbolic testing is used to analyse the Dispatch function, walk through all supported function paths and get all DeviceIoControlCodes and check constraints. More specific test cases are generated with the guide of the codes and constraints. To compare the coverage of function paths, drivers of six famous security software are tested. Traditional testing method performs an average of 35% coverage, while ours performs 90%. Our tool discovers a previously-undiscovered priviledge escalation vulnerability of BitDefender2012 and some denial-of-service vulnerabilities, which prove the validity of our method.",

However, traditional black box fuzz testing tools, which randomly mutate the input, are blind and ineffective. The white box fuzzing technology, known as the symbolic execution, is still facing the problem of low efficiency and path explosion. We present a new automated fuzzing technique based on comprehensive evaluation and a tool, Rank Fuzz, that implements this technique. By running dynamic taint analysis, we divide the input into several fields and make a rank to each of them according to the comprehensive evaluation results, in the hope that the potential vulnerability can be quickly found. We use several existing vulnerabilities to assess the reasonability of our evaluation system, finding that Rank Fuzz can effectively locate the bytes triggering the vulnerabilities and all of their ranks are on the top 30% of total fields. We also test two off-the-shelf applications within 8 hours and find 3 new vulnerabilities.",

        "abstract": "Fuzzing is an effective technique to discover vulnerabilities that involves testing applications by constructing invalid input data. However, for applications with checksum mechanism, fuzzing can only achieve low coverage because samples generated by the fuzzer are possibly incapable of passing the checksum verification. To solve this problem, most current fuzzers advise the user to comment out the checksum verification code manually, but it requires considerable time to audit the source code to identify the checksum point corresponding to checksum verification. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on taint analysis to identify the checksum point automatically. To implement this approach, the checksum-aware fuzzing assistant tool (CAFA) is designed. After the checksum point is identified, the application is statically patched in an antilogical manner at the checksum point. The fuzzing tool then tests the patched program to bypass the checksum verification. To evaluate CAFA, we use it to assist the American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) tool in fuzzing eight real-world applications with known input specification. The experimental results show that CAFA can accurately and quickly identify the checksum points and greatly improve the coverage of AFL. With the help of CAFA, multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities have been discovered in the newest ImageMagick and RAR applications.",

        "abstract": "Coverage-guided graybox fuzzing is one of the most popular and effective techniques for discovering vulnerabilities due to its nature of high speed and scalability. However, the existing techniques generally focus on code coverage but not on vulnerable code. These techniques aim to cover as many paths as possible rather than to explore paths that are more likely to be vulnerable. When selecting the seeds to test, the existing fuzzers usually treat all seed inputs equally, ignoring the fact that paths exercised by different seed inputs are not equally vulnerable. This results in wasting time testing uninteresting paths rather than vulnerable paths, thus reducing the efficiency of vulnerability detection. In this paper, we present a solution, NeuFuzz, using the deep neural network to guide intelligent seed selection during graybox fuzzing to alleviate the aforementioned limitation. In particular, the deep neural network is used to learn the hidden vulnerability pattern from a large number of vulnerable and clean program paths to train a prediction model to classify whether paths are vulnerable. The fuzzer then prioritizes seed inputs that are capable of covering the likely to be vulnerable paths and assigns more mutation energy (i.e., the number of inputs to be generated) to these seeds. We implemented a prototype of NeuFuzz based on an existing fuzzer PTfuzz and evaluated it on two different test suites: LAVA-M and nine real-world applications. The experimental results showed that NeuFuzz can find more vulnerabilities than the existing fuzzers in less time. We have found 28 new security bugs in these applications, 21 of which have been assigned as CVE IDs.",

The results showed that the addition of collagen couldn't change the component of the coating, but it might improve the toughness of the coating; the crystallinity of the coating was enhanced by the heat treatment and TiO 2 layer was formed between the coating and the substrate; ultrasonic vibration experiments exhibited that the bonding strength between the coating and substrate after heat treatment was increased and the dissolution rate of the coating after heat treatment in physiological salt solution was slowed.",

Quantitative analysis of volume fractions and mean particle volumes of the ceramic phase was adopted to further discuss the reaction between Ti and HA. CaO and Ti x P y were produced in the Ti-HA reaction.

The properties of the assembled forms of the CuS nanosheets are determined by using the concentration of H 2 SO 4  employed in the dealloying process. Spherical clusters composed of CuS nanosheets were fabricated by this process. These clusters have the highest specific surface areas provided by the nanosheets and exhibit high electrochemical and charge storage-release performances. The CuS spherical clusters showed a high specific capacitance of \u223c276\u00a0F\u00a0g \u22121  (at a scan rate of 5\u00a0mV\u00a0s \u22121  in cyclic voltammetry tests) and \u223c713\u00a0F\u00a0g \u22121  (at a charge-discharge current of 1.0\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121 ). The high pseudocapacitive performance can be attributed to the highest specific surface area in our case and absence of volume change of the nanosheets. These results suggest the importance of a rational nanostructure design for high-performance energy applications.",

The black silicon can be produced by a complex laser ablation process both temporally and spatially. In this study, in order to explore the formation mechanism of the silicon microcolumn, the ablation area morphology was analyzed four times for 2min, 5min,10min and 20min and the analysis was induced by a 1064\u00a0nm nanosecond-pulsed laser in 10\u22121 Pa of ambient pressure. The experimental results indicated that the black silicon microcolumns were formed through irradiation accumulation, not instantly and stood neatly at the spot center. With the energy coupling, an increased amount of silicon became vapor and was re-deposited back onto the surface.",

The mathematical model of the actuator is established based on the analysis of displacement mechanism.

A low frequency sine reference signal with the amplitude of 30\u03bcm is applied to the control system to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

But the displacement error is conducted for the inherent hysteretic nonlinear characteristics, and the tracking precision is limited. A modified modeling method combining the neural network with the genetic algorithm (GA) is designed in this paper to improve the modeling performance. The mechanical structure is analyzed, and a Bouc-Wen model is introduced to express the nonlinear kinetics. A three-layer neural network is applied to identify the parameters including the weight and threshold values by Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.

A low frequency triangle voltage with variable amplitude is applied to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Because the dynamic positioning accuracy of piezopositioning stage is affected primarily by dynamic property and hysteresis property of the stage, this paper proposes a dynamic hysteresis model of piezopositioning stage after introducing two kinds of typical property models and their applicable scopes. Furthermore, the parameter identification method of the dynamic hysteresis model constituting of Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) hysteresis operator is given. Experimental studies on the TRITOR100 piezopositioning stage indicate that the dynamic hysteresis model is more accurate than both the linear dynamic model and PI hysteresis model when the stage positioning is dynamically positioned at high speed in \u00b1900 V/s input voltage within 30 \u03bcm positioning range. The mean error of the dynamic hysteresis model is 0.16 \u03bcm, and the maximum error is 0.38 \u03bcm, which provides foundations for designing high performance control system of piezopositioning stage.",

Accurate tracking is difficult to be achieved owing to the intrinsic nonlinear hysteresis of piezoelectric ceramics.

        "abstract": "The erythrocyte-exchanged chimera mouse model has become to be a significant tool for studying animal and human (hu) protozoan haemoparasites, though the usefulness of this model varies depending primarily on the acceptability of xenogeneic red blood cells (RBC). To find a superior recipient in comparison with C.B-17/Jcl mouse with severe combined immuno-deficiency (scid) mutation, we examined in this report the non-obese diabetes (NOD)/shi-scid mouse, a recently available strain of SCID. When 2.5 x 10(8) of fluorescent dye-labeled hu-RBCs were transfused, C.B-17scid mouse eliminated them logarithmically by a simple linear regression, while NOD-scid mouse eradicated hu-RBCs by a unique two-step fashion, i.e., a potent but only briefly functioning RBC eradication followed by a weak steadily functioning step. The means of regression line constance +/- their standard deviations (SD) of 205 C.B-17scid and of 213 NOD-scid mice for their short- and long-lasting steps were -0.73 +/- 0.63, -0.53 +/- 0.25 and -0.16 +/- 0.10, respectively. Hu-RBC half-lives determined from these means of C.B-17scid mice and of NOD-scid mice for the short- and long-living steps were 3.6, 4.9 and 16.3 hr, respectively. Higher hu-RBC acceptability of NOD-scid mouse, especially at their long-lasting step, was also demonstrated under at an activated state of mouse innate immunity. Treatment with 1.0 mg heat-killed Candida cells caused an acceleration of hu-RBC elimination in both mouse strains but the magnitudes for the short- and long-living steps of NOD-scid mice evaluated by \"stimulation index\" were only 1/2.6 and 1/7.6 of C.B-17scid mice, respectively.",

In this study, we surveyed small wild mammals collected at various places in the northern part of Japan, seeking for U.S.-type B. microti. A total of 197 small mammals comprising 10 species, Apodemus speciosus, A. argenteus, Clethrionomys rufocanus, C. rutilus, Eothenomys andersoni, Microtus montebelli, Tamias sibiricus, Sorex unguiculatus, S. caecutiens, and Urotrichus talpoides, were examined. Babesia parasites were detected in A. speciosus, C. rufocanus, C. rutilus, M. montebelli, S. unguiculatus, and S. caecutiens by microscopy of blood smears and by PCR targeting babesial nuclear small-subunit rRNA (rDNA) and beta-tubulin genes. Inoculation of their bloods into experimental animals gave rise to 23 parasite isolates, which included 16 from A. speciosus, 4 from C. rufocanus, and 1 each from C. rutilus, M. montebelli and S. unguiculatus. Sequencing analyses of their rDNA and beta-tubulin genes revealed that, of the 23 isolates, 20 and 3 were of Hobetsu and U.S. types, respectively. The U.S.-type B. microti strains isolated in Japan, however, were distinguishable from the isolates in the United States when their beta-tubulin gene sequences and antigen profiles in Western blots were compared. We conclude that U.S.-type B. microti exists in Japan although it has been genetically and antigenically diversified from that distributed in the United States. The results also suggest that not only rodents, but also some insectivores may serve as reservoirs for the agent of human babesiosis.",

To determine whether these new types of parasites are distributed in places surrounding Japan, an epizootiologic survey was undertaken in three geographically distant areas in northeastern Eurasia; South Korea, Vladivostok in Russia, and Xinjiang in China. Blood samples were collected from a total of 387 animals comprising 24 species. DNAs extracted from the samples were tested by nested PCR targeting babesial nuclear small-subunit rRNA gene (rDNA), which revealed that small rodents harboring B. microti exist in all three survey areas. Sequence analysis showed that all PCR-positive samples had rDNA sequences virtually identical to that of U.S.-type B. microti. However, when beta-tubulin gene sequences were compared, evident geographic variations were seen. By use of primers specific for each of the beta-tubulin genes of Kobe-, Hobetsu-, and U.S.-type parasites, a type-specific PCR was developed. Parasite with Hobetsu- or Kobe-type sequence was not detected from any of the three survey areas. These findings suggest that U.S.-type B. microti is widely distributed among small wild mammals in temperate zones of not only North America, but also Eurasia, whereas that Hobetsu- and Kobe-type parasites may be uniquely distributed in Japan.",

Eighteen sera (1.3%) were found to be IFAT-positive (titer 1:100-1:6,400), of which 14 and three were ascertained by Western blot analysis to be positive against the Hobetsu and Kobe types, respectively. In addition, four sera showed an IFAT titer of 1:100 against the U.S. type, but they appeared to be false-positive because they were cross-reactive against the Hobetsu and Kobe types, and also because a U.S.-type parasite has not been found in Japan. Our results suggest that human babesiosis in Japan occurred prior to the discovery of the index case in 1999 and that the infections were caused mainly by Hobetsu-type parasites.",

        "abstract": "To determine the source of infection for the Japanese index case of human babesiosis, we analyzed blood samples from an asymptomatic individual whose blood had been transfused into the patient. In addition, we surveyed rodents collected from near the donor's residence. Examination by microscopy and PCR failed to detect the parasite in the donor's blood obtained 8 months after the donation of the blood that was transfused. However, we were able to isolate Babesia parasites by inoculating the blood sample into SCID mice whose circulating red blood cells (RBCs) had been replaced with human RBCs. A Babesia parasite capable of propagating in human RBCs was also isolated from a field mouse (Apodemus speciosus) captured near the donor's residential area. Follow-up surveys over a 1-year period revealed that the donor continued to be asymptomatic but had consistently high immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers in serum and low levels of parasitemia which were microscopically undetectable yet which were repeatedly demonstrable by inoculation into animals. The index case patient's sera contained high titers of IgM and, subsequently, rising titers of IgG antibodies, both of which gradually diminished with the disappearance of the parasitemia. Analysis of the parasite's rRNA gene (rDNA) sequence and immunodominant antigens revealed the similarity between donor and patient isolates. The rodent isolate also had an rDNA sequence that was identical to that of the human isolates but that differed slightly from that of the human isolates by Western blot analysis. We conclude that the index case patient acquired infection by transfusion from a donor who became infected in Japan, that parasitemia in an asymptomatic carrier can persist for more than a year, and that A. speciosus serves as a reservoir of an agent of human babesiosis in Japan.",

        "abstract": "We have carried out epizootiologic surveys at various sites in Japan to investigate wild animals that serve as reservoirs for the agents of human babesiosis in the country. Small mammals comprising six species, Apodemus speciosus, Apodemus argenteus, Clethrionomys rufocanus, Eothenomys smithii, Crocidura dsinezumi, and Sorex unguiculatus, were trapped at various places, including Hokkaido, Chiba, Shiga, Hyogo, Shimane, and Tokushima Prefectures. Animals harboring Babesia microti-like parasites were detected in all six prefectures. Inoculation of their blood samples into hamsters gave rise to a total of 20 parasite isolates; 19 were from A. speciosus, and the other 1 was from C. rufocanus. Sequencing of the parasite small-subunit rRNA gene (rDNA) sequence revealed that 2 of the 20 isolates were classified as Kobe type because their rDNAs were identical to that of the Kobe strain (the strain from the Japanese index case). The other 18 isolates were classified as a new type, designated the Hobetsu type, because they all shared an identical rDNA sequence which differed significantly from both that of Kobe-type isolates and that of northeastern United States B. microti (U.S. type). The parasites with Kobe-, Hobetsu- and U.S.-type rDNAs were phylogenetically closely related to each other but clearly different from each other antigenically. The isolates from rodents were demonstrated to be infective for human erythrocytes by inoculation into SCID mice whose erythrocytes had been replaced with human erythrocytes. The results suggest that a new type of B. microti-like parasite, namely, the Hobetsu type, is the major one which is prevalent among Japanese wild rodents, that A. speciosus serves as a major reservoir for both Kobe- and Hobetsu-type B. microti-like parasites, and that C. rufocanus may also be an additional reservoir on Hokkaido Island.",

        "abstract": "We have isolated piroplasms from a patient who developed the first case of human babesiosis in Japan by using NOD/shi-scid mice whose circulating erythrocytes (RBCs) had been replaced with human RBCs (hu-RBC-SCID mice). Following inoculation of the patient's blood specimen into hu-RBC-SCID mice, parasites proliferated within the human RBCs in the mice, resulting in a high level of parasitemia. Parasite DNA was prepared from blood samples of the patient and the mice, and the nuclear small-subunit rRNA gene (rDNA) was amplified and sequenced. Both DNA samples gave rise to identical sequences which showed the highest degree of homology (99.2%) with the Babesia microti rDNA. Because the patient had received a blood transfusion before the onset of babesiosis, we investigated the eight donors who were involved. Their archived blood samples were analyzed for specific antibody and parasite DNA; only a single donor was found to be positive by both tests, and the parasite rDNA sequence from the donor coincided with that derived from the patient. The donor's serum exhibited a high antibody titer against the isolate from the patient, whereas it exhibited only a weak cross-reaction against B. microti strains isolated in the United States. We conclude that the first Japanese babesiosis case occurred due to a blood transfusion and that the etiological agent is an indigenous Japanese parasite which may be a geographical variant of B. microti. Our results also demonstrated the usefulness of hu-RBC-SCID mice for isolation of parasites from humans and for maintenance of the parasite infectivity for human RBCs.",

The mass ratio of BiVO4/BiPO4 was then varied from 3 wt% to 50 wt% and the optimum value was found to be 30 wt%, showing 8.3-fold and 6.3-fold apparent reaction rates higher than those of pristine BiPO4 and BiVO4, respectively. Moreover, all of the reduced Rh B was transformed into CO2 and H2O during the photocatalysis, thus showing the good mineralization ability (almost 100%) of the composite. Furthermore, the photocatalytic mechanism of the composite was also investigated here by the zeta potential, scavenger experiments, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), transient photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Results show that (i) \u02d9OH was the main reactive species and (ii) BiVO4 could form a heterojunction with BiPO4, thus widening the response range to the visible region and accelerating the charge separation and transfer.",

When the molar ratio of W/Cr is 10:1, the hexagonal WO 3 -Cr 2 O 3  nanocomposite shows obvious selectivity toward 2-butanone at 205\u00a0\u00b0C compared with other typical reducing gases, and the response value to 100\u00a0ppm 2-butanone can reach 5.6. However, there is no selectivity toward 2-butanone when the Cr/W molar ratio is 1:4 and 1:40. Furthermore, hexagonal WO 3 -Cr 2 O 3  nanocomposites have a short response and recovery time to 5\u00a0ppm 2-butanone, which is 10\u00a0s and 80\u00a0s, respectively. The measured results indicate that hexagonal WO 3 -Cr 2 O 3  nanocomposite is a potential gas sensing material for monitoring volatile organic compounds (VOCs).",

        "abstract": "The highly sensitive detection of butanone was achieved by the WO3 nanosheets-Cr2O3 nanoparticles (denoted as \u201cCr2O3/WO3\u201d) p\u2013n junction nanocomposite which was synthesized via a facile two-step hydrothermal process. The structure, morphology and compositions of the as-synthesized Cr2O3/WO3 nanocomposite were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, HRTEM, XPS, and BET. In the gas sensing test, the response of the Cr2O3/WO3 nanocomposite (Cr/W = 1:40, 1:10) to 100 ppm butanone at 180 \u00b0C can reach to 40.51 and 38.26, respectively, which was much higher than that of independent WO3 nanosheets (10.7). Moreover, the Cr2O3/WO3 nanocomposite sensor shows rapid response (ca. 9 s)/recovery (ca. 15 s) time to 5 ppm butanone. In this work, a possible gas sensing mechanism of Cr2O3/WO3 nanocomposite sensor was also discussed based on p\u2013n junction. The superior gas sensor properties demonstrate that Cr2O3/WO3 nanocomposite is a potential material for monitoring butanone.",

        "abstract": "Abnormalities in epigenetic modifiers are emerging as driving events in prostate cancer (PCa). The histone methyltransferase KMT2D, a frequently aberrant epigenetic modifier in various tumors, has an undefined role in PCa. Moreover, little is known regarding KMT2D's mutation in Chinese patients or its downstream signaling pathways and targets. Here, we profiled the mutational spectrum of 32 significantly PCa-associated genes by using disease-targeted sequencing, and found that KMT2D was highly mutated (63.04%, 29/46) in Chinese patients. Moreover, high KMT2D transcription was also associated with poor prognosis in an independent cohort (n\u2009=\u200951). In KMT2D-knockdown PC-3 and DU145 cells, cell proliferation (P\u2009<\u20090.01), invasion (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and migration (P\u2009<\u20090.01) were consequently suppressed. KMT2D depletion effectively suppressed tumor growth by 92.21% in vivo. Notably, integrative analyses of RNAseq and ChIPseq characterized two crucial genes downregulated by KMT2D, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and Kruppel-like factor-4 (KLF4), which are regulators in PI3K/Akt and EMT, respectively. Our present study revealed that KMT2D epigenetically activates PI3K/Akt pathway and EMT by targeting LIFR and KLF4 and thus serves as a putative epigenetic-based target for treating PCa.",

        "abstract": "The role of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), which is important in the signal transduction of the interleukin-6 cytokine family, is still undefined in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Thus, we examined the function and mechanism of LIFR in ccRCC. Low LIFR expression correlated with a poor prognosis and an aggressive tumor phenotype. Moreover, integrated LIFR DNA and mRNA analysis revealed that promoter methylation and copy number variation contributed to the reduced LIFR expression. LIFR knockdown increased 786-O and Caki-2 cell invasion and migration. Notably, the Hippo pathway was highlighted as a potential downstream target of LIFR, where loss of LIFR inhibited the kinase activity of the pathway and increased the intracellular Yes-associated protein (YAP) level. Conversely, YAP inhibition impaired the LIFR-silencing promotion of cell migration, invasion, and cancer stem cell marker expression. Moreover, drug sensitivity analysis and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database revealed that LIFR-deficient cells had high sensitivity to a YAP inhibitor and to two other anticancer drugs (PHA-665752, PF2341066). Our study revealed that LIFR attenuates tumor metastasis by suppressing YAP expression, suggesting that LIFR may serve as a potential target for ccRCC treatment.",

        "abstract": "Histone methyltransferase KMT2D has diverse functions and distinct mechanisms in different cancers. Although we have previously found KMT2D serves as an oncogene that promotes tumor growth and metastasis in prostate cancer (PCa), the functions and mechanisms of KMT2D are complicated and most remain undefined. Here, the function of KMT2D regarding DNA damage in PCa and the underlying mechanisms of KMT2D in epigenetic regulation were explored in a series of studies. Knockdown of KMT2D sensitized cells to DNA damage through the disturbance of antioxidative gene expression and increased levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species, which led to cell apoptosis and senescence. The loss of KMT2D reduced the abundance of enhancer activity markers H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, which blocked the DNA binding of FOXO3, a critical mediator of the cellular response to oxidative stress, and suppressed antioxidative gene transcription. Moreover, KMT2D deletion in PCa cells also increased their sensitivity to genotoxic anticancer drugs and a PARP inhibitor, which suggested that lower levels of KMT2D may mediate the response of PCa to particular treatments. These findings further highlighted the important role of KMT2D in PCa progression and suggested that targeting KMT2D might be therapeutically beneficial for advanced PCa treatment.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a one-step aqueous self-polymerization strategy to prepare surface molecularly imprinted poly(dopamine) (PDA) film. The method is simple and convenient compared with the \"template-guided\" surface molecularly imprinted synthesis method and the layer-by-layer self-assembly and the surface-grafted molecularly imprinted synthesis methods. The molecularly imprinted PDA films could selectively bind the template molecules (4-Hydroxybenzoic acid as a model), and bisphenol A (BPA) imprinted PDA films were also investigated. Meanwhile, the 2-dimension imprinted film material was used very conveniently. \u00a9 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

After blending with the CPES, the water contact angles (WCAs) of the membranes decreased from about 57.3\u00b0 to 35.0\u00b0. The modified hollow fiber membranes showed significant pH-sensitivity and pH-reversibility; the pH-valve effect was observed at the pH values ranged from 5 to 10. In addition, the fluxes of the blended hollow fiber membranes increased with the increase of the blended CPES amounts. The bovine serum albumin (BSA) adsorbed amounts for the membranes decreased from 17.6\u03bcg/cm2 to 7.6\u03bcg/cm2, and the blended membranes showed good protein antifouling property. The metal ionexchange experiment indicated that the membranes could be used to bind heavy metal ions. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

The grafted IDA was characterized by fourier transform infrared measurement, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis spectra. The adsorbed amounts by the PES-IDA for Cu2+ and Ag+ were 3.44 mg/g and 7.09 mg/g, respectively.

It needs only a simple immersion of substrates in dopamine solution at alkaline pH to form mussel-inspired PDA coating, and then immersing the PDA coated substrates into biomolecule solution to conjugate biomolecules. XPS, water contact angle analysis, and protein assay confirmed that biomolecules could be successfully coated on several material surfaces, including nylon, cellulose, and polyethersulfone membrane surfaces. For the protein fouling resistance, the bovine serum albumin (BSA) modified surfaces were more effective than the amino acid modified surfaces. And the platelet adhesion on the BSA-modified material surfaces was obviously depressed. These results indicated that the blood compatibility of the surfaces was improved by the biomacromolecule-immobilized mussel-inspired coating which might be considered as a universal coating to modify a wide variety of materials.",

        "abstract": "A new method for the functional modification of polyethersulfone (PES) is described in this paper in which PES was sulfonated by chlorosulfonic acid firstly and then chlorinated by phosphorus pentachloride. Thereby, chlorosulfonic groups (-SO2Cl) were introduced in PES successfully, and the degree of the chlorosulfonation was about 15%. Since the chlorosulfonic group is reactive enough towards the amino group (-NH2), the conformation of chlorosulfonic-based covalent bonding functional route could further extend the PES application area with versatile functionality. In this article, hydroxyl (-OH), carboxyl (-COOH), amino (-NH2) and methyl (-CH3) groups were grafted onto a PES matrix through the reaction of chlorosulfonic groups and the amino groups. The functional groups have effects on protein adsorption and cell behavior. The membrane modified with an amino group was in favor of cell adhesion and proliferation, and the membrane modified with hydroxyl and methyl did not so well as the membrane modified with an amino group, which will give guidance for biomaterial modification.",

        "abstract": "Immunization with a killed or inactivated viral vaccine provides significant protection in animals against challenge with certain corresponding pathogenic coronaviruses (CoVs). However, the promise of this approach in humans is hampered by serious concerns over the risk of leaking live severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viruses. In this study, we generated a SARS vaccine candidate by using the live-attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) as a vector. The full-length SARS-CoV envelope Spike (S) glycoprotein gene was introduced into the deletion III region of the MVA genome. The newly generated recombinant MVA, ADS-MVA, is replication incompetent in mammalian cells and highly immunogenic in terms of inducing potent neutralizing antibodies in mice, rabbits, and monkeys. After two intramuscular vaccinations with ADS-MVA alone, the 50% inhibitory concentration in serum was achieved with reciprocal sera dilutions of more than 1,000- to 10,000-fold in these animals. Using fragmented S genes as immunogens, we also mapped a neutralizing epitope in the region of N-terminal 400 to 600 amino acids of the S glycoprotein (S400-600), which overlaps with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor-binding region (RBR; S318-510). Moreover, using a recombinant soluble RBR-Fc protein, we were able to absorb and remove the majority of the neutralizing antibodies despite observing that the full S protein tends to induce a broader spectrum of neutralizing activities in comparison with fragmented S proteins. Our data suggest that a major mechanism for neutralizing SARS-CoV likely occurs through blocking the interaction between virus and the cellular receptor ACE2. In addition, ADS-MVA induced potent immune responses which very likely protected Chinese rhesus monkeys from pathogenic SARS-CoV challenge.",

Potent siRNA inhibitors of SARS coronavirus (SCV) in vitro were further evaluated for efficacy and safety in a rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) SARS model using clinically viable delivery while comparing three dosing regimens. Observations of SARS-like symptoms, measurements of SCV RNA presence and lung histopathology and immunohistochemistry consistently showed siRNA-mediated anti-SARS efficacy by either prophylactic or therapeutic regimens. The siRNAs used provided relief from SCV infection-induced fever, diminished SCV viral levels and reduced acute diffuse alveoli damage. The 10-40 mg/kg accumulated dosages of siRNA did not show any sign of siRNA-induced toxicity. These results suggest that a clinical investigation is warranted and illustrate the prospects for siRNA to enable a massive reduction in development time for new targeted therapeutic agents.",

        "abstract": "Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) utilizes for target cell entry and, therefore, plays an important role in SARS pathogenesis. Since Chinese rhesus (rh) macaques do not usually develop SARS after SARS-CoV infection, it has been suggested that rh-ACE2 probably does not support viral entry efficiently. To determine the role of rh-ACE2 in early lung pathogenesis in vivo, we studied eleven Chinese rhesus monkeys experimentally infected with a pathogenic SARS-CoV(PUMC01) strain. Rh-ACE2 genes were amplified from all animals by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and their function was studied in vitro using a pseudovirus entry assay. Many natural non-synonymous (NS) changes were found in rh-ACE2 genes. Compared to human (hu) ACE2, thirty-eight consensus NS changes were found in rh-ACE2. Since these changes do not interact with the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV, rh-ACE2 in general is as effective as human homolog in supporting viral entry. Rh-ACE2, however, is more polymorphic than hu-ACE2. Additional sporadic NS substitutions in clone Rh11-7 reduced the level of rh-ACE2 protein expression and did not support viral entry effectively. Further mutagenesis analysis showed that a natural mutation Y217N dramatically alters ACE2 expression and entry efficiency. Moreover, introduction of the Y217N mutation into hu-ACE2 caused the down-regulation of expression and reduced viral entry efficiency. These results indicate that the Y217N mutation plays a role in modulating SARS-CoV infection. Our results provide insights for understanding the role of rh-ACE2 in SARS lung pathogenesis in a non-human primate model.",

        "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 is mainly transmitted mucosally during sexual intercourse. We therefore evaluated the protective efficacy of a vaccine active at mucosal sites. Macaca mulatta monkeys were immunized via both the intramuscular and intranasal routes with an HIV-1 vaccine made of gp41-subunit antigens grafted on virosomes, a safe delivery carrier approved in humans with self-adjuvant properties. Six months after 13 vaginal challenges with simian-HIV (SHIV)-SF162P3, four out of five vaccinated animals remained virus-negative, and the fifth was only transiently infected. None of the five animals seroconverted to p27gag-SIV. In contrast, all 6 placebo-vaccinated animals became infected and seroconverted. All protected animals showed gp41-specific vaginal IgAs with HIV-1 transcytosis-blocking properties and vaginal IgGs with neutralizing and/or antibody-dependent cellular-cytotoxicity activities. In contrast, plasma IgGs totally lacked virus-neutralizing activity. The protection observed challenges the paradigm whereby circulating antiviral antibodies are required for protection against HIV-1 infection and may serve in designing a human vaccine against HIV-1-AIDS.",

The results of virus isolation, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization showed that the lung was the major target organ of the H5N1 virus infection. No virus was detected in the extrapulmonary organs. The results of immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization also showed that pneumocytes and macrophages of the lower airway, not the ciliary epithelium of the trachea and bronchi, were the chief target cells in the lung tissue of the infected Chinese rhesus macaque. Our data indicate that the Chinese rhesus macaque is suitable as a new primate model for H5N1 virus research, especially for the study of H5N1 virus transmission. The predilection of the H5N1 virus to infect the lower airway suggests that the failure of the virus to attach to the ciliary epithelium of the trachea and bronchi may be a limiting factor in human-to-human transmissibility of the H5N1 virus.",

However, no information is available about the effects of HIV infection on SERT expression. In this study, a TaqMan real-time RT-PCR method was established, levels of SERT mRNA in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and various tissues from normal Chinese rhesus macaques, in PBMCs from 32 SHIV-sf162p4 infected rhesus macaques and from 8 rhesus macaques before and 7, 14, 21, 28 and 196 days after SHIV-sf162p4 infection, and in PBMCs before and after in vitro phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation were examined. It was found that SERT mRNA was widely distributed in lymphoid tissues; the level of SERT mRNA was significantly reduced in PBMCs from SHIV infected rhesus macaques and in PBMCs stimulated with PHA. The most evident decrease (to about one-tenth) in SERT mRNA level was observed at day 7 after SHIV infection. Difference in PBMC SERT mRNA level between 5-HTTLPR genotypes was not statistically significant. These data indicated that, in addition to previously observed abnormality in serotonin metabolism, SERT expression might be affected in HIV/AIDS, which might be associated with depression and other psychiatric disorders in HIV/AIDS. Besides, this study provided a basis for quantitative analysis of SERT gene expression under effects of host and environmental factors, such as 5-HTTLPR genotypes, SERT targeting drugs or other infectious agents.",

        "abstract": "Newly emerging viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome CoVs (MERS-CoV), and H7N9, cause fatal acute lung injury (ALI) by driving hypercytokinemia and aggressive inflammation through mechanisms that remain elusive. In SARS-CoV/macaque models, we determined that anti-spike IgG (S-IgG), in productively infected lungs, causes severe ALI by skewing inflammation-resolving response. Alveolar macrophages underwent functional polarization in acutely infected macaques, demonstrating simultaneously both proinflammatory and wound-healing characteristics. The presence of S-IgG prior to viral clearance, however, abrogated wound-healing responses and promoted MCP1 and IL-8 production and proinflammatory monocyte/macrophage recruitment and accumulation. Critically, patients who eventually died of SARS (hereafter referred to as deceased patients) displayed similarly accumulated pulmonary proinflammatory, absence of wound-healing macrophages, and faster neutralizing antibody responses. Their sera enhanced SARS-CoV-induced MCP1 and IL-8 production by human monocyte-derived wound-healing macrophages, whereas blockade of Fc\u03b3R reduced such effects. Our findings reveal a mechanism responsible for virus-mediated ALI, define a pathological consequence of viral specific antibody response, and provide a potential target for treatment of SARS-CoV or other virus-mediated lung injury.",

We herein report of evaluating a recombinant receptor-binding domain (rRBD) protein vaccine in a rhesus macaque model.Nine monkeys were randomly assigned to high-dose, low-dose and mock groups,which were immunized with different doses of rRBD plus alum adjuvant or adjuvant alone at different time points (0, 8, 25 weeks). Immunological analysis was conducted after each immunisation. Monkeys were challenged with MERS-CoV at 14 days after the final immunisation followed by observation for clinical signs and chest X-rays. Nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs were also collected for analyses. Monkeys were euthanized 3 days after challenge and multiple specimens from tissues were collected for pathological, virological and immunological tests.Robust and sustained immunological responses (including neutralisation antibody) were elicited by the rRBD vaccination. Besides, rRBD vaccination alleviated pneumonia with evidence of reduced tissue impairment and clinical manifestation in monkeys. Furthermore, the rRBD vaccine decreased viral load of lung, trachea and oropharyngeal swabs of monkeys. These data in NHP paves a way for further development of an effective human vaccine against MERS-CoV infection.",

        "abstract": "The discovery of an emerging viral disease, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV), has prompted the need to understand pathogenesis of SFTSV. We are unique in establishing an infectious model of SFTS in C57/BL6 mice, resulting in hallmark symptoms of thrombocytopenia and leukocytopenia. Viral RNA and histopathological changes were identified in the spleen, liver, and kidney. However, viral replication was only found in the spleen, which suggested the spleen to be the principle target organ of SFTSV. Moreover, the number of macrophages and platelets were largely increased in the spleen, and SFTSV colocalized with platelets in cytoplasm of macrophages in the red pulp of the spleen. In vitro cellular assays further revealed that SFTSV adhered to mouse platelets and facilitated the phagocytosis of platelets by mouse primary macrophages, which in combination with in vivo findings, suggests that SFTSV-induced thrombocytopenia is caused by clearance of circulating virus-bound platelets by splenic macrophages. Thus, this study has elucidated the pathogenic mechanisms of thrombocytopenia in a mouse model resembling human SFTS disease.",

However, the complexity of SeV virion antigen limits the accuracy of the diagnostic method. In the current study, complete SeV virion antigen was separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed, with nucleocapsid protein (NP) showing predominant antigenicity. A peptide array containing overlapping 14-mer peptides covering the entire NP was developed. The array used SeV positive serum and resulted in four antigenic linear peptides being identified, which were located in the carboxyl-terminus of NP. The four peptides were coated on ELISA plates and tested with SeV positive and SeV negative sera, and the antigenicity of three peptides, NP413-428, NP473-490 and NP507-524, was confirmed. Mixture of the three peptides showed comparable sensitivity and better specificity in clinical rat sera ELISA tests compared with complete SeV virion antigen. In conclusion, the three peptides, NP413-428, NP473-490 and NP507-524, would be good candidates as linear antigens for SeV detection.",

Peak virus shedding from respiratory tract was observed on 2 days post inoculation (d.p.i.) for mice and 3-5 d.p.i. for ferrets. Virus could also be detected in brain, liver, spleen, kidney, and intestine from inoculated mice, and in heart, liver, and olfactory bulb from inoculated ferrets. The inoculation of H7N9 could elicit seroconversion titers up to 1280 in ferrets and 160 in mice. Leukopenia, significantly reduced lymphocytes but increased neutrophils were also observed in mouse and ferret models.The mouse and ferret model enables detailed studies of the pathogenesis of this illness and lay the foundation for drug or vaccine evaluation.",

In a ferret model, the pathogenicity of influenza A(H7N9) was found to be less than that of an influenza A(H5N1) strain but comparable to that of 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1), based on the clinical signs, mortality, virus dissemination, and results of histopathologic analyses. Influenza A(H7N9) could replicate in the upper and lower respiratory tract, the heart, the liver, and the olfactory bulb. It is worth noting that influenza A(H7N9) exhibited a low level of transmission between ferrets via respiratory droplets. There were 4 mutations in the virus isolated from the contact ferret: D678Y in the gene encoding PB2, R157K in the gene encoding hemagglutinin (H3 numbering), I109T in the gene encoding nucleoprotein, and T10I in the gene encoding neuraminidase. These data emphasized that avian-origin influenza A(H7N9) can be transmitted between mammals, highlighting its potential for human-to-human transmissibility.",

Skeletal muscles have been thought to be crucial for the pathogenesis of EV71-related diseases. However, little is known about the virulence of mouse muscle-adapted EV71. The EV71 0805 were subjected to four passages in the mouse muscle to generate a mouse-adapted EV71 strain of 0805a. In comparison with the parental EV71 0805, the mouse muscle-adapted EV71 0805a displayed stronger cytotoxicity against Rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells and more efficient replication in RD cells. Furthermore, infection with the EV71 0805a significantly inhibited the gain of body weight, accompanied by increased muscle virus load and multiple tissue distribution in the infected mouse. Histological examinations indicated that infection with the EV71 0805 did not cause obvious pathogenic lesions in mice, while infection with the muscle-adapted 0805a resulted in severe necrotizing myositis in the skeletal and cardio muscles, and intestinitis in mice on day 5 post infection. Further analysis revealed many mutations in different regions of the genome of mouse muscle-adapted virus. Collectively, these data demonstrated the mouse muscle-adapted EV71 0805a with increased virulence in mice.",

        "abstract": "T-20 (enfuvirtide) is the only approved viral fusion inhibitor, which is used for treatment of HIV-1 infection; however, it has relatively low antiviral activity and easily induces drug resistance. We recently reported a T-20-based lipopeptide fusion inhibitor (LP-40) showing improved anti-HIV activity (Ding  J Virol, 2017). In this study, we designed LP-50 and LP-51 by refining the structure and function of LP-40. Two new lipopeptides showed dramatically enhanced secondary structures and binding stability and were exceptionally potent inhibitors of HIV-1, HIV-2, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and simian-human chimeric virus (SHIV), with mean IC values at very low picomolar concentrations. They also exhibited dramatically increased potencies in inhibiting a panel of T-20 and LP-40-resistant mutant viruses. In line with their  data, LP-50 and LP-51 exhibited extremely potent and long-lasting  anti-HIV activities in rhesus monkeys, with serum dilution peaks that inhibited 50% virus infection being >15,200-fold higher than T-20 and LP-40. A low-dose, short-term monotherapy of LP-51 could sharply reduce viral loads to undetectable levels in acutely and chronically SHIV-infected monkey models. In our knowledge, LP-50 and LP-51 are the most potent and broad HIV-1/2 and SIV fusion inhibitors, which can be developed for clinical use and serve as tools to explore the mechanisms of viral entry and inhibition. T-20 remains the only membrane fusion inhibitor available for treatment of viral infection, but its relatively low anti-HIV and genetic barrier for drug resistance have significantly limited its clinical application. Herein, we report two new lipopeptide-based fusion inhibitors (LP-50 and LP-51) showing extremely potent inhibitory activities against diverse HIV-1, HIV-2, SIV, and T-20-resistant variants. Promisingly, both inhibitors exhibited a potent and long-lasting  anti-HIV activity and could efficiently suppress viral loads at undetectable levels in SHIV-infected monkey models. We believe that they are the most potent and broad-spectrum fusion inhibitors known to date and thus have high potential for clinical development.",

        "abstract": "Peptides derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) fusogenic protein gp41 are potent viral entry inhibitors, and currently, enfuvirtide (T-20) is the only one approved for clinical use; however, emerging drug resistance largely limits its efficacy. In this study, we generated a novel lipopeptide inhibitor, named LP-19, by integrating multiple design strategies, including an N-terminal M-T hook structure, an HIV-2 sequence, intrahelical salt bridges, and a membrane-anchoring lipid tail. LP-19 showed stable binding affinity and highly potent, broad, and long-lasting antiviral activity. In  studies, LP-19 efficiently inhibited HIV-1-, HIV-2-, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-mediated cell fusion, viral entry, and infection, and it was highly active against diverse subtypes of primary HIV-1 isolates and inhibitor-resistant mutants.  studies demonstrated that LP-19 exhibited dramatically increased anti-HIV activity and an extended half-life in rhesus macaques. In short-term monotherapy, LP-19 reduced viral loads to undetectable levels in acutely and chronically simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-infected monkeys. Therefore, this study offers an ideal HIV-1/2 fusion inhibitor for clinical development and emphasizes the importance of the viral fusion step as a drug target. The peptide drug T-20 is the only viral fusion inhibitor in the clinic, which is used for combination therapy of HIV-1 infection; however, it requires a high dosage and easily induces drug resistance, calling for a new drug with significantly improved pharmaceutical profiles. Here, we have developed a short-lipopeptide-based fusion inhibitor, termed LP-19, which mainly targets the conserved gp41 pocket site and shows highly potent inhibitory activity against HIV-1, HIV-2, and even SIV isolates. LP-19 exhibits dramatically increased antiviral activity and an extended half-life in rhesus macaques, and it has potent therapeutic efficacy in SHIV-infected monkeys, highlighting its high potential as a new viral fusion inhibitor for clinical use.",

        "abstract": "Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) dramatically improves survival of HIV-infected patients, but lifelong treatment can ultimately result in cumulative toxicities and drug resistance, thus necessitating the development of new drugs with significantly improved pharmaceutical profiles. We recently found that the fusion inhibitor T-20 (enfuvirtide)-based lipopeptides possess dramatically increased anti-HIV activity. Herein, a group of novel lipopeptides were designed with different lengths of fatty acids, identifying a stearic acid-modified lipopeptide (LP-80) with the most potent anti-HIV activity. It inhibited a large panel of divergent HIV subtypes with a mean IC50 in the extremely low picomolar range, being > 5,300-fold more active than T-20 and the neutralizing antibody VRC01. It also sustained the potent activity against T-20-resistant mutants and exhibited very high therapeutic selectivity index. Pharmacokinetics of LP-80 in rats and monkeys verified its potent and long-acting anti-HIV activity. In the monkey, subcutaneous administration of 3 mg/kg LP-80 yielded serum concentrations of 1,147 ng/ml after injection 72 h and 9 ng/ml after injection 168 h (7 days), equivalent to 42,062- and 330-fold higher than the measured IC50 value. In SHIV infected rhesus macaques, a single low-dose LP-80 (3 mg/kg) sharply reduced viral loads to below the limitation of detection, and twice-weekly monotherapy could maintain long-term viral suppression.",

Keywords Stereodynamics QCT Vibrational distribution Cross-section Product rotational alignment 1 Introduction The reaction of O( 3 P ) with H 2 is known to be one of the key reaction in atmospheric chemistry as the production OH radical is a significant partner in ozone depletion mechanism [1] . In addition, the reaction is of major importance in combustion [2,3] and interstellar chemistry [4,5] . Therefore, varieties of potential energy surfaces (PESs) and dynamics calculations [6\u201313] as well as many experimental studies are reported [14\u201316] over the last decade. Being a typical atom-molecule reaction, it is also considered to be the simplest reaction involving oxygen atoms and the prototype system to test the quality of new theories and experiments. For the title reaction, Rogers et al. constructed a potential energy surface (PES) [7] and it is extended by Brand\u00e3o et al., recently, named BMS1 [8] , which provide an improved description of the van der Waals interaction for the lowest 3A\u2033 state. Schatz and co-workers [9] investigated intersystem crossing effects in the title reaction and proposed a general methodology for such systems and performed a quasi-classical trajectory surface hopping (TSH) calculation. Braunstein et al. [10] and Balakrishnan [11] have reported their adiabatic dynamics calculations on the O( 3 P ) + H 2 \u2192 OH + H reaction very recently, and the agreement between these calculated total reaction cross-sections and the experimental results have been found. Han et al. [12,13] presented an exact quantum study of spin\u2013orbit induced intersystem crossing effects in the title reaction for the first time and demonstrated that the spin\u2013orbit coupling between the triplet states of different symmetries has the greatest contribution to the intersystem crossing. Garton et al. [14] presented the first measurements of the relative excitation function for the O( 3 P ) + H 2 performed with the use of a crossed molecular beams apparatus in conjunction with a high-energy (laser detonation) source of O atoms. Owing to this experimental breakthrough and the availability of new ab initio PESs of chemical accuracy, there currently is a renewed theoretical interest in the title reaction. However, most studies in previous work deal basically with the scalar properties. In order to understand the dynamics of the atom-molecule reaction fully, it is important to study not only the scalar properties, but also the vector properties. It has been recognized that the correlated angular distribution describing the mutual orientations of the reagent and product linear and angular momentum provides an informative three-dimensional picture of a chemical reaction. Experimental and theoretical interest in vector correlation in the reaction processes A + BC \u2192 AB + C has increased significantly in recent decades [17\u201324] . To shed light on stereodynamics, in this paper, we will explore the polarization of product rotational angular momentum in the reaction, and the influence of initial vibrational states of the hydrogen molecule on product\u2019s vector correlations. 2 Theory 2.1 Vector correlations among k , k \u2032 and j\u2032 The reagent relative velocity vector k is parallel to the z -axis. The x\u2013z plane is the scattering plane containing the initial and final relative velocity vectors, k and k \u2032. \u03b8 t is the angle between the reagent relative velocity and product relative velocity, namely, scattering angle. The angles \u03b8 r and \u03d5 r are the polar and azimuthal angles of the final rotational momentum j \u2032. The distribution function P ( \u03b8 r ) describing the k \u2013 k \u2032 correlation can be expanded in a series of Legendre polynomials and the dihedral angle distribution function P ( \u03d5 r ) describing the k \u2013 k \u2032\u2013 j \u2032 correlation expanded in a Fourier series [22\u201328] . The full three-dimensional angular distribution associated with k \u2013 k \u2032\u2013 j \u2032 can be represented by a set of generalized polarization dependent differential cross-sections (PDDCSs) in the CM frame that is described in Ref. [26] . 2.2 Potential energy surface and quasi-classical trajectory calculations In our calculations, the BMS1 PES [8] has been employed. The BMS1 PES for the O( 3 P ) + H 2 system in the lowest 3A\u2033 state is the best fit to the ab initio data calculated by Rogers et al. [7] and deepened the van der Waals well at collinear abstraction geometry ( C \u221e v symmetry). The reaction barrier is 13.08 kcal/mol above the O( 3 P ) + H 2 asymptote limit and a van der Waals minimum (\u22120.502 kcal/mol) is found at a collinear reactant configuration ( C \u221e v ) with the O atom at 6.2 a 0 from the H 2 center of mass. The BMS1 PES is also characterized by an abstraction saddle point at R HH = 1.7424 a 0 and R OH = 2.2730 a 0 . The quasi-classical trajectory calculations are standard. The classical Hamilton\u2019s equations are integrated numerically for motion in three dimensions. The initial azimuthal orientation angle and polar angle of the reagent molecule internuclear axis are randomly sampled using Monte Carlo method. In the calculation, the vibrational levels of the reactants molecule are taken as v = 0, 1, 2, j = 0, respectively. Batches of 50,000 trajectories are run for each vibrational state and the integration step size is chosen as 0.1 fs. The trajectories are started at an initial distance of 10 \u00c5 between the O atom and the centre of the mass of the H 2 molecule. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows the cross-sections calculated from the TDQM (solid line) [29] and QCT calculations using the BMS1 surface. As expected, the QCT results are in good agreement with TDQM at high collision energy. The differences of the quantum cross-sections are slightly higher than QCT calculations near the threshold energy. This result clearly shows that the quantum tunneling processes have some contributions to the reaction at low collision energies. The exact nonadiabatic quantum results taken from Han et al. [12] are also presented in Fig. 1 , which is involves four electronic potential energy surfaces of the 3A\u2033 (1), 3A\u2033 (2), 3A\u2032 and 1A\u2032. The initial wave packet is on the 3A\u2033 (1), referred to as GLDP PES, and the cross-sections both over the adiabatic and nonadiabatic channels have been added together. The differences of calculation comes from the diversity of PESs primarily, but we also can see that, with the collision energy increase, the QCT calculated cross-sections of the product OH molecule on the BMS1 PES show nearly qualitative agreement with the nonadiabatic result. It should be mentioned that due to spin\u2013orbit coupling in the oxygen atom, the O( 3 P ) + H 2 reaction is a multisurface problem. Recent trajectory surface hopping studies [9,33] that include the spin\u2013orbit coupling and intersystem crossing effects arising from the singlet\u2013triplet interaction have shown that, the spin\u2013orbit induced transition would cause a moderate increase in the integral cross section with collision energy of 10 kcal/mol higher than the reactive threshold. The quantum dynamics calculations [12] clearly demonstrate that the spin\u2013orbit coupling between the triplet states of different symmetries has the greatest contribution to the intersystem crossing. Furthermore, they confirmed that the product ratio of the OH spin state \u03a0 3/2 to \u03a0 1/2 for the wave packet initially on the triplet surface is around 2.75:1 at collision energies higher than 0.6 eV, while it covers a wide range of 3:1\u20135:1 at lower energies [12] . Obviously, the contribution to the cross-section of OH come from \u03a0 3/2 state is preference to that of \u03a0 1/2 state. The polarization dependent \u201cgeneralized\u201d differential cross section (PDDCS) for the reaction O( 3 P ) + H 2 ( v = 0\u20132) \u2192 OH + H at a collision energy of 34.6 kcal/mol (\u223c1.5 eV) are presented. The P ( \u03b8 r ) distribution, as shown in Fig. 2 a, describes the k \u2013 j \u2032 correlation. For three vibrational states, the peaks of P ( \u03b8 r ) are at \u03b8 r = 90\u00b0 and symmetric with respect to 90\u00b0, which shows that j \u2032 is distributed with cylindrical symmetry in the product scattering frame and is always perpendicular to k . However, the peaks of P ( \u03b8 r ) are narrower and higher with the increasing vibrational quantum number. This means that the product rotational alignment effect becomes stronger as the vibrational state of H 2 molecule increases. The dihedral angle distribution P ( \u03d5 r ) shown in Fig. 2 b tends to be antisymmetric with respect to the scattering plane, directly reflecting the strong polarization of angular momentum induced by potential energy surface. The functions P ( \u03d5 r ), describing the k \u2013 k \u2032\u2013 j \u2032 correlations, is in good accordance with the results obtained by Han and co-workers [22] that the distribution of j \u2032 does not have azimuthal symmetry for the H + LL \u2192 HL + L mass combination (H: heavy, L: light) on repulsive potential energy surface. All the three trajectories, the peaks of P ( \u03d5 r ) appear at \u03d5 r = 270\u00b0 but almost disappear at \u03d5 r = 90\u00b0, which show that the rotational angular momentum vector of the product OH is mainly aligned along the y -axis of the CM frame. The peaks at \u03d5 r = 270\u00b0 is apparently higher than any other degrees, which show that the rotational angular momentum vector j \u2032 is not only aligned, but also preferentially oriented along the negative direction of y -axis. It seems interesting that the title reaction is symmetric about the relative velocity vector, while the distribution of P ( \u03d5 r ) is asymmetric. For the reaction O( 3 P ) + H 2 \u2192 OH + H orientation of the product OH results from the repulsive energy between two H atoms, which leads to the violation of the symmetry when the reaction occurs. According to the impulse model [30,31] about the molecular reaction for the reaction A + BC \u2192 AB + C , we have (1) j \u2032 = L sin 2 \u03b2 + j cos 2 \u03b2 + J 1 m B / m AB , where L is the reagent orbital angular momentum and J 1 = \u03bc BC R ( r AB \u00d7 r CB ) , r AB , r CB are unit vectors, where B points to A and C , respectively; \u03bc BC is the reduced mass of the BC molecule and R is the repulsive energy. During the chemical-bond forming and breaking for reaction, the term L sin 2 \u03b2 + j cos 2 \u03b2 in the equation is symmetric, while the term J 1 m B / m AB shows a preferential direction because of the effect of repulsive energy, which leads to the orientation of the product OH. From vibrational state v = 0 to v = 2 at the collision energy of 34.6 kcal/mol, the distribution of P ( \u03d5 r ) obtained on the BSM1 PES are qualitatively similar, but the observed orientation of the j \u2032 vectors in the CM frame is stronger as the vibrational state increases. With the vibrational excitation, the preference for out-of-plane changes to a preference for in-plane reaction. At collision energy of 34.6 kcal/mol, the vibrational excitation has a positive effect on the product rotational polarization. The vibrational population in the products is more or less a copy of the vibrational structure in the reagents, although with increasing vibrational quantum number in the reagents the final distributions are gradually broadened [32] . The repulsive energy R , which is correlated to the vibrational quantum number, can take an ulterior step to influences the product rotational polarization. Brand\u00e3o et al. used a semiempirical functional form to explicitly account for the R \u2212 n radial dependence characteristic of long-range interactions [8] and this modification deepens the van der Waals well at collinear abstraction geometry ( C \u221ev symmetry). It is known that the O( 3 P ) + H 2 \u2192 OH + H reaction occurs through the 3 \u03a0 collinear saddle point where 3 A \u2032 and 3 A \u2033 states are degenerate. The intersystem crossing between these two collinear states occurs when the distance between O and the nearest H is 4.5 a 0 . This is of significant importance since it has been recognized that long-range features of the PES, such as shallow wells in the reactant and product valleys, can play a decisive role in the outcome of encounters between reactive species [9,12] . In this paper, the QCT calculation adopts adiabatic approximation and it does not distinguish the electronic state under consideration, thus it cannot separate the 3 \u03a0 and 3 \u03a3 states of the O( 3 P ) approaching H 2 system. Nevertheless, this provided a lowest energy description of both 3 \u03a0 and 3 \u03a3 states at C \u221ev symmetry, which is required for an adequate van der Waals region model. From the results of stereodynamics calculation, the influence of the van der Waals well associated with the O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H\u2013H complexes on different vibration states is remarkable. The delays of transition state enable to lose the \u201cmemory\u201d of angular momentum alignment in that the separation of the product, which is leading to the angular polarization decrease. The polarization dependent generalized differential cross-sections (PDDCSs) describe the k \u2013 k \u2032 \u2013 j \u2032 correlation and the scattering direction of the product molecule OH. In our paper, we only discuss the PDDCS (2 \u03c0 / \u03c3 )( d\u03c3 00 / d\u03c9 t ) and (2 \u03c0 / \u03c3 )( d\u03c3 20 / d\u03c9 t ). The PDDCS (2 \u03c0 / \u03c3 )( d\u03c3 00 / d\u03c9 t ), which is simply the differential cross-section (DCS), only describes the k \u2013 k \u2032 correlation or the scattering direction of the product and is not associated with the orientation and alignment of the product rotational angular momentum vector j \u2032. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the products are scattered strongly sideways for v = 0 and v = 1, but forward scattering appears to be strongest for v = 2. Also, the forward scattering becomes stronger and the backward scattering becomes weaker with increasing vibrational quantum numbers. Obviously, (2 \u03c0 / \u03c3 )( d\u03c3 00 / d\u03c9 t ) is sensitively to the initial vibrational state of the reactant H 2 . The relationship between vibrational state and the products\u2019 proportion of average energy is shown in Fig. 4 . It can be seen that the proportion of kinetic energy \u3008 f tr \u2032 \u3009 decreases, while proportion of vibrational energy \u3008 f v \u2032 \u3009 and rotational energy \u3008 f R \u2032 \u3009 increase with the vibrational state from v = 0 to v = 2. Scattering direction of product is related to the proportion of kinetic energy \u3008 f tr \u2032 \u3009 . The proportion of kinetic energy \u3008 f tr \u2032 \u3009 decreases implies that the propensity of forward scattering. So we conclude that the energy distribution is changed under the influence of different initial vibrational states. The PDDCS (2 \u03c0 / \u03c3 )( d\u03c3 20 / d\u03c9 t ), which is the expectation value of the second Legendre moment, is drawn in Fig. 3 b. As can be seen from Fig. 3 b, the behavior of (2 \u03c0 / \u03c3 )( d\u03c3 20 / d\u03c9 t ) shows the trend which is opposite to that of (2 \u03c0 / \u03c3 )( d\u03c3 00 / d\u03c9 t ), indicating that j \u2032 is strongly aligned perpendicular to k . The distributions of (2 \u03c0 / \u03c3 )( d\u03c3 20 / d\u03c9 t ) sensitively depends on scattering angles for three vibrational states. The j \u2032 is preferentially polarized along the direction perpendicular to k when the fragments OH are scattered sideways for v = 0 and v = 1, but forward and backward for v = 2. 4 Conclusions Quasi-classical trajectory calculations of the product rotational polarization for the O( 3 P ) + H 2 ( v = 0\u20132) \u2192 OH + H reaction have been performed on BMS1 PES at a collision energy of 34.6 kcal/mol by using QCT theories. Reaction cross-sections have been calculated in the range of 12.6\u201325 kcal/mol of collision energies, which is good agreement with the time-dependent quantum mechanics (TDQM) [12,29] . We get the P ( \u03b8 r ) and P ( \u03d5 r ) distribution for different vibrational states at the collision energy of 34.6 kcal/mol. The rotational angular momentum vectors j \u2032 of the products are not only aligned, but also oriented. The observed orientation of the j \u2032 vectors becomes stronger with the vibrational quantum number increases at the collision energy of 34.6 kcal/mol. It is well explained by impulse model. The PDDCS (2 \u03c0 / \u03c3 )( d\u03c3 00 / d\u03c9 t ) predicts that the scattering distributions of products are very sensitive to various initial vibrational states of the hydrogen molecule. The results of (2 \u03c0 / \u03c3 )( d\u03c3 20 / d\u03c9 t ) show that the j \u2032 is polarized perpendicular to k and sensitively affected by vibrational excitation.

Furthermore, the influence of reagent vibrational excitation on the product vector properties has also been studied in the present work.

As distributed applications increase in size and complexity, an authorization architecture based on point-to-point communication becomes fragile and difficult to manage. This paper presents the use of the publish-subscribe (pub-sub) model for delivering authorization requests and responses between the applications and the authorization servers. Our analysis suggests that using the pub-sub architecture improves authorization system availability and reduces system administration overhead. We evaluate our design using a prototype implementation, which confirms the improvement in availability. Although the response time is also increased, this impact can be reduced by bypassing the pub-sub channel when returning authorizations or by caching coupled with local inference of authorization decisions based on previously cached authorizations.",

        "abstract": "A novel small-molecule acceptor, (2,2'-((5E,5'E)-5,5'-((5,5'-(4,4,9,9-tetrakis(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b']dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(methanylylidene)) bis(3-hexyl-4-oxothiazolidine-5,2-diylidene))dimalononitrile (ITCN), end-capped with electron-deficient 2-(3-hexyl-4-oxothiazolidin-2-ylidene)malononitrile groups, is designed, synthesized, and used as the third component in fullerene-free ternary polymer solar cells (PSCs). The cascaded energy-level structure enabled by the newly designed acceptor is beneficial to the carrier transport and separation. Meanwhile, the three materials show a complementary absorption in the visible region, resulting in efficient light harvesting. Hence, the PBDB-T:ITCN:IT-M ternary PSCs possess a high short-circuit current density (J ) under an optimal weight ratio of donors and acceptors. Moreover, the open-circuit voltage (V ) of the ternary PSCs is enhanced with an increase of the third acceptor ITCN content, which is attributed to the higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level of ITCN than that of IT-M, thus exhibits a higher V in PBDB-T:ITCN binary system. Ultimately, the ternary PSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency of 12.16%, which is higher than the PBDB-T:ITM-based PSCs (10.89%) and PBDB-T:ITCN-based ones (2.21%). This work provides an effective strategy to improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.",

        "abstract": "Thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitters were usually designed as Donor-Acceptor structures with large dihedral angles, which tends to incur low fluorescent efficiency, and therefore various methods through molecule design have been put forward to increase the emitters' efficiency, however, rare studies were conducted to compare these methods in one TADF system. In this study, a novel TADF molecule BP-DPAC was designed as prototype, and its two derivatives BP-Ph-DPAC and DPAC-BP-DPAC were also prepared to represent two common approaches to enhance TADF performance. Compared with BP-DPAC's maximal external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 6.82%, DPAC-BP-DPAC based organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) devices exhibited enhanced TADF properties with the highest maximum EQE of 18.67%, due to additional donor of diphenylacridine, while BP-Ph-DPAC showed non-TADF properties and exhibited the lowest EQE of 4.25%, due to inserting the phenyl ring between donor and acceptor.",

        "abstract": "All-solution-processing at low temperatures is important and desirable for making printed photovoltaic devices and also offers the possibility of a safe and cost-effective fabrication environment for the devices. Herein, an all-solution-processed flexible organic solar cell (OSC) using poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-(styrenesulfonate) electrodes is reported. The all-solution-processed flexible devices yield the highest power conversion efficiency of 10.12% with high fill factor of over 70%, which is the highest value for metal-oxide-free flexible OSCs reported so far. The enhanced performance is attributed to the newly developed gentle acid treatment at room temperature that enables a high-performance PEDOT:PSS/plastic underlying substrate with a matched work function (\u22484.91 eV), and the interface engineering that endows the devices with better interface contacts and improved hole mobility. Furthermore, the flexible devices exhibit an excellent mechanical flexibility, as indicated by a high retention (\u224894%) of the initial efficiency after 1000 bending cycles. This work provides a simple route to fabricate high-performance all-solution-processed flexible OSCs, which is important for the development of printing, blading, and roll-to-roll technologies.",

At present, TADF polymers are still limited in category and complicated in preparation, which hinders their proceeding into industrial application. Besides, a still-too-low quantum efficiency poses a challenge for TADF-polymer-based OLEDs. In this review, different topologies and design strategies of the existing TADF polymers are covered, their structure-property relationships are illustrated, their first applications in OLED devices are discussed, and finally, an outlook of promising design rules for future TADF polymers is provided. The hope is to inspire researchers to develop TADF polymers prepared by easier synthesis strategies and higher external quantum efficiency to promote emitter application.",

        "abstract": "The interface strategy has been identified as an effective process to optimize the overall performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs). Herein, three novel non-conjugated small molecules comprising amino cations and sulfonate anions, as well as various core atoms of oxygen, sulfur, and sulfone, were successfully synthesized and employed as cathode interlayers (CILs) for non-fullerene PSCs. A large improvement of the device performance was observed, in which the solution processed sulfur-based CIL shows excellent cathode modification ability and device properties with the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.30%. Compared with the vacuum deposited Ca, the non-conjugated small-molecule CILs could significantly increase the charge transport and collection capabilities, decrease the work function (WF) of the Al counter electrode, and reduce the series resistance and charge recombination at the interface. Most importantly, these simple water/alcohol soluble CILs are of great significance and suitable for the low-cost and large-area preparation of PSCs.",

To make the OLEDs more useful, efficient materials are highly desired. Herein, two novel multifunctional sky-blue emitters, TPE-m-PCzI and TPE-m-TPAI, have been developed with the integration of imidazole, carbazole, triphenyl amine and tetraphenylethene groups. These materials show high photoluminescence quantum yields. Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) behavior, thermal stability and glass transition temperatures of these materials are also examined. Non-doped OLEDs fabricated employing these materials as emitters exhibit sky-blue electroluminescence and demonstrate high efficiencies of 2.22% (4.56\u202fcd/A, 3.15 lm/W) and 3.1% (5.74\u202fcd/A, 3.31 lm/W) for TPE-m-PCzI and TPE-m-TPAI. High performance of TPE-m-TPAI based device shows a bright prospect of imidazole and AIEgen integration to prepare efficient fluorescent materials for OLED devices.",

As a result, the high power conversion efficiency of 8.35% and 10.55% is achieved for fullerene PTB7:PC71BM-based devices and non-fullerene PBDB-T:IT-M-based devices, respectively.

        "abstract": "A novel polymer material, poly{5,10-bis(5-ethylhexyl-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)dithieno[2,3-d:2\u2032,3\u2032-d\u2032\u2032]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b\u2032]dithiophene-co-1,3-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H,8H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c\u2032]dithiophene-4,8-dione} (PDBT-F) is designed, synthesized, and used as a donor in polymer solar cells. Dithieno[2,3-d:2\u2032,3\u2032-d\u2032\u2032]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b\u2032]dithiophene (DTBDT) with an extended conjugation length shows better \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking, higher charge-carrier mobility, and broader absorptions to boost the photovoltaic performance. Further introducing fluorine atoms in side groups effectively deepens the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level to enhance the open-circuit voltage (Voc), promotes \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking to increase the short-circuit current density (Jsc), thus obtaining a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.02% with IDIC. Moreover, ternary devices of PDBT-F:IDIC:PC71BM are constructed. As expected, the ternary device shows a higher Jsc by virtue of the absorption complementarity of PDBT-F:IDIC:PC71BM, thus gaining extended absorption; a higher Voc is caused by the deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of PC71BM. The cascaded LUMO levels of PDBT-F, PC71BM and IDIC facilitate the charge transfer, finally achieving a PCE of 11.86% with a PC71BM content of 10%. The results we report show the best performances based on DTBDT materials. This work also demonstrates that it is a wise strategy to combine a fullerene derivative with non-fullerene acceptors to construct high-performance ternary solar cells.",

For this purpose pH and temperature dual-responsive and photo-cross-linked hollow capsules, based on silica-templated layer-by-layer approach by using poly(-isopropyl acrylamide)--polymethacrylate) and polyallylamine, have been prepared to use them for the subsequent and easily available post-encapsulation process of protein-like macromolecules at room temperature and pH 7.4 and their controllable release triggered by stimuli. The uptake and release properties of the hollow capsules for cargos are highly affected by changes in the external stimuli temperature (25, 37, or 45 \u00b0C) and internal stimuli pH of the phosphate-containing buffer solution (5.5 or 7.4), by the degree of photo-cross-linking, and the size of cargo. The photo-cross-linked and dual stimuli-responsive hollow capsules with different membrane permeability can be considered as attractive material for mimicking cell functions triggered by controllable uptake and release of different up to 11 nm sized biomolecules.",

        "abstract": "Nondestructive flaw detection in polymeric materials is important but difficult to achieve. In this research, the application of magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) in nondestructive flaw detection is studied and realized, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time. Superparamagnetic and highly magnetic (up to 63 emu/g) magnetite core-shell nanoparticles are prepared by grafting bromo-end-group-functionalized poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (Br-PGMA) onto surface-modified FeO NPs. These FeO-PGMA NPs are blended into bisphenol A diglycidylether (BADGE)-based epoxy to form homogeneously distributed magnetic epoxy nanocomposites (MENCs) after curing. The core FeO of the FeO-PGMA NPs endows the MENCs with magnetic property, which is crucial for nondestructive flaw detection of the materials, while the shell PGMA promotes colloidal stability and prevents NP aggregation during curing. The eddy current testing (ET) technique is first applied to detect flaws in the MENCs. Through the brightness contrast of the ET image, surficial and subsurficial flaws in MENCs can be detected, even for MENCs with low content of FeO-PGMA NPs (1 wt %). The incorporation of FeO-PGMA NPs can be easily extended to other polymer and polymer-based composite systems and opens a new and very promising pathway toward MNP-based nondestructive flaw detection in polymeric materials.",

In this study, two compounds with high content of naphthalene groups, 1,5-dithiolnaphthalene and 1,3,5-tris(naphthalyl\u2013ethylnyl) benzene, are selected as \u201cA2\u201d and \u201cB3\u201d monomers, respectively to prepare hyperbranched HRI polymers. Metal-free radical-initiated \u201cA2 + B3\u201d thiol-yne polyaddition is conducted successfully at different monomer molar ratios even for those sterically demanding molecules being able to adjust the molar mass as well as RI. Polymers with refractive index up to 1.79 at 589.7 nm are obtained, which are among the highest RI values so far reported for pure polymer-based materials. The high RI, based on the high molar refraction of naphthalene group, metal-free and easy one-pot synthesis, high transparency in the visible area, good thermal stability, good solubility, and easy processability into thin films, make these polymers excellent candidates for optic-electronic applications.",

These properties make them ideal candidates as high RI polymeric materials (HRIP) in connection with light out-coupling schemes for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). A series of hyperbranched HRIPs with varying monomer compositions have been compared in their optical properties. Finally, phosphorescent monochrome OLEDs are fabricated on top of HRIP layers to test the compatibility of HRIPs with state-of-the-art OLEDs. The results show that the HRIPs do not deteriorate the performance of the OLEDs while maintaining external quantum efficiencies of over 20% for phosphorescent red OLEDs.

        "abstract": "Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)-type compounds have great potential as emitter molecules in organic light-emitting diodes, allowing for electrofluorescence with 100% internal quantum efficiency. In small molecules, TADF is achieved through the formation of intramolecular charge-transfer states. The only design limitation is the requirement that donor and acceptor entities spatially decouple the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, respectively, to minimize exchange splitting. The development of polymeric TADF emitters, on the contrary, has seen comparably small progress and those are typically built up from monomeric units that show promising TADF properties in small molecule studies beforehand. By contrast, herein, a way to achieve TADF properties in cyclic oligomers and polymers composed of non-TADF building blocks is shown. Due to a strongly decreased energy splitting of the polymer with respect to the individual repeating unit between the lowest singlet and triplet excited state (\u0394EST) and a sufficiently high radiative decay rate kSr, a highly efficient TADF polymer with up to 71% photoluminescence quantum yield is obtained. For the first time, an encouraging method is provided for producing highly efficient TADF oligomers and polymers from solely non-TADF units via induced conjugation, opening a new design strategy exclusive for polymers.",

Solution processable HB-PVS show a near ultraviolet absorption inducing an increased refractive index in the visible-near infrared (n\u2009=\u20091.68, \u03bb\u2009=\u20091000 nm). HBPVS:Cellulose Acetate Distributed Bragg Reflectors show a very clear fingerprint of the photonic band gap possessing the expected polarized dispersion properties as a function of the incidence angle. Moreover, engineered microcavities tuned on the weak fluorescence spectrum of the HB-PVS show directional fluorescence enhancement effects due to spectral redistribution of the emission oscillator strength. The combination of all these properties testifies the high optical quality of the obtained photonic structures thus indicating HB-PVS as an interesting material for the preparation of such PhC. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Nine image features including one spectral feature (gray level values), a distance feature, and seven textural\n features were employed to develop the classifiers. The selected internal wood characteristics to be identified included heartwood,\n sapwood, bark, and knots. Twenty cross-sectional CT images of a black spruce log were randomly selected to develop the two\n classifiers. The results suggest that both classifiers produced high classification accuracy. Compared with the MLC classifier\n (80.9% overall accuracy), the BP ANN classifier had better classification performance (97.6% overall accuracy). Moreover,\n statistical analysis reveals that the heartwood of the black spruce log used in this study is the easiest to identify by either\n classifier compared with the other three log features. The results also suggest that the separability of one wood characteristic\n from the other wood characteristics in black spruce CT images is mainly related to moisture content.",

However, the efficiency of producing transgenic primate animals is presently very low, and there are few reports of success. We have developed an improved methodology for the production of transgenic rhesus monkeys, making use of a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-based vector that encodes EGFP and a protocol for infection of early-cleavage-stage embryos. We show that infection does not alter embryo development. Moreover, the timing of infection, either before or during embryonic genome activation, has no observable effect on the level and stability of transgene expression. Of 70 embryos injected with concentrated virus at the one- to two-cell stage or the four- to eight-cell stage and showing fluorescence, 30 were transferred to surrogate mothers. One transgenic fetus was obtained from a fraternal triple pregnancy. Four infant monkeys were produced from four singleton pregnancies, of which two expressed EGFP throughout the whole body. These results demonstrate the usefulness of SIV-based lentiviral vectors for the generation of transgenic monkeys and improve the efficiency of transgenic technology in nonhuman primates.",

Herein, we describe the derivation of rabbit trophoblast stem cells from embryonic stem (ES) cells. Rabbit ES cells generated in our laboratory were induced to differentiate in the presence of BMP4 and TS-like cell colonies were isolated and expanded. These cells expressed the molecular markers of mouse TS cells, were able to invade, give rise to derivatives of TS cells, and chimerize placental tissues when injected into blastocysts. The rabbit TS-like cells maintained self-renewal in culture medium with serum but without growth factors or feeder cells, whilst their proliferation and identity were compromised by inhibitors of FGFs and TGF-\u03b2 receptors. Taken together, our study demonstrated the derivation of rabbit TS cells and suggested the essential roles of FGF and TGF-\u03b2 signalings in maintenance of rabbit TS cell self-renewal.",

        "abstract": "Parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells are considered as a promising resource for regeneration medicine and powerful tools for developmental biology. A lot of studies have revealed that embryonic stem cells have distinct microRNA expression pattern and these microRNAs play important roles in self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells. However, few studies concern about microRNA expression pattern in parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells, especially in non-human primate--the ideal model species for human, largely due to the limited rhesus monkey parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells (rpESCs) available and lack of systematic analysis of the basics of rpESCs. Here, we derived two novel rpESCs lines and characterized their microRNA signature by Solexa deep sequencing. These two novel rpESCs shared many properties with other primate ESCs, including expression of pluripotent markers, capacity to generate derivatives representative of all three germ layers in vivo and in vitro, maintaining of euploid karyotype even after long culture. Additionally, lack of some paternally expressed imprinted genes and identity of Single-nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) compare to their oocyte donors support their parthenogenesis origin. By characterizing their microRNA signature, we identified 91 novel microRNAs, except those are also detected in other primate ESCs. Moreover, these two novel rpESCs display a unique microRNA signature, comparing to their biparental counterpart ESCs. Then we analyzed X chromosome status in these two novel rpESCs; results suggested that one of them possesses two active X chromosomes, the other possesses only one active X chromosome liking biparental female embryonic stem cells. Taken together, our novel rpESCs provide a new alternative to existing rhesus monkey embryonic stem cells, microRNA information expands rhesus monkey microRNA data and may help understanding microRNA roles in pluripotency and parthenogenesis.",

        "abstract": "We successfully designed and fabricated an absorption-type of superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonators. The resonators are made from a niobium film (about 160 nm thick) on a high-resistance Si substrate, and each resonator is fabricated as a meandered quarter-wavelength transmission line (one end is short to the ground and another end is capacitively coupled to a through feedline). With a vector network analyzer we measured the transmissions of the applied microwave through the resonators at ultra-low temperature. The obtained loaded quality factors are significantly high, i.e. up to \uff5e10 6 . When the temperature increases slowly from the base temperature (20 mK), the resonance frequencies of the resonators are blue shifted and the quality factors are lowered slightly. In principle, this type of device can integrate a series of CPW resonators with a common feedline, making it a promising candidate as the data bus for coupling distant solid-state qubits and the sensitive detector of single photons.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Phenomenally, Cooper pairs can be broken up by external energy and thus the Cooper-pair density in the superconducting electrodes of a Josephson junction (JJ) under radiation can be lowered accordingly. Therefore, by probing the shift of the switching current through the junction, the radiation power absorbed by the superconductors can be detected. Here, we experimentally demonstrate weak optical detections in two types of JJs: Al/AlO  x  /Al junction (Al-J) and Nb/AlO  x  /Nb junction (Nb-J), with the superconducting transition temperatures       T    c    \u2248  1.2    K     and 6.8\u00a0K respectively. The photon-induced switching current shifts are measured at ultra-low temperature     (  T  \u2248  16    mK  )     in order to significantly suppress thermal noises. It is observed that the Al-J has a higher sensitivity than the Nb-J, which is expected since Al has a smaller superconducting gap energy than Nb. The minimum detectable optical powers (at 1550\u00a0nm) with the present Al-J and Nb-J are measured as 8\u00a0pW and 2\u00a0nW respectively, and the noise equivalent power (NEP) are estimated to be     7  \u00d7    10    -  11      W    /      Hz       (for Nb-J) and     3  \u00d7    10    -  12      W    /      Hz       (for Al-J). We also find that the observed switching current responses are dominated by the photon-induced thermal effects. Several methods are proposed to further improve the device sensitivity, so that the JJ based devices can be applicable in photon detections.",

In previous studies, the series-connected CSIs are controlled based on assumptions that all CSIs are ideal and identical and the power is evenly distributed among them. However, in practice, such assumptions are invalid as tolerance exists. This study therefore works on the investigation of power distribution among series-connected CSIs considering the tolerance. First, the possible imbalance of power among CSIs is unveiled, analyzed, and quantitatively defined. Second, a combined control scheme is proposed, based on which both conventional control objectives, which are dc-link current control and power factor control, and an equal power distribution among CSIs are ensured simultaneously. Finally, simulations and lab-scaled experiments are provided.",

        "abstract": "Input-series output-series (ISOS) modular dc\u2013dc converters are suitable for applications involving high input and output voltages. Input voltage sharing (IVS) and output voltage sharing (OVS) of the constituent modules must be guaranteed for an ISOS system. A duty cycle-based model predictive control (DC-MPC) scheme is proposed in this paper to achieve IVS and OVS for an ISOS system. The employed switching frequency in the DC-MPC scheme is fixed; duty cycles are optimized and then determined by minimizing a cost function, which is derived from an ISOS system aimed at achieving IVS and OVS. IVS and OVS can, therefore, be obtained by employing the optimized duty cycle within each sampling period. In addition, challenges and disadvantages of directly using traditional MPC to achieve IVS and OVS is briefly discussed, while the proposed DC-MPC can effectively avoid them. Compared with the existing proportional integral-based schemes in the literature, the proposed DC-MPC is better for IVS and OVS because it is a very simple and intuitive approach with lower cost and higher overall dynamic performance. Simulation and experiments are conducted to verify that the proposed DC-MPC scheme works well during both steady and transient states.",

Conventional space vector modulation (SVM) features fast dynamic response but its output contains low-order harmonics with high magnitudes. Recently, a natural-sampling-based SVM (NS-SVM) with superior low-order harmonics performance has been proposed for MV CSCs. This study further investigates the low-order harmonics performance of different space vector sequences for MV CSCs based on NS-SVM. Dwell times equations based on NS-SVM for each space vector sequence with minimized switching frequency are analyzed and derived; comparisons of different vector sequences in terms of low-order harmonics and load/grid-side total demand distortion performance are thoroughly conducted. Among all the investigated sequences, sequence 2 (SQ2) is the best one; its linear two-step dwell times equations are provided for online implementation. Simulations and experiments are provided to verify its performance.",

Apart from fulfilling traditional control objectives (maximum power point tracking, dc-link current control, and reactive power regulation), this study endeavors to ensure evenly distributed power and voltage sharing among the constituent modules given the cascaded structure of the MFT-based converter. In addition, this paper thoroughly discusses the characteristic of decoupling between the voltage/power balancing of the modular converter and the other control objectives. Finally, both simulation and experimental results are provided to reflect the performance of the proposed system.",

        "abstract": "The biggest challenge for existing offshore wind farms is the bulky and costly offshore substation. Series-connected offshore wind farm configuration, on the other hand, featuring no offshore substation, is getting increased attention in the research. In this study, a medium frequency transformer (MFT)-based configuration is proposed for such series-connected offshore wind farms. The proposed configuration consists of two parts, offshore and onshore. The modular multilevel converter (MMC) is employed at onshore, while the offshore part is composed of numbers of series-connected wind turbine-based systems. Each wind turbine-based system consists of a medium-voltage permanent magnet synchronous generator, a passive three-phase rectifier, and a modular MFT-based converter. By contrast to the commercial offshore wind farm, the proposed configuration features low cost thanks to the series-connected structure; by contrast to configurations in the literature, the present configuration features high power density, high reliability and flexibility thanks to the adoption of the modular MFT-based converter. Apart from fulfilling traditional control objectives (maximum power point tracking, dc-link voltage control, and reactive power regulation), this work endeavors to ensure evenly distributed power and voltage sharing among the constituent modules given the cascaded structure of the MFT-based converter.

        "abstract": "Conventional space vector modulation (SVM)-based common-mode voltage (CMV) reduction in medium-voltage (MV) current source rectifier (CSR) cannot be used in practice. Conventional SVM contains high-magnitude low-order harmonics, particularly the fifth and seventh harmonics, that are lying closely to the resonance frequency (4.5\u20135.5\u00a0p.u.) of the  LC  filter of the converter, thus, introducing resonance as the grid-side damping is small. Recently, a natural sampling SVM (NS-SVM) with superior low-order harmonics performance has been proposed for MV CSR. On this basis, a NS-SVM-based CMV reduction method is proposed for MV CSR in this paper. The proposed scheme achieves both good CMV reduction and superior low-order harmonics performance simultaneously. Additionally, effort to lower computational burden on calculating dwell times is made. Experiments are finally provided.",

        "abstract": "Current source converter (CSC)-based wind energy conversion systems (WECSs) are recently gaining increasingly attention due to its reliable short-circuit protection. However, all existing CSC-based configurations are proposed for medium-voltage (MV) (3\u20134 kV) wind turbine systems, but not for low-voltage (LV) (690 V) systems which are dominating the market of WECS. The biggest challenge for using CSCs in LV systems is no proper switching devices in the market. This paper proposes a new configuration, where a proven modular LV voltage source converter is used as the generator-side converter to be compatible with an MV CSC. By such a design, MV CSCs are successfully used in LV systems with all advantages being inherited. In addition, this configuration features high reliability and reduced size and weight, thanks to the adoption of the modular converter. The performance of the configuration under normal and fault conditions are investigated. Apart from fulfilling traditional control objectives in WECS, a current balancing control is added to ensure safe operation. Additionally, limits and constraints of the configuration using in practice are discussed. Finally, simulation and down-scaled experimental results are presented.",

Different types of modulation schemes with different harmonic performance lead to different capacitor selections. Conventional space vector modulation (SVM) featuring high dynamic performance cannot be used in practice even with the help of active damping, which can effectively damp the possible  LC  resonance introduced by conventional SVM. Recently, a natural-sampling SVM (NS-SVM) is proposed for MV CSC drives. It features superior low-order harmonics and has been highly considered for MV CSCs in practice. This study, therefore, focuses on two issues. One is why conventional SVM cannot be used in practice even with the help of active damping. On this basis, the second is capacitor minimization based on NS-SVM. Finally, experimental verification is provided.",

However, two problems exist in conventional strategy of such a system. One is increased cost on onshore CSCs, and the other is decreased operation efficiency of onshore CSCs.

Second, an optimal control scheme is proposed for onshore CSCs with lower operation loss. In addition, it is implemented without any extra components or auxiliary circuits.

        "abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective and rapid treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the neurobiological underpinnings of ECT are still largely unknown. Recent studies have identified dysregulated brain networks in MDD. Therefore, we hypothesized that ECT may improve MDD symptoms through reorganizing these networks. To test this hypothesis, we used resting-state functional connectivity to investigate changes to the intra- and internetwork architecture of five reproducible resting-state networks: the default mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), executive control network (CON), salience network (SAL), and sensory-motor network. Twenty-three MDD patients were assessed before and after ECT, along with 25 sex-, age-, and education-matched healthy controls. At the network level, enhanced intranetwork connectivities were found in the CON in MDD patients after ECT. Furthermore, enhanced internetwork connectivities between the DMN and SAL, and between the CON and DMN, DAN, and SAL were also identified. At the nodal level, the posterior cingulate cortex had increased connections with the left posterior cerebellum, right posterior intraparietal sulcus (rpIPS), and right anterior prefrontal cortex. The rpIPS had increased connections with the medial PFC (mPFC) and left anterior cingulate cortex. The left lateral parietal had increased connections with the dorsal mPFC (dmPFC), left anterior prefrontal cortex, and right anterior cingulate cortex. The dmPFC had increased connection with the left anterolateral prefrontal cortex. Our findings indicate that enhanced interactions in intra- and internetworks may contribute to the ECT response in MDD patients. These findings provide novel and important insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying ECT.",

        "abstract": "Emotional memory bias is considered to be an important base of the etiology of depression and can be reversed by antidepressants via enhancing the memory for positive stimuli. Another antidepressant treatment, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), has rapid antidepressant effect and frequently causes short-term memory impairment. However, it is unclear about the short-term effect of ECT on memory bias. In this study, the incidental memory task with emotional pictures were applied to evaluate the emotional memory of twenty depressed patients at pre- and post-ECT (three days after ECT) compared to twenty healthy controls. The depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Hamilton rating scale of depression (HRSD). Before ECT, patients showed decreased recognition memory for positive pictures compared to controls and remembered negative pictures more easily than positive pictures in the recognition task. In patients, the main effect of session (pre-ECT and post-ECT) was significant for both recognition and recall memory with reduced memory performance. The interaction between valence (positive, neutral and negative) and session was significant for recognition memory, indicating that negative memory was impaired more severely than positive memory. Our study indicates that ECT relieves depressive symptoms and regulates emotional memory through more severe impairment on memory for negative stimuli.",

        "abstract": "Despite decades of research on depression, the underlying pathophysiology of depression remains incompletely understood. Emerging evidence from task-based studies suggests that the abnormal reward-related processing contribute to the development of depression. It is unclear about the function pattern of reward-related circuit during resting state in depressive patients. In present study, seed-based functional connectivity was used to evaluate the functional pattern of reward-related circuit during resting state. Selected seeds were two key nodes in reward processing, medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Fifty depressive patients and 57 healthy participants were included in present study. Clinical severity of participants was assessed with Hamilton depression scale and Hamilton anxiety scale. We found that compared with healthy participants, depressive patients showed decreased connectivity of right mOFC with left temporal pole (TP_L), right insula extending to superior temporal gyrus (INS_R/STG) and increased connectivity of right mOFC with left precuneus. Similarly, decreased connectivity of left mOFC with TP_L and increased connectivity with cuneus were found in depressive patients. There is also decreased connectivity of right NAcc with bilateral temporal pole, as well as decreased connectivity of left NAcc with INS_R/STG. In addition, the functional connectivity of right nucleus accumbens with right temporal pole (TP_R) was negatively correlated with clinical severity. Our results emphasize the role of communication deficits between reward systems and paralimbic cortex in the pathophysiology of depression.",

However, there is still ubiquitous inconsistency across these studies, partly due to several confounding effects induced by the use of different samples. Studies with independent samples are necessary for validations to minimize confounding effects. In the current study, resting-state magnetic resonance imaging of 84 participants was collected using two scanners and two types of scanning parameters. One sample consisted of 28 patients and 23 healthy controls, and the other sample consisted of 33 patients. The local activity (indexed by the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations) and functional connectivity were used to examine functional plasticity in the two independent samples before and after ECT. Both samples showed increased local activity of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and enhanced connectivity of the DMPFC with the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) following ECT. The enhanced connectivity between the DMPFC and PCC was positively associated with clinical improvement for both samples. These findings provide relatively strong evidence to support the functional plasticity of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and reorganization by ECT. The functional plasticity of the DMPFC-PCC may underlie the antidepressive effect of ECT.",

Recently, neuroimaging studies have reported that the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, angular gyrus, insular and other brain regions are involved in the mechanism of ECT for depression, and these regions are highly overlapped with the location of brain hubs. Here, we try to explore the effects of ECT on the functional connectivity of brain hubs in depression patients. In current study, depression patients were assessed at three time points: prior to ECT, at the completion of ECT and about 1 month after the completion of ECT. At each time point, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, assessment of clinical symptoms and cognition function were performed respectively, which was compared with 20 normal controls. Functional connectivity strength (FCS) was used to identify brain hubs. The results showed that FCS of left angular gyrus in depression patients significantly increased after ECT, accompanied by improved mood. The changed FCS in depression patients recovered obviously at 1 month after the completion of ECT. It suggested that ECT could modulate functional connectivity of left angular gyrus in depression patients.",

The insula is a critical brain structure for coordinating affective, cognitive memory, saliency processing, and attention switching suggesting functional activity of insula maybe an important indicator to delineate the treatment and side effects of ECT. Here, Resting-state functional connectivity analyses of insular subregions were performed to reveal the changes of connectivity in 23 MDD patients before and after ECT and 25 healthy control (HC) and identified significantly increased functional connectivity of the right ventral anterior insular subregion with bilateral caudate, angular gyrus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex after ECT. Granger causality analyses identified significantly increased effective connectivity from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to right angular gyrus in MDD patients after ECT. Furthermore, increased effective connectivity from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to right angular gyrus exhibited significantly positive correlation with changed Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores. These results showed that ECT can normalize abnormal functional connectivity and effective connectivity in MDD. Our findings also indicated that the right ventral anterior insula and effective connectivity from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to right angular gyrus are biomarkers of antidepressant effects during ECT of MDD.",

Accordingly, we hypothesized that subjects in the same phenotypic group have similar functional connectome features, which could help to discriminate schizophrenia (SCH) patients from healthy controls (HCs) and from depression patients. To this end, we included resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of SCH, depression patients, and HCs from three centers. We first investigated the characteristics of connectome similarity between individuals, and found higher similarity between subjects belonging to the same group (i.e., SCH-SCH) than different groups (i.e., HC-SCH). These findings suggest that the average connectome within group (termed as group-specific functional connectome [GFC]) may help in individual classification. Consistently, significant accuracy (75-77%) and area under curve (81-86%) were found in discriminating SCH from HC or depression patients by GFC-based leave-one-out cross-validation. Cross-center classification further suggests a good generalizability of the GFC classification. We additionally included normal aging data (255 young and 242 old subjects with different scanning sequences) to show factors could be improved for better classification performance, and the findings emphasized the importance of increasing sample size but not temporal resolution during scanning. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the average functional connectome across subjects contained group-specific biological features and may be helpful in clinical diagnosis for schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "Although electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD), the mechanism underlying the therapeutic efficacy and side effects of ECT remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated alterations in the cortical morphological measurements including cortical thickness (CT), surface area (SA), and local gyrification index (LGI) in 23 MDD patients before and after ECT. Furthermore, multivariate pattern analysis using linear support vector machine (SVM) was applied to investigate whether the changed morphological measurements can be effective indicators for therapeutic efficacy of ECT. Surface-based morphometry (SBM) analysis found significantly increased vertex-wise and regional cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) in widespread regions, mainly located in the left insula (INS) and left fusiform gyrus, as well as hypergyrification in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) in MDD patients after ECT. Partial correlational analyses identified associations between the morphological properties and depressive symptom scores and impaired memory scores. Moreover, SVM result showed that the changed morphological measurements were effective to classify the MDD patients before and after ECT. Our findings suggested that ECT may enhance cortical neuroplasticity to facilitate neurogenesis to remit depressive symptoms and to impair delayed memory. These findings indicated that the cortical morphometry is a good index for therapeutic efficacy of ECT.",

        "title": "Abstract P6-18-01: Novel genetic susceptibility loci for inflammatory breast cancer identified by whole exome sequencing",
        "abstract": "Background: Inflammatory breast  (IBC) is an extremely aggressive form of locally advanced breast  that affects approximately 5% of breast  patients. The prognosis of IBC patients is remarkably poor, with a three-year survival rate of approximately 30% compared to 60% for non-IBC breast  patients. The etiology of IBC is largely unknown. A few risk factors have been reported such as body mass index (BMI) and educational level. Prior evidence has also implicated genetic components in IBC etiology. For instance, the reported familial cases and racial incidence disparity of IBC patients, as well as the fact IBC patients typically have a younger age onset than non-IBC patients, all indicated the possible involvement of genetic factors. Nevertheless, as yet no genetic epidemiological study has been reported to evaluate IBC genetic predisposition.  Methods: To test the hypothesis that genetic variants and mutations may affect IBC susceptibility, we performed whole exome sequencing in a pilot case-control study that contained 70 IBC cases and 119 unrelated cancer-free controls. Sequencing data were de-multiplexed, filtered, assessed for various quality control metrics, mapped to reference genome and annotated. Comprehensive single variant-based, gene-centered, and pathway-based analyses were conducted to identify variants, genes, and pathways that may be involved in IBC predisposition.  Results: We obtained u003e 50x on-target sequencing coverage of the whole exome in u003e 90% of the patients. In single variant analysis, we identified six variants reaching genome-wide significance. Four variants were encoded by genes that have been implicated in breast  development including MALAT1, MAP3K9, POLR3B, and FIP1L1. Two variants were encoded by novel genes that have not been related to breast cancer, including CCDC30 and LINC01565. Two types of analyses based on a gene-centered strategy identified top genes such as SLC39A4, CDHR1, AP5Z1, GNB3, ITGA10, etc. However, possibly due to the limited sample size, none of these genes reached genome-wide significance. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), using the complete list of significant genes identified by each of these analyses all reported cancer as the highest possible disorder associated with these genes, demonstrating the biological plausibility of our findings. Moreover, canonical pathways such as IL4 signaling, glycogen degradation, epithelial adherence junction signaling, and CCR3 signaling in eosinophils were among the top pathways that were found involved in IBC predisposition.  Conclusion: Overall, we provided novel preliminary evidence that genetic variants are potentially associated with the risk of developing IBC. We are currently conducting validation studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm these findings and identify additional genetic susceptibility loci.

        "abstract": "Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an extremely aggressive form of locally advanced breast cancer that affects about 5% of breast cancer patients. The prognosis of IBC patients is remarkably poor, with a three-year survival rate of approximately 30% compared to 60% for patients with non-IBC breast cancers. These facts highlight the importance of accurate characterization, early detection, and timely treatment of IBC patients. Thus, it is important to develop novel and clinically applicable non-invasive biomarkers to characterize the unique presentation of IBC. In this study, we searched for somatic mutations in the circulating tumor DNAs (ctDNAs) that could be used to non-invasively characterize IBC patients and inform their clinical management. Using ctDNAs extracted from plasma of 10 pairs of IBC and non-IBC patients that were matched on major demographic and clinical variables, we conducted a high-depth target next-generation sequencing study that interrogated a comprehensive panel of 127 TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas)-reported cancer-related genes with u003e7000 uniquely designed and validated probes. Overall, we obtained u003e500x coverage in u003e80% of the interrogated regions, and u003e100x coverage in u003e97% of the regions. We found that Cu003eT mutations predominated in well-reported mutated genes such as TP53, PIK3CA, EGFR, and CDH1. Compared to non-IBC patients, IBC patients appeared to have a higher percentage of mutations in PIK3CA but a lower percentage in TP53. Interestingly, about 78% of mutated genes that were only detected in IBC patients encode zinc finger-related proteins, a family of transcriptional factors that have been implicated in IBC development. In comparison, about 43% of genes that were detected only in non-IBC patients encode proteins important to cell division regulation. Furthermore, network-based stratification (NBS) analysis of the mutation profile revealed clusters of IBC relative to non-IBC samples, indicating the potential of mutation profiling in identifying molecularly distinct subtypes of IBC patients. Preliminary longitudinal analysis of ctDNAs from three patients with multiple plasma samples indicated that de novo mutations in important genes including PIK3CA, RB1, and KRAS appeared in patient blood after chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy treatments. Moreover, the emergence of some of these mutations was temporally correlated with the responses of patients to the treatments they received. Overall, this study provides novel evidence that ctDNA mutation status may help to non-invasively characterize IBC tumors, and might also serve as a novel non-invasive marker to monitor treatment efficacy and prognosis of breast cancer patients. Future studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm our findings and identify additional clinically useful markers for the characterization and management of IBC and non-IBC patients.

        "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 100 schizophrenia (SCZ)-associated loci, but using these findings to illuminate disease biology remains a challenge. Here we present integrative risk gene selector (iRIGS), a Bayesian framework that integrates multi-omics data and gene networks to infer risk genes in GWAS loci. By applying iRIGS to SCZ GWAS data, we predicted a set of high-confidence risk genes, most of which are not the nearest genes to the GWAS index variants. High-confidence risk genes account for a significantly enriched heritability, as estimated by stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression. Moreover, high-confidence risk genes are predominantly expressed in brain tissues, especially prenatally, and are enriched for targets of approved drugs, suggesting opportunities to reposition existing drugs for SCZ. Thus, iRIGS can leverage accumulating functional genomics and GWAS data to advance our understanding of SCZ etiology and potential therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "Estrogen plays a critical role in the regulation of gap junctions between oocytes and granulosa cells in mammalian ovaries. G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) was identified as a membrane estrogen receptor, mediating rapid, nongenomic signaling events that might be responsible for the regulation of oocyte meiosis resumption and gap junction intercellular communications (GJICs). The present study aimed to determine the expression and localization of GPR30 and its role in oocyte meiotic progression and GJICs in goat cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs). Immunofluorescence experiments revealed that GPR30 was primarily located in the plasma membrane of cumulus cells and oocytes in goats. 17\u03b2-estradiol could promote oocyte meiotic progression, which was blocked by G15 (a selective GPR30 antagonist) but not ICI182780 (a nuclear estrogen receptor inhibitor) in the early stage of in vitro culture. The effect of 17\u03b2-estradiol on the GJICs was quantified by lucifer yellow (LY) microinjection and calcein-AM fluorescent dye diffusion. 17\u03b2-estradiol treatment of goat COCs resulted in rapid downregulation of GJICs. The transfer of calcein from cumulus cells to oocytes could be significantly inhibited by carbenoxolone (a known gap junction blocker), 17\u03b2-estradiol or G1 (a GPR30 agonist), and this inhibition could be reversed by G15 but not ICI182780, indicating that GPR30 mediates the effect of 17\u03b2-estradiol on the rapid downregulation of GJICs. 17\u03b2-estradiol also stimulated the serine 368 phosphorylation of connexin 43 (Cx43) when COCs were in vitro cultured for 4\u2009h, 6\u2009h, and 8\u2009h. More importantly, 17\u03b2-estradiol or G1 could separately promote the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) and Cx43 significantly when COCs were cultured for 4\u2009h. Furthermore, both ERK1/2 and Cx43 phosphorylation could be inhibited by G15 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 or by the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059, indicating that EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling was involved in these events. These results supported the hypothesis that GPR30 mediated 17\u03b2-estradiol-stimulated meiotic resumption and GJIC reduction in goat COCs. Thus, the present study provides novel insights into elucidating the mechanisms for steroid hormone action in the regulation of oocyte maturation.",

Our results showed that LH induced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation, mitogen-activated protein kinase3/1 (MAPK3/1) activation and CNP mRNA decrease in cultured bovine granulosa cells. Further study revealed that LH suppressed CNP expression via the MAPK3/1 signaling pathway, which was activated by the EGFR pathway. In conclusion, our research suggested that MAPK3/1 is involved in LH-mediated decrease of CNP and that this process is related to the EGFR and MAPK3/1 signal pathways. ",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Cryopreservation of cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) is important for reproductive medicine. However, the vitrified-warmed COCs have lower maturation rate and subsequent developmental competence compared with fresh COCs. The present study was aimed to evaluate the effects of supplementation of the maturation medium with C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) on the developmental competence of vitrified-warmed mouse COCs. Addition of CNP to the maturation medium improved the maturation rate and enhanced the developmental competence of vitrified-warmed mouse COCs. The reason may be that vitrified COCs led to a decline in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels. Furthermore, addition of CNP to the maturation medium elevated cGMP levels of the vitrified-warmed COCs. In conclusion, cryopreservation-associated lower maturation rate and developmental competence of COCs may be ameliorated by CNP during maturation culture after warming.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The identification of small molecular inhibitors, which were reported to promote the derivation of mouse and human embryonic stem cells (ESCs), provides a potential strategy for the derivation of domesticated ungulate ESCs. In present study, goat inner cell mass (ICM) derived cells in the double inhibition (2i) condition, in which, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAP2K) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) were inhibited by PD0325901 and BIO respectively, were characterized. The results showed that goat ICM derived cells in 2i medium adding leukaemia inhibitor factor (LIF) possessed a mouse ES-like morphology. But these cells had much compromised proliferation capacity, resulting in difficulty in expansion. In 2i alone medium, goat ICM derived cells possessed primate ES-like morphology. These cells expressed pluripotent markers and could differentiate into derivatives of three germ layers  in\u00a0vitro . However, these cells could not be proliferated in long-term (persisted for 15 passages) because of spontaneously neural differentiation. Additionally, goat ICM derived cells could be inducing differentiated into neural lineage  in\u00a0vitro . Although goat ESCs could not be established in PD0325901 and BIO alone medium, this derivation condition provides a useful research system to find signaling molecular those regulate early embryonic development and pluripotency in goat.",

        "abstract": "\ufeff\ufeffThis\ufeff\ufeff study aimed to investigate how 6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (BIO) increases the osteogenic differentiation of canine bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and the role of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in this process. We mimicked the effect of Wnt by adding BIO to the culture medium of BMSCs and examined whether canonical Wnt signaling positively affects the differentiation of these cells into osteoblasts. Canine BMSCs were cultured with 0.5 and 1.0 \u03bcM BIO under osteogenic conditions and then differentiation markers were investigated. It was found that BIO significantly increased the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the number of ALP-positive cells, the mineralization level and calcium deposits. Moreover, cells cultured with 0.5 and 1.0 \u03bcM BIO exhibited detectable \u03b2-catenin expression in their nuclei, and showed upregulated \u03b2-catenin and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta(GSK3\u03b2) phosphorylation compared to untreated cells. In addition, BIO enhanced the mRNA expression of osteoblast differentiation markers such as ALP, runt-related transcription factor 2, collagen I, osteocalcin, and osteonectin. In conclusion, BIO upregulated GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation and inhibited its activity, thereby activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway and promoting the osteogenic differentiation of canine BMSCs. The effect of 1.0 \u03bcM BIO on BMSCs differentiation was stronger than that of 0.5 \u03bcM BIO.",

        "abstract": "In vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes is an important assisted reproductive technology for infertility treatment and livestock breeding programs. Because of asynchronous nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation, the developmental competence of oocytes matured in vitro is compromised. C-Type natriuretic peptide (CNP), which has been proved to be an inhibitor of oocyte maturation, provides a new alternative to optimise synchronisation of nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation and improve developmental capacity of immature oocytes in vitro. To investigate the effect of temporary meiotic arrest mediated by CNP on maturation and subsequent development of immature oocytes, immature mouse oocytes from small antral follicles were temporarily arrested in meiosis by CNP (0, 5, 10 and 50nM) for 24h and then matured for 16h. CNP treatment significantly increased the oocyte maturation rate from less than half to above 80%. After IVF, temporary meiotic arrest mediated by 10 and 50nM CNP significantly improved fertilisation and blastocyst rate of oocytes matured in vitro up to approximately 55% and 30% respectively. Moreover, this positive effect of CNP was attributed, in part, to an increase in the number of mature oocytes with aligned chromosomes and a normal spindle. The present findings indicate the potential to use CNP to improve the efficiency of oocyte IVM.",

        "title": "Comparative genomic analysis of NAC transcriptional factors to dissect the regulatory mechanisms for cell wall biosynthesis.",
        "abstract": "NAC domain transcription factors are important transcriptional regulators involved in plant growth, development and stress responses. Recent studies have revealed several classes of NAC transcriptional factors crucial for controlling secondary cell wall biosynthesis. These transcriptional factors mainly include three classes, SND, NST and VND. Despite progress, most current analysis is carried out in the model plant Arabidopsis. Moreover, many downstream genes regulated by these transcriptional factors are still not clear.In order to identify the key homologue genes across species and discover the network controlling cell wall biosynthesis, we carried out comparative genome analysis of NST, VND and SND genes across 19 higher plant species along with computational modelling of genes regulated or co-regulated with these transcriptional factors.The comparative genome analysis revealed that evolutionarily the secondary-wall-associated NAC domain transcription factors first appeared in Selaginella moellendorffii. In fact, among the three groups, only VND genes appeared in S. moellendorffii, which is evolutionarily earlier than the other two groups. The Arabidopsis and rice gene expression analysis showed specific patterns of the secondary cell wall-associated NAC genes (SND, NST and VND). Most of them were preferentially expressed in the stem, especially the second internodes. Furthermore, comprehensive co-regulatory network analysis revealed that the SND and MYB genes were co-regulated, which indicated the coordinative function of these transcriptional factors in modulating cell wall biosynthesis. In addition, the co-regulatory network analysis revealed many novel genes and pathways that could be involved in cell wall biosynthesis and its regulation. The gene ontology analysis also indicated that processes like carbohydrate synthesis, transport and stress response, are coordinately regulated toward cell wall biosynthesis.Overall, we provided a new insight into the evolution and the gene regulatory network of a subgroup of the NAC gene family controlling cell wall composition through bioinformatics data mining and bench validation. Our work might benefit to elucidate the possible molecular mechanism underlying the regulation network of secondary cell wall biosynthesis.",

        "title": "Gene expression profiles deciphering rice phenotypic variation between Nipponbare (Japonica) and 93-11 (Indica) during oxidative stress.",
        "abstract": "Rice is a very important food staple that feeds more than half the world's population. Two major Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) subspecies, japonica and indica, show significant phenotypic variation in their stress responses. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenotypic variation are still largely unknown. A common link among different stresses is that they produce an oxidative burst and result in an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, methyl viologen (MV) as a ROS agent was applied to investigate the rice oxidative stress response. We observed that 93-11 (indica) seedlings exhibited leaf senescence with severe lesions under MV treatment compared to Nipponbare (japonica). Whole-genome microarray experiments were conducted, and 1,062 probe sets were identified with gene expression level polymorphisms between the two rice cultivars in addition to differential expression under MV treatment, which were assigned as Core Intersectional Probesets (CIPs). These CIPs were analyzed by gene ontology (GO) and highlighted with enrichment GO terms related to toxin and oxidative stress responses as well as other responses. These GO term-enriched genes of the CIPs include glutathine S-transferases (GSTs), P450, plant defense genes, and secondary metabolism related genes such as chalcone synthase (CHS). Further insertion/deletion (InDel) and regulatory element analyses for these identified CIPs suggested that there may be some eQTL hotspots related to oxidative stress in the rice genome, such as GST genes encoded on chromosome 10. In addition, we identified a group of marker genes individuating the japonica and indica subspecies. In summary, we developed a new strategy combining biological experiments and data mining to study the possible molecular mechanism of phenotypic variation during oxidative stress between Nipponbare and 93-11. This study will aid in the analysis of the molecular basis of quantitative traits.",

The genes that regulate salt stress in TM-1 upland cotton were monitored using microarray and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) with samples taken from roots. Microarray analysis showed that 1503 probe sets were up-regulated and 1490 probe sets were down-regulated in plants exposed for 3h to 100mM NaCl, and RT-PCR analysis validated 42 relevant/related genes. The distribution of enriched gene ontology terms showed such important processes as the response to water stress and pathways of hormone metabolism and signal transduction were induced by the NaCl treatment. Some key regulatory gene families involved in abiotic and biotic sources of stress such as WRKY, ERF, and JAZ were differentially expressed. Our transcriptome analysis might provide some useful insights into salt-mediated signal transduction pathways in cotton and offer a number of candidate genes as potential markers of tolerance to salt stress.",

        "abstract": "The cotton diploid species, Gossypium arboreum, shows important properties of stress tolerance and good genetic stability. In this study, through mRNA-seq, we de novo assembled the unigenes of multiple samples with 3h H(2)O, NaCl, or PEG treatments in leaf, stem and root tissues and successfully obtained 123,579 transcripts of G. arboreum, 89,128 of which were with hits through BLAST against known cotton ESTs and draft genome of G. raimondii. About 36,961 transcripts (including 1,958 possible transcription factor members) were identified with differential expression under water stresses. Principal component analysis of differential expression levels in multiple samples suggested tissue selective signalling responding to water stresses. Venn diagram analysis showed the specificity and intersection of transcripts' response to NaCl and PEG treatments in different tissues. Self-organized mapping and hierarchical cluster analysis of the data also revealed strong tissue selectivity of transcripts under salt and osmotic stresses. In addition, the enriched gene ontology (GO) terms for the selected tissue groups were differed, including some unique enriched GO terms such as photosynthesis and tetrapyrrole binding only in leaf tissues, while the stem-specific genes showed unique GO terms related to plant-type cell wall biogenesis, and root-specific genes showed unique GO terms such as monooxygenase activity. Furthermore, there were multiple hormone cross-talks in response to osmotic and salt stress. In summary, our multidimensional mRNA sequencing revealed tissue selective signalling and hormone crosstalk in response to salt and osmotic stresses in G. arboreum. To our knowledge, this is the first such report of spatial resolution of transcriptome analysis in G. arboreum. Our study will potentially advance understanding of possible transcriptional networks associated with water stress in cotton and other crop species.",

        "abstract": "While previous studies have shown that histone modifications could influence plant growth and development by regulating gene transcription, knowledge about the relationships between these modifications and gene expression is still limited. This study used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq), to investigate the genome-wide distribution of four histone modifications: di and trimethylation of H3K4 (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3) and acylation of H3K9 and H3K27 (H3K9ac and H3K27ac) in Oryza sativa L. japonica. By analyzing published DNase-Seq data, this study explored DNase-Hypersensitive (DH) sites along the rice genome. The histone marks appeared mainly in generic regions and were enriched around the transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes. This analysis demonstrated that the four histone modifications and the DH sites were all associated with active transcription. Furthermore, the four histone modifications were highly concurrent with transcript regions-a promising feature that was used to predict missing genes in the rice gene annotation. The predictions were further validated by experimentally confirming the transcription of two predicted missing genes. Moreover, a sequence motif analysis was constructed in order to identify the DH sites and many putative transcription factor binding sites.",

        "abstract": "Rice SPX domain gene, OsSPX1, plays an important role in the phosphate (Pi) signaling network. Our previous work showed that constitutive overexpression of OsSPX1 in tobacco and Arabidopsis plants improved cold tolerance while also decreasing total leaf Pi. In the present study, we generated rice antisense and sense transgenic lines of OsSPX1 and found that down-regulation of OsSPX1 caused high sensitivity to cold and oxidative stresses in rice seedlings. Compared to wild-type and OsSPX1-sense transgenic lines, more hydrogen peroxide accumulated in seedling leaves of OsSPX1-antisense transgenic lines for controls, cold and methyl viologen (MV) treatments. Glutathione as a ROS scavenger could protect the antisense transgenic lines from cold and MV stress. Rice whole genome GeneChip analysis showed that some oxidative-stress marker genes (e.g. glutathione S-transferase and P450s) and Pi-signaling pathway related genes (e.g. OsPHO2) were significantly down-regulated by the antisense of OsSPX1. The microarray results were validated by real-time RT-PCR. Our study indicated that OsSPX1 may be involved in cross-talks between oxidative stress, cold stress and phosphate homeostasis in rice seedling leaves.",

However, the exact influencing factors of AKI are still unclear and a predictive model is desperately required in the clinic.Data of 102 consecutive LTs were reviewed. A model for predicting AKI was established and further validated in a prospective study of 44 patients receiving LT.The incidence of AKI was 32.4%. AKI patients showed a significantly lower survival rate than non-AKI patients. Multivariate analysis demonstrated the independent influencing factors of AKI were preoperative serum creatinine >1.2 mg/dl, intraoperative urine output <or=60 ml/h, intraoperative hypotension status, and intraoperative use of noradrenaline. A model was then established and showed a sensitivity of 75.0%, a specificity of 93.8%, and an accuracy of 88.6% in predicting AKI.High preoperative serum creatinine, low intraoperative urine output, and intraoperative hypotension contribute to the development of AKI, and intraoperative use of noradrenaline serves as a protective factor. The predictive model could potentially facilitate early prediction and surveillance of AKI.",

So far, there are few reports on the effect of preexisting DM on outcome of liver transplant recipients with HBV infection.We aimed to examine the impact of preexisting DM on post-transplant outcome in Chinese patients with HBV-related liver disease.The post-transplant morbidities and patient survival were compared between 48 diabetes patients (DM group) and 96 non-diabetes patients (control group) matched for age, gender, primary disease and model for end-stage liver diseases score. The DM group was further divided into hyperglycemia patients (fasting blood glucose >8.0 mmol/L, n = 22) and non-hyperglycemia patients (fasting blood glucose \u22648.0 mmol/L, n = 26).Patient characteristics were comparable between both groups, except a higher incidence of hepatic encephalopathy in the DM group than that in the control group (22.9% vs. 10.4%, P = 0.045). The incidences of post-transplant complications and patient survival did not differ significantly between the DM and control groups, or between non-hyperglycemia patients and their matched case controls. Hyperglycemia patients showed a higher incidence of post-transplant sepsis (18.2% vs. 2.3%, P = 0.039) and biliary complications (31.8% vs. 6.8%, P = 0.012) than their matched case controls.Preexisting DM is not a contraindication for liver transplantation in patients with HBV-related liver disease. A tight control of blood glucose to a level of \u22648.0 mmol/L was necessary to reduce the risk of complications after liver transplantation.",

        "abstract": "The search for a strategy to provide temporary liver support and salvage the patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) remains an important issue. This study was designed to evaluate the experience in artificial liver support system (ALSS) combined with liver transplantation (LT) in the treatment of ACLF.One hundred and seventy one patients with HBV related ACLF undergoing LT between January 2001 and December 2009 were included. Of the 171 patients, 115 received 247 sessions of plasma exchange-centered ALSS treatment prior to LT (ALSS-LT group) and the other 56 received emergency LT (LT group). The MELD score were 31\u00b16 and 30\u00b17 in ALSS-LT group and LT group. ALSS treatment resulted in improvement of liver function and better tolerance to LT. The average level of serum total bilirubin before LT was lower than that before the first time of ALSS treatment. The median waiting time for a donor liver was 12 days (2-226 days) from the first run of ALSS treatment to LT. Compared to LT group, the beneficial influences of ALSS on intraoperative blood loss and endotracheal intubation time were also observed in ALSS-LT group. The 1-year and 5-year survival rates in the ALSS-LT group and LT group were 79.2% and 83%, 69.7% and 78.6%.Plasma exchange-centered ALSS is beneficial in salvaging patients with ACLF when a donor liver is not available. The consequential LT is the fundamental treatment modality to rescue these patients and lead to a similar survival rate as those patients receiving emergency transplantation.",

He was found hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 5 months after lamivudine resistance mutation and then received a successful hepatectomy. Three years later, hepatitis B envelope antigen seroconversion was achieved and nucleoside analogs were discontinued. After the withdrawn of antiviral treatment, HBV reactivated and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) occurred. Anti-HBV treatment improved the patient clinical condition. Three months after the remission of ACLF, the patient was diagnosed as HCC recurrence and received another hepatectomy. This case illustrates indefinite duration antiviral therapy and tight viral control should be performed in patients with HBV-related HCC.",

Seventy five rats were divided into 5 groups, administered N-nitrosodiethylamine (groups B, C, D and E) or natural saline (group A). Rats in group C and E were also given Huaier. At the 15 week sacrifice point, the HCC incidence of group C was lower than group correlating with serum AFP. The serum ALT concentration (98.9% greater) and P53 mRNA levels (23.2%) were higher in Group B than group C. Longer term survival rates between group D and E were not significantly different. Huaier can protect liver from chemical injury and furthermore HCC development, possibly with involvement of down-regulation of P53.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we used proteomic profiling to compare hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and peri-tumoral tissues to identify potential tumor markers of HCC. We identified eight differentially expressed proteins (u003e3-fold), including Peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6). PRDX6 is a bifunctional enzyme with both peroxidase and calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) activity. We found that peri-tumoral tissues expressed higher levels of PRDX6 mRNA (n\u2009=\u200959, P\u2009=\u20090.018) and protein (n\u2009=\u2009265, P\u2009u003c\u20090.001) than HCC tissues, and that decreased expression of PRDX6 in HCC tissues was an independent risk factor indicating a poor prognosis (n\u2009=\u2009145, P\u2009=\u20090.007). Combining the examination of serum PRDX6 with \u03b1-fetoprotein improved the diagnostic sensitivity of tests for HCC compared to \u03b1-fetoprotein alone (85.0% vs 50.0%, n\u2009=\u200940). We found that PRDX6 induced S phase arrest in HCC cells and inhibited HCC tumorigenicity in mice injected with cancer cells. When treated with H2 O2 , PRDX6 inhibited apoptosis. When treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), PRDX6 promoted apoptosis. Inhibition of iPLA2 activity of PRDX6 decreased the apoptosis induced by TNF-\u03b1. In conclusion, PRDX6 inhibited the carcinogenesis of HCC, and the iPLA2 activity of PRDX6 promoted cancer cell death induced by TNF-\u03b1. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The design of such super-repellent surfaces is still a major challenge of surface chemistry and physics. Herein, we describe a simple and efficient dip-coating approach for the fabrication of highly hierarchical surface coatings with superamphiphobic properties for a broad range of materials based on a mussel-inspired dendritic polymer (MI-dPG). The MI-dPG coating process provides a precise roughness control, and the construction of highly hierarchical structures was achieved either directly by pH-controlled aggregation or in combination with nanoparticles (NP). Moreover, the fabrication of coatings with a thickness and roughness gradient was possible via simple adjustment of the depth of the coating solution. Subsequent postmodification of these highly hierarchical structures with fluorinated molecules yielded a surface with superamphiphobic properties that successfully prevented the wetting of liquids with a low surface tension down to about 30 mN/m. The generated superamphiphobic coatings exhibit impressive repellency to water, surfactant containing solutions, and biological liquids, such as human serum, and are flexible on soft substrates.",

In this paper, we present for the first time a universal monolayer coating that is only a few nanometers thick and independent of the composition, size, shape, and structure of the substrate. The coating is based on a bioinspired synthetic amphiphilic block copolymer that combines two concepts from blood protein adsorption and mussel adhesion. This polymer can be rapidly tethered on various substrates including both planar surfaces and nanosystems with high grafting density. The resulting monolayer coatings are, on the one hand, inert to the adsorption of multiple polymer layers and prevent biofouling. On the other hand, they are chemically active for secondary functionalization and provide a new platform for selective material surface modification.",

In this work, hyperbranched polymer, hyperbranched polyglycerol (hPG), and conjugated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were assembled as complexes to serve as drug carriers. Herein, the conjugated polymer-MSNs interacted through the Schiff base bond, which possessed a mildly acidic responsive property. Interestingly, the assembled system could rapidly respond and release guest molecules inside cancer cells. This would make the entrapped drug released before the carriers escape from the endosome counterpart. The results show that the assembled composite complexes can be considered to be a drug delivery system...",

        "abstract": "Surfaces that exhibit extreme wetting properties such as superhydrophobic and/or slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) rely heavily on their surface energy and roughness. Although the bioaccumulation and dramatic ecological impact of perfluorinated building blocks are obvious, perfluorination of surfaces is still the most utilized method for lowering the surface energy. Herein we present a simple, substrate-independent, completely fluorine free and environmentally friendly concept for the construction of various super-wetting systems. Taking advantage of a mussel-inspired polyglycerol we successfully fabricated superhydrophilic, superhydrophobic and slippery surfaces by the precise design of a highly hierarchical structure. Additionally, the superhydrophobic coating was used to transfer commercially available cellulose and polystyrene 3D sponges into stable superhydrophobic but superoleophilic absorbent materials for oil/water separation. Moreover, the alkylated, hierarchical structure can serve as a matrix to efficiently capture hydrocarbon liquids as a lubricant that results in SLIPS. Surprisingly, common sunflower oil from the supermarket showed the same performance as pure chemicals such as hexadecane. Both the superhydrophobic and the slippery surfaces showed a similar performance regarding liquid and cell repellency in comparison to their fluorinated analog.",

To address this problem, we combined two separate biomimetic concepts of mussel-inspired adhesion and highly hierarchical lotuslike surface structures to develop a universal fabrication method for various superwetting systems on any kind of material. In this feature article, we summarize our work on mussel-inspired polyglycerol (MI-dPG) and its application in the area of superwetting interfacial materials. MI-dPG mimics not only the functional groups of mfp-5 but also their molecular weight and molecular structure, which results in strong and rapid adhesion to the substrate. Furthermore, the MI-dPG coating process provides precise roughness control. The construction of highly hierarchical and superhydrophilic structures was achieved either directly by pH-controlled aggregation or in combination with nanoparticles. Sub...",

Understanding the mechanism of the extraordinarily strong adhesive bonds of the catechol group will likely aid in the development of adhesives. With this aim, we study the adhesion of catechol-based adhesives to metal oxides on the molecular level using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The comparison of single catechols (dopamine) with multiple catechols on hyperbranched polyglycerols (hPG) at various pH and dwell times allowed us to further increase our understanding. In particular, we were able to elucidate how to achieve strong bonds of different valency. It was concluded that hyperbranched polyglycerols with added catechol end groups are promising candidates for durable surface coatings. ",

We have previously developed a thermoresponsive coating with glycerol based linear copolymers that enables gentle harvesting of entire cell sheets. In this article we present an in-depth analysis of these thermoresponsive linear polyglycidyl ethers and their performance as coating for substrates in cell culture in comparison with commercially available poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) coated culture dishes. A series of copolymers of glycidyl methyl ether (GME) and glycidyl ethyl ether (EGE) was prepared in order to study their thermoresponsive properties in solution and on the surface with respect to the comonomer ratio. In both cases, when grafted to planar surfaces or spherical nanoparticles, the applied thermoresponsive polyglycerol coatings render the respective surfaces switchable. Protein adsorption experiments on copolymer coated planar surfaces with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy reveal the ability of the tested thermoresponsive coatings to be switched between highly protein resistant and adsorptive states. Cell culture experiments demonstrate that these thermoresponsive coatings allow for adhesion and proliferation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts comparable to TCPS and faster than on PNIPAM substrates. Temperature triggered detachment of complete cell sheets from copolymer coated substrates was accomplished within minutes while maintaining high viability of the harvested cells. Thus such glycerol based copolymers present a promising alternative to PNIPAM as a thermoresponsive coating of cell culture substrates.",

Those merits are described and analyzed in this paper. It can be seen from analysis that a longer, wider magnetic core and wider coil width increase the coupling coefficient. A new circuit structure composed of LCL compensation and the buck circuit is also described in this paper. Current in the primary side of the circuit will vary with load demand. This way, higher efficiency can be achieved when power transferred is small. A 2kW prototype IPT system is built based on these techniques. When the air gap and lateral tolerance reaches 38cm and 40cm separately, the efficiency is acceptable.",

        "abstract": "Recently, a new strategy that controls generator rotor angle has appeared. The new control strategy can suppress inter-area low-frequency oscillations effectively without the help of any remote signal. It can also improve transient stability. This paper investigates the load balancing mechanism after rotor angle controllers are deployed. Analysis shows that the primary frequency control and automatic generation control currently used can be fulfilled in a new manner under this new control strategy. The generators can follow load demands quickly and precisely without the intervention of a dispatching centre. Consequently, the task of frequency control may be separated from the dispatching centre since the new control strategy is essentially decentralised and autonomous. Moreover, a load variation will be distributed to all generators that run in fix angle mode according to their distance from the load. Though power flow calculation is not needed during this process, it can be used to obtain generator outputs for any set of rotor angle aim values after loads change. Since generator rotor angle and the terminal bus voltage are given as inputs, the traditional Newton\u2013Raphson method must be modified before it can be used. Those modifications and some extra steps with generator output limits are also given.",

        "abstract": "The penetration level of distributed generation (DG) grows rapidly bringing more frequency fluctuation nowadays. Besides, the power system grows in size day by day; the assumption that the frequencies are the same across the grid is no longer valid. These all bring out problems to the frequency control mechanism currently used. The recently proposed rotor angle control strategy may solve these problems. Apart from suppressing low-frequency oscillations (LFO) more effectively, the new control strategy may also replace automatic generation control (AGC) presently used. The balance between generations and loads can be restored quickly and automatically after the loads change. No intervention from a dispatching centre is needed. However, the currently proposed rotor angle controller has an integration block. This will lead to negative damping torque for very low frequency input and frequent turbine valve adjustment. Removing the integration block from the controller can solve these problems. The control strategy will become a kind of angle droop control then. The rotor angle droop (RAD) control can also maintain generation load balance and restore frequency to rated value without the intervention of a dispatching centre since it is also decentralized and autonomous. Besides, the new strategy will distribute load variance (although not precisely) to generators according to their rated capacity.",

        "abstract": "In order to use remote wind power/solar energy, the scale of power grid interconnection grow rapidly. If transient stability can be increased when faults happen on tie lines, the transmission capacity can be increased too. Dynamic braking can increase transient stability by increasing deceleration area, but itu0027s difficult to coordinate several braking devices and calculate braking amount in real time. Things are no longer so after rotor angle droop (RAD) controllers are deployed across the power system. Since all rotor angles of generators will be fixed in rotating coordination system determined by global position system (GPS) pulse per second (PPS) signal, dynamic braking amount can be calculated by RAD controller by using local speed and rotor measurement. This paper shows the revised equal area criteria (EAC) when this kind of dynamic braking is used. The relationships between RAD controller parameter (saturation threshold) and the braking effect are also investigated. Simulation results in IEEE 68 nodes system show that, by applying dynamic braking on several generators simultaneously, critical clearing time can be increased dramatically when faults happen on tie lines.",

All the obtained polymers are thermally stable, losing merely 5% of their weights at temperatures higher than 367 \u00b0C. They exhibit higher refractive indices than some commercial plastics and can be crosslinked upon UV irradiation to generate a 3D photopattern with high resolution.

        "abstract": "The Cu(i)-catalyzed azide-alkyne click polymerization has become a powerful tool for the preparation of functional polytriazoles. However, copper residues in the products could harm the performance of optoelectronic devices and be cytotoxic in biological applications. The complete removal of these residues after reaction from the polymers is therefore necessary but difficult. The metal-free azide-alkyne click polymerization (MFCP) provides a solution to this problem. Currently, the MFCP is facilitated by activated alkynes, and no activated comonomer, i.e. azide, has been reported. In this paper, an activated azide, 4,4\u2032-diazidoperfluorobenzophenone, was designed and synthesized. Compared to the ordinary azide, such a monomer can remarkably accelerate the MFCP with alkynes. Thus, a new MFCP of activated azide and alkyne was established, and polytriazoles with high regioregularity (fraction of 1,4-isomer higher than 82%) and satisfactory molecular weights (Mw up to 34000) were produced in high yields (up to 95.1%). \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "Pentafluorophenyl (PFP) ester-functionalized poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs, P1, P2, and P3) were designed and synthesized in desirable yields and molecular weight by using organorhodium complexes as catalysts. Furthermore, these PFP-containing PPAs were used as precursors to prepare a series of mono- and dual-functionalized PPAs by the substitution of the activated ester moieties with functional amines. The structures of the PFP-containing PPAs and the derived functional PPAs were characterized by using multiple spectroscopic techniques including GPC, FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and 19F NMR. The experimental details and the characterization data demonstrate that activated ester synthetic route to functional PPAs is facile (just stirring the precursor polymer with proper amine(s) at room temperature for hours), efficient (complete transition from ester to amide has been confirmed), and quantitative (the relative content of a specific functionality can be precisely preset by controlling the feed ratio of the functional amines). By reacting three PFP-containing PPAs with chiral amines or with chiral and nonchiral alkyl amines in a step-by-step way, a series of seven different PPAs with asymmetric carbon in the side chains were obtained. CD measurements indicated that the incorporation of chiral amine into polymer side chains induced helicity formation of P1 backbone. P1-C*Ph(L) and P1-C*Ph(D) backbones adopt predominantly right-handed and left-handed helical conformation, respectively. While the flexible spacer between the chiral center and the rigid PPA backbone blocked the induction of main-chain helicity by chiral pendants, thus no CD signals were recorded for P2-C*Ph(L) and P3-C*Ph(L). Substitution of PFP ester with amine-functionalized PEGs transited the hydrophobic PPAs to hydrophilic. All of the PEG-containing PPAs can be dissolved in water and form clear solutions. Meanwhile, all of the aqueous solutions exhibit LCST behavior and the hydrophilic PEG chains and hydrophobic alkyl spacers have positive and negative impact on the cloud point, respectively. Contact angles measurements showed that the length and content of the PEG chains contribute greatly to the hydrophilic property, and the length of the alkyl spacers and the content of the alkyl amine component played a contrary role. By controlling the ratio of the PEGylated and alkyl amines, the amphiphilic property of the PPAs can be well tailored. \u00a9 2011 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "The primary thickening growth of Moso (Phyllostachys edulis) underground shoots largely determines the culm circumference. However, its developmental mechanisms remain largely unknown. Using an integrated anatomy, mathematics and genomics approach, we systematically studied cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the growth of Moso underground shoots. We discovered that the growth displayed a spiral pattern and pith played an important role in promoting the primary thickening process of Moso underground shoots and driving the evolution of culms with different sizes among different bamboo species. Different with model plants, the shoot apical meristem (SAM) of Moso is composed of six layers of cells. Comparative transcriptome analysis identified a large number of genes related to the vascular tissue formation that were significantly upregulated in a thick wall variant with narrow pith cavity, mildly spiral growth, and flat and enlarged SAM, including those related to plant hormones and those involved in cell wall development. These results provide a systematic perspective on the primary thickening growth of Moso underground shoots, and support a plausible mechanism resulting in the narrow pith cavity, weak spiral growth but increased vascular bundle of the thick wall Moso.",

        "abstract": "The principle of similarity (Thompson, 1917) states that the weight of an organism follows the 3/2-power law of its surface area and is proportional to its volume on the condition that the density is constant. However, the allometric relationship between leaf weight and leaf area has been reported to greatly deviate from the 3/2-power law, with the irregularity of leaf density largely ignored for explaining this deviation. Here, we choose 11 bamboo species to explore the allometric relationships among leaf area (), density (\u03c1), length (), thickness (), and weight (). Because the edge of a bamboo leaf follows a simplified two-parameter Gielis equation, we could show that  \u221d  and that  \u221d . This then allowed us to derive the density-thickness allometry \u03c1 \u221d  and the weight-area allometry  \u221d  \u2248 , where  approximates -3/4. Leaf density is strikingly negatively associated with leaf thickness, and it is this inverse relationship that results in the weight-area allometry to deviate from the 3/2-power law. In conclusion, although plants are prone to invest less dry mass and thus produce thinner leaves when the leaf area is sufficient for photosynthesis, such leaf thinning needs to be accompanied with elevated density to ensure structural stability. The findings provide the insights on the evolutionary clue about the biomass investment and output of photosynthetic organs of plants. Because of the importance of leaves, plants could have enhanced the ratio of dry material per unit area of leaf in order to increase the efficiency of photosynthesis, relative the other parts of plants. Although the conclusion is drawn only based on 11 bamboo species, it should also be applicable to the other plants, especially considering previous works on the exponent of the weight-area relationship being less than 3/2 in plants.",

        "abstract": "Pith cavity formation is critical for bamboo to overcome the bending force during its fast growth; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Multiple approaches, including anatomical dissection, mathematical modelling and transcriptome profiling, were employed in this study to investigate the biology of pith cavity formation in bamboo Pseudosasa japonica. We found that the corruption of pith tissue occurred sequentially and asymmetrically from the top-center of the internode down to the bottom, which might be caused by the combined effects of asymmetrical radial and axial tensile forces during shoot-wall cell elongation and spiral growth of bamboo internodes. Programmed cell death (PCD) in pitch manifested by TUNEL positive nuclei, DNA cleavage and degraded organelles, and potentially regulated by ethylene and calcium signaling pathway, ROS burst, cell wall modification, proteolysis and nutrient recycle genes, might be responsible for pith tissue corruption of Ps. japonica. Although similar physiological changes and transcriptome profiles were found in different bamboo species, different formation rates of pith cavity were observed, which might be caused by different pith cells across the internode that were negatively correlated with the culm diameter. These findings provided a systematical view on the formation of bamboo pith cavity and revealed that PCD plays an important role in the bamboo pith cavity formation.

The smaller SAM also results in the lower level of hormones such as cytokinin and auxin, and downregulates hormone signaling and the downstream functional genes such as those related to metabolism, which finally results in its dwarf and smaller diameter culm with lower biomass.

        "abstract": "As an ecologically and economically important endemic bamboo species, moso (Phyllostachys edulis) has been widely distributed in Southern China. In the paper, 20 fluorescently labeled microsatellite markers were used to evaluate the genetic structure of Ph. edulis including 34 representative populations (803 individuals) covering the geographic range in China. Moderate genetic diversity (H\u2009=\u00a00.376) and differentiation (Gst\u2009=\u00a00.162) were detected at the species level, with the majority of genetic diversity occurring within populations (84.55%). Bayesian model-based structure analysis and sNMF/ANLS-AS method revealed the presence of two and three clusters. When K\u2009=\u20092, majority of populations (except SX) were clustered together (C1). It implied that SX, known as an introduced and isolated founder population, significantly differed from other populations for distinct environmental selection and allele mutation with the proof of scarce outcrossing and relatively high frequency of private allele. While K\u2009=\u20093, two subgroups (C1a of 18 populations and C1b of 14 populations) were detected within C1. The C1b displayed as a belt-shape region with an east-west direction. It coincided with the extremely high artificial selection in C1b (lower genetic diversity than that of C1a) due to the intensive plantation in the last four decades. Our results implied that the population protection and germplasm collection of moso bamboo should be not only from representative populations in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, and other places with intensive cultivation in the east of China, but from populations with high level of gene and genotypic diversity in the west (e.g., HN5, GD1, GZ2, YN1, and SX).",

        "abstract": "Previous studies on the fast growth of bamboo shoots mainly focused on the entire culm. No work about the fast elongation of a single internode, which is the basic unit for the fast growth of bamboo shoots, has been reported so far according to our knowledge. In this study, we have systematically investigated the regulating mechanisms underlying the fast growth of a single bamboo internode of Bambusa multiplex. We discover that the growth of the internode displays a logistic pattern, and the two parts located in the bottom of the internode, one for cell division, another for cell elongation and each with a ~\u20091-cm length, comprise the effective zones for the internode growth. RNA-Seq analysis reveals a number of key candidate genes potentially involved in regulating the fast growth of bamboo shoots, including those in the hormone pathway such as auxin as well as the downstream target genes involved in cell wall development and cell division, were identified. Further analysis discovers that sugar plays an important role in promoting the fast growth of bamboo internodes through inhibition of BmSnf1. Mechanical stress is found to be involved in the triggering of the internode growth decrease through activation of the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by upregulating CaMs. Those results provide systematic insight into the biological mechanisms underlying the fast growth of bamboo shoots based on a single internode behavior.",

Since the number of targets to be detected is usually much smaller than the number of resolution units in the observation areas, the requirement of signal sparsity for compressive sensing (CS) theory is satisfied naturally. Therefore, a target detection method based on CS is proposed in this paper, which can obtain better target detection performance. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

X-ray studies showed that nickel atoms of both 1 and 2 exhibit distorted NiN3O3 octahedral geometry. In each crystal, intermolecular hydrogen bonds form a two-dimensional network structure. DNA-binding properties of these two nickel(II) complexes were investigated by using UV-Vis absorption, fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies and viscosity measurements. Results indicated that the two complexes can bind to calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) via an intercalative mode, and complex 1 exhibits higher interaction with CT-DNA than complex 2. Furthermore, the interactions between the nickel(II) complexes with bovine serum albumin (BSA) have been studied by spectroscopies. The results indicated that both complexes could quench the intrinsic fluorescence of BSA in a static quenching process. The binding constants (Kb) and the numbers of binding sites (n) obtained are 1.10\u00d710(5)M(-1) and 1.05 for complex 1 and 5.05\u00d710(4)M(-1) and 0.997 for complex 2, respectively. Site-selective competitive binding investigation indicated that the binding sites of both the complexes are located in site I of sub-domains IIA of BSA. Assay of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity of the nickel(II) complexes revealed that they exhibit significant superoxide scavenging activity with IC50=3.4\u00d710(-5)M for complex 1 and 4.3\u00d710(-5)M for complex 2, respectively.

        "title": "Catalytic N-radical cascade reaction of hydrazones by oxidative deprotonation electron transfer and TEMPO mediation",
        "abstract": "Compared with the popularity of various C-centred radicals, the N-centred radicals remain largely unexplored in catalytic radical cascade reactions because of a lack of convenient methods for their generation. Known methods for their generation typically require the use of N-functionalized precursors or various toxic, potentially explosive or unstable radical initiators. Recently, visible-light photocatalysis has emerged as an attractive tool for the catalytic formation of N-centred radicals, but the pre-incorporation of a photolabile groups at the nitrogen atom largely limited the reaction scope. Here, we present a visible-light photocatalytic oxidative deprotonation electron transfer/2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-mediation strategy for catalytic N-radical cascade reaction of unsaturated hydrazones. This mild protocol provides a broadly applicable synthesis of 1,6-dihydropyradazines with complete regioselectivity and good yields. The 1,6-dihydropyradazines can be easily transformed into diazinium salts that showed promising in vitro antifungal activities against fungal pathogens. DFT calculations are conducted to explain the mechanism. Synthetic chemists continuously strive for fast, selective and high yielding reactions under mild conditions. Radical reactions, especially the radical cascades, provide a potential access to such ideal transformations and have attracted considerable attention of synthetic community because of their typically mild conditions, short reaction times and high efficiency1, 2. Although various carbon radicals have been widely used in catalytic radical-based cascade reactions3, 4, 5, however, the chemistry of N-centred radicals in this regard remains largely unexplored because of a lack of convenient and general methods for their generation6, 7. Known methods for their generation typically require the use of N-functionalized precursors or various toxic, potentially explosive or unstable radical initiators. Pioneered by Nicolaou\u2019s discovery of the o-iodoxybenzoic acid-mediated conversion of N-aryl amides and carbamates into the corresponding nitrogen radicals8, the groups of Chiba9 and Lei10, respectively, developed two efficient methods for the generation of 1,3-diazaallyl and amidyl radicals by Cu- and Ni-catalyzed oxidative cleavage of N\u2013H bonds of amidines and N-alkoxyamides using O2 and di-tertiary butyl peroxide as terminal oxidants at high temperatures. Recently, Li11 and Chemler12 also independently reported the Cu- and Ag-catalyzed oxidative formation of amidyl radicals in the presence of stoichiometric MnO2 and Selectfluor reagents as oxidants. Despite these impressive advancements, the search for new efficient protocols for direct catalytic conversion of the N\u2013H bonds into the corresponding N-centred radicals under mild conditions has become an increasingly significant, yet challenging priority in the development of new N-radical cascade reactions. In recent years, the visible-light photocatalysis has been established as a powerful technique that facilitates selectively activating organic molecules and chemical bonds to indentify new chemical reactions under mild conditions13, 14, 15, 16. As the notable early studies by MacMillan17 and Sanford18 on neutral N-centred radical-mediated photocatalytic C\u2013H amination of aldehydes and (hetero)arenes, several promising visible-light photocatalytic protocols have been developed by other groups for generating N-centred radicals and C\u2013N bond formation (Fig. 1a)19, 20, 21, 22, 23. Despite their advantages, these methods require the introduction of a photolabile substituent at the nitrogen atom as a handle for photo-activation. The use of the visible-light photocatalysis in initiating strong N\u2013H bond activation and application in neutral N-centred radical-mediated catalytic cascade reactions have been, until recently, very limited. The Knowles\u2019 group recently reported an elegant combination of iridium photocatalyst and phosphate base for a direct homolytic cleavage of strong N\u2013H bonds of N-arylamides to access amidyl radicals by a concerted proton-coupled electron transfer, which allowed an efficient radical cascade reaction towards N-heterocycle synthesis24. Exploring new reactivity of N-containing compounds in the field of visible-light photocatalysis is an integral part of our recent ongoing research endeavours25, 26, 27, 28. For example, our group has recently developed a direct catalytic conversion of the N\u2013H bonds of \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated hydrazones into N-centred hydrazonyl radicals by visible-light-induced photoredox catalysis, which enables an efficient and mild approach to intramolecular alkene hydroamination and oxyamination for synthesis of 4,5-dihydropyrazole derivatives28. In this reaction, a highly regioselective 5-exo radical cyclization of an N-centred radical was observed. It should be noted that the groups of Han29, 30 and Chiba31 have also independently reported stoichiometric amounts of tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-mediated intramolecular cyclization of hydrazonyl radicals for pyrazoline synthesis. Inspired by these studies, we considered exploration of the reactivity of hydrazones in catalytic N-radical cascade reactions to assemble biologically and synthetically important dihydropyradazine scaffolds32, inaccessible using other thermal methods29, 30, 31, 33 or our own previous protocols. To this end, herein, we report an oxidative deprotonation electron transfer (ODET)/TEMPO-mediation strategy for direct N\u2013H bond activation and catalytic N-radical cascade reactions of unsaturated hydrazones (Fig. 1b). This mild protocol represents the first, to our knowledge, broadly applicable synthesis of 1,6-dihydropyradazines with good regioselectivity and yield, achieved by merge of visible-light photocatalysis and TEMPO mediation. To realize the target catalytic N-radical cascade reaction of unsaturated hydrazones as shown in Fig. 1b, several major challenges would probably be encountered, such as the controlled formal homolysis of the recalcitrant N\u2013H bond for the formation of the neutral N-centred hydrazonyl radical, regioselectivity of the N-radical cyclization step (for example, 6-endo and 5-exo, path a versus path b)34, 35 and selective homolytic activation of aza-allylic C\u2013H bond in C-centred radical intermediate. Notably, it has been recently documented by MacMillan36, 37, Knowles24, 38, 39 and our group28, 40 that the addition of a suitable Br\u00f8nsted acid, Lewis acid or base could facilitate some otherwise inaccessible photocatalytic event by weakening chemical bonds of reactants and co-catalysts or modulating their redox potential. It has also been demonstrated by L\u00f3pez and G\u00f3mez that complete 6-endo-selectivity over 5-exo ring closure in radical cyclization of C-centred radicals can be controlled by the radical property, substitution pattern at C-5 or ring strain of substrate34, 35. Quite recently, the MacMillan group also first integrated elementary hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process into H-bond catalysis, and achieved a highly selective photoredox \u03b1-alkylation/lactonization cascade of alcohols41. Based on these inspiring studies, we hypothesized that the aforementioned regioselective N-radical cascade reaction could possibly be achieved by merging visible-light photoredox with TEMPO-mediated HAT process, wherein the N\u2013H bond might be directly converted into the corresponding N-centred hydrazonyl radical through an ODET and the aza-allylic C\u2013H bond can probably be homolytically cleavaged by a suitable H-atom acceptor such as TEMPO42. To test the feasibility of this strategy, we initially conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the cyclization step of N-centred radical intermediates 1a-A, 1b-A and 1c-A with sterically and electronically diverse substituents at the 2-position of the alkene (Fig. 2a; see Supplementary Notes 1\u20133 for details). The energies given in this work are N-12//6-311+G(d, p)//B3 LYP/6-31G(d) calculated Gibbs free energies in chloroform. See the Supplementary Information for more computational details.)43. As expected, both 5-exo and 6-endo N-radical-mediated radical cyclizations are possible pathways. For example, the study showed that the 5-exo-trig radical cyclization of 1a-A with an activation free energy of only 8.8\u2009kcal\u2009mol\u22121 via 1a-TS1 is much more favoured than its 6-endo-trig variant (activation free energy of 13.5\u2009kcal\u2009mol\u22121; Fig. 1b). It was also found that 1b-A would undergo 5-exo cyclization through 1b-TS1 more feasibly than its 6-endo cyclization via 1b-TS2, as shown by their activation free energy (Fig. 1c, 7.5 versus 11.2\u2009kcal\u2009mol\u22121). Interestingly, the 6-endo cyclization of 1c-A with a phenyl group at the 2-position of the alkene moiety proved to be easier to accomplish through 1c-TS2, with a relatively low activation free energy of 8.7\u2009kcal\u2009mol\u22121, to give the C-centred radical intermediate 1c-C (Fig. 1d). Encouraged by these computational results, we proceeded to perform experimental studies with these substrates to explore the feasibility of the desired 6-endo radical cyclization. Under our previously developed visible-light photocatalytic conditions for hydroamination of \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated hydrazones28, substrates 1a and 1b indeed underwent 5-exo radical cyclization reactions smoothly to give the corresponding products 2a and 2b in 68% and 81% yields, respectively (Fig. 3a). These results also provided a solid support for the above computational investigations into these substrates. Interestingly, the reaction of 1c resulted in the formation of a complex mixture with a complete conversion (Fig. 3b). Careful analysis of the reaction mixture revealed that an inseparable mixture of products 2c and 3 can be obtained in 21% yield with a ratio of 1:0.9. Meanwhile, product 4 was also isolated in 16% yield, which might be formed through another radical cascade reaction between 1c and the reaction solvent CHCl3 via radical intermediate 1c-B. The structures of 2a-2c, 3 and 4 were fully characterized by their 1H and 13C NMR spectra and mass data, and compound 4 was further characterized by single-crystal X-ray analysis (see Supplementary Fig. 79 for details). Note that the biologically significant 1,6-dihydropyridazines of type 2c cannot be easily prepared using traditional methods33. These observations suggested that further optimization of reaction parameters might result in the exclusive formation of the desired 1,6-dihydropyridazines. Encouraged by these initial results, we continued to optimize the reaction conditions with 1c as a model substrate to further improve the selectivity and yield (Table 1). Inspired by the recently demonstrated wide applicability of nitroxides in organic synthesis and their unique properties44, 45, we initially focused on nitroxides as potential additives. Surprisingly, it was found that the addition of TEMPO (1.0\u2009equiv.) did not quench the reaction; instead, it resulted in a clean reaction and gave the desired 1,6-dihydropyridazine 2c in 89% yield (entry 1). Based on our blueprint of the reaction, we postulated that TEMPO might serve as a H-atom acceptor to abstract aza-allylic H-atom by an HAT process41. Then, we simply screened inorganic bases such as NaOH, Na2CO3 and Na2HPO4, and established that the base also played an important role in the reaction, with K2CO3 identified as the best choice (entries 2\u20134). With K2CO3 as the base, we also briefly examined several other common solvents and CHCl3 proved to be the best reaction media with tetrahydrofuran, MeOH, dimethylformamide and CH3CN giving relatively low yields (entries 5\u20138). Then, we evaluated the effect of photocatalysts on the reaction under otherwise identical conditions. Interestingly, the use of Ir(ppy)2(dtbbpy)PF6 as a photocatalyst provided comparable results, whereas organic photocatalyst Eosin Y was ineffective for the reaction (entries 9\u201310). It has been well documented that TEMPO can serve not only as a radical scavenger but also as an oxidant in transition-metal catalysis44, 45. Thus, we continued to test several other oxidants, such as K2S2O8 and 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (see Supplementary Table 1 for details). However, all the reactions with these oxidants resulted in a complex mixture without formation of any desired product, suggesting that TEMPO might act as a radical trap to abstract the \u03b1-hydrogen atom from intermediate 1c-C to facilitate the target N-radical cascade reaction pathway (entries 11\u201312). In the control experiments with CHCl3 or CH3CN as the solvent, only very little or no desired products were detected in the absence of photocatalyst, base, TEMPO or light; large amounts of starting materials remained intact, highlighting the critical role of all the parameters in the reaction (entries 13\u201316; see Supplementary Table 2 for details). Under the optimized conditions, we then evaluated the substrate scope of this transformation with a variety of \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated hydrazones (Fig. 4). First, we examined the effects of arene substitution using a wide range of \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated hydrazones 1c-1i. It was found that the reaction with various \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated hydrazones bearing electron-neutral, electron-poor (for example, Cl, Br, CF3) or electron-rich (for example, Me) substituents at the 2-, 3- or 4-position of the aromatic ring proceeded well to deliver the corresponding products 2c-2i with yields ranging from 61 to 85%. Notably, those aryl bromides are amenable to further synthetic elaborations through transition-metal-catalyzed C\u2013C coupling reactions. Product 2f was also characterized by single-crystal X-ray analysis (see Supplementary Fig. 79 for details). Moreover, 2-naphthyl substituted hydrazone 1j reacted well to afford product 2j in 86% yield. Considering the known medicinal chemistry, it is noteworthy that various heterocycles can be incorporated into the hydrazone substrates with no apparent deleterious effect on the reaction efficiency. For example, 2-thiophenyl and 3-indolyl substituted hydrazones were tolerated well to give the desired products 2k and 2l in 59% and 53% yields, respectively. More importantly, the substrate scope of the current protocol can be successfully extended to aliphatic \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated hydrazones. Thus, the reaction with a series of linear and branched aliphatic \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated hydrazones 1m-1r can undergo the radical cascade reaction smoothly under standard conditions, although with prolonged reaction times, to afford the products 2m-2r in 63\u201383% yield. The \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated hydrazone 1s bearing a styryl group also appeared to be viable for the reaction, producing a 70% yield of 2s. Remarkably, cyclic substituents, such as cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl groups, could also be easily incorporated into the 1,6-dihydropyridazine scaffold with high yields (2t-2v, 83\u201396%). Encouraged by these results, we proceeded to examine the scope of alkene moieties by incorporation of various substituents into the phenyl ring. As highlighted in Fig. 4c, the substitution patterns and electronic properties of the aromatic ring showed no apparent effect on the reaction efficiency either. For example, all the electron-releasing (for example, 4-Me, 2-Me and 4-MeO) and electron-withdrawing (for example, 4-F, 4-Cl, 4-Br, 2,4-2Cl) groups were well tolerated under the standard conditions, furnishing the expected products 6a-6g in 51\u201381% yield. Interestingly, during our subsequent biological studies with 1,6-dihydropyridazines 2- and 6-derived diazinium salts, it was found that such aromatic substituents at the 2-position of the alkene are critical to their antifungal in vitro activities. It should be noted that we did not detect any 5-exo cyclization products in all cases29, 30. To gain additional insights into the reaction mechanism, several control experiments were conducted with model substrate 1c (Fig. 5; see Supplementary Discussion for details). To further confirm the formation of C-centred intermediate of type 1c-C during the reaction, common radical trapping agents (PhSeSePh or 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol, BHT) were added to the reaction system to capture the radical intermediate (Fig. 5a). However, no trapping products were observed; instead, only the 1,6-dihydropyridazine 2c was produced and isolated in 85% and 83% yields, respectively. In contrast, without addition of TEMPO, the reaction with PhSeSePh as a radical trapping agent furnished a mixture of desired 2c and selenide-adduct 7 (61% yield, 1:4 ratio; see Supplementary Fig. 78 for details), and compound 7 should be formed from radical intermediate 1c-C and PhSeSePh (Fig. 5b). Then, we obtained the pure selenide-adduct 7 by semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography purification and re-subjected it to the standard reaction conditions without TEMPO (Fig. 5c). However, we did not detect any desired product 2c even after 24\u2009h and compound 7 remained intact, suggesting that selenide-adduct 7 should not be the possible intermediate for the formation of 1,6-dihydropyridazine 2c. To further determine the role of TEMPO, we also calculated the free energy of the subsequent transformation of C-centred radical intermediate 1c-C into the final product 2c via the minimum energy crossing point (MECP; Fig. 6)43. As shown in Fig. 6a, the computational results showed that the TEMPO might facilitate the conversion of the intermediate 1c-C into the final product 2c through a TEMPO-mediated HAT process, because the calculated energy barrier (\u0394E) for the aza-allylic hydrogen atom abstraction via MECP-I is only 18.8\u2009kcal\u2009mol\u22121. Moreover, the generation of product 2c is exergonic by 20.0\u2009kcal\u2009mol\u22121 compared with the intermediate 1c-C. Recently, a similar trapping of carbon radical and elimination of TEMPO-H process in the presence of base has been identified by Chiba\u2019s group as the possible pathway in TEMPO-mediated C\u2013H bond oxygenation of oximes and hydrazones46. Inspired by this work, another possible pathway involving carbon radical trapping/elimination sequence of 1c-C in the presence of base was also considered in calculation. As shown in Fig. 6b, the combination of radical 1c-C with TEMPO occurs through MECP-II, and the energy barrier (\u0394E) of which is 18.4\u2009kcal\u2009mol\u22121. Although this energy barrier is close to that of MECP-I formation (Fig. 6a), the formation of TEMPO-adduct 8 is endergonic by 19.3\u2009kcal\u2009mol\u22121 compared with 1c-C. Moreover, the activation free energy of subsequent deprotonation, which occurs via transition state 9-TS, reaches as high as 43.3\u2009kcal\u2009mol\u22121. According to these results, the sequential combination of carbon radical 1c-C with TEMPO and elimination process appears to be thermodynamically unfavourable. Moreover, we also intended to isolate the possible intermediate 8 upon ~50% conversion of model substrate 1c. Unfortunately, all the attempts met failure, although a trace amount of intermediate 8 was detected by the high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis of the the reaction mixture (see Supplementary Information). Another possible pathway for base-free elimination of TEMPO-H from 8 by direct radical elimination with C\u2013O bond homolysis is not considered as the stoichiometric base is necessary in our reaction system47, 48, 49. Taken together, although the calculation studies support the TEMPO-mediated HAT process as the likely mechanism for the transformation of C-centred radical intermediate 1c-C into the final product 2c, at present we cannot rule out the carbon radical recombination/elimination pathway (see Supplementary Figs 80 and 81 and Supplementary Notes 1-3 for details). More detailed mechanistic studies are curently underway in our laboratory. According to our blueprint for ODET activation of N\u2013H bond, the addition of K2CO3 proved be critical for the reaction as a base and this phenomenon was indeed observed during the optimization study (Table 1, entry 14). To further evaluate the role of base in these reactions, we continue to study the mechanism of N-centred hydrazonyl radical formation by luminescence quenching experiments, NMR and electrochemical analysis with 1c as a model substrate (see Supplementary Figs 82\u201386 for details). Stern\u2013Volmer analysis demonstrated that hydrazone 1c alone is unable to quench the excited state of *[Ru(bpy)3]2+ in dimethylformamide at 25\u2009\u00b0C, implying that the excited state ruthenium complex does not oxidize the hydrazone 1c directly. However, upon addition of K2CO3 as a base, a significant decrease of luminescence emission intensity was observed. In addition, the 1H NMR analysis of a solution containing both 1c and K2CO3 exhibited that the addition of K2CO3 resulted in complete disappearance of the signal of N\u2013H, suggesting that K2CO3 serve to abstract the proton of N\u2013H bond to generate nitrogen anion intermediate 1c\u2019 (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Information). Moreover, cyclic voltammetry data confirmed that the excited photocatalyst *Ru(bpy)32+ (E1/2*II/I=+0.77\u2009V versus SCE in CH3CN) is likely to be sufficiently oxidizing to oxidize the nitrogen anion 1c\u2019 (Epred=0.56\u2009V versus SCE) to generate the corresponding N-centred radical intermediate 1c-A (Fig. 7). Taken together, although we could not completely exclude the concerted proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism at the current stage24, 38, 39, the above results are more consisted with an ODET activation mechanism involving sequential deprotonation of hydrazone substrates by the K2CO3 and visible-light photocatalytic single-electron transfer (SET) oxidation. Ultimately, a plausible mechanism is outlined in Fig. 7 using 1c as an example. Initially, the \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated hydrazone 1c is transformed into anionic intermediate 1c\u2019 upon deprotonation, which is then oxidized to the N-centred radical 1c-A by the excited photocatalyst *[Ru(bpy)3]2+ through a SET process. Then, the key intermediate 1c-A undergoes a 6-endo radical cyclization to afford the C-centred benzylic radical intermediate 1c-C, which can be conveniently transformed into the final product 2c by an HAT process in the presence of TEMPO (path c). However, as for the transformation of C-centred radical intermediate 1c-C into the final product 2c, at the current stage, we cannot rule out the carbon radical recombination/elimination pathway that involves TEMPO-adduct 8 as the key intermediate (path f, see Supplementary Information). In the absence of TEMPO, the intermediate 1c-C can abstract a hydrogen atom directly from CHCl3 to give 1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridazine 3 (path d). Meanwhile, the intermediate 1c-C can also abstract a chlorine radical from chloroform to give rise to dichloromethyl radical and labile tertiary chloride adduct 12 intermediate50, which can undergo facile elimination to give the product 2c. Moreover, without addition of TEMPO, the intermediate N-centred radical 1c-A could also undergo a 5-exo radical cyclization (path a) to furnish 1c-B, partly because of the relatively small activation free energy difference between 1c-B and 1c-C (Fig. 2d). In the photocatalytic cycle, chloroform can regenerate the photocatalyst [Ru(bpy)3]2+ by an SET oxidation process with the concomitant release of the chloroform radical anion, which rapidly dechlorinated to give chloride ion and the dichloromethyl radical51, 52, 53, 54. The formation of a dichloromethyl radical in the reaction was also confirmed by the isolation of side product 4, resulting from the radical cross coupling between the dichloromethyl radical and 1c-B intermediate. To further demonstrate the synthetic potential of this method, a gram-scale reaction of \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated hydrazone 1c was conducted in the presence of 1\u2009mol% of photocatalyst under standard reaction conditions, and the desired product 2c was still successfully obtained in 74% yield after 48\u2009h (Fig. 8a). A key benefit of this photocatalytic radical cyclization strategy is that the \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated hydrazone starting materials are easily accessed from the corresponding \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated ketones and tosyl hydrazine. Thus, we examined the photocatalytic radical cyclization with \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated ketone 13 and tosyl hydrazine in a two-step one-pot process (Fig. 8b). Pleasingly, the desired 1,6-dihydropyridazine 2d was obtained in 67% overall yield. Recently, heteroaromatic N-oxides have been widely employed in transition-metal-catalyzed aromatic C\u2013H activation/functionalization reactions to access various valuable heterocyclic molecules55. We found that the present method could provide a new approach to the synthesis of pyridazine N-oxides. For example, treatment of 2c with m-CPBA as the oxidant resulted in the facile formation of pyridazine N-oxide 14 in a 70% yield that was also clearly determined by X-ray analysis (Fig. 8c; see Supplementary Fig. 79 for details). Moreover, it was then established that the 1,6-dihydropyridazine products can also be easily transformed into the corresponding biologically important pyridazines under mild conditions (2.0 equiv. NaOH in CH3CN at 80\u2009\u00b0C). As highlighted in Fig. 9a, the electronic and steric properties of the substituents on both of the aromatic rings showed no significant effect on the reaction efficiency. A series of substrates with electron-rich or electron-poor substituents worked well to give the desired products in good yields (15a-15d, 86\u201390% yield; 15i\u201315l, 81\u201389% yield). In addition, 2-thiophenyl and 2-naphthyl-substituted 1,6-dihydropyridazines reacted well to give the corresponding pyridazine products 15d and 15e in 90% and 94% yield, respectively. Remarkably, the 1,6-dihydropyridazines bearing alkyl groups such as isopropyl, tert-butyl and cyclohexyl substituents, were well tolerated to deliver the desired products 15f-15h in high yields (76\u201387%). It has recently been documented that the pyridazine derivatives, such as diazinium salts bearing a dihydroxyacetophenone core, showed promising biological activities against a variety of microorganisms (germs and fungi)56. Thus, we further attempted to transform a range of representative pyridazines 15 into the corresponding diazinium salts 17 and preliminarily explored their potential structure\u2013activity relationships (Fig. 9b). By refluxing a mixture of pyridazines 15 and 2-chloro-3\u2032,4\u2032-dihydroxyacetophenone 16 in acetone for 12\u2009h, a series of diazinium salts 17a-17e were easily obtained in 63\u201385% yield after a simple filtration. Over the past decades, the incidence of invasive fungal infections and the associated morbidity and mortality rates have risen remarkably due to the over-use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, serious medical interventions and immune deficiency disorders, such as AIDS57, 58. Despite recent additions to the antifungal drug family, the limitations of the current antifungal drugs involve narrow activity spectra, detrimental drug\u2013drug interactions and antifungal resistance, necessitating the development of new antifungal agents or leads. With diazinium salts 17a-17e in hand, we evaluated the in vitro antifungal activities of these compounds against eight human pathogenic fungi, compared with commercially available fluconazole. In contrast to the antibacterial activities reported for related diazinium salts56, our results demonstrated that some of these compounds showed promising activities against four common clinical pathogenic fungi (Candida albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. neoformans and C. glabrata; see Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 for details). These results also confirmed that the substitution patterns and electronic properties of the substituents at both of the phenyl rings are critical to their in vitro antifungal activities. Gratifyingly, the MIC80 values of most of the compounds (17b-17e) against C. parapsilosis, C. neoformans and C. glabrata (0.5\u20134\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121) were comparable to those of fluconazole, which should be valuable for our future biological studies. We have developed a novel ODET/HAT strategy, which we used to directly convert the N\u2013H bond of \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated hydrazones to the N-centred radical, and developed an efficient catalytic N-radical cascade reaction. This mild protocol represents the first, to our knowledge, broadly applicable synthesis of 1,6-dihydropyradazines with good regioselectivity and yield, achieved by the merge of visible-light photocatalysis and TEMPO mediation. The 1,6-dihydropyridazines could also be conveniently transformed into biologically important diazinium salts bearing dihydroxyacetophenone core, which showed promising antifungal in vitro activities against various fungal pathogens. Control experiments and DFT calculations have been performed to help explain the mechanism. Owing to the wide occurrence of various N\u2013H bonds, we believe that this strategy may find wide use for generation of other various N-centred radicals and new reaction developments with these reactive species59. Unless otherwise noted, materials were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. All the solvents were treated according to general methods. Flash column chromatography was performed using 200\u2013300 mesh silica gel. The manipulations for photocatalytic N-radical cascade reactions were carried out with standard Schlenk techniques under Ar by visible-light irradiation. See Supplementary Methods for experimental details. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on 400 or 600\u2009MHz spectrophotometers. Chemical shifts are reported in delta (\u03b4) units in parts per million (p.p.m.) relative to the singlet (0\u2009p.p.m.) for tetramethylsilane. Data are reported as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s=singlet, d=doublet, t=triplet, dd=doublet of doublets, m=multiplet), coupling constants (Hz) and integration. 13C NMR spectra were recorded on 100 or 150\u2009MHz with complete proton-decoupling spectrophotometers (CDCl3: 77.0\u2009p.p.m. or DMSO-d6: 39.5\u2009p.p.m.). 19F NMR spectra were recorded on 376\u2009MHz with complete proton-decoupling spectrophotometers. Mass spectra were measured on MS spectrometer (EI) or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS), or electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). High-resolution mass spectrometry was recorded on Bruker ultrafleXtreme matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization\u2013time-of-flight (TOF)/TOF mass spectrometer. 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 19F NMR spectra are supplied for all compounds: see Supplementary Figs 1\u201377. In a flame-dried Schlenk tube under Ar, 1c (117.0\u2009mg, 0.3\u2009mmol), Ru(bpy)3Cl2.6H2O (0.006\u2009mmol), TEMPO (46.9\u2009mg, 0.3\u2009mmol) and K2CO3 (61.2\u2009mg, 0.45\u2009mmol) were dissolved in CHCl3 (6.0\u2009ml). Then, the resulting mixture was degassed via \u2018freeze-pump-thaw\u2019 procedure (three times). After that, the solution was stirred at a distance of ~5\u2009cm from a 3-W blue light-emitting diodes (450\u2013460\u2009nm) at room temperature ~5\u2009h until the reaction was completed as monitored by thin-layer chromatography analysis. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate 20:1~10:1) directly to give the desired product 2c in 84% yield as a white solid.

        "abstract": "A cooperative catalytic system comprising a palladium/XPhos complex and 5-norbornene-2-carboxylic acid was developed. This system promotes a two-component annulation reaction, allowing the construction of tetrahydronaphthalenes and indanes that contain quaternary centers through consecutive Catellani-type C\u2013H activation and redox-relay Heck reaction. Inexpensive 5-norbornene-2-carboxylic acid acts as a catalytic mediator (20 mol\u202f%) in this process. This mild, scalable, and chemoselective protocol is compatible with a wide variety of readily available aryl iodides and alkylating reagents. Application of this method in a 4-step synthesis of opioid analgesic eptazocine is demonstrated. Preliminary studies underscore the future promise of rendering this Catellani/redox-relay Heck cascade enantioselective.",

The recombinant protein was expressed in  and can self-assemble into CNPs with diameter at 25-30 nm . A tandem repeat peptide epitopes (TRE) was prepared as control. Mice were immunized with CNPs, TRE and commercialized synthetic peptide vaccines (PepVac), respectively. The ELISA results showed that CNPs stimulated a little higher specific antibody levels to PepVac, but was significantly higher than the TRE groups. Moreover, the results from specific IFN-\u03b3 responses and lymphocyte proliferation test indicated that CNP immunized mice exhibited significantly enhanced cellular immune response compared to TRE. These results suggested that the CNPs constructed in current study could be a potential alternative vaccine in future FMDV control.",

        "abstract": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) are epizootic swine viruses. To detect and study the evolution of PEDV and PDCoV in central China (Shanxi, Henan, Hubei province), 70 clinical intestinal and fecal samples from piglets with severe watery diarrhea during August 2015 and June 2016 were collected, tested and analyzed. PEDV was more frequently detected by PCR than PDCoV. Phylogenetic analysis of S genes showed that the 10 PEDV strains from this study clustered into G2a (n\u202f=\u202f7) and G2b (n\u202f=\u202f3) groups. Additionally, the three G2b strains (PEDV S2\u25b3) contained the same specific 3\u202fnt deletion in S2 as other reference strains in G2b. Interestingly, complete genome analysis indicated that CH/hubei/2016 was closer to the US INDEL strain and G2a group. CH/hubei/2016 had one recombination event in S2 gene which may have resulted from AH2012-12 (from G2b group) and CH-ZMDZY-11 (from G2a group). Furthermore, 10 purifying selection sites in S gene indicated an adaptive evolution of PEDV in central China swine herds. These results suggested that Pandemic G2a and G2b are predominant PEDV genotype circulating in central China. In addition, the deletion and recombination identified in S gene suggested PEDV strains of central exhibited an evolutionary variety. However, whether these changes affect the pathogenicity and antigenicity of wild PEDV is unknown and is worth for further investigation.",

        "abstract": "Egg drop syndrome virus (EDSV) is an avian adenovirus that causes markedly decrease in egg production, and in the quality of the eggs when it infects chickens. Until now, EDSV virus-cell interactions are poorly understood, and the cellular receptor is still unknown. In the present study, we determined the atomic structure of the fiber head of EDSV (residues 377-644) at 2.74\u202f\u00c5 resolution. Structure comparison with the (chick embryo lethal orphan) CELO long fiber head and human adenovirus fiber heads reveals that the avian adenovirus may interact with the same attachment factor in a unique fashion. Based on the previous studies of CELO virus, we assumed that the chicken coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) may be the attachment factor. We then demonstrate that the chicken CAR serves as a cellular attachment factor for EDSV based on three lines of evidences. Taken together, the results presented here are helpful for further exploring the pathogenesis related to the interaction between EDSV and host cells, and may be used for vaccine development and intervention strategies against EDSV infection.",

Comparison to traditional machine learning algorithms shows the superiority of deep learning based approaches. CNN is leading the performance at identifying suicide-related tweets with a precision of 78% and an F-1 measure of 83%, outperforming Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extra Trees (ET), etc. RNN based psychiatric stressors recognition obtains the best F-1 measure of 53.25% by exact match and 67.94% by inexact match, outperforming Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Moreover, transfer learning from clinical notes for the Twitter corpus outperforms the training with Twitter corpus only with an F-1 measure of 54.9% by exact match.

        "abstract": "Building high-quality annotated clinical corpora is necessary for developing statistical Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to unlock information embedded in clinical text, but it is also time consuming and expensive. Consequently, it important to identify factors that may affect annotation time, such as syntactic complexity of the text- to-be-annotated and the vagaries of individual user behavior. However, limited work has been done to understand annotation of clinical text. In this study, we aimed to investigate how factors inherent to the text affect annotation time for a named entity recognition (NER) task. We recruited 9 users to annotate a clinical corpus and recorded annotation time for each sample. Then we defined a set of factors that we hypothesized might affect annotation time, and fitted them into a linear regression model to predict annotation time. The linear regression model achieved an R of 0.611, and revealed eight time-associated factors, including characteristics of sentences, individual users, and annotation order with implications for the practice of annotation, and the development of cost models for active learning research.",

        "abstract": "Developing high-throughput and high-performance phenotyping algorithms is critical to the secondary use of electronic health records for clinical research. Supervised machine learning-based methods have shown good performance, but often require large annotated datasets that are costly to build. Simulation studies have shown that active learning (AL) could reduce the number of annotated samples while improving the model performance when assuming that the time of labeling each sample is the same (i.e., cost-insensitive). In this study, we proposed a cost- sensitive AL (CostAL) algorithm for clinical phenotyping, using the identification of breast cancer patients as a use case. CostAL implements a linear regression model to estimate the actual time required for annotating each individual sample. We recruited two annotators to manual review medical records of 766 potential breast cancer patients and recorded the actual time of annotating each sample. We then compared CostAL, AL, and passive learning (PL, aka random sampling) using this annotated dataset and generated learning curves for each method. Our experimental results showed that CostAL achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC) score among the three algorithms (PL, AL, and CostAL are 0.784, 0.8501, and 0.8673 for user 1 and 0.8006, 0.8806 and 0.9006 for user 2). To achieve an accuracy of 0.94, AL and CostAL could save 36% and 60% annotation time for user 1 and 53% and 70% annotation time for user 2, when they were compared with PL, indicating the value of cost-sensitive AL approaches.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Although significant progress has been achieved in characterizing marine shale reservoirs, studies that are associated with marine-continental shale reservoirs, particularly quantitative characterizations of shale pore\u2013fracture, remain rare. In this study, 12 black organic-rich marine-continental shale samples were collected from seven wells that were recently drilled in the Upper Permian Longtan Formation in the Southern Sichuan Basin of southern China. X-ray diffraction revealed that clay minerals are the most prevalent component of shale, followed by quartz and calcite. Various pore types were classified and morphologically characterized from images that were obtained with field emission scanning electron microscopy. Shale total porosity, which was measured via mercury injection porosimetry, was between 3.1% and 7.5%. In addition, a pore-fracture interpretation model was built to calculate fractures and matrix porosity, including organic matter porosity, interparticle porosity of brittle minerals, and intraparticle porosity of clay minerals. The model was highly consistent with the measured porosity. Three key parameters were obtained to characterize the development of different types of matrix pores ( V  TOC \u00a0u003e\u00a0 V  Bri \u00a0u003e\u00a0 V  Clay ). Low-pressure N 2  and CO 2  gas adsorption experiments were conducted to analyze pore volume, special surface area (SSA), and pore-size diameter. The results of the analyses revealed that micropores and macropores (including micro-fractures) are the dominant pores of the Longtan shale reservoir and that micropores provide the dominant shale gas adsorption space. Furthermore, the effects of shale components on pore development, as well as the correlation among different pore structural parameters, were discussed. The results showed that the enrichment of total organic carbon and clay mineral content will benefit the development of the Longtan shale pore\u2013fracture system. Moreover, a good positive linear relationship existed among matrix porosity, pore volume, SSA, average pore diameter, and surface porosity.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The characteristics and influence on methane adsorption capacity of the pore structure of coals was investigated through an approach that integrates mercury intrusion porosimetry, low pressure N 2 /CO 2  adsorption, and field emission scanning electron microscopy. Shihezi Formation coal samples from the Panji Deep Area in Huainan Coalfield in Southern North China were adopted as the study subjects. The fractal features of heterogeneous coal pore structures were quantified on the basis of N 2  adsorption isotherms by using the Frenkel\u2212Halesy\u2212Hill (FHH) model. Pore structure and morphology characterizations confirm that Shihezi Formation coals developed with multiple pore types and heterogeneous pore structures, and the slit-shaped and ink-bottle-shaped pores are mainly distributed at the pore size interval of 3.3\u201310\u202fnm. Our coal samples present uni-modal and multi-modal pore size distributions, wherein multiple peaks are concentrated in the intervals of 0.45\u20130.55\u202fnm and 2\u201320\u202f\u03bcm. The major volumes from mesopores (2\u202fnm\u202f \u202f50\u202fnm) occur in the full-scale pore size distributions, revealing Shihezi Formation coals are mesopores and macropores rich. Micropores (pore diameter\u202f R  o,max ). The methane adsorption capacity of Shihezi Formation coals is largely independent of mesopores and macropores but is positively correlated with the pore volume and specific surface area of micropores. This correlation suggests that micropores provide the predominant sites for methane adsorption. The calculated values of pore surface fractal dimension  D  1  and spatial fractal dimension  D  2  are 2.440\u20132.610 (avg. 2.515) and 2.542\u20132.761 (avg. 2.650), respectively, suggesting that the pore structures of Shihezi Formation coals are highly complex and heterogeneous. The positive correlation between  D  1  and methane adsorption capacity reveals that high surface roughness of the pore structure is associated with high methane adsorption capacity. However, the irregular pore structure does not influence methane adsorption capacity.",

Thus far, characterization of DicB has been severely hampered owing to its potent activity which ceases cell division and leads to cell death. In this work, through fusing maltose-binding protein to the N-terminus of DicB (MBP-DicB), we successfully expressed and purified recombinant DicB that enabled in vitro analysis for the first time. More importantly, taking advantage of the reduced inhibitory activity of MBP-DicB, we were able to study its effects on cell growth and morphology. Inhibition of cell growth by MBP-DicB was systematically evaluated using various DicB constructs, and their corresponding effects on cell morphology were also investigated. Our results revealed that the N-terminal segment of DicB plays an essential functional role, in contrast to its C-terminal tail. The N-terminus of DicB is of critical importance as even the first amino acid (following the initial Met) could not be removed, although it could be mutated. This study provides the first glimpse of the molecular determinants underlying DicB's function. ",

In order to characterize MICU2 we screened a series of N-terminal and C-terminal truncations and obtained constructs which can be expressed in abundance, giving rise to soluble samples to enable subsequent characterizations. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS) revealed that MICU2 exists as a monomer in Ca(2+)-free conditions but forms a dimer in Ca(2+)-bound conditions. Unlike MICU1, the C-helix domain of MICU2 exhibits no influence on protein conformation in both Ca(2+)-free and Ca(2+)-bound forms. Furthermore, mutation of the first EF-hand abolishes the ability of MICU2 to switch to a dimer in the presence of Ca(2+), indicating that the first EF-hand is not only involved in Ca(2+) binding but also in conformational change. Our pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays suggest that, in addition to disulfide bonds, salt bridges also contribute to MICU1-MICU2 heterodimer formation. ",

In this paper, the black rutile TiO\u2082 with a particle size of approximately 5 nm was prepared in vacuum by the infrared nano-second laser sputtering deposition method. The study results indicated that the prepared black TiO\u2082 exhibited high light absorption from UV to near-infrared region. The lattice distortion and Ti were responsible for the upward shift in the valance band, and the oxygen vacancy states were determined to be located about 0.7-1.18 eV under the conduction band, narrowing the band gap of TiO\u2082 from 3.2 eV to 2.1 eV. Although the black TiO\u2082 exhibited strong adsorption effects within the full spectrum and had a higher free carrier density, the presence of excess oxygen defects resulted in a higher recombination rate of the photo electron-hole pairs, which induced a poor photocatalytic performance of the black TiO\u2082. This work facilitates the understanding of the mechanisms mechanism of black TiO\u2082 formation via laser ablation, and emphasized the need for the controllability and quantification of oxygen vacancies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Cellular membrane disruption induced by \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptides has been considered as one of the major pathological mechanisms for the Alzheimeru0027s disease (AD). Mechanistic studies of the membrane disruption process at a high-resolution level, on the other hand, are hindered by the co-existence of multiple possible pathways, even in the simplified model systems such as the phospholipid liposome. Therefore, separation of these pathways is crucial to achieve in-depth understanding of the A\u03b2-induced membrane disruption process. Our current studies, which utilize a combination of multiple biophysical techniques, show that the peptide-to-lipid molar ratio (P:L) is an important factor that regulates the selection of dominant membrane-disruption pathways in the presence of 40-residue A\u03b2 peptides in liposomes. Three distinct pathways, the fibrillation with membrane content leakage, the vesicle fusion, and the lipid uptake through a temporarily stable ionic channel, become dominant in model liposome systems with specific conditions. These individual systems are characterized by both the initial states of A\u03b2 peptides and the P:L molar ratio. Our results demonstrated the possibility to generate simplified A\u03b2-membrane model systems with homogeneous membrane disruption pathway, which will benefit high-resolution mechanistic studies in the future. Fundamentally, the possibility of pathway selection controlled by P:L suggests that the driving forces for the A\u03b2 aggregation and A\u03b2-membrane interactions may be similar at the molecular level.",

        "abstract": "The pH-low insertion peptide (pHLIP) inserts into membranes and forms a transmembrane (TM) \u03b1-helix in response to slight acidity, and has shown great potential for cancer diagnosis and treatment. As a lead, pHLIP is challenging to optimize because the mechanism of its pH-dependent membrane interactions is not completely understood. Within pHLIP there are multiple D/E residues which could sense the pH change, the particular role played by each of them in the protonation-driven insertion process is not clear. The precise location of the TM helix within the pHLIP sequence is also unknown. In this work, solid-state NMR spectroscopy is used to address these central questions. Tracing backbone conformations revealed that the TM helix spans from A10 to D33 with a break at T19 to P20. Residue-specific pKa values of D31, D33, D25, and D14 were determined to be 6.5, 6.3, 6.1, and 5.8, respectively, and define the sequence of protonations which lead to insertion. Furthermore, possible intermediate states which disrupt membranes at pH\u20056.4 were proposed based on tryptophan fluorescence quenching and NMR data.",

        "abstract": "In the environment of non-Gaussian background clutter without target signal distribution parameters, it is difficult to derive the likelihood ratio merit function of traditional multiple frame target detection algorithms. To solve this problem, a dynamic programming MFTD algorithm based on the accumulation model of conditional probability ration is proposed together with the analysis of its performance. In this thesis, problems in the traditional MFTD method have been analyzed. With the maximum of the targetu0027s state conditional PDF ratio as the optimal criteria, a recursive accumulation model is established according to this algorithm, which is then locally linearized by Taylor series expansion. And a linearized approximate function is adopted, instead of the likelihood ratio, during the recursive accumulation, so the clutter outliers can be restrained by making use of clutteru0027s feature of distribution, the recursive accumulation equations of MFTD algorithm based on local linearization are derived, under different non-Gaussian distribution. Through simulation experiments, comparisons between the algorithm and the traditional ones are made, which proves that such an algorithm enjoys better detection and tracking performances in the non-Gaussian clutter background.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon was successfully synthesized using block copolymers as precursor by a self-template method and subsequent KOH chemical activation. The self-template agent, polystyrene, promotes the formation of mesopores, which is favorable for the rapid transport of both electrons and electrolyte ions. The micropores of nitrogen-doped hierarchical carbons were then extensively developed by activation to provide large electrochemical double-layer capacitance. As the activation temperature increased from 600\u00a0\u00b0C to 900\u00a0\u00b0C, the specific surface area of the materials increased dramatically. Thus, the as-obtained nitrogen-doped hierarchical carbon (NHPC-800) possesses a high surface area of up to 2104.5\u00a0m 2 /g with nitrogen content of 5.79%. It exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 257\u00a0F/g at a current density of 0.5\u00a0A/g in 6\u00a0M KOH aqueous electrolyte as measured in a three-electrode system. Furthermore, the nitrogen-doped hierarchical carbon electrode exhibits excellent rate capability with 128\u00a0F/g remaining at 20\u00a0A/g and good cycling stability of 90.38% retention over 10,000 cycles in a two-electrode system. The tunable porous structure and effective nitrogen doping via block polymer precursor shed a light for designing advanced electrode materials for a high-performance electrochemical energy system.",

The two-dimensional hydroxide and graphene oxide nanosheets achieved nanoscale dispersion in the composites, with high interfacial interaction between each other. The as-obtained material exhibits a high specific capacitance of 782 F g\u22121 at 0.5 A g\u22121 and an excellent cycling stability with 94.1% retention at 2 A g\u22121 after 3000 cycles in a three-electrode system. To further evaluate the NiO/RGO electrode for practical application, an asymmetric supercapacitor NiO/RGO//AC was fabricated using the NiO/RGO as cathode and AC as anode. It exhibits maximum energy density of 32.5 W h kg\u22121 at a power density of 375 W kg\u22121 and even retains 19.78 W h kg\u22121 at 7500 W kg\u22121. This asymmetric device also shows a high cycling stability along with 92.7% retention after 3000 cycles, and is able to light up an LED bulb. The success of the NiO/RGO composite sheds light on designing advanced hybrid materials for next-generation supercapacitive energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents. However, the underlying mechanism of osteosarcoma carcinogenesis and progression remains unknown. In the present study, we evaluated the expression profile of miRNAs in osteosarcoma tissues and the adjacent normal tissues. We found that the expression of miR-422a was down-regulated in osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines. In addition, we observed significantly elevated levels of repressive H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 and decreased active H3K4me3 on the promote region of miR-422a in osteosarcoma cells and clinical samples. Furthermore, upregulation of miR-422a exhibited both in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor effects by inhibiting osteosarcoma cell growth and inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. We also found that miR-422a targeted BCL2L2 and KRAS and negatively regulated their protein expression. Furthermore, restoration of miR-422a and knockdown of BCL2L2 and KRAS promoted apoptosis and induce cell cycle arrest in osteosarcoma cells. Taken together, this study demonstrates that miR-422a may serve as a tumor suppressor in osteosarcoma via inhibiting BCL2L2 and KRAS translation both in vitro and in vivo. \u00a0Therefore, miR-422a could be developed as a novel therapeutic target in osteosarcoma.",

        "abstract": "Wear particle-induced periprosthetic osteolysis is the primary complication of the total joint replacement; however, no conservative treatment except for reversal surgery is available for this disease. During the past decade, Chinese herbal medicines have been widely investigated to inhibit osteoclast differentiation, which may exhibit the potential to treat wear particle-induced periprosthetic osteolysis. The present study was aimed at the investigation of the effects of forsythiaside on osteocytes. The current data revealed that the forsythiaside treatment notably inhibited the titanium (Ti) particle-induced inflammation through impaired NF-\u03baB signaling, thereby inhibiting TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. In addition, the in vitro study demonstrated that forsythiaside effectively prevented the RANKL-induced differentiation of osteoclasts and inhibited the expression of osteoclast-specific genes in osteoclasts via inhibition of the JNK signaling pathway. The in vivo study of Ti particle-induced implant-associated osteolysis indicated that forsythiaside could also inhibit osteoclastogenesis. In summary, forsythiaside could inhibit osteoclastogenesis and particle-induced inflammation, resulting in decreased secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. On the other hand, forsythiaside could inhibit RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and Ti particle-induced periprosthetic osteolysis via JNK, ERK and p38 signaling pathways. Both the abovementioned biofunctions of forsythiaside contributed to the implant-associated particle-induced osteolysis. Thus, forsythiaside can act as a candidate drug for the precaution of implant-associated particle-induced osteolysis.",

        "abstract": "Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor. Although cisplatin is the primary chemotherapy used in osteosarcoma treatment, the cisplatin resistance remains a big challenge for improving overall survival. The store-operated calcium (Ca) entry (SOCE) and its major mediator Stim1 have been shown to be implicated in a number of pathological processes typical for cancer. In this study, we showed that Stim1 expression was significantly increased in chemo-resistant osteosarcoma tissues compared with chemo-sensitivity tissues. Patients with Sitm1 expression exhibited poorer overall survival than Stim1-negative patients. Moreover, un-regulation of Stim1 expression and SOCE were also observed in cisplatin-resistant MG63/CDDP cells compared with their parental cells. Cisplatin treatment obviously reduced Stim1 expression and SOCE in cisplatin-sensitivity MG63 cells, but had no effects on MG63/CDDP cells. In addition, cisplatin resulted in a more pronounced increase of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in MG63 cells than in their resistant variants, which was evidenced by the activation of molecular markers of ER stress, GRP78, CHOP and ATF4. Knockdown of Stim1 using siRNA remarkably enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis and ER stress in MG63/CDDP cells, thereby sensitizing cancer cells to cisplatin. On the other hand, overexpression of Stim1 markedly reversed apoptosis and ER stress following cisplatin treatment. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Stim1 as well as Ca entry contributes cisplatin resistance via inhibition of ER stress-mediated apoptosis, and provide important clues to the mechanisms involved in cisplatin resistance for osteosarcoma treatment. Stim1 represents as a target of cisplatin and blockade of Stim1-mediated Ca entry may be a useful strategy to improve the efficacy of cisplatin to treat osteosarcoma.",

        "abstract": "Atropa belladonna is one of the most important plant sources for producing pharmaceutical tropane alkaloids (TAs). T1 progeny of transgenic A. belladonna, in which putrescine N-methyltransferase (EC. 2.1.1.53) from Nicotiana tabacum (NtPMT) and hyoscyamine 6\u03b2-hydroxylase (EC. 1.14.11.14) from Hyoscyamus niger (HnH6H) were overexpressed, were established to investigate TA biosynthesis and distribution in ripe fruits, leaves, stems, primary roots and secondary roots under field conditions. Both NtPMT and HnH6H were detected at the transcriptional level in transgenic plants, whereas they were not detected in wild-type plants. The transgenes did not influence the root-specific expression patterns of endogenous TA biosynthetic genes in A. belladonna. All four endogenous TA biosynthetic genes (AbPMT, AbTRI, AbCYP80F1 and AbH6H) had the highest/exclusive expression levels in secondary roots, suggesting that TAs were mainly synthesized in secondary roots. T1 progeny of transgenic A. belladonna showed an impressive scopolamine-rich chemotype that greatly improved the pharmaceutical value of A. belladonna. The higher efficiency of hyoscyamine conversion was found in aerial than in underground parts. In aerial parts of transgenic plants, hyoscyamine was totally converted to downstream alkaloids, especially scopolamine. Hyoscyamine, anisodamine and scopolamine were detected in underground parts, but scopolamine and anisodamine were more abundant than hyoscyamine. The exclusively higher levels of anisodamine in roots suggested that it might be difficult for its translocation from root to aerial organs. T1 progeny of transgenic A. belladonna, which produces scopolamine at very high levels (2.94-5.13 mg g(-1)) in field conditions, can provide more valuable plant materials for scopolamine production.",

Three ligand substitution modes in the complexes were found: (i) substitution took place on the two M atoms in cis -direction resulting in three bridging ligand compound (for 2 ); (ii) substitution occurred on one metal atom leading to unsymmetrical M 2 S 2 unit (for 3 and 4 ); and (iii) substitution occurred on the two M atoms in trans -direction to form a polymer (for 5 ). IR, NMR and CV of these complexes were measured. An existence of mixed valence metal atoms leading to charge transfer and alteration of electrochemical behavior for the complexes were discussed and the possible structure of polymer compound 5 was proposed.

Three different ligand substitution modes ( A , C and D ) and two kinds of planar M 2 S 2 -units were found in the complexes. Different modes lead to different structure conformations and electrochemical behaviors of the complexes. Keywords Substitution mode Mo 2 S 2 -unit W 2 S 2 unit Crystal structures Spectroscopy and electrochemistry 1 Introduction In 1984, thiolate ligands were reacted with Mo(CO) 6 (M=Mo, W) resulting in di-nuclear carbonyl complexes containing thiolate bridges, [M 2 (\u03bc-SR) 2 (CO) 8 ] 2\u2212 (M=Mo, W; R=Ph, Bu t ) with a planar [M 2 S 2 ] core [1] . These carbonyl complexes undergo reversible two-electron oxidation accompanied by metal\ue5f8metal bond formation [2,3] . Decarbonylation of [M 2 (\u03bc-SR) 2 (CO) 8 ] 2\u2212,0 and the subsequent reaction of its core [M 2 S 2 ] have attracted our attention because it may be useful for synthesizing a variety of multi-metal complexes that might contribute to understanding certain aspects of metal-enzymes. In order to investigate the reactivity of the [M 2 S 2 ] unit in the complexes, a series of ligand substituted dinuclear complexes such as the MeCN or PPh 3 -substituted compound, [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 6 (MeCN) 2 ] and [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 6 (PPh 3 ) 2 ] [4] , acetate-substituted complexes, [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 6 (RCOO)] \u2212 [5,6] , [{Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 6 } 2 (OOCCH 2 CH 2 COO) 2 ] 2\u2212 [7] , halide-substituted compounds, [Mo 2 (SPhCl) 2 (CO) 6 Br] \u2212 [8] , [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 6 I] \u2212 [9] and the DPPM substituted compound [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 6 DPPM] \u2212 [10] have been isolated and preliminarily investigated. The structure determinations indicate that there were three ligand substitution modes in these complexes. (i) The substitution may take place on the two M atoms with the substituting ligands on the different sides of the planar M 2 S 2 -unit, for example in MeCN-substituted compound, the so-called trans -substitution mode A ; (ii) the substitution occurred on two metal atoms with the bidentate substituting ligand located at the same side of the planar M 2 S 2 -unit, as in acetate-substituted compounds, the so-called cis -substitution mode B ; (iii) the substitution may occur on two M atoms by a mono-dentate bridging ligand, as in the halide-substituted compounds, the so-called bridge-forming substitution mode C . Recently we have obtained a thiolate-substituted Mo complex, [Et 4 N][Mo 2 (SPh) 3 (CO) 6 ] ( 2 ), as a new example of bridge-forming substitution mode C . Two other ligand-substituted Mo(W) thiolate carbonyl complexes, [Bu 4 N][Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 6 (S 2 CNEt 2 )] ( 3 ) and [W 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 6 (DPPM)] ( 4 ), have been discovered that adopt an unsymmetrical substitution mode D in which ligand-substitution has occurred on one M atom. Herein we report the synthesis, structure and spectroscopic characterization of new metal(I) thiolate carbonyl compounds: [W 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] ( 1 ), [Et 4 N][Mo 2 (SPh) 3 (CO) 6 ] ( 2 ), [Bu 4 N][Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 6 (S 2 CNEt 2 )] ( 3 ), [W 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 6 (DPPM)] ( 4 ) and [W 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 6 (DPPM)] m ( 5 ), and the possible structure of polymer complex [W 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 6 (DPPM)] m ( 5 ). Different substitution modes leading to change of configuration and differing electrochemical behavior of M 2 S 2 unit in these complexes were also discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and methods All experiments were carried out under nitrogen atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques and all solvents and reagents were dried and degassed before use. The compound [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] was prepared from [Et 4 N] 2 [Mo 2 (CO) 8 (SR) 2 ] reacting with I 2 according to the literature methods [11] . IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet-Magna 750 Fourier transform IR spectrometer or Digilab FTS-20E/D-V Fourier transform IR spectrometer. Elemental analysis was performed on a CARLD ERBA instrumentation elemental analyzer MOD 1106; 13 C- and 95 Mo-NMR spectra were measured on a Varian-Unity-500 NMR spectrometer with a solution of 2 M Na 2 MoO 4 in D 2 O sealed in a capillary (for 95 Mo-NMR measurement) as reference. For comparison, the 13 C- and 95 Mo-NMR spectra of the compound [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] were also measured. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed with a three-electrode cell using 0.1 M Bu 4 NBF 4 as the supporting electrolyte and acetone as solvent. The working electrode was glass carbon ( A =0.0804 cm 2 ), the reference electrode was an aqueous SCE separated from the sample solution by a salt bridge and the auxiliary electrode was platinum wire. Solutions were deoxygenated and blanketed with a nitrogen atmosphere and the potentiostat was a CV-B from BAS (Bioanalytical Systems). 2.2 Synthesis of [W 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] ( 1 ) A mixture of [Et 4 N] 2 [W 2 (SR) 2 (CO) 8 ] [12] (4.43 g, 4.1 mmol) and I 2 (1.05 g, 4.1 mmol) in 30 ml of CCl 4 was stirred at room temperature (r.t.) for 4 h. After filtering off the white residue, a dark green filtrate was concentrated to a volume of 5 ml by vacuum. To the concentrated filtrate was added 20 ml MeOH and 2.2 g of dark green micro-crystalline product [W 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] ( 1 ) which was obtained by filtration. The precipitate was washed with MeOH and dried in vacuum, yield 63%. Elemental Anal. Calc. for C 18 H 10 O 8 S 2 W 2 : C, 29.6; H, 1.2; S, 7.9; W, 45.4. Found: C, 29.9; H, 1.6; S, 7.6; W, 46.2%.

To the filtrate was added 0.3 g (0.47 mmol) [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ], and the resulting mixture was stirred at 40 \u00b0C for another 24 h resulting in red brown solution. This red brown solution was concentrated to 10 ml under vacuum, and then 20 ml MeOH was added. After cooling to 4 \u00b0C overnight, 0.24 g (0.29 mmol) of black microcrystalline 2 was obtained by filtration. The product was washed with MeOH and dried under vacuum.

The resulting mixture was stirred at 50 \u00b0C for half an hour and at r.t. for another 12 h. The red\u2013brown solution was concentrated to 10 ml and then filtered. To the filtrate was added 20 ml of isopropanol. After filtering off a small amount of precipitate and cooling at 4 \u00b0C for several days, a dark brown micro-crystalline product was collected, which was recognized as 3 by its IR spectrum. 2.5 Synthesis of [W 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 6 DPPM] ( 4 ) A mixture of 0.40 g (0.5 mmol) of [W 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] ( 1 ) and 0.19 g (0.5 mmol) of DPPM in 20 ml of toluene was stirred at r.t. for 24 h resulting in green brown solution.

The dark green solid product 5 was isolated by filtration, washed with toluene and dried in vacuum. Yield: 0.45 g. IR (KBr pellet): 2006(w), 1979(s), 1927(s), 1896(s) and some characteristic absorption of DPPM ligand.

Product 5 is almost insoluble in CCl 4 , MeCN, benzene, toluene, acetone and methanol, and is slightly soluble in CH 2 Cl 2 , Me 2 SO, cyclohexane and hexane. 2.7 X-ray crystal structure determination The crystal data and experimental conditions are given in Table 1 . All the samples were mounted on the glass fiber and coated with epoxy cement. The intensities of 1 , 2 and 4 \u00b71/2 C 7 H 8 were collected on an Enraf-Nonius CAD4 computer controlled kappa axis diffractometer. A total of 2513 (for 1 ), 3454 (for 2 ) and 7734 (for 4 \u00b71/2 C 7 H 8 ) were collected. Lorentz and polarization corrections were applied to the data. An empirical absorption correction (base on a series of psi-scans) was applied to the data. Relative transmission coefficients ranged from 0.663 to 0.998 (for 1 ), 0.949 to 1.000 (for 2 ) and 0.654 to 0.999 (for 4 \u00b71/2 C 7 H 8 ). The structures of 1 and 2 were solved by direct methods with moltan -83 program. A total of two atoms were located from an E-map prepared from the phase set with probability statistics: absolute figure of merit=1.04 (for 1) , 1.02 (for 2 ) and residual=5.82 (for 1 ), 8.67 (for 2 ). The structure of 4 \u00b71/2 C 7 H 8 was solved using Patterson heavy-atom method which revealed the heavy atoms. The remaining atoms were located in succeeding difference Fourier syntheses. Hydrogen atoms were located and added to the structure factor calculations but their positions were not refined. The structures were refined using full-matrix least-squares where the function minimized was \u2211 w (\u2223 F o \u2223\u2212\u2223 F c \u2223) 2 and the weight w is defined as w = F o /43.27 if F o <43.27 or w =43.27/ F o if F o \u226543.27 and w = w 2 if w \u22650.10, w =0.0 if w <0.10 (for 1 ); and as per the Killean and Lawrence method with terms of 0.010 and 1.0 [13] (for 1 and 4 \u00b71/2 C 7 H 8 ). The final cycle of refinement converged with unweighted and weighted agreement factors of R 1 =\u2211 \u2223\u2223 F o \u2223\u2212\u2223 F c \u2223\u2223/\u2211 \u2223 F o \u2223 and R w =[\u2211 w(F o \u2212F c ) 2 /\u2211 wF o 2 ] 1/2 . All the calculations were performed by using MolEN/PC [14] . The data collection of 3 was performed on a Siemens Smart CCD diffractometer with graphite\u2013monochromatic Mo\u2013K \u03b1 radiation. A total of 9146 refractions were collected and the data reductions were performed on a silicon graphics computer station with smart ccc software. The structure of 3 was solved by conventional direct methods ( shelxtl ) and was refined by the full-matrix least-squares method on F 2 data using a Silicon Graphics indy computer and local programs [15] . All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically; hydrogen atoms were located at idealized positions and refined with fixed isotropic thermal parameters. The final refinement converged with unweighted and weighted agreement factors of R 1 =\u2211 \u2223\u2223 F o \u2223\u2212\u2223 F c \u2223\u2223/\u2211 \u2223 F o \u2223 and wR 2 =[\u2211 w(F o 2 \u2212 F c 2 ) 2 /\u2211 w( F o 2 ) 2 ] 1/2 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis of the complexes and ligand substitution reaction The complex [W 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] ( 1 ) was prepared as the Mo-analog [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] [11] according to reaction ( Eq. (1) ): (1) [ Et 4 N ] 2 [ W 2 ( SPh ) 2 ( CO ) 8 ]+ I 2 \u2192 CCl 4 [ W 2 ( SPh ) 2 ( CO ) 8 ]+2[ Et 4 N ] I In Eq. (1) , [Et 4 N] 2 [W 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] (no W\ue5f8W bond) underwent two-electron oxidation by I 2 affording complex 1 with creation of W\ue5f8W bond. The choice of solvents is very important, non-coordinating solvents such as CCl 4 , toluene or hexane are suitable for preparing complex 1 in high yield. Coordinating solvents such as MeCN, DMF and DMSO lead to the formation of solvent substituted compounds ( Eq. (2) ). (2) [ M 2 ( SPh ) 2 ( CO ) 8 ] 2\u2212 + I 2 \u2192 Solvent [ M 2 ( SPh ) 2 ( CO ) 6 ( Solvent ) 2 ]+2 \u0393 +2 CO The metal(I)-complex [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] [11] reacted with thiolate ligand PhS \u2212 resulting in a triply bridged dinuclear Mo(I)-complex which was isolated as a tetraethylammonium salt, [Et 4 N][Mo 2 (SPh) 3 (CO) 8 ] ( 2 ). This substitution reaction ( Eq. (3) ), like the reaction of halide substituted complexes [8,9] , adopts the bridge-forming substitution mode C . (3) [ Mo 2 ( SPh ) 2 ( CO ) 8 ]+[ Et 4 N ] SPh \u2192 MeCN [ Et 4 N ][ Mo 2 ( SPh ) 3 ( CO ) 6 ]+2 CO In contrast to \u2212 SPh, \u2212 S 2 CNEt 2 , reacted with [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] in the presence of Bu 4 NBr affording [Bu 4 N][Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (S 2 CNEt 2 )] ( 3 ), in which the \u2212 S 2 CNEt 2 ligand chelates one Mo atom leading to an unsymmetrical Mo 2 S 2 core in the molecule ( Eq. (4) ). In this case, the reaction adopted a new substitution mode giving unsymmetrical geometry D . (4) [ Mo 2 ( SPh ) 2 ( CO ) 8 ]+ NaS 2 CNEt 2 \u2192 \u2212 NaBr Bu 4 NBr [ Bu 4 N ][ Mo 2 ( SPh ) 2 ( CO ) 6 S 2 CNEt 2 ]+2 CO Reaction of [W 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] ( 1 ) with DPPM unexpectedly formed an unsymmetrical substitution mode D product, [W 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 6 DPPM] ( 4 ), in contrast with the Mo-analog, [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 6 DPPM], which is a cis -substitution mode B product [10] . It is worth pointing out that if the ratio of [W 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ]:DPPM is 1:2, a less soluble DPPM-containing W\ue5f8S\ue5f8CO polymer ( 5 ), which possesses an IR spectrum very different from complex 4 , is obtained in high yield. So far the ligand substitution reactions of [M 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] (M=Mo, W) can be summarized as following Scheme 1 . It is worth pointing out that the axial M\ue5f8CO bond distances are longer than the equatorial ones in the structure of [M 2 (CO) 8 (SPh) 2 ] (M=Mo, W). This may imply that the axial carbonyls are easier to substitute than the equatorial carbonyls. Therefore, in the ligand substitution reaction, the ligands always replace the axial carbonyls first. In some cases, if the ligands have large steric bulk, the replacement occurs at the equatorial position. For instance, complex 4 , owing to the larger stereo-hindrance of DPPM than the S 2 CNEt 2 ligand in complex 3 , undergoes substitution at equatorial positions, and complex 3 adopted substitution at both axial and equatorial positions simultaneously (see next section). Interestingly, the reaction of [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 6 Br] \u2212 with S 2 CNEt 2 \u2212 ligand did not result in cis -substitution mode B product [Mo 2 (CO) 6 (\u03bc-SPh) 2 (\u03bc-S 2 CNEt 2 )] \u2212 but rather in the unsymmetrical substitution mode D product, complex 3 . The two phenyl rings of SPh \u2212 ligands in 3 are trans -relative to the Mo 2 S 2 plane in contrast with [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 6 Br] \u2212 in which the two phenyl rings are cis [8] . This means that the reaction is not a simple substitution of Br bridge by S 2 CNEt 2 \u2212 , but involves dissociation of the Br \u2212 bridge, a change of the arrangement of phenyl rings and coordination of S 2 CNEt 2 ligand. It is evident that according to its elemental analysis data, IR spectrum and solubility, 5 is different from 4 and might be a polymer of trans -substitution mode A product [4] . The acquirement of polymer 5 is significant because it makes possible to connect M 2 S 2 units in different arrangements by using special multi-dentate ligands. 3.2 Structures of 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and possible structure of polymer 5 The selected bond distances and angles of 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 are listed in Tables 2\u20135 , respectively, and the structures of 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 are depicted in Figs. 1\u20134 , respectively. All four complexes possess a planar M 2 S 2 -unit (M=Mo or W) with small change of dimensions shown in Table 6 . The structure of 1 ( Fig. 1 ) is centro-symmetric with the geometry around each W atom being a distorted octahedron with four carbon atoms from carbonyls and two sulfur atoms from two bridging SPh ligands. The geometry of the W 2 S 2 core is almost the same as that of Mo 2 S 2 unit in the Mo-analog, [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] [11] . Complex 2 is comprised of a cation Et 4 N + and a di-nuclear molybdenum anion with three thiolate bridges, [Mo 2 (SPh) 3 (CO) 6 ] \u2212 . As shown in Fig. 2 , the structure of the anion of 2 contains a [Mo 2 S 3 ] core (E) with a planar Mo 2 S 2 unit. As is listed in Table 6 , the dimension of the Mo 2 S 2 unit in 2 is contracted by 0.01 \u00c5 of Mo\ue5f8S, 0.08 \u00c5 of Mo\ue5f8Mo and 2.23\u00b0 of Mo\ue5f8S\ue5f8Mo than that in [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ], and the Mo 2 S 2 unit of 2 was slightly puckered with dihedral angle of 12.17\u00b0 between Mo(1)\ue5f8Mo(2)\ue5f8S(1) and Mo(1)\ue5f8Mo(2)\ue5f8S(2) due to the introduction of the third SPh bridge. For the third bridge, the Mo\ue5f8S bond distance is 2.592(3) \u00c5 and Mo\ue5f8S\ue5f8Mo angle is 67.66\u00b0. Around the [Mo 2 S 3 ] core, there are three carbonyls coordinated to each Mo I atom and one phenyl group linking to each sulfur atom. Two phenyl groups on the S atoms of Mo 2 S 2 plane are on the same side of the M 2 S 2 plane resulting in syn -configuration which is different from the anti -configuration in Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 . The structure of the anion of 2 could be described as face-shared bi-octahedron ( F ). It is worth noting that the axial Mo\ue5f8C (1.92 \u00c5) is shorter than the equatorial Mo\ue5f8C (1.97 \u00c5) in complex 2 , and both the axial and equatorial Mo\ue5f8C distances in 2 are shorter than that in Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 (2.05 and 2.02 \u00c5). This means that the carbonyls of 2 are more difficult to be further substituted. In fact, quartet bridge-compound or the other product resulted from further substitution of carbonyls of 2 are not isolated, at least in this reaction system, so far. Complex 3 consists of a cation [Bu 4 N] + and an anion [(OC) 4 Mo(SPh) 2 Mo(CO) 2 (S 2 CNEt 2 )] \u2212 . As shown in Fig. 3 , the structure of the anion of 3 possesses an unsymmetrical rhombic core [Mo 2 S 2 ] with two different Mo\ue5f8S distances (average Mo(1)\ue5f8S of 2.41 \u00c5 and Mo(2)\ue5f8S of 2.55 \u00c5). Around the core, there are four carbonyls coordinated to one Mo atom and two carbonyls and one dithiocarbamate ligand S 2 CNEt 2 coordinated to another Mo atom forming different coordination environments of the two Mo atoms. The whole geometry could be considered as an egde-shared bi-octahedron ( G ). Two phenyl-rings link to the sulfur atoms in anti -configuration relative to the Mo 2 S 2 plane. In terms of the different values of Mo(1)\ue5f8S(Ph) and Mo(2)\ue5f8S(Ph) bond distances in 3 and consulting the Mo(I)-complexes [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] (Mo\ue5f8S, 2.474 \u00c5) and Mo(0)-complex, [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] 2\u2212 (Mo\ue5f8S, 2.608 \u00c5), the two Mo atoms in compound 3 are obviously in different oxidation states and the oxidation state of the Mo(2) with four carbonyl ligands is between +1 and 0, and the valence of the Mo(1) atom with S 2 CNEt 2 ligand is higher than +1. This indicates that the unsymmetric substitution mode resulting from the introduction of dithiocarbamate ligand leads to a Mo(1) \u2192 Mo(2) charge transfer and formation of a mixed valence complex. The S 2 CNEt 2 ligand replaces one axial carbonyl and one equatorial carbonyl on a Mo atom in 3 rather than bridges two Mo atoms. The S 2 CNEt 2 ligand in 3 is evidently a conjugate system in terms of the C\ue5f8N of 1.34 \u00c5 (between single and double bonds), CNC of ca. 120\u00b0, SCN of 122\u00b0 and SCS of 114\u00b0. The complex 4 , [W 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 6 (DPPM)], also contains an unsymmetrical rhombic W 2 S 2 unit with W(1)\ue5f8S of 2.55 \u00c5, W(2)\ue5f8S of 2.43 \u00c5 and W(1)\ue5f8W(2) of 2.996 \u00c5 ( Table 6 ). The whole structure of 4 is similar to that of the anion of complex 3 except for the different coordination positions of DPPM and S 2 CNEt 2 . The DPPM coordinates to two equatorial positions of one W atom in 4 ( Fig. 4 ) and the S 2 CNEt 2 coordinates to one axial and one equatorial positions of one Mo atom in 3 ( Fig. 3 ). This is obviously due to the larger steric demand of DPPM compared to S 2 CNEt 2 . DPPM not only can coordinate to two equatorial positions of one metal atom but also can bridge two metal atoms in axial positions if the steric hindrance could be effectively reduced in the final product. In fact, the Mo compound with DPPM bridge, [Mo 2 (\u03bc-SPh) 2 (CO) 6 (\u03bc-DPPM)], in which the phenyl rings are in syn -arrangement relative to Mo 2 S 2 unit plane, have been isolated [10] . In examining the W\ue5f8S bond distances of W(0)-complex, [W 2 (SCH 2 CO 2 Me) 2 (CO) 8 ] 2\u2212 (2.58 \u00c5) [16] , [W 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] 2\u2212 (2.59 \u00c5) [17] and W(I)-complex 1 (2.47 \u00c5), it can be found that, similar to complex 3 , the oxidation state of W(2) attached to the DPPM ligand (>+1) is higher than the valence of W 1 with four carbonyls (>0 and <+1) in complex 4 . Apparently, there is a W(1) \u2192 W(2) charge transfer in 4 because of the introduction of the DPPM ligand. In contrast to bridge-forming substitution mode C , the unsymmetrical substitution mode D leads to slight expansion of the M 2 S 2 core by ca. 0.05 \u00c5 of M\ue5f8M, ca. 0.02 \u00c5 of M\ue5f8S bond distances and ca. 0.35\u00b0 of MSM angle. It is worth pointing out that the carbonyls of Mo(CO) 4 -unit in 3 and W(CO) 4 in 4 seem to be further substituted by ligands because the Mo(CO) 4 -unit in 3 and the W(CO) 4 -unit in 4 are very similar to that in parent compounds, [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] and [W 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] ( 1 ), respectively, but neither [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 4 (S 2 CNEt 2 ) 2 ] 2\u2212 and [W 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 4 (DPPM) 2 ] nor other metal carbonyl-thiolates with multi-S 2 CNEt 2 or DPPM ligands have been isolated even if an excess ligands were used in the reaction. This is obviously due to the decreasing stability of the product with multi-ligand and less of carbonyls. According to the elemental analysis data of 5 and the similarity of the IR spectra of 5 and a trans -substitution mode A product, [M 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 6 (PPh 3 ) 2 ] ( \u03bd CO , 2010(m), 1980(s), 1940(s) and 1905(s) cm \u22121 ) [4] in which the P atoms of PPh 3 ligands coordinate to two M atoms, the compound 5 could be assumed as a polymer [(OC) 3 W(SPh) 2 W(CO) 3 DPPM] m in which the two phosphor atoms of DPPM coordinated to two W atoms in two different [(OC) 3 W(SPh) 2 W(CO) 3 ] units forming an infinite chain product although the structure of 5 has not been determined because of its lesser solubility and difficulty to obtain good quality of crystal. 3.3 IR, NMR and cyclic voltammetry The selected IR data of complexes 1 \u2013 5 are listed in Table 7 . It is easy to find that the \u03bd MC\ue5f8O in substituted complexes 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 are lower than that in parent complexes 1 and [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ], and \u03bd M\ue5f8S of the ligand substituted complexes are higher than that of parent complexes. The lower \u03bd MC\ue5f8O of 1799 and 1840 cm \u22121 in complexes 3 and 4 , respectively are found in the M(0)-compounds [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] 2\u2212 and [W 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] 2\u2212 (1770\u20131790) [1,3,17,18] indicating the existence of a metal-carbonyl unit similar to M 0 (CO) 4 -unit. In fact, the X-ray crystal structure showed that the Mo(CO) 4 - and W(CO) 4 -units in 3 and 4 , respectively, are similar to that in [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] 2\u2212 [3] and [W 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] 2\u2212 [17] . The 1 H- and 13 C-NMR of the ligand substituted complexes have been measured and focused on the benzene rings ( Table 8 ). The 1 H- and 13 C-NMR of the PhS ligands in ligand-substituted complexes are observed at 7.14\u20137.76 and 125.7\u2013148.3 ppm, respectively, which are similar to that in the parent complex 1 and [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ]. Complex 2 contains two sets of \u03b4 ( 1 H) and \u03b4 ( 13 C) indicating two kinds of Ph-groups in different environment. This is consistent with the result from the X-ray crystal structural data of 2 . Inspecting the 95 Mo-NMR, it can be found that there are two \u03b4 ( 95 Mo) for complex 3 . This implies that complex 3 exists with two kinds of Mo atoms in different coordination environment and oxidation states. The cyclic voltammograms of 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 are showed in Fig. 5 and the selected CV data are listed in Table 9 . As is reported before, complex 1 and [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] underwent reversible two-electron reduction at \u22120.35 V vs SCE (\u22120.4/\u22120.3 V vs SCE) [1,12] and the current parameter ( I Pa / \u03bd i /2 AC) of complex 1 and [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] are 1475 and 1240 A cm s 1/2 \u03bd \u2212 i /2 mol \u22121 , respectively, ( Fig. 5 a and b, Table 9 ). Their electrochemical reaction could be described as following Eq. (a) : (a) [ M 2 ( SPh ) 2 ( CO ) 8 ] 0 \u21cc \u22120.40 V 2e \u2212 [ M 2 ( SPh ) 2 ( CO ) 8 ] 2\u2212 ( M = M , W ) As is shown in Fig. 5 c, the complex 2 underwent a reversible reduction at \u22120.818(\u22120.865/\u22120.770) V vs SCE, with I Pc / I Pa \u22481. Its current parameter ( I Pa / \u03bd 1/2 AC) of 1121 A cm s 1/2 \u03bd \u22121/2 mol \u22121 is about twice as much as that of ferrocene (688 A cm s 1/2 \u03bd \u22121/2 mol \u22121 obtained in identical conditions). Ferrocene is known to undergo one-electron redox, thus, complex 2 should undergo reversible two-electron reduction at \u22120.818 V as described in following Eq. (b) : (b) [ Mo 2 ( SPh ) 3 ( CO ) 6 ] \u2212 \u21cc \u22120.865 V 2e \u2212 [ Mo 2 ( SPh ) 3 ( CO ) 6 ] 3\u2212 The electrochemical behavior of complex 2 is consistent with that of [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 6 (MeCN) 2 ] (0.8 V vs. SCE), which is a substitution mode A product. The cyclic voltammogram of complex 4 , as shown in Fig. 5 d, contained two redox couples at \u22120.383 and \u22120.747 V vs SCE with I Pc / I Pa \u22481 and their current parameters are 551 and 531 A cm s 1/2 \u03bd \u22121/2 mol \u22121 . This means that complex 4 undergoes quasi-reversible one-electron redox at \u22120.383 and \u22120.747 V vs SCE. This behavior could be expressed as following Eq. (c) : (c) [ W 2 ( SPh ) 2 ( CO ) 6 DPPM ] 0 \u21cc \u22120.383 V e \u2212 { W 2 ( SPh ) 2 ( CO ) 6 DPPM } \u2212 \u21cc \u22120.747 V e \u2212 [ W 2 ( SPh ) 2 ( CO ) 6 DPPM ] 2\u2212 According to the fact that the complex 4 contains two W atoms in different coordination environment: a lower valence tungsten atom (W L ) in W(CO) 4 -unit and a higher valence tungsten atom (W H ) in W(CO) 2 (DPPM)-unit (0< L <+1 and +1< H <+2), it is reasonable to speculate that the different redox event occurs on the different W metal centers. When the scan goes to negative potential the one-electron reduction, at first, occurs on the higher valence W H center, at \u22120.383 V, and then occurs on the lower valence W L center at \u22120.747 V. Inspecting the changes of CV behavior for ligand substituted complexes with different substitution modes it is clear to be found that the two-electron transfer character of the complexes [M 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] 2\u2212,0 (M=Mo, W) is not only dependent upon the planarity but also the symmetry of the M 2 S 2 -unit in the complexes. Complex 2 still keeps the two-electron transfer character because of its remaining the planarity and symmetry of the Mo 2 S 2 -unit. Complex 4 no longer possesses two-electron transfer character for its planar W 2 S 2 -unit lost symmetry. Complex 3 exhibited somewhat more complicated CV behavior implying some decomposition of the sample. However, obviously, complex 3 does not possess two-electron transfer character because of the same reason as complex 4 . 4 Summary Four new dinuclear M(I) complexes (M=Mo or W), [W 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] ( 1 ), [Mo 2 (SPh) 3 (CO) 6 ] \u2212 ( 2 ), [Mo 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 6 (S 2 CNEt 2 )] \u2212 ( 3 ) and [W 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 6 (DPPM)] ( 4 ) and a polymer [W 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 6 (DPPM)] m ( 5) were synthesized by the reaction of [M 2 (SPh) 2 (CO) 8 ] (M=Mo, W) with appropriate ligands and reaction conditions. The complexes were studied by crystal structure determination, IR, NMR and CV measurement. Three ligand substitution modes ( trans -substitution mode A , bridge-forming substitution mode C and unsymmetrical substitution mode D ) and two kinds of planar M 2 S 2 -units (symmetrical and unsymmetrical) were found in the complexes. Modes A and C make the complexes possess two-electron transfer character and mode D leads to formation of mixed valence metal atoms and lose of two-electron transfer character. 5 Supplementary material Crystallographic data for the structural analysis have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, CCDC no. 165472, 165471, 165583 and 165470 for compounds 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 , respectively.

Three ligand substitution modes in the complexes were found: (i) substitution took place on the two M atoms in cis-direction resulting in three bridging ligand compound (for 2); (ii) substitution occurred on one metal atom leading to unsymmetrical M2S2 unit (for 3 and 4); and (iii) substitution occurred on the two M atoms in trans-direction to form a polymer (for 5).

        "abstract": "Trichophyton mentagrophytes is a fungus that causes skin disease in humans and other animals worldwide. Studies on molecular biology and fluorescent labeling of the fungus are limited. Here, we applied mCherry for the first time in T. mentagrophytes to label the fungus and its organelles. We constructed four expression vectors of mCherry or mCherry fusions containing a variety of resistance markers and promoters, which were then integrated, together with two previous mCherry expression vectors, in T. mentagrophytes via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (AtMT). The resulting transformants emitted bright red fluorescence. We used the histone protein H2B and the peroxisome targeting signal 1 (PTS1) peptide to target the nucleus and peroxisomes, respectively, in T. mentagrophytes. In the transformants expressing mCherry-fused H2B, the fluorescence was distinctly localized to the nuclei in hyphae, spores and the fungal cells in infected animal tissue. In the T. mentagrophytes transformants where the peroxisome was targeted, the mCherry was present as small dots (0.2-1 \u03bcm diameter) throughout the spores and the hyphae. We also constructed a T. mentagrophytes AtMT library containing more than 1000 hygromycin-resistant transformants that were genetically stable. Our results provide useful tools for further investigations on molecular pathogenesis of T. mentagrophytes.",

        "abstract": "In this study, the adjuvant effects of the extract of Cochinchina momordica seed ECMS+oil, oil alone, ECMS alone, conventional alum adjuvant on inactivated Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bb) vaccine or control using antigen alone without adjuvant were evaluated along with the underlying mechanism. The results in experiment A demonstrated that antibody levels in Bb whole cell protein in the ECMS800\u03bcg+oil group were significantly higher than in the other adjuvant groups (p<0.05) on day 21. The agglutination antibody titer was also higher than the other groups (p<0.05) on day 37. The ECMS800\u03bcg+oil group improved cellular immune responses compared to other adjuvant groups, including control using antigen alone without adjuvant and the PBS group (p<0.05). After Bb challenge, the ECMS800\u03bcg+oil group showed the highest protection rate, which was significantly higher than ECMS alone or control using antigen alone without adjuvant and the PBS group (p<0.05 and p<0.01). IgA cells in the ECMS800\u03bcg+oil group differed significantly from the IgA cells of other groups in the lungs (p<0.01). The results of cell recruitment showed that the number of lymphocytes in the ECMS400\u03bcg+oil were higher than the number of cells for other groups except the ECMS(100\u03bcg/800\u03bcg)+oil groups (p<0.05). Intermediate cells in the ECMS(100\u03bcg/400\u03bcg)+oil groups were higher than the number of cells for other groups, including the control using antigen alone group (p<0.05). Neutrophils in the ECMS(100\u03bcg/400\u03bcg/800\u03bcg)+oil groups were significantly higher than the ECMS 800\u03bcg and control using antigen alone groups (p<0.05). White blood cells in the ECMS100\u03bcg+oil group were significantly higher than the oil, ECMS800\u03bcg and control using antigen alone groups (p<0.05). IL-2 expression in the ECMS800\u03bcg+oil group was significantly higher than other groups, except for the ECMS400\u03bcg+oil group (p<0.05). IL-4 expression in the ECMS800\u03bcg+oil group was significantly higher than other groups (p<0.05). GATA3 in the ECMS800\u03bcg+oil groups was significantly higher than the oil, ECMS800\u03bcg and control using antigen alone group (p<0.05). ECMS-oil adjuvant mixture could most effectively protect B. bronchiseptica immunized rabbits and, therefore, could be an alternative way of improving B. bronchiseptica vaccination in rabbits. ",

        "abstract": "Background: T. mentagrophytes can infect all mammals, including rabbits, causing serious infections with remarkable economic losses for rabbit farmers. Berberine is an alkaloid that is effective against a variety of microbial infections such as T. mentagrophytes. Growth curve by dry weight determination and in-vivo antifungal assay were carried out to clarify the inhibitory effect of berberine hydrochloride against T. mentagrophytes. Transcriptomics analyses were also carried out for better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Results: The growth rate of T. mentagrophytes was significantly higher in control condition than under berberine hydrochloride or clotrimazole for 60 h. The growth rate of T. mentagrophytes was significantly slighter higher in berberine condition (1 mg) than under clotrimazole for 46 h. T. mentagrophytes seriously shrunk after berberine or clotrimazole treatment, as observed by TEM and in SEM. Significant recovery was evident in three berberine groups on day 6 compared with the DMSO group. Results from transcriptomics analyses showed 18,881 identified unigenes, including 18,754 and 12,127 in the NT and SwissProt databases. Among these, 12,011, 9174, and 11,679 unigenes belonged to 3 Gene Ontology (GO), 43 KEGG, and 25 KOG categories, respectively. Interestingly, we found that down-regulation of 14\u03b1-demethylase exposed to various medicines was slightly different, i.e., berberine hydrochloride (fold change \u22123.4956) and clotrimazole (fold change \u22122.1283) caused various degrees of alteration. Conclusions: Berberine hydrochloride could inhibit the growth of T. mentagrophytes. Berberine hydrochloride could also cure dermatosis induced by T. mentagrophytes. Down-regulation of 14\u03b1-demethylase exposed to various medicines was slightly different and might be one of the anti-resistance mechanisms of berberine hydrochloride in T. mentagrophytes. The present investigation provides considerable transcript sequence data that would help further assess the antifungal mechanisms against T. mentagrophytes, for antifungal medicine development.",

        "abstract": "The photodissociation dynamics of gas phase 2-nitrophenol at 266 and 355 nm were investigated by probing the nascent OH photoproducts using the laser-induced-fluorescence (LIF) technique. The OH fragments were generated from the aci-nitro isomer of 2-nitrophenol at 266 and 355 nm. Abstract Photodissociation of gaseous 2-nitrophenol at 266 and 355 nm was investigated by probing the nascent OH products with the laser-induced-fluorescence (LIF) technique. Rotational state distributions of the OH photofragments were measured and characterized by Boltzmann temperatures of 900 \u00b1 40 K and 1070 \u00b1 80 K at 266 and 355 nm, respectively. The OH photoproducts were found to be vibrationally cold at both photolysis wavelengths. Preferential populations of the OH F 1 (\u03a0 3/2 ) spin\u2013orbit state and \u03a0 + \u039b-doublet state were observed at both photolysis wavelengths. We have proposed a mechanism for OH production involving the photoisomerization to form aci-nitro isomers, which then dissociate into OH fragments. 1 Introduction Nitrophenols were first detected in rainwater by Nojima et al. [1] , and later their phytotoxic properties were found to be a contributory factor in forest decline [2,3] . In the troposphere, direct sources of nitrophenols created from the combustion of coal and wood, and the manufacture of phenolformaldehyde resins, explosives, dyes, and pharmaceuticals [4] . 2-Nitrophenol (2-NP) has attracted more attention in recent years because of its important role in atmospheric chemistry. The molecular geometry of 2-nitrophenol has been determined by the joint investigation of gas-phase electron diffraction and ab initio molecular orbital calculations [5] . Chen et al. have studied the photo- or thermal-induced reactions of 2-NP with DFT-B3LYP/6-31G \u2217 level of theory [6] . Recently, Wang et al. obtained Resonance Raman spectra of 2-NP in cyclohexane solution [7] . Nagaya et al. [8] used the matrix-isolation infrared spectroscopy of 2-NP to identify the conformation of the aci-nitro isomer of 2-NP, and examined the photoreaction mechanism with the aid of DFT and time-dependent DFT calculations. Formation of nitrous acid (HONO)/nitrite has been observed during the photolysis of nitrophenols in liquid [9\u201311] . Very recently, Bejan et al. [12] have studied the photolysis of gas-phase 2-NP in a flow tube photoreactor upon irradiation. Formation of HONO from this photochemical process was detected for the first time and the corresponding mechanism was discussed [12] . So far, there has been no report of OH radical formation in the photolysis of 2-NP, although OH was found in photodissociation of 2-nitrotoluene (2-NT) [13\u201320] . In this work, we focused on the detection of OH fragments produced from the photodissociation of gaseous 2-NP at 266 and 355 nm by the LIF technique. The photodissociation mechanism leading to OH fragments of 2-NP is discussed. 2 Experimental The experimental apparatus used in the present study has been described in detail elsewhere [21,22] . Briefly, the second-harmonic output (532 nm) of an Nd:YAG laser (Spectra-Physics, GCR-170) was used to pump a dye laser (Lumonics, HD-500, pulse length: 7\u20138 ns, 0.03 MW/cm 2 ), which generated the wavelength-tunable laser pulses. A DCM dye was used in the experiment. The output of the dye laser was then introduced into a Harmonic Generator (Lumonics, HT-1000) to produce the frequency-doubled probe laser pulses. The residual part of the 1064 nm output of the Nd:YAG laser was converted into 266 (FWHM: 4\u20135 ns, 3 MW/cm 2 ) and 355 nm (FWHM: 5\u20136 ns, 2.5 MW/cm 2 ), respectively, which provided the photolysis pulses. Both the photolysis and probe beams were softly focused on the center of the photolysis cell. The probe pulse was optically delayed with respect to the photolysis pulse by \u223c15 ns. This delay period was sufficient to separate the two laser pulses, and was short enough to make collision effects negligible under the pressure (typically 200 mTorr) used in the experiment. The density of 2-NP was calculated to be about 3.3 \u00d7 10 12 molecule/cm 3 in the photolysis cell. The fluorescence of the OH fragment was collected by a photomultiplier tube (PMT). A suitable band filter was placed in front of the PMT to cut off scattering from the photolysis-laser and probe-laser. The signal was gate-integrated by a Boxcar (SRS, SR250), A/D converted by a homemade interface, and stored into a personal computer. 2-Nitrophenol (\u2a7e99%) was purchased from Shenyang Lianbang Chemicals Reagents Company and used without further purification. Helium carrier gas was bubbled through the sample and the gas phase mixture was expanded into the photolysis cell. 3 Results and discussion The measured OH LIF intensity was found to be linearly dependent on the photolysis and probe laser powers, indicating that the photodissociation of 2-NP was a single-photon process. In our experiment, we chose the Q 1 (3.5) for monitoring the intensity of LIF signal. The corresponding relationship between the LIF signal intensity and both laser pulse energies is shown in Fig. 1 . In Fig. 1 a, the probe laser pulse energy was fixed at about 25 \u03bcJ/pulse at 266 and 355 nm, the photolysis laser pulsed energy varied from 0 to 3 mJ/pulse. From Fig. 1 a, below 2 mJ/pulse the intensity of the LIF signal was linearly dependent on the energy of photolysis laser. Above 2 mJ/pulse, the LIF signal saturated. In Fig. 1 b, the photolysis laser pulse energy was fixed at about 1.5 mJ/pulse, the probe laser pulsed energy varied from 0 to 100 \u03bcJ/pulse. As can be seen from Fig. 1 b, below 70 \u03bcJ/pulse, the intensity of LIF signal was linearly dependent on the energy of photolysis. Above 70 \u03bcJ/pulse, the LIF signal saturated. Fig. 2 a shows the experimental LIF excitation spectrum of the nascent OH A 2 \u03a3 + ( \u03c5 \u2032 = 0) \u2190 X 2 \u03a0 ( \u03c5 \u2033 = 0) from the photolysis at 266 nm. For assigning and analyzing the experimental LIF spectrum, the spectrum simulation of the OH A 2 \u03a3 + ( \u03c5\u2032 = 0) \u2190 X 2 \u03a0 ( \u03c5\u2033 = 0) transition was required. The intensities of the simulated fluorescence signal ( I F ) were related to the populations of a ground rovibrational state N ( J\u2033 , \u03c5\u2033 ) by the expression (1) I F \u221d N ( J \u2033 , \u03c5 \u2033 ) q \u03c5 \u2032 \u03c5 \u2033 S J \u2032 J \u2033 f ( \u03bd , \u03bd 0 ) ( 2 J \u2033 + 1 ) here q \u03c5 \u2032 \u03c5 \u2033 are the known Frank\u2013Condon factors for the OH A \u2013 X transition [23] ; S J\u2032J\u2033 are the line strengths for the OH A \u2013 X one-photon rotational transitions [24] ; and f ( \u03bd , \u03bd 0 ) = \u03c1 ( \u03bd 0 )exp(\u2212 a ( \u03bd \u2212 \u03bd 0 ) 2 ) is the laser intensity function. The OH transitions were labeled following Hund\u2019s case (a). The P, Q, or R branches were for cases in which \u0394 J = \u22121, 0, or 1, respectively, and the subscript 1 or 2 represents the 2 \u03a0 3/2 or 2 \u03a0 1/2 state, respectively. According to the parity selection rule (+ \u2194 \u2212), the Q branches only corresponded to the \u03a0 \u2212 state, while the P and R branches were attributed to the \u03a0 + state. Spin\u2013orbit and the \u039b-doublet ratios were calculated from the relative population of different states. The simulated spectra of the OH ( \u03c5 \u2032 = 0) \u2190 X 2 \u03a0 ( \u03c5 \u2033 = 0) band at 266 nm are plotted in Fig. 2 b. The OH rotational state population was determined by analyzing the Q, P, and R branches. In order to compare the measurements of each rotational level, the intensities of the observed LIF rotational lines were normalized with respect to the pressure in the photolysis cell, the energies of the probe-laser and the photolysis-laser. Based on the normalized experimental data, the rotational state distribution could be characterized by a Boltzmann temperature. The equation of the Boltzmann population distribution was expressed as (2) ln N ( J \u2033 ) ( 2 J \u2033 + 1 ) = - \u03b5 ( J \u2033 ) hc kT R + constant The best linear fit to the experimental data is shown in Fig. 3 . The rotational temperatures of the nascent OH at 266 and 355 nm were approximately 900 \u00b1 40 K and 1070 \u00b1 80 K, respectively. The probe laser was scanned in the range of OH A 2 \u03a3 + ( \u03c5 \u2032 = 1) \u2190 X 2 \u03a0 ( \u03c5 \u2033 = 1) transition, but the corresponding LIF signal was not observed from the photodissociation of 2-NP at both photolysis wavelengths. This indicates that there was no population distribution of the OH fragment in \u03c5 \u2033 = 1. The ratio of the \u03a0 3/2 state (probed by P 1 and Q 1 ) to that of the \u03a0 1/2 state (probed by P 2 and Q 2 ), generally known as the F 1 /F 2 ratio, is plotted versus rotational quantum number J \u2033 in Fig. 4 a. The OH photofragments exhibited a preferential population of the \u03a0 3/2 state with values of 1.6 \u00b1 0.2 and 1.4 \u00b1 0.3 at 266 and 355 nm, respectively. The preferential population of \u03a0 3/2 suggested a coupling between the initially excited states of 2-NP with a nearby triplet state of 2-NP [25] . The \u039b-doublet ratio represented the orientation of the p\u03c0 lobe with respect to the OH rotating plane, denoted as the \u03a0 \u2212 (A\u2033) and \u03a0 + (A\u2032) states. In the \u03a0 + (A\u2032) state, the p\u03c0 lobe laid in the plane of rotation while in the \u03a0 \u2212 (A\u2033) state the p\u03c0 lobe was perpendicular to it [25] . The \u039b-doublet ratios (\u03a0 \u2212 /\u03a0 + ) are plotted in Fig. 4 b, as a function of rotational quantum number J \u2033 . At both wavelengths, the distributions of the \u03a0 + states were more preferential to those of the \u03a0 \u2212 states. Similar state distributions and rotational energy in the OH product were found in the photodissociation of 2-NP at both 266 and 355 nm, although the available energy at 266 nm was 27 kcal/mol higher than that at 355 nm. The possible reason for the similar rotational distributions is that the dynamical constraint may exist in the 2-NP dissociation, due to the relatively strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding. In addition, the preference of the OH fragment in the \u03a0 + (A\u2032) state at both wavelengths indicated that the impulsive force acted along the dissociation bond. In the photodissociation of acetylacetone at 266 and 291 nm, Yoon et al. have proposed that the OH rotation is not expected to be highly excited even when the impulsive force along the dissociating C\u2013OH bond is considerable [26] . This may explain why the rotational distributions of the OH fragments were both found to be vibrationally cold at 266 and 355 nm. In the photodissociation of 2-NT, OH was produced and attributed to the so-called \u2018ortho effect\u2019 (H-transfer from the CH 3 \u2013 to the NO 2 \u2013 group) [13\u201315] . However, in the case of 2-NP, which contains an OH group, a feasible channel is the direct cleavage of the C\u2013OH bond of 2-NP to produce the OH fragment. To determine whether this channel is energetically permissible, the reaction energy of this OH production channel of 2-NP was calculated at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory with the G aussian 03 program package [27] . In this way, the reaction energy of this channel was calculated to be 113 kcal/mol, which was higher than the photon energy at 266 (107.5 kcal/mol) and 355 nm (80.5 kcal/mol). This indicates that the OH could not have been produced from direct cleavage of the C\u2013OH bond of 2-NP at the photolysis wavelengths 266 and 355 nm. Thus, the proposed \u2018ortho effect\u2019 may be applied to the photodissociation of 2-NP. 2-NP has a strong H bond between the H atom of the hydroxyl group and the O atom of the NO 2 group, which is stronger than that of the 2-NT [6] . Upon absorption of a photon at 266 and 355 nm, the 2-NP is excited to the S 4 and S 1 states, respectively [7] . The H transfer may take place in either the excited state or the ground state of 2-NP. After H transfer and rearrangement, four possible aci-nitro isomers of 2-NP would be formed. The 2-NP and four possible aci-nitro isomers of 2-NP are shown in Fig. 5 . Bejan et al. have observed the HONO product from 2-NP upon irradiation with 300\u2013500 nm in the gas phase, which supports the formation of aci-nitro isomers [12] . Furthermore, Nagaya et al. have studied the photoisomerization of 2-NP at 248 nm and found only one aci-nitro isomer of 2-NP (aci-nitro isomer 3 in Fig. 5 ) based on the observed FTIR bands of the product [8] . Both of them have assumed that the H transfer occurs on the excited energy surface. However, in the case of 2-NT, the experimental and theoretical studies have confirmed that the H transfer and the following OH production occurred on the ground state energy surface [18\u201320] . According to the present experimental results, we cannot determine the electronic state in which the H transfer and the following dissociation occurred. In addition, it is worth to mention that at atmospheric pressure, the collision frequency possibly leads to a deactivation of excited HONO molecules formed in the photolysis and HONO is thus detected. In fact, Bejan et al. have observed the HONO products from gaseous 2-NP upon irradiation at atmospheric pressure for the first time [12] . In the present experiment, a collision free 15 ns delay may be too long to exclude the pathway (3) 2 -NP + h \u03bd \u2192 R + HONO \u2217 (4) HONO \u2217 \u2192 OH + NO In order to clarify if the secondary photolysis to produce OH via reaction (4) existed or not in our experiment, the reaction energy of this OH production channel of 2-NP was calculated at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory with the G aussian 03 program package [27] . The reaction energies were calculated to be 79.3 kcal/mol and 42.9 kcal/mol for reaction (3) and (4) , respectively. Our calculated reaction energy for reaction (4) was close to that of Radhakrishnan et al. (48 kcal/mol) [28] . The reaction (4) only contributes to the production of OH when the nascent HONO produced via reaction (3) contains internal energy in excess of 42.9 kcal/mol. However, the photon energies of 266 and 355 nm were 107.5 and 80.5 kcal/mol, respectively. It is safe to assume that, under the present experimental conditions, the internal energy of HONO produced via reaction was less than 42.9 kcal/mol. Hence the secondary production of OH via reaction (4) was ruled out. Furthermore, the fact that intensity of LIF signal was linearly dependent on the intensities of both lasers also indicated that the nascent OH production was a primary product of 2-NP in the photodissociation of 266 and 355 nm. To obtain further insight into the mechanism leading to OH formation, more experiments and a high level of ab initio potential energy surfaces are necessary. Based on the above discussions, the mechanism for OH production is likely a multi-step reaction upon the photodissociation of 2-NP at 266 and 355 nm. The first step was H transfer after excitation at 266 and 355 nm and the second step was production of the OH fragment from the aci-nitro isomers of 2-NP. 4 Conclusion The photodissociation dynamics of 2-NP was investigated using the one-photon LIF technique at 266 and 355 nm. The observed nascent OH radical is vibrationally cold at both photolysis wavelengths and the rotational distributions could be characterized by Boltzmann temperatures of 900 \u00b1 40 K and 1070 \u00b1 80 K at 266 and 355 nm, respectively. Based on the energetic considerations and the mechanism for the OH formation of 2-NT, we have proposed that the OH fragments from photodissociation at 266 and 355 nm were produced through a multi-step reaction.

        "title": "Photodissociation dynamics of benzoic acid monomer at 266nm: The OH product channel",
        "abstract": "The important radical OH can be produced through multi channel photochemical processes from the photolysis of benzoic acid monomer at 266 nm. Abstract The photodissociation dynamics of benzoic acid monomer at 266 nm is investigated by probing the nascent OH photoproduct using the laser-induced-fluorescence (LIF) technique. The nascent OH radical is distributed in the ground vibrational state and the rotational temperature is 620 \u00b1 30 K. The F 1 ( 2 \u03a0 3/2 ) and F 2 ( 2 \u03a0 1/2 ) spin-orbit states of OH photofragment are unstatistically populated, and \u039b-doublet levels are not equally populated. The present study associated with the available dynamics information predicts that OH radical is mainly produced from benzoic acid monomer on the T 2 energy surface. 1 Introduction The photodissociation of carboxylic acids has been investigated extensively [1\u201314] because it generates the important OH radical in atmosphere. Guest and co-workers [6,7] have investigated the photodissociation dynamics of acetic acid excited at 218 and 200 nm and shown that the acetic acid undergoes solely two-body dissociation to produce OH. Recently, Kumar and co-workers have studied the photodissociation dynamics of saturated [8\u201311] and unsaturated [12\u201314] carboxylic acids. They observed an appreciable amount of energy being channeled into the relative translation of OH and its cofragment. Most of these acids undergo dissociation to produce OH from excited state with an exit barrier [8,10\u201312,14] . Benzoic acid monomer is the simplest aromatic carboxylic acid. As such, this molecule possesses a number of properties that make a detailed examination of its photochemistry and photophysics process worthwhile. The monomer of benzoic acid was found to show phosphorescence alone with a high quantum yield because the intersystem crossing to the lowest triplet occurs very efficiently in the benzoic acid monomer [15] . Kamei et al. [16] have used the sensitized phosphorescence excitation spectroscopy to study the electronic excited states of the benzoic acid monomer in supersonic jets. The technique of laser desorption followed by jet cooling has been used to identify the S 1 \u2190 S 0 absorption spectra of the benzoic acid monomer in the gas phase [17] . Ion dip spectroscopy and density functional calculation were applied to determine the frequencies and intensities of the IR active modes for the monomer [18] . In addition, a few experimental and theoretical investigations [19,20] have been performed to probe the decarboxylation mechanisms of benzoic acid and its complexes with water. In a recent work, Fang and co-workers [21] have studied the geometric and electronic structures of various excited states of benzoic acid monomer using CASSCF and DFT methods. Furthermore, they have investigated the dissociation dynamics of three reaction channels: (1) C 6 H 5 COOH \u2192 C 6 H 6 + CO 2 (2) \u2192 C 6 H 5 CO + OH (3) \u2192 C 6 H 5 + COOH Comparing with the study of other carboxylic acids [1\u201314] , there is a general lack of the channel (2) information on benzoic acid monomer photodissociation, especially from the experimental viewpoint. In this Letter, we report the investigation of benzoic acid monomer at 266 nm photolysis with focus on the detection of OH fragment, and discuss the photodissociation mechanism leading to OH in this photochemical process. 2 Experimental The experimental apparatus used in the present study has been described in detail elsewhere [22\u201324] . Briefly, the second-harmonic output (532 nm) of an Nd: YAG laser (Spectra-Physics, GCR-170) was used to pump a dye laser (Lumonics, HD-500), which generated the wavelength-tunable laser pulses. The DCM dye was used in the experiment. The output of the dye laser was then introduced into a Harmonic Generator (Lumonics, HT-1000) to produce the frequency-doubled laser pulses, which were used for the probe laser pulses. The residual part of the 1064 nm output of the Nd: YAG laser was converted into 266 nm (3 \u223c 4 ns duration) by two KD \u2217 P crystals, which provided the photolysis pulses. Both the photolysis and probe beams were counter propagated and softly focused on the center of the photolysis cell. The probe pulse was optically delayed with respect to the photolysis pulse by \u223c15 ns. This delay period was sufficient to separate the two laser pulses, and was short enough to make collision effects negligible under the pressure (typically 200 mTorr) used in the experiment. The OH fragment was probed by exciting the A 2 \u03a3 + ( \u03c5 \u2032 = 0) \u2190 X 2 \u03a0 ( \u03c5 \u2033 = 0) transition of OH and by monitoring the subsequent A \u2192 X emission. The fluorescence of OH fragment was collected by a photomultiplier tube (PMT). A suitable narrow-band filter (310 nm) was placed in front of the PMT to cut off scattering from the photolysis-laser and probe-laser. The signal was gate-integrated by a Boxcar (SRS, SR250), A/D converted by a homemade interface, and stored into a personal computer. Benzoic acid (\u2a7e99.5%) was purchased from Shenyang Lianbang Chemicals Reagents Company and used without further purification. During the experiment the sample was heated to 370 K and helium carrier gas was bubbled through the sample and the gas mixture was expanded into the photolysis cell. 3 Results and discussion Generally, benzoic acid exists in the form of dimer at low temperatures [25] , which is well documented by Baum and McClure [26] . When benzoic acid is seeded in a beam by using a heated nozzle and bubbling with the carrier gas, a large concentration of monomer beam can be produced. In this experiment, we have heated the sample and nozzle to 370 K for producing a beam with high concentration benzoic acid monomer. For distinguishing the monomer from dimer of benzoic acid, we have measured the fluorescence excitation spectrum from 279 to 281 nm of the gas mixture used in our experimental condition. The spectrum is shown in Fig. 1 . We do not find the fluorescence peak at 279.9 nm (arrow position) which was assigned as the electronic transition origin of the benzoic acid dimer [27] . The result indicated clearly there was no benzoic acid dimer in our experimental condition. The observed LIF excitation spectra in Fig. 1 was carefully analyzed and attributed to rotational spectra of the OH A 2 \u03a3 + ( \u03c5 \u2032 = 1) \u2190 X 2 \u03a0 ( \u03c5 \u2033 = 0) R 21 branch (Hund\u2019s case (a)), the detailed assignment is listed on the top of the spectra. The OH fragment was produced from the photodissociation of benzoic acid monomer. 3.1 The state distribution of OH photofragment The measured OH LIF signal was found to be linearly dependent on the photolysis as well as probe laser powers, indicating that the photodissociation of benzoic acid monomer is a single-photon process. Fig. 2 a shows the experimental LIF excitation spectrum of the nascent OH A 2 \u03a3 + ( \u03c5 \u2032 = 0) \u2190 X 2 \u03a0 ( \u03c5 \u2033 = 0) from Benzoic acid monomer photolysis at 266 nm. For assigning and analyzing the experimental LIF spectra, the spectrum simulation of OH A 2 \u03a3 + ( \u03c5 \u2032 = 0) \u2190 X 2 \u03a0 ( \u03c5 \u2033 = 0) is needed. The intensities of the simulated fluorescence signal ( I F ) are related to the populations of a ground rovibrational state N ( J \u2033, \u03c5 \u2033) by the expression: I F \u221d N ( J \u2033 , \u03c5 \u2033 ) q \u03c5 \u2032 \u03c5 \u2033 S J \u2032 J \u2033 f ( \u03bd , \u03bd 0 ) ( 2 J \u2033 + 1 ) Where q \u03c5 \u2032 \u03c5 \u2033 are the known Frank\u2013Condon factors for the OH A - X transition [28] ; S J \u2032 J \u2033 are the line strengths for the OH A - X one-photon rotational transitions [29] ; and f ( \u03bd , \u03bd 0 ) = \u03c1 ( \u03bd 0 ) exp (\u2212 a ( \u03bd \u2212 \u03bd 0 ) 2 ) is the laser intensity function. The OH transitions were labeled following Hund\u2019s case (a). The P, Q, or R branches are for the cases of \u0394 J = \u22121, 0, or 1, respectively, while the subscript 1 and 2 represents 2 \u03a0 3/2 and 2 \u03a0 1/2 states. According to the parity selection rule (+ \u2194 \u2212), the Q branches only correspond to the \u03a0 \u2212 state, while the P and R branches are attributed to the \u03a0 + state. Spin-orbit and the \u039b-doublet ratios are calculated from the relative population of different states. The simulated spectrum of OH ( \u03c5 \u2032 = 0) \u2190 X 2 \u03a0 ( \u03c5 \u2033 = 0) band is plotted in Fig. 2 b. The OH rotational state population at 266 nm photolysis of benzoic acid monomer is determined by analyzing the P and R branches, which are free from the nearby satellite lines. In order to compare the measurement of each rotational level, the intensities of the observed LIF rotational lines were normalized with respect to the pressure in the photolysis cell, the energies of the probe-laser and the photolysis-laser. Based on the normalized experimental data, the rotational state distribution could be characterized by a Boltzmann temperature. The equation of the Boltzmann population distribution is expressed as ln N ( J \u2033 ) ( 2 J \u2033 + 1 ) = - \u03b5 ( J \u2033 ) hc kT R + constant The best linear fit to the experimental data is shown in Fig. 3 . The rotational temperature of the nascent OH is about 620 \u00b1 30 K, corresponding to a total rotational energy in the OH product of 1.1 \u00b1 0.1 kcal/mol. The probe laser was scanned in the range of OH A 2 \u03a3 + ( \u03c5 \u2032 = 1) \u2190 X 2 \u03a0 ( \u03c5 \u2033 = 1) transition, but no OH A 2 \u03a3 + ( \u03c5 \u2032 = 1) \u2190 X 2 \u03a0 ( \u03c5 \u2033 = 1) LIF signal was observed from the photodissociation of benzoic acid monomer. This indicates that there is no population distribution of OH fragment in \u03c5 \u2033 = 1. The ratio of \u03a0 3/2 state (probed by P 1 and Q 1 ) to that of \u03a0 1/2 state (probed by P 2 and Q 2 ), generally known as F 1 /F 2 ratio, is plotted versus rotational quantum number J in Fig. 4 . The OH photofragment exhibits a preferential population of \u03a0 3/2 state with the value of 1.5 \u00b1 0.2. The preferential population of \u03a0 3/2 suggests a coupling between the initially excited state with a nearby triplet state [30] . The \u039b-doublet ratio represents the orientation of the p\u03c0 lobe with respect to the OH rotating plane, denoted as \u03a0 \u2212 ( A \u2033) and \u03a0 + ( A \u2032) state. In the \u03a0 + ( A \u2032) state, the p\u03c0 lobe lies in the plane of rotation while in the \u03a0 \u2212 ( A \u2033) state the p\u03c0 lobe is perpendicular to it [30] . The \u039b-doublet ratio ( \u03a0 \u2212 / \u03a0 + ) is plotted in Fig. 5 , as function of rotational quantum number J , determined by intensities of Q and P lines of OH fragment. The average \u039b-doublet ratio is 1.2 \u00b1 0.1. The distribution of the \u03a0 \u2212 state is slightly preferential than that of the \u03a0 + state, which suggests that the p\u03c0 electronic orbital of the OH radical is preferentially perpendicular to its plane of rotation. 3.2 Dynamical interpretation of OH product channel The geometric and electronic structures of various excited states of benzoic acid monomer have been studied in detail [21] . The calculated adiabatic excitation energy of benzoic acid monomer from S 0 to S 2 is about 100.7 kcal/mol [21] which is in good agreement with the experimental result (102.7 kcal/mol) [17] . Considering our experimental condition, benzoic acid is excited to S 2 state by a 266 nm photon. There is a deep potential well in the S 2 potential energy surface and the direct dissociation can not proceed from the S 2 state of benzoic acid monomer [21] . Benzoic acid molecule in the S 2 state would decay through different paths. Based on the phosphorescence but nonfluorescence property of benzoic acid monomer, Kamei et al. [16] have proposed two efficient nonradiative processes. One is internal conversion from S 2 to S 1 state and then intersystem crossing from S 1 to T 1 state; another is intersystem crossing from S 2 to T 2 state. The T 1 state is localized in the aromatic ring and correlates with channel (3) of benzoic acid dissociation [21] , so we firstly ruled out the T 1 state as the dissociating state for producing OH fragment. The phosphorescence processes from T 1 to S 0 and T 2 to S 0 of benzoic acid monomer indicate OH is possibly produced from the S 0 state of the benzoic acid monomer, but we did not find OH signal when the excited energy (305 nm\u2013315 nm) is below the T 2 barrier, these results indicate the OH can not be produced from the S 0 state in our experimental condition. When benzoic acid monomer is excited by 266 nm laser photon, it has sufficient energy to pass the barriers of S 1 and T 2 . The following three paths were proposed to explain the OH produced from benzoic acid monomer, C 6 H 5 COOH (S 0 ) \u2192 (S 2 ) \u2192 (S 1 ) \u2192 OH; C 6 H 5 COOH (S 0 ) \u2192 (S 2 ) \u2192 (S 1 ) \u2192 (S 1 /T 1 /T 2 ) \u2192 (T 2 ) \u2192 OH; C 6 H 5 COOH (S 0 ) \u2192 (S 2 ) \u2192 (T 2 ) \u2192 OH. Considering the theoretical calculation [21] , the barrier of T 2 is lower than that of S 1 , and there is a three-surface intersection S 1 /T 1 /T 2 , the T 2 state is dominant to produce OH fragment from the photodissociation of benzoic acid monomer at 266 nm. The C O bond cleavage is theoretically predicted to be endothermic by 98.7 kcal/mol [21] . The internal energy of benzoic acid molecular (at 370 K) was obtained by ab initio calculations using the G aussian program package [31] . The B3LYP calculations were performed using the 6-311+G (d, p) basis set. The calculated available energy is 15.3 kcal/mol but only 1.1 kcal/mol of the available energy distributed into OH internal energy in our experiment. The energy distribution of OH fragment from the benzoic acid monomer photodissociation is very similar to that of other carboxylic acids [8,10\u201312] . The low internal energy of OH fragment is due to the presence of a barrier or a repulsive potential energy surface in the exit channel, which implies that the C OH bond scission takes place on an electronically excited potential energy surface T 2 . The relative population of the \u039b-doublet of OH fragment provides the exit channel dynamics in the bond cleavage process. In the case of benzoic acid, the \u03a0 \u2212 / \u03a0 + ratio is 1.2 \u00b1 0.1. The \u039b-doublet ratio suggests that the transition state for OH-forming reaction is slightly non-planar in nature [30] . The calculated geometry of the transition state on T 2 surface is a non-planar structure [21] . Hence, the \u039b-doublet ratio also support that OH was produced from the T 2 states of benzoic acid monomer. 4 Conclusion The photodissociation dynamics of Benzoic acid monomer has been investigated at 266 nm. The nascent OH state distributions are measured using LIF technique. It is seen that the OH photofragment is vibrationally cold with the rotational temperature of 620 \u00b1 30 K from benzoic acid monomer photolysis. The 2 \u03a0 3/2 state is preferential populated than the 2 \u03a0 1/2 state of the OH fragment. The \u039b-doublet ratio indicates a nonplanar transition state geometry for the OH channel. Finally, it is concluded that T 2 channel is dominant to produce OH fragment from the benzoic acid monomer photodissociation at 266 nm.

        "abstract": "The 266 nm photodissociation of CH 3 ONO has been studied using the single-photon LIF technique. A fraction of CH 3 O (X 2 E) from the photodissociation can possess enough internal energy to isomerize into CH 2 OH which then decays to OH + CH 2 . The rotational state distributions, spin\u2013orbit and \u039b-doublets states populations of OH radicals are determined. Abstract The 266 nm photodissociation of gaseous CH 3 ONO has been studied by monitoring the OH (X 2 \u03a0) product using the single-photon LIF technique. The OH fragment has been found to be vibrationally cold and its rotational state distribution conformed to a Boltzmann distribution. The ratios of 2 \u03a0 3/2 to 2 \u03a0 1/2 of the OH fragment were found to be close to unity. The population in the \u03a0 \u2212 state for the \u039b-doublets was dominant. An additional decay channel, yielding OH(X 2 \u03a0) fragments, has been observed and assigned to CH 3 ONO + h\u03bd \u2192 NO(X 2 \u03a0) + CH 3 O(X 2 E), CH 3 O(X 2 E) \u2192 CH 2 OH( 2 A) \u2192 CH 2 ( 3 B 1 ) + OH(X 2 \u03a0). 1 Introduction The investigation of photodissociation of polyatomic molecules is a beneficial step towards the understanding of the microscopic dynamics of chemical reactions. Methyl nitrite (CH 3 ONO) is one of the very few prototypes of medium-sized polyatomic molecules. Its near-UV absorption spectra consist of two different band systems [1] : one is a structured band in the range of 300\u2013380 nm (S 1 , n \u2192 \u03c0 \u2217 ) and the other is a broad and unstructured band centering near 210 nm (S 2 , \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2217 ). The photodissociation of methyl nitrite has been widely studied both experimentally [1\u201315] and theoretically [16\u201322] over the last 20 years, and most studies were focusing on the first absorption band. In contrast to the detailed studies of the S 1 state of methyl nitrite, very few reports have been concerned with the second absorption band (S 2 state). Huber and his group [1,11] have measured the translational energy distributions at 248 and 193 nm with a molecular beam time-of-flight apparatus. Farmamara et al. [12] have determined the lifetime of the S 2 state of the methyl nitrite molecule within (25 \u00b1 15) fs using the pump-probe technique with 125 fs laser pulses at wavelengths near 200 nm. Winniczek et al. [13] studied the photodissociation of methyl nitrite in the range of 223\u2013227 nm of the S 2 state by resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) photoelectron spectroscopy. In our previous paper, we have reported the internal energy state distributions and the rotational alignments of the NO fragments from the photodissociation of the S 2 state of CH 3 ONO by employing the polarized single-photon laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) technique [14] . At the present work, we have investigated the photodissociation of the S 2 state at 266 nm of the methyl nitrite using the single-photon LIF. The primary reaction of methyl nitrite in the photodissociation is (1) CH 3 ONO + h\u03bd \u2192 NO(X 2 \u03a0) + CH 3 O(X 2 E) As for the methoxy radicals, we have observed that a fraction of them can possess sufficient internal energy to isomerize into CH 2 OH ( 2 A), which then decays into OH (X 2 \u03a0) + CH 2 ( 3 B 1 ). 2 Experimental The methyl nitrite photodissociation experiments were carried out under bulk conditions at 266 nm and the OH fragments were probed by the single-photon LIF technique. The schematic of the laser photolysis-laser-induced fluorescence setup used in the present study has been described in detail elsewhere [14] . Briefly, one portion of the 1064 nm output of the Nd:YAG laser (Spectra-Physics, GCR-170, 10 Hz) was converted by a KD \u2217 P crystal to the 266 nm and provided the photolysis pulses. The other portion of the YAG output was frequency-doubled to 532 nm and used to pump a tunable dye laser (Lumonics, HD-500). The output of the dye laser was frequency-doubled again through a Harmonic Generator (Lumonics, HT-1000) and used for the probe pulses. The photolysis beam and the probe beam were counterpropagated and softly focused on the center of the photolysis cell. The probe pulse was optically delayed with respect to the photolysis pulse by \u223c15 ns. This delay period was sufficient to separate the two laser pulses, and was short enough to make collision effects negligible under the pressure (typically 200 mTorr) used in the experiments. The fluorescence was collected by a 50 mm diameter lens with a focal length of 100 mm, and was detected through a photomultiplier tube (PMT) (EMI, 6256B). A suitable band pass filter was placed between the collecting lens and the PMT to cut off scattering from the photolysis-laser and the probe-laser. The fluorescence signal was gate-integrated by a Boxcar (SRS, SR250), A/D converted by a homemade interface, and stored in a personal computer using a data-taking program. The LIF signal was linear with respect to the pressure of the sample, the photolysis-laser intensity, and the probe-laser intensity. The intensity of the probe-laser was reduced to about 0.1 mJ/pulse, so that the OH transition would not be saturated. The LIF spectra were recorded at least three times to ensure a proper signal was obtained. Methyl nitrite was prepared by dropwise adding dilute sulphuric acid to a solution of sodium nitrite in aqueous methanol. The gaseous ester was condensed in a cold trap at 77 K and then purified by trap-to-trap distillation in vacuum. The pure methyl nitrite (10%) with He was introduced slowly into the photolysis cell. 3 Results and discussion Cui and Morokuma [23] have studied the photodissociation mechanisms of the methoxy radical (CH 3 O) by means of the ab initio MO theory. One channel they have considered was that CH 3 O isomerized to CH 2 OH, followed by dissociation to CH 2 + OH. For the excited state (A 2 A 1 ) of the CH 3 O, Osborn et al. [24] have observed the dissociation channel described above. In the ground state (X 2 E) of CH 3 O, to the best of our knowledge, the dissociation channel of CH 3 O has not been observed in any experiments. Based on the energy calculated by Cui and Morokuma, it would need 3.89 eV for the decomposition from the ground state (X 2 E) of CH 3 O to CH 2 ( 3 B 1 ) + OH(X 2 \u03a0) without a barrier. However, it would need at least 5.06 eV in the case of transformation from the excited state (A 2 A 1 ) of CH 3 O to CH 2 ( 1 A 1 ) + OH(X 2 \u03a0). In our experiments, the energy of a 266 nm photon (\u223c4.66 eV) was higher than 3.89 eV but less than 5.06 eV. As a result of energy consideration, we ascribe the origin of the OH to the following processes: (2) CH 3 ONO + h \u03bd \u2192 NO ( X 2 \u03a0 ) + CH 3 O ( X 2 E ) (3) CH 3 O ( X 2 E ) \u2192 CH 2 OH ( 2 A ) \u2192 CH 2 ( 3 B 1 ) + OH ( X 2 \u03a0 ) The LIF spectra of the OH fragments from CH 3 ONO photolysis at 266 nm were recorded by scanning the OH X 2 \u03a0 ( \u03c5 \u2033 = 0) \u2192 A 2 \u03a3 + ( \u03c5 \u2032 = 0) transitions in the 306\u2013315 nm range. In order to precisely assign the J \u2033 levels of the OH populated in the dissociation process, it is necessary to compare the experimental spectra with the simulated ones calculated from the known spectroscopic constants [25] . The intensities of the fluorescence signal ( I F ) are related to the populations of a ground rovibrational state N ( J \u2033, \u03c5 \u2033) by the expression (4) I F \u221d N ( J \u2033 , \u03c5 \u2033 ) q \u03c5 \u2032 \u03c5 \u2033 S J \u2032 J \u2033 f ( \u03bd , \u03bd 0 ) ( 2 J \u2033 + 1 ) where q \u03c5 \u2032 \u03c5 \u2033 are the known Franck\u2013Condon factors for the OH A\u2013X transition [25] ; S J \u2032 J \u2033 are the line strengths for the OH A\u2013X one-photon rotational transitions [26] ; and f ( \u03bd , \u03bd 0 ) = \u03c1 ( \u03bd 0 )exp(\u2212 a ( \u03bd \u2212 \u03bd 0 ) 2 ) is the laser intensity function. A portion of the typical LIF spectra of the OH fragment is shown in Fig. 1 , together with the corresponding simulated one. The rotational lines were monitored up to N = 15 and peaked at N = 7. The OH transitions were labeled following Hund\u2019s case (a). The P, Q, or R branches are for the cases of \u0394 J = \u22121, 0, or 1, respectively. According to the parity selection rule (+ \u2194 \u2212), the Q branches only correspond to the \u03a0 \u2212 state, while the P and R branches are attributed to the \u03a0 + state. Detailed analysis of the quantum state distributions of the OH fragment is presented as follows. The rotational state populations of nascent OH radicals were determined by analyzing the P, Q, and R branches from the 2 \u03a0 3/2 state. In order to compare the measurement of each rotational level, intensities of the observed LIF rotational lines were normalized with respect to the pressure of the sample in the photolysis cell, the probe-laser and the photolysis-laser energies. Based on the normalized experimental data, we found that the rotational state distribution could be characterized by a Boltzmann temperature. The equation of the Boltzmann population distribution is expressed as (5) ln N ( J \u2033 ) ( 2 J \u2033 + 1 ) = - \u03b5 ( J \u2033 ) hc kT R + constant The best linear fit to the experimental data is given in Fig. 2 . The rotational temperature was calculated from the line slope, T R = 2200 \u00b1 150 K. The OH fragment was found to be vibrationally cold and no LIF signals of the OH(X 2 \u03a0, \u03bd \u2033 = 1) were detected in our experiments. The rotational energy E \u03bd \u2033 rot of the ground state X 2 \u03a0 ( \u03bd \u2033 = 0) was calculated by E v \u2033 rot = \u2211 J \u2033 N ( J \u2033 ) \u03b5 ( J \u2033 ) and was 3.49 \u00b1 0.2 kcal/mol. Because of spin\u2013orbit coupling, the ground state (X 2 \u03a0) of the OH radical splits into two different states: 2 \u03a0 3/2 and 2 \u03a0 1/2 . The ratios of the populations of the 2 \u03a0 3/2 and 2 \u03a0 1/2 states were plotted against the rotational quantum number J ( Fig. 3 ). As can be seen from the plot, the ratios are close to unity for all values of J . Thus, we can conclude that the distribution of the OH population between the two spin\u2013orbit states is statistical, and there is no preferential population for either of these two states. The \u039b-doublets arise from the orientation of p\u03c0 lobes of OH with respect to the plane of rotation. In the \u03a0 + (A\u2032) state, the p\u03c0 lobe lies in the plane of rotation, while in the \u03a0 \u2212 (A\u2033) state the p\u03c0 lobe is perpendicular to the plane of rotation. As mentioned earlier, the Q branches are for the detecting of the OH fragment in the \u03a0 \u2212 state, while the R (and P) branches are due to the \u03a0 + state [27] . The R/Q (or P/Q) intensity ratios represent the ratios of the \u039b-doublets, which give information about the relative population of the OH fragment in the \u03a0 + and \u03a0 \u2212 states [27\u201329] . The ratios of P/Q versus the rotational quantum number J in the \u03a0 3/2 and \u03a0 1/2 states are depicted in Fig. 4 . The distribution of the \u03a0 \u2212 state is rather preferential than that of the \u03a0 + state in both \u03a0 3/2 and \u03a0 1/2 states, which suggests that the p\u03c0 electronic orbital of the OH radical is predominantly perpendicular to its plane of rotation. 4 Conclusion The OH(X 2 \u03a0) fragment has been observed from the photodissociation of CH 3 ONO in our experiments. Combining the analysis of our experimental conditions and the calculations of Cui and Morokuma [23] , we conclude that the OH fragment origins from a fraction of CH 3 O(X 2 E) photofragments, which possesses enough internal energy to isomerize into CH 2 OH ( 2 A) and then decays into OH (X 2 \u03a0) + CH 2 ( 3 B 1 ). We have measured the state distribution of the nascent OH fragment using the LIF technique. The OH fragment is vibrationally cold and its rotational state distribution shows a Boltzmann behavior at T rot = 2200 \u00b1 150 K and peaks at N = 7. Experimental data analysis demonstrates that the 2 \u03a0 3/2 to 2 \u03a0 1/2 ratios of the populations of the OH fragments are close to unity and the population in the \u03a0-state is preferential for two \u039b-doublet states.

A study of the biological characteristics of C. fairylakea populations showed that this species had a narrow colonization area within 300 hm2, and an island pattern of distribution. Because of the overexploitation, urbanization, environment pollution, plant diseases, and insect pests, the wild populations and individuals of C. fairylakea decreased markedly in the past decades. All five populations have an opposite pyramid age structure, few coning plants, few seed production, and low level of seed germination rate or sterility. In conclusion, C. fairylakea in Guangdong Province was threatened seriously and an urgent need to take effective efforts to protect the plants and habitats in its location sites was required. \u00a9 2006 Higher Education Press.",

        "abstract": "Cycas fairylakea is an endangered endemic species in China. Genetic diversity within and among four natural populations of this species in China was investigated using amplified fragments length polymorphism (AFLP). A moderate to low level of intraspecific genetic diversity was detected in this species (at population level: P = 39.57 %, H 0 = 0.244; at species level: P = 60.22%, H 0 = 0.356). The among-population component accounted for, respectively, 25.7 and 31.5% of the genetic variation, according to AMOVA and Shannon's index, indicating most of the genetic variation was found between individuals within populations. All four populations have opposite pyramid age structure, and few coning individuals, which is still decreasing. Possibly because of habitat degradation and environmental pollution, plant diseases and insect pests in the populations were extremely serious, suggesting that the main factors threatening the survival of C. fairylakea populations were not genetic variation, but human activities and the breeding system of this species. \u00a9 Springer 2006.",

        "abstract": "Sorafenib is the standard therapeutic strategy for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following hepatectomy. However, only few patients truly benefit from this therapy. Thus, new strategies combined with sorafenib are urgently required. We herein present the case of a patient with hepatic and extrahepatic HCC recurrence following hepatectomy, who was treated by combined sorafenib, focused ultrasound knife and DRibbles-pulsed dendritic cell (DC) vaccine. Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot assay (ELISPOT) and intracellular staining (ICS) analysis were used to detect the secretion of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 by T cells at different timepoints of the vaccine in order to evaluate the patient's specific T-cell response to SMMC-7721-derived DRibbles vaccine. The \u03b1-fetoprotein level decreased from 103,295 to 5 ng/ml and the patient displayed improved liver function, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0, remission of liver metastases and disappearance of the lung metastases 8 months post-combination therapy. The computed tomography scan revealed the disappearance of liver metastases 2 years post-combination therapy. The ELISPOT data revealed a low antigen-specific T-cell response 4 weeks after the first vaccine cycle and the response decreased to nearly zero prior to the second cycle. However, high antigen-specific T-cell response was observed 2 weeks after the second vaccine cycle and did not decrease, even after 10 months, which was consistent with the result of the ICS analysis, which demonstrated that most of the secreted IFN-\u03b3 was produced by CD4 T cells, whereas a low CD8 T-cell response was observed (0.429 vs. 0.0665%, respectively). Our results demonstrated that antigen-specific T-cell response aimed to treat recurrent HCC may be induced through stimulation by the DC-DRibbles vaccine. The success of the treatment supports the combination of sorafenib, focused ultrasound knife and DC-DRibbles vaccine as a therapeutic strategy for patients with HCC recurrence following hepatectomy.",

        "abstract": "The present retrospective study aimed to investigate the mid-term safety and efficacy of hepatectomy combined with microwave ablation of the partial spleen for treatment of liver cancer complicated with hypersplenism. A retrospective analysis was performed on 23 patients who underwent hepatectomy combined with microwave ablation of the partial spleen for liver cancer, complicated with hypersplenism that was secondary to cirrhosis. The splenic and ablated volumes were calculated according to a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan prior to and 2 weeks after the operation. Complete blood count and liver function tests were examined prior to and following the surgery, and complications and changes in the blood tests were monitored for 6 months. Over this period of investigation, the splenic volume was reduced by a mean value of 34.0%. The levels of serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were increased on the first day after the operation (P<0.05), although they recovered to the normal level within 1 week (P<0.05). The total level of bilirubin increased slightly, along with moderately decreased levels of albumin and cholinesterase on the first day, although these changes were not significant compared with the baseline (P>0.05). The white blood cell count was persistently significantly higher compared with the baseline over the course of the 6 months (P>0.05). The platelet count did not increase significantly for the first week after the operation (P>0.05); however, it was revealed to be significantly increased 1 month after the surgery (P<0.05). No significant complications were occurred during the follow-up period. In conclusion, hepatectomy combined with microwave ablation of the spleen was demonstrated to be a safe and effective procedure for patients with liver cancer and hypersplenism in the mid-term.",

While Mg content was achieved or less approximately 0.29 ( x , atomic ratio) in ZnO lattice, the crystal lattice of the synthesized samples exhibited wurtzite structure. The Mg atoms were distributed into the ZnO crystal as the interstitial and displaced atoms, and there was no phase separation in preparing Zn 1\u2013 x Mg x O nanowire arrays. However, as the Mg content was up to 0.53 ( x ) in the fabricated Zn 1\u2013 x Mg x O samples, a clear phase separation phenomena appeared in the Zn 1\u2013 x Mg x O crystal. Compared with the PL spectrum of the pure ZnO nanowire arrays, the analytic results showed that a blue-shift of the near-band edge emission with increasing Mg content was observed in the Zn 1\u2013 x Mg x O arrays. And the relative intensities of green peak at ca 535 nm and UV emission peak at ca 376 nm were all restrained.",

        "abstract": "The ZnO nanowire-based insulation gate field effect transistors were fabricated by connecting single ZnO nano wires across three kinds of symmetrical metal trenches (Au, Zn and Al thin films) with different widths. In the testing processes, the traditional ion beam eroding technology, electronic probe, and atom force microscopy probe methods were employed. The I-V characteristics of various synthesized ZnO nanowire-based devices were researched. The results showed that the main effecting factor on the I-V characteristic is the type of contact between the ZnO nanowire and the surface of different trenches, which may be of the Ohmic or the Schottky contact type in different cases. Finally, the I-V characteristics of the fabricated devices had been discussed by using the electron transport mechanism.",

The microstructures and optical properties of the synthesized Zn1-xMgxO nanowire arrays were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive analysis X-ray (EDAX), and photoluminescence (PL) spectrum analytic apparatus, respectively. While Mg content was achieved or less approximately 0.29 (x, atomic ratio) in ZnO lattice, the crystal lattice of the synthesized samples exhibited wurtzite structure. The Mg atoms were distributed into the ZnO crystal as the interstitial and displaced atoms, and there was no phase separation in preparing Zn1-xMgxO nanowire arrays. However, as the Mg content was up to 0.53 (x) in the fabricated Zn1-xMgxO samples, a clear phase separation phenomena appeared in the Zn1-xMgxO crystal. Compared with the PL spectrum of the pure ZnO nanowire arrays, the analytic results showed that a blue-shift of the near-band edge emission with increasing Mg content was observed in the Zn1-xMgxO arrays. And the relative intensities of green peak at ca 535 nm and UV emission peak at ca 376 nm were all restrained.",

The pregnancy courses and clinical outcomes were analyzed.While 12 patients in planned pregnancy group showed active SLE during pregnancy, all 32 patients in the unplanned pregnancy group presented severe SLE complications. The incidences of pregnancy loss, preterm delivery and neonatal asphyxia in the unplanned pregnancy group were significantly higher than planned pregnancy group (P < 0.05), and the infant body weight was lower in the unplanned pregnancy group (P < 0.05). A total of 78 live infants were born and no mortality was reported, including 15 preterm infants and one neonatal SLE.Planned pregnancy during stable stage, appropriate treatment in pregnancy and close monitoring can improve the security of pregnancy complicating SLE. In situations that the drug treatment is ineffective and the mother and infant are threatened, or the fetus is mature, the pregnancy should be terminated promptly, thereby reducing the complications, and increasing the success rate of pregnancy and perinatal survival rate.",

Patients with uterine packing in the control of massive hemorrhage during cesarean section were identified. The indications, uterine packing procedures, estimated blood loss, postoperative complications, and packing material used were reviewed.A total of 70 patients were identified among 1,121 women with placenta previa during the study period. Sixty-five cases were successful in the control of intraoperative bleeding using uterine packing. Two patients with severe placenta accreta had hemorrhage during cesarean section, and packing with gauze in the uterine cavity was not able to control the bleeding, thereby resulting in cesarean hysterectomy. One case demonstrated failure in packing because of disseminated intravascular coagulation occurring before hospital admission. The remaining two patients had massive vaginal bleeding after uterine packing in cesarean section and underwent laparotomy or hysterectomy 4 h postoperative.Uterine packing is a safe and effective technique in the control of intractable hemorrhage in cesarean section. It is a reasonable alternative to further surgical intervention in patients with intractable obstetric hemorrhage, especially in developing countries.",

There were 108 patients with ongoing pregnancies until delivery and 67 patients with inevitable miscarriages. Control group included 70 pregnant women. Serum concentrations of progesterone and \u03b2-HCG were measured by Microparticle enzyme immunoassay between the fourth and fifth gestational weeks. The discrimination attained between the two study groups (ongoing pregnancies and inevitable miscarriages) was evaluated by logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.The mean serum levels of progesterone and \u03b2-HCG in patients with inevitable miscarriages (13.76 \u00b1 5.52 ng/ml, 3,647.00 \u00b1 2,123.00 mIU/ml, respectively) were significantly lower than these levels in normal intrauterine pregnancies (31.67 \u00b1 5.86 ng/ml, 13,437.00 \u00b1 6,256.00 mIU/ml, respectively) and ongoing pregnancies (25.47 \u00b1 6.18 ng/ml, 8,492.00 \u00b1 2,389.00 mIU/ml, respectively) (P < 0.001). Serum progesterone combined with \u03b2-HCG measurements, with a diagnostic accuracy of 85.7% (sensitivity 88.1%, specificity 84.3%), had the best prognostic reliability and significant differences were found when this parameter was compared with the predictive value of a single progesterone (diagnostic accuracy 72.5%, sensitivity 76.1%, specificity 70.4%) or \u03b2-HCG (diagnostic accuracy 74.8%, sensitivity 64.1%, specificity 81.4%) determinations. A combination of two biochemical parameters shows substantial improvement over a single-marker strategy.Progesterone combined with \u03b2-HCG measurements may be useful for predicting the outcome of threatened miscarriage.",

The majority of previous literature has mainly focused on evaluation the effect of progesterone on pregnancy outcome of threatened abortion. No controlled epidemiological studies of obstetric and perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth, pregnancy complications and low birth weight newborns, in pregnant women with progesterone treatment have been published. The data of 523 pregnant women with progesterone treatment in the second and third months of pregnancy due to threatened abortion was compared with the data of other 21,054 pregnant women in the Department of Obstetrics, West China Second University Hospital for a period of 6years from January 2002 to October 2008. There was no difference in mean gestational age at delivery and birth weight, in addition the rate of preterm birth, pregnancy complications and low birth weight newborns. Intramuscular progesterone treatment due to threatened abortion during early pregnancy did not associate with a higher risk for pregnancy complications, preterm birth and low birth weight newborns.",

        "abstract": "Probenazole (PBZ; 3-allyloxy-1,2-benzisothiazole-1,1-dioxide) is a highly effective chemical inducer of systemic-acquired resistance (SAR). It has been used widely to protect rice plants against the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea. Previous studies have shown that PBZ induces SAR through enhanced accumulation of salicylic acid (SA). Plants synthesize SA by either a pathway that uses phenylalanine as substrate or another that involves isochorismate. To clarify how SA is produced in PBZ-treated Arabidopsis, we examined the expression patterns and enzyme activities of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and isochorismate synthase (ICS), which are the main components of the phenylalanine and isochorismate pathways, respectively. PBZ exposure significantly improved the accumulation of SA and increased ICS activity. In the sid2-2 mutant, which has a defect in ICS1, PBZ had no effect on the level of endogenous SA or activity of ICS. In contrast, PAL activity and the expression of most PAL genes were down-regulated by such treatment in wild-type plants. These results suggest that SA is mainly synthesized via the ICS-mediated pathway in Arabidopsis. \u00a9 2010 The Botanical Society of Korea.",

The surface morphologies, tensile strength, Shaw hardness, cross-linking density and glass temperature were examined. Positron annihilation lifetime spectrum analysis (PALS) was performed to reveal the damage mechanisms of the rubber. The results showed that the tensile strength and Shaw hardness of the rubber increased firstly and then decreased with increasing the irradiation fluence. The PALS characteristics \u03c43 and I3, as well as the free volume Vf, decreased with increasing the irradiation fluence up to 1015cm\u22122, and then increased slowly. It was noticed that the proton irradiation caused a decrease in the free volume of the methyl silicone rubber when the fluence was less than 1015 cm\u22122, while the free volume increased at the fluence greater than 1015cm\u22122. The results on cross-linking density indicated that the cross-linking induced by proton irradiation was dominant under smaller proton fluencies, increasing the tensile strength and Shaw hardness of the rubber, while the degradation of the rubber dominated under greater fluencies, leading to decreasing the tensile strength and Shaw hardness.",

        "abstract": "The world-class coal-hosted Ge ore deposits of Wulantuga (Inner Mongolia) and Lincang (Yunnan Province) in China display unusually high concentrations of some trace elements, including Be, Ge, As, Sb, Nb, W, and U. In coal, these elements may be associated with the macerals and/or with the inorganic fraction (e.g., minerals and amorphous phases). Distinguishing among different associations is important for practical applications, but still challenging. In this study, an  in situ  electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) technique was applied in order to map the distribution of both light elements (C, O, and S) and selected trace elements (Wulantuga: Ge, W, and As; Lincang: Ge, W, As, and U) in the high-Ge lignite samples and their low-temperature ashes (LTAs). The EPMA detection limit was stable for these light and trace elements commonly associated with organic matter, so that reliable point analysis data were acquired for individual macerals. Additional mineralogical and geochemical data were obtained by petrographic microscopy, XRD, EDS, and ICP-MS analyses. WDS  in situ  element mapping and point analysis demonstrate that the huminite in the Wulantuga coal has a lower C content and higher O and S contents relative to inertinite, and Ge, As, and W show a preferential enrichment in huminite. Among the different huminite macerals in both the Wulantuga and Lincang coals, Ge, As, W, and U tend to occur in more compact huminites (ulminite or gelinite), and their abundances show mild to considerable variations across the compact huminites. The  in situ  concentrations of Ge and W display a direct correlation, suggesting their co-affiliation with organic matter. Elements such as Ge, W, and U have a considerable organic affinity, with a minor fraction associated with inorganic S-rich phases, such as iron sulfide/sulfate (e.g., pyrite and copiapite). Arsenic has a mixed affinity to organic matter and iron sulfide/sulfate. No Ge minerals have been detected in the LTAs, and Ge in the LTAs is likely to exist in an inorganically amorphous state. This study could provide new perspectives on the modes of occurrence of trace elements concerned in the coal-hosted germanium ore deposits in China.",

        "title": "Mississippian anthracites in Guangxi Province, southern China: Petrological, mineralogical, and rare earth element evidence for high-temperature solutions",
        "abstract": "Abstract   Minerals and elements in coal are derived from the processes associated with peat accumulation and rank advance, as well as possibly a range of epigenetic processes, and thus can provide information on the depositional conditions and geologic history of coal beds and coal-bearing sequences, as well as perhaps on regional tectonics. This paper investigates the petrology, mineralogy, and geochemistry of anthracites and their host rocks (partings, roof, and floor strata) from two coal deposits (Hongmao and Luocheng) in Guangxi Province, southern China. Samples collected from these deposits were analyzed using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy plus energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, low-temperature ashing, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, and quadrupole-based inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.  The anthracites from the two deposits are medium- to high-sulfur coals. The rare earth elements in the Luocheng anthracites are characterized by distinct positive Eu anomalies and medium- and heavy-REE enrichment types. The minerals in the Hongmao anthracites are characterized by the occurrence of K-illite, paragonite, and ammonian illite, which, however, are absent in the Luocheng anthracites. The paragonite, ammonian illite, and chlorite resulted from the alteration of pre-existing kaolinite by hot solutions containing Na + , NH 4  + , and Fe 2+  respectively. The partings in the Luocheng anthracite seams contain pyrophyllite that was formed by reactions between kaolinite and quartz during injection of high-temperature solutions. The mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of the anthracites in the two deposits indicate that the coals were subjected to high-temperature (u003e250\u202f\u00b0C) solutions that also elevated the coal rank to anthracite grade. The assemblage of K-illite-paragonite-NH 4 -illite in the coals of the Hongmao deposit was formed under greater hydrothermal but less tectonic influence compared to the Luocheng deposit; by contrast, the pyrophyllite-illite-chlorite assemblage of the Luocheng deposit reflects a greater tectonic but lesser hydrothermal influence.",

        "title": "Ammonium lactate production by Lactobacillus lactis BME5-18M in pH-controlled fed-batch fermentations",
        "abstract": "A process for efficient production of ammonium lactate by Lactobacillus lactis BME5-18M in pH-controlled fed-batch fermentation was developed. Effects of pH on the production of biomass and ammonium lactate in batch culture were studied at first. When the pH of the medium was maintained at 6.5, the highest biomass concentration and ammonium lactate production was obtained. The ammonium lactate production was remarkably improved by continuous feeding of glucose, when its residual concentration was between 5 and 10 g l \u22121 . Controlling the pH at 6.5 during the fed-batch fermentation under a constant feeding rate of 25 ml h \u22121 , the final concentration of 161.2 g ammonium lactate per liter was obtained, and the maximal cell dry weight and average ammonium lactate productivity obtained were 2.15 g DW l \u22121 and 2.02 g l \u22121 h \u22121 , respectively. Keywords Ammonium lactate Fed-batch Fermentation Glucose feeding Lactobacillus pH control 1 Introduction Lactic acid can be obtained via a chemical or a fermentation process. Fermentative production has the advantage that by choosing a strain producing only one of the isomers, an optically pure product can be obtained, whereas synthetic production always results in a racemic mixture of lactic acid [1] . The fermentation is either set at the beginning and then left to decrease due to acid production, or it is controlled by base titration [2] , or by extraction [3] , adsorption [4] , or electrodialysis [5] of lactic acid. When the lactic acid produced was neutralized by ammonium, ammonium lactate was obtained. Ammonium lactate is a nutrient that can be assimilated by rumen bacteria, and therefore is an animal feed [6] . In addition, ammonium lactate reacts with ethanol to give green solvent, ethyl lactate [7] . For the batch culture of lactic acid bacteria, the best results obtained in the published paper are: 58.9 g l \u22121 for the final ammonium lactate concentration [8] , 95.4% for the ammonium lactate yield [9] , and 0.45 g l \u22121 h \u22121 for the volumetric productivity [9] . Therefore, final concentration of ammonium lactate and the productivity previously reported was relatively low from an industrial point of view [8\u201310] . Fermentation by lactic acid bacteria is normally accompanied by increased cell mass if the aim of the process is lactate production [1] . Fed-batch culture is commonly used in microbial fermentation. This method may lead to a high cell density because substrate limitation or inhibition can be avoided by maintaining medium substrate concentration at a low level during cultivation. However, as far as we know, until now there are no reports on fed-batch fermentation for high cell density and efficient production of ammonium lactate by lactic acid bacteria. The aim of the present study was to develop a high cell density fed-batch process for enhanced production of ammonium lactate by Lactobacillus BME5-18M. Effect of the pH of the medium during batch fermentation on the cell growth and production of ammonium lactate was investigated at first in order to enhance the final cell density and productivity of ammonium lactate. By using a low level of initial glucose and its continuous feeding during fermentation, the inhibitory effects of a relatively higher level of initial glucose on the ammonium lactate production was avoided, and the process efficiency was greatly enhanced. This work is useful to the large-scale fermentation of Lactobacillus lactis BME5-18M for production of ammonium lactate. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Microorganism and inocula preparation The L. lactis BME5-18M (screened by this research group and maintained at Bioreaction & Metabolic Engineering Lab, Tianjin University, PR China) was used for all experiments. Stock cultures were maintained at \u221280 \u00b0C in Lactibacilli deMan Rogosa Sharpe (MRS) [11] medium containing 50% (v/v) glycerol solution until ready to use. To prepare the inoculum for fermentation experiments, one glycerol stock vial was removed from freezer, shortly thawed, and then used to inoculate a 250 ml conical flask containing 150 ml MRS medium. Precultures were grown in MRS broth at 37 \u00b0C with shaking at 150 rpm for 24 h. At least three generations of precultures were required before fermentation. The inoculum was centrifuged (10,000 rpm, 15 min) before use and then suspended in sterile fresh production medium. The optical density of lactic cell suspensions was measured at 660 nm and adjusted to same cell dry weight (DW) in order to give same final inoculated cell concentration of 0.06 g DW l \u22121 for all fermentation experiments. 2.2 Batch and fed-batch fermentation in stirred tank fermentor Batch and fed-batch fermentation were performed in a 5 l fermentor (Biostat B, B. Braun, Germany) with a working volume of 3 l. The basic medium for fermentations consisted of (per liter of distilled water) 0.2 g MgSO 4 \u00b77H 2 O, 0.01 g MnSO 4 \u00b77H 2 O, 0.01 g FeSO 4 \u00b77H 2 O, 0.01 g NaCl, 1.0 g sodium acetate, 2.0 g triammonium citrate, 2.0 g K 2 HPO 4 \u00b77H 2 O, 2.0 g KH 2 PO 4 \u00b77H 2 O, 1 ml polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono-oleate (Tween 80) and 150 g of glucose for batch fermentation or 50 g of the initial glucose for fed-batch fermentation. Fed-batch fermentation was carried out in two phases. In the first phase, the L. lactis BME5-18M cells were grown in batch mode in a 5 l fermentor (Biostat B, B. Braun, Germany) with a working volume of 2.5 l (The production medium contains 50 g l \u22121 glucose) until the residual glucose concentration decreased to 5\u201310 g l \u22121 , which was predicted from previous batch fermentations and confirmed by off-line assay. In the second phase, a fed-batch process with a continuous feeding of 500 ml of highly concentrated glucose solution (600 g l \u22121 ) into reactor at different feeding rate was conducted. During batch and fed-batch cultivation, agitation speed was 100 rpm and the culture temperature was conducted at 37 \u00b0C. No aeration was used. The pH of the process was monitored using a pH sensor (Mettler Toledo, Switzerland) and automatically maintained at varied pH as investigated by addition of 5 M NH 4 OH. Samples were taken every 4 h and the cell density, glucose consumption and ammonium lactate production and productivity were compared to evaluate the process efficiency of the different fermentation mode. The reactor fermentation under each condition was repeated, and the data shown represent the mean values. 2.3 Analytical methods Three milliliters of the fermentation broth was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm (PM180R, ALC, Italy) for 15 min and the sediment was then suspended into 3 ml physiological saline solution, which is used to determine the cell growth. To measure cell growth a UV-Vis TU-1800 spectrophotometer (Pgeneral, China) was used at 660 nm. The concentration of cell mass, expressed as dry weight per liter, was determined in selected sample. A linear relationship between the optical density (OD) and cell density was observed. One OD unit corresponds to 0.31 g l \u22121 of cell mass. The supernatant liquor was used to determine the sugar and lactic acid concentration by HPLC as previously reported [12] . The lactic acid concentration was then converted to the concentration of ammonium lactate. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effect of pH control on the production of biomass and ammonium lactate In order to investigate the effect of different pH levels on the production of biomass and ammonium lactate in the course of batch fermentation, the initial pH was set at 7.5. Then the pH of the medium was maintained at 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0 and 7.5, respectively, with 5 M NH 4 OH after the pH dropped to these points due to the production of lactic acid. Table 1 shows the effect of different levels on the production of biomass and ammonium lactate. The accumulation of lactic acid is correlated to the increase of biomass. Low levels of biomass and ammonium lactate were synthesized at pH values lower than 5.5. This effect could have resulted from partial loss of the activity of some enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of biomass and lactic acid. The result showed that a highest level of ammonium lactate was obtained when pH was maintained constant at 6.5. 3.2 Batch and fed-batch fermentation in stirred tank fermentor Batch culture of L. lactis BME5-18M for production of ammonium lactate from glucose (150 g l \u22121 ) with pH control at 6.5 was carried out in stirred tank fermentor. As shown in Fig. 1 , after a lag-phase of 12 h, the cells started to enter the exponential growth phase. Cell dry weight reached the highest (1.56 g DW l \u22121 ) at 80 h. The result clearly demonstrated that lactic acid production by L. lactis BME5-18M was predominantly growth-associated. This result is consistent with those obtained in batch culture using a complex or a defined medium [13,14] . The concentration of the residual glucose and ammonium lactate were 21.7 and 150.2 g l \u22121 , respectively, after 112 h fermentation. The yield and productivity of ammonium lactate are 100% and 1.34 g l \u22121 h \u22121 . After 112 h, glucose did not decrease and ammonium lactate production did not increase any more. This effect could have resulted from the inhibition of the accumulated product, ammonium lactate, on the biosynthesis of biomass and lactic acid. Five hundred milliliters of the concentrated glucose solution (600 g l \u22121 ) was pumped into the fermentor at a feeding rate of 15, 25, 35, 45 and 55 ml h \u22121 up to total volume of 3 l. As shown in Fig. 2 , the maximum cell density, the average growth rate, the ammonium lactate productivity and yield increased slightly with an increase in feeding rate from 15 to 25 ml h \u22121 , but decreased at higher feeding rate (25\u201355 ml h \u22121 ) although the feeding rate almost did not influence the lag time of the cell growth. The highest concentration of ammonium lactate (161.2 g l \u22121 ) was obtained at feeding rate of 25 ml h \u22121 after 80 h of incubation. It was clear that substrate addition during the fermentation enhanced the biomass accumulation. Fig. 3 shows the kinetics of fed-batch production of ammonium lactate under a constant feeding rate of 25 ml h \u22121 . As shown in Fig. 3 , during the course of fed-batch fermentation, the dry cell weight increased rapidly while the growth of the microorganisms entered the logarithmic phase. The lag time of cell growth, 2\u20134 h, is shorter than the batch culture lag time (12 h). This could have resulted from the high osmotic pressure of the cells in the batch culture condition. The highest maximum cell growth (2.15 g DW l \u22121 ) was obtained after 48 h of fermentation. The fed-batch culture showed 130% improvement in cell growth rate compared with the batch culture. The production of the biomass and ammonium lactate slowed after 60 h. The fermentation time, 80 h, is 28% shorter than the batch culture fermentation time. The concentration of residual glucose decreased in batch fermentation ( Fig. 1 ), while it was increased during fed-batch culture ( Fig. 3 ) (except at feeding rate of 15 ml h \u22121 ). Compared with the batch culture, the fed-batch culture showed 7.3% improvement in ammonium lactate production, 37.8% improvement in cell dry weight and 50.4% improvement in productivity. By increasing the feeding rate from 15 to 45 ml h \u22121 , a significant rise in the residual glucose concentration was obtained after 80 h of incubation (data not shown). Similar to the results in batch fermentation, glucose did not decrease and ammonium lactate did not increase any more in fed-batch fermentation after 80 h culture.

        "abstract": "Abstract.  During the APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) Economic Leadersu0027 2014 Summit in Beijing, strict regional air emission controls were implemented, providing a unique opportunity to investigate the transport and formation mechanism of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ). This study explores the use of vertical observation methods to investigate the influence of regional transport on PM 2.5  pollution in Beijing before and during the APEC Summit. Vertical profiles of extinction coefficient, wind, temperature and relative humidity were monitored at a rural site on the border of Beijing and Hebei Province. Three PM 2.5  pollution episodes were analyzed. In episode\u00a01 (27\u00a0October to 1\u00a0November), regional transport accompanied by the accumulation of pollutants under unfavorable meteorological conditions led to the pollution. In episode\u00a02 (2\u20135\u00a0November), pollutants left from episode\u00a01 were retained in the boundary layer of the region for 2\u00a0days and then settled down to the surface, leading to an explosive increase of PM 2.5 . The regional transport of aged aerosols played a crucial role in the heavy PM 2.5  pollution. In episode\u00a03 (6\u201311\u00a0November), emissions from large point sources had been controlled for several days while primary emissions from diesel vehicles might have led to the pollution. It is found that ground-level observation of meteorological conditions and air quality could not fully explain the pollution process, while vertical parameters (aerosol optical properties, winds, relative humidity and temperature) improved the understanding of regional transport influence on heavy pollution processes. Future studies may consider including vertical observations to aid investigation of pollutant transport, especially during episodic events of rapidly increasing concentrations.",

The results showed that the annual concentration of O1h was increasing with a growth rate of 4.40 \u03bcg\u00b7m while the annual concentration of O8h was decreasing with annual average rates of -1.0 \u03bcg\u00b7m and -1.5 \u03bcg\u00b7m from May to October in 2004 and 2015. Over the past 3 years, number of O8h severe pollution days increased significantly and the situation of O pollution in Beijing became more serious. O concentration reached its peak in June in a year and its diurnal peak concentration occurred at about 15:00-18:00 at Dingling station which was 101-1.56 times larger than that in the urban center of Beijing. In different years, the ozone peak concentration at Dingling Station was 1h later than that in the urban center from May to October in diurnal variation and the difference of peak concentration was significantly reduced in recent years, which on the one hand may be related to regional ozone pollution, on the other hand may be related to the expansion of Beijing's urbanization.",

Judging from the size of Mo4O11 and its orientation relationship with MoO2, we believe that the formation of Mo4O11 is due to the reaction between MoO2 and the untransformed MoO3.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This study set out to gain a deeper understanding of a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) coprocessing approach using canola oil mixed with bitumen-derived heavy gas oil (HGO), for the production of partially-renewable gasoline, with respect to its composition and quality. The FCC coprocessing approach may provide an alternative solution to reducing the carbon footprint and to meet government regulatory demands for renewable transportation fuels. In this study, a mixture of 15 v% canola oil in HGO was catalytically cracked with a commercial equilibrium catalyst under typical FCC conditions. Cracking experiments were performed using a bench-scale Advanced Cracking Evaluation (ACE) unit at a fixed weight hourly space velocity of 8 h \u22121 , 490\u2013530\u00a0\u00b0C, and catalyst/oil ratios of 4\u201312\u00a0g/g. The total liquid product samples were injected via an automatic sampler and a prefractionator (to remove +254\u00a0\u00b0C) into a gas chromatographic system containing a series of columns, traps, and valves designed to separate each of the hydrocarbon types. The analyzer gives detailed hydrocarbon types of \u2212200\u00a0\u00b0C gasoline, classified into paraffins, iso-paraffins, olefins, naphthenes, and aromatics by carbon number up to C 11  (C 10  for aromatics). For a feed cracked at a given temperature, the gasoline aromatics show the highest selectivity in terms of weight percent conversion, followed by saturated iso-paraffins, saturated naphthenes, unsaturated iso-paraffins, unsaturated naphthenes, unsaturated normal paraffins, and saturated normal paraffins. As conversion increases, both aromatics and saturated iso-paraffins increase monotonically at the expense of other components. Hydrocarbon type analysis and octane numbers with variation in feed type, process severity (temperature and catalyst/oil ratio), and conversion are also presented and discussed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Coprocessing of bitumen-derived feeds and biomass through a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) route has the potential to assist in the reduction of fuel and petroleum product carbon footprints while meeting government regulatory requirements on renewable transportation fuels. This approach is desirable because green house gas (GHG) emissions for producing renewable biofuels are significantly lower than those for fossil fuels, and coprocessing can be executed using existing refining infrastructure to save capital cost. The present study investigates the specific FCC performances of pure heavy gas oil (HGO) derived from oil sands synthetic crude, and a mixture of 15 v% canola oil in HGO using a commercial equilibrium catalyst under typical FCC conditions. Cracking experiments were performed using a bench-scale Advanced Cracking Evaluation (ACE) unit at fixed weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 8\u00a0h \u22121 , 490\u2013530\u00a0\u00b0C, and catalyst/oil ratios of 4\u201312\u00a0g/g. This work focuses on some cracking phenomena resulting from the presence of oxygen in the blend\u2014a lower heat requirement for cracking due to the exothermic water formation, which also entails lower hydrogen yield at a given severity. The distribution of feed oxygen in gaseous and liquid products, the mitigation in GHG emissions, and the technological and economical advantages of the coprocessing option are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "The structure evolution characteristics of high-organic-sulfur (HOS) coals with a wide range of ranks from typical Chinese areas were investigated using 13C-CP/MAS NMR. The results indicate that the structure parameters that are relevant to coal rank include CH3 carbon (fal*), quaternary carbon, CH/CH2 carbon + quaternary carbon (falH), aliphatic carbon (falC), protonated aromatic carbon (faH), protonated aromatic carbon + aromatic bridgehead carbon (faH+B), aromaticity (faCP), and aromatic carbon (farC). The coal structure changed dramatically in the first two coalification jumps, especially the first one. A large number of aromatic structures condensed, and aliphatic structures rapidly developed at the initial stage of bituminous coal accompanied by remarkable decarboxylation. Compared to ordinary coals, the structure evolution characteristics of HOS coals manifest in three ways: First, the aromatic CH3 carbon, alkylated aromatic carbon (faS), aromatic bridgehead carbon (faB), and phenolic ether (faP) are barely relevant to rank, and abundant organic sulfur has an impact on the normal evolution process of coal. Second, the average aromatic cluster sizes of some super-high-organic-sulfur (SHOS) coals are not large, and the extensive development of cross bonds and/or bridged bonds form closer connections among the aromatic fringes. Moreover, sulfur-containing functional groups are probably significant components in these linkages. Third, a considerable portion of \u201coxygen-containing functional groups\u201d in SHOS coals determined by 13C-NMR are actually sulfur-containing groups, which results in the anomaly that the oxygen-containing structures increase with coal rank.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To predict the effect of the liquid rocket engine combustion chamber conditions on the impingement spray, the conventional uncoupled spray model for impinging injectors is extended by considering the coupling of the jet impingement process and the ambient gas field. The new coupled model consists of the plain-orifice sub-model, the jet-jet impingement sub-model and the droplet collision sub-model. The parameters of the child droplet are determined with the jet-jet impingement sub-model using correlations about the liquid jet parameters and the chamber conditions. The overall model is benchmarked under various impingement angles, jet momentum and off-center ratios. Agreement with the published experimental data validates the ability of the model to predict the key spray characteristics, such as the mass flux and mixture ratio distributions in quiescent air. Besides, impinging sprays under changing ambient pressure and non-uniform gas flow are investigated to explore the effect of liquid rocket engine chamber conditions. First, a transient impingement spray during engine start-up phase is simulated with prescribed pressure profile. The minimum average droplet diameter is achieved when the orifices work in cavitation state, and is about 30% smaller than the steady single phase state. Second, the effect of non-uniform gas flow produces off-center impingement and the rotated spray fan by 38\u00b0. The proposed model suggests more reasonable impingement spray characteristics than the uncoupled one and can be used as the first step in the complex simulation of coupling impingement spray and combustion in liquid rocket engines.",

        "abstract": "The numerical simulation of the ignition process of the monomethyl hydrazine\u2013nitrogen tetroxide attitude-control thrusters is difficult because of the complex hypergolic gas\u2013liquid chemical reaction between the propellants. To calculate the thruster ignition delay accurately, a 36-step gas-phase chemical kinetics model and a one-step finite-rate liquid-phase hypergolic reaction are proposed. These chemical mechanisms are integrated into the Euler\u2013Lagrange-based transient spray combustion simulation platform. The calculated ignition pressure curve of a 2\u00a0kN thruster coincides well with that from the experiment. The numerical and experimental ignition delays are 2.4 and 3.1\u00a0ms, respectively. A parameter study shows that the liquid-phase reaction at the propellant impingement points consumes 22\u201344% propellant and provides energy to heat the gas mixtures, which is essential for a successful gas-phase ignition. The lower limit of ignition delay was estimated as 1.5\u00a0ms under design restrictions for most thrusters.",

A Cr/Cr2N film was prepared by magnetron sputtering on the uranium to improve its corrosion resistance. The Cr/Cr2N film exhibits modulation structure. The introduction of the Cr/Cr2N increases the corrosion potential; the corresponding current density decreases about three orders of magnitude. After polarization corrosion, the surface morphology of the Cr/Cr2N-coated on uranium keeps integrated. Only a thin layer of film (~40nm) is oxidized.

High gene expression level of the G(q)-coupled P2Y(1) nucleotide receptor in PC-3 prostate cancer cells was demonstrated using real-time quantitative PCR and confirmed by Western blotting and confocal laser scanning microscopy. A selective P2Y(1) receptor agonist, the ADP analogue MRS2365, concentration-dependently induced intracellular calcium mobilization (EC(50) 5.28nM), which was diminished by P2Y(1) receptor-selective antagonist MRS2500. P2Y(1) receptor activation by MRS2365 induced apoptosis in assays of Caspase-3, LDH release, and annexin-V staining. The pro-apoptotic effect of MRS2365 was blocked by MRS2500, P2Y(1) siRNA, and an inhibitor of the MAP kinase pathway PD98059. MRS2365 significantly inhibited the proliferation of PC-3 cells, examined using a MTT assay. Thus, activation of the P2Y(1) receptor induced cell death and inhibited growth of human prostatic carcinoma PC-3 cells. Activation of the P2Y(1) receptor should be a novel and promising therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer.",

The A2B AR gene expression quantified by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis was the highest among four AR subtypes (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) in all three commonly used prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3, DU145, and LNCaP. We explored the function of the A2B AR using PC-3 cells as a model. The A2B AR was visualized in PC-3 cells by laser confocal microscopy. The nonselective A2B AR agonist NECA and the selective A2B AR agonist BAY60-6583, but not the A2A AR agonist CGS21680, concentration-dependently induced adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) accumulation. NECA diminished lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, TNF-\u03b1-induced increase of caspase-3 activity, and cycloheximide (CHX)-induced morphological changes typical of apoptosis in PC-3 cells, which were blocked by a selective A2B AR antagonist PSB603. NECA-induced proliferation of PC-3 cells was diminished by siRNA specific for the A2B AR. The selective A2B AR antagonist PSB603 was shown to inhibit cell growth in all three cell lines. Thus, A2B AR blockade inhibits growth of prostate cancer cells, suggesting selective A2B AR antagonists as potential novel therapeutics.",

Methods: KG1\u03b1 cells at logarithmic phase were divided into two groups. The cells in blank control group were subjected to routine culture, while those in test group were incubated with Rh2 (S) at various concentrations. The cells were determined for proliferative activity by MTT method, observed for morphology and count under invert microscope and for ultrastructure under transmission electron microscope, and determined for distribution of cell cycles by flow cytometry, for \u03b2-catenin mRNA level by Real-time PCR, for location and expression of \u03b2-catenin, TCF4, and cyclinD1 by immunocytochemical method, and for expression levels of the proteins by Western blot. Results: Rh2 (S) inhibited the proliferation of KG1\u03b1 cells significantly, in dose- and time-dependent manners. Compared with those in blank control, the KG1\u03b1 cells 48 h after treatment with 0.04 g/L Rh2 (S) grew in scatter, of which the count decreased significantly. Cells at different counts and apoptosis levels were observed. The percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase increased significantly (P < 0.05), while those in G2 + M and S phases decreased significantly (P < 0.05). The \u03b2-catenin mRNA level (P < 0.01) and the expression levels of \u03b2-catenin, TCF4 and cyclinD1 protein decreased significantly (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Conclusion: Ginsenoside Rh2 (S) inhibited the proliferation of KG1\u03b1 cells significantly by a possible mechanism of inhibiting Wnt/\u03b2-catenin/TCF4/CyclinD1 signaling pathway thus causing cell cycle arrest and inducing cell apoptosis.",
