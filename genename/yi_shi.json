        "abstract": "Objectives To evaluate the accuracy of four existing risk stratification models including the Society of Thoracic Surgeons(STS) 2008 Cardiac Surgery Risk Models for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(CABG),the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation(EuroSCORE),the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association(ACC/AHA) model,and the initial Parsonnet's score in predicting early deaths of Chinese patients after CABG procedure. Methods We collected clinical records of 1 559 consecutive patients who had undergone isolated CABG in the Fu Wai Hospital from November 2006 to December 2007.There were 264 females(16.93%) and 1 295 males(83.06%) with an average age of 60.87\u00b19.06 years.Early death was defined as death in-hospital or within 30 days after CABG.Calibration was assessed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow(H-L) test,and discrimination was assessed by the receiver-operating-characteristic(ROC) curve.The endpoint was early death. Results Sixteen patients(1.03%) died early after the operation.STS and ACC/AHA models had a good calibration in predicting the number of early deaths for the whole group(STS: 12.06 deaths,95% confidence interval(CI) 5.28 to 18.85;ACC/AHA:20.67 deaths,95%CI 11.82 to 29.52),While EuroSCORE and Parsonnet models overestimated the number of early deaths for the whole group(EuroSCORE:36.44 deaths,95%CI 24.75 to 48.14;Parsonnet:43.87 deaths,95%CI 31.07 to 56.67).For the divided groups,STS model had a good calibration of prediction(\u03c72=11.46,P>0.1),while the other 3 models showed poor calibration(EuroSCORE:\u03c72=22.07,P<0.005;ACC/AHA:\u03c72=28.85,P<0.005;Parsonnet:\u03c72=26.74,P<0.005).All the four models showed poor discrimination with area under the ROC curve lower than 0.8. Conclusion The STS model may be a potential appropriate choice for Chinese patients undergoing isolated CABG procedure.",

The diameter of the ascending aorta was measured before and early after surgery and then later between 4 and 78 months [mean (36 +/- 25) months] postoperatively using echocardiography.The reduction aortoplasty decreased the diameter of the aorta from (4.8 +/- 0.5) cm preoperatively to (3.6 +/- 0.4) cm early after surgery (P < 0.01). During follow-up, the diameter of aorta increased from (3.6 +/- 0.4) cm early after surgery to (3.7 +/- 0.4) cm after a mean follow-up of (36 +/- 25) months (P < 0.05).Reduction aortoplasty shows good mid-term results in patients with aortic valve disease and dilatation of the ascending aorta.

Methods Between January 2005 and May 2005, 507 patients undergoing valvular surgery were examined retrospectively. Multiple perioperative factors were evaluated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. PRF was defined as mechanical ventilation lasting for more than 48 hours after operation or reintubation and mechanical ventilation 6 hours later after extubation. Results Thirty-one patients(6.1%) developed PRF. Univariate risk factors included age(P<0.001), history of cardiac surgery(P= 0.005) , NYHA functional class III or IV(P=0.020), C/T(P<0.001), valvular disease with coronary artery disease(P=0.016), preoperative pulmonary dysfunction(P<0.05), plasma albumin<35g/L(P=0.010), combined with coronary artery bypass grafting(P=0.038), cardiopulmonary(CPB) time(P=0.001), aortic cross-clamping time(P<0.001), secondary CPB support (P= 0.001), low ratio of arterial oxygen tension to inspired oxygen fraction (PaO_2/FiO_2) at ICU 2h postoperatively(P< 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified that age\u226565 years(odds ratio 6.250), preoperative maximal voluntary ventilation(MVV) practical/predictive% <71%(odds ratio 26.316), secondary CPB support (odds ratio 4.425), the second hour PaO_2/FiO_2 <300 mmHg (odds ratio 90.909) at ICU were risk factors.

        "abstract": "Objective To compare the efficacy of one kind of modified De Vega technique and traditional De Vega technique. Methods From January 2002 to August 2005, 70 patients were treated with tricuspid valve plasty. These patients were divided into modified De Vega annuloplasty group and traditional De Vega annuloplasty group randomly before operation. The tricuspid regurgitation (TR) were functional and secondary in all patients. The grade of TR and New York Heart Association(NYHA) functional class of two groups were analyzed by Ridit analysis. The changes of right ventricular end-diastolic dimension of two groups were analyzed by paired-sample t test. Results There was no statistically difference between two groups about preoperative characteristics. The follow-up time of modified De Vega annuloplasty group was 12.91\u00b18.84 months and that of traditional De Vega annuloplasty group was 13.61\u00b111.21 months. There was no significant difference between two groups. The outcome of follow-up was satisfactory. In modified De Vega annuloplasty group, there were 12 patient with no TR, 17 patient with mild TR, and 6 patients with moderate TR. There was no patient with severe TR. In traditional De Vega annuloplasty group, 7 patients were observed with no TR, 19 patients mild TR, 7 patients moderate TR and 2 patients severe TR. In modified De Vega annuloplasty group, 32 patients were in NYHA class \u2160, 2 patients in NYHA class \u2161and only 1 patient in NYHA class \u2162. As for traditional De Vega annuloplasty group, 31 patients were in NYHA class \u2160, 2 patients in NYHA class \u2161and 2 patients in NYHA class \u2162. The Ridit analysis showed that there was no significant difference about NYHA class between two groups. However, the difference of TR between two groups was statistically significant(P<0.05). The outcome of modified De Vega annuloplasty was superior to that of traditional De Vega technique. Paired-sample t test demonstrated that the modified De Vega annuloplasty could reduce the right ventricular end-diastolic dimension significantly (P<0.05). However, the right ventricular end-diastolic dimension of traditional De Vega annuloplasty groups did not change significantly (P>0.05).

        "abstract": "Objective \" One-stop\" hybrid coronary revascularization has emerged to be a reliable and attractive solution in the international cardiovascular field for selective patients with multivessel coronary artery disease.However,so far,there has been neither midterm nor long term angiogram result of the surgery.This study seeks to analyze our midterm angiogram results of the \"one-stop\" hybrid coronary revascularization.Methods Between October 2010 and December 2011,42 patients(mean age was 64.3\u00b19.6 years,ranging from 54 to 77) including 37 males and 5 females,were enrolled in the present study and underwent a postoperative angiography after surgery(18 months on average).The angiograms were assessed visually and quantitatively.There were 19 cases in New York Heart Association NYHA 1,23 cases in NYHA 2..Clinical and angiographic follow-up lasted 18\u00b1 8.9 months.Results:There was no MACCE in all 42 cases.While LIMA bypass showed the best result in all conduits(95.2%,40/42),Drug eluting stent(DES) resulted in a patency of 82.7%(43/52).One LIMA graft occlude and was treated with DES when followed up.Two target vessels with stent restenosis and 3 new target vessels were retreated with stents when followed up.Conclusions:Our angiography showed that the left internal mammary artery(LIMA) graft patency of one-stop hybrid revascularization was as good as the results of the conventional surgery.And the non-left anterior descending artery(LAD) patency resulted from DES was better than that of the saphenous vein graft.So the one-stop hybrid revascularization surgery is reasonable,safe and feasible for patients with complex coronary artery disease.",

Combined with pertinent medical cases,the hypothesis about thrombus formation here is studied and validated from all multidisciplinary angles. Method The geometry model of T-bifurcation artery is created to numerically analyze the flow field in vessel and the influence of different kinds of blood flow on thrombus formation. Result There appeared two \"larger-regional\" vortexes in the main and branch vessel near bifurcation.In addition,downstream the bifurcation joint,also appeared a smaller region,where local velocity is lower and shearing stress appears to abruptly increase,which is in favor of thrombus and could be \"location apt to thrombus\". Conclusions Thrombus formation in \"location apt to thrombus\" is also closely related with branch vessel diameter,blood velocity,bifurcation angle and blood viscosity.",

The three kingds of siRNAs targeting different gene sites (130, 214, 521) were synthetized chemically. The single-stranded RNAs were annealed to produce double-stranded siRNAs, then the mouse primary hepatocytes were transfected by oligofectamine package. The inhibition of caspase-12 was analyzed with RT-PCR and Western-blot. The viable hepatocytes following the induction of apoptosis were evaluated with MTT.All the three kinds of siRNAs could obviously inhibit normal mouse hepatocyte caspase-12 mRNA. The siRNA (214) were more effective than the other two when the concentration was 100 nmol/L. The caspase-12 mRNA expression was inhibited by 52.08%, while that of siRNA (521) was 30.73% (t=4.30, P <0.05). However when the concentration was 200 nmol/L, the inhibitions were similar (88.07%, 86.22% and 89.41% respectively). siRNA (214) could downregulate the expression of apoptotic hepatocytes procaspase-12 by 51.43% ( t=4.30, P <0.01). Contrasted with apoptotic hepatocytes, the cell activity, which was analyzed with MTT, increased by 48.76% (t=2.23, P <0.01).siRNAs could effectively downregulate the expression of caspase-12 at mRNA and protein levels and prevent mouse primary hepatocytes from apoptosis.",

Total RNA and protein of the cells, after their incubation with siRNA for 24, 48 and 72 hours, were extracted, and the supernatants were collected. The expressions of CTGF and type I and III collagen genes were detected by means of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or Western blot. Contents of hyaluronic acid and type III pro-collagen in the supernatants were determined by radioimmunoassay.The expression of CTGF at mRNA and protein level and type I and III collagen at mRNA levels were markedly down-regulated in siRNA-transfected HSCs. The contents of hyaluronic acid and type III pro-collagen in the supernatants decreased by 46%+/-7%, 52%+/-7%, 53%+/-7% and 29%+/-18%, 29%+/-7%, 27%+/-5%, compared with those of the blank control at 24, 48 and 72 hours.Chemically synthetic anti-CTGF siRNA can significantly inhibit CTGF gene expression in HSC, and markedly reduce the synthesis and secretion of ECM including type I and III collagen and hyaluronic acid. The siRNA-directed suppression of CTGF gene in HSC was maintained for 72 hours. This suggests that chemically synthetic siRNA may be a potential in preventing and treating liver fibrosis and may have a promising future for development",

Methods HepG2 and 7404 cells were treated with androgen (dihydrotestosterone) or synthetic siRNA duplexes targeting human androgen receptor and the level of AR and PEG10 were then examined by Western blot.Results Among 3 siRNA duplexes, one siRNA was picked out which could reduce AR's expression over 84% and 92% at the concentration of 240 nmol/L 24 h post-transfection in HepG2 and 7404 cells respectively. When AR was down-regulated by siRNA, the level of PEG10 was reduced in 24 h and descended to the lowest in 48 h, and increased in 72 h in HepG2 and 7404 cells. The level of PEG10 can be up-regulated by androgen in a dose-dependent manner, but the level of androgen receptor was not affected in HepG2 cells.Conclusion Androgen and AR is involved in the regulation of the PEG10's expression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, which might be one of the reasons for the higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in the male.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To determine the interfering effects of EphB4-targeted short interfering RNA (siRNA) on EphB4 mRNA expression and its effect on the growth of glioma U251 cell line. Method: EphB4-targeted siRNA was designed and synthesized, and then was transfected into U251 cells. The inhibition of EphB4 mRNA expression was detected by RT-PCR. The effect of EphB4-targeted siRNA on cell growth rate was measured by CCK-8 method. Cell apoptosis was tested by flow cytometry (FCM). Wound healing test was used to observe the migration ability of cells. The invasiveness of tumor cells was evaluated by counting the number of cells passing the Transwell membrane. Results:EphB4 mRNA transcription level was decreased by 75.0% after transfection of malignant glioma U251 cells with 100 nmol/L siRNA-EphB4. The inhibition of cell proliferation was in a dose-dependent manner. FCM analysis showed that cells were arrested at sub-G1 phase at different degrees and the migration capacity decreased after transfection with 100 nmol/L siRNA-EphB4 compared with the negative control. The number of cells permeating the matrigel membrane significantly were decreased in the siRNA-EphB4 transfection group compared with the control group. Conclusion:siRNA-EphB4 markedly targetes and knocks down EphB4 gene transcription. Down-regulation of EphB4 affects cell proliferation and induces apoptosis of cells. Transfection of siRNA-EphB4 into U251 cells inhibits the migration and invasion abilities of cells at various degrees. It indicates that silencing EphB4 expression might become a noval approach in the treatment of glioma.",

The EphA2 mRNA levels of normal brain and two glioma cell lines U251 and U87 were detected by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Then, the function of EphA2 in glioma cell line U251 was analyzed by RNAi technology. The expression level of EphA2 gene was higher in U251 and U87 cells than that in normal brain. siRNA targeting EphA2 was designed and synthesized and then the siRNA was transfected into U251 cell with a high transfection efficiency of 70.31%. 50 nmol/L of siRNA could lead to over 70.0% reduction in EphA2 protein and mRNA level detected by Western blot and RT-PCR respectively. The cell proliferation was notably attenuated and the apoptosis was significantly increased after EhpA2 was downregulated. The migration and invasion of glioma cells were also attenuated when EhpA2 was knocked down by siRNA. EphA2 plays an important role in the malignance of glioma U251 cells and may be a novel molecular marker for the malignance of the glioma cell line U251. EphA2 could be a potential target in gene therapy for glioma.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the anti-fibrogenesis property of intraportal vein injection of small interfering RNA targeting connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in a rat model of liver fibrosis and its effect on the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM).Thirty male rats were randomly divided into five groups. Some rats received CCl4 subcutaneously every three days for 6 consecutive weeks, and in the meantime they also received either siRNA targeting CTGF (preventive group), saline (model group) or siRNA (siRNA control group) by intraportal vein injections. Other rats received CCl4 by subcutaneous injection for 2 weeks, followed by CCl4 and CTGF siRNA intraportal vein injection for 4 more weeks (as treatment group). The expressions of CTGF and type I and III collagen genes were detected by means of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or Western blot respectively. Hepatic histology was evaluated by HE and Sirius red stained sections. The collagen staining areas were measured quantitatively using a computer-aided manipulator with slight modifications. Serum procollagen type III and hyaluronic acid were determined by radioimmunoassay.Six weeks after CCl4 injection, prominent upregulation of gene expressions of CTGF, type I and III collagen, and laminin in saline or siRNA-treated rat livers were observed. The expressions of CTGF at mRNA and protein level and type I and III collagen at mRNA level were markedly reduced in rats with CTGF siRNA treated for four or six weeks. Expressions of CTGF at mRNA and protein levels decreased by 76%+/-8%, 80%+/-3% (F = 68.630) and 95%+/-2%, 93%+/-3% (F = 21.234, P < 0.01); type I and III collagen and laminin at mRNA levels decreased by 74%+/-8%, 78%+/-8%, 31%+/-7% and 57%+/-6%, 59%+/-10%, 43%+/-9% (F = 24.219, 16.315, 9.716, P < 0.01) compared with rats in the model group at 72 h. The CTGF siRNA treatment markedly reduced serum levels of procollagen type III and hyaluronic acid and the degrees of liver fibrosis.Intraportal vein siRNA injection targeting CTGF could significantly inhibit CTGF gene expression in rats, thereby attenuating liver fibrosis by reducing ECM accumulation.",

Operations were performed in 16 cases, interventional procedures in 15 cases, and non-operative treatment in 2 cases respectively. The markers of neuroendocrine cell (CgA, NSE, Syn) and the main peptide hormones (insulin, gastrin, glucagon, VIP, and somatostatin) were examined in tumor samples with immunohistochemistry method.Results Group A and B were similar with respect to age (year) and tumor diameter (cm) at diagnosis (40.50\u00b112.54 vs 51.60\u00b112.85, and 8.45\u00b15.12 vs 6.26\u00b13.65, respectively; P>0.05). Positive expression of 2 or all 3 markers of neuroendocrine cell was detected in all 16 samples; negative expression of all 5 peptide hormones was observed in only 25% of samples. At a mean follow-up of 44.2 months (range 4 months-7 years ), the mean time from resection to relapse or metastasis was 29.8 months; 7 cases survived more than 5 years, of which 2 have survived for 7 years. Two cases, who subjected non-operative treatment, survired 39,61 months, respectively.Conclusions Clinical manifestations of NPNEC are non-specific.

Methods:The QBC939 and BXPC-3 cells during exponential growth stage were harvested and divided into experimental group and control group. The experimental group was separated into four sub-groups(50 \u03bcg/L 2 h,50 \u03bcg/L 24 h,100 \u03bcg/L 2 h,100 \u03bcg/L 24 h) according to the dose of GH and culture time. After 2 h and 24 h, Insulin-like Growth Factor1 was detected by using ELISA respectively. The carcinoma cells cultured for 24 h with various GH concentration(50 \u03bcg/L,100 \u03bcg/L) were made into single cell suspentions, and the samples underwent subsequent cell cycle evaluation. IGF1RmRNA was tested with the method of hybridization in vitro. Results:GH stimulated cell growth in vitro and also elevated S phase percent and proliferation index(PI) of cells after 24 h culture(P < 0.05). The quantum of IGF1 was significantly increased after 2 h culture in GH groups, but there was no statistical significance between GH groups and NS groups 24 h ago. IGF1RmRNA was expressed in two carcinoma cell lines in contrast to blank controls, and the expression boosted up according to the dose of GH. Conclusion:GH stimulates QBC939 and BXPC-3 cell proliferation in vitro,and the possible mechanism is acted by the axis of GH-IGF1.",

The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, mean time of stay in hospital and postoperative complications were studied.All operations in LG group were successfully preformed with laparoscopic technique, and the mean operation time was 105 min, mean intraoperative blood loss was 50 ml, and mean hospital stay was 7 days. Incisional wound infection occurred in 2 cases and no serious complications occurred in this group. In OG group, the mean operation time was 118 min, mean intraoperative blood loss was 108 ml, and mean hospital stay was 12 days. Wound infection occurred in 7 cases, disorder of gastric emptying was found in 3 cases, fistula of anastomotic stoma happened in 1 case and bowel obstruction occurred in 1 case. There was significant difference in operation blood loss and hospital stay between the two groups (P < 0.05).Laparoscopic gastric resection is a safe and feasible minimally-invasive surgery, it brings less pain, less bleeding, shorter hospital stay.",

        "abstract": "Objective To study the feasibility and clinical application of laparoscopic surgery for choledocholithiasis. Methods 510 patients with choledocholithiasis were undergone laparoscopic common bile duct exploration. For those cases dignosed preoperatively, common bile duct was incised and the calculi were taken out with fibrocholedochoscope. Some patients had suffered from obstructive jaundice, pancreatitis, bilirubinemia, alkaline phosphatase (AKP) raise, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase (\u03b3-GGT) raise and/or diameter of common bile duct exceeded 0.8 cm; and for these cases intraoperative cholangiography must be carried out. 405 cases needed T-tube insertion. The common bile duct of 105 cases was sutured without T tube. Results All cases were operated successfully. Total operative time was lightly longer (but no statistic difference) than that in the laparoscopy surgery group, with shorter hospital stay. No statistic difference was found between the two groups about bile leak, bleeding, and retained stones as well. 30 cases felt pain after operation because of the drainage tube stab. Bile did not drain off from T-tube in 2 cases until 2 days after operation. 24 cases with residual calculus were cured by fibrocholedochoscope 3 months after operation. The span of operation time of T-tube group was(110\u00b115) min and mean time of postoperative hospital stay was 8 days. In \u2160stage suture group the span of operation time was (95\u00b18) min and postoperative hospital stay was 5 days. Conclusion The laparoscopic surgery is a safe and effective method for choledocholithiasis, it has advantages of minimal injury and rapidly recovery and it can shorten hospital stay, especially in the \u2160stage suture group.",

        "abstract": "Objective To discuss the efficacy and cosmetic effect of laparoscopic thyroidectomy for patients with thyroid diseases. Methods The clinical data of 160 patients who underwent laparoscopic thyroidectomy through the anterior chest approach were analyzed. The operation was performed under a pressure of 8 mm Hg within the surgical space at the neck. After the thyroid was separated completely, the lesions were resected using an ultrasound knife. Results Laparoscopic thyroidectomy was completed in 157 of the patients including 6 cases of papillary adenocarcinoma. The other 3 patients were converted to open surgery because of hyperthyroidisms complicated with intraoperative hemorrhage (1) or thyroid carcinoma complicated with lymph node metastasis (2). No severe complications involving the trachea and parathyroid occurred in this series. One patient with thyroid carcinoma developed transient hoarseness after the operation; one patient with nodular goiter had postoperative subcutaneous hemorrhage and hydrops; both of them were cured spontaneously. Postoperative hospital stay ranged from 3 to 5 days (mean, 4 days). The patients were followed up for 3 to 24 months with a mean of 6.8 months, during which none of them had recurrence. All the patients were satisfied with cosmetic outcomes of the surgery. Conclusion Laparoscopic thyroidectomy via the anterior chest approach is safe and feasible for patients with thyroid diseases with good cosmetic results.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To explore the in vitro effect of human growth hormone (GH) on the proliferation of pancreatic carcinoma cell line (BXPC-3 cells) as well as the possible mechanism. METHODS: BXPC-3 cells during exponential growth stage were harvested and divided into experimental group and control group. The ex- perimental group was separated into four sub- groups according to the doses of GH (50, 100 \u03bcg/L) and culture time (2, 24 h). Insulin-like growth factors 1, 2 (IGF-1, IGF-2) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELI- SA). BXPC-3 cells cultured for 24 h with vari- ous GH concentrations were made into singlecell suspensions and the samples underwent subsequent cell cycle evaluation. IGF-1 receptor mRNA and IGF-2 receptor mRNA were tested with in situ hybridization. RESULTS: The GH-stimulated cell growth in vitro and the cell proliferation index (PI) were significantly increased after 24-h culture (cell number: 8.44 \u00b1 1.25, 7.50 \u00b1 0.64 vs 5.26 \u00b1 0.65, P < 0.05; PI: 0.60 \u00b1 0.06, 0.57 \u00b1 0.04 vs 0.50 \u00b1 0.04, P < 0.05), while the number of S-phase cells was also markedly increased (47.62% \u00b1 6.74%, 54.60% \u00b1 7.59% vs 38.37% \u00b1 4.99%, P < 0.05). The quantity of IGF-1 was significantly increased after 2-h cul- ture in the experimental group, but there was no statistical significance between the two groups after 24-h culture. The IGF-1 receptor mRNA and the IGF-2 receptor mRNA were positively expressed in BXPC-3 cells. Furthermore, the ex- pression of IGF-1 receptor mRNA was increased after GH induction, but the expression of IGF-2 receptor mRNA was not. CONCLUSION: GH can stimulate the prolifera- tion of pancreatic carcinoma cells in vitro and the possible mechanism may be related to the axis of GH-IGF-1.",

The maximum current of the superconducting transformer is 50 kA. The conductor samples could be tested at different magnetic fields and cooling conditions similar to the operational condition of ITER. During normal operation, the primary and secondary windings of the superconducting transformer will withstand the high electromagnetic (EM) stress caused by the high current. Integrated analysis of EM and structural fields can ensure these components not to encounter any over-stress problem under normal operational condition. A coupled model is proposed to combine the EM and structural analyses. A detailed finite element (FE) model and EM-structural coupled model are presented and the numerical results show that the stress of the transformer windings is within the allowable limits.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the cryogenic system of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) Correction Coils (CC) test facility, which consists of a 500 W/4.5 K helium refrigerator, a 50 kA superconducting transformer cryostat (STC) and a background field magnet cryostat (BFMC). The 500 W/4.5 K helium refrigerator synchronously produces both the liquid helium (LHe) and supercritical helium (SHe). The background field magnet and the primary coil of the superconducting transformer (PCST) are cooled down by immersing into 4.2 K LHe. The secondary Cable-In-Conduit Conductor (CICC) coil of the superconducting transformer (SCST), superconducting joints and the testing sample of ITER CC are cooled down by forced-flow supercritical helium. During the commissioning experiment, all the superconducting coils were successfully translated into superconducting state. The background field magnet was fully cooled by immersing it into 4.2 K LHe and generated a maximal background magnetic field of 6.96 T; the temperature of transformer coils and current leads was reduced to 4.3 K; the inlet temperature of SHe loop was 5.6 K, which can meet the cooling requirements of CIC-Conductor and joint boxes. It is noted that a novel heat cut-off device for High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) binary current leads was introduced to reduce the heat losses of transformer cryostat. Keywords Cryogenic system Superconducting conductor Cryostat Helium refrigerator Supercritical helium 1 Introduction International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is an experimental tokamak (magnetic confinement fusion) research project which aims to demonstrate that it is possible to produce commercial energy from fusion to meet the humankind\u2019s future energy requirement [1] . ITER project is one of the largest international-cooperation scientific experiments in the world, which is proceeding in the engineering construction phase. ITER CC (Correction Coils), one types of superconducting coils of ITER device, are used to compensate field errors which arisen from misalignment of the coils and winding deviations from the nominal shape caused by fabrication tolerances, distortion tolerances and assembly tolerances. There are 18 multi-turn correction coils, consisting of six top CC, six bottom CC and six side CC. The ITER CC are made of Cable-In-Conduit Conductor (CICC), fabricated by multistage sub-cable of NbTi superconducting strand, and would be cooled by supercritical helium. According to its procurement arrangement, ITER CC conductor will be produced and subjected to dedicated test in China. Therefore, a large superconducting conductor test facility with large current (50 kA) and high magnetic field (7 T), known as ITER CC test facility, has been built recently in the Institute of Plasma Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ASIPP) [2] . The primary objective of the CC conductor sample test is to properly assess the critical performance of current and temperature ( I C , T CS ) of the tested conductors under the simulation operating conditions and to confirm whether the tested conductor meets the ITER CC\u2019s performance requirements. ITER CC test facility mainly consists of cryogenic system, background magnet, current superconducting transformer, conductor short sample cryostat, power supply system, vacuum pumping system, control and data acquisition system and instrumentations [3] (see Fig. 1 ). The peak field provided by background magnet could reach to 6.96 T at 4.2 K. The current superconducting transformer could supply 50 kA current for the test facility [4] . This paper is concerned with design and construction of the cryogenic system of ITER CC test facility. As an important part of this test facility, the helium cryogenic system must be able to provide adequate flow rate, pressure, and refrigeration capacity to cool down and maintain all the magnets and conductors in superconducting state under normal operating conditions. This paper firstly presents the overall structure of the cryogenic system and the design of the cooling loop based on the required cooling temperature, helium pressure and mass flow rates of different superconducting magnets. As a main work, the detailed structural design of the superconducting transformer cryostat is described. It is noted that in order to reduce the heat losses of transformer cryostat, a novel heat cut-off device for HTS binary current leads was introduced in this paper. Finally, the commissioning experiment results are achieved and analyzed. 2 The design of cryogenic system The cryogenic system of ITER CC test facility mainly consists of a 500 W/4.5 K helium refrigerator, a 50 kA current superconducting transformer cryostat (STC) and a 7 T background field magnet cryostat (BFMC) (see Fig. 2 ). The 500 W/4.5 K helium refrigerator is connected with the STC and BFMC by transmission pipelines. It is mainly used for producing 4.2 K liquid helium (LHe) to immerse and cool down the background field magnet and the primary coil of the superconducting transformer (PCST). In addition, it can also supply the forced-flow supercritical helium (SHe) of 4.5 K/3.5 bar to cool down the secondary coil of superconducting transformer (SCST) and the ITER CC conductor sample. The design parameters of the cryogenic system are presented in Table 1 . The distribution of LHe and SHe in the test facility is shown in Fig. 3 . 2.1 500 W/4.5 K helium refrigerator The 500 W/4.5 K helium refrigerator adopts Collins helium liquefaction cycle and possesses of four cooling stages as follows: liquid nitrogen pre-cooling, the first stage expansion (including three piston expanders), the second stage expansion (one piston expander) and J \u2013 T valve throttle cooling. The original nominal cooling capacity of this refrigerator was approximately equivalent to 500 W at 4.5 K, and it could provide 4.5\u20136 K, 2.5\u20135 bar, 20\u201340 g/s SHe for magnets or 150 L/h helium liquefying capability [5] . However, as this refrigerator has been in service for 30 years, the cooling capacity has been seriously degenerated. Particularly the efficiency reduction of piston expanders caused that the outlet temperature of refrigerator is too high. It was about 5.3 K @ 3.0 bar during last commissioning experiment. In fact, we are planning to build a new helium refrigerator with 1000 W @ 4.2 K capacity to cope with this problem. The existing 500 W/4.5 K cryogenic system shares the same compressors unit with EAST Tokamak cryogenic system, to which seven sets of oil injection type screw compressors are applied. 2.2 Background field magnet cryostat The background field magnet cryostat (BFMC) was originally used to serve the CEA test facility for testing TORUS II conductors and then presented to ASIPP in 2003. We have rebuilt this device after many improvements were done in the cooling, power supply, data measurement and acquisition, magnet quench protection system, etc. [6] . The scheme of BFMC is shown in Fig. 4 . This cryostat features a DC background field up to 7 T in a 338 mm useful bore diameter [7,8] . When it is used for ITER CC short sample test, the sample anti-cryostat needs to be inserted into the 338 mm bore of the background magnet. 2.3 50 kA current superconducting transformer cryostat In the test facility, the 50 kA current is supplied by a current superconducting transformer which was immersed into a superconducting transformer cryostat (STC) by LHe. This transformer is comprised of two coaxial coils, named primary coil and secondary coil respectively. The primary coil was wound into solenoid coil by single NbTi superconducting strand and was placed in a cylindrical transformer LHe vessel [9] . The secondary coil, fixed to the outer surface of the transformer LHe vessel, was fabricated by CIC-Conductor for transmitting 50 kA large current. And it was cooled by 4.5 K/3.5 bar SHe. To maintain the superconductivity of the superconducting transformer, a cryostat was required. This cryostat was assembled at the top of BFMC by vertical flange coupling. From the bottom to the top, it mainly consists of two LHe vessels, High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) current leads, LN 2 vessel, heat cut-off device of current leads (HCDCL) and thermal shields (see Fig. 5 ). The superconducting transformer LHe vessel was used to immerse and cool down the primary coil into 4.2 K. The upper LHe storage vessel was applied to store helium and then supply LHe to the transformer LHe vessel. Therefore, the primary coil could be sufficiently cooled during operating period. Above the LHe storage vessel, there is a LN 2 vessel, which was used to cool the copper thermal shields and HCDCL. To decrease the evaporation of LHe, HTS current leads with 200 A nominal current, instead of common copper current leads, were used for charging the primary coil [9] . As a result, the heat loads was reduced to 0.13 W, much less than copper current leads\u2019. Under the operating conditions, the upper end of the HTS current leads were indirectly cooled by liquid nitrogen through the HCDCL and its temperature maintains at about 80 K. The lower end connected to the current terminal of the primary coil was immersed by 4.2 K LHe. The novel heat cut-off device of current leads (HCDCL) (see Fig. 6 ), cooled directly by liquid nitrogen, was applied to cut-off the heat flow of current leads. As shown in Fig. 6 , in the central part of LN 2 vessel, a copper heating conducting plate (CHCP) was installed and welded with the circular inner wall of LN 2 vessel. The circumference side of CHCP can directly contact with the LN 2 , so CHCP can be fully cooled by LN 2 . Thus the heat loads caused by common copper current leads will be cut-off by CHCP. In addition, between the CHCP and the copper current leads, there are some pieces of aluminium nitride (AlN) to play the role of electric insulation and heat transfer. Therefore the cooling capacity of LN 2 can be indirectly transferred to the copper current leads and the upper end of HTS current leads via the CHCP and AlN pieces. Meantime, the HCDCL can make full use of the cold capacity of helium gas, which evaporated from LHe vessel and can pass through the cut-off device by reserved channels. HCDCL can enhance the stability and security of HTS current leads. In addition, it also can reduce the heat loads caused by heat conducting of current leads, measurement wires and cryostat neck. The thermal shields are to ensure the temperature variation is within 5 K at the given heat loads. The external surface of the shields was covered with multi-layer super-insulation blanket. After calculation, the theoretical results of the heat loads and helium evaporation rate of the transformer cryostat are 5.84 W, 8.6 L/h respectively. 2.4 The closed circuit for short sample testing As shown in Fig. 2 , the transformer cryostat was connected with the sample test anti-cryostat by an interface flange for sealing. The lower end of the anti-cryostat where the ITER CC short sample is located was inserted into the bore of the background magnet. Two legs of the transformer secondary coil were extended to the anti-cryostat by crossing the interface flange and connected with the ITER CC short sample via CICC superconducting joints [9] . Therefore, the secondary coil, CC conductor short sample and superconducting joints comprised a closed current circuit (see Fig. 7 ). Based on this, the target of charging the ITER CC short sample with 50 kA large current induced from the secondary coil was achieved. Besides, there are cooling channels in the joints reserved for SHe cooling the CIC-Conductors of secondary coil and short sample as well as superconducting joints themselves. 3 Cooling procedure of the cryogenic system Before the liquid nitrogen was supplied to the LN 2 vessels and cooled the thermal shields of all cryostats, a vacuum pumping system had been initially used to bring all cryostats\u2019 pressure below 10 \u22123 Pa. Once the refrigerator was activated, the helium vessels of transformer cryostat and He baths of background magnet cryostat were pre-cooled by cold helium gaseous with forced circulation. To avoid extra thermal stress damage to magnets, when the temperature of magnets is higher than 100 K, the maximal temperature difference between output and input gas should not exceed 30 K. When the temperature is lower than 10 K, another refrigerator operation mode should be switched to, in which the 4.2 K LHe was produced and then supplied to the helium vessels and He baths. After these vessels were filled with LHe, such a refrigerator operation mode should be adopted, in which the 4.5 K/3.5 bar SHe was produced and the valves of SHe cooling loops were turned on and then SHe entered into and cooled down the CIC-Conductors of secondary coil and ITER CC short sample as well as superconducting joints. While the LHe of the helium vessels and He baths is not sufficient, it can be supplemented through the flow control valves throttling SHe into LHe. That is to say this cryogenic system can supply LHe and SHe simultaneously by self-designed valves external throttling. Fig. 8 shows the flow chart of cryogenic system. The helium coolant was divided into two streams before injected into test facility, i.e. 4.5 K/3.5 bar SHe and 4.2 K LHe. 1. 4.5 K/3.5 bar SHe : just as \u2460 \u2013 \u2460 loop shows in Fig. 8 , supplying the forced-flow SHe to cool down the secondary coil of transformer, the ITER CC test sample and CICC joint boxes. 2. 4.2 K LHe : just as \u2461 \u2013 \u2461 loop and \u2462 \u2013 \u2462 loop shows in Fig. 8 , taking advantage of the throttle function of self-designed low-temperature valve, one can attain 4.2 K LHe and use it to immerse the background magnet and the primary coil of superconducting transformer. 4 Experiments and discussion The cryogenic commissioning experiment for the ITER CC test facility has been conducted. Fig. 9 shows the cooling down curve of ITER CC test facility. Based on the experiment, a number of important results were obtained and a few conclusions were reached as well: (1) The background magnet was fully cooled by LHe immersion and generated a maximal magnetic field of 6.96 T under the maximal charging current of 1000 A. (2) The temperature of superconducting transformer magnets and current leads was reduced to 4.3 K and the inlet temperature of supercritical helium was 5.6 K. Although the 5.6 K SHe can cool down the CIC-Conductors and joint boxes and maintain their superconductivity, it is too high for real tests of ITER CC. After carefully reviewing the experimental data, it was found that two main reasons contributed to the higher temperature of SHe. Firstly, as this refrigerator has been in service for 30 years, the efficiency reduction of piston expanders resulted in higher outlet temperature of refrigerator. On the other hand, the design of existing transfer lines was unreasonable, thus lead to large heat leakage. The existing transfer lines were common evacuated transfer lines. The heat leakage of this kind of transfer lines is about 1.5 W/m. Therefore, for 40 m transfer lines, the heat loss is about 60 W. In order to cope with these two issues, we are planning to build a new 1000 W @ 4.2 K refrigerator and design a new type of transfer line which can make full use of the cold capacity of helium return gas, so the heat leakage will be reduced greatly. When the above two issues are effectively resolved, it is expected to achieve the goal that the inlet temperature of SHe is below 4.5 K. (3) The temperature of HTS upper end and heat cut-off device stayed at 80 K. It can be concluded that the heat cut-off device played a significant role in cutting heat flow and reducing heat loads. (4) The real helium evaporation rate of the transformer cryostat is 9.5 L/h, a bit higher than the calculated value (8.6 L/h). The nitrogen evaporation rate of the transformer cryostat is 2.5 L/h, higher than the designed value (2.1 L/h). (5) The goal is achieved that the helium refrigerator synchronously provides LHe and SHe by throttling SHe into LHe. (6) During the cryogenic commissioning experiment, the current in the primary coil of transformer was charged from 0 to 150 A, increasing at the rate of 80 A/min. The current induced in the secondary coil loop increased from 0 to 58 kA, higher than the designed value (50 kA). 5 Conclusions The cryogenic system of ITER CC test facility was manufactured and tested in ASIPP. The helium refrigerator successfully achieved the goal of synchronously providing LHe and SHe for different superconducting coils and magnets. The structure of the overall cryogenic system is proper and effective. The background magnet generated a maximal magnetic field of 6.96 T under the maximal charging current of 1000 A. As for the transformer cryostat, the temperature of transformer magnets and current leads was reduced to 4.3 K and the inlet temperature of SHe was 5.6 K, which met the cooling requirements of CIC-Conductors and joint boxes. The heat cut-off device of the transformer cryostat stayed at 80 K during the operation period and played a significant role in cutting heat flow and reducing heat loads. The real helium evaporation rate of the transformer cryostat is 9.5 L/h, a bit higher than the calculated value of 8.6 L/h. All the experiment results prove that the design of the cryogenic system is successful and suitable for the ITER CC test facility. The results in accordance with the design will take a milestone step on the way to the ITER CC project. After a series of successful commissioning and pre-tests, a thorough acceptance test program will be conducted. It is expected that the acceptance test will be passed and the ITER CC test facility will be ready for real tests as soon as possible.

A new I measurement system that can carry out accurate I measurement for HTS short samples with various temperatures (4.2-80 K), magnetic fields (0-14 T), and angles of the magnetic field (0\u00b0-90\u00b0) has been developed. The I measurement system mainly consists of a measurement holder, temperature-control system, background magnet, test cryostat, data acquisition system, and DC power supply. The accuracy of temperature control is better than \u00b10.1 K over the 20-80 K range and \u00b10.05 K when measured below 20 K. The maximum current is over 1000 A with a measurement uncertainty of 1%. The system had been successfully used for YBaCuO(YBCO) tapes I determination with different temperatures and magnetic fields.",

        "abstract": "The China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR) is a new tokamak device whose magnet system includes toroidal field, central solenoid (CS) and poloidal field coils. The main goal is to build a fusion engineering tokamak reactor with about 1 GW fusion power and self-sufficiency by blanket. In order to reach this high performance, the magnet field target is 15 T. However, the huge electromagnetic load caused by high field and current is a threat for conductor degradation under cycling. The conductor with a short-twist-pitch (STP) design has large stiffness, which enables a significant performance improvement in view of load and thermal cycling. But the conductor with STP design has a remarkable disadvantage: it can easily cause severe strand indentation during cabling. The indentation can reduce the strand performance, especially under high load cycling. In order to overcome this disadvantage, a new design is proposed. The main characteristic of this new design is an updated layout in the triplet. The triplet is made of two Nb3Sn strands and one soft copper strand. The twist pitch of the two Nb3Sn strands is large and cabled first. The copper strand is then wound around the two superconducting strands (CWS) with a shorter twist pitch. The following cable stages layout and twist pitches are similar to the ITER CS conductor with STP design. One short conductor sample with a similar scale to the ITER CS was manufactured and tested with the Twente Cable Press to investigate the mechanical properties, AC loss and internal inspection by destructive examination. The results are compared to the STP conductor (ITER CS and CFETR CSMC) tests. The results show that the new conductor design has similar stiffness, but much lower strand indentation than the STP design. The new design shows potential for application in future fusion reactors.",

This may require a maximum magnetic field of the central solenoid and toroidal field coils up to 15 T. New magnet technologies should be developed for the next generation of fusion reactors with higher requirements. Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox (Bi2212) is considered as a potential and promising superconductor for the magnets in the CFETR. Ru0026D activities are ongoing at the Institute of Plasma Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences for demonstration of the feasibility of a CICC based on Bi2212 round wire. One sub-size conductor cabled with 42 wires was designed, manufactured and tested with limited strand indentation during cabling and good transport performance. In this paper, the first test results and analysis on the AC loss of Bi2212 round wires and cabled conductor samples are presented. Furthermore, the impact of mechanical load on the AC loss of the sub-size conductor is investigated to represent the operation conditions with electromagnetic loads. The first tests provide an essential basis for the validation of Bi2212 CICC and its application in fusion magnets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The magnet system of China fusion engineering test reactor (CFETR) includes toroidal field, central solenoid (CS) and poloidal field coils. The design and fabrication of CS coil are most significant and challenging for China due to the lack of experience. As the core technique of CS coil, cable-in-conduit-conductor (CICC) has been chosen to ITER CS conductor with the short twist pitch (STP) cable pattern. STP cable pattern has been demonstrated to avoid the performance degradation of conductor after electromagnetic cycling and warm-up-cool-down thermal cycles during operation. For qualifying the manufacturing process and performance of conductor, two short sample conductors were manufactured at ASIPP and tested at Swiss Plasma Center. Performance tests include DC test,  T cs  , AC loss and  MQE  (Minimum Quench Energy) measurements. This paper is mainly about the stability analysis, and the energy margins of the conductor at various operation conditions are investigated with test data and model simulation.",

The short twist pitch design recommended by CEA is chosen for the CSMC Nb 3 Sn cable-in-conduit conductors. In order to better understand the evolution of transport properties and coupling losses related to the effect of electromagnetic load cycles, the mechanical and electrical properties were measured and investigated employing a special cryogenic press facility for the transverse mechanical loadings. The results show that the transverse compression ( d y  ) versus applied load force ( F y   ) is different from first to subsequent loading cycles. This mechanical behavior can be interpreted by the combination of strands bending between the crossovers and strands deformation at the crossovers. The fitting relations of  d y   versus  F y   are also presented. The evolution of interstrand contact resistance ( R c  ) in the cabling stages with cyclic history and pressure effects are discussed. In addition, a fitting relation of  R c   versus  F y    is presented based on a combination of strandu0027s microsliding and copper matrix resistivity. A clear correlation between intrapetal resistance  R c   and coupling loss is also found.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The cable-in-conduit conductor (CICC) technology has been widely used in large scale superconducting magnet. The Short-Twist-Pitch (STP) design was aimed to avoid the conductor degradation during electromagnetic and thermal cycling. But manufacture of STP CICC deforms the cabled strands significantly. Indentations appear on superconducting strands after cabling and compaction. The conductor used for China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR) magnet will be subjected to much higher Lorentz force than ITER. The STP CICC will be the first choice for the conductor design, since it showed no observed current sharing temperature  T cs   degradation after electromagnetic cycling. In order to estimate the effects of indentation on the superconducting and mechanical properties of Nb 3 Sn strands, series measurements have been done on an internal-tin (IT) Nb 3 Sn strand, fabricated by Western Superconducting Technologies Co., Ltd (WST). The strand was artificially indented and cut to several sections for different kinds of measurements, which mainly included the critical current  I c   versus axial strain measurements with Pacman device and stress-strain tests. The results show that the indentation has less impact on  I c  , but more impact on mechanical performance. The sample preparation, test results and analysis have been described in details.",

Electrical joints are important aspect for CSMC, because the local heating from resistive losses can drive the superconductor into a less stable regime and result in premature quench. So part of the project is to develop joints with low DC resistance and AC loss. AC loss power and local heating of the full-size prototype conductor joint in the preliminary test scenario of CSMC are evaluated experimentally and numerically in this paper. The AC loss of the joint sample is measured in SULTAN facility with an applied harmonic field and wider frequency range. Based on the experimental results, the AC loss of the joint is characterized by Multizones Partial Shielding (MPAS) model. Then, the AC loss power of the joint is calculated in the test scenario. The temperature rise of joint is investigated numerically due to the simulated AC loss in the test scenario. The simulation results show the temperature rise in the joint is relatively higher which affects the stability greatly not only in joints, but also the coils. So the joint structure and test scenario of CSMC\u3000need to be optimized to reduce the AC loss and ensure safe operation. The way to reduce the AC loss deposit in the joint is also discussed.",

Firstly, the structure and operation parameters of CFETR CSMC are summarized including the superconductor, conductor and magnetic field distribution characteristic. Secondly, the main AC losses type and mechanics of CFETR CSMC are introduced, where the hysteresis and coupling loss of Nb 3 Sn and NbTi coil are estimated using of the model data and a calculation flux density distribution in the cross-section of model coil by ANSYS 2-D model. Thirdly, the low frequency eddy current loss calculation of stainless steel structural components is carried out by ANSYS/EMAG code with 3-D separately for tension rods, plates and beams model. The interaction between several components is not considered. In the case of conductor joints, a 3-D ANSYS code is also used with current force to obtain the eddy current losses for the metal components. Lastly, the individual loss components are summed up. The significant conclusions are made which can provide the valuable guidance for safe operation of CSMC.",

The Nb  3 Sn cable-in-conduit-conductor (CICC) is chosen for CFETR CSMC as the best conductor type because of 12 T field and 1.5 m inner diameter design requirement. The CFETR CSMC consists of two coaxial solenoid coils named Nb 3  Sn coil in the high field region and NbTi coil in the low field region to optimize the manufacture cost effectively. The maximum field of the Nb 3 Sn and NbTi coil can reach to 12 T and 6.1 T, respectively, when the operating current is 47.65 kA. In this paper, first, the basic design aim and operation requirements of CFETR CSMC are summarized. Second, the characteristics of Nb 3 Sn superconducting strands and CICCs are described in detailed. Subsequently, the basic structure design of CFETR CSMC is presented in the third part. The current sharing temperature and coupling loss measurement of Nb 3 Sn CICC sample, as the most important stage assessment, are performed in SUTLAN test facility and some meaningful conclusions are.",

For the multipancakes, the radial dimensions are from 1500 to 3544.8\u00a0mm and the maximum axial height is 1545.4\u00a0mm. High manufacture accuracy must be acquired for coil continuous winding, i.e., the innermost and outermost circular turn surface profile tolerance is 2\u00a0mm and the conductor feeding tolerance is 0.5\u2030L. The winding Ru0026D activities, including the continuous winding for the pancakes and the online forming for the joggles, have been conducted to optimize and finalize the coil design as well as to carry out the coil winding technology verification and improvement.

In the high temperature superconductors (HTS) magnets, REBCO tapes will be subjected to various kinds of strain/stress, the research in the effect of uniaxial strain effect on the performance of REBCO tapes is very necessary. The tensile and compressive axial strains dependence of critical current have been investigated at 77K in self-field with the U-spring devices of YBCO tapes, manufactured by Shanghai Superconducting Technologies Co. (SSTC) in China. Until the compressive strain to -8%, no degradation behavior of critical current could be seen, and the n-value of YBCO tapes hardly depended on compressive strain. The irreversible tensile strain limit was ~0.35%. Before reaching irreversible tensile strain limit, the degradation of I c  was slight and reversible. When the applied tensile strain exceeded 0.35%, the I c  and n-value reduced rapidly and was not recovered back anymore.",

        "abstract": "In order to study the effects of different tobacco planting patterns on soil microbial community, yield and quality of flue-cured tobacco, a field experiment including tobacco mono-cropping, green manure-tobacco with crop rotation, wheat inter-cropping and wheat-tobacco with crop-rotation was conducted in Gaoqiao Town, Yishui County, Shandong Province. The dynamics of soil microbial community in plowed layer (0-25cm) in 2009 was evaluated by using phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) profiles. The results showed that at green manure ploughing stage (April 22), the total PLFAs content was the lowest in wheat inter-cropping treatment. At resettling growth stage of tobacco (June 20), it was the highest in manure-tobacco with crop rotation treatment, which had significant differences with other treatments. But at budding stage and mature stage, there was no significant difference among all treatments. The PLFAs data of different soil microbial floras and the differences among treatments both varied from the sampling time, and no significant difference of fungi PLFAs was found in all treatments. The ratios of fungi to bacteria PLFAs and gram-positive bacteria to gram-negative bacteria PLFAs indicated that the total soil microbial community and bacteria community structure were both influenced by the planting pattern and growing season. Soil microbial community structure changed most obviously in the wheat-tobacco rotation treatment during the whole growing season. Moreover, principal component analyses (PCA) of different microbial PLFAs at maturity stage revealed that an obvious differentiation was found among the planting patterns, and soil microbial community structure changed little in wheat-tobacco rotation, but changed greatly in the manure-tobacco rotation treatment and wheat inter-cropping treatment compared with the tobacco mono-cropping treatment. Furthermore, the economic characters and chemical composition of flue-cured tobacco leaves were both affected by different tobacco planting patterns. The average price, output value and configuration structure of flue-cured tobacco leaf were all increased. The contents of total sugar and reducing sugar were both decreased, but the content of potassium of tobacco leaf increased significantly in the other three treatments compared with the tobacco mono-cropping treatment. The wheat inter-cropping treatment and wheat-tobacco rotation treatment were both considered as the better tobacco planting patterns according to their comprehensive benefits. These findings can help to understand the effects of tobacco cultivation on soil microbial environment, and provide a scientific basis for optimizing the tobacco planting pattern of northern China.",

        "abstract": "A field experiment was conduected to investigate the effects of nitrogen rates on dry matter accumulation, nitrogen uptake, yield and quality of the flue-cured tobacco in low fertility soil. The results showed that accumulation of dry matter and nitrogen, and nitrogen content in roots, stems, and leaves of the tobacco increased with increasing nitrogen rate. The soil inorganic nitrogen content increased and then decreased and kept stable finally. Appllying chemical nitrogen fertilizers could remarkably increase soil inorganic nitrogen content in short term. The yield, average price and output value of the tobacco increased and the chemical compositions bacame more balanced as the nitrogen rate increased if nitrogen rate was less than 105 kg/ha. In conclusion, nitrogen application can remarkably influence the biomass, nitrogen uptake and accumulation of the flue-cured tobacco.",

        "abstract": "In order to study the effect of different tobacco planting systems(green manure-tobacco with crop rotation,monoculture-tobacco,wheat-tobacco with crop-rotation and inter-cropping) on soil enzyme activities,soil samples were taken from brown soil in Yishui county,Shandong Province.Results showed that in the study period(from 24 Mar to 7 Sep in 2009),the soil catalase,sucrase and urase activity in plowed layers(0-25cm) were not significantly different under different planting systems.However,three soil enzyme activities varied with seasons differently.The activity of catalase changed with a small fluctuation in overall,but reached the minimum after 30 days of the flue-cured tobacco transplanting(20 Jun).Sucrase activity decreased after 30 days of the flue-cured tobacco transplanting,then it gradually increased,and reached the maximum at the harvest period(7 Sep.).Urase activity reached the maximum at squaring stage(68 days after the flue-cured tobacco transplanting) and then dramatically decreased.In terms of the different soil layers(0-5 cm,5-15 cm,15-25 cm),the catalase and urase activities increased with soil depth in the plowed layers,but the range was very small.The order of protease activity with soil depth was 5-15cm >0-5cm >15-25cm.In the whole growth period of flue-cured tobacco,the temporal variability of three soil enzymes was also analyzed.Soil urase had the largest temporal variation coefficient,which meant it had the largest effect by the outer environment in the whole tobacco growth period.Soil sucrase took the second place.Soil catalase had the smallest temporal variation coefficient,with a most stable seasonal variation.",

        "abstract": "In the development of current world trend of standardization on medical information,it is necessary to carry on the work of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) clinical terminology standardization.The framework of TCM clinical terminology classification standard is the basis for the standardization of Chinese medicine clinical terms.There is no precedent and specific guidance as reference in the field of traditional medicine both at home and abroad.We have researched foreign classification code standards such as the integration language system,SNOMED,ICD,and etc.Furthermore we have searched standardization works of TCM information.Through studying similarities and differences of characteristics of medical theoretical system and clinical diagnosis and treatment ideas in both TCM and modern medicine,and learning from construction pattern of SNOMED CT,we have explored the construction method of TCM clinical terminology classification standardization framework with unique TCM theory and subject characteristics.",

The hemorrhagic shock model was reproduced by heart puncture. The total RNA from lung tissue of mice in each group was extracted by Tripure reagent and the expression of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 mRNA were measured by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.Hemorrhagic shock and LPS challenge increased lung neutrophil infiltration and erythrocyte diapedesis. The expression of TLR2 mRNA and TLR4 mRNA could be found in normal lung tissues, but they were increased at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after hemorrhagic shock and LPS challenge. There was no change in the sham-operation group.The increased expression of TLR2 and TLR4 gene in lung tissue after hemorrhagic shock is closely correlated with the onset of acute lung injury. Though the innate immunity is enhanced, the animals are more susceptible to subsequent irritations. Over-expression of TLR2 and TLR4 may induce structural and functional damage to organs.",

Methods: In this multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial, patients with bacterial pneumonia or urinary tract infections were assigned randomly to receive biapenem or meropenem. Results: The overall clinical efficacy rates of biapenem and meropenem were 87.0% (107/123) and 90.1% (109/121) respectively. Specifically, the efficacy rates were 90.0% (63/70) vs. 91.9% (57/62) for bacterial pneumonia, and 83.0% (44/53) vs. 88.1% (52/59) for urinary tract infections, respectively. The overall bacterial eradication rates of biapenem and meropenem were 96.3% (77/80) and 98.8% (79/80) respectively, specifically 100% (42/42) vs. 100% (39/39) for bacterial pneumonia, and 92.1% (35/38) vs. 97.6% (40/41) for urinary tract infections. The incidence of adverse reaction was 4. 7% (6/129) in biapenem group and and 3.1% (4/128) in meropenem group. The incidence of drug-related laboratory abnormality was 17.1% (22/129) in biapenem group and 19.5% (25/128) in meropenem group. Discontinuation due to adverse reaction was reported in 2 (1.6 %) patients of biapenem group and 4 (3.1%) patients of meropenem group. No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of efficacy rate, bacterial eradication rate or incidence of adverse reaction. Conclusions: Biapenem is effective and well-tolerated in treating bacterial pneumonia and urinary tract infection, which is comparable to meropenem in terms of efficacy and safety.",

Methods U937 cells were cultured in vitro,and then phorbol myristate acetate(PMA) was added to induce U937 cells to phagocytosis. Functional U937 cells were infected with Mycobacterium intracellulare,Mycobacterium tuberculosis(MTB) and Mycobacterium abscessus.U937 cells in each group were extracted at 0 h,4 h,8 h,24 h,48 h,and 72 h time points.U937 cell apoptosis rate and the TLR2 in U937 cell membrane was detected with flow cytometry.TLR2 in U937 cells infected with Mycobacterium were detected with Western blot at 72 h time point.TLR2 of U937 cells were blocked by anti-TLR2 monoclonal antibody.We used different Mycobacterium affect the U937 cells.Then the apoptosis rate of U937 cells in which TLR2 were blocked was detected by flow cytometry.Results Following infection with M.intracellulare,M.abscessus,the apoptosis of U937 cells increased.The apoptosis rate was significantly higher than normal control,while no difference was found between MTB group and normal control.At 72 h time point,the apoptosis rate of U937 of M.abscessus group was the highest,followed by M.intracellulare group.MTB group was the lowest.After infection,the TLR2 increased in 4 hours,and then maintained such level after 8 hours.Each Mycobacterium induced different levels of TLR2.The TLR2 of MTB group was higher than M.intracellulare group,which was higher than M.abscessus group.Blocking TLR2 decreased the apoptosis rate of U937 cells significantly after infection by mycobacterium for 72 h.Conclusions Infection of Mycobacterium could induce the apoptosis of macrophage.TLR2 is not involved in the apoptosis of macrophage directly.However.TLR2 is associated with the Mycobacterium-induced apoptosis of macrophages.",

        "abstract": "Objective The present study presents a meta analysis on the correlation between the expression of ribonucleoside reductase regulatory factor 1(RRM1) and the therapeutic effects of gemcitabine for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods Chinese and English publications were retrieved from the CNKI, WANFANG, PubMed, EMBASE, and ASCO databases with an electronic computer to compare the response rate of the advanced NSCLC patients with different RRM1 expression level (high expression/positive and low expression/negative) to gemcitabine chemotherapy. The Cochrane Collaboration's RevMan 5.0 software was adopted for the analysis. Results Eleven studies, with a total of 515 patients, were identified. The number of patients with high/positive RRM1 protein expression was 235, and the overall efficacy rate was 17.9%. The number of patients with low/negative RRM1 protein expression was 280, and the overall efficacy rate was 44.3%. Heterogeneity test showed no statistical heterogeneity among studies (\u03c72=10.50, P=0.40, I2=5%). The fixed effect model was adopted for a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the studies, and it showed that the combined odds ratio (OR) was 3.70, with a 95% confidence interval of 2.43 to 5.63, Z=6.11, P<0.00001. Conclusion The patients with low/negative RRM1 expression in advanced NSCLC were more sensitive to gemcitabine chemotherapy compared with patients having high/positive RRM1 expression.",

        "abstract": "To observe the expressions of nerve growth factor (NGF) and its tyrosine kinase A (TrkA) receptor on alveolar macrophage in a rat model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Forty healthy male SD rats were randomly divided into a control group and a COPD group. The COPD model was established by exposing the rats to cigarette smoke for 6 months, and lung function changes were measured. Lung histopathological changes were detected by HE staining. The expression of NGF protein in the supernatant of alveolar macrophage (AM) culture medium was detected by ELISA. Confocal microscopy was used to identify the separation and purification of AM from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and to detect semi-quantitatively the expression of TrkA receptor on AM. NGF and its TrkA receptor at the mRNA level were evaluated by real-time PCR. The differences among groups were calculated by one way ANOVA, and comparison between groups was made by t test.Significant decrease of pulmonary compliance [(0.15 \u00b1 0.03) ml/cm H(2)O (1 cm H2O = 0.098 kPa)] and minute ventilation [(0.045 \u00b1 0.004) L], and significant increase of airway resistance [(0.038 \u00b1 0.004) cm H2O\u00d7L(-1)\u00d7s(-1)] were found in the COPD group compared with the control group [(0.42 \u00b1 0.05) ml/cm H2O and (0.102 \u00b1 0.010) L and (0.016 \u00b1 0.002) cm H2O\u00d7L(-1)\u00d7s(-1), t = 9.46 - 12.99, respectively, all P < 0.01]. Alveolar wall thinning, alveolar septa breakdown, alveolar enlargement and emphysema were significant in the COPD rats. The expression of NGF protein in the supernatant of AM culture medium was enhanced in the COPD group [(3.79 \u00b1 1.52) ng/L] compared with the controls [(0.94 \u00b1 0.27) ng/L, t = 4.13, P < 0.05]. Mean fluorescence intensity of TrkA protein on AM in the COPD group (19.5 \u00b1 1.5) was higher than that in the control group (11.2 \u00b1 1.9, t = 7.95, P < 0.05). The expressions of NGF and TrkA at mRNA level in the COPD group (24.8 \u00b1 6.0 and 9.0 \u00b1 3.3) were increased compared with the control group (1.0 \u00b1 0.2 and 1.0 \u00b1 0.4, t = 8.48 and 5.16, all P < 0.05).The expressions of NGF and its TrkA receptor on AM in COPD group were increased, indicating that NGF and its TrkA receptor might be involved in the pathogenesis of COPD mediated by AM.",

        "abstract": "Objective Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths.Angiogenesis in the cancerous tissue is closely related to the severity,metastasis and prognosis of tumors.This study aimed to study the role of miR-21 in human lung cancer angiogenesis and its possible mechanism using different angiogenesis models.Methods The scratch test of HUVEC proliferation was done by treating HUVECs with cell culture supernatants from human lung cancer cells with different expressions of miR-21.The VEGF level in the cell culture supernatant was analyzed by Luminex technology.The expressions of CD31,VEGFR2 and phosphorylated VEGFR2-Tyr951 was determined by immunohistochemistry.Results The A549 cells with a high expression of miR-21 showed an obviously decreased scratch diameter as compared with those with a low miR-21 expression,indicating a stronger scratch repair capability of the former.Pemetrexed showed an inhibitory effect on A549 cells with different levels of miR-21 expression.The VEGF concentration was higher in the A549 cells with a high miR-21 expression than in those with a low one.Pemetrexed inhibited VEGF secretion from the A549 cells highly expressing miR-21.The expression level of vascular endothelial cell marker CD31 was significantly higher in the A549 cells with a high miR-21 expression than in those with a low one(P<0.01),but there were no significant differences in the VEGFR2 expression between the two groups.VEGFR2 phosphorylation in Tyr951 was significantly higher in the former than in the latter(P<0.01).Conclusion miR-21 may play an important role in human lung cancer angiogenesis by regulating VEGF expression and VEGFR2 phosphorylation,and pemetrexed has an inhibitory effect on lung cancer angiogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Objective. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous noncoding RNAs that spatiotemporally modulate mRNAs in a posttranscriptional manner. Engineering mutant viruses by inserting cell-specific miRNA recognition element (MRE) into viral genome may alter viral infectivity and host responses in vital tissues and organs infected with pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1) 2009 (H1N1pdm). Methods. In this study, we employed reverse genetics approach to generate a recombinant H1N1pdm with a cell-specific miRNA target sequence inserted into its PB1 genomic segment to investigate whether miRNAs are able to suppress H1N1pdm replication. We inserted an MRE of microRNA-let-7b (miR-let-7b) into the open reading frame of PB1 to test the feasibility of creating a cell-restricted H1N1pdm virus since let-7b is abundant in human bronchial epithelial cells. Results. miR-let-7b is rich in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE). Incorporation of the miR-let-7b-MRE confers upon the recombinant H1N1pdm virus susceptibility to miR-let-7b targeting, suggesting that the H1N1pdm and influenza A viruses can be engineered to exert the desired replication restrictive effect and decrease infectivity in vital tissues and organs. Conclusions. This approach provides an additional layer of biosafety and thus has great potential for the application in the rational development of safer and more effective influenza viral vaccines.",

The serum samples of all patients and 6 patients with IA after 7 day treatment were used for GM detection. A double-direct sandwich ELISA was employed to detect GM optical density index (ODI) in the serum samples. Measurement data followed the Gaussian distribution were expressed as x +/- s. Differences among groups were tested using a one factor analysis of variance. The significance of variation before and after therapy was tested with paired t test. P < 0.05 were considered to represent a significant difference. Statistical analyses were performed by SPSS statistical package.The serum GM ODI in IA patients was higher (1.63 +/- 0.29) than that in other IFI patients (0.96 +/- 0.49) and Aspergillus colonization patients (0.83 +/- 0.43) , F = 12.681, P < 0.05. The serum GM ODI of 6 patients with IA before and after treatment were 1.67 +/- 0.24 and 1.62 +/- 0.28 (t = 0.475, P > 0.05), respectively. If the cutoff GM ODI was 1.5, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for diagnosis of IA in the patients were 72.7% , 84.2%, 57.1% and 94.1%, respectively.The serum GM detection has diagnostic value for IA and could distinguish Aspergillus infection from other invasive fungal infections and Aspergillus colonization.

All of them had been immunocompetent before drowning. Two patients drowned because of traffic accident, and 1 fell in sewage by accident. All of the 3 patients were intubated because of acute respiratory failure, and received broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. One had transient leucopenia, and 2 patients received glucocorticoid therapy. The condition of the 3 cases deteriorated 9 to 11 days after near-drowning. Aspergillus was isolated from sputum samples of 2 patients at the same time. Thoracic CT findings included multiple nodules, consolidation and cavity formation. Multiple abscesses in cerebral parenchyma were found in 1 patient with invasive cerebral aspergillosis. One patient died, whose lungs, cerebral parenchyma, myocardium and kidney were all infected by aspergillus. The other 2 patients, whose infection limited to the lungs, had a positive prognosis. Using the terms \"aspergillosis\" and \"near-drowning\" a PUBMED search yielded 7 articles, published between 1984 and 2010. Using the terms \"invasive pulmonary aspergillosis\" and \"near-drowning\", searching Wangfang data and CHED data, encompass 1 article, published in 2009. In all of the 8 articles, there are 5 final diagnosis cases and 3 clinical diagnosis cases.IA was very rare in immunocompetent hosts but had been reported in previously healthy individuals after near-drowning. Aspergillosis might develop 1 to 2 weeks after near-drowning, and the prognosis was poor in patients with central nervous system involvement.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the expression level of hepatocyte growth factor( HGF) of serum and anoxia degree in patients with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease( overlap syndrome,OS). Methods A total of 78 consecutive patients with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome( 46 with COPD,32 without COPD) and 30 health volunteer were enrolled in the study. Serum concentrations of HGF were measured with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay( ELISA),and the relationships between the serum HGF level and apnea hypopnea index( AHI),lowest SatO2( LSatO2) were analyzed by linear correlation analysis. Results The serum HGF concentration was 685. 46 \u00b1 57. 34( pg / mL) in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and 884. 65 \u00b1 58. 32( pg / mL) in OS,and464. 26 \u00b1 50. 31( pg / mL) in the controls,which was significantly higher in the OSAHS patients than the controls,and highest in the OSAHS patients with COPD( P < 0. 05). The serum HGF concentrations was positively related to AHI( r = 0. 431,P < 0. 05) and negatively related to LSatO2( r =-0. 289,P <0. 05) in the patients with OSAHS only,positively related to AHI,( r =0. 618,P <0. 01)and negatively related to LSatO2( r =-0. 573,P <0. 01) in the OSAHS patients with COPD. Conclusion Serum HGF concentration increases significantly in patients with OSAHS especially in OS,and positively correlates with the severity of OSAHS and COPD.",

Randomized controlled trials of patients with severe, stable COPD and receiving noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, compared with sham ventilation or no ventilation, were reviewed. The mortality, physiological and health related parameters were pooled to yield odds ratio (OR), weighted mean differences or standardized mean differences (SMD), with 95% confidence interval (CI).Eight parallel and three crossover randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Pooled analysis for parallel, randomized controlled trials showed noninvasive positive pressure ventilation: (1) Did not affect the 12- or 24-month mortality (OR 0.82, 95%CI: 0.48 to 1.41); (2) Improved the arterial carbon dioxide tension (SMD -0.88, 95%CI: -1.43 to -0.34); (3) Did not improve forced expiratory volume in one second (SMD 0.20, 95%CI: -0.06 to 0.46), maximal inspiratory pressure (SMD 0.01, 95%CI: -0.28 to 0.29) or 6-minute walk distance (SMD 0.17, 95%CI: -0.16 to 0.50); (4) Subgroup analysis showed noninvasive positive pressure ventilation improved the arterial carbon dioxide tension in hypercapnic patients. Pooled analysis for crossover randomized controlled trials did not show improvement in arterial blood gas or forced expiratory volume in one second with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation.Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation improves the arterial carbon dioxide tension but does not improve the mortality, pulmonary function, or exercise tolerance and should be cautiously used in severe stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To establish the mouse model of Chlamydia pneumoniae infection and investigate the altered expression of TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA after C. pneumoniae infection. Methods: Sixty male Icr mice were randomly divided into control or experiment group. The animals in control group were inoculated with sucrose phosphate buffer, whereas the animals in experiment group were challenged with intranasal C. pneumoniae. Mice in the two groups were killed and lung tissue was sampled on scheduled time points: Day 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 separately. The changes of expression of TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA in lung tissues of mice were measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Results: The alteration of TLR expression in the lung tissues of mice was apparent after C. pneumoniae infection. The levels of TLR2 mRNA expression on Day 3, 5, 7 and 14 (0. 849 \u00b1 0. 107, 0. 981 \u00b10. 104, 0. 926 \u00b1 0. 116, 0. 905 \u00b1 0. 046) were significantly higher than that of the control group (0. 375 \u00b1 0. 149, 0. 340 \u00b1 0. 069, 0. 314 \u00b1 0. 074, 0. 302 \u00b1 0. 010, P<0. 01). The largest difference was observed on Day 5. All the levels of TLR4 mRNA expression in the treatment group on Day 1, 3, 5, 7 and 14 (0. 377 \u00b1 0. 033, 0. 481 \u00b1 0. 101, 0. 361 \u00b1 0. 034, 0. 326 \u00b1 0. 056, 0. 297 \u00b1 0. 040) were lower in value compared with that of the control group (0. 702 \u00b1 0. 156, 0. 547 \u00b1 0. 106, 0. 626 \u00b1 0. 128, 0. 425 \u00b1 0. 008, 0. 477 \u00b1 0. 043), but there was no statistically significant difference. Conclusions: The alteration of TLR gene in lungs of mice is closely correlated with C. pneumoniae infection, mainly the change of TLR2 gene expression. The change of TLR gene in lungs might reinforce the non-specific immune response. The expression of TLR2 mRNA may be upregulated or down-regulated as C. pneumoniae infection worsens or improves.",

Methods:Twelve patients with chronic stable asthma ,10 stable chronic bronchitis and 7 healthy controls were included.All subjects underwent pulmonary function test,and the HRCT scans were performed at three selected levels :superior margin of the aortic arch ,tracheal carina, and 2 \ue5f4cm above the rightdiaphragm within a 2 day period.The thickness of section cuts was 2 \ue5f4mm.During the scan,the patient held his/her breath at the end of full inspiratory. The 50\ue5f4mm 2 region of interest (ROI) 5\ue5f4mm below pleura was chosen in the front, middle ,and rear within all CT scan cuts respectively, and the value of the CT Lung density in these areas was measured .In five of the asthmatic patients CT scans and pulmonary function tests were performed before and after treatment with Salbutamo. In a different group of four asthmatics these measurements were performed at the end of and 6 weeks after an exacerbation. Results:The mean value of the CT Lung density in the patients with asthma was higher than that in the patients with chronic bronchitis(-904 HU and -943 HU, P<0.05). Both the mean value of the CT Lung density in the patients with asthma and chronic bronchitis were lower than that in normal controls(mean -778 HU,-760 HU~-796 HU, P<0.05)\u3002There was a considerable overlap in the CT lung density between patients with asthma and chronic bronchitis. The pulmonary function after using sabutamol was improved and the value of the CT lung density did not change in five asthmatics (P> 0.05). In a different group of four asthmatics the pulmonary function was improved and the value of the CT lung density did not change at the end of and 6 weeks after an exacerbation (P>0.05). Conclusion:Some patients with chronic asthma develop a reduction in computed tomography lung density which is not affected by air trapping ,similar to that in patients with chronic bronchitis, which morphologically reflect the airway remodeling in patients with asthma indirectly.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of docetaxel-based regimen in the treatment of advanced upper digestive tract carcinoma. METHODS:Thirty-one patients were treated with TF regimen or TP regimen. They were also previously treated, docetaxel was given with weekly procedure, docetaxel 30 mg/m2 i.v. on d_1,d_8,d_ 15 , 5-Flurouracil 500 mg/m2, i.v, d_1-d_5 or DDP 20 mg/d, i.v, d_1-d_5. The cycles repeated for every 28 days. All the patients received over two cycles of chemotherapy. RESULTS:All patients were evaluable for response and toxicity. There were 8 patients with PR and 13 patients with SD. The overall response rate and the disease control rate were 25.8%(8/31) and 67.7%(21/31) respectively. The median time of tumor progression was 4.9 months. The major toxicities were bone suppression and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Docetaxel combinated with other chemotherapeutic agents are effective in the treatment of advanced upper digest tract carcinoma patients who are treated previously, and the toxicity is tolerable. It is worth observing further in the future.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To investigate the Levels of elastase and \u03b1_1-antitrypsin in induced sputum in patients with moderate-severe asthma and the relationship to the number of inflammation cells,interleukin-8(IL-8) and FEV1 values(%predicted).Method:12 patients with moderate-severe asthma during chronic persistence,12 patients with stable moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD) and 10 normal control subjects were included in this study. Lung function was measured. Induced sputum was obtained and processed for cell differential and the supernatant was assayed for the concentrations of IL-8 and elastase by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The activity of \u03b1_1-antitrypsin was also measured by Dietz method.Result:The levels of elastase and \u03b1_1-antitrypsin in induced sputum in patients with asthma(respectively,108.79\u00b126.54 ng/mL, 8.9\u00b12.5\u00d710~ -2 u/mL) and COPD (respectively,153.84\u00b133.37 ng/mL ,11.9\u00b13.1\u00d710~ -2 u/mL )were significantly higher than those in normal control subjects (respectively,25.36\u00b15.62 ng/mL ,0.8\u00b10.6\u00d710~ -2 u/ml ,F=3.52,3.24,all P<0.05)).Both of the levels of elastase in induced sputum in patients with asthma and COPD correlated positively with the percentage of neutrophil(respectively, r=0.58\u3001r=0.63,P<0.05)and the level of IL-8(respectively, r=0.60,r=0.65,P<0.05),but correlated inversely with FEV1%( respectively, r=-0.55\u3001r=-0.71,P<0.05). The ratio between elastase and \u03b1_1-antitrypsin in induced sputum in patients with asthma and COPD(respectively, 12.9\u00b18.5,13.54\u00b17.5) were significantly lower than that in normal control subjects(32.8\u00b18.6, F=3.14,P<0.05),and correlated positively with FEV1% (respectively, r=0.63,r=0.52,P<0.05).Conclusion:There is an imbalance between elastase and \u03b1_1-antitrypsin in induced sputum in patients with moderate-severe asthma.Increased levels of elastase in induced sputum in patients with severe middle-severe asthma are associated with airway inflammation and airflow limitation, which is similar with COPD and may play a role in the pathogenesis of airway remodeling. IL-8 participate in the process of the airway inflamation and airflow limitation in patients with moderate-severe asthma.",

METHODS: The experiment was conducted in the laboratory of respiratory diseases, General Hospital of Nanjing Military Command of Chinese PLA between October 2005 and March 2006. \u2460Ten healthy adult Wistar rats were selected either male or female. pCMV-rGR were used to transfer the in vitro cultured alveolar macrophages, which were divided into transfected group and non-transfected group. The cells of the transfected group were harvested after the plasmid was transfected for 24 hours, and observed at different time points: normal control with matching normal saline, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Dexamethasone (Dex) stimulated for 4, 8 and 12 hours with concentration of 100 \u03bcg/L and 1\u00d710-5 mol/L, respectively. \u2461Twenty-four hours after transfection, the expressions of GR in total proteins and nuclear proteins were measured with Western Blotting. At the same time, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin 1 \u03b2 (IL-1 \u03b2) in the supernatant of cell culture solution were measured with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). \u2462Analysis of variance was used for comparison among groups, and SNK test for comparison between two groups. RESULTS: \u2460Expression changes of GR after transfection of alveolar macrophages with plasmid: The GR expressions in total proteins of the transfected group were higher than those of the non-transfected group (3.75\u00b10.25, 1.21\u00b10.16, P < 0.01); but GR expressions in nuclear proteins of transfected group had no difference from the non-transfected group (1.15\u00b10.12, 1.09\u00b10.11, P > 0.05). \u2461GR expressions in nuclear proteins after treated with LPS and Dex: After LPS and Dex treatment for 4, 8 and 12 hours, the expressions of the transfected group were 4.02\u00b10.09, 2.13\u00b10.08 and 1.22\u00b10.15, respectively, as were 4.08\u00b10.13, 2.09\u00b10.11 and 1.19\u00b10.17 in the non-transfected group. The two groups had the same tendency in the changes of GR expressions, which reached the peak at 4 hours, but significantly decreased at 8 hour, and reached the lowest level at 12 hour. At the same time point, there were no significant differences between the two groups (P > 0.05). \u2462Expressions of cytokines in the supernatant after LPA and Dex treatment: After LPS and Dex treatment at 4 , 8 and 12 hours, the contents of TNF-\u03b1 in the supernatant of the transfected group were (32.16\u00b13.99), (56.82\u00b18.43) and (73.34\u00b19.97) ng/L, respectively, as were (34.28\u00b14.25), (59.82\u00b19.65) and (71.41\u00b18.35) ng/L in the non-transfected group.

The content of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 \u03b2 in the supernatant increased gradually with time, and reached the peak at 12 hours. There were no obvious differences between the two groups at the same time point (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: \u2460Exogenous GR in alveolar macrophages are over-expressed through gene transfection, which locates in cytoplasm. \u2461After Dex treatment, the GR expressions in nuclear proteins are significantly increased, but gradually decreased. \u2462After transfection, the over-expressed exogenous GR is not found nucleus shifting, and only endogenous GR is detected. \u2463Over-expressed exogenous GR through gene transfection cannot suppress the expressions of inflammatory cytokine in condition of inflammation.",

        "abstract": "To assess the value of Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) double-direct sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA).Ninety adult SD rats were randomly divided into 5 groups, including 4 groups of pulmonary infection by Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus), Candida albicans, mucor, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively, and a colonization group by A. fumigatus in the pharynx oralis (n = 18 each). For the infection models, suspensions of pathogenic bacteria and fungi were instilled into the lungs of the rats by tracheal intubation. For the colonization model, the suspension of A. fumigatus was applied to the nasal cavity and pharynx oralis of the rats. The animals were sacrificed on days 3, 7, and 12 after inoculation, and blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture and used for GM detection. The lung tissues were prepared for routine pathology examination, and hexamethylene tetramine silver staining was used to detect the fungi. A double-direct sandwich ELISA was employed to detect GM optical density index in the serum samples.The lung tissues of rats infected with A. fumigatus, Candida albicans, mucor and Streptococcus pneumoniae all showed remarkable inflammatory reactions, and hyphae were observed in rats with fungal infection (including A. fumigatus and mucor), and spores in rats infected with Candida albicans. The lung tissues of the A. fumigatus colonization rats showed no inflammatory reactions. The serum GM optical density index of the groups infected with A. fumigatus, Candida albicans, mucor and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the A. fumigatus colonization group were 1.69 +/- 0.29, 0.89 +/- 0.46, 0.87 +/- 0.39, 0.77 +/- 0.34 and 0.90 +/- 0.49, respectively. The serum GM optical density index of the IPA group was higher than those of the other 4 groups (P < 0.05). If the cutoff ODI was 1.5, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for diagnosis of IPA in the rats were 78.6%, 87.5%, 57.9% and 94.9%, respectively. The sensitivity for A. fumigatus infection on days 3, 7, and 12 was 60.0%, 80% and 100%, and the specificity was 95.5%, 81.0% and 85.7%, respectively.GM detection could distinguish Aspergillus infection from Candida albicans, mucor, Streptococcus pneumoniae infection and Aspergillus colonization. The sensitivity of the test for the diagnosis of IPA tended to be higher with longer duration of infection. A cutoff ODI of 1.5 showed the best sensitivity and specificity for IPA in this rat model.",

Methods After the cultured AMs were treated with LPS (10mg/ml) and Dex (10 -5 mol/L) for 4h, total RNA was extracted from AMs, then the cDNA was synthesized from total RNA of AMs and amplified using primers SMART\u2162 TM and CDS\u2162oligo (dT) as the base of recombination. The purified PCR products as well as the linearized plasmid pGADT7-Rec were co-transformed into the competent yeast AH109. They were recombined by yeast homologous recombinase in the yeast cells and became the active cyclic plasmid. The transformed yeasts grew in the SD/-Leu plates. All the growing clones were harvested and then constituted the cDNA library. Furthermore, the bait pGBKT7-rGR transformed the yeast AH109 of library was constructed, and the protein molecule interactive with GR was screened. Results cDNA library of AMs was constructed with high multiplication and good capacity. 1.07\u00d7106 recombinants were obtained from the cDNA library. The amplified PCR fragments were between 0.3-1.5kb in size. One true positive clone, obtained by screening the cDNA library, was confirmed to be BAG-1 by sequencing and BLAST.

Viral infections could be an important cause of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) and only a few studies report the prevalence of respiratory viruses on this disease. We aimed to update the review on the prevalence of respiratory viral infection in patients with AECOPD with a meta-analysis. We reviewed the prevalence of respiratory viruses on this disease by searching PubMed systematically to identify primary studies published from Jan 1990 to March 2012. Studies met with seven criteria were extracted for meta-analysis. A total of 17 studies were eligible for the meta-analysis. Weighted overall prevalence of respiratory viruses in patients with AECOPD was 39.3% (95% CI 36.9-41.6) with a high degree of a heterogeneity (I (2) > 75%). In contrast, the rate in stable COPD patients from four studies was 13.6% (95% CI 9.0-18.2) without any apparent heterogeneity. Pooled risk ratio for respiratory viral infection was 4.1 (95% CI 2.0-8.5) for AECOPD as compared with stable COPD. Rhinovirus was the most common virus and with a weighted prevalence of 14.8% (95% CI 13.3-16.5). Respiratory viruses probably are important etiological agents in patients with AECOPD as compared with the stable COPD patients. This result would help to provide better strategies for management of AECOPD and health-care planning.",

Methods: Retrospective analysis of 20 pathologically and/or microbiologically confirmed IPA cases in our hospital from January 2005 to August 2008. Results Group A (with underlying diseases) included 13 patients (underlying malignancy in 9 patients, including 5 cases of hematological malignancy, COPD in 2 patients, pulmonary tuberculosis and bronchiectasis in 1 each). Group B (without underlying disease) included 7 patients (2 patients with a long time of fluffy toy contact, another 1 had exposure to moldy rice, and 3 had exposure to polluted water). All these 20 patients had pulmonary invasion revealed by CT imaging. Multiple changes were identified in 16 patients. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and/or consolidation were revealed in 7 patients. Multiple nodules were seen in 9 patients. Four patients had solitary lesions, including isolated nodules in 2 patients and segment consolidation in the other 2 patients. Pulmonary cavity without fluid level was found in 8 patients (40. 0%). Eighteen cases received antifungal therapy. The overall efficacy rate was 55. 6%. The efficacy rate in group A and B was 45. 5% and 5/7 respectively. The average time to symptomatic relief was ( 12. 0 \u00b1 2. 8) days. The time to lung lesion improvement on CT was (17. 4 \u00b1 2. 9) days. The time to significant CT improvement was (34. 3 \u00b1 9. 9) days. The time to the resolution of active lesion was (56. 4 \u00b1 6. 2) days. Conclusions: IPA may occur in immunocompetent patients without underlying disease. Most IPA patients have bilateral multiple pulmonary nodules and cavities on CT. The time to the resolution of active pulmonary lesions is about 6 weeks.",

        "abstract": "Recently, Cyberknife is a new flame-less stereotactic radiation therapy technology, which has several advantages, such as large dose, high precision and minimizing exposure to the surrounding normal tissue or adjacent vital structures, so it is successful in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of robotic stereotactic radiotherapy-Cyberknife with image guidance and realtime respiratory tracking against clinical stage III-IV peripheral NSCLC.A review of treatment details and outcomes for 31 patients, with 34 tumors with histologically proven cancers treated by Cyberknife at the CyberKnife Center of Nanjing general hospital of Nanjing military command between March 2009 and March 2010 is presented. Of the 31 patients, 15 were adenocarcinoma and 12 were squamous cell cancer. Twenty-eight patients received other forms of antineoplastic therapy such as chemotherapy. A total dose of 36 Gy-60 Gy was prescribed to the 65%-85% isodose line and given in two to five fractions in less than 1 week using the CyberKnife radiosurgery system. CT scans were performed after one-two months, then patients were followed every 3 months.Two patients had complete radiographic responses, 16 patients showed PRs, 7 patients showed SDs. Two patients showed PRs (reduction in tumor size), but developed distant metastases. Response rate was 58% and disease control rate was 81%. All patients tolerated the radiosurgery well, fatigue being the main side effect. No grade 4 or above toxicity was encountered.In this small cohort of patients with advanced peripheral NSCLC, Cyberknife seems to be a safe and has good therapeutic effects with slight adverse reaction, but long time follow-up is necessary to evaluate the survival data and late toxicity.",

Another 100 healthy volunteer donors were chosen serving as the normal control group. Genotypes and alleles of CD14-159 C/T, CD14-260 C/T were determined in patients and healthy controls by means of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. Distributional differences of genotypes and alleles between patients and healthy controls were analyzed. The sepsis patients were divided into survivor group and non-survivor group depending on survival for 28 days. Distributional differences of genotypes and alleles between survivor group and non-survivor group were determined.The rates of CD14-159 C/T genotypes and T-alleles in patients with sepsis were significantly higher than those of healthy volunteers (P=0.005 and P=0.000). There were no significant differences in the rates of CD14-260 C/T genotypes and T-alleles in two groups (P=0.912 and P=0.706). The rates of CD14 -159 C/T genotypes and T-alleles in non-survivors were significantly higher than those of survivors (both P=0.000). There were no significant differences in the rates of CD14-260 C/T genotypes and T-alleles in two groups (P=0.643 and P=0.890).The differences of CD14-159 C/T genotypes of SNPs may be associated with the higher risk of susceptibility and mortality of sepsis.",

        "abstract": "The incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) has increased significantly over the last two decades. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) represent the first line of pulmonary host response to Aspergillus conidia. Recognition of conidia by AMs involves Dectin-1 (CLEC7A), which is a conserved structure to combine \u03b2-glucans. The deficiency of Dectin-1 results in impaired fungal killing and uncontrolled growth of Aspergillus fumigatus. Thus, we hypothesized that high expression of Dectin-1 would enhance the host recognition and fungal killing.We set out to develop an adenoviral vector encoding full-length Dectin-1 (Ad-Dectin-1-EGFP) and then transfect it to MH-S cells. Transfect cell model was verified by using real-time RT-PCR, Western blot, flow cytometric, and confocal microscopic assays. And also, the function of Dectin-1 was explored by measuring cytokine release and killing ability during the course of A. fumigatus infection.We constructed a recombinant adenovirus which could upregulate the expression of Dectin-1 and verified that Dectin-1 was expressed on cell membrane. The function of Dectin-1 was also demonstrated by its ability in promoting the production of cytokines and increasing the killing ability during the course of A. fumigatus infection.An adenoviral vector was successfully applied to the production of a recombinant adenovirus encoding full-length Dectin-1, and also, its function in Aspergillus-induced innate immune response was demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "Objective There is general agreement on the effectiveness of PET/CT(integrated positron emission tomography / computerized tomography)for the diagnosing and the staging of lung cancer.However,there is still a controversy whether PET/CT is effective in the prognosis and treatment evaluation for lung cancer.Therefore,this paper aims at exploring the clinical value of applying the whole body PET/CT to the prognosis of NSCLC.Methods The PET/CT data of 86 patients diagnosed as NSCLC by pathology during the period of Jan 17,2005 to Jan 17,2007 were collected and followed up until Mar 31,2008.Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis and COX Regression Analysis were carried out so as to analyze the survival data and probe into the significance of SUV(Standardized Uptake Value) and staging with PET/CT in the prognosis of NSCLC.In the meanwhile,PET/CT data and regularly-used evaluation factors like the value in ECOG PS,weight loss,gender,pathological type and chemotherapeutic cycles were compared respectively,with the purpose of judging whether these data were of great significance and of marked difference in the prognosis of these NSCLC patients.Results The enrolled subjects were 86 NSCLC patients,67 male(63\u00b114),19 female(57\u00b113),sex ratio 3.5\u2236 1,41 adenocarcinoma,37 squamous cell carcinoma,5 adenocarcinoma with mixed subtypes and 3 large cell carcinoma.59 patients died and 27 maintained life by Mar 31,2008.There was a negative correlation between the SUV and survival time of the patients.When the cutting point of SUV was set to 3,3.5,5,7 and 10,the survival analysis indicated that survival difference within each group was remarkable as the SUV was above 3.5.P=0.044,0.047,0.034.Moreover,there was a close correlation between the value in ECOG PS,weight loss,gender and chemotherapeutic cycles and the survival time of patients.Finally,COX regression analysis indicated that PET/CT was a good survival predictor(P=0.020),which was superior to ECOG PS(P=0.058) and chemotherapeutic cycles(P=0.078).Conclusion The SUV in PET/CT is a good survival predictor to NSCLC patients.The greater the SUV is,the bigger survival risk the patients will run.In addition,TNM staging with PET/CT is a good independent survival predictor as well.The more advanced stage the patients are on,the bigger survival risk the patients will have to face.",

METHODS: All available literature of randomized clinical controlled trails about COX-2 and NSCLC published in China from 1998 to 2008 was pooled from CNKI, VIP and WanFang database. To take into account the possibility of heterogeneity of the studies, a statistical test was performmed. Odds ratio and 95% CI were selected to evaluate the risk of the expression of COX-2 in NSCLC. The Meta-analysis was applied with RevMan 4.2.10 software, and the forest plot and funnel plot of Meta-analysis was worked out. RESULTS: Seven hundred and fifty-six NSCLC cases and 196 controls in a total of 12 studies were included in the present Meta analysis. The OR value was 23.33, and 95%CI was 12.92-42.14. The expression of COX-2 was related to tumor size, the clinical stage, histology and lymph node metastase (P<0.01), but was not related to the differentiation, gender and age (P>0.01). CONCLUSION: COX-2 may play an important role in NSCLC, progress and metaastasis of NSCLC, which might be valuable for the early diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of NSCLC.",

We inhibited the HER2/neu expression with RNA interference (RNAi) technique,and investigated the proliferation of A549 cell in this study. Methods:Firstly a recombinant RNAi expression plasmid targeting to her2/neu gene (named psilence 3.1-HER2) was constructed. After RNAi plasmids being transfected to A549 cells with Lipofectamine,the positive clones were screened with G418. The expression changes of HER2/neu mRNA and protein were evaluated with RT-PCR and Western Blot respectively; Also FCM analysis,MTT method were applied to measure cell cycle,cell growth of A549 cell respectively after the transfection of psilence 3.1-HER2. Results:The psilence 3.1-HER2 was successfully constructed and can specially inhibit HER2/neu mRNA and protein expression after transfection. FCM results showed that cells transfected with psilence 3.1-HER2 increased accumulation of cells in G0/G1 phase with a decrease in the percentage of cells in S-phase,and the growth curve of cells exhibited slower proliferation. Conclusion:The psilence 3.1-HER2 can knockdown her2/neu gene specially and efficiently,transfection of psilence 3.1-HER2 contributes to the depression of A549 cell proliferation. The data described here provided a proof of the concept that vector-based RNAi targeting to her2/neu gene could be used therapeutically for lung cancer.",

Lung function was measured. Induced sputum was obtained and processed for cell differential and the supernatant was assayed for the concentrations of interleukin-4 (IL-4), MMP-9 and TIMP-1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).The percentage of eosinophils in induced sputum in asthmatics (0.181 +/- 0.067) was significantly higher than that in normal control subjects (0.007 +/- 0.005) and in COPD (0.042 +/- 0.017, F = 4.32, P < 0.05). The percentage of neutrophils in induced sputum in patients with COPD (0.500 +/- 0.101) was significantly higher than that in asthmatics (0.30 +/- 0.07) and in normal control subjects (0.26 +/- 0.06, F = 4.13, P < 0.05). The concentrations of IL-4 in asthmatics, COPD and normal control subjects [respectively, (19 +/- 7) x 10(-3) g/L, (14 +/- 6) x 10(-3) g/L, (11 +/- 4) x 10(-3) g/L] did not show significant difference (F = 1.56, all P > 0.05) and did not correlate with the number of eosinophils (r = 0.33, 0.11, 0.19, all P > 0.05) and neutrophil (r = 0.25, 0.39, 0.40, all P > 0.05) and FEV(1) values (predicted r = 0.21, 0.35, 0.17, all P > 0.05). The concentrations of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in induced sputum in asthmatics [(15.9 +/- 6.0) g/L, (19.8 +/- 8.5) g/L, respectively] and COPD [(13.4 +/- 5.1) g/L, (16.7 +/- 7.6) g/L, respectively] were significantly higher than those in normal control subjects [(1.8 +/- 1.1) g/L, (1.3 +/- 0.9) g/L, respectively] (F = 2.99, 4.22, respectively, all P < 0.05). Increased concentration of MMP-9 correlated positively with the percentage of eosinophils in asthmatics (r = 0.71, P < 0.05) and with the percentage of neutrophils in COPD (r = 0.59, P < 0.05), but did not correlate with FEV(1) values (predicted r = 0.22, 0.16, all P > 0.05) and FEV(1)/FVC (r = 0.25, 0.30, all P > 0.05). Increased concentration of TIMP-1 did not correlate with the number of eosinophils (r = 0.27, 0.31, all P > 0.05) and neutrophil (r = 0.20, 0.35, all P > 0.05) in asthmatics and COPD, but correlated inversely with FEV(1) values (predicted, respectively, r = -0.58, -0.62, all P < 0.05). The ratio of MMP-9/TIMP-1 was significantly lower in asthmatics 0.8 +/- 0.7 and COPD 0.8 +/- 0.6 than that in normal control subjects (1.5 +/- 0.6, F = 3.70, P < 0.05). The ratio was not statistically different between asthmatics and COPD (F = 1.78, P > 0.05). In asthmatics and COPD patients, the ratio of MMP-9/TIMP-1 in induced sputum correlated positively with FEV(1%) (respectively, r = 0.56, 0.61, all P < 0.05).An imbalance between MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in induced sputum in asthmatics and COPD is associated with airway inflammation and airflow limitation, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of extracellular matrix remodeling and airflow limitation.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the etiology and clinical characteristics of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in China and to provide evidence for appropriate therapy.We performed a prospective multicenter study in 13 Chinese urban tertiary hospitals. All HAP cases diagnosed at respiratory general ward and respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) from August 2008 to December 2010 were studied. Epidemiological data, etiology and clinical characteristics of enrolled patients were collected. Sputum or tracheal aspirate and blood cultures, Legionella antibodies and Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigen tests were performed. Bacteria to antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed.A total of 610 cases of HAP were diagnosed during the study, with an overall incidence of 1.4% among 42 877 hospitalized patients, while the incidence was 0.9% (362/41 261) in respiratory general ward and 15.4% (248/1616) in RICU. 93.9% (573 cases) of patients had at least one underlying disease, and 91.0% (555 cases) had exposure to at least one antimicrobial agent within 90 days prior to HAP diagnosis. Pathogens were identified in 487 patients, with Acinetobacter baumannii [30.0% (183/610)], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [22.0% (134/610)], Staphylococcus aureus [13.4% (82/610)] and Klebsiella pneumonia [9.7% (59/610)] being the most common pathogens. Eighteen patients (3.0%) had infection with fastidious bacteria. A. baumannii and S. aureus were the more frequent pathogens in the ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) cases [50.5% (97/192) and 21.4% (41/192)] as compared to non-VAP cases [20.6% (86/418) and 9.8% (41/418), P < 0.01]. A. baumannii and S. aureus were also frequent pathogens in cases with a score of more than 20 by the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHEII) scoring [45.7% (69/151) and 20.5% (31/151)], as compared to cases with a score of less than 20 of APACHE II [24.8% (114/459) and 11.1% (51/459), P < 0.01]. A. baumannii showed high resistance rates to carbapenems [more than 70% (109/142)], and the susceptibility to cefoperazone/sulbactam, polymyxin B and tigecycline were 40.8% (58/142), 99.3% (141/142) and 95.8% (136/142) respectively. Resistance rates of P. aeruginosa to meropenem and imipenem were 48.8% (40/82) and 70.7% (58/82) respectively. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) accounted for 87.8% (43/49) in all strains of S. aureus. Mortality rate of VAP cases was 34.5% (61/177), significantly more than that of HAP patients [22.3% (135/605), P < 0.05]. The average hospital stay of patients with HAP was (23.8 \u00b1 20.5) days, significantly more than that of the average for inpatients [(13.2 \u00b1 13.6) days, P < 0.01] during the study period. Mean costs of HAP were (108 950 \u00b1 116 608) yuan, significantly higher than the average hospital costs of respiratory inpatients (17 999 \u00b1 33 364) yuan.Among Chinese patients hospitalized in urban tertiary medical centers, HAP incidence and mortality rate were high, which increased the patients' hospital stay and the medical costs. Common pathogens were A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and K. pneumonia. The common bacteria of HAP in China showed high resistance rates to antibiotics.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate changes of TLR2 mRNA expression in lung of a mouse model of Chlamydia Pneumoniae pneumonitis,and to explore the possible mechanism of signal transduction.Methods Ninety-six male C3H/HeJ mice were randomly divided into four groups as follows:a control group,a model group,a SB203580 intervened group,and a pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate(PDTC) intervened group.Chlamydia Pneumoniae pneumonitis was induced by intranasally inoculated with 4.0\u00d7106 IFU/mL of C.Pneumoniae per mouse in the model group and two intervened groups.Then the intervened groups were intraperitoneally injected with the p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and nuclear factor kappa B(NF-\u03baB) inhibitor PDTC,respectively.Six mice in each group were randomly killed in 1st,4th,7th and 14th day.The expressional changes of TLR2 mRNA in the mice lung tissue were measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR.The concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 in the lung homogenate were measured by ELISA.Results TLR2 mRNA expression in the lung tissue significantly increased after C.Pneumoniae infection,peaking at 4th and 7th days,then decreased after 14th day.Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1(TNF-\u03b1) was also elevated in the lung tissue after C.Pneumoniae challenging.Both SB203580 and PDTC treatment effectively inhibited TNF-\u03b1 and TLR2 mRNA expressions in lung.The inhibitory effect was more obvious by SB203580 treatment.Conclusion C.Pneumoniae can upregulate the expressions of TLR2 and TNF-\u03b1 in lung,and TLR2/MAPK and TLR2/NF-\u03baB signal pathways may be involved in Chlamydia Pneumoniae pneumonitis.",

Methods: We retrieved the clinical trials and references relevant to cryotherapy combined with chemotherapy and cryotherapy alone in the treatment of advanced NSCLC in the databases of PUBMED, EBMASE, OVID and CNKI, et al, and evaluated the methodological quality of the included trials. Meta-analyses were conducted with the Revman 5.0 software. Four studies and 423 cases of advanced NSCLC were included. Results: The pooled OR of the effectiveness of the combined therapy was 2.09, the 95% CI was 1.40-3.14 and the RR of 1-year survival was 1.30 (0.98, 1.72). Compared with cryotherapy alone, the combined therapy achieved a higher rate short-term efficacy but could improve the rate of 1-year survival. Conclusion: Cryotherapy combined with chemotherapy has a better short-term effect than cryotherapy alone on advanced NSCLC, but its long-term efficacy remains to be further investigated.",

MethodsBetween January 1995 and December 2009,Medline,EMbase,BIOSIS and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant English articles on detection of ADA from CSF in diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis.Quality evaluation of these studies was performed using QUADAS standards.The random effect model of Metadisc 1.4 and SPSS 13.0 softwares was used for pooled analysis of the sensitivity,specificity and other indexes of ADA in diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis in all studies.The receiver operating characteristic curves were then generated and studied for its use in diagnosis. ResultsNine studies were finally included in this meta-analysis.The overall sensitivity of ADA in diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis was 0.77(95%CI 0.72~0.82),specificity 0.91(95%CI 0.90~0.93),positive likelihood ratio 7.93(5.85~10.76),negative likelihood ratio 0.28(0.19~0.41) and area under curve(AUC) of SROC 0.9129.However,the specificity of differential diagnosis between tuberculous and purulent meningitis was decreased to 0.75(95%CI 0.67~0.82). ConclusionBoth sensitivity and specificity of ADA were favorably high in diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis.The detection of ADA in CSF might contribute to diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis;however,this could lead to lowered efficiency in differential diagnosis against purulent meningitis,hence a need for references to other laboratory indexes.",

First, our in vitro studies reveal that recombinant HMGB1 (rHMGB1) activates myeloid DCs to produce IL-23 in vitro, and rHMGB1-activated DCs prime na\u00efve lymphocytes to produce the Th17 cytokine IL-17A. Second, we demonstrate that anti-HMGB1 neutralizing antibody attenuates HMGB1 expression, neutrophilic inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and Th17-related cytokine secretion in vivo by using a murine model of neutrophilic asthma induced by ovalbumin (OVA) plus lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Furthermore, anti-HMGB1 neutralizing antibody decreases the number of Th17 cells in lung cells and suppresses the production of IL-23 by lung CD11C(+) APCs. Finally, we show that intranasal adoptive transfer of rHMGB1-activated DCs was sufficient to restore lung neutrophilic inflammation and the Th17 response in a DC-driven model of asthma, whereas the transfer of rHMGB1 plus anti-HMGB1-treated mDCs significantly reduced these inflammation phenotypes. These data suggest, for the first time, that HMGB1 drives the DC-polarized Th17-type response in allergic lung inflammation and that blocking HMGB1 may benefit the attenuation of neutrophilic airway inflammation in asthma.",

        "abstract": "Objective Monoclone antibody targeted to epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR) was proved to enhance the chemosensitivity of pulmonary adenocarcinoma.Nimotuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that recognizes the human EGFR.This study was to investigate the effects of Nimotuzumab alone and in combination with chemotherapy on human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell lines with different levels of EGFR overexpression and mutations of EGFR,KRAS and PI3KCA.Methods The EGFR status of three cell lines A549,SPC-A1 and SPC-A1/DTX were detected by immunohistochemistry.PCR sequencing and a mutant-enriched liquidchip were used in detection of EGFR,KRAS and PI3KCA mutations.We then evaluated nimotuzumab effects on growth,cell cycle distribution and complement-dependent cytotoxicity(CDC).These cancer cell lines were treated with nimotuzumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy in vitro to determine the cooperative effects.Results The status of EGFR:A549(-),SPC-A1(+),SPC-A1/DTX(3 +).A549 with KRAS/Codon13 and PI3KCA/E9,E20 mutations.SPC-A1 with no mutation,and SPC-A1/DTX with PI3KCA/E20 mutation.A obvious shift into the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and CDC effects were revealed in EGFR-expressing cell lines after 24 hours of nimotuzumab treatment.Cooperative growth inhibitory effects were observed in EGFR-expressing cell lines both in chemotherapy with cisplatin or docetaxel.Conclusion Nimotuzumab alone couldn\u2032t inhibit the growth of A549 and has no cooperative growth inhibitory with chemotherapy.The cooperative growth inhibitory effects of nimotuzumab and chemotherapy depended more on the expression of EGFR than the mutations of EGFR,KRAS or PI3KCA.Proper patient selection will be critical to the success of nimotuzumab.",

        "abstract": "To observe the changes of TLR-2, Dectin-1 expression on endothelial cells, and to explore their role in the immune response after contact with Aspergillus fumigatus.Aspergillus fumigatus and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were co-incubated. Cells were collected respectively after incubation for 0 h, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h and 6 h. TLR2 and Dectin-1 receptor expressions were detected by flow cytometry, and their protein was measured by Western blot. The distribution of the receptors in the cells were observed by immunofluorescence.TLR2 and Dectin-1 were expressed on the endothelial cell surface in quiescent condition. The mean fluorescence intensity of TLR2 on endothelial cells decreased from 45 to 13 stimulation by Aspergillus fumigatus, but the mean fluorescence intensity of Dectin-1 increased from 13 to 35 in the first 2 hours and then decreased. By Western blot, the electrophoresis strip of Dectin-1 was most bright in 2 hours after contact with the fungus, and then decreased 4 and 6 hours. TLR2 did not change significantly. Dectin-1 with fluorescent labeling was seen in spores and hyphae as well as in the cell membrane under confocal microscope. TLR2 was detected only on cell surface.TLR2 and Dectin-1 were expressed by endothelial cells, and may be useful in the identification of Aspergillus fumigatus.",

Methods The clinical data of 16 patients with ABPA were retrospectively analyzed to summarize the causes of misdiagnosis. Results 10 cases were male,and the rest 6 cases were female. The peripheral blood eosinophil cells( PBEC) and total IgE( T-IgE) increased at to a certain level in all patients,and the test of GM and G increased in some patients. Their pulmonary function showed a different degree of disorder. The most common CT images included central bronchiectasis,patchy consolidation,lobar,and consolidation shadows. 16 patients were all initially misdiagnosed,and the duration to confirm their disease was 2 to 25 years,with an average of 13 \u00b1 2 years.

G-test was used to measure the concentration of 1, 3-beta-D-glucan in the plasma.The concentration of 1, 3-beta-D-glucan in plasma of patients with IFI [(29.5+/-11.5) ng/L] was significantly higher than that of patients with bacterial pneumonia [(13.1+/-5.2) ng/L], fungal colonization [(12.7+/-5.1) ng/L], and healthy controls [(11.7+/-3.5) ng/L], P<0.01. The concentration of 1, 3-beta-D-glucan in patients with bacterial pneumonia was not different as compared to that of patients with fungal colonization, and healthy controls, P>0.05. The concentration of 1, 3-beta-D-glucan in plasma of patients with invasive aspergillosis and invasive candidiasis were (24.7+/-5.8) ng/L and (33.3+/-11.4) ng/L, respectively, the difference being not significant, P>0.05. The concentration of 1, 3-beta-D-glucan in plasma of a patients with invasive pulmonary Cryptococcus neoformans infection and a patient with histoplasmosis were 13.6 ng/L and 25.7 ng/L, respectively. If 20 ng/L was taken as the cut-off value, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 1, 3-beta-D-glucan were 84%, 91%, 84% and 91% respectively.The concentration of 1, 3-beta-D-glucan in plasma of patients with IFI increases markedly, which indicates that the detection of 1, 3-beta-D-glucan in plasma is a useful method to diagnose IFI, but can not be used to differentiate aspergillosis from yeast fungus infection. If Fungitec-G kit is used to detect 1, 3-beta-D-glucan and 20 ng/L is used as the cut-off value, the sensitivity and specificity for IFI are high.",

Methods Three groups were included in this experiment after the establishment of an in vitro model of HUVECs infected with Aspergillus fumigatus hyphae: CD negative control group: no stimulus to HUVECs; Aspergillus fumigatus hyphae group I: induced by 105 CFU/mL of Aspergillus fumigatus hyphae; (3)Aspergillus fumigatus hyphae group II: induced by 106 CFU/mL of Aspergillus fumigatus hyphae. Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis of HUVECs at 2, 4, and 8 h following infection. Results The apoptosis rate of HUVECs increased gradually at 2, 4 and 8 h in Aspergillus fumigatus hyphae group I and U (P<0. 05). Compared to negative control group at the corresponding time points, the apoptosis rate of HUVECs in Aspergillus fumigatus hyphae groups increased significantly at 2, 4, and 8 h (P< 0. 01). Moreover, it was higher in Aspergillus fumigatus hypha group II than that in group I (P<0. 05). Conclusions Aspergillus fumigatus hyphae can induce HUVECs apoptosis. Within certain period of time, apoptosis rate increases with the time of hyphae induction of HUVECs. At the same time point, the higher the concentration of Aspergillus fumigatus hyphae, the higher apoptosis rate of HUVECs.",

        "abstract": "Tristetraprolin (TTP) is an RNA-binding protein which can bind to the AU-rich elements (AREs) at the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of target mRNA and promote mRNA deadenylation and degradation. We have shown in a previous study that TTP regulates tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1)-induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8), both of whose mRNAs have AREs in the 3'-UTR, in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC) through destabilizing target mRNAs, nevertheless, the mechanism by which TTP promotes mRNA decay remains unclear. Observations have indicated that TTP can interact with CAF1 (CNOT7/hCAF1 in human), a subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex with deadenylase activity. Another study illustrated that TTP can directly bind to CNOT1, the scaffold subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex. The present study showed that TTP bound to the AREs of ICAM-1 and IL-8 mRNAs and was coimmunoprecipitated with intracellular ICAM-1 and IL-8 mRNAs. TTP, CNOT7 and CNOT1 were coimmunoprecipitated in HPMEC. CNOT7 silencing stabilized ICAM-1 and IL-8 mRNAs and increased ICAM-1 and IL-8 production following TNF-\u03b1 stimulation. These results, together with our previous study, suggest that CNOT7/hCAF1 is involved in ICAM-1 and IL-8 regulation by TTP in HPMEC.",

        "abstract": "Nucleic acid detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is emerging as a sensitive and rapid diagnostic tool. PCR assays on serum have the potential to be a practical diagnostic tool. However, PCR on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) has not been well established. We performed a systematic review of published studies to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of PCR assays on BALF for invasive aspergillosis (IA).Relevant published studies were shortlisted to evaluate the quality of their methodologies. A bivariate regression approach was used to calculate pooled values of the method sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios. Hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curves were used to summarize overall performance. We calculated the post-test probability to evaluate clinical usefulness. Potential heterogeneity among studies was explored by subgroup analyses.Seventeen studies comprising 1191 at-risk patients were selected. The summary estimates of the BALF-PCR assay for proven and probable IA were as follows: sensitivity, 0.91 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.79-0.96); specificity, 0.92 (95% CI, 0.87-0.96); positive likelihood ratio, 11.90 (95% CI, 6.80-20.80); and negative likelihood ratio, 0.10 (95% CI, 0.04-0.24). Subgroup analyses showed that the performance of the PCR assay was influenced by PCR assay methodology, primer design and the methods of cell wall disruption and DNA extraction.PCR assay on BALF is highly accurate for diagnosing IA in immunocompromised patients and is likely to be a useful diagnostic tool. However, further efforts towards devising a standard protocol are needed to enable formal validation of BALF-PCR.",

        "abstract": "Objective The use of dendritic vaccine is a new approach to the treatment of asthma.This study investigated the effect of immature dendritic cells(imDC) treated by thymic stromal lymphopoetin receptor(TSLPR) knock-down on the antigen-induced airway allergic inflammatory reaction and Th1/Th2 imbalance in mice with asthma,so as to provide a theoretical and experimental foundation for the treatment of asthma by immune modulation.Methods Thirty-six C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into a TSLPR-knocked-down imDC treatment group(group A),an imDC treatment group(group B),and an asthma group(group C).The asthma model was established in the C57BL/6 mice by immunization with ovalbumin(OVA) and Al(OH)3.The mice in the three groups were given intranasal instillation of 100 \u03bcl cell suspension containing 1\u00d7106 TSLPR-knocked-down imDC,imDC,and phosphate buffer saline(PBS),respectively.The cellular composition of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was analyzed after challenge in every group.The lung lymphocytes were isolated for detection of cytokine secretion and FCM analysis of intracellular IFN\u03b3 and IL-4 positive T cells.Histological changes in the lung were compared among the three groups.Results Compared with groups B and C,administration of TSLPR-knocked-down imDC markedly inhibited eosinophilia in the lung(P<0.01),suppressed IL-4 and IL-5 production and enhanced IFN\u03b3 production in the pulmonary T cells.The percentage of CD4+ IFN\u03b3+ pulmonary T cells and the ratio of IFN\u03b3+ to IL/4 + lung lymphocytes were significantly increased(P<0.01),but the percentage of CD4+ IL-4+ pulmonary T cells obviously decreased(P<0.01).Allergic inflammatory reaction was remarkably inhibited in the airway and lung tissues of the asthma mice.Conclusion Intranasal instillation of TSLPR-knocked-down imDC can significantly inhibit antigen-induced airway allergic inflammatory reaction,the mechanism of which may involve its regulation of Th1/Th2 imbalance by inhibiting TSLP-TSLPR signal transduction.",

        "abstract": "Glucocorticoids have been widely used in various inflammatory disorders, and the transcriptional repression of inflammatory mediators has been considered to be the main mechanism of action. However, a previous study showed that dexamethasone inhibited interleukin 8 (IL-8) expression by promoting IL-8 mRNA decay, which implies a posttranscriptional regulation. Nevertheless, by which mechanism dexamethasone destabilized IL-8 mRNA was unclear. Another study indicated that an RNA-binding protein, tristetraprolin (TTP), could be induced by dexamethasone. TTP can bind to AU-rich elements (ARE) in the 3'-untranslated region of target mRNAs and promotes mRNA degradation. So, we speculated that dexamethasone destabilized IL-8 mRNA by upregulating TTP expression. Here, we report that dexamethasone reduced IL-8 expression through destabilizing IL-8 mRNA in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs). Dexamethasone stimulation increased TTP mRNA and protein levels. TTP silencing led to mRNA stabilization and protein upregulation of IL-8. These results provide the evidence that the glucocorticoid, in HPMECs, inhibits IL-8 expression through TTP at the posttranscriptional level.",

        "abstract": "The effectiveness of the combination therapy of triazole and echinocandin in treatment of invasive aspergillosis (IA) remains controversial. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy of combination therapy of triazole and echinocandin in treatment of IA.Relevant articles on the combination therapy of triazole and echinocandin in IA, including the animal studies and clinical studies from January 1966 to October 2013, were searched on Web of Science, PubMed and Cochrane Library. The prolongation of survival of the combination therapy of triazole and echinocandin in IA was performed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI).Nine animal studies with a total of 1,582 animals and five clinical trials totaling 872 patients were included. The survival of the included animal studies with combination therapy was significantly prolonged compared with echinocandin alone [RR =2.26, (95% CI, 1.79-2.87; P<0.00001)], but no statistical difference compared with monotherapy of triazole [RR =1.19, (95% CI, 0.98-1.44; P=0.08)]. Of the four human cohort studies, two studies observed that the combination therapy of triazole and echinocandin was associated with a significant reduction in mortality compared with other treatments, and one study might be considered as a preferable therapy [HR =0.58, (95% CI, 0.3-1.14; P=0.117)]. While another study revealed that there was no significant difference among the combination therapy of triazole and echinocandin and either of the monotherapy. In the randomized clinical trial (RCT), of the 135 patients who received the combination therapy, 39 died, while 55 died out of 142 patients who received monotherapy (P=0.08, 95% CI, -21.4, 1.09) by week 12.The combination therapy of triazole and echinocandin in treating IA results in a trend towards improved overall survival in animals' studies and clinical studies. Well-designed RCTs and further improved clinical trials are necessary to study the effectiveness of the combination therapy.",

        "abstract": "To assess the value of galactomannan (GM) double-direct sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA).A search in MEDLINE, EMbase, OVID, CBMdisc and CHKD from Jan. 1991 to Dec. 2008 was conducted to collect all articles about diagnostic tests of serum GM detection. Then the methodological quality was assessed by QUADAS-items, sources of heterogeneity investigated, pooled effect quantities evaluated, and meta-analysis studies, SROC curves, and subgroup analysis performed.Thirty-six articles with a population of 4959 patients were included. The average prevalence of IA was 10%(532/4959). Our meta-analysis reported a median heterogeneity (I(2) = 48.6%, P < 0.05), with a pooled DOR value of 19.10 (95%CI 12.67 - 28.79), a pooled sensitivity of 0.66 (95%CI 0.61 - 0.70), a pooled specificity of 0.90 (95%CI 0.89 - 0.90), a pooled positive likelihood ratio of 5.48 (95%CI 4.27 - 7.02), a pooled negative likelihood ratio of 0.38 (95%CI 0.29 - 0.50), and an area under curve of SROC 0.88. The rate of underdiagnosis of serum GM detection was 34% (168/490) and the rate of misdiagnosis was 10% (466/4469). With a rise in the cut-off value the sensitivity of GM test decreased and specificity increased. Two consecutive positive tests decreased the sensitivity but increased the specificity. Age had no significant effect on the diagnosis by GM test. Both antifungal prophylaxis and antifungal therapy had no significant effect on sensitivity and specificity of GM test for IA diagnosis.Serum GM detection is an effective diagnostic tool for invasive aspergillosis in high-risk populations.",

        "abstract": "Objective:Lock of specific and efficient therapy leads to the high mortality rate of acute lung injury(ALI) and acute respiratory distress(ARDS).Ethyl pyruvate as a novel anti-inflammatory agent,protects against lethal sepsis and systemic inflammation.To observe the effects of ethyl pyruvate(EP) treatment on oleic acid-induced ALI in rats,and investigate the mechanisms of its protective effect. Methods:16 SD rats were randomly divided into three equal groups namely: normal control group,oleic acid-induced lung injury group(OA-group) and EP-treatment group(EP-group).OA-group was administered oleic acid(0.15ml/kg) via right jugular vein.In EP-group,40mg/kg was injected intraperitoneally,followed 10min later by OA infusion.At the 4 hours animals were sacrificed.Human serum albumin(Alb) labeled with 125I(125I-Alb,6ml/Kg) were infused over 1min via right jugular vein exactly 1 hour before the rats were sacrificed.Serum TNF-\u03b1\u3001IL-6\u3001VWF were determined by ELISA.The lungs were harvested to measure pulmonary permeability index(PPI),extravascular lung water(EVLW) and lung wet/dry ratio.The expressions of lung tissue mitogen-activated protein kinase(ERK1/2,P38 and JNK MAPK) were analysed by Western blotting.Results: Rats had significantly improved lung histopathology in EP-group compared to OA-group.The PPI\u3001EVWL\u3001W/D of OA-group were significantly higher than that of normal control group(P<0.01) and EP-group(P<0.01).OA-group significantly increased the concentration of these cytokines(TNF-\u03b1\u3001IL-6\u3001VWF)(P<0.01) in serum.The lung tissue levels of phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-P38 MAPK expressions were markedly higher in all group compared to heparin treatment group.There were no markedly differences of phospho-JNK MAPK expression in three groups.Conclusion: Ethyl Pyruvate markedly inhibited the expressions of phospho-ERK12 and phospho-P38 MAPK,down-regulated the inflammatory reaction and significantly improved lung injury in oleic acid-induced rat.",

        "abstract": "Vitamin D plays an important role in pulmonary resistance and immunity, and its deficiency has been linked to various respiratory infections. Little is known about the effect of vitamin D deficiency on host pulmonary defense to Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus).Mice raised on vitamin D sufficient or deficient diets were infected intratracheally with A. fumigatus conidia. Mortality, fungal growth, weight loss and lung histology were monitored. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) were stimulated with A. fumigatus conidia in vitro. The kinetics of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6), chemokines (CXCL1, CCL3), and pattern recognition receptors (Toll-like receptor [TLR] 2, TLR 4 and dectin-1) expression in the lungs and AMs were measured.Upon A. fumigatus infection, vitamin D deficient mice showed higher mortality, greater fungal load, and more weight loss than its sufficient counterparts. Vitamin D deficient mice demonstrated aggravated and prolonged histological evidence of lung inflammation as well as enhanced BAL cell counts, dominated by neutrophils after A. fumigatus inoculation. Increased basal levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs and AMs from na\u00efve vitamin D deficient mice were observed. Upon A. fumigatus exposure, vitamin D deficiency led to enhanced and sustained expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, CXCL1 and CCL3 both in vivo and in vitro. Up-regulation of TLR2, TLR4 and dectin-1was observed in the lungs and AMs from vitamin D deficient mice both at baseline and after A. fumigatus exposure.Vitamin D deficiency causes defective pulmonary resistance to A. fumigatus in mice, possibly by the enhanced basal expression of pattern recognition receptors and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which induced excessive inflammatory response in response to A. fumigatus challenge.",

        "abstract": "Thymic stromal lymphopoietin(TSLP) can activate dendritic cells(DC) through the combination with TSLP receptor(TSLPR) on DC surface,resulting in Th1/Th2 imbalance in asthma.The aim of this study is to find out the feasibility of the soluble TSLPR receptor(mTSLPR-Ig),constituted by the fusion protein of the extracellular segment of mouse TSLPR and Fc segment of mouse immunoglobulin,to inhibit the activation of DC by TSLP in vitro.The murine myeloid DCs were isolated and identified,and then mTSLPR-IG was added to the culture system,in which DCs were effected byTSLP(TSLP-DCs).The influence of mTSLP-Ig on the expression of surface co-stimulatory molecules CD80,CD86 and CD40 was analyzed by FCM.In addition.the impact of the added mTSLPR-Ig fusion protein on the proliferative activity of CD4+ cells was analyzed by FCM and the changes of cytokine,such as IL-4,IL-5,IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10,in the cultural supernatants were detected by ELISA.It was demonstrated that expressions of surface co-stimulatory molecules CD80,CD86 and CD40 were significantly inhibited by fusion protein mTSLPR-Ig and mTSLPR-Ig also could inhibit significantly the proliferative activity of the antigen-specific T cells induced by this fusion protein,and promote the secretion of IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 in the cultural supernatants,but inhibit the expression levels of IL-4 and IL-5.From these observation,it is evident that fusion protein mTSLPR-Ig can inhibit the activation of the TSLP-DCs,resulting Th2 biasis,and it is expected that this protein may play some role in the treatment of the TSLP-related disorders,such as asthma or allergic dermatitis.",

        "abstract": "Dectin-2, a C-type lectin receptor (CLR), plays an essential role in mediating nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\ufffd\ufffdB) activation and anti-fungal immunity in response to Candida albicans infection. However, the molecular mechanisms and function of Dectin-2 signaling in response to infection by the pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus have not been characterized. In order to characterize Dectin-2 signaling in response to A. fumigatus infection, activation of Dectin-2 was analyzed at both transcriptional and translational levels. Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) phosphorylation, NF-\ufffd\ufffdB activation and cytokine production downstream of Dectin-2 activation were also investigated. In addition, Dectin-2-Syk function and its ability to mediate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and elimination of A. fumigatus conidia was examined. We demonstrate that Syk is involved in Dectin-2-induced I\ufffd\ufffdB\ufffd\ufffd (inhibitor of kappa B protein) phosphorylation and NF-\ufffd\ufffdB activation following A. fumigatus stimulation in a time dependent manner. Silencing of Dectin-2 and Syk as well as Syk inhibition blocks NF-\ufffd\ufffdB activation and cytokine secretion. Furthermore, the killing of A. fumigatus conidia and ROS production are significantly affected by Dectin-2 or Syk silencing as well as Syk inhibition. Swelling and germination of the fungus followed by hyphae formation and not the resting and heat-inactivated form of A. fumigatus mediate the activation of Dectin-2 signaling. In conclusion, Syk plays an essential role in I\ufffd\ufffdB\ufffd\ufffd kinase phosphorylation, NF-\ufffd\ufffdB activation, and ROS production mediated by Dectin-2 activation in response to A. fumigatus infection. ? 2013 Elsevier GmbH.",

Methods: The experiment was carried out in the Laboratory of Respiration Diseases of Nanjing General Hospital of Nanjing Military Area Command of Chinese PLA from February to September in 2006. Ten Wistar rats of SPF grade were adopted, aged 4-5 weeks and either gender. All cultured alveolar macrophages were isolated with bronchoalveolar lavage, and randomly divided into normal control group, negative control group, SiBAG-1\u03b1 transfection group and SiBAG-1\u03b2 transfection group. Targeted sequences of BAG-1 gene by RNAi were screened on line and corresponding nucleotide sequences were inserted into pSilencer3. 1H1-hygro vector. Two recombinant RNAi expression plasmids targeting to BAG-1 gene (named SiBAG-1\u03b1 and SiBAG-1\u03b2) were constructed, and confirmed by sequencing prior to transfecting rat alveolar macrophages. The expression changes of BAG-1 protein in nucleu were evaluated with immunocytochemistry technique, and integral absorptances in nucleus region indicated relative intensity of BAG-1 expression; Simultaneously GR activity was evaluated through method of electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and was demonstrated by product of multiplication of gray scale and areas of scanned band. Results: 1 Plasmids SIBAG-1\u03b1 and SiBAG-1\u03b2 (sequence of Shanghai Boya Company were 1524-036 and 1524-037, respectively) were successfully constructed and identified by inserting the synthesized oligonucleotide fragment to pSilencer3.1Hl-hygro. 2 Compared with normal control group, BAG-1 protein expression in nuclear protein of SiBAG-1\u03b1 transfection group were significantly decreased (03.46\u00b10.75, 13.58\u00b10.47, P < 0.05), but no difference was found in SiBAG-1\u03b2 transfection group (15.27\u00b10.89, 13.58\u00b10.47, P > 0.05). 3 Similar results were the increased GR activity in SiBAG-1\u03b1 transfection group compared with normal control group (9.62\u00b10.47, 2.65\u00b10.22, P < 0.05), but no difference to SiBAG-1\u03b2 transfection group (2.79\u00b10.57, 2.65\u00b10.22, P > 0.05). Conclusion: A recombinant RNAi expression plasmids SiBAG-1\u03b1, which can knockdown BAG-1 gene specially and efficiently, is successfully constructed. Repressing BAG-1 expression can bring the recovery of anti-inflammatory activity of GR, which can reverse glucocorticoid resistance induced by the decrease of GR activity. BAG-1 is a new target of reversing glucocorticoid resistance.",

Many studies have investigated whether prophylactic inhalation of amphotericin B (AMB) reduces the incidence of IPA, but no definitive conclusions have been reached. The present meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic inhalation of AMB for the prevention of IPA.MEDLINE and other databases were searched for relevant articles published until December 2013. Randomized controlled trials that compared aerosolized AMB with placebo were included. Two reviewers independently assessed and extracted the data of all trials.Six animal studies and two clinical trials involving 768 high-risk patients were eligible. The animal studies showed lower overall mortality rate among animals that underwent aerosolized AMB prophylaxis (odds ratio (OR) 0.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08-0.21). Similarly, the clinical trials showed a lower incidence of IPA among patients who underwent aerosolized AMB prophylaxis (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22-0.79).This analysis provides evidence supporting the notion that the prophylactic use of aerosolized AMB effectively reduces the incidence of IPA among high-risk patients.",

        "abstract": "Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) is one of the most common fungi to cause diseases in humans. Recent evidence has demonstrated that airway epithelial cells play an important role in combating A. fumigatus through inflammatory responses. Human airway epithelial cells have been proven to synthesize the active vitamin D, which plays a key role in regulating inflammation. The present study was conducted to investigate the impact of A. fumigatus infection on the activation of vitamin D and the role of vitamin D activation in A. fumigatus-elicited antifungal immunity in normal human airway epithelial cells. We found that A. fumigatus swollen conidia (SC) induced the expression of 1\u03b1-hydroxylase, the enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of active vitamin D, and vitamin D receptor (VDR) in 16HBE cells and led to increased local generation of active vitamin D. Locally activated vitamin D amplified SC-induced expression of antimicrobial peptides in 16HBE cells but attenuated SC-induced production of cytokines in an autocrine fashion. Furthermore, we identified \u03b2-glucan, the major A. fumigatus cell wall component, as the causative agent for upregulation of 1\u03b1-hydroxylase and VDR in 16HBE cells. Therefore, activation of vitamin D is inducible and provides a bidirectional regulation of the responses to A. fumigatus in 16HBE cells.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to compare the diagnostic value of galactomannan (GM) detection in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum samples from nonneutropenic patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) and determine the optimal BALF GM cutoff value for pulmonary aspergillosis. GM detection in BALF and serum samples was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 128 patients with clinically suspected nonneutropenic pulmonary aspergillosis between June 2014 and June 2016. On the basis of the clinical and pathological diagnoses, 8 patients were excluded because their diagnosis was uncertain. The remaining 120 patients were diagnosed with either IPA ( = 37), community-acquired pneumonia (CAP;  = 59), noninfectious diseases ( = 19), or tuberculosis ( = 5). At a cutoff optical density index (ODI) value of \u22650.5, the sensitivity of BALF GM detection was much higher than that of serum GM detection (75.68% versus 37.84%;  = 0.001), but there was no significant difference between their specificities (80.72% versus 87.14%;  = 0.286). At a cutoff value of \u22651.0, the sensitivity of BALF GM detection was still much higher than that of serum GM detection (64.86% versus 24.32%;  < 0.001), and their specificities were similar (90.36% versus 95.71%;  = 0.202). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that when the BALF GM detection cutoff value was 0.7, its diagnostic value for pulmonary aspergillosis was optimized, and the sensitivity and specificity reached 72.97% and 89.16%, respectively. BALF GM detection was valuable for the diagnosis of IPA in nonneutropenic patients, and its diagnostic value was superior to that of serum GM detection. The optimal BALF GM cutoff value was 0.7.",

        "abstract": "Disordered tumor cell metabolism is involved in the process of tumorigenesis. Proline metabolism is of critical importance for tumor cells, and pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1), a key proline biosynthesis enzyme, has been reported to be overexpressed in prostate cancer and to promote tumor cell growth in breast cancer. The present study investigated the relationship between PYCR1 and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The results revealed that PYCR1 was overexpressed in NSCLC tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. High PYCR1 expression was associated with poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC. Following knockdown of PYCR1 by small interfering RNA, cell proliferation was revealed to be significantly inhibited and the cell cycle was arrested, while apoptosis was increased in SPC-A1 and H1703 NSCLC cells. Furthermore, the silencing of PYCR1 resulted in the downregulation of expression of the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1, the regulator of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway B-cell lymphoma-2, and B-cell lymphoma-extra large. The results of the present study indicated the involvement of PYCR1 in the proliferation and apoptosis of NSCLC. Therefore, PYCR1 may be a novel therapeutic target for inhibiting cell proliferation in lung cancer.",

        "abstract": "Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a key mediator to alert the immune dysfunction by acting on P2 receptors. Here, we found that allergen challenge caused an increase of ATP secretion in a murine model of neutrophilic asthma, which correlated well with neutrophil counts and interleukin-17 production. When ATP signaling was blocked by intratracheal administration of the ATP receptor antagonist suramin before challenge, neutrophilic airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and Th17-type responses were reduced significantly. Also, neutrophilic inflammation was abrogated when airway ATP levels were locally neutralized using apyrase. Furthermore, ATP promoted the Th17 polarization of splenic CD4 T cells from DO11.10 mice in vitro. In addition, ovalbumin (OVA) challenge induced neutrophilic inflammation and Th17 polarization in DO11.10 mice, whereas administration of suramin before challenge alleviated these parameters. Thus, ATP may serve as a marker of neutrophilic asthma, and local blockade of ATP signaling might provide an alternative method to prevent Th17-mediated airway inflammation in neutrophilic asthma.",

        "abstract": "Periostin is an extracellular matrix protein involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, the role of serum periostin as a surrogate marker for treatment efficacy is still unknown. In 122 advanced non-small cell lung cancer cases, 37 patients with benign lung disease and 40 healthy controls, serum periostin was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The associations of serum periostin levels with the clinic-pathological parameters, chemotherapy response, and clinical outcomes of non-small cell lung cancer patients were analyzed. Serum periostin levels were significantly higher in non-small cell lung cancer patients, and it was related significantly to bone metastasis ( p\u2009=\u20090.021). Serum periostin of 65 non-small cell lung cancer patients were detected before and after two cycles of chemotherapy. The patients with and without periostin response had significant difference in objective response to chemotherapy ( p\u2009=\u20090.001). For the 122 non-small cell lung cancer patients, the median progression-free survival was 5\u2009months. In a multivariate analysis, performance status (hazard ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.67), baseline periostin (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.01), and periostin response (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.29-0.86) were significantly correlated with prognosis. In conclusion, serum periostin was elevated in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients. Baseline periostin and periostin responses appeared to be reliable surrogate markers to predict chemotherapy response and survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background:  During the past decades, the incidence of invasive aspergillosis (IA) caused by  Aspergillus fumigatus  has increased dramatically. The aims of this study were to investigate the susceptibility of clinical isolates of  A. fumigatus  to triazole and the underlying  cyp51A  mutations in triazole-resistant  A. fumigatus .  Methods:  A total of 126  A. fumigatus  clinical isolates from 126 patients with proven or probable IA were obtained from four large tertiary hospitals in Nanjing, China, between August 2012 and July 2015. The determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole was performed by broth microdilution according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing reference method.  Results:  A total of 4  A. fumigatus  isolates (3.17%) were confirmed to be itraconazole resistant, with MICs of \u22658 mg/L, and one isolate (0.8%) was confirmed to be voriconazole resistant and posaconazole resistant, with MICs of 4 mg/L and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. We found that two of the 4 isolates of triazole-resistant  A. fumigatus  had the L98H amino acid substitution in combination with a 34-base pair tandem repeat in the promoter region, one isolate had an M220I mutation, and another itraconazole-resistant isolate did not have a substitution in the  cyp51A  gene.  Conclusions:  This study shows that triazole-resistant  A. fumigatus  clinical isolates are present in Nanjing, China, which is a new challenge to the clinical management of IA.",

        "abstract": "Aspergillus\u00a0fumigatus (A.\u00a0fumigatus) is one of the most common fungal pathogens of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), which may be life threatening in immunocompromised individuals. The dendritic cell-associated C-type lectin receptor (Dectin-1), toll\u2011like receptor (TLR)-2 and TLR-4 are major pattern recognition receptors in alveolar macrophages that recognize A.\u00a0fumigatus components. The PU.1 transcription factor is known to be important for the transcriptional control of these three receptors in mature macrophages. The present study investigated whether alterations of PU.1 expression may affect the innate defense against A.\u00a0fumigatus in the human monocyte THP\u20111 cell line. THP-1-derived macrophages were transduced with PU.1 adenoviral vectors and transfected with PU.1 small interfering RNA, and the mRNA and protein expression levels of Dectin\u20111, TLR\u20112 and TLR\u20114 were measured. In addition, the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2011\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)\u20111\u03b2 were ascertained, and fungal phagocytosis and killing were assessed. The results demonstrated that overexpression of PU.1 by recombinant adenoviral vectors resulted in a significant upregulation of Dectin\u20111, TLR\u20112 and TLR\u20114 at the transcriptional and translational levels. In response to A.\u00a0fumigatus stimulation, PU.1 overexpression increased TNF\u2011\u03b1 and IL\u20111\u03b2 production. In addition, Dectin\u20111, TLR\u20112 and TLR\u20114 upregulation may have enhanced the phagocytosis and killing ability of THP\u20111\u2011derived macrophages. As expected, silencing of PU.1 led to downregulation of Dectin\u20111, TLR\u20112, TLR\u20114 and the expression of pro\u2011inflammatory cytokines, as well as decreased phagocytosis and the killing ability of THP1\u2011derived macrophages. In conclusion, the results indicate that PU.1 may be a critical factor for the innate defense against A.\u00a0fumigatus, and may therefore be a potential target for the prophylaxis and treatment of IPA.",

        "abstract": "Subunit 1 is the scaffold protein of the carbon catabolite repressor protein 4 (CCR4)\u2011negative on TATA (NOT) complex (CNOT1). In our previous study, it was reported that tristetraprolin (TTP) could recruit subunit 7 of the CCR4\u2011NOT complex (CNOT7) to induce the degradation of intercellular adhesion molecule\u20111 (ICAM\u20111) and interleukin\u20118 (IL\u20118) mRNA in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs). It was additionally demonstrated that TTP, CNOT7 and CNOT1 formed a complex in HPMECs. However, whether CNOT1 is involved in TTP\u2011mediated ICAM\u20111 and IL\u20118 mRNA decay remains unclear. The present study demonstrated that CNOT1 knockdown improved ICAM\u20111 and IL\u20118 mRNA stabilization and protein expression levels. The immunofluorescence results demonstrated that CNOT1, CNOT7 and TTP are co\u2011localized in the cytoplasm. CNOT1 silencing abolished CNOT7 and TTP coimmunoprecipitation. However, CNOT7 silencing did not influence CNOT1 and TTP coimmunoprecipitation, and TTP silencing additionally did not influence CNOT1 and CNOT7 coimmunoprecipitation. These results together with the authors' previous study, have identified that CNOT1 provides a platform for the recruitment of TTP and CNOT7, and is involved in TTP\u2011mediated ICAM\u20111 and IL\u20118 mRNA decay.",

        "abstract": "Tristetraprolin (TTP), a substrate of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2), is an RNA-binding protein that binds to AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of its target mRNAs and accelerates mRNA degradation. A previous study by our group showed that MK2 regulates tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1)-induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in human lung microvascular endothelial cells; however, the downstream protein of MK2 remains unknown. Interestingly, both ICAM-1 and IL-8 have AREs in the 3'-UTR of their mRNAs. In the present study, we performed experiments to determine whether MK2 regulates TNF-\u03b1-induced expression of ICAM-1 and IL-8 via TTP in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs). The study revealed that MK2 silencing significantly reduced the half-lives of ICAM-1 and IL-8 mRNAs in TNF-\u03b1-stimulated HPMECs. TTP phosphorylation levels were decreased in MK2-silenced cells. TTP silencing led to mRNA stabilization of ICAM-1 and IL-8 and upregulation of protein production following TNF-\u03b1 stimulation. These results, together with our previous study and others, suggest that MK2, in HPMECs, regulates TNF-\u03b1-induced expression of ICAM-1 and IL-8 via TTP at the mRNA decay level.",

XDR-GNB mainly occur in Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The prevalence of XDR-GNB is on the rise either in China and other countries, posing a major public health threat due to the lack of adequate therapeutic options. A group of Chinese clinical experts, microbiologists and pharmacologists came together to discuss and draft a consensus on the laboratory diagnosis, clinical management and infection control of XDR-GNB infections. Lists of antimicrobial categories proposed for antimicrobial susceptibility testing are created according to documents from the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Multiple risk factors of XDR-GNB infections are analyzed with long-term exposure to extended-spectrum antimicrobials being the most important one. Combination therapeutic regimens are summarized for treatment of XDR-GNB infections caused by different bacteria based on limited clinical studies and/or laboratory data. Most frequently used antimicrobials used for the combination therapies include aminoglycosides, carbapenems, colistin, fosfomycin and tigecycline. Strict infection control measures including hand hygiene, contact isolation, active screening, environmental surface disinfections, decolonization and restrict antibiotic stewardship are recommended to curb the XDR-GNB spread.",

        "abstract": "Aims: To explore the expression of miR-24-3p in human arteries with arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) as well as the role of miR-24-3p in the pathogenesis of ASO. Methods: We used quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and in situ hybridization to monitor miR-24-3p expression in human arteries. To investigate the effect of miR-24-3p on human arterial smooth muscle cells (HASMCs), we applied cell counting and EdU assays to monitor proliferation and transwell and wound healing assays to investigate migration and flow cytometry to investigate apoptosis. Furthermore, we applied 3u0027-untranslated region (3u0027-UTR) luciferase assays to investigate the role of miR-24-3p in targeting platelet-derived growth factor receptor B (PDGFRB) and c-Myc. Results: MiR-24-3p was mainly located in the media of arteries and was downregulated in ASO arteries compared with normal arteries. Platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) treatment reduced the expression of miR-24-3p in primary cultured HASMCs. MiR-24-3p mimic oligos inhibited the proliferation and migration, and promotes apoptosis of HASMCs. Our 3u0027-UTR luciferase assays confirmed that PDGFRB and c-Myc were targets of miR-24-3p. Conclusion: The results suggest that miR-24-3p regulates the proliferation and migration of HASMCs by targeting PDGFRB and c-Myc. The PDGF/miR-24-3p/PDGFRB and PDGF/miR-24-3p/c-Myc pathways may play critical roles in the pathogenesis of ASO. These findings highlight the potential for new therapeutic targets for ASO.",

        "abstract": "Background:  Advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who harbor anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) rearrangement are sensitive to an  ALK  inhibitor (crizotinib), but not all  ALK -positive patients benefit equally from crizotinib treatment. We analyze the impact of  TP53  mutations on response to crizotinib in patients with  ALK  rearrangement NSCLC.  Methods:  Sixty-six  ALK  rearrangement NSCLC patients receiving crizotinib were analyzed. 21 cases were detected successfully by the next generation sequencing validation FFPE before crizotinib.  TP53  mutations were evaluated in 8 patients in relation to disease control rate (DCR), objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results:   TP53  mutations were observed in 2 (25.00%), 1 (12.50%), 1 (12.50%) and 4 (50.00%) patients in exons 5, 6, 7 and 8, respectively. The majority of patients were male (75.00%, 6/8), less than 65 years old (62.50%, 5/8) and never smokers (75.00%, 6/8). ORR and DCR for crizotinib in the entire case series were 61.90% and 71.43%, respectively. Statistically significant difference was observed in terms of PFS and OS between  TP53  gene wild group and mutation group patients (P=0.038, P=0.021, respectively).  Conclusions:   TP53  mutations reduce responsiveness to crizotinib and worsen prognosis in  ALK  rearrangement NSCLC patients.",

However, a molecular counterpart, with scalable processability and competitive device performance, is still challenging. Here, we demonstrate that high-quality few-layer dioctylbenzothienobenzothiophene molecular crystals can be grown on graphene or boron nitride substrate via van der Waals epitaxy, with precisely controlled thickness down to monolayer, large-area single crystal, low process temperature and patterning capability. The crystalline layers are atomically smooth and effectively decoupled from the substrate due to weak van der Waals interactions, affording a pristine interface for high-performance organic transistors. As a result, monolayer dioctylbenzothienobenzothiophene molecular crystal field-effect transistors on boron nitride show record-high carrier mobility up to 10\u2009cm(2)\u2009V(-1)\u2009s(-1) and aggressively scaled saturation voltage ~1\u2009V. Our work unveils an exciting new class of two-dimensional molecular materials for electronic and optoelectronic applications.",

        "abstract": "Er doped Si/Al2O3 multilayer films were grown by pulsed laser deposition(PLD)and post annealed by RTA.The room temperature Er-related PL spectra were observed under excitation of the Ar+ 476 nm laser which is not Er3+ resonant pumping.This means that in the films there are indirect excitations to Er3+ luminescence and the nanosilicons produced by RTA must be sensitisers.By analyzing the PL peak intensity at 1.54 \u03bcm as a function of annealing temperature,it is found that the film annealed at 700 \u2103 gets the strongest photoluminescence which is 39 times higher than that of the Er doped Al2O3 reference film produced by the same method.Furthermore,the Raman scattering spectra shows that in the film annealed at 700 \u2103 the silicon is still amorphous,but therein some Si nanoclusters which are effective sentitisers to Er3+ luminescence have already appear.Then,after the films are annealed at temperatures above 700 \u2103,the Si-nanoclusters crystallize increasingly well and meanwhile the sizes of Si-nanocrystals become bigger and bigger leading to the number of effective sensitisers decrease.This phenomenon causes the decline of Er3+ PL intensity.It shows that the optimal annealing temperature is 700 \u2103 which is far below the annealing temperature required for Er-doped samples containing Si-nanocrystal.",

We describe here for the first time a general supramolecular approach toward controlled in situ synthesis of one-dimensional nanostructured conductive hydrogels (polypyrrole (PPy) as a model system) using a rational dopant counterion, which is a disc-shaped liquid crystal molecular copper phthalocyanine-3,4',4\u2033,4\u2034-tetrasulfonic acid tetrasodium salt (CuPcTs). The dopant molecule CuPcTs cross-linked the PPy chains to form a three-dimensional network that gelated into a hydrogel. The PPy hydrogel could be synthesized in bulk quantities with uniform morphology of self-assembled interconnected nanofibers. The tetra-functional dopant favors a supramolecular self-assembly mechanism to form one-dimensional PPy nanostructures. Furthermore, the enhanced interchain charge transport of CuPcTs doped PPy resulted in greatly enhanced conductivity and pseudocapacitance compared with pristine PPy.",

In this paper, we investigate the growth behavior of the GaN film by combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Both of the simulations show that V/III mixture degree can have important impacts on the deposition behavior, and it is found that the more uniform the mixture is, the better the growth is. Besides, by using MD simulations, we illustrate the whole process of the GaN growth. Furthermore, we also find that the V/III ratio can affect the final roughness of the GaN film. When the V/III ratio is high, the surface of final GaN film is smooth. The present study provides insights into GaN growth from the macroscopic and microscopic views, which may provide some suggestions on better experimental GaN preparation.",

        "abstract": "A novel two-step method is employed,for the first time,to fabricate nonvolatile memory devices that have metal nanocrystals.First,size-averaged Au nanocrystals are synthesized chemically;second,they are assembled into memory devices by a spin-coating technique at room temperature.This attractive approach makes it possible to tailor the diameter and control the density of nanocrystals individually.In addition,processes at room temperature prevent Au diffusion,which is a main concern for the application of metal nanocrystal-based memory.The experimental results,both the morphology characterization and the electrical measurements,reveal that there is an optimum density of nanocrystal monolayer to balance between long data retention and a large hysteresis memory window.At the same time,density-controllable devices could also feed the preferential emphasis on either memory window or retention time. All these facts confirm the advantages and novelty of our two-step method.",

The middle medium is 2-amino-4, 5-dicyanoimidazole (AIDCN) film fabricated by vacuum evaporation, and the anode and cathode metals of the device are ITO glass and Al, respectively. The microstructure features of the SnOx nanoparticles, which were formed due to the chemical reaction between the tin oxide in ITO and AIDCN, have been investigated using transition electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS), etc. The tin element at the AIDCN/ITO interface mainly arises from the tin segregation layer near the surface of ITO. It is demonstrated that the interface of ITO and AIDCN is of the crucial importance of the electrical behavior. Through this kind of in-situ reaction at an interface, a cross point memory with on-off ratio over 11 orders are obtained. \u00a92008 Chinese Institute of Electronics.",

        "abstract": "Ferroelectric organic field-effect transistors (Fe-OFETs) have been attractive for a variety of non-volatile memory device applications. One of the critical issues of Fe-OFETs is the improvement of carrier mobility in semiconducting channels. In this article, we propose a novel interfacial buffering method that inserts an ultrathin poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) between ferroelectric polymer and organic semiconductor layers. A high field-effect mobility (\u03bcFET) up to 4.6 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) is obtained. Subsequently, the programming process in our Fe-OFETs is mainly dominated by the switching between two ferroelectric polarizations rather than by the mobility-determined charge accumulation at the channel. Thus, the &amp;quot;reading&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;programming&amp;quot; speeds are significantly improved. Investigations show that the polarization fluctuation at semiconductor/insulator interfaces, which affect the charge transport in conducting channels, can be suppressed effectively using our method.",

At the temperature under 400 \u2103, the oxidation of InN film is difficult, but the oxidation of metal In is very easy. Thus, the oxidation of In is the main process during oxidation of the In-rich InN film under the temperature less than 400 \u2103. As the annealing temperature is higher than 400 \u2103, metal In and InN are oxidated meanwhile. Although oxidation under the temperature high than 400 \u2103, InN is apparently oxidated very slowly. This may be due to the decomposition of InN. The oxidation rate under the ambience of wet oxygen is larger than that under dry oxygen.",

Carbon content in the film increases and the lattice constant of the epilayer decreases with increase of the substrate temperature and C2H4 partial pressure. It demonstrates that the incorporated C atoms mainly occupy the substitutional sites. The bandgap of the film can be effectively adjusted by varying the C content, while the quality of the film can be improved by increasing the substrate temperature. The Ge graded Si1-x-yGexCy film consists of the Si1-x-yGexCy layer and Si1-xGex layer. The former is due to the reaction between GeH4, C2H4 and Si atoms diffusing from the substrate to surface, and the latter is the result of Ge diffusing from the Si1-x-yGexCy epilayer to the substrate.",

The unique band structure of graphene necessitates engineering of the Dirac point, including the opening of the bandgap, the doping and the interface, before the graphene can be used in logic applications. On the other hand, MoS2 is a semiconductor, and its electron transport depends heavily on the surface properties, the number of layers, and the carrier density. Finally, we discuss the prospects for the future developments in 2D material transistors.",

High density self-assembled Ge-dots/a-Si multilayered structures are first deposited on SiO2/Si (100) substrates using low-pressure chemical vapor deposition, and then a-Si layers are crystallized by low-temperature (below 550\u00b0C) Ni-based metal-induced lateral crystallization. Optical micrograph, electron microscopy, and micro-Raman spectroscopy observations show that the lateral crystallization Si regions have large leaf-like grains (about 4-5 \u03bcm in diameter) elongated along the metal-induced lateral crystallization direction with (110) preference. The strain shift of Ge dots reveals the formation of a high quality interface between the crystallized Si and Ge dots.",

        "abstract": "Molybdenum disulfide is considered as one of the most promising two-dimensional semiconductors for electronic and optoelectronic device applications. So far, the charge transport in monolayer molybdenum disulfide is dominated by extrinsic factors such as charged impurities, structural defects and traps, leading to much lower mobility than the intrinsic limit. Here we develop a facile low-temperature thiol chemistry route to repair the sulfur vacancies and improve the interface, resulting in significant reduction of the charged impurities and traps. High mobility >80\u2009cm(2)\u2009V(-1)\u2009s(-1) is achieved in backgated monolayer molybdenum disulfide field-effect transistors at room temperature. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical model to quantitatively extract the key microscopic quantities that control the transistor performances, including the density of charged impurities, short-range defects and traps. Our combined experimental and theoretical study provides a clear path towards intrinsic charge transport in two-dimensional dichalcogenides for future high-performance device applications.",

        "abstract": "We report the fabrication and characterization of light-emitting diodes based on n-ZnO/p-GaN heterojunctions.The n-type ZnO epilayer is deposited by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on a MOCVD grown Mg-doped p-GaN layer to form a p-n heterojunction.During the etching process, the relation between the etching depth and the etching time is linear in a HF and NH_4Cl solution of a certain ratio.The etching rates of the SiO_2 and ZnO are well controlled,which are essential for device fabrication.The current-voltage relationship of this heterojunction shows a diode-like rectifying behavior.In contrast to previous reports,electroluminescence (EL) emissions are observed by the naked eye at room temperature from the n-ZnO/p-GaN heterojunction under forward-and reverse-bias.The origins of these EL emissions are discussed in comparison with the photoluminescence spectra.",

        "title": "The enhancement of light-emitting efficiency using GaN-based multiple quantum well light-emitting diodes with nanopillar arrays",
        "abstract": "The quest for higher modulation speed and lower energy consumption has inevitably promoted the rapid development of semiconductor-based solid lighting devices in recent years. GaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have emerged as promising candidates for achieving high efficiency and high intensity, and have received increasing attention among many researchers in this field. In this paper, we use a self-assembled array-patterned mask to fabricate InGaN/GaN multi-quantum well (MQW) LEDs with the intention of enhancing the light-emitting efficiency. By utilizing inductively coupled plasma etching with a self-assembled Ni cluster as the mask, nanopillar arrays are formed on the surface of the InGaN/GaN MQWs. We then observe the structure of the nanopillars and find that the V-defects on the surface of the conventional structure and the negative effects of threading dislocation are effectively reduced. Simultaneously, we make a comparison of the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum between the conventional structure and the nanopillar arrays, achieved under an experimental set-up with an excitation wavelength of 325 mm. The analysis demonstrates that MQW-LEDs with nanopillar arrays achieve a PL intensity 2.7 times that of conventional LEDs. In response to the PL spectrum, some reasons are proposed for the enhancement in the light-emitting efficiency as follows: 1) the improvement in crystal quality, namely the reduction in V-defects; 2) the roughened surface effect on the expansion of the critical angle and the attenuated total reflection; and 3) the enhancement of the light-extraction efficiency due to forward scattering by surface plasmon polariton modes in Ni particles deposited above the p-type GaN layer at the top of the nanopillars.",

Thanks to the presence of energetic Er species produced by pulsed laser deposition, a shallow implantation of Er atoms into Si layers is achieved during the deposition process. The doped Er atoms induce additional strains in the amorphous Si layers and serve as nucleation centers to induce the formation of Si nanocrystals at low annealing temperatures. When Si nanocrystals are introduced as sensitizers, the photoluminescence of Er 3+ in Al 2O 3 is greatly enhanced. The optimized photoluminescence is achieved at annealing temperature of 600\u00b0C, where a high density of small Si nanocrystals and a good local environment of Er 3+ are crucial, then the photoluminescence gradually decreases as the annealing temperature increases.",

However, a major challenge remains in developing scalable methodologies that enable superhydrophobic coatings on versatile substrates with a combination of strong mechanical stability, optical transparency, and even stretchability. Herein, we developed a scalable methodology to versatile hydrophobic surfaces that combine with strong mechanical stability, optical transparency, and stretchability by using a self-assembled hydrogel as the template to in situ generate silica microstructures and subsequent silanization. The superhydrophobic coatings can be enabled on virtually any substrates via large-area deposition techniques like dip coating. Transparent surfaces with optical transmittance as high as 98% were obtained. Moreover, the coatings exhibit superior mechanical flexibility and robustness that it can sustain contact angles \u223c 160\u00b0 even after 5000 cycles of mechanically stretching at 100% strain. The multifunctional surfaces can be used as screen filters and sponges for the oil/water separation that can selectively absorb oils up to 40\u00d7 their weight.",

Solution-processed organic crystals are appreciable materials for these applications because they facilitate large-scale, low-cost fabrication of devices with high performance. Patterning organic crystal transistors into well-defined geometric features is necessary to develop these crystals into practical semiconductors. This review provides an update on recentdevelopment in patterning technology for solution-processed organic crystals and their applications in field-effect transistors. Typical demonstrations are discussed and examined. In particular, our latest research progress on the spin-coating technique from mixture solutions is presented as a promising method to efficiently produce large organic semiconducting crystals on various substrates for high-performance OFETs. This solution-based process also has other excellent advantages, such as phase separation for self-assembled interfaces via one-step spin-coating, self-flattening of rough interfaces, and  purification that eliminates the impurity influences. Furthermore, recommendations for future perspectives are presented, and key issues for further development are discussed.",

        "abstract": "One of the basic assumptions in organic field-effect transistors, the most fundamental device unit in organic electronics, is that charge transport occurs two dimensionally in the first few molecular layers near the dielectric interface. Although the mobility of bulk organic semiconductors has increased dramatically, direct probing of intrinsic charge transport in the two-dimensional limit has not been possible due to excessive disorders and traps in ultrathin organic thin films. Here, highly ordered single-crystalline mono- to tetralayer pentacene crystals are realized by van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy on hexagonal BN. We find that the charge transport is dominated by hopping in the first conductive layer, but transforms to bandlike in subsequent layers. Such an abrupt phase transition is attributed to strong modulation of the molecular packing by interfacial vdW interactions, as corroborated by quantitative structural characterization and density functional theory calculations. The structural modulation becomes negligible beyond the second conductive layer, leading to a mobility saturation thickness of only \u223c3\u2009\u2009nm. Highly ordered organic ultrathin films provide a platform for new physics and device structures (such as heterostructures and quantum wells) that are not possible in conventional bulk crystals.",

        "abstract": "Organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) with high mobility and low contact resistance have been actively pursued as building blocks for low-cost organic electronics. In conventional solution-processed or vacuum-deposited OTFTs, due to interfacial defects and traps, the organic film has to reach a certain thickness for efficient charge transport. Using an ultimate monolayer of 2,7-dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene (C8-BTBT) molecules as an OTFT channel, we demonstrate remarkable electrical characteristics, including intrinsic hole mobility over 30 cm2/Vs, Ohmic contact with 100 \u03a9 \u00b7 cm resistance, and band-like transport down to 150 K. Compared to conventional OTFTs, the main advantage of a monolayer channel is the direct, nondisruptive contact between the charge transport layer and metal leads, a feature that is vital for achieving low contact resistance and current saturation voltage. On the other hand, bilayer and thicker C8-BTBT OTFTs exhibit strong Schottky contact and much higher contact resistance but can be improved by inserting a doped graphene buffer layer. Our results suggest that highly crystalline molecular monolayers are promising form factors to build high-performance OTFTs and investigate device physics. They also allow us to precisely model how the molecular packing changes the transport and contact properties.",

Here, we report the organic monolayers with large-area uniformity and high crystallinity deposited by an antisolvent-assisted spin-coating method, acting as the templating layers between the dielectric and thermally evaporated semiconducting layers. The predeposited crystalline monolayers significantly enhance the film crystallinity of upper layers and the overall performance of transistors using these hybrid-deposited semiconducting films, showing a high carrier mobility up to 11.3 cm2 V-1 s-1. Additionally, patterned transistor arrays composed of the templating monolayers are fabricated, yielding an average mobility of 7.7 cm2 V-1 s-1. This work demonstrates a promising method to fabricate low-cost, high-performance, and large-area organic electronics.",

Interface engineering on the semiconductor/dielectric interface is an effective approach for improving device performance, particularly for enhancing charge transport at conducting channels. Here, we report flat-lying molecular monolayers that exhibit good uniformity and high crystallinity at the semiconductor/dielectric interface deposited through slow thermal evaporation. Transistor devices achieve high carrier mobility of up to 2.80 cm2 V-1 s-1, which indicates a remarkably improved device performance compared with devices that are completely based on fast-evaporated films. Interfacial flat-lying monolayers benefit charge transport by suppressing the polarization of dipoles and narrowing the widening of trap density of states. Therefore, our work provides a promising strategy for enhancing the performance of OFETs by using interfacial flat-lying molecular monolayers.",

        "abstract": "Ferroelectric organic field-effect transistors (Fe-OFETs) have attracted intensive attention because of their promising potential in nonvolatile memory devices. The quick switching between binary states is a significant fundamental feature in evaluating Fe-OFET memories. Here, we employ 2D molecular crystals via a solution-based process as the conducting channels in transistor devices, in which ferroelectric polymer acts as the gate dielectric. A high carrier mobility of up to 5.6 cm V s and a high on/off ratio of 10 are obtained. In addition, the efficient charge injection by virtue of the ultrathin 2D molecular crystals is beneficial in achieving rapid operations in the Fe-OFETs; devices exhibit short switching time of \u223c2.9 and \u223c3.0 ms from the on- to the off-state and from the off- to the on-state, respectively. Consequently, the presented strategy is capable of speeding up Fe-OFET memory devices by using solution-processed 2D molecular crystals.",

        "abstract": "The newly emerging field in organic electronics is to control the molecule-substrate interface properties at a two-dimensional (2D) limit via interfacial interactions, which paves the way for driving the molecular assembly for highly ordered 2D molecular crystalline films with precise molecular layers and large-area uniformity. Here, by exploiting molecule-substrate van der Waals (vdW) interactions, we demonstrate thermally induced self-assembly of 2D organic crystalline films exhibiting well-defined molecular layer number over a millimeter-sized area. The organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) with bilayer films show excellent electrical performance with a maximum mobility of 12.8 cm2 V-1 s-1. Moreover, we find that the monolayer films can act as interfacial molecular templates to construct heterojunctions with well-balanced ambipolar transport behaviors. The capability of thermally induced self-assembly of 2D molecular crystalline films with controllable molecular layers and scale-up coverage opens up a way for realizing complicated electronic applications, such as lateral heterojunctions and superlattices. It also provides an ideal platform for unveiling a universal understanding towards the nature of molecular assembly and organization motion in organic materials.",

        "abstract": "The wetting of a droplet on a particular solid surface of a thin liquid film followed by solvent drying is a crucial process for nanostructure formation. However, this thin liquid film was commonly observed to rupture due to the instability of the given surface. Herein, we developed a technique to control the dynamical kinetics of a solution droplet by the co-solvent vapor, which yielded a reversible spreading/dewetting process between the spherical droplet and the stable thin liquid layer on surfaces that are usually difficult to wet. Our theoretical model indicates that the wetting process is governed by the sorption of co-solvent vapor within the droplet, which alters the surface free energy, lowers the contact angle, reduces the liquid film thickness, and stabilizes the drying process. The obtained thin liquid films allow the in-plane alignment to generate one-dimensional nano- or micro-structures in the deposited materials, such as nanowires and organic crystals. In particular, in-plane aligned organic single crystals unveiled high field-effect mobility, up to 9.1 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121, in thin-film transistors.",

High-performance top-gate Fe-FET memories using ferroelectric polymers of poly(vinylidene fluoride\u2013trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF\u2013TrFE)) and the inorganic oxide of InSiO were fabricated. The extracted electron mobility was as high as 84.1 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 in a low-frequency state. The interfacial charge transfer between the P(VDF\u2013TrFE) and InSiO during annealing of the P(VDF\u2013TrFE) layer benefits improvement in the device performance.

        "abstract": "Ferroelectric organic field-effect transistors (Fe-OFETs) have attracted considerable attention because of their promising potential for memory applications, while a critical issue is the large energy consumption as mainly caused by a high operating voltage and slow data switching. Here, we employ ultrathin ferroelectric polymer and semiconducting molecular crystals to create low-voltage Fe-OFET memories. Devices only require a pJ-level energy consumption. The writing and erasing processes require ~1.2 and 1.6 pJ/bit, respectively, and the reading energy is ~1.9 pJ/bit (on state) and ~0.2 fJ/bit (off state). Thus, our memories only consume < 0.1% of the energy required for devices using bulk functional layers. Besides, our devices also exhibit low contact resistance and steep subthreshold swing. Therefore, we provide a strategy that opens up a path for Fe-OFETs towards emerging applications, such as wearable electronics.",

Soluble organic semiconductors can be used to achieve low-cost and high-throughput manufacturing of electronic devices. However, achieving solution-processed 2D single-crystalline semiconductors with uniform morphology remains a substantial challenge. Here, the fabrication of 2D molecular single-crystal semiconductors with precise layer definition by using a floating-coffee-ring-driven assembly is presented. In particular, bilayer molecular films exhibit single-crystalline features with atomic smoothness and high film uniformity over a large area; field-effect transistors yield average and maximum carrier mobilities of 4.8 and 13.0 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121, respectively. This work demonstrates the strong potential of 2D molecular crystals for low-cost, large-area, and high-performance electronics.",

        "abstract": "The polymer poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF\u2013TrFE)) is highly desirable for piezoelectric and ferroelectric functional applications owing to its considerable electromechanical activity and reliable electrical polarization. However, a clear understanding of the effect of the thermal annealing on the electromechanical behavior and polarization nature of ultrathin crystalline P(VDF\u2013TrFE) films is severely lacking. Here we report the thermally induced structural reorganization, and piezo- and ferroelectric features in the ultrathin P(VDF\u2013TrFE) films. On applying a 40 \u00b0C annealing treatment, the polarization-patterned electrostrictive strain reaches the highest value of \u223c53.7 pm. Besides, the ultrathin film exhibits a highly ordered antiparallel dipole alignment, the highest local piezoelectric activity, and an improved polarization relaxation time. The optimum film properties are achieved owing to a high degree of polymer chains oriented parallel to the substrate plane. Our results can reveal a promising avenue for nano-electro-mechanical and nano-ferroelectric electronic applications using ultrathin P(VDF\u2013TrFE) films.",

        "abstract": "Van der Waals (vdW) heterojunctions based on two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals have been extensively studied in recent years. Herein, we show that both vertical and lateral vdW heterojunctions can be realized with layered molecular crystals using a two-step physical vapor transport (PVT) process. Both types of heterojunctions show clean and sharp interfaces without phase mixing under atomic force microscopy (AFM). They also exhibit a strong interfacial built-in electric field similar to that of their inorganic counterparts. These heterojunctions have greater potential for device applications than individual materials. The lateral heterojunction (LHJ) devices show rectifying characteristics due to the asymmetric energy barrier for holes at the interface, while the vertical heterojunction (VHJ) devices behave like metal\u2013insulator\u2013semiconductor tunnel junctions, with pronounced negative differential conductance (NDC). Our work extends the concept of vdW heterojunctions to molecular materials, which can be generalized to other layered organic semiconductors (OSCs) to obtain new device functionalities.",

However, the nature of charge transport in back-gated devices still remains elusive as they show much lower mobility than theoretical calculations and native n-type doping. Here we report a study of transport in few-layer molybdenum disulphide, together with transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory. We provide direct evidence that sulphur vacancies exist in molybdenum disulphide, introducing localized donor states inside the bandgap. Under low carrier densities, the transport exhibits nearest-neighbour hopping at high temperatures and variable-range hopping at low temperatures, which can be well explained under Mott formalism. We suggest that the low-carrier-density transport is dominated by hopping via these localized gap states. Our study reveals the important role of short-range surface defects in tailoring the properties and device applications of molybdenum disulphide.",

Here we report a nano-plasmonic study of vdW heterostructures that were produced by depositing ordered molecular layers of pentacene on top of graphene. We find through nano-infrared (IR) imaging that surface plasmons formed due to the collective oscillations of Dirac fermions in graphene are highly sensitive to the adjacent pentacene layers. In particular, the plasmon wavelength declines systematically but nonlinearly with increasing pentacene thickness. Further analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the observed peculiar thickness dependence is mainly due to the tunneling-type electron transfer from pentacene to graphene. Our work unveils a new method for tailoring graphene plasmons and deepens our understanding of the intriguing nano-optical phenomena due to interlayer couplings in novel vdW heterostructures.",

So far, however, all TMDCs show much lower mobility experimentally because of the collective effects by foreign impurities, which has become one of the most important limitations for their device applications. Here, taking MoS2 as an example, the key factors that bring down the mobility in TMDC transistors, including phonons, charged impurities, defects, and charge traps, are reviewed. A theoretical model that quantitatively captures the scaling of mobility with temperature, carrier density, and thickness is introduced. By fitting the available mobility data from literature over the past few years, one obtains the density of impurities and traps for a wide range of transistor structures. It shows that interface engineering can effectively reduce the impurities, leading to improved device performances. For few-layer TMDCs, the lopsided carrier distribution is analytically modeled to elucidate the experimental increase of mobility with the number of layers. From our analysis, it is clear that the charge transport in TMDC samples is a very complex problem that must be handled carefully.",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional layered materials (2DLMs) are of considerable interest for high-performance electronic devices for their unique electronic properties and atomically thin geometry. However, the atomically thin geometry makes their electronic properties highly susceptible to the environment changes. In particular, some 2DLMs (e.g., black phosphorus (BP) and SnSe2) are unstable and could rapidly degrade over time when exposed to ambient conditions. Therefore, the development of proper passivation schemes that can preserve the intrinsic properties and enhance their lifetime represents a key challenge for these atomically thin electronic materials. Herein we introduce a simple, non-disruptive and scalable van der Waals passivation approach by using organic thin films to simultaneously improve the performance and air stability of BP field-effect transistors (FETs). We show that dioctylbenzothienobenzothiophene (C8-BTBT) thin films can be readily deposited on BP via van der Waals epitaxy approach to protect BP against oxidation in ambient conditions over 20 days. Importantly, the non-covalent van der Waals interface between C8-BTBT and BP effectively preserves the intrinsic properties of BP, allowing us to demonstrate high-performance BP FETs with a record-high current density of 920 \u00b5A/um, hole drift velocity over 1\u2179107 cm/s, and on/off ratio of 104~107 at room temperature. This approach is generally applicable to other unstable two-dimensional (2D) materials, defining a unique pathway to modulate their electronic properties and realize high-performance devices through hybrid heterojunctions.",

Here we study biaxial compressive strain in graphene/hexagonal boron nitride heterostructures after thermal cycling to high temperatures likely due to their thermal expansion coefficient mismatch. The appearance of sub-micron self-supporting bubbles indicates that the strain is spatially inhomogeneous. Finite element modeling suggests that the strain is concentrated on the edges with regular nano-scale wrinkles, which could be a playground for strain engineering in graphene. Raman spectroscopy and mapping is employed to quantitatively probe the magnitude and distribution of strain. From the temperature-dependent shifts of Raman G and 2D peaks, we estimate the TEC of graphene from room temperature to above 1000K for the first time.",

It has been extensively studied in the past few decades due to its applications in logic and memory devices. Here, we observe unique antibipolar transfer characteristics and NTC behavior in multi-layer 2,6-diphenyl anthracene organic thin-film transistors grown on h-BN, which is due to the vertical potential barrier between the charge accumulation region near the substrate and the neutral bulk region under the contacts. The applied extrinsic electric field could effectively modulate the barrier height, resulting in a competition for charge carrier transport between lateral and vertical directions. Based on the NTC and antibipolar properties, a frequency doubler has been fabricated on a single transistor, which provides a new building block for organic logic circuits.",

In this work, the authors report a new hybrid structure that marries CsPbX IPQDs to silicon nanowires (SiNWs) radial junction structures to achieve ultrafast and highly sensitive ultraviolet (UV) detection in solar-blind spectrum. A compact and uniform deployment of CsPbX IPQDs upon the sidewall of low-reflective 3D radial junctions enables a strong light field excitation and efficient down-conversion of the ultraviolet incidences, which are directly tailored into emission bands optimized for a rapid photodetection in surrounding ultrathin radial p-i-n junctions. A fast solar-blind UV detection has been demonstrated in this hybrid IPQD-NW detectors, with rise/fall response time scales of 0.48/1.03 ms and a high responsivity of 54 mA W @200 nm (or 32 mA W @270 nm), without the need of any external power supply. These results pave the way toward large area manufacturing of high performance Si-based perovskite UV detectors in a scalable and low-cost procedure.",

        "abstract": "High mobility, scalable and even transparent thin-film transistors (TFTs) are always being pursued in the field of large area electronics. While excimer laser-beam-scanning can crystallize amorphous Si (a-Si) into high mobility poly-Si, it is limited to small areas. We here demonstrate a robust nano-droplet-scanning strategy that converts an a-Si:H thin film directly into periodic poly-Si nano-channels, with the aid of well-coordinated indium droplets. This enables the robust batch-fabrication of high performance Fin-TFTs with a high hole mobility of >100 cm V s and an excellent subthreshold swing of only 163 mV dec, via a low temperature <350 \u00b0C thin film process. More importantly, precise integration of tiny poly-Si channels, measuring only 60 nm in diameter and 2 \u03bcm apart on glass substrates, provides an unprecedented transparent Si-based TFT technology to visible light, which is widely sought for the next generation of high aperture displays and fully transparent electronics. The successful implementation of such a reliable nano-droplet-scanning strategy, rooted in the strength of nanoscale growth dynamics, will enable eventually the batch-manufacturing and upgrade of high performance large area electronics in general, and high definition and scalable flat-panel displays in particular.",

Especially, it has intriguing potential in photo detectors and great advantages in mid infrared field. Yet, its optoelectronic modulation is open to be elucidated, which requires a fundamental understanding of its field effect optical modulation. Here, we reported the measurements of the lower-energy infrared anisotropic optical response of thin black arsenic phosphorus under different electrical gating. We reveal that in addition to band edge absorption, amplitude modulation of sub-band absorption up to ten percent is also obtained in reflection extinction. These in-gap absorptions are attributed to spin-orbital coupling and free carrier absorption. Our results suggest the important potential for use of black arsenic phosphorus in mid-infrared optoelectronic modulator applications.",

This has been achieved mainly by alternating the feeding precursors during a uniaxial growth of Ge/Si NWs. In this work, a self-automated growth of Ge/Si hetero island-chain nanowires (hiNWs), consisting of wider c-Ge islands connected by thinner c-Si chains, has been accomplished via an indium (In) droplet mediated transformation of uniform amorphous a-Si/a-Ge bilayer thin films. The surface-running In droplet enforces a circulative hydrodynamics in the nanoscale droplet, which can modulate the absorption depth into the amorphous bilayer and enable a single-run growth of a superlattice-like hiNWs, without the needs for any external manipulation. Meanwhile, the separation and accumulation of electrons and holes in the phase-modulated Ge/Si superlattice leads to a modulated surface potential profile that can be directly resolved by Kelvin probe force microscopy. This simple self-assembly growth and modulation dynamics can help to establish a powerful new concept or strategy to tailor and program the geometric and compositional profiles of more complex hetero nanowire structures, as promising building blocks to develop advanced nanoelectronics or optoelectronics.",

More interestingly, a unique twin-reflected interlaced crystal-domain structure has been identified for the first time, while in situ and real-time scanning electron microscopy observations reveal a new twin-triggering growth mechanism that is the key to reset a complete zigzag growth cycle. Direct \u201cstress\u2013strain\u201d testing of the SiNW springs demonstrates a large stretchability of 12% under tensile loading, indicating a whole new strategy and capability to engineer mono-like SiNW channels for high performance stretchable electronics.",

Here, we report a novel nanoscale SoS heteroepitaxial growth that resembles the in-plane writing of self-aligned silicon nanowires (SiNWs) on R-plane sapphire. During a low-temperature growth at  900 \u00b0C, the bottom heterointerface cultivates crystalline Si pyramid seeds within the catalyst droplet, while the vertical SiNW/catalyst interface subsequently threads the seeds into continuous nanowires, producing self-oriented in-plane SiNWs that follow a set of crystallographic directions of the sapphire substrate. Despite the low-temperature fabrication process, the field effect transistors built on the SoS-SiNWs demonstrate a high on/off ratio of u003e5 \u00d7 104 and a peak hole mobility of u003e50 cm2/V\u00b7s.

        "abstract": "Evolutionary process of a nanoscale FinFET channel during rapid hydrogen thermal treatment is modeled using a kinetic Monte Carlo simulation. In this paper, a novel model of nanoscale FinFET channel is proposed based on the surface diffusion theory of silicon fin structures. The evolution characteristics of fin surface morphology, including line edge roughness (LER), line width roughness, and the cross-correlation coefficient \u03c1, are investigated in the diffusion process of silicon fin structures at different temperatures and time. All the characteristic parameters can directly affect the carrier transport performance of FinFET. The LER of a silicon fin has been effectively reduced by at least 60%. The linewidth roughness and \u03c1 was also investigated in the evolution of FinFET channel. The results indicate that an optimized nanoscale FinFET channel can be achieved by controlling the migration of surface silicon atoms in rapid hydrogen thermal treatment technology application, yielding atomically smooth sidewall surfaces. The present experimental results are coincided with the simulation results. Thus, such technology plays a crucial role in the application of nanoscale FinFET.",

However, flexible pressure sensors tend to have disadvantages of slow response speed and large hysteresis, which are caused mainly by the viscoelasticity and interfacial adhesion of flexible materials. In this letter, we adopted silicon nanowire (SiNW) arrays to fabricate a pressure sensor with a piezo-capacitance when the SiNWs are bending under pressure, which avoided the viscoelasticity and interfacial adhesion accompanying with common flexible materials. The sensor recorded unprecedented low hysteresis (~2.26%) and an extremely short response time (~3 ms). With high sensitivity (up to ~8.2 kPa \u22121 ), large response capacitance, ultralow detection limit (0.1 Pa), and good repeatability and stability, the sensor holds potential applications in advanced electronic skins, especially when high-precision and high-speed sensing are required.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Flexibility and power-to-weight (PTW) ratio are the key factors for promoting wearable or portable solar cell applications. Planar hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin films deposited directly on soft aluminum foils (AF) are usually subject to easy cracking and delamination due to the mechanical instability on AF surface. Here, an exceptionally robust three-dimensional (3D) construction of a-Si:H radial p-i-n junction solar cells on soft supermarket-available AF of 15\u202f\u00b5m thick is reported, where the discrete and firmly standing Si nanowire (SiNW) cores, grown and rooted on the soft AF surface, frame up a 3D architecture that protects the protrusive photo-active radial junctions from the unstable a-Si/Al bottom layer. An excellent flexibility and integrity of the 3D a-Si:H radial junctions have been achieved, even under bending to radius of 5\u202fmm. Remarkably, without any diffusion barrier protection, a power conversion efficiency of 5.6% has been recorded, with an open-circuit voltage of 0.71\u202fV and photo-current density of 14.2\u202fmA/cm 2 , leading to a high PTW ratio of u003e\u202f1300\u202fW/kg. Importantly, the overall fabrication cost can be largely slashed off, by ~46% compared to conventional a-Si:H solar cells, as the need for a bottom TCO contact/texturing layer, for a back-reflection coating and for a glass/polymer substrate are all exempted.",

Here, a novel radial tandem junction (RTJ) super-rod structure is proposed and demonstrated, which consists of coaxially stacking hydrogenated amorphous silicon PIN junctions upon silicon nanowires, resembling to the live retinal cells in terms of both geometry and dimension. As a consequence, these RTJ units enjoy a unique wavelength-selective and cavity-mode-assisted light absorption/responses in the inner and the outer radial PIN junctions, which are readily tunable to achieve natural RGB color discrimination in the RTJ rod-cells without the need of any filter system. This unique RTJ design can indicate a new 3D implementation of color sensing photodetectors enabled by advanced nanophotonic structuring and engineering.",

        "abstract": "We propose a deep-groove thin-film active antenna for Si-based hot-electron photodetectors. Simulation results show that near-perfect absorption is achieved when the incidence light is strongly confined within the grooves at cavity resonance modes. Meanwhile, superior internal quantum efficiency is expected due to that the generated hot electrons can be effectively extracted by emitting over the designed multi Schottky barriers, especially at the bottom region of the grooves. By using a rigorous calculation method based on the specific absorption spatial distribution, it is found that higher photoresponsivity can be obtained by tailoring the groove depth and metal thickness to make sure more hot electrons are generated at the bottom region of the grooves. The optimized device exhibits an unbiased responsivity of ~12 mA/W at 1550 nm, which suggests a promising candidate for infrared Si-based photodetection.",

The SBE antenna exhibits far greater transmission enhancement than bull\u2019s eye antenna, especially at mid-infrared wavelengths, substantially due to the change in transmission mode from evanescent to propagating and also the induced Fabry\u2013Perot resonances in the central slit.

While all these mixed-cation PSCs were synthesized via a solution method, we here propose and demonstrate a precisely tunable stack sequence physical-chemical vapor deposition (SS-PCVD) approach to prepare a mixed-cation absorber in CsBr-doped hybrid organic perovskite, which features a beneficial gradient bandgap profile to enable an improvement of PCE from 11.69% in pure FAPbI3 to 18.22% in mixed-cation PSCs. Remarkably, an excellent stability in ambient exposure for 60 days has been achieved by a proper control of the CsBr cation incorporation and interface passivation. This new approach indicates a simple, precisely tunable and low cost fabrication strategy to implement high performance and scalable mixed-cation halide perovskite solar cells.",

        "abstract": "Seeking high-capacity, high-rate, and durable anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has been a crucial aspect to promote the use of electric vehicles and other portable electronics. Here, a novel alloy-forming approach to convert amorphous Si (a-Si)-coated copper oxide (CuO) core\u2013shell nanowires (NWs) into hollow and highly interconnected Si\u2013Cu alloy (mixture) nanotubes is reported. Upon a simple H2 annealing, the CuO cores are reduced and diffused out to alloy with the a-Si shell, producing highly interconnected hollow Si\u2013Cu alloy nanotubes, which can serve as high-capacity and self-conductive anode structures with robust mechanical support. A high specific capacity of 1010 mAh g\u22121 (or 780 mAh g\u22121) has been achieved after 1000 cycles at 3.4 A g\u22121 (or 20 A g\u22121), with a capacity retention rate of \u224884% (\u224888%), without the use of any binder or conductive agent. Remarkably, they can survive an extremely fast charging rate at 70 A g\u22121 for 35 runs (corresponding to one full cycle in 30 s) and recover 88% capacity. This novel alloy-nanotube structure could represent an ideal candidate to fulfill the true potential of Si-loaded LIB applications.",

In this work, we develop a well-controlled lower temperature ( 0.1 cm2) without external power supply. Remarkably, the perovskite photovoltaic detectors demonstrate an excellent air-exposure stability for more than two months without particular encapsulation. These excellent performances are attributed to a well-controlled expansive gas\u2013solid reaction and formation of perovskite crystallites that collide and pinch off the pinhole leakage paths at the grain boundaries. More importantly, the accumulated strain at the colliding grain boundaries leads to a selective evaporation of MAI during post-growth annealing, and thus passivate the local defects by the remnant PbI2 layer. These results highlight the potential of LFCVD perovskite materials in developing ultra-fast and self-driven photovoltaic detectors with outstanding stability and scalability.",

This was achieved by loading Cl \u2212  ligands on closely-packed PbI 2  particle film\u2014a scaffold that allowed in situ formation of perovskite active layer. The introducing of Cl \u2212  ligands served the Cl-capped and thus electrostatically-charged PbI 2  nanoparticles showed improved colloidal stability in DMF, which facilitated the preparation of PbI 2  film. More importantly, during the process of CH 3 NH 3 I (MAI) deposition i.e. the growth of perovskite materials, the presence of three-dimensional Cl \u2212  ligand matrix favored the formation of dense perovskite film. Moreover, a desired release of chloride was also achieved, thus promote the rearrangement of the perovskite during the volume expansion process. This finally led to a PCE of PSCs exceeding 16.42% under AM 1.5 irradiation. Therefore, surface-activation with Cl-ligand matrix could provide guidelines for the morphology optimization and the perovskite devices performance enhancement.",

        "abstract": "Seeking long cycle lifetime and high rate performance are still challenging aspects to promote the application of silicon-loaded lithium ion batteries (LIBs), where optimal structural and compositional design are critical to maximize a synergistic effect in composite core-shell nanowire anode structures. We here propose and demonstrate a high quality conformal coating of an amorphous Si (a-Si) thin film over a matrix of highly cross-linked CuO nanowires (NWs). The conformal a-Si coating can serve as both a high capacity storage medium and a high quality binder that joins crossing CuO NWs into a continuous network. And the CuO NWs can be reduced into highly conductive Cu cores in low temperature H2 annealing. In this way, we have demonstrated an excellent cycling stability that lasts more than 700 (or 1000) charge/discharge cycles at a current density of 3.6 A g(-1) (or 1 A g(-1)), with a high capacity retention rate of 80%. Remarkably, these Cu/a-Si core-shell anode structures can survive an extremely high charging current density of 64 A g(-1) for 25 runs, and then recover 75% initial capacity when returning to 1 A g(-1). We also present the first and straightforward experimental proof that these robust highly-cross-linked core-shell networks can preserve the structural integrity even after 1000 runs of cycling. All these results indicate a new and convenient strategy towards a high performance Si-loaded battery application.",

We here report a new hierarchical structure of crystalline Si nanowires (c-Si NWs) grafted upon ultra-long tin dioxide (SnO2) NW trunks, where the latter frame up a large, conductive and stable architecture (i) to achieve a high mass-loading of c-Si NWs for Li-ion storage and (ii) to guarantee a good electric contact and fast charging process. The Si NWs branches are produced via a low-temperature vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth catalyzed by Sn droplets produced during a simple H2 plasma treatment upon the SnO2 trunks. Compared to other Si or SnO2 NW-based anodes structures, the c-Si/SnO2 NWs hierarchical structure demonstrates an outstanding performance with a high mass-load (~1.5 mg/cm2) and a high areal capacity (~1.8 mAh/cm2) after 100 cycles, without the use of any additional conductive polymer binder, highlighting the unique synergistic benefit of this hierarchical structure in boosting simultaneously the capacity and stability of Si-loaded Li-ion batteries.",

It is ideally suited for processing sensory data for intelligence computing, decision-making or context cognition. Despite rapid development, conventional artificial synapses exhibit poor connection flexibility and require separate data acquisition circuitry, resulting in limited functionalities and significant hardware redundancy. Here we report a novel light-stimulated artificial synapse based on a graphene-nanotube hybrid phototransistor that can directly convert optical stimuli into a neural image for further neuronal analysis. Our optically-driven synapses involve multiple steps of plasticity mechanisms and importantly exhibit flexible tuning of both short- and long-term plasticity. Furthermore, our neuromorphic phototransistor can take multiple pre-synaptic light stimuli via wavelength-division multiplexing and allows advanced optical processing through charge-trap-mediated optical coupling. The capability of complex neuromorphic functionalities in a simple silicon-compatible device paves the way for novel neuromorphic computing architectures involving photonics.",

By performing broadband pump-probe measurements, we experimentally proved that molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) grown CdAs exhibits strong and tunable saturable absorption effects across 1-2\u00a0\u03bcm. By further inserting the CdAs film into the cavities of Tm- and Er-doped fiber lasers, we obtained stable mode-locked operations at 1.96 and 1.56\u00a0\u03bcm. Our results experimentally establish that CdAs is a promising broadband saturable absorber (SA) for pulsed lasers in the infrared range.",

        "abstract": "Heterostructures based on two-dimensional (2D) materials have sparked wide interests in both fundamental physics and applied devices. Recently, Dirac/Weyl semimetals are emerging as capable functional materials for optoelectronic devices. However, thus far the interfacial coupling of an all-semimetal 2D heterostructure has not been investigated, and its effects on optoelectronic properties remain less well understood. Here, a heterostructure comprising of all semi-metallic constituents, namely graphene and WTe, is fabricated. Standard photocurrent measurements on a graphene/WTe phototransistor reveal a pronounced photocurrent enhancement (a photoresponsivity ~8.7\u2009A/W under 650\u2009nm laser illumination). Transport and photocurrent mapping suggest that both photovoltaic and photothermoelectric effects contribute to the enhanced photoresponse of the hybrid system. Our results help to enrich the understanding of new and emerging device concepts based on 2D layered materials.",

        "abstract": "Graphene has been widely investigated for use in high-performance photodetectors due to its broad absorption band and high carrier mobility. While exhibiting remarkably strong absorption in the ultraviolet, fabrication of long-term stable, large-scale integrable, graphene-based ultraviolet photodetector has proved a challenge. Here, using graphene as a template for C60 assembly, we synthesized a large-scale all-carbon hybrid film with inherently strong and tunable UV aborption. Efficient exciton dissociation at the heterointerface and enhanced optical absorption enables extremely high photoconductive gain, resulting in a UV photoresponsivity of ~10^7 A/W. Interstingly, due to the e-h recombination process at the heterointerface, the response time can be modulated by the gate voltage. More importantly, the use of all-carbon hybrid materials ensures robust operation and further allows the demonstration of an exemplary 5\u00d75 two-dimensional photodetector array. The devices exhibit negligible degradation in figures of merit even after two month of operation, indicating excellent environmental robustness. The combination of high responsivity, reliability and scalable processability makes this new all-carbon film a promising candidate for future integrable optoelectronics.",

However, thus far, studies on the optical properties of this emerging material have been significantly hindered by the lack of large-area, high-quality WTe2 materials. Here, we grow a centimeter-scale, highly crystalline WTe2 ultrathin film (\u223c35\u2009nm) by a pulsed laser deposition technique. Broadband pump-probe spectroscopy (1.2\u20132.5\u2009\u03bcm) reveals a peculiar ultrafast optical response where an initial photo-bleaching signal (lasting \u223c3 ps) is followed by a long-lived photoinduced absorption signature. Nonlinear absorption characterization using femtosecond pulses confirms the saturable absorption response of the WTe2 ultrathin films, and we further demonstrated a mode-locked Thulium fiber laser using a WTe2 absorber. Our work provides important insights into linear and nonlinear optical responses of WTe2 thin films.",

        "abstract": "Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures constructed with two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted great interests, due to their fascinating properties and potential for novel applications. While earlier efforts have advanced the understanding of the ultrafast cross-layer charge transfer process in 2D heterostructures, mechanisms for the interfacial photocarrier recombination remain, to a large extent, unclear. Here, we investigate a heterostructure comprised of black phosphorus (BP) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), with a type-II band alignment. Interestingly, it is found that the photo-generated electrons in MoS2 (transferred from BP) exhibit an ultrafast lifetime of about 5 ps, significantly shorter than those of the constituent materials. By corroborating with the relaxation of photo-excited holes in BP, it is revealed that the ultrafast time constant is as a result of efficient Langevin recombination, where the high hole mobility of BP facilitates a large recombination coefficient (approximately 2x10^-10 m^2/s). In addition, broadband transient absorption spectroscopy confirms that the hot electrons transferred to MoS2 distribute over a broad energy range following an ultrafast thermalization. The rate of the interlayer Langevin recombination is found to exhibit no energy level dependence. Our findings provide essential insights into the fundamental photo-physics in type-II 2D heterostructures, and also provide useful guidelines for customizing photocarrier lifetimes of BP for high-speed photo-sensitive devices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Low-dimensional organic materials have attracted intense attention due to their potential applications in low-cost, flexible electronics and optoelectronics. C 60  has shown promise for high-performance photodetectors due to its strong light-matter interactions. However, limited by its poor crystallinity on oxide substrates and short exciton diffusion length, the potential of pristine C 60  as photodetector channel material has not been fully exploited. Here, we fabricated a graphene-C 60 -graphene photoconductor, where well-crystallized C 60  film is obtained on a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) template and the two graphene sheets function as source and drain electrodes. The all-carbon device covers ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (200\u2013800\u202fnm), and the photoresponsivity reaches up to 5510\u202fA\u202fW \u22121 @360\u202fnm and 2280\u202fA\u202fW \u22121 @405\u202fnm, with an operating bandwidth of \u223c6\u202fkHz. In addition, the gate-tunable graphene/C 60  interface barrier enables an adjustable responsivity. Our results confirm the potential of pristine C 60  as highly-sensitive photon sensor and video-frame-rate imaging application for the UV-Visible band.",

        "abstract": "We have fabricated the InGaN/AlGaInN multiple quantum wells with lattice-matched AlGaN/InGaN superlattices barriers (SL-MQWs). The lattice-matched superlattices promote the formation of the high-quality MQWs and eliminate the large polarization electric field. Highly excited photoluminescence measurement is performed by Ti-sapphire pulse laser with the maximal carrier density of 10 20  cm \u22123 . Under such high carrier density, the conventional InGaN/GaN MQWs (C-MQWs) have an additional nonradiative loss of carriers and suffer from the efficiency droop effect, while slight droop behavior is observed in the SL-MQWs sample. The results show that the substitution of AlGaN/InGaN superlattices as quantum barriers can effectively suppress the droop behavior at highly excited condition.",

        "abstract": "A new approach to fabricating high-quality AlInGaN film as a lattice-matched barrier layer in multiple quantum wells (MQWs) is presented. The high-quality AlInGaN film is realized by growing the AlGaN/InGaN short period superlattices through metalorganic chemical vapor deposition, and then being used as a barrier in the MQWs. The crystalline quality of the MQWs with the lattice-matched AlInGaN barrier and that of the conventional InGaN/GaN MQWs are characterized by x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The photoluminescence (PL) properties of the InGaN/AlInGaN MQWs are investigated by varying the excitation power density and temperature through comparing with those of the InGaN/GaN MQWs. The integral PL intensity of InGaN/AlInGaN MQWs is over 3 times higher than that of InGaN/GaN MQWs at room temperature under the highest excitation power. Temperature-dependent PL further demonstrates that the internal quantum efficiency of InGaN/AlInGaN MQWs (76.1%) is much higher than that of InGaN/GaN MQWs (21%). The improved luminescence performance of InGaN/AlInGaN MQWs can be attributed to the distinct reduction of the barrier-well lattice mismatch and the strain-induced non-radiative recombination centers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Gallium nitride (GaN) films homo-epitaxially grown on GaN/sapphire templates and free standing GaN substrates by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PA-MBE) have been investigated. After optimizations of growth temperature, the Ga/N flux ratio, surface preparation as well as initial growth process, the high quality MBE-GaN films were obtained. Combined with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements, the TD densities were measured \u223c4.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 8 \u202fcm \u22122  and \u223c5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 5 \u202fcm \u22122  for MBE-grown GaN films grown on GaN/sapphire templates and free standing GaN substrates, respectively. The observations of TEM prove the clear interface and well-arranged atomic lattice between substrates and as-grown layers. Besides, a flat and smooth surface with step-flow growth mode is observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Photoluminescence (PL) measurements exhibit that the linewidth for free excitons is as narrow as 4\u202fmeV at low temperature of 8\u202fK and the deep level related yellow band emission \u223c550\u202fnm have been effectively suppressed at room temperature. The process optimization and obtained results give us wide latitude to fabricate high performance devices with lower tolerance to dislocation density.",

With a current-induced temperature change in the range of 297-336\u00a0K, the modulation depth of the device is found to be significantly altered from 33% to 76% (under the irradiation of a 1560\u00a0nm femtosecond laser). The broad tuning of the modulation depth is attributed to the strong temperature dependence of the carrier concentration close to room temperature. The simple tuning mechanism uncovered here, together with the compatibility with III-V compounds substrate, such as GaAs, points to the potential of fabricating broadband, electrically tunable, SESAM-like devices based on emerging bulk Dirac materials.",

Here, we discover that the nanobelts of Weyl semimetal NbAs maintain a high mobility even in the presence of a high sheet carrier density. We develop a growth scheme to synthesize single crystalline NbAs nanobelts with tunable Fermi levels. Owing to a large surface-to-bulk ratio, we argue that a 2D surface state gives rise to the high sheet carrier density, even though the bulk Fermi level is located near the Weyl nodes. A surface sheet conductance up to 5-100\u2009S per \u25a1 is realized, exceeding that of conventional 2D electron gases, quasi-2D metal films, and topological insulator surface states. Corroborated by theory, we attribute the origin of the ultrahigh conductance to the disorder-tolerant Fermi arcs. The evidenced low-dissipation property of Fermi arcs has implications for both fundamental study and potential electronic applications.",

Here, we investigated the characteristics of the impurity incorporation at threading dislocations by HCl vapor phase etching and cathodoluminescence (CL) measurements. The distinctive etch pits induced by HCl vapor phase etching correspond definitely to different types of dislocations, and the etching process causes simultaneously H incorporation at a high temperature. CL spectra of the etch pits were analyzed, and the observed difference in the redshift of near band emission peak indicates that mix dislocations are more favorable for impurity incorporations than that of edge dislocations. The understanding on the impurity incorporation behavior at threading dislocations helps to obtain high quality GaN nanostructures.",

Here, oxide-based electric double-layer (EDL) thin-film transistors were fabricated using 3-triethoxysilylpropylamine modified graphene oxide (KH550-GO) electrolyte as the gate dielectrics. Resulting from the EDL effect and electrochemical doping between mobile protons and the indium-zinc-oxide channel layer, long-term synaptic plasticity was emulated in our devices. Synaptic functions including long-term memory, synaptic temporal integration, and dynamic filters were successfully reproduced. In particular, spike rate-dependent plasticity (SRDP), one of the basic learning rules of long-term plasticity in the neural network where the synaptic weight changes according to the rate of presynaptic spikes, was emulated in our devices. Our results may facilitate the development of neuromorphic computational systems.",

By exploiting the band alignment between 2D inorganic and organic semiconductors, the first multi-functional synaptic transistor based on a molybdenum disulfide (MoS )/perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) hybrid heterojunction, with remarkable short-term plasticity (STP) and long-term plasticity (LTP), is reported. Owing to the elaborate design of the energy band structure, both robust electrical and optical modulation are achieved through carriers transfer at the interface of the heterostructure, which is still a challenging task to this day. In electrical modulation, synaptic inhibition and excitation can be achieved simultaneously in the same device by gate voltage tuning. Notably, a minimum inhibition of 3% and maximum facilitation of 500% can be obtained by increasing the electrical number, and the response to different frequency signals indicates a dynamic filtering characteristic. It exhibits flexible tunability of both STP and LTP and synaptic weight changes of up to 60, far superior to previous work in optical modulation. The fully 2D MoS /PTCDA hybrid heterojunction artificial synapse opens up a whole new path for the urgent need for neuromorphic computation devices.",

In this letter, nanotexturing based on reactive ion etching (RIE) was adopted to increase the blue response and conversion efficiency of multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cells. After antireflection film deposition, the reflectivity at 400 nm remarkably decreases from 27.76% for acid-textured wafer to 4.46% for RIE-textured wafer. The average conversion efficiency of industrial wafer-scale (15.6 cm    $times ,, 15.6$    cm) mc-Si solar cells increased from 18.10% to 18.72%.

In this letter, a short-term plasticity simulation in an indium\u2013gallium\u2013zinc oxide (IGZO) electric-double-layer (EDL) transistor is investigated. For synaptic facilitation and depression function emulation, three-terminal EDL transistor is reduced to a two-terminal synaptic device with two modified connection schemes. Furthermore, high-pass and low-pass filtering characteristics are also successfully emulated not only for fixed-rate spike train but also for Poisson-like spike train.

These flexible TFTs exhibit high performance with a high ON/OFF ratio of 107 and a high mobility of around 26 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121. Resistor-loaded inverters are demonstrated both in a bottom-gate mode and an in-plane-gate mode. Logic AND operation is realized in a device with two in-plane gates. Significantly, the universal logic NAND is experimentally demonstrated using a one transistor/one resistor structure by combining NOT and AND logics together.

        "abstract": "All external sensory stimuli produce a spatiotemporal pattern of action potentials, which is transmitted to the biological neural system to be processed. The relative timing of synaptic spikes from different presynaptic neurons represents the features of the stimuli. A fundamental prerequisite in cortical information processing is the discrimination of different spatiotemporal input sequences. Here, capacitively coupled multiterminal oxide-based neuro-transistors are proposed for spatiotemporal information processing, mimicking the dendritic discriminability of different spatiotemporal input sequences. The experimental results demonstrate that such multiterminal neuromorphic devices can act as spatiotemporal information processing compartments for fundamental cortical computation. Also, as an example of spatiotemporal information processing, sound location functionality of the human brain is also emulated by constructing a simple artificial neural network based on such oxide-based multiterminal neuro-transistors.",

A high specific capacitance of 5    $mu text{F}$   /cm 2  is measured at 1 Hz in the beeswax film due to the electric-double-layer effect. The current ON/OFF ratio, subthreshold swing, and field-effect mobility of the IZO-based TFTs on paper substrate are estimated to be    $7.6times 10 ^{6}$   , 86 mV/decade, and 14.6 cm 2  /Vs, respectively. In addition, our results demonstrate that the flexible oxide-based TFTs on paper substrate show a good stability after 3000 times bending and 30 days aging testing. Such flexible low-voltage oxide-based homojunction TFTs have potential applications in portable paper electronics.",

The strains were applied using a wafer bending system to avoid processing effects on the NBTI characteristics as a result of strain engineering. We confirm experimentally, for the first time, that both uniaxial and biaxial compressive strains are advantageous in terms of the NBTI improvement in Si pMOSFETs. However, the NBTI reliability was degraded under both uniaxial and biaxial tensile strains. These results could not be explained by considering only the gate leakage current change due to the strain. The strain-induced modulation of the interaction between the carriers and Si-H bonds at the interface must also be considered.",

When such device is operated in a quasi-static dual-gate synergic sensing mode, it shows a high pH sensitivity of ~105\u2009mV/pH. Our results also demonstrate that single-spike dynamic mode can remarkably improve pH sensitivity and reduce response/recover time and power consumption. Moreover, we find that an appropriate negative bias applied on the sensing gate electrode can further enhance the pH sensitivity and reduce the power consumption. Our flexible neuromorphic transistors provide a new-concept sensory platform for biochemical detection with high sensitivity, rapid response and ultralow power consumption.",

        "abstract": "Graphene nanosheets (GNSs) were modified with CdS nanoparticles (NPs) using supercritical CO2 (SC CO2), which has gas-like diffusivity, low viscosity, and near-zero surface tension. The resulting CdS NP/GNS nanocomposites were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Distinct morphologies of CdS NP/GNS nanocomposites decorated on the GNS surface were obtained at different SC CO2 pressures, temperatures, and durations and in different sources. Results showed that the sources and SC CO2 significantly influenced the aggregation or assembly behavior of the CdS NP/GNS nanocomposites on the GNSs. The formation mechanism of the distinct nanohybrid structures was studied by Raman mapping. A difference was noted between the Raman spectra of pristine graphene nanosheets and CdS NP/GNS nanocomposites. This result can be ascribed to the CdS NPs anchored onto the GNS defects and to the improved quality of the GNSs under SC CO2. The photo-current densities of CdS NP/GNS nanocomposites were at least three times higher than that of the pristine CdS NPs at the same applied voltage for photoelectrochemical water splitting. The findings suggested that highly efficient graphene-supported NP photoelectrocatalysts can be fabricated by the supercritical fluid method and that graphene can serve as a favorable photoelectrocatalytic carrier, with promising potential applications in environmental and energy fields.

        "abstract": "Aprotic Li-O2 batteries have attracted a huge amount of interest in the past decade owing to their extremely high energy density. However, identifying a desirable cathodic catalyst for this promising battery system is one of the biggest challenges at present. In this work, a multi-layered Fe2O3/graphene nanosheets (Fe2O3/GNS) composite with sandwich structure was synthesized using an easy thermal casting method, and served as a cathodic catalyst for aprotic Li-O2 batteries. The aprotic Li-O2 cell with the Fe2O3/GNS catalyst demonstrated a better reversibility, lower overpotential for oxygen evolution, and a higher Coulombic efficiency (close to 100%) than those of pure GNS. An excellent rate performance and good cycle stability were also confirmed. The results, characterized by ex and in situ methods, revealed that the dominant discharge product Li2O2 was decomposed below 4.35 V. This superior electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the unique sandwich structure of the Fe2O3/GNS catalyst with mesopores, which can provide\u00a0substantially more catalytic sites and prevent direct contact between carbon and Li2O2.

However, the high cost and low abundance limit wide application of such metals. As such, one challenging issue is the development of low-cost and high-efficiency electrocatalysts for such purposes. In this study, we synthesized Co\u2013FeS2/CoS2 heterostructures via a hydrothermal method for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefitting from their unique three-dimensional hierarchical nanostructures, Co-doped FeS2, and CoS2 formed heterostructures on Co\u2013FeS2 petals, which bestowed remarkable electrocatalytic properties upon Co\u2013FeS2/CoS2 nanostructures. Co\u2013FeS2/CoS2 effectively catalyzed the OER with an overpotential of 278 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 in 1 M KOH solution, and also is capable of driving a current density \u221210 mA cm\u22122 at an overpotential of \u2212103 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The overpotential of the OER and HER only decreased by 5 mV and 3 mV after 1000 cycles. Our Co\u2013FeS2/CoS2 materials may offer a promising alternative to noble metal-based electrocatalysts for water splitting.",

Beyond optoelectronics, the BP nanostructures have recently shown great potential in producing singlet oxygen for photodynamic therapy, but its underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report the observation of efficient triplet formation in BP quantum dots, which might be responsible for the singlet oxygen generation. In addition to the common dynamic behaviors of semiconductors, a long-lived photoinduced bleaching signal with a lifetime of 26 \u03bcs has been explicitly identified in BP quantum dots, which can be ascribed to the intersystem crossing from singlet to triplet states as confirmed by oxygen quenching test. The observation of highly efficient intersystem crossing in BPQDs well explains its superior performance in photodynamic therapy and indicates its exotic spintronic and magneto-optical properties.",

        "abstract": "Ordered porous RuO materials with various pore structure parameters are prepared via a hard-template method and are used as the carbon-free cathodes for Li-O batteries under the voltage cutoff cycle mode. The influences of pore structure parameters of porous RuO on electrochemical performance are systematically studied. Results indicate that specific surface area and pore size determine the specific capacity and round-trip efficiency of Li-O batteries. Too small pores cause pore blockage and hinder the diffusion pathways of Li and O , thereby causing small specific capacity and high overpotentials. Too large pores weaken the mechanical property of porous RuO , thereby causing the rapid decrease in capacity during electrochemical reaction. The Li-O battery based on the RuO cathode with an average pore size of 16 nm (RuO -16) exhibits a high round-trip efficiency of \u224875.6% and an excellent cycling stability of up to 70 cycles at 100 mA g with a voltage window of 2.5-4.0 V. The superior performance of RuO -16 can be attributed to its optimal pore structure parameters. Furthermore, the in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry test demonstrates that RuO can effectively reduce parasitic reactions compared with carbon materials.",

Previously, the SnS2 conversion/reduction step of the reaction mechanism is generally believed to be irreversible or only partially reversible, which severely underestimates the theoretical capacity of SnS2. In this work, SnS2 nanoparticles have been successfully stacked on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) via a facile and effective solvothermal method using ethylene glycol as a chelant. The SnS2/graphene nanocomposite retained many of the original 2D characteristics of the graphene nanosheets. As a result, Li+ storage properties were significantly improved. The SnS2/RGO nanocomposites show a higher storage capacity of 939.0 mA h g\u22121 after 30 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g\u22121, and a long-term cycle capacity of 615.5 mA h g\u22121 even after 200 cycles at 1 A g\u22121. The superior cycling stability of the SnS2/RGO electrode is attributed to greater reversibility in the initial conversion reaction, ascribed to the presence of the Sn nanoparticles.",

However, the design of GeO 2  based anodes with satisfactory cycling ability and high capacity still presents a big challenge because of strict requirements in the need for a special type of solvent, a complicated preparation process, high energy and material costs, and/or difficulty in process upscaling. In the present work, GeO 2 /RGO nanocomposite is successfully synthesized as an anode material by a simple and green method, which stacked the GeO 2  nanoparticles directly on the reduced graphene oxide sheets in an in situ process. The sample exhibits high specific capacity and enhanced rate capacity as an electrode material for lithium ion batteries. GeO 2 /RGO nanocomposite shows a higher storage capacity of 1020.4\u00a0mA\u00a0h\u00a0g \u22121  (theoretical capacity 1125\u00a0mA\u00a0h\u00a0g \u22121 ) after 30 cycles with a current density of 0.1\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121 , and a long-term cycle capacity of 464\u00a0mA\u00a0h\u00a0g \u22121  even after 100 cycles at 1\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121 .

        "abstract": "Monodisperse mesoporous anatase microspheres were prepared by a combination of sol\u2013gel and liquid\u2013crystal template methods. With the change in annealing temperature, the pore structure parameters of samples were regulated. The influence of pore structure parameters on lithium-ion battery performance was systematically investigated. Results of electrochemical test and analysis demonstrated that the pore structure parameters significantly influenced the specific capacity, charging and discharging curves, rate capability, and cycle performance of the batteries. The first irreversible capacity increased with increased specific surface area. Materials with larger specific surface area showed better rate capability. When the average pore size was too small, the transport of Li in the electrolyte was impeded, which affected the rate capability of the materials. Based on the charging and discharging curves, the capacity of the plateau section corresponding to lithium insertion/extraction ions in the interstitial octahedral sites of anatase became smaller with increased specific surface area. By contrast, the capacity of the oblique line section corresponding to the Li insertion/extraction into/from the surface layer of anatase became larger. The pore volume influenced the cycling stability.",

Porous \u03b2-SiC has a large surface area that can increase the number of reactive sites and shorten the charge transport pathways between the material interior and surface, thereby significantly improving the hydrogen evolution reaction performance. In the present study, hierarchical macroporous \u03b2-SiC monolith composed of nanocrystals was directly prepared using SiO2 opal as both template and precursor via the magnesiothermic reduction method at 750\u00a0\u00b0C. An interfacial magnesiothermic reaction model was presented as well. The \u03b2-SiC sample exhibited high photoelectric conversion performance and stability as a catalyst for hydrogen evolution.",

        "abstract": "Although possessing extremely high energy density, lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) battery suffered from large charge overpotential, low round-trip efficiency and poor cycling life, which limited the practical application of this smart system. Ru particles functionalized graphene aerogels (Ru-GAs) were designed and directly used as a free-standing cathode for Li-O2 battery. The Ru-GAs showed hierarchical pores, which had the pore volumes of 2.8 and 14.1\u2009cm3\u2009g\u22121 below and above critical pore diameter of 100\u2009nm. The Ru-GA cathode in Li-O2 battery delivered a high capacity of more than 12\u2009000\u2009mAh\u2009g\u22121 and excellent cycling retention, which was mainly attributed to the three-dimensional porosity, abundant active sites with Ru particles and chemical stability arising from the character of binder-free cathode. Based on the results of in situ gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry analysis, the reaction mechanism during charge process in aprotic electrolyte was proposed by the theory of three oxidation stages.",

However, the application of these dichalcogenides in Li-ion batteries is hindered by limitations in large-scale solution synthesis of SnS nanobelts. In this study, we developed a universal hydrothermal approach for the synthesis of SnS nanobelts and proposed an underlying mechanism for the formation reaction. When used as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, SnS nanobelts maintain a discharge capacity of 889.9\u00a0mAhg \u22121  after 50 cycles at a current density of 0.1\u00a0A/g. The nanobelts also exhibit high electrochemical performance, high rate capacity, and high reversible capacity. These results demonstrate that SnS nanobelts are potential anode materials for high-performance energy storage applications.",

Two-dimensional (2D) layered semiconductors such as tin sulfide (SnS) and tin disulfide (SnS 2 ) are promising materials for fabricating quantum dots (QDs) devices. However, the challenges in the synthesis of QDs with pure phases severely limit applications in such fields. In this work, uniform SnS and SnS 2  QDs were synthesized via a convenient and facile ultrasonic method. TEM and AFM images confirmed the morphology of the SnS and SnS 2  QDs. The optical characteristics of the QDs were obtained via UV\u2013vis absorption and Raman spectroscopy. Finally, volt-current measurements of devices fabricated using the SnS and SnS 2  QDs were carried out. Our results demonstrate the potential of SnS and SnS 2  QDs for optical and electronic applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides, such as tungsten disulfide (WS 2 ), have been actively studied as suitable candidates for anode materials used in lithium ion batteries recently, due to their remarkable ion intercalation properties. However, the difficulties in the synthesis of phase-pure WS 2 , restacking between WS 2  nanosheets, low electronic conductivity and brittle nature of WS 2  severely limit its Li-ion batteries application. Here, we adopt a one-pot method for synthesizing of WS 2 /reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO) composite to improve the battery performance dramatically. The WS 2 /rGO anode shows a stable discharge capacity of 431.2\u00a0mAh/g, at a current density of 0.1 A/g after 100 cycles, while the capacity of bare WS 2  is only 65.5\u00a0mAh/g under the same condition. The added graphene oxide is reduced to rGO in reaction process and constitute stable composite with WS 2 , not only avoiding the restacking between WS 2  nanosheets and improving the conductive properties, but also promoting the reduction of WO 3  effectively. Our work may provide a possible route to avoid oxygen impurities in transition metal dichalcogenides.",

The presence of active sites at the edges and the higher specific surface area of these materials are crucial to the photocatalytic activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction. Here, WS2 quantum dots (QDs) have been successfully synthesized by using a combination of grinding and sonication techniques. The morphology of the QDs was observed, using transmission electron microscopy and an atomic force microscope, to have uniform sizes of less than 5 nm. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements show that the current density of WS2 QDs under illumination is almost two times higher than that of pristine WS2. Furthermore, these high-quality WS2 QDs may have various applications in optoelectronics, solar cells, and biomedicine.",

The photoluminescence (PL) integral intensities of NR samples show a remarkable enhancement by a factor of up to two orders of magnitude compared with their corresponding as-grown samples at room temperature. The radiative recombination in NR samples is found to be greatly enhanced due to not only the suppressed non-radiative recombination but also the strain relaxation and optical waveguide effects. It is demonstrated that elliptic NR arrays improve the light extraction greatly and have polarized emission, both of which possibly result from the broken structure symmetry. Green NR light-emitting diodes have been finally realized, with good current-voltage performance and uniform luminescence.",

In order to achieve reliable vehicle tracking we designed the dedicated algorithm to traffic images. But the most difficult problem associated with the dedicated algorithm is vector displacement estimation. So we present three criteria to evaluate different displacement vector estimation algorithms. As a result, we can evaluate the convergence time and the capability of different algorithms to resist noise and detect velocity, which is critical for practical application. After groups of experiments had in practical environment, the algorithm were able to track vehicle ate a high success rate of 90%-95%. The algorithm does not assume only physical models of vehicles. \u00a9 2006 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "The clarification of ferromagnetism in dilute magnetic oxides (DMOs) is of vital importance to realize future spintronic devices. However, the mixed control of carriers, defects, and spin in most cases is inconvenient to disclose the origin of ferromagnetism in DMOs. The perovskite complex compound of (La,Sr)TiO3 is apt to the independent control of carriers, defects, or spin through the codoping method. Here we demonstrate the combined experimental and theoretical studies on the cobalt-carbon complexes that can lead to the room-temperature ferromagnetism in perovskite chemically modified La0.4Sr0.6Ti1-xCoxO3 (LSTCO) samples. Such complexes are investigated by studying the dependence of magnetization on the concentrations of Co dopants and the in situ produced carbon that substitutes for some of the lattice oxygen atoms. The origin of ferromagnetism is attributed to the long-range-mediated magnetization among Co2+-C complexes through percolation-bound magnetic polarons, as strongly supported by the controlled experiments of thermal treatment and the structural characterization. Our density functional theoretical calculations further corroborate the important role of Co2+-C complexes on the induced robust ferromagnetism in LSTCO, in agreement with our experimental observations. The manipulation scheme of Co2+-C complexes not only provides a new understanding of the origin of ferromagnetism in DMOs but also evidences the feasibility and significance in design of other magnetic materials and spintronic devices. Moreover, the demonstrated solvothermal synthesis and postannealing method offer a facile and high-yield approach to produce high-quality transition-metal (cation) and carbon (anion) codoped DMOs to explore spintronic properties. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

It is found that the photoexcitation process follows an exponential time dependence and that the decay is logarithmic with a decay time constant of 10 5 s at 7 K. The saturation value of the absorption coefficients depends on the logarithm of the illumination-light intensity. These characteristics are associated with the slow relaxation of photoexcited carriers originating mainly from defect clusters. The relaxation behaviour of photoexcited carriers has been analysed using the macroscopic-barrier model, which is in good agreement with the observations.",

CPs are special polymers with physical and electrochemical features resembling metals, inorganic semiconductors and non-conducting polymers. To improve and extend their properties, the fabrication of CPs and CP composites has attracted intensive attention in recent decades. Some CPs are biocompatible and suitable for biomedical use. Thus, the intriguing properties of CPs make wearable, noninvasive, continuous diabetes managing devices and other potential applications in diabetes possible in the near future. To highlight the recent advances of CPs and their derived materials (especially in conducting polymer hydrogels), here we discuss their fabrication and characterization, review the current state-of-the-art research in diabetes management based on these materials and describe current challenges as well as future potential research directions.",

        "abstract": "Multiplexing, one of the main trends in biosensors, aims to detect several analytes simultaneously by integrating miniature sensors on a chip. However, precisely depositing electrode materials and selective enzymes on distinct microelectrode arrays remains an obstacle to massively produced multiplexed sensors. Here, we report on a \"drop-on-demand\" inkjet printing process to fabricate multiplexed biosensors based on nanostructured conductive hydrogels, in which the electrode material and several kinds of enzymes were printed on the electrode arrays one by one by employing a multi-nozzle inkjet system. The whole inkjet printing process can be finished within three rounds of printing and only one round of alignment. For a page of sensor arrays containing 96 working electrodes, the printing process took merely ~5 mins. The multiplexed assays can detect glucose, lactate, and triglycerides in real time with good selectivity and high sensitivity, and the results in phosphate buffer solutions and calibration serum samples are comparable. The inkjet printing process exhibited advantages of high efficiency and accuracy, which opens up substantial possibilities of massive fabrication of integrated multiplexed biosensors for human health monitoring.",

For applications in detecting food spoilage, the development of a sensor with high enough sensitivity to act as a switch for an NFC tag remains a challenge. In this Letter, we developed a nanostructured conductive polymer-based gas sensor with high sensitivity of \u0394 R/ R = 225% toward 5 ppm ammonia NH and unprecedented sensitivities of 46% and 17% toward 5 ppm putrescine and cadaverine, respectively. The gas sensor plays a critical role as a sensitive switch in the circuit of the NFC tag and enables a smartphone to readout meat spoilage when the concentration of biogenic amines is over a preset threshold. We envision the broad potential use of such intelligent sensing for food status monitoring applications in daily life, storage and supply chains.",

        "abstract": "Flexible pressure sensors are crucial for E-skins to enable tactile sensing capabilities. However, flexible pressure sensors often exhibit high hysteretic response caused by internal and external mechanical dissipations in flexible materials. The hysteresis gives rise to reliability issues, especially in the presence of dynamic stress. In this letter, we report a flexible capacitive pressure sensor design with hierarchically microstructured electrodes to obtain both high sensitivity and low hysteresis. The sparsely spaced large pyramid microstructure improves the sensitivity, whereas the small pyramid reduces the hysteresis caused by interfacial adhesion. The optimized sensor shows excellent performances in terms of high sensitivity (~3.73 kPa \u22121 ), ultralow detection limits (0.1 Pa), significantly reduced hysteresis (~4.42%), and enhanced sensing capability for pluses, which demonstrates its potential for advanced electronic skins.",

Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) observation of as-synthesized Bi 2Te 3 confirmed their morphology of the hexagonal plates. It was observed that the edge and thickness values of as-synthesized Bi 2Te 3 were in the size of 0.5-2 \u03bcm and less than 100 nm, respectively. High-resolution transmission electronic microscopy (HR-TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) results revealed that the Bi 2Te 3 plates are of single-crystal in nature with the growth direction of 112\u03040. In addition, as increasing the amount of ionic liquid, SEM results showed a novel evolution process of Bi 2Te 3 morphologies from mixture of Bi 2Te 3 nanorods and nanoplates to regular hexagonal plates, and then nanoplates with many small flecks. Furthermore, a possible mechanism regarding the formation of Bi 2Te 3 plates was proposed as well on the basis of the experimental results. The power factor of Bi 2Te 3 nanoplates is examined to evaluate its thermoelectric property. \u00a9 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.",

Synergizing the advantages of both the organic conductors and hydrogels, CPHs emerged to be candidates for high performance biosensors by providing advantageous interfaces for electrochemical bio-electrodes. Examples include the following: (1) the interface between a biomaterial and an artificial inorganic electrode material; (2) the hybrid electronic interface between an ionic carrier and an electron charge carrier; and (3) the extension of the planar electrode surface to a three-dimensional (3D) porous surface. CPHs with rationally designed 3D nanostructures and molecular structures are advantageous for enhancing the biocompatibility of the electrode, improving enzyme immobilization, creating protective layers to control diffusion, and wiring the electron transference. This review presents a brief overview of the current state-of-the-art research in electrochemical biosensors based on CPHs and describes future directions.",

        "abstract": "Pressure sensing is an important function of electronic skin devices. The development of pressure sensors that can mimic and surpass the subtle pressure sensing properties of natural skin requires the rational design of materials and devices. Here we present an ultra-sensitive resistive pressure sensor based on an elastic, microstructured conducting polymer thin film. The elastic microstructured film is prepared from a polypyrrole hydrogel using a multiphase reaction that produced a hollow-sphere microstructure that endows polypyrrole with structure-derived elasticity and a low effective elastic modulus. The contact area between the microstructured thin film and the electrodes increases with the application of pressure, enabling the device to detect low pressures with ultra-high sensitivity. Our pressure sensor based on an elastic microstructured thin film enables the detection of pressures of less than 1Pa and exhibits a short response time, good reproducibility, excellent cycling stability and temperature-stable sensing.",

        "title": "Energy gels: A bio-inspired material platform for advanced energy applications",
        "abstract": "Energy conversion and storage systems with high efficiency have attracted great research interest in recent years. To improve the performance of energy devices, nanomaterials with delicately controlled structures and interfaces have been applied. However, low-dimensional nanomaterials suffer from inhomogeneous aggregation, severe re-stacking, and the formation of bottlenecks and poor contacts during the processing and assembly, thus hindering the transport of electrons or ions in energy devices. Gel materials, a special class of bio-inspired materials, are emerging as promising candidates to overcome the drawbacks of low-dimensional nanomaterials. The 3D nanostructured gel network promotes electron transport along the backbone while facilitating the diffusion of ions through hierarchical pores, as well as providing high surface area for interfacial reactions. In addition, the properties of gels can be facilely tuned, thereby further extending their applications and improving their performance. To date, various synthetic strategies have been developed for the preparation of gel materials, including carbon-based gels, conductive polymer gels, ionically conductive gels and inorganic gels. These gel materials have successfully served as electrode materials, electrolytes, self-supported current collectors, 3D binder systems, etc. in various kinds of energy conversion and storage applications, such as lithium ion batteries, supercapacitors, catalysts, and fuel cells. In this review, we summarize the synthesis of various electrically conductive gel materials, including carbon-based gels, conductive polymer gels, and ionically conductive gels and their applications in energy conversion and storage devices. We also provide the perspective on the future developments of these gel materials in energy-related fields.",

        "abstract": "Organic electroactive materials represent a new generation of sustainable energy storage technology due to their unique features including environmental benignity, material sustainability, and highly tailorable properties. Here a carbonyl-based organic salt Na2C6O6, sodium rhodizonate (SR) dibasic, is systematically investigated for high-performance sodium-ion batteries. A combination of structural control, electrochemical analysis, and computational simulation show that rational morphological control can lead to significantly improved sodium storage performance. A facile antisolvent method was developed to synthesize microbulk, microrod, and nanorod structured SRs, which exhibit strong size-dependent sodium ion storage properties. The SR nanorod exhibited the best performance to deliver a reversible capacity of \u223c190 mA h g\u20131 at 0.1 C with over 90% retention after 100 cycles. At a high rate of 10 C, 50% of the capacity can be obtained due to enhanced reaction kinetics, and such high electrochemical activi...",

However, initiating the impact ionization of avalanche breakdown requires a high applied electric field in a long active region, which hampers carrier multiplication with a high gain, low bias and superior noise performance. Here we report the observation of ballistic avalanche phenomena in sub-mean free path (MFP) scaled vertical InSe/black phosphorus (BP) heterostructures. We use these heterojunctions to fabricate avalanche photodetectors (APDs) with a sensitive mid-infrared light detection (4\u2009\u03bcm wavelength) and impact ionization transistors with a steep subthreshold swing (<0.25\u2009mV\u2009dec). The devices show a low avalanche threshold (<1\u2009V), low noise figure and distinctive density spectral shape. Our transport measurements suggest that the breakdown originates from a ballistic avalanche phenomenon, where the sub-MFP BP channel support the lattice impact ionization by electrons and holes and the abrupt current amplification without scattering from the obstacles in a deterministic nature. Our results provide new strategies for the development of advanced photodetectors via efficient carrier manipulation at the nanoscale.",

We observe linear frequency red-shifts with increasing temperature for the first order Raman active E12g, A1g, Raman inactive B12g mode, and the second order \u03c92 mode, which can be attributed to the anharmonic effect of the interatomic potential energy. The temperature coefficients of the out-of-plane vibrational B12g modes and inplane vibrational E12g modes are similarly around \u22120.013\u2009cm\u22121/K, while lower than that of out-of-plane vibration A1g mode at \u22120.009\u2009cm\u22121/K. The temperature coefficient of \u03c92 mode is \u22120.00521\u2009cm\u22121/K, approximately half of those of the first order modes, and the temperature coefficient of transverse acoustic TA (M) mode is indirectly deduced as \u22120.0102\u2009cm\u22121/K, which shows the corresponding Mo-Te stretching bonds of TA (M) mode behavior similarly to those of optical Raman vibrations.

To investigate double-resonant Raman scattering processes of graphene, we study the characteristic 2D Raman mode profiles of 1\u20134 layer graphene (supported and suspended) and graphite using both UV and visible excitation lasers at room temperature. At UV excitation energy of 3.81\u00a0eV, we observe that three scattering processes contribute dominantly to 2D mode profiles, which is a general feature for all graphene samples, showing the intensity diminishing of other scattering processes as theoretically predicted. We also find the asymmetric  G  \u2217  double resonant mode is sensitive to the high incident laser energy, and I(G)/I(2D) of monolayer graphene is most sensitive to UV laser energy due to near off resonant behavior of 2D modes at high excitation energy. Our results provide direct experimental evidences to further understand double-resonance scattering mechanism of few layer graphene.",

        "abstract": "2D transition metal dichalcogenides are emerging with tremendous potential in many optoelectronic applications due to their strong light\u2013matter interactions. To fully explore their potential in photoconductive detectors, high responsivity is required. Here, high responsivity phototransistors based on few-layer rhenium disulfide (ReS2) are presented. Depending on the back gate voltage, source drain bias and incident optical light intensity, the maximum attainable photoresponsivity can reach as high as 88 600 A W\u22121, which is a record value compared to other individual 2D materials with similar device structures and two orders of magnitude higher than that of monolayer MoS2. Such high photoresponsivity is attributed to the increased light absorption as well as the gain enhancement due to the existence of trap states in the few-layer ReS2 flakes. It further enables the detection of weak signals, as successfully demonstrated with weak light sources including a lighter and limited fluorescent lighting. Our studies underscore ReS2 as a promising material for future sensitive optoelectronic applications.",

However, one of the major issues is that the experimental mobility is much lower than the theoretical phonon limit. We carry out systematic investigations on the electron transport and field-effect transistors of monolayer TMDs, including MoS 2  and WS 2 . We find that the major extrinsic mobility limiting factors are charged impurities, traps and point defects. We develop a facile low-temperature thiol chemistry to repair the sulfur vacancies and improve the interface quality, resulting in significant reduction of the charged impurities and traps. In combination with high-k dielectrics, we are able to achieve room-temperature mobility of \u223c150cm 2 /Vs and 83cm 2 /Vs for monolayer MoS 2  and WS 2 , respectively. We further develop a theoretical model to quantitatively correlate these extrinsic scattering sources to measured electrical data. Our study shows that interface engineering is critical for high-performance transistors based on 2D semiconductors.",

        "abstract": "2D semiconductors are promising candidates for future electronic device applications due to their immunity to short-channel effects (SCE), but many issues regarding mobility, contact, interface and power consumption still remain (Fig. 1). We develop a low-field model to calculate the mobility of monolayer MoS 2  FETs. Guided by the model, high carrier mobility of 150 cm 2 /Vs and saturation current over  $450 mu mathrm{A}/mu mathrm{m}$  are realized in long-channel monolayer MoS 2  FETs, through a series of interface optimization by high- $boldsymbol{kappa}$  dielectric and thiol chemical treatment. For low-power applications, we demonstrate hysteresis-free MoS 2  negative capacitance FETs (NCFETs) using ferroelectric HtZrO x (HZO) as gate dielectric, achieving sub-60m V/dec subthreshold slope (SS) over 6 orders of I D , minimum SS of 24 mV/dec and 10 7  on/off ratio under  $V_{dd}=0.5mathrm{V}$ . We further study the high frequency performance and show that sub-60mV/dec is maintained at least to 10 kHz without signs of degradation. Finally, by performing different gate sweeps we conclude that the steep slope is indeed due to NC effects rather than ferroelectric switching of HZO.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we report, for the first time, that surface roughness scattering is not necessarily the dominant scattering mechanism in the high-normal-field region of Ge nMOSFETs. This statement is quite different from the well-recognized situation in Si MOSFETs. In Ge(100), phonon scattering is dominant in the high-field region. Thus, it is difficult to increase the high-normal-field mobility in Ge(100) nMOSFETs by controlling the interface roughness. In contrast, because Ge(111) and Ge(110) are free of intervalley phonon scattering, the high-field mobility in Ge(111) and Ge(110) nMOSFETs could be enhanced by the Ge interface engineering. Furthermore, different from that in Si nMOSFETs, mobility limited by surface roughness scattering in Ge nMOSFETs shows a strong temperature dependence due to the valley occupancy change of electrons. The results in this paper should facilitate efforts to increase the high-normal-field mobility in Ge nMOSFETs.",

        "abstract": "Positive Bias Temperature Instability (PBTI) and Hot Carrier Injection (HCI) characterizations on InGaAs-On Insulator (OI) back gate nMOSFETs are presented and the degradation mechanism is discussed. Devices with two ultra-thin body thickness (15 nm and 8 nm) but same buried oxide (BOX) (15 nm) are investigated from a reliability perspective. Independent of the body thickness, the PBTI stress shows stronger impact on device performance than the HCI stress. Although the thinner body transistor exhibits a lower \u201coff\u201d current, it subjects to more severe degradations under both PBTI and HCI stresses. Pulsed HCI experiments confirmed that the self-heating effect (SHE) compounds the reliability challenge in ultra-thin body InGaAs-OI nMOSFETs. Additionally, it is also found that the different evolutions of the threshold voltage and the saturation current of the UTB InGaAs-OI nMOSFETs may be due to the slow border traps in the oxide.",

Photoelectric properties of the monocrystalline SiNWs are improved greatly with the formation of the nanostructure on the silicon wafers. By controlling the hydrogen peroxide concentration in the etching solution, SiNWs with different morphologies and surface characteristics are obtained. A reasonable mechanism of the etching process was proposed. Photocatalytic experiment shows that SiNWs prepared by 20% H2O2 etching solution exhibit the best activity in the decomposition of the target organic pollutant, Rhodamine B (RhB), under Xe arc lamp irradiation for its appropriate Si nanowire density with the effect of Si content and contact area of photocatalyst and RhB optimized.",

        "abstract": "Gold nanospheres (AuNSs) were partly embedded into silicon through metal-assisted chemical etching, producing multiple-dimensional coupling of the plasmon resonances with the induced image charges in the surrounding medium. Rich plasmonic features of such coupling system were revealed by single particle dark-field scattering spectra, characterizing by two splitted multipolar resonances at short wavelength region and a mixed dipolar resonance extending to infrared region. Numerical electrodynamic calculations indicated that the multipolar modes arise from the in-plane and out-of-plane quadrupolar resonances, which are excited by the horizontal and verticle electric field components, respectively, of the incident light owing to the enhanced coupling interaction. As the embedding depth increases, the degree of symmetry breaking in such nanoparticles/substrate system changes, resulting in significantly modified optical response, which supplies a new way to modulate the optical properties of plasmonic nanoparticles.",

We compared the dynamics of soil microbial biomass C with high (225.0 kg N hm -2) and low (150 kg N hm -2) application rate of chemical fertilizer N exposed to the elevated CO 2, O 3, CO 2 plus O 3 and CK after the spring wheat growing season in 2010. The results showed that under elevated CO 2 concentration at the jointing stage, high application rate of chemical fertilizer N significantly declined the amount of soil microbial biomass C by 64.97%, compared with the low N application rate of chemical fertilizer N (p<0.01). In treatment with low application rate of chemical fertilizer N, elevated O 3 concentration significantly declined the amount of soil microbial biomass C by 52.49% (p<0.05), compared with CK. In treatment with high application rate of chemical fertilizer N, the interaction of CO 2 and O 3 increased significantly the amount of soil microbial biomass C by 50.03% (p<0.05), compared with CK. At the ripening stage, under elevated CO 2 concentration and interaction of CO 2 and O 3, high application rate of chemical fertilizer N significantly decreased the amount of soil microbial biomass C by 32.92% and 41.45%, compared with low N application rate of chemical fertilizer N, respectively (p<0.05). In treatment with low application rate of chemical fertilizer N, elevated CO 2 and interaction of CO 2 and O 3 significantly increased the amount of soil microbial biomass C by 25.32% and 38.59% (p<0.05), compared with CK, respectively. \u00a9 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

The total organic carbon (TOC) and LF-C were significantly higher (P \u2264 0.05) in the virgin soils than in the cultivated soils. The LF-C in aggregates of different size classes varied from 0.9 to 2.5 g kg-1 in the cultivated soils and from 2.5 to 7.1 g kg-1 in the virgin soils, whereas the ratio of LF-C to TOC varied from 1.9% to 7.3% and from 5.0% to 12.2%, respectively. After being incubated under constant temperature and controlled humidity for three months, the contribution of LF-C to TOC sharply decreased to an amount (1.7%-8.5%) close to the level in soils that had been cultivated for 20 to 25 years (1.3%-8.8%). As a result, the larger water-stable macro-aggregates (especially > 1 mm) decreased sharply, indicating that the LF-C pool in virgin soils declined quickly after cultivation, which reduced the water stability of soil aggregates. \u00a9 2007 Soil Science Society of China.",

Over 60 percents of the pollution loading was distributed in the Liaohe River mainstream area, and the pollution intensities were stronger in Hunhe River downstream and Liaohe River stem downstream plain sub-basins in Central-Western Liaoning province than in Hunhe River upstream and Taizihe hilly sub-basins in eastern Liaoning province. \u00a9 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "A pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of nitrogen (N) fertilizer and maize straw incorporation on the accumulation of NH 4 +- 15N and NO 3 -- 15N in soil inorganic N pool among three consecutive cropping cycles, aimed to search for an effective N management practice to decrease superfluous accumulation of soil inorganic N and fertilizer N losses. The results showed that the amounts of soil NH 4 +- 15N, NO 3 -- 15N and inorganic 15N, and their percent to applied 15N-labeled fertilizer declined significantly with sampling time (p \u2264 0.001). Compared to low N application rate (44.64 mg N kg -1 soil), high N application rate (89.28 mg N kg -1 soil) enhanced significantly the amounts of soil NH 4 +- 15N, NO 3 -- 15N and inorganic 15N by 238.6%, 132.9% and 197.3%, respectively (p \u2264 0.001). In contrast, maize straw addition declined significantly the amounts of soil NH 4 +- 15N and inorganic 15N by 21.4% and 16.1% compared to without maize straw (p \u2264 0.001). The results suggested that a combined application of chemical fertilizer and maize straw with a wide C/N ratio is an important means for reducing the superfluous accumulation of fertilizer N as soil inorganic N to subsequently lower its loss.",

        "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) fertilizer prices rose more than 150\u00a0% in the past two decades, thus periodic P fertilization (purchasing and applying superphosphate periodically) could be economically beneficial to small-holder farmers. Still, it is necessary to determine if periodic P fertilization could sustain corn production compared to annual P fertilization. Corn (Zea mays L.) obtains P for its growth and development from soil solution, which is replenished by soil P fractions associated with the soil minerals (inorganic P, Pi) and organic matter (organic P, Po). It is expected that P fertilization regimes (annual vs. periodic applications) will influence the concentration of soil P fractions contributing to corn P nutrition. The objective of the study was to evaluate soil Pi and Po fractions and P uptake in corn agroecosystems of Northeast China under two fertilizer regimes: triple-superphosphate applied annually at 0, 25 or 75\u00a0kg\u00a0P\u00a0ha\u22121, or applied periodically (once every 6\u00a0years) as 150 or 450\u00a0kg\u00a0P\u00a0ha\u22121. During the two 6-year periods (1997\u20132002 and 2003\u20132008), both periodic and annual triple-superphosphate application significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increased the NaHCO3-Pi (93\u2013453\u00a0%), NaOH-Pi (44\u2013135\u00a0%) and HCl-Pi (11\u201345\u00a0%) fractions, thus sustaining crop P requirements. Although annual P fertilization gave 35\u00a0% more NaHCO3-Pi, 28\u00a0% more NaOH-Pi, 15\u00a0% greater HCl-Pi and 4\u00a0% more crop P uptake at the end of each 6-year period, there was no significant difference in corn yield. Therefore, periodic P application (once in 6\u00a0years) is recommended as an economical practice that could lower the cost of P fertilization for small-holder farmers producing corn in Northeast China.",

In this paper, an enrichment experiment with open-top chamber was conducted to examine the effects of elevated CO, O, and their combination on the contents of total phenolic compounds and flavone in the leaves of spring wheat (C crop) and maize (C crop). The results showed for spring wheat, the total phenolic contents in its leaves at jointing stage was significantly higher under elevated CO and/or O, with the sequence of CO plus O\u00a0>\u00a0O\u00a0>\u00a0CO\u00a0> ambient, while at grain-filling stage, the total phenolic content was lower under CO plus O than under CO, O, and ambient. The total phenolic content in maize leaves at jointing stage had the similar variation trend with that for wheat, but at grain-filling stage, the total phenolic content was slightly affected by elevated CO and/or O. The flavone content in spring wheat leaves was significantly lower under CO and/or O stress at jointing stage, but had lesser difference at grain-filling stage under the stress. The same variation trend was observed in the flavone content in maize leaves at jointing and grainfilling stages, i.e., CO plus O\u00a0>\u00a0CO\u00a0> ambient\u00a0> O.

        "abstract": "A 65-day field experiment was conducted to select cadmium (Cd)-safe genotypes (CSGs) among 21 Chinese cabbage genotypes in a low Cd-contaminated soil (0.66\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121). Seven CSGs were identified based on their Cd tolerance, shoot Cd concentrations, Cd enrichment factors (EFs), and translocation factors (TFs). Then, Beijingxin3, a typical CSG, together with Qiuxiang, a typical non-CSG for comparison, was selected for a subsequent 80-day field micro-plot experiment under four levels of Cd stress to evaluate the reliability of CSG screening and the role of organic acids in Cd accumulation and tolerance. Beijingxin3 was confirmed to be safe to grow in soil with Cd level up to 3.39\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121, with Cd accumulation in its shoots well below the permitted level, and Qiuxiang was still poor in tolerating low Cd stress (1.31\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121). With increasing the Cd stress, Cd accumulation and citrate concentrations increased in shoots and roots of both genotypes, and oxalate concentrations increased significantly in Beijingxin3 roots. Both oxalate and citrate concentrations were significantly positively related to Cd accumulation for Beijingxin3 roots. High accumulation in oxalate and citrate induced by Cd stress in Beijingxin3 roots could benefit its internal tolerance to long-term Cd stress with more Cd accumulation in its roots and less Cd accumulation in its shoots.",

        "abstract": "Applications of cadmium (Cd) and salinity-containing manures contribute to Cd pollution and salinization in greenhouse soils. In this study, chicken manure polluted with Cd (5.6\u00a0mg/kg) was mildly electrokinetically treated (0.25\u00a0V/cm) for 48\u00a0h with intermittent replacement of catholyte with 20\u00a0mM acetic acid solution to remove Cd and salinity for application without need of post-treatment in greenhouse soil. The electrokinetic treatment created pH conditions mainly ranging from 5.0 to 8.0 within the manure for minimizing re-precipitation of desorbed Cd and evaporative loss of ammonium. However, without manure pre-acidification, electrokinetic treatment resulted in negligible removal of total Cd but 61.7% of increase in the small fraction of exchangeable Cd, due to poor desorption but enhanced formation of exchangeable Cd. In contrast, manure pre-acidification with 20\u00a0mM acetic acid favored Cd desorption, leading to electrokinetic removal of exchangeable, carbonate-bound, and total Cd by 32.2%, 34.5%, and 14.5%, respectively. Mild electrokinetic treatment of manure with and without pre-acidification resulted in similar removal of salinity (72.3% and 68.0%), similar pH condition (7.2 and 7.4), and basically same evaporative loss of ammonium (14.6% and 14.2%). Overall, the mild electrokinetic treatment considerably lowered the risk of Cd and the salinity from the pre-acidified manure for improved applicability in greenhouse soil, and more studies are needed to enhance the performance of electrokinetic Cd removal from manure.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   As labile fraction of soil organic matter, soil carbohydrates are sensitive to environmental changes due to their high turnover rates. The effects of elevated O 3  and CO 2  on the concentration and composition of soil carbohydrates in agroecosystems have been rarely studied. The present experiment was conducted to investigate the dynamics of the concentration and composition of neutral sugars in soil under the influence of elevated O 3  and CO 2  with different N application rates (150\u00a0kg\u00a0N\u00a0ha \u22121  and 225\u00a0kg\u00a0N\u00a0ha \u22121 ). Our results showed that elevated O 3  decreased soil carbohydrate accumulation, with the effect being more pronounced with high than with low N application rate. Elevated O 3  significantly increased the ratio of (mannose\u00a0+\u00a0galactose)/(arabinose\u00a0+\u00a0xylose), indicating that elevated O 3  promoted the relative contribution of microbe-derived carbohydrates to soil organic matter (SOM). The high N application rate further increased the contribution of microbe-derived carbohydrates to SOM under elevated O 3  conditions. However, elevated CO 2  had no effect on soil carbohydrate accumulation and little effects on carbohydrate composition in the study soil, regardless of N application rates. The elevated O 3 -induced effects were not altered by elevated CO 2  at the low N application rate, and the change in composition mediated by elevated CO 2  was observed only at the high N application rate. Our results suggest that elevated O 3  affected soil carbohydrate accumulation and their composition and that the effects on composition were mediated by elevated CO 2  and N application rates.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Nitrogen derived from rhizodeposition (NdfR) is an important N source both for the current and subsequent crops in soil-plant system. However, few studies have focused on the effects of elevated O 3  concentration on NdfR and its availability to subsequent crops. A pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of elevated O 3  on spring wheat NdfR and its availability to buckwheat in open-top chambers (OTCs), where spring wheat was labeled with  15 N urea by using a split-root method under ambient (Control; CK) and two O 3  concentration-elevated conditions (60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05 and 110\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05 nmol mol \u22121 , respectively), and buckwheat was cultivated in the soil contained rhizodeposited  15 N compounds after spring wheat harvest. The results showed that O 3  stress significantly decreased the quantity of spring wheat  15 N rhizodeposition ( 15 NdfR) by 24\u201348% compared to CK. Spring wheat  15 NdfR accounted for on average 8\u201315% of the total plant  15 N ( 15 N assimilation in plant material\u00a0+ 15 NdfR; T 15 N), and 78\u201395% of the total belowground parts of plant  15 N (root  15 N\u00a0+ 15 NdfR; BGP- 15 N) during plant growth. N recovery of buckwheat plant accounted for 12\u201325% of spring wheat  15 N deposited into soil, and was significantly decreased by approximately one half under the two O 3  level-elevated conditions. These results indicate that N rhizodeposition represents a significant pool in N dynamics of soil-plant system, and the projected future O 3  concentration might induce adverse effects on NdfR and its availability to subsequent crops to influence N transformation and cycling in soil-plant system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Iron can stimulate cyanobacterial growth. Determining iron availability to cyanobacteria is therefore essential for timely warnings of bloom development. The objectives of this study were to determine the key spectral parameters indicating cellular iron status in cyanobacteria and to establish reliable equations for estimating iron nutrition in cyanobacterial cells. Cells, pigments, cellular iron, and spectra of cyanobacteria were measured monthly at 17 sites in Meiliang Bay of Taihu Lake during the summer period of cyanobacterial blooms from 2010 to 2013. Pronounced spatial and temporal variability of cellular iron of cyanobacteria was observed. The previously developed structure-insensitive pigment index ( SIPI ) and plant senescence reflectance index ( PSRI ) and the newly proposed chlorophyll  a /phycocyanin index ( R  Chl/PC ) exhibited strong relationships with cyanobacterial cellular iron content. The relationships between the cellular iron concentration and  SIPI ,  PSRI  and  R  Chl/PC  could be expressed as linear, quadratic and cubic functions, respectively. The equations derived herein were tested using independent data from 2008 to 2009, obtained from 31 sites within Taihu Lake. For the three models that included  SIPI ,  PSRI  and  R  Chl/PC  as predictors, the coefficients of determination ( R  2 ) between the measured and estimated cellular iron concentration were 0.549, 0.584 and 0.909, and the mean relative errors ( RE ) were 17.1%, 18.1% and 8.0%, respectively. The overall results indicated that use of the three key hyperspectral parameters,  SIPI ,  PSRI  and  R  Chl/PC , could be used for non-destructive and real-time monitoring of the iron nutritional status of cyanobacteria-dominant algal blooms in eutrophic lakes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The screening of sensitive spectral indictors is essential for quantitative diagnosis of ozone (O 3 )-induced stress in plants. Four wheat ( Triticum aestivum  L.) cultivars with different degrees of O 3 -tolerance were grown under an elevated O 3  concentration (E-O 3 ) in fully open-air field conditions for two consecutive growth seasons from 2012 to 2013. The aim was to find sensitive hyperspectral indictors for real-time detection of O 3  effects. The results showed that E-O 3  caused a significant decrease in leaf thickness and pigment concentrations, resulting in a change in leaf reflectance. The effects of E-O 3  on both physiological variables and reflectance characteristics were wheat cultivar-specific, with a greater and earlier O 3  effect found in the O 3 -sensitive wheat cultivars than in the O 3 -tolerant cultivars. Spectral indices that were previously developed to detect leaf biological variables were examined, and highly correlated relations were found between the chlorophyll content and the three spectral parameters  ND  705 ,  mND  705  and  R  550 , with Pearson  r  values of 0.896, 0.892 and \u2212\u00a00.872, respectively. When independently determined data from 2013 were used to test the derived equations, the coefficients (R 2 ) of correlation between the measured and estimated chlorophyll were 0.817 ( ND  705 ), 0.833 ( mND  705 ) and 0.776 ( R  550 ); the root mean square errors (RMSE) were 0.227 ( ND  705 ), 0.228 ( mND  705 ) and 0.254 ( R  550 ) (mg\u00a0kg \u2212\u00a01 ); and the mean relative errors (RE) were 8.7% ( ND  705 ), 8.1% ( mND  705 ) and 9.1% ( R  550 ). Furthermore, O 3 -induced changes in the three optical parameters were in accordance with the leaf chlorophyll responses in wheat. Our study suggested that the reflectance indices  mND  705 ,  ND  705  and  R  550 , especially the former two spectral indices that contained information from several bands, could help to support the diagnosis and real-time monitoring of O 3 -induced damage in wheat. To estimate the wheat yield accurately using the selected spectral indices, the filling stage was found to be the best time for measuring canopy reflectance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Few studies have investigated the extractable organic nitrogen (EON) formation mechanisms, and the sources of EON have long been debated. Using  15 N labeling, we performed a 120-day laboratory incubation experiment to explore the dynamic contributions of different types of added N (ammonium-N, ryegrass-N and their combination) to soil EON and the role that microorganisms play in N transformation into EON. We show that the  15 N abundances and recoveries in soil EON pool were relatively low during the incubation, except the first hours after ryegrass addition in  15 N-ryegrass addition treatments. In general, most of the EON during the incubation was soil derived, and both ammonium-N (80\u202fmg\u202fkg \u22121 ) and ryegrass-N (160\u202fmg\u202fkg \u22121 ) additions made minor contributions (3\u20134% and 8\u201313% during day 1\u2013120) to the soil EON pool. Moreover, along with the decline in  15 N recoveries in microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) pool, the lost MB 15 N did not enter into the EO 15 N pool. Our study demonstrates 1) that EON is a stable N pool in agricultural soil and is less affected by exogenous N addition and 2) that microbial N uptake and release processes contribute little to the soil EON pool.",

In this study, the effectiveness of adding sucrose as available carbon through irrigation to cut nitrate excess in lettuce-planted soil was investigated under impacts of soil texture and irrigation type. In the pot experiment using two loam soils of same origin with different clay to sand ratios (50.2% and 39.8%) and nitrate excess (116.1 and 417.7\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0N), three-time sucrose addition through flood irrigation was more effective in lowering net formation of nitrate-based inorganic N and increasing lettuce yield in the soil with the higher clay to sand ratio, and sucrose addition at 150-450\u00a0mg/kg reduced nitrate accumulation and leaching, and nitrate content of lettuce at harvest by 62.5-89.6%, 19.3-36.1%, and 11.4-76.0%, respectively. In the micro-plot field experiment with two-time sucrose addition at 0.6-1.2\u00a0g/L through furrow irrigation (42\u00a0mm) into two other soils of same origin with different clay to sand ratios (56.9%, 48.4%), nitrate accumulation at 0-30-cm depth at the prone-leaching furrow location at harvest decreased by 30.9-36.0% under the higher clay to sand ratio but increased by about 35% under the lower clay to sand ratio. The nitrate content and yield of ridge-planted lettuce was less affected in either soil. Hence, carbon addition rate, irrigation type, and clay to sand ratio all affected the effect of available carbon addition on nitrate accumulation in vegetable-planted soil, and their joint impacts need better quantification for cutting nitrate excess in soil and improving vegetable quality and even yield.",

How LMWOAs may modify P sorption in soils with contrasting pH is not well understood, much less the mechanisms involved. The effects of three common LMWOAs (oxalic, citric, and malic acids) on P sorption in calcareous, neutral, and acidic soils were studied in batch experiments, followed by sequential P fractionation to elucidate the mechanisms whereby LMWOAs alter P sorption. The sorption data of the three soils fitted better to the Freundlich equation (r2\u2009=\u20090.325\u20130.994, P\u2009u003c\u20090.05) than the Langmuir and linear equations. Oxalic, citric, and malic acids at 10\u00a0mmol\u00a0kg\u22121 soil decreased the Freundlich P sorption parameters Kf and n, which represent P sorption capacity and energy, due to the fact that LMWOAs reduced P sorption in NaHCO3-Pi (soil soluble and exchangeable Pi, 23.8\u201330.9%) and NaOH-P...",

The results showed that the leaching loss of total P in the leachates elevated with the increment of leaching time while the accumulative leaching loss of total P was relatively low, indicating P was mainly accumulated in the soil instead of in the leachate. At the end of the leaching experiment, soil fertility and fertilization treatment affected the content of total phosphorus and Olsen-P significantly. Compared with the low-level-fertility soil, the contents of total P and Olsen-P increased by 14.3% and 12.2% in the medium-level-fertility soil, 33.3% and 37.7% in the high-level-fertility soil. Total P in the combined application of poultry manure and chemical fertilizer (M+NPK) was elevated by 5.7% and 4.3%, compared with the NPK and M treatment. Compared with NPK treatment, Olsen-P in M and M + NPK treatments augmented by 13.0% and 3.1%, respectively. Soil total P and Olsen-P mainly accumulated in the 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm soil layers, and much less in the 20-40 cm soil layer.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The transformation and fate of fertilizer N applied to soil is particularly important for increasing N retention in soil-crop systems and minimizing N loss from agroecosystems. However, it is obscure how the transformation and fate of fertilizer N will be affected by N input rates and crop residue amendment. In present study, an outdoor experiment was conducted in Mollisols of Northeast China throughout three crop cultivations using  15 N-labeled tracer techniques to evaluate the effects of N fertilization levels and maize straw application on the conversion of applied fertilizer N to newly synthesized organic N, recently fixed NH 4  + , and mineral N in soil-crop systems. Generally, six treatments were set up: no N fertilization (CK), application of only maize straw (M, 16.49\u202fmg\u202fN kg \u22121  soil), low N input levels (N 1 , 44.64\u202fmg\u202fN kg \u22121  soil), N 1  plus maize straw (N 1 +M, 61.13\u202fmg\u202fN kg \u22121  soil), high N input levels (N 2 , 89.28\u202fmg\u202fN kg \u22121  soil), and N 2  plus maize straw (N 2 +M, 105.77\u202fmg\u202fN kg \u22121  soil). The results showed that the majority of applied fertilizer N was rapidly transformed into newly synthesized organic N, followed by recently fixed NH 4  + . Compared with the N 1  and/or N 2  treatments, maize straw amendment in the N 1 +M and N 2 +M treatments significantly increased the residual amount of applied fertilizer N in soil by accelerating the conversion of fertilizer N to newly synthesized organic N or recently fixed NH 4  + . Among three crop cultivations, the percentages of recovery of applied fertilizer N in crops (PR-N crop ) and in soil (PR-N soil ) were averagely 61.1% and 15.8%, respectively, while the percentage of N loss (PL-N) was 23.1%. Applying maize straw significantly elevated the PR-N crop  and PR-N soil  but decreased the PL-N compared to those without maize straw. These results suggested that the application of maize straw with high C/N ratio is important to retain applied fertilizer N in soil-crop systems. Balancing carbon and nitrogen inputs in soil through proper combination of fertilizer N and maize straw will be a potentially practical management to increase fertilizer N recovery in crop and soil, and therefore reduce fertilizer N loss from crop-soil systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The accumulation and availability of soil organic nitrogen (N), especially amino acid N, is highly important for N retention in the soil and N supply for crop growth. However, it remains obscure how the conversion of fertilizer N to both soil organic N and amino acid N is affected by management practices such as fertilization and residue amendment. In present study, we conducted an outdoor  15 N labeling pot experiment in Mollisols of Northeast China, where plants were consecutively cropped after each of three cultivations (spring wheat-buckwheat-spring wheat). We aimed to evaluate the effects of maize straw applications on the dynamics of organic N and amino acid N derived from fertilizer N. Six treatments were set: no N fertilization (CK), application of only maize straw (M), low N levels (N 1 ), N 1  plus maize straw (N 1 \u202f+\u202fM), high N levels (N 2 ), and N 2  plus maize straw (N 2 \u202f+\u202fM). The results showed that organic N and amino acid N dominated the available N derived from fertilizer N, but their contents decreased significantly as crop cultivation continued. Compared with N 2 , N 2 \u202f+\u202fM, which involved the application of maize straw, significantly increased the content of organic N derived from fertilizer N by an average of 20.1% during the first crop cultivation. Compared with N 1  and N 2 , N 1 \u202f+\u202fM and N 2 \u202f+\u202fM promoted the content of fertilizer-derived amino acid N by an average of 12.5% across five sampling dates. During the first crop cultivation, straw amendment also significantly increased both plant uptake and soil residues of fertilizer N in N 1 \u202f+\u202fM and N 2 \u202f+\u202fM. Our results demonstrated that substrate amendments such as crop residues may constitute a practical agricultural management approach for promoting the transformation of fertilizer N to soil organic N, thereby increasing both fertilizer N use efficiency and retention in our study crop-soil systems.",

The aim of the present study was to analyze  mutation in a Chinese family with LCDI, and to describe the clinical features and phenotype-genotype correlation within this family. Three generations of this family with LCDI were enrolled in the current study. Complete ophthalmic examinations were performed on all family members and mutation screenings of the coding regions of  were analyzed using a direct sequencing method. All family members underwent slit-lamp examination, and two patients and one of normal members in the family were evaluated by laser scanning  confocal microscopy. A single heterozygous c.370C>T (p.R124C) mutation was identified in exon 4 of the  gene in five affected individuals, but not in the other family members and 400 normal control subjects. The affected members exhibited similar clinical features of LCDI, except that patient III:5 presented with mild symptoms. Confocal microscopy  examination demonstrated that the proband (II:2) and his affected niece (III:4) had disruptions in multiple corneal layers, including the basal epithelial cells, stroma cells and Bowman's membrane. Thus, the R124C mutation in the  gene was identified in a Chinese family with LCDI. These results characterized the clinical features and revealed a genotype-associated phenotype in this family, which may contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of LCDI.",

This study aimed to identify gene mutations responsible for autosomal dominant congenital cataract (ADCC) in a Chinese family using next-generation sequencing technology. This family included eight unaffected and five affected individuals. After complete ophthalmic examinations, the blood samples of the proband and two available family members were collected. Then the whole exome sequencing was performed on the proband and Sanger sequencing was applied to validate the causal mutation in the two family members and control samples. After the whole exome sequencing data were filtered through a series of existing variation databases, a heterozygous mutation c.499T<G (p.E167X) in  gene was found. And the results showed that the mutation cosegregated with the disease phenotype in the family and was absolutely absent in 1000 ethnicity-matched control samples. Thus, the heterozygous mutation c.499T<G (p.E167X) in  was the causal mutation responsible for this ADCC family. In conclusion, our findings revealed a novel stopgain mutation c.499T<G (p.E167X) in the exon 6 of  which expanded the mutation spectrum of  in Chinese congenital cataract population and illustrated the important role of  in the genetics research of congenital cataract.",

        "abstract": "Intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor for glaucoma. Genetic determinants of intraocular pressure can provide critical insights into the genetic architecture of glaucoma and, as a result, open new avenues for therapeutic intervention. We performed a genome-wide association study and replication analysis of 8,552 Chinese participants. In the genome-wide association study, we identified 51 loci that surpassed the significance of P<9\u00d710, and we formally replicated these loci. A combined discovery and replication meta-analysis identified 21 genome-wide loci that surpassed the genome-wide significance of P<5\u00d710, including 4 previously reported loci: rs145063132 (7p21.2, ETV1/DGKB), rs548030386 (7q31.2, ST7 near CAV1/CAV2), rs7047871 (9p24.2, GLIS3), and rs2472494 (9q31.1, ABCA1/SLC44A1). Of the 17 newly identified loci, five were reported to have ocular related phenotypes: PTCH2 (rs7525308 in 1p34.1), LRIF1/DRAM2 (rs1282146 in 1p13.3), COLEC11 (rs201143466 in 2p25.3), SPTBN1 (rs4514918 in 2p16.2), and CRK (rs11078446 in 17p13.3). The genetic loci identified in this study not only increase our understanding of the genes involved in intraocular pressure but also provide important genetic markers to improve future genetic screening and drug discovery for intraocular pressure disorders.",

However, genetic association between these two genes and high myopia remains inconsistent in different studies. This study was conducted to investigate the association between IGF1and IGF1R and high myopia in a Han Chinese population. Methods: Fourteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IGF1 and IGF1R genes were genotyped by SNaPshot method in a Han Chinese subject group composed of 1244 high myopia patients and 1380 controls. The genotyping data was analyzed by \u03c72 test and the linkage disequilibrium block structure was examined by Haploview software. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in the allele frequencies of IGF1 and IGF1R SNPs and genotypes between patients and controls after Bonferroni multiple-correction (p u003e 0.05). However, the G allele of rs35766 in the IGF1 gene showed a protective...",

        "abstract": "Congenital cataract is the most common cause of the visual disability and blindness in childhood. This study aimed to identify gene mutations responsible for autosomal dominant congenital cataract (ADCC) in a Chinese family using next-generation sequencing technology. This family included eight unaffected and five affected individuals. After complete ophthalmic examinations, the blood samples of the proband and two available family members were collected. Then the whole exome sequencing was performed on the proband and Sanger sequencing was applied to validate the causal mutation in the two family members and control samples. After the whole exome sequencing data were filtered through a series of existing variation databases, a heterozygous mutation c.499Tu003cG (p.E167X) in CRYBB2 gene was found. And the results showed that the mutation cosegregated with the disease phenotype in the family and was absolutely absent in 1000 ethnicity-matched control samples. Thus, the heterozygous mutation c.499Tu003cG (p.E167X) in CRYBB2 was the causal mutation responsible for this ADCC family. In conclusion, our findings revealed a novel stopgain mutation c.499Tu003cG (p.E167X) in the exon 6 of CRYBB2 which expanded the mutation spectrum of CRYBB2 in Chinese congenital cataract population and illustrated the important role of CRYBB2 in the genetics research of congenital cataract.",

        "abstract": "Recently, three large genome-wide association studies have identified multiple variants associated with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) near the ABCA1 gene. Considering that POAG and primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) share many similar clinical manifestations, the present study was conducted to investigate whether these genetic variants were also associated with PACG in a Han Chinese population.A case-control association study of 1122 cases (PACG/PAC) and 1311 normal, matched controls was undertaken. Seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the ABCA1 gene, including rs2422493, rs2487042, rs2472496, rs2472493, rs2487032, rs2472459, and rs2472519, were genotyped. Genotype and allele frequencies were assessed using \u03c7\u00b2 tests. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure was analyzed by computer software.Among the SNPs genotyped, no association was observed between these SNPs and PACG. However, we discovered that two haplotypes, CATTTAC (corrected P = 0.048) and CGCCCGC (corrected P = 0.048), remained significantly associated with PACG/PAC after Bonferroni correction. Subjects with the CATTTAC haplotype have a 1.71-fold increased possibility of having PACG/PAC, whereas subjects with the CGCCCGC haplotype have 0.47-fold decreased possibility of developing PACG.Our findings suggest that the genetic backgrounds of PACG and POAG might be different. However, whether or not ABCA1 plays a role in the development of PACG is still not made certain by this study. Thus, further research is needed to find the role of ABCA1 in the progress of PACG.",

        "abstract": ": Previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) has revealed the association between MYP10 at 8p23 and MYP15 at 10q21.1 and high myopia (HM) in a French population. This study is managed to discover the connection between some single nucleotide polymorphism (located at MYP10 and MYP15) and Han Chinese HM. : This case-control association study contained 1673 samples, including 869 ophthalmic patients and 804 controls. Twelve tag SNPs have been selected from the MYP10 and MYP15 loci and genotyped by SNaPshot method. Among 12 SNPs, rs4840437 and rs6989782 in  gene were found significant association with HM. Carriers of rs4840437G allele and rs4840437GG genotype created a low risk of high myopia (P = .036, OR = 0.81, 95%CI = 0.71-0.93; P = .016, OR = 0.73, 95%CI = 0.56-0.96; respectively). Carriers of rs6989782T allele and rs6989782TT+CT genotype also had a decreased risk of high myopia (P = .048, OR = 0.82, 95%CI = 0.71-0.94; P = .006, OR = 0.74, 95%CI = 0.59-0.92; respectively). Other 10 SNPs displaced nonsignificant association with HM. Additionally, the risk haplotype AC and the protective haplotype GT, generated by two SNPs in , were considerably more likely to be association with HM (for AC, P = .002 and OR = 1.26; for GT, P = .027 and OR = 0.84). : Our results demonstrated that some heritable variants in the  gene are associated with HM in the Han population. The possible functions of TNKS in the development and pathogenesis of hereditary high myopia still require further researches to identify.",

        "abstract": "The cystathionine \u03b2-synthase (CBS) gene has been shown to be related to homocystinuria. This study was aimed to detect the mutations in CBS in a Han Chinese family with homocystinuria. A four-generation family from Shandong Province of China was recruited in this study. All available members of the family underwent comprehensive medical examinations. Genomic DNA was collected from peripheral blood of all the participants. The coding sequence of CBS was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by direct DNA sequencing. Among all the family members, three affected individuals showed typical clinical features of homocystinuria. Two novel compound heterozygous mutations in the CBS gene, c.407T\u2009u003e\u2009C (p. L136P) and c.473C\u2009u003e\u2009T (p.A158V), were identified by sequencing analysis in this family. Both of the two missense mutations were detected in the three patients. Other available normal individuals, including the patients\u2019 parents, grand parents, her younger sister and brother in this family either carried one of the two mutations, or none. In addition, the two mutations were not found in 600 ethnically matched normal controls. This study provides a mutation spectrum of CBS resulting in homocystinuriain a Chinese population, which may shed light on the molecular pathogenesis and clinical diagnosis of CBS-associated homocystinuria.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of joint inference and optimization in wireless networks. An optimization framework based on information-geometric network inference is developed and implemented (using a real radio emulation testbed) with scalable solutions to infer the end-to-end rate distributions of stochastic network flows from link rate measurements. The proposed low-complexity solutions apply when the underlying network inference (network tomography) problem can be decomposed to smaller-size subproblems that are solved independently by partially inferring only the flow rates of interest. The solutions are extended to infer flow rates jointly with link loss rates when retransmissions are considered over unreliable wireless links. By using the inferred distributions of flow rates, an inference mechanism is presented to optimize the network performance. First, the distributions of flow rates are inferred from the average rate measurements on selected links. Then, the distributions of all links rates are computed from the inferred distributions of flow rates. Finally, these inference results are used with network optimization. The weighted sum of link outage probabilities is minimized by adapting power control or routing decisions in mobile wireless access. This approach is iterated between network inference and optimization, providing link outage and end-to-end throughput gains compared to static approaches with fixed network (inference and optimization) parameters. The joint network inference and optimization framework is implemented with real configurable radios and the performance is verified with hardware-in-the-loop emulation test results that are obtained with actual radio transmissions over emulated channels.",

Different levels of uncertainty are considered for the channel availability under SATCOM delays and jamming effects. Spectrum uncertainty is quantified regarding the parameter estimation for Markov model of spectrum occupancy and the prediction of future channel states under SATCOM delays. Based on these uncertainty models, the optimal spectrum sensing approach is used to identify available channels. Both offline and online algorithms are used for DSA. Offline algorithm first learns spectrum dynamics and then applies DSA, whereas online learning repeats this process and adapts to fast spectrum dynamics. Results show performance gains of DSA over the case without considering spectrum uncertainty.",

The objective is to maximize the aggregate performance of communication subscribers served by the airborne relay. The performance is measured as either the duty cycle in terms of signal-to-noise-ratio or the throughput achieved by communication subscribers. Both measures are computed with realistic channel, terrain, antenna and aircraft characteristics for ground-to-air and air-to-ground communications. Different methods to generate an airborne relay orbit are discussed with their parameters to optimize. Results are specialized to optimization of elliptical orbit parameters. First, an elliptical orbit is optimally selected with the best center and radius (in X and Y-directions) as orbit parameters subject to the specified altitude and speed of the aircraft. Both exhaustive search and gradient search with reduced complexity are considered to find the best set of orbit parameters. This elliptical orbit is then converted to an operational orbit by optimally selecting orbit waypoints and locating smooth turning points while minimizing the fuel consumption of the airborne relay. A software with interactive GUI is designed and implemented for force-level planning that allows the planner to select different properties of airborne relay and communication subscribers, and returns the optimal orbit for the airborne relay.",

        "abstract": "Spectrum is limited, but the demand for it is growing steadily with new users, applications, and services in both commercial and tactical communications. The current paradigm of static spectrum allocation cannot satisfy this demand, resulting in a congested, contested environment with poor spectrum efficiency. Tactical radios need to share spectrum with other in- and out-ofnetwork tactical and commercial radios, subject to potential jamming and other security attacks. Cognitive radio provides tactical communications with new means of spectrum sharing, cohabitation configurability, and adaptation to improve communication rates, connectivity, robustness, and situational awareness, all translated to network- centric mission success. A systematic solution to SDR programming and test and evaluation (Tu0026E) is needed to address spectrum challenges with the network-centric mission success set as the primary goal. Once equipped with cognitive radio capabilities, tactical radios can quickly and reliably discover the white-space and effectively use spectrum opportunities across time, space, and frequency. This article presents the design and implementation of a visual and modular radio software programming tool that supports easy, fast, and radio-agnostic development of cognitive radio and network protocols and security mechanisms. This tool is fully integrated with a unified Tu0026E framework that applies the same SDR solution to high fidelity simulation and emulation tests under a common, controllable, and repeatable scenario. This unified approach makes prototyping of cognitive radio capabilities with tactical radios faster, easier, and cost-effective.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to launch and defend against the causative and evasion attacks on machine learning classifiers. As the preliminary step, the adversary starts with an exploratory attack based on deep learning (DL) and builds a functionally equivalent classifier by polling the online target classifier with input data and observing the returned labels. Using this inferred classifier, the adversary can select samples according to their DL scores and feed them to the original classifier. In an evasion attack, the adversary feeds the target classifier with test data after selecting samples with DL scores that are close to the decision boundary to increase the chance that these samples are misclassified. In a causative attack, the adversary feeds the target classifier with training data after changing the labels of samples with DL scores that are far away from the decision boundary to reduce the reliability of the training process. Results obtained for text and image classification show that the proposed evasion and causative attacks can significantly increase the error during test and training phases, respectively. A defense strategy is presented to change a small number of labels of the original classifier to prevent its reliable inference by the adversary and its effective use in evasion and causative attacks. These findings identify new vulnerabilities of machine learning and demonstrate that a proactive defense mechanism can reduce the impact of the underlying attacks.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the joint design of network coding and backpressure algorithm for cognitive radio networks and its implementation with software-defined radios (SDRs) in a high fidelity network emulation testbed. The backpressure algorithm is known to provide throughput optimal solutions to joint routing and scheduling for dynamic packet traffic. This solution applies to cognitive radio networks with spectrum dynamics changing over time and space, and supports joint routing and spectrum access without any need for end-to-end path maintenance. The backpressure algorithm is extended to multicast traffic with network coding deployed over virtual queues that represent different flows per session and destination. This extension is supported with different methods to decode packets at destinations. In the absence of a common control channel, distributed coordination with local information exchange is used to support neighborhood discovery, spectrum sensing and channel estimation that are integrated with joint routing, channel access and network coding. Cognitive network functionalities are implemented with GNU Radio and Python modules for different network layers, and used with USRP N210 radios. Practical radio implementation issues are addressed in a distributed wireless network setting, where USRP N210 radios communicate with each other through RFnest, a high fidelity wireless network emulation tool. RFnest provides realistic physical channel environment by digitally controlling path loss, fading, delay, topology and mobility effects. Extensive emulation test results are provided to assess throughput, backlog and energy consumption and verify the SDR implementation of joint network coding and backpressure algorithm under realistic channel and radio hardware effects.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of routing in a multilayer (communication and social) network. Network protocols, such as link state routing and its variants, heavily used in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) cannot sustain robustness and efficiency as the topological information becomes easily stale with fast network dynamics. Attempts to collect and exchange excessive network information would result in significant overhead and would degrade the overall network performance. This paper presents the SCATE (Social-Cognitive Advancement at Tactical Edge) routing protocol that applies social-cognitive techniques to improve robustness and efficiency of a multilayer network with MANET communication and social links. In a distributed and decentralized setting with local information, nodes learn and update their distances to destinations using social-cognitive metrics and make routing decisions to minimize the end-to-end delay. The SCATE protocol is compared with Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) with and without social links. Stand-alone computer simulations and high fidelity simulation/emulation tests with CORE and EMANE are used to evaluate SCATE under different communication network (traffic and mobility) and social network effects. Results show that the SCATE protocol is a viable solution to MANET routing by substantially reducing the overhead and the end-to-end delay, and increasing the end-to-end delivery ratio for both unicast and multicast traffic.",

        "abstract": "An adversarial machine learning approach is introduced to launch jamming attacks on wireless communications and a defense strategy is presented. A cognitive transmitter uses a pre-trained classifier to predict the current channel status based on recent sensing results and decides whether to transmit or not, whereas a jammer collects channel status and ACKs to build a deep learning classifier that reliably predicts the next successful transmissions and effectively jams them. This jamming approach is shown to reduce the transmitter\u2019s performance much more severely compared with random or sensing-based jamming. The deep learning classification scores are used by the jammer for power control subject to an average power constraint. Next, a generative adversarial network is developed for the jammer to reduce the time to collect the training dataset by augmenting it with synthetic samples. As a defense scheme, the transmitter deliberately takes a small number of wrong actions in spectrum access (in form of a causative attack against the jammer) and therefore prevents the jammer from building a reliable classifier. The transmitter systematically selects when to take wrong actions and adapts the level of defense to mislead the jammer into making prediction errors and consequently increase its throughput.",

        "abstract": "Social connections among network nodes have been well investigated as an additional opportunity in network design (e.g., in routing strategies and trusted networking). This paper presents a paradigm shift that explores the design and performance analysis of combining social links jointly with communication links for message delivery in wireless networks. In a combined multi-layer social and communication network, communication links are based on conventional wireless technologies (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth) and social links are overlaid over a communication infrastructure (e.g., cellular network) that provides an alternative way for data transmission. The goal is to characterize the performance analytically when routing is designed by combining social and communication links. A distance discretization technique is applied to model the reliability and delay of message delivery. The analytical foundation is developed to analyze the end-to-end delay and success probability under various effects of persistent transmission, potential error in distance estimation, and mobility. Systematic routing strategies that employ network inference are then designed to improve the performance in different aspects, such as delivery delay, delivery success probability, and energy-saving. A network emulation testbed is implemented with actual radios and real-world social network datasets to measure the performance of a heterogeneous network with social and communication links. The results in this paper show that the integration of social links in wireless network routing as a multi-layer design leads to substantial performance improvement for delay and reliability of message delivery.",

Examples of airborne relays include aircrafts, such as the battlefield airborne communication node; unmanned aerial vehicles, such as Facebooku0027s Aquila; balloons, such as Google Project Loon; and nano/microsatellites. There are two integrated components of mission planning: 1) the subscriber planner (run on each subscriberu0027s radio, phone, or attached computer) that finds the optimal transmission scheme for each subscriber communicating to/through an airborne relay by accounting for realistic channel, traffic, and energy effects and 2) the orbit (force-level) planner (run at a centralized controller prior to deployment of the airborne relay) that optimally designs the orbit of an airborne relay to maximize the overall network performance. For a given orbit of an airborne relay, the subscriber planner combines channel measurement and prediction (by accounting for terrain, aircraft, and antenna effects) to calculate signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and link rate. Then, the subscriber planner decides when and at what rate to transmit while optimizing the expected throughput for uplink/relay communications. The subscriber planner is shown to significantly outperform random and SNR threshold-based transmissions. On the other hand, the orbit planner first selects the optimal parameters of an elliptical orbit to maximize the network performance measured by the subscriber planner. This elliptical orbit is converted to an operational orbit by optimally selecting waypoints and locating smooth turning points while minimizing the airborne relayu0027s fuel consumption. The orbit planner software with an interactive graphical user interface is implemented to return the optimal orbit for the airborne relay that optimizes the network performance measured by the subscriber planner.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning has been applied in wireless communications. In this paper, we consider the case that a cognitive transmitter senses the spectrum and transmits on idle channels determined by a machine learning algorithm. We then present an adversarial machine learning approach to launch a spectrum data poisoning attack. That is, an adversary learns the transmitteru0027s behavior and attempts to falsify the spectrum sensing data over the air by transmitting for a short period of time when the channel is idle to manipulate the input for the decision mechanism of the transmitter. The cognitive engine at the transmitter is a deep neural network model that predicts idle channels with minimum sensing error for data transmissions. The transmitter collects spectrum sensing data and uses it as the input to its machine learning algorithm. In the meantime, the adversary also builds a cognitive engine using another deep neural network model to predict when the transmitter will have a successful transmission based on its spectrum sensing data. The adversary then performs the over-the-air spectrum data poisoning attack, which aims to change the channel occupancy status from idle to busy when the transmitter is sensing, so that the transmitter is fooled into making incorrect transmit decisions. This attack is more energy efficient and harder to detect compared to jamming of data transmissions. We show that this attack is very effective and reduces the throughput of the transmitter substantially.",

        "abstract": "Wireless communication networks need to support high data rate, low power consumption and extended connectivity over long distances, which may not be feasible with point-to-point transmissions. This paper presents the distributed coherent group communication solution to achieve high power gain, which is in turn translated to improvements in communication range, power efficiency, reliability, and throughput performance. In a network of distant nodes, this multi-layer solution enables groups of communication nodes to coordinate with each other in a distributed manner to form transmitter and receiver clusters, and communicate with each other over long distances. For that purpose, the coherent beamforming protocol (optimized from the transmitter cluster to the receiver cluster) and the clustering protocol (based on the intra-cluster distance) are integrated to perform distributed coherent group communications that improve the power gain significantly relative to point-to-point communications. This solution is shown to outperform other benchmark combinations of beamforming and clustering protocols that are introduced in this paper. Results show that it becomes feasible to improve the network performance significantly with distributed coherent group communications by using the existing single-antenna communication nodes.",

        "abstract": "High frequency (HF) communications provide beyond line-of-sight (BLoS) links for robust and reliable delivery of critical messages over long distances. HF communications suffer from low data rates and are susceptible to highly dynamic HF channel effects. Wideband HF (WBHF) communication technologies aim to support higher throughput rates that can be achieved with higher bandwidth. While there has been progress in the design of WBHF technologies at the physical layer, there is a lack of network and transport layer solutions that can support WBHF communications with improved end-to-end network performance in terms of throughput, reliability, delay, and overhead. First, a high-fidelity WBHF network simulator is presented to implement, test, and evaluate network protocols under realistic HF channel conditions that show unique characteristics compared to other spectrum bands. The WBHF network simulator runs real packet traffic with the real network protocol stack on virtual HF radios. The integrated HF channel simulator models long, intermediate, and short time-scale HF channel effects. Second, routing is combined with packet-level coding to support reliable communications for unicast and multicast traffic while limiting the need for end-to-end feedback messages. To support interoperability with transmission control protocol (TCP) applications, a performance-enhancing proxy (PEP) is used to improve the throughput achieved with TCP for WBHF communications. These network solutions are evaluated with the high-fidelity WBHF network simulator and their feasibility to improve the WBHF network performance is demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "As online systems based on machine learning are offered to public or paid subscribers via application programming interfaces (APIs), they become vulnerable to frequent exploits and attacks. This paper studies adversarial machine learning in the practical case when there are rate limitations on API calls. The adversary launches an exploratory (inference) attack by querying the API of an online machine learning system (in particular, a classifier) with input data samples, collecting returned labels to build up the training data, and training an adversarial classifier that is functionally equivalent and statistically close to the target classifier. The exploratory attack with limited training data is shown to fail to reliably infer the target classifier of a real text classifier API that is available online to the public. In return, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based on deep learning is built to generate synthetic training data from a limited number of real training data samples, thereby extending the training data and improving the performance of the inferred classifier. The exploratory attack provides the basis to launch the causative attack (that aims to poison the training process) and evasion attack (that aims to fool the classifier into making wrong decisions) by selecting training and test data samples, respectively, based on the confidence scores obtained from the inferred classifier. These stealth attacks with small footprint (using a small number of API calls) make adversarial machine learning practical under the realistic case with limited training data available to the adversary.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an analytical model of a multi-layer (social-communication) network supported with on-the-fly learned and prior social-cognitive features. In this model, routing is formulated in a distributed setting where each node operating with local information only finds the next-hop node, among all social and mobile ad hoc network (MANET) communication link neighbors, whose normalized delay is the smallest. This approach minimizes the end-to-end delay and readily extends to optimize other metrics, e.g., success probability. Delay performance is analytically evaluated as a function of distance to the destination node, which is estimated in social-cognitive learning under two social-cognitive features, frequency of encounters and social pressure metric. Different mobility models (random waypoint and group) are considered for the communication topology and different graph models (uniform random or scale-free) are considered for the underlying social network. Analysis is provided for both infinite and finite node models with different levels of granularity. In addition, real social network data is used to evaluate the analysis. Results show that online learning can closely track the actual distances to the destination and the expected delay with learning is close to that with perfect knowledge of network dynamics, while it saturates with hop distance, implying that the small-world phenomenon is captured.",

Then, a distributed channel access protocol that leverages local information without any centralized scheduler is developed to select and activate MU-MIMO configurations with the maximum achievable sum rates depending on channel, interference, and traffic conditions.

        "abstract": "The paper presents a novel approach of spoofing wireless signals by using a general adversarial network (GAN) to generate and transmit synthetic signals that cannot be reliably distinguished from intended signals. It is of paramount importance to authenticate wireless signals at the PHY layer before they proceed through the receiver chain. For that purpose, various waveform, channel, and radio hardware features that are inherent to original wireless signals need to be captured. In the meantime, adversaries become sophisticated with the cognitive radio capability to record, analyze, and manipulate signals before spoofing. Building upon deep learning techniques, this paper introduces a spoofing attack by an adversary pair of a transmitter and a receiver that assume the generator and discriminator roles in the GAN and play a minimax game to generate the best spoofing signals that aim to fool the best trained defense mechanism. The output of this approach is two-fold. From the attacker point of view, a deep learning-based spoofing mechanism is trained to potentially fool a defense mechanism such as RF ingerprinting. From the defender point of view, a deep learning-based defense mechanism is trained against potential spooing attacks when an adversary pair of a transmitter and a receiver cooperates. The probability that the spooing signal is misclassified as the intended signal is measured for random signal, replay, and GAN-based spoofing attacks. Results show that the GAN-based spooing attack provides a major increase in the success probability of wireless signal spoofing even when a deep learning classifier is used as the defense.\n\n",

        "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in wireless networks is how to handle packet loss due to noise, interference, and dynamic channel effects, especially when there is no per-packet acknowledgement due to additional delay and potential loss of feedback packets. We design and implement a packet coding optimization scheme, applied at the source node, to enhance end-to-end transmission reliability in a lossy multi-hop network. Specifically, each source node transmits a file of packets to its destination node in the network where the end-to-end packet acknowledgement is not readily available because of the possible error or delay effects over multiple hops. By simply retransmitting packets, a source node cannot guarantee innovative packet arrivals at the destination node. Thus, we design an optimization scheme for adaptive packet coding applied at the source node to avoid transmitting redundant packets, thereby significantly improving the throughput, even for the case of a single unicast session. This scheme does not require any knowledge of network topology and can seamlessly operate with any routing or network coding protocol used at the intermediate relay nodes. We analyze the throughput properties of coded transmissions and verify the feasibility of performance gains via simulations. Then, we provide high fidelity emulation testbed results with real radio transmissions over emulated channels to evaluate the throughput gains. Without relying on end-to-end acknowledgment for each packet, we show that the adaptive packet coding optimization scheme can achieve significantly higher throughput than the retransmission scheme in lossy networks with unicast traffic.",

One promising approach is to switch some servers in a data center to the idle mode for saving energy while to keep a suitable number of servers in the active mode for providing timely service. In this paper, we design both online and offline algorithms for this problem. For the offline algorithm, we formulate data center management as a cost minimization problem by considering energy cost, delay cost (to measure service quality), and switching cost (to change servers\u2019s active/idle mode). Then, we analyze certain properties of an optimal solution which lead to a dynamic programming based algorithm. Moreover, by revising the solution procedure, we successfully eliminate the recursive procedure and achieve an optimal offline algorithm with a polynomial complexity. For the online algorithm, We design it by considering the worst case scenario for future workload. In simulation, we show this online algorithm can always provide near-optimal solutions.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a game theoretic solution for hierarchical spectrum sharing between primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs) in the presence of cognitive interferers. There exist several forms of uncertainty, including channel conditions, packet traffic, and spectrum occupancy of users across channels. This uncertainty is further aggravated by delays (such as propagation delays observed over satellite links) that make spectrum-efficient communication a challenging task. A robust game theoretic framework is developed for dynamic spectrum access (DSA) management over multiple channels. Cognitive functionalities employed in the game solution include selecting channels for data transmission and performing power control at each user to sustain target rates. By considering random utility functions, the game engine based on regret minimization provides low complexity and fast solutions compared to traditional game solutions based on expected utility maximization. Detailed numerical results with comparison to benchmark schemes (the ideal case and the random case where users have perfect or no knowledge on channel availability, respectively) are provided to show the effectiveness of robust game theory-enabled approach.",

This solution is decentralized and includes scheduling and routing of the MU-MIMO communication links that adapt to dynamic channel, interference, and traffic conditions. We start with analyzing the ergodic sum rates of MIMO multiple access channel (MAC) and interference channel (IC) configurations by considering the error, and overhead effects due to channel estimation (training) and quantization (feedback). By taking the practical considerations such as channel estimation, quantization error and in-network interference into account, we show the rate gain with an increasing number of antennas compared with single-input single-output (SISO) systems. Next, we present a distributed channel access protocol to select and activate MU-MIMO configurations with the maximum achievable sum rates using local information on channel, interference, and traffic conditions. Then, we extend this scheduling algorithm to routing via a cross-layer solution based on a decentralized version of the backpressure algorithm. After accounting for the control message overhead, we show that the proposed MU-MIMO scheduling and routing solution improves the stable throughput over the minimum distance routing based on frequency of encounters and single user MIMO communications in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) setting.",

        "abstract": "Since December 2013, at least three cases of human infections with H10N8 avian influenza virus have been reported in China, two of them being fatal. To investigate the epidemic potential of H10N8 viruses, we examined the receptor binding property of the first human isolate, A/Jiangxi-Donghu/346/2013 (JD-H10N8), and determined the structures of its haemagglutinin (HA) in complex with both avian and human receptor analogues. Our results suggest that JD-H10N8 preferentially binds the avian receptor and that residue R137-localized within the receptor-binding site of HA-plays a key role in this preferential binding. Compared with the H7N9 avian influenza viruses, JD-H10N8 did not exhibit the enhanced binding to human receptors observed with the prevalent H7N9 virus isolate Anhui-1, but resembled the receptor binding activity of the early-outbreak H7N9 isolate (Shanghai-1). We conclude that the H10N8 virus is a typical avian influenza virus.",

ZIKV is associated with fetal microcephaly and neurological complications, and countermeasures are needed to treat and prevent ZIKV infection. We report the isolation of 13 specific human monoclonal antibodies from a single patient infected with ZIKV. Two of the isolated antibodies (Z23 and Z3L1) demonstrated potent ZIKV-specific neutralization in vitro without binding or neutralizing activity against strains 1 to 4 of dengue virus, the closest relative to ZIKV. These two antibodies provided postexposure protection to mice in vivo. Structural studies revealed that Z23 and Z3L1 bound to tertiary epitopes in envelope protein domain I, II, or III, indicating potential targets for ZIKV-specific therapy. Our results suggest the potential of antibody-based therapeutics and provide a structure-based rationale for the design of future ZIKV-specific vaccines.",

        "abstract": "Summary  Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is associated with mutations in  NPC1  and  NPC2 , whose gene products are key players in the endosomal/lysosomal egress of low-density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol. NPC1 is also the intracellular receptor for Ebola virus (EBOV). Here, we present a 4.4\u00a0A structure of full-length human NPC1 and a low-resolution reconstruction of NPC1 in complex with the cleaved glycoprotein (GPcl) of EBOV, both determined by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy. NPC1 contains 13 transmembrane segments (TMs) and three distinct lumenal domains A (also designated NTD), C, and I. TMs 2\u201313 exhibit a typical resistance-nodulation-cell division fold, among which TMs 3\u20137 constitute the sterol-sensing domain conserved in several proteins involved in cholesterol\u00a0metabolism and signaling. A trimeric EBOV-GPcl binds to one NPC1 monomer through the domain\u00a0C. Our structural and biochemical characterizations provide an important framework for mechanistic understanding of NPC1-mediated intracellular cholesterol trafficking and Ebola virus infection.",

        "abstract": "The mechanistic basis for the progressive accumulation of Y135F Nef mutant viruses in the HIV-1-infected population remains poorly understood. Y135F viruses carry the 2F mutation within RW8 and RF10, which are two HLA-A\u221724:02-restricted superimposed Nef epitopes recognized by distinct and adaptable CD8+ T cell responses. We combined comprehensive analysis of the T cell receptor repertoire and cross-reactive potential of wild-type or 2F RW8- and RF10-specific CD8+ T cells with peptide-MHC complex stability and crystal structure studies. We find that, by affecting direct and water-mediated hydrogen bond networks within the peptide-MHC complex, the 2F mutation reduces both TCR and HLA binding. This suggests an advantage underlying the evolution of the 2F variant with decreased CD8+ T cell efficacy. Our study provides a refined understanding of HIV-1 and CD8+ T cell co-adaptation at the population level.",

Neutralizing antibodies targeting viral envelope (E) protein, provide protection against flaviviruses in vivo but can also promote virus infection by antibody-dependent enhancement when antibodies are weakly neutralizing or in subneutralizing concentrations. The molecular basis for antibody-mediated virus neutralization can be revealed by structural studies of monoclonal antibodies complexed with the E protein or virion. In addition, the flavivirus non-structural protein NS1 can also induce host antibody production, and some of these antibodies can provide protection against virus challenge. In this review, we summarize the known structures of flavivirus neutralizing or protective antibodies bound to their epitopes and describe the underlying molecular mechanisms. \u00a9 2016 IUBMB Life, 68(10):783\u2013791, 2016",

PD-1 signaling plays pivotal roles in tumor-driven T-cell dysfunction. In contrast to prior approaches to generate or boost tumor-specific T-cell responses, antibody-based PD-1/PD-L1 blockade targets tumor-induced T-cell defects and restores pre-existing T-cell function to modulate antitumor immunity. In this review, the fundamental knowledge on the expression regulations and inhibitory functions of PD-1 and the present understanding of antibody-based PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapies are briefly summarized. We then focus on the recent breakthrough work concerning the structural basis of the PD-1/PD-Ls interaction and how therapeutic antibodies, pembrolizumab targeting PD-1 and avelumab targeting PD-L1, compete with the binding of PD-1/PD-L1 to interrupt the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. We believe that this structural information will benefit the design and improvement of therapeutic antibodies targeting PD-1 signaling.",

Here, we present the crystal structures of ZIKV NS5 MTase in complex with an RNA cap analogue ( m7 GpppA) and the free NS5 RdRp. We have identified the conserved features of ZIKV NS5 MTase and RdRp structures that could lead to development of current antiviral inhibitors being used against flaviviruses, including dengue virus and West Nile virus, to treat ZIKV infection. These results should inform and accelerate the structure\u2010based design of antiviral compounds against ZIKV.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Accumulating evidence indicates that MERS-CoV originated from bat coronaviruses (BatCoVs). Previously, we demonstrated that both MERS-CoV and BatCoV HKU4 use CD26 as a receptor, but how the BatCoVs evolved to bind CD26 is an intriguing question. Here, we solved the crystal structure of the S1 subunit C-terminal domain of HKU5 (HKU5-CTD), another BatCoV that is phylogenetically related to MERS-CoV but cannot bind to CD26. We observed that the conserved core subdomain and those of other betacoronaviruses (betaCoVs) have a similar topology of the external subdomain, indicating the same ancestor of lineage C betaCoVs. However, two deletions in two respective loops located in HKU5-CTD result in conformational variations in CD26-binding interface and are responsible for the non-binding of HKU5-CTD to CD26. Combined with sequence variation in the HKU5-CTD receptor binding interface, we propose the necessity for surveilling the mutation in BatCoV HKU5 spike protein in case of bat-to-human interspecies transmission.",

        "abstract": "Development of vaccines against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)is yet a challenging problem worldwide. Since its discovery, scientistsand business experts have struggled to develop both protective andtherapeutic vaccines for over 30\u2005years. Vaccines have playedcentral roles in protection of multiple pathogens and smallpox hasbeen completely eliminated because of the application of vaccines.However, the development of HIV vaccine has long been a well-knownproblem worldwide. The focus of strategies in HIV vaccine developmenthas experienced from mainly the production of humoral immune response,then mainly cellular immune response, and recently stressing on bothhumoral and cellular immune responses. HIV vaccine development isstill one of the most challenging problems worldwide.   Though partial protection from RV144 has shown a glimmer of hopefor successful HIV vaccine development, our understanding of protectiveimmune against HIV infection remains less understood and successfulHIV vaccine development is yet full of uncertainties. Host immunesystem consists of both innate immunity and adaptive immunity. Cellularimmune, constituted by both CD4 +  and CD8 +  Tcells, and humoral immune responses have formed host adaptive immunesystem. T cells were found to be critical for control of disease progressionafter HIV infection. However, CD4 +  T cells are the maintarget of HIV infection, resulting the impairment of host immune responsesagainst HIV thereafter. Recent findings revealed that the functionalityof HIV specific T cell responses may contributed more to the controlof disease progression than responsive quantity. Additionally, multipleprotective T cell subpopulations have also been identified which providednew directions for future HIV vaccine development. In recent years,the identification and mechanism study of broadly neutralizing antibodiesin long-term nonprogressors (LTNPs) have dramatically promoted theprogression of structure-based reverse vaccinology. Preliminary studieshave shown promising protective efficacy in animal studies with HIVvaccines designed to produce mainly broadly neutralizing antibodies.The production of broadly neutralizing antibodies in LTNPs is a resultof long-term virus-host immune adaption. However, our knowledge abouthow do the broadly neutralizing antibodies developed in LTNPs is stilllimited, which has restricted the design of HIV vaccines to mainlyproduce broadly neutralizing antibodies.  The difficulties of HIV vaccine development consist of multipleaspects from both HIV itself and virus-host interaction, which hasalso made it more difficult than the other pathogens. Direct infectionof immune cells and subsequent impairment of HIV specific immune responses,high mutation rates and multiple immune escape strategies, and formationof latent virus reservoir have all contributed to the difficult situationof HIV vaccine development. Moreover, limitations of the current understandingof protective immunity after HIV infection and available technologiesnowadays may also contributed a lot. New methods and technologieswhich have shown promising therapeutic efficacies in dealing withother diseases should be applied to HIV vaccine design, such as gene-editing,immune therapy, and so on. Innovative strategies and creative thinkingshould be stressed to overcome current limitations and may lead tosuccessful development of HIV vaccines in the future.",

        "abstract": "An early and yet indispensable step in the alphaherpesvirus infection is the engagement of host receptors by the viral envelope glycoprotein D (gD). Of the thus-far identified gD receptors, nectin-1 is likely the most effective in terms of its wide usage by multiple alphaherpesviruses for cell entry. The molecular basis of nectin-1 recognition by the gD protein is therefore an interesting scientific question in the alphaherpesvirus field. Previous studies focused on the herpes simplex virus (HSV) of the Simplexvirus genus, for which both the free gD structure and the gD/nectin-1 complex structure were reported at high resolutions. The structural and functional features of other alphaherpesviral gDs, however, remain poorly characterized. In the current study, we systematically studied the characteristics of nectin-1 binding by the gD of a Varicellovirus genus member, the pseudorabies virus (PRV). We first showed that PRV infects host cells via both human and swine nectin-1, and that its gD exhibits similar binding affinities for nectin-1 of the two species. Furthermore, we demonstrated that removal of the PRV gD membrane-proximal residues could significantly increase its affinity for the receptor binding. The structures of PRV gD in the free and the nectin-1-bound states were then solved, revealing a similar overall 3D fold as well as a homologous nectin-1 binding mode to its HSV counterpart. However, several unique features were observed at the binding interface of PRV gD, enabling the viral ligand to utilize different gD residues (from those of HSV) for nectin-1 engagement. These observed binding characteristics were further verified by the mutagenesis study using the key-residue mutants of nectin-1. The structural and functional data obtained in this study, therefore, provide the basis of receptor recognition by PRV gD.",

        "abstract": "Pseudorabies virus (PRV) belongs to the Herpesviridae family, and is an important veterinary pathogen. Highly pathogenic PRV variants have caused severe epidemics in China since 2011, causing huge economic losses. To tackle the epidemics, we identified a panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against PRV glycoprotein B (gB) that effectively block PRV infection. Among these 15 mAbs, fourteen of them block PRV entry in a complement-dependent manner. The remaining one, 1H1 mAb, however can directly neutralize the virus independent of complement and displays broad-spectrum neutralizing activities. We further determined the crystal structure of PRV gB and mapped the epitopes of these antibodies on the structure. Interestingly, all the complement-dependent neutralizing antibodies bind gB at the crown region (domain IV). In contrast, the epitope of 1H1 mAb is located at the bottom of domain I, which includes the fusion loops, indicating 1H1 mAb might neutralize the virus by interfering with the membrane fusion process. Our studies demonstrate that gB contains multiple B-cell epitopes in its crown and base regions and that antibodies targeting different epitopes block virus infection through different mechanisms. These findings would provide important clues for antiviral drug design and vaccine development.",

        "abstract": "Recently, Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged as a global public health concern, and is distinct from other flaviviruses in many aspects, e.g., causing transplacental infection, fetal abnormalities and vector-independent transmission through body fluids in humans. The capsid (C) protein is a multifunctional protein, since it binds to viral RNA in the process of nucleocapsid assembly and plays important roles in virus infection processes by interacting with cellular proteins, modulating cellular metabolism, apoptosis and immune response. Here we solved the crystal structure of ZIKV C protein at a resolution of 1.9\u00c5. The ZIKV C protein structure contains four \u03b1 helices with a long pre-\u03b11 loop, and forms dimers. The unique long pre-\u03b11 loop in ZIKV C contributes to the tighter association of dimeric assembly and renders a divergent hydrophobic feature at the lipid bilayer interface in comparison with the known C structures of West Nile and dengue viruses. We reported the interaction between the ZIKV C protein and lipid droplets through confocal microscopy analysis. Substitutions of key amino acids in the pre-\u03b11 loop of ZIKV C disrupted the interaction with lipid droplets, indicating the loop is critical for membrane association. We also recognized ZIKV C protein possesses broad binding capability to different nucleotide types, including single-stranded and double-stranded RNAs or DNAs. Furthermore, the highly positively charged interface, mainly formed by \u03b14 helix, is proposed to be responsible for nucleotide binding. These findings will greatly enhance our understanding of ZIKV C protein, providing information for anti-ZIKV drug design targeting the C protein.",

        "abstract": "Little is known about the specificities and neutralization breadth of the H7-reactive antibody repertoire induced by natural H7N9 infection in humans. We have isolated and characterized 73 H7-reactive monoclonal antibodies from peripheral B cells from four donors infected in 2013 and 2014. Of these, 45 antibodies were H7-specific, and 17 of these neutralized the virus, albeit with few somatic mutations in their variable domain sequences. An additional set of 28 antibodies, isolated from younger donors born after 1968, cross-reacted between H7 and H3 haemagglutinins in binding assays, and had accumulated significantly more somatic mutations, but were predominantly non-neutralizing in vitro. Crystal structures of three neutralizing and protective antibodies in complex with the H7 haemagglutinin revealed that they recognize overlapping residues surrounding the receptor-binding site of haemagglutinin. One of the antibodies, L4A-14, bound into the sialic acid binding site and made contacts with haemagglutinin residues that were conserved in the great majority of 2016-2017 H7N9 isolates. However, only 3 of the 17 neutralizing antibodies retained activity for the Yangtze River Delta lineage viruses isolated in 2016-2017 that have undergone antigenic change, which emphasizes the need for updated H7N9 vaccines.",

To date, there are no licensed human vaccines or therapeutics available. Here, we report the isolation of monoclonal antibodies from a convalescent patient, targeting the RVFV envelope proteins Gn and Gc. The Gn-specific monoclonal antibodies exhibited much higher neutralizing activities in vitro and protection efficacies in mice against RVFV infection, compared to the Gc-specific monoclonal antibodies. The Gn monoclonal antibodies were found to interfere with soluble Gn binding to cells and prevent infection by blocking the attachment of virions to host cells. Structural analysis of Gn complexed with four Gn-specific monoclonal antibodies resulted in the definition of three antigenic patches (A, B and C) on Gn domain I. Both patches A and B are major neutralizing epitopes. Our results highlight the potential of antibody-based therapeutics and provide a structure-based rationale for designing vaccines against RVFV.",

        "abstract": "The isolation of human monoclonal antibodies with broadly neutralizing breadth can provide a promising countermeasure for influenza A viruses infection. Most broadly neutralizing antibodies against influenza A viruses bind to the conserved stem region or the receptor-binding cavity of hemagglutinin and the interaction is dominated by the heavy chain. The light chain, however, contributes few or no direct contacts to the antigen. Here we report an H3-clade neutralizing human monoclonal antibody, AF4H1K1, which recognizes the hemagglutinin glycoproteins of all group 2 influenza A viruses. This human monoclonal antibody has been obtained through the screening by pairing different heavy and light chains from an H7N9-infected patient based on the next-generation sequencing technology. Further structural studies revealed that light chains modulate the neutralizing spectrum by affecting the local conformation of heavy chains, instead of direct interaction with the antigen. These findings provide important clues to understand the molecular basis of light chains in antigen recognition and to explore the strategies in particular of the use of light chain modification to develop broadly protective monoclonal antibodies against influenza A viruses and other emerging viruses.",

        "abstract": "Arthritogenic alphaviruses, such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), cause severe and debilitating rheumatic diseases worldwide, resulting in severe morbidity and economic costs. Recently, MXRA8 was reported as an entry receptor. Here, we present the crystal structures of the mouse MXRA8, human MXRA8 in complex with the CHIKV E protein, and the cryo-electron microscopy structure of human MXRA8 and CHIKV virus-like particle. MXRA8 has two Ig-like domains with unique structural topologies. This receptor binds in the \"canyon\" between two protomers of the E spike on the surface of the virion. The atomic details at the interface between the two binding entities reveal that both the two domains and the hinge region of MXRA8 are involved in interaction with CHIKV E1-E2 residues from two protomers. Notably, the stalk region of MXRA8 is critical for CHIKV virus entry. This finding provides important information regarding the development of therapeutic countermeasures against those arthritogenic alphaviruses.",

Although cellular receptors for coxsackievirus B in EV-B have been identified, receptors mediating virus entry, especially the uncoating process of echovirus and other EV-B remain obscure. Here, we found that human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is the uncoating receptor for major EV-B. FcRn binds to the virus particles in the \"canyon\" through its FCGRT subunit. By obtaining multiple cryo-electron microscopy structures at different stages of virus entry at atomic or\u00a0near-atomic resolution, we deciphered the underlying mechanisms of enterovirus attachment and uncoating. These structures revealed that different from the attachment receptor CD55, binding of FcRn to the virions induces efficient release of \"pocket factor\" under acidic conditions and initiates the conformational changes in viral particle, providing a structural basis for understanding the mechanisms of enterovirus entry.",

The increase in number of case of microcephaly in newborn children associated with ZIKV infection triggered the World Health Organization to declare the epidemic as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February of 2016. ZIKV is a member of the flavivirus genus and is transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, however in the current epidemic clear evidence is emerging to suggest the virus can be sexually transmitted from human to human. The differences in epidemiology and manifestations of ZIKV infection during these outbreaks have prompted researchers to investigate mechanisms of dissemination, pathogenesis, and host immune response which contributes significantly to the control of the virus infection. The E and NS1 proteins of ZIKV are the major targets for neutralizing and protective antibodies. In this chapter, we mainly focus on recent research on the crystal structures of the ZIKV E and NS1 proteins, and their relations with virus infection and immune responses. These studies will be helpful to develop novel therapeutics and vaccines for protection and control of ZIKV infection.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 has generated enormous interest in the biodiversity, genomics and cross-species transmission potential of coronaviruses, especially those from bats, the second most speciose order of mammals. Herein, we identified a novel coronavirus, provisionally designated Rousettus bat coronavirus GCCDC1 (Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1), in the rectal swab samples of Rousettus leschenaulti bats by using pan-coronavirus RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Although the virus is similar to Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9 (Ro-BatCoV HKU9) in genome characteristics, it is sufficiently distinct to be classified as a new species according to the criteria defined by the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). More striking was that Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 contained a unique gene integrated into the 3'-end of the genome that has no homologs in any known coronavirus, but which sequence and phylogeny analyses indicated most likely originated from the p10 gene of a bat orthoreovirus. Subgenomic mRNA and cellular-level observations demonstrated that the p10 gene is functional and induces the formation of cell syncytia. Therefore, here we report a putative heterologous inter-family recombination event between a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus and a double-stranded segmented RNA virus, providing insights into the fundamental mechanisms of viral evolution.",

Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B4 (LILRB4), which suppresses T cell activation and supports tissue infiltration of AML cells, represents an attractive drug target for anti-AML therapeutics. Here, we report the identification and development of an LILRB4-specific humanized mAb that blocks LILRB4 activation. This mAb, h128-3, showed potent activity in blocking development of monocytic AML in various models including patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mice and syngeneic immunocompetent AML mice. MAb h128-3 enhanced the anti-AML efficacy of chemotherapy treatment by stimulating mobilization of leukemia cells. Mechanistic studies revealed four concordant modes of action for the anti-AML activity of h128-3: 1) reversal of T cell suppression; 2) inhibition of monocytic AML cell tissue infiltration; 3) antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC); and 4) antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). Therefore, targeting LILRB4 with antibody represents an effective therapeutic strategy for treating monocytic AML.",

        "abstract": "Human influenza viruses preferentially bind to sialic acid-\u03b12,6-galactose (SA\u03b12,6Gal) receptors, which are predominant in human upper respiratory epithelia, whereas avian influenza viruses preferentially bind to SA\u03b12,3Gal receptors. However, variants with amino acid substitutions around the receptor-binding sites of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein can be selected after several passages of human influenza viruses from patients' respiratory samples in the allantoic cavities of embryonated chicken eggs. In this study, we detected an egg-adapted HA S190R mutation in the pandemic H1N1 virus 2009 (pdmH1N1), and evaluated the effects of this mutation on receptor binding affinity and pathogenicity in mice. Our results revealed that residue 190 is located within the pocket structure of the receptor binding site. The single mutation to arginine at position 190 slightly increased the binding affinity of the virus to the avian receptor and decreased its binding to the long human \u03b12,6-linked sialic acid receptor. Our study demonstrated that the S190R mutation resulted in earlier death and higher weight loss in mice compared with the wild-type virus. Higher viral titers at 1 dpi (days post infection) and diffuse damage at 4 dpi were observed in the lung tissues of mice infected with the mutant virus.",

        "abstract": "Ebolavirus vaccines based on several adenoviral vectors have been investigated in preclinical studies and clinical trials. The use of adenovirus serotype 2 as a vector for ebolavirus vaccine has not been reported. Herein, we generated rAd2-ZGP, a recombinant replication-incompetent adenovirus serotype 2 expressing codon-optimized Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein, and evaluated its immunogenicity in mice and rhesus macaques. rAd2-ZGP induced significant antibody and cell-mediated immune responses at 2 weeks after a single immunization. The glycoprotein (GP)-specific immune responses could be further enhanced with a booster immunization. Compared to protein antigens, Zaire ebolavirus GP and Zaire ebolavirus-like particles, rAd2-ZGP could induce stronger cross-reactive antibody and cell-mediated immune responses to heterologous Sudan ebolavirus in mice and rhesus macaques. In rAd2-ZGP-immunized macaques, GP-specific CD8 T cells could secret IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2, indicating a Th1-biased response. In adenovirus serotype 5 seropositive macaques, rAd2-ZGP could induce robust antibody and cell-mediated immune responses, suggesting that the efficacy of rAd2-ZGP is not affected by pre-existing immunity to adenovirus serotype 5. These results demonstrated that rAd2-ZGP can be considered an alternative ebolavirus vaccine for use in adenovirus serotype 5 seropositive subjects or as a sequential booster vaccine after the subjects have been immunized with a recombinant adenovirus serotype 5-based vaccine.",

        "abstract": "The soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex is composed of three neuronal proteins VAMP2, Syntaxin and SNAP25, which plays a core role during the process of membrane fusion. The zipping assembly of the SNARE complex releases energies and drives the vesicle and cell membrane into close proximity. In this study, we use all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to probe the dynamics of SNARE and its unzipping process in the context of membrane at the atomistic details. Our results indicated that the NTD of SNARE core domain is relatively more stable than CTD, which is in agreement with previous experiments. More importantly, possible interactions between the linker loop (LL) region of SNAP25 and VAMP2 are observed, suggests that the LL region may facilitate VAMP2 binding and SNARE initiation. The forced unzipping of SNARE in the presence of membrane and LL of SNAP25 reveals the possible pathway for energy generation of SNARE zipping, provides information to understand how force may regulate the cooperativity between the membrane and the SNARE complex.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Third Tofo Advanced Study Week on Emerging and Re-Emerging Viruses (3rd TASW) was held in Praia do Tofo, Mozambique, from September 02 to 06, 2018. It brought together 55 participants from 10 African countries as well as from Belgium, China, Germany, Singapore, and the USA. Meeting sessions covered aspects of the epidemiology, diagnosis, molecular and structural biology, vaccine development, and antiviral drug discovery for emerging RNA viruses that are current threats in Africa and included flaviviruses (dengue and Zika), alphaviruses (chikungunya), coronaviruses, filoviruses (Ebola), influenza viruses, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Rift Valley fever Virus, Lassa virus, and others. Data were presented on recent flavivirus and/or chikungunyavirus outbreaks in Angola, Burkina Faso, and Mozambique. In addition, these viruses are endemic in many sub-Saharan countries. The TASW series on emerging viruses is unique in Africa and successful in promoting collaborations between researchers in Africa and other parts of the world, as well as among African scientists. This report summarizes the lectures held at the meeting and highlights advances in the field.",

        "abstract": "Antibody production is resulted from B cell activation and proliferation upon antigen binding. Discs large homolog 1 (Dlg1), a scaffold protein from membrane-associated guanylate-kinase family, has been shown to regulate the antigen receptor signaling and cell polarity in lymphocytes, however the physiological function of Dlg1 in humoral response is not completely clear. Here we addressed this question using conditional knockout (KO) mouse model with Dlg1 deficiency in different B cell subsets by crossing dlg1fl/fl mice with either mb1cre/+ or aicdacre/+ mice respectively. In both mouse models, we observed that Dlg1 deficiency in B cells (Dlg1-KO B cells) led to obvious hyper-antibody responses upon immunization, the effect of which was more obvious in antigen-recall responses. Mechanistically, we found that Dlg1-KO B cells exhibited hyper-proliferation than wild-type B cells upon antigen stimulation, suggesting that the hyper-antibody responses are likely induced by the hyper-proliferation of Dlg1-KO B cells. Indeed, further studies demonstrated that Dlg1 deficiency in B cells led to the down-regulation of a tumor suppressor, FoxO1. Thus, all these results reveal an unexpected function of Dlg1 in refraining hyper-antibody responses through the inhibition of FoxO1 and thus antigen-binding induced proliferation in B cells.",

        "abstract": "Ebola virus (EBOV) causes fatal hemorrhagic fever with high death rates in human. Currently, there are no available clinically-approved prophylactic or therapeutic treatments. The recently solved crystal structure of cleavage-primed EBOV glycoprotein (GPcl) in complex with the C domain of endosomal protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) provides a new target for the development of EBOV entry inhibitors. In this work, a computational approach using docking and molecular dynamic simulations is carried out for the rational design of peptide inhibitors. A novel cyclo-peptide (Pep-3.3) was identified to target at the late stage of EBOV entry and exhibit specific inhibitory activity against EBOV-GP pseudotyped viruses, with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 5.1\u202f\u03bcM. In vitro binding assay and molecular simulations revealed that Pep-3.3 binds to GPcl with a KD value of 69.7\u202f\u03bcM, through interacting with predicted residues in the hydrophobic binding pocket of GPcl. Mutation of predicted residues T83 caused resistance to Pep-3.3 inhibition in viral infectivity, providing preliminary support for the model of the peptide binding to GPcl. This study demonstrates the feasibility of inhibiting EBOV entry by targeting GPcl with peptides.",

The glycosylation of neuraminidase (NA) could affect the infectivity and virulence of influenza virus, but detailed site-specific glycosylation information of NA is still missing. In this study, intact glycopeptide analysis was performed on an influenza NA (A/H1N1/California/2009) that was expressed in human 293T and insect Hi-5 cells. Our data indicated that three of four potential N-linked glycosylation sites were glycosylated, including one partial glycosylation site from both cell lines. The NA expressed in human cells had more complex glycans than that of insect cells, suggesting the importance of selecting an appropriate expression system for the production of functional glycoproteins. Different types of glycans were identified from different glycosites of NA expressed in human cells, which implied the site-dependence of glycosylation on NA. This study provides valuable information for the research of influenza virus as well as the functions of viral protein glycosylation. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "Conserved V\u03b41 binding geometry in a setting of locus-disparate pHLA recognition by \u03b4/\u03b1\u03b2TCRs: insight into recognition of HIV peptides by TCR.",
        "abstract": "Given a limited set of TCR V genes which are used to create TCRs that are reactive to different ligands, such as MHC class I, MHC class II and MHC-like proteins (for example, MIC molecules and CD1 molecules), the V\u03b41 segment can be rearranged with D\u03b4-J\u03b4-C\u03b4 or J\u03b1-C\u03b1 segments, to form classical \u03b3\u03b4TCR or uncommon \u03b1\u03b2TCR using a V\u03b41 segment (\u03b4/\u03b1\u03b2TCR). Here we have determined two complex structures of the \u03b4/\u03b1\u03b2TCRs (S19-2 and TU55) bound to different locus-disparate MHCIs with HIV peptides (HLA-A*2402-Nef138-10 and HLA-B*3501-Pol448-9). The overall binding modes resemble classical \u03b1\u03b2TCRs, but display a strong tilt binding geometry of V\u03b41 domain towards the HLA \u03b11 helix, due to a conserved extensive interaction between the CDR1\u03b4 loop and N-terminal region of \u03b11 helix (mainly in position 62). The aromatic amino acids of the CDR1\u03b4 loop exploit different conformations (\"aromatic-ladder\" or \"aromatic-hairpin\") to accommodate distinct MHC helical scaffolds. This tolerance helps to explain how a particular TCR V region can similarly dock onto multiple MHC molecules, and thus, may potentially explain the nature of TCR cross-reactivity. In addition, the length of CDR3\u03b4 loop could affect the extent of tilt binding of V\u03b41 domain, and adaptively, the pairing V\u03b2 domains adjust their mass centers to generate differential MHC contacts, hence probably ensuring the TCR specificity to a certain peptide-MHC. Our data have provided further structural insights into the TCR recognition of classical pMHCI molecules, unifying the cross-reactivity and specificity together. The specificity of \u03b1\u03b2 T cell recognition is determined by the CDR loops of the \u03b1\u03b2TCR and the general binding mode of \u03b1\u03b2TCRs to pMHC has been established over the last decade. Due to the intrinsic genomic structure of the TCR \u03b1/\u03b4 chain locus, some V\u03b4 segments can rearrange with C\u03b1 segment, forming a hybrid V\u03b4C\u03b1V\u03b2C\u03b2 TCR, \u03b4/\u03b1\u03b2TCR. However, the basis for the molecular recognition of such TCRs to their ligands is elusive. Here, an \u03b1\u03b2TCR using V\u03b41 segment, S19-2, is isolated from a HIV-infected patient, in an HLA-A*24:02 restricted manner. Then we solved the crystal structures of S19-2 TCR and another \u03b4/\u03b1\u03b2TCR TU55 binding to their ligands respectively, revealing a conserved V\u03b41 binding feature. Further binding kinetics analysis reveals that the S19-2 and TU55 TCRs bind pHLA very tightly and long-lastingly. Our results illustrate the binding mode of a TCR using V\u03b41 segment to its ligand, virus-derived pHLA.",

The use of chain-growth copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition polymerization (CuAACP) enabled accurate control of the ratio and distance of three incorporated fluorophores: coumarin (Cou), nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD), and photo-switchable spiropyran (SP) that could be reversibly transformed to its red-emitting merocyanine (MC) state. Within the FRET system, the energy flow from Cou to MC was significantly enhanced by the introduction of NBD as a middle relaying fluorophore. Moreover, the energy transfer efficiency was increased via changing the solvent from THF to more polar water, accompanied with obvious color change in fluorescence behavior. These correlations of polymer composition and solvent polarity to the FRET efficiency were finally applied to the effective detection of CN- anion, demonstrating a function of this polymer as the CN- sensor.",

        "abstract": "A method was developed to synthesize molecular brushes with polymethacrylate backbone and ultrahigh density of grafted side chains (SCs), i.e., 1.34 SCs per backbone carbon atom, using accelerated copper-catalyzed azide\u2013alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) grafting-onto strategy. This acceleration effect that benefits from the complexation of triazole with Cu was first confirmed in two model CuAAC reactions of (a) 1:1 molar ratio of a diazide compound and an alkynyl-terminated poly(ethylene oxide) (ay-PEO18 with average degree of polymerization DP = 18) and (b) 1:1 molar ratio of a dialkyne compound and an azido-terminated N3-PEO18. It was found that both model reactions produced ditriazoles as major products, although the former reaction exhibited a higher yield of PEO\u2013PEO dimers, demonstrating better CuAAC acceleration effect. Following this principle, polymethacrylate backbones with multiazido dangling groups were subsequently used for grafting-onto reaction with ay-SCs to prepare an array of molecular brushes...",

The hyperbranched polymer that was synthesized from the chain-growth copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition polymerization of a tetrafunctional AB 3  monomer showed low-dispersity structure, tunable sizes, and consequently produced hyperstar polymers with high density of PEO dangling arms at periphery. Loading HAuCl 4  precursor at varied molar ratios to the triazole units in the core directly changed the size of Au nanoparticles after reduction by NaBH 4 , exhibiting different intensities in X-ray diffraction spectroscopy. The obtained Au nanoparticles were further investigated as co-catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction when hybridized with molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) nanosheets, showing enhanced electrocatalytic activity.",

In various feed ratios of the AB3 monomer to a B3 core, the polymerizations demonstrated a chain-growth mechanism with a linear increase of molecular weight versus conversion, low polydispersity and a high degree of branching (DB). The large amount of terminal azido groups on the HBPs periphery were further modified via reaction with an alkynyl-terminated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to produce water-soluble PEGylated HBPs. Under acidic conditions, both the HBPs and the PEGylated HBPs exhibited clean and fast degradation into low-molecular weight compounds, confirming the labile acetal linkers in the backbone of HBPs.",

Traditional reversible addition\u2013fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) homopolymerization of transmers that used thermal initiator as radical source has been reported to only produce hyperbranched polymers with relatively low molecular weights (\u2264104). The first part of this study extensively varied the experimental parameters in RAFT polymerization but could only marginally improve the polymer molecular weights. It was found that the vinyl focal groups were gradually consumed during the polymerization and the radical termination reactions were mainly happening between propagating radicals and primary radicals from the thermal initiator, which failed to increase the polymer molecular weight. In the second part, a new strategy was explored that used copper catalyst to activate the alkyl trithiocarbona...",

In contrast to the traditional triazido core molecule that failed to produce high molecular weight polymer, a novel tris-triazoleamine-based B3 molecule was designed, which complexed with CuI catalyst and activated the azido reactivity in both B3 and B3-containing polymers. The polymerization demonstrated linear increase of polymer molecular weights with the feed ratio of [AB2]0:[B3]0 with no need of slow monomer addition. At the same time, a higher ratio of [CuI]0:[B3]0 showed no influence on molecular weight but significantly increased the polymerization rate and produced hyperbranched polymers with higher degree of branching. The one-pot polymerization using [AB2]0:[B3]0:[Cu]0 = 2700:1:10 produced hyperbranched polymers with molecular weight Mn = 1.01 \u00d7 106 and polydispersity Mw/Mn...",

As polymersomes are soft and highly deformable, their shape instability due to osmolarity difference across polymer membranes and low elasticity could conversely limit their practical use. Instead of selecting particular polymer chemical reactions to enhance the mechanical properties, we have employed inorganic polyoxometalate (POM) clusters as simple physical cross-linkers to control the shape and mechanical stability of polymersomes in aqueous suspensions. Robust spherical shape with enhanced elastic and bending moduli of POM-dressed poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) based polymersomes is achieved. We have accounted for the hydrogen bonding between POM and PEO blocks for the adsorption and stabilization of POMS on polymersomes, whose interaction strength could also be tuned by mixing solvents of hydrogen bond donors or receptors with water.

At 55 \u00b0C, the LH2 complex from Tch. tepidum maintained efficient near-infrared light harvesting and B800-to-B850 EET dynamics, whereas this EET process was disrupted in the case of Rba. sphaeroides 2.4.1 owing to the structural distortion of the LH2 comple...",

The synthesis started with atom transfer radical copolymerization of an inimer with a cyclic disulfide-containing methacrylate monomer in a microemulsion to produce hyperbranched copolymers with high molar mass, low polydispersity, and a vital fraction of dangling disulfide groups. The core-shell structured hyperstar polymers were then prepared using hyperbranched copolymers as macroinitiators to polymerize oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (M = 500) and grow the radiating arms. The hyperstar polymers with disulfide groups were proved to efficiently encapsulate Au(SR) nanoclusters through ligand exchange without destroying the fine structure of the Au(SR) clusters. The obtained hyperstar-Au(SR) nanocomposites showed great stability with no size change after a three-month shelf storage. They were used as efficient catalysts for the catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol by NaBH, showing convenient recovery and reuse without losing catalytic efficiency.",

In this study, membranes that take inspiration from the mosaic structure of cell walls and use multiple functionalities of unique chemical design to control solute transport through chemical factors as well as steric factors are detailed. Specifically, a poly{acrylonitrile-co-[oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate]-co-(3-azido-2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate)} copolymer tailor-made for the generation of nanofilters, which possess a high density of well-defined pores that are lined by azido moieties, allowed for the generation of chemically patterned mosaic membranes in a rapid manner through the use of printing devices. By engineering the composition of the reactive ink solutions printed on the membrane to allow for the rapid, one-to-one covalent attachment of alkynyl-functionalized groups to the azido moieties, we generated large areas of patterned membranes in seconds rather than ho...",

We here use an innovative approach that may ultimately allow for the clinician to target tumors and aggressively reduce tumor burden in patients with NSCLC. In this study, a platinum (Pt)-based chemotherapeutic (cisplatin, carboplatin, or oxaliplatin) and holmium-165 (Ho), which can be neutron-activated to produce the holmium-166 radionuclide, have been incorporated together in a garnet magnetic nanoparticle (HoIG-Pt) for selective delivery to tumors using an external magnet. The synthesized magnetic HoIG nanoparticles were characterized using PXRD, TEM, ICP-MS, and neutron-activation. Platinum(II) drugs were incorporated onto HoIG, and these were characterized using FTIR, EDX, ICP-MS, and zeta potential measurements, and in vitro and in vivo studies were performed using a HoIG-platinum system. Results indicate that neutron-activated 166HoIG-cisplatin is more toxic toward NSCLC A549 cells than is blank 166HoIG and free cisplatin, and that when an external magnetic field is applied in vivo, higher tumor to liver ratios of Ho are observed than when no magnet is applied, suggesting that magnetic targeting is achieved using this system. Furthermore, an efficacy study demonstrated the inhibition of tumor growth by chemoradiotherapeutic magnetic nanoparticles, compared to no treatment controls.",

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the Unites States, and approximately 85% of all lung cancers are classified as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is extremely difficult to treat and its survival rate is low. After decades of clinical trials, the most effective treatments are still those that implement the first-generation platinum anticancer agent cisplatin (CDDP) in combination with other drugs. We previously demonstrated that the naturally-occurring compound phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) can be used to sensitize NSCLC cells to CDDP. Furthermore, co-encapsulation of PEITC and CDDP in liposomes enhances their toxicity toward NSCLC cells. We here optimize liposomal-PEITC-CDDP, demonstrate the release of PEITC and CDDP from the nanoparticle, and show that liposomal-PEITC-CDDP is much more toxic toward both A549 and H596 human NSCLC cell lines than toward WI-38 and BEAS-2B human normal lung cell lines. Thus, we have prepared an efficacious therapy that has significantly higher toxicity toward cancer cell lines than normal cell lines.",

        "abstract": "Over the last few decades, holmium (Ho) has been investigated for its application in laser surgery, magnetic resonance imaging, and internal and topical radionuclide therapy. Ho has a 100% natural abundance of holmium-165, which is a stable nuclide that can undergo a process called neutron-activation to generate radioactive holmium-166 (166Ho). 166Ho emits \u03b2\u2013particles and \u03b3 photons, with a half-life of 26.8 h; \u03b2\u2013particles can damage a cancer cell\u2019s DNA, while \u03b3 photons allow for 166Ho to be imaged in vivo and easily quantitated prior to, or during, dosing. This article gives a thorough account of the work being done around the world on 166Ho for use as an internal or topical radionuclide therapy against cancer. Our research group and others have generated compelling data that support the use of 166Ho as a radiotherapeutic in the clinic, especially since pharmaceutical formulations can be made while non-radioactive (Ho) and then made radioactive (166Ho) just prior to use.",

However, the catalytic performances of enzyme mimics are often decreased due to different spatial structures or absence of functional groups compared to natural enzymes. Here, we report a highly efficient enzyme-like catalytic performance of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) by visible-light stimulation. The enzyme-like reaction is evaluated by the catalytic reaction of AuNPs oxidizing a typical chromogenic substrate 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzydine (TMB) with hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. From investigations of the wavelength-dependent reaction rate, radical capture, hole-donor addition, and dark-field scattering spectroscopy experiments, it is revealed that the strong plasmonic absorption of AuNPs facilitates generation of hot electrons, which are transfered from AuNPs to the adsorbed reactant molecule, greatly promoting the catalytic performance of the enzyme-like catalytic reaction. The present work provides a simple method for improving the performance of enzyme mimics, which is expected to find further application in the field of plasmon-enhanced biocatalysis and biosensors.",

        "abstract": "We demonstrate a core-satellite plasmonic nanoprobe assembled via metal ion-dependent DNA-cleaving DNAzyme linker for imaging intercellular metal ion based on plasmon coupling effect at a single particle level. As metal ions are present in the system, the DNAzyme linker will be cleaved, and thus, disassembly of the core-satellite nanoprobes occurs, which results in distinct blue shift of the scattering spectra of Au core-satellite probes and naked color change of the scattering light. This change in scattering spectra has been supported by theoretical simulations. As a proof of concept, sensitive detection of Cu2+ with a detection limit down to 100 pM have been demonstrated. The nanoprobes have been further utilized for intracellular Cu2+ imaging in living cells. The results demonstrate that the present strategy provides a promising platform for detection and imaging of metal ions in living cells and could be potentially applied to imaging other interesting target molecules simply by substituting the oligonucleotide sequence.",

Thus far, most reported work has been limited to plasmon-induced chemical transformations. Herein, we demonstrate that electrochemical reactions can also be accelerated by plasmonic nanoparticles upon LSPR excitation. Using glucose electrocatalysis as a model reaction system, the direct plasmon-accelerated electrochemical reaction (PAER) on gold nanoparticles is observed. The wavelength- and solution-pH-dependent electrochemical oxidation rate and the dark-field scattering spectroscopy results confirm that the hot charge carriers generated during plasmon decay are responsible for the enhanced electrocatalysis performance. Based on the proposed PAER mechanism, a plasmon-improved glucose electrochemical sensor is constructed, demonstrating the enhanced performance of the non-enzyme sensor upon...",

However, its real application is yet hindered owing to the lack of efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, we propose a plasmon activation approach for the acceleration of the OER on a Au nanorod\u20132D ultrathin metal\u2013organic framework (NiCo-MOF) hybrid. The plasmon-generated hot holes of Au nanorods (AuNRs) can be injected into the nickel active sites of the OER catalyst, significantly increasing the generation of high valence Ni* active species in NiCo-MOFs with better matched energy levels for the OER, in turn decreasing the OER activation energy. Thus, excellent OER performance of the NiCo-MOFs under surface plasmon resonance of AuNRs is achieved with an overpotential of 240 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 and a Tafel slope of 69 mV dec\u22121, which is much better than that of the reported catalysts. This finding highlights the importance of noble metal LSPR in facilitating the OER performance of MOFs and opens up a new avenue for improving the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of pristine MOFs.",

        "abstract": "The photoelectrochemical performance of a zinc porphyrin sensitized TiO2 photoelectrode fabricated through the axial-coordination strategy has been studied. Zinc(II) tetraphenylporphyrin (TPPZn) was immobilized on the TiO2 electrode through the axial coordination reaction with surface pre-modified Methyl 4-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)benzoate (PhImMe). Spectral characterizations were carried out to confirm the robust interaction between TPPZn and PhImMe, while the chemical bonding of PhImMe on TiO2 surface has been evidenced by XPS measurement. The modified TiO2 electrode produces a stable and enhanced photocurrent signal under 410 nm irradiation at a bias of 0.2 V in phosphate buffer solution, compared with pristine TiO2. Sensitive increment of photocurrent is observed with the addition of L-glutathione. Possible mechanism for this photoelectrochemical process includes the photoexcitation of the porphyrin, electron injection from porphyrin toward the TiO2 and the hole-scavenging process by the reductants. The \"lying-low\" surface conformation of the porphyrin plane might facilitate the PEC process owing to the enhanced electronic coupling between the porphyrin plane and the TiO2 substrate. A PEC analysis on L-glutathione has been carried out to evaluate the photoelectrochemical performance of the modified TiO2 electrode, which presents the wide linear ranges of 5-80 \u03bcM and 80-5000 \u03bcM, with a lower detection limit of 3.21 \u03bcM at an S/N ratio of 3. This work reports for the first time on the PEC performance of metalloporphyrin axially coordinated on semiconductor surface and could lead to the designing of more efficient photoelectrochemical sensors and devices based on similar electrode structures.",

Pt catalyzes HER efficiently, however, its scarcity and high cost inspire researchers to explore metallic catalysts with core-shell nanostructures. Precise tailoring of Pt catalysts at atomic monolayer level would shed insights on the relationship between electronic structure and electrocatalytic properties. Herein, we report the preparation of Au-Pt core-shell nanoparticles deposited on graphene sheets with tunable Pt monolayer coverage by controlling Cu underpotential deposition (UPD)-Galvanic replacement cycles. The electrochemical results suggest that Au-Pt with monolayer Pt shows superior electrocatalytic activity toward HER. Increasing the thickness of Pt shell results in the decrease of the electrocatalytic activity, which might be attributed to the decreased electronic interactions of Au core with outmost surface Pt atoms as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic characterization. The present research would offer a design criterion for metallic nanostructures in realizing catalysts with high performance.",

Additionally, this system also affords real-time analysis of binding kinetics between antigen and antibody, allowing for obtaining their rate constants of association/disassociation ( k   on  / k   off  ) and equilibrium constant  K   d   of 3.95\u202f\u03bcM.

        "abstract": "The conversion of water to hydrogen (hydrogen evolution reaction, HER) in regenerative fuel cells promises an environmentally friendly framework for smoothing out the energy crisis. However, addressing this issue depends on the development of efficient electrocatalyst design to replace precious platinum catalysts. Herein, we construct cobalt-phosphonate coordination polymer nanosheets bioinspired by active center engineering and coordination environments of catalytic sites in natural enzymes, which catalyze HER at an overpotential of 84 mV under neutral conditions. We propose that the introduction of a phosphate group tunes the electron density of the cobalt ion center and synergistically accelerates HER in a bifunctional activation mechanism of water molecules. This research sheds light on the relationship between the electrocatalyst structures and their catalytic activities, a concept that has broad implications for the design of efficient electrocatalysts in energy conversion.",

        "abstract": "Nuclear pore complexes play central roles as gatekeepers of RNA and protein transport between the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. However, their large size and dynamic nature have impeded a full structural and functional elucidation. Here we determined the structure of the entire 552-protein nuclear pore complex of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae at sub-nanometre precision by satisfying a wide range of data relating to the molecular arrangement of its constituents. The nuclear pore complex incorporates sturdy diagonal columns and connector cables attached to these columns, imbuing the structure with strength and flexibility. These cables also tie together all other elements of the nuclear pore complex, including membrane-interacting regions, outer rings and RNA-processing platforms. Inwardly directed anchors create a high density of transport factor-docking Phe-Gly repeats in the central channel, organized into distinct functional units. This integrative structure enables us to rationalize the architecture, transport mechanism and evolutionary origins of the nuclear pore complex.",

Although Gdown1 is intrinsically disordered, its Pol II interacting domains were localized and shown to occlude transcription factor IIF (TFIIF) and transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) binding by perfect positioning on their Pol II interaction sites. Robust binding of Gdown1 to Pol II is established by cooperative interactions of a strong Pol II binding region and two weaker binding modulatory regions, thus providing a mechanism both for tight Pol II binding and transcription inhibition and for its reversal. In support of a physiological function for Gdown1 in transcription repression, Gdown1 co-localizes with Pol II in transcriptionally silent nuclei of early Drosophila embryos but re-localizes to the cytoplasm during zygotic genome activation. Our study reveals a self-inactivation through Gdown1 binding as a unique mode of repression in Pol II function.",

        "abstract": "mRNA biogenesis is an essential and intricate process that occurs within the nucleus and ends with the mRNA export through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), a conserved process which defects lead to serious human diseases. The protein assemblies that perform the last steps in mRNA export are located at the cytoplasmic face of the Nuclear Pore complex (NPC). Here we describe the molecular architecture of the NPC cytoplasmic mRNA export machinery. Through an integrative modeling approach that combines various sources of data, including chemical cross-linking, electron microscopy, and small angle X-ray scattering, we generate a hybrid structure of the native Nup82 complex, the main component of the assembly. Correlative phenotypic mapping and structural data from chemical cross-linking reveal how the Nup82 complex docks into the Nup84 complex at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC and allows us to generate a first map of the associated mRNA remodeling machinery. Our map serves as a framework to understand the mRNA export process and NPC function.",

By integrating diverse structural data, we have determined the molecular architecture of the native Nup82 complex at subnanometer precision. The complex consists of two compositionally\u00a0identical multiprotein subunits that adopt different configurations. The Nup82 complex fits into the NPC through the outer ring Nup84 complex. Our map shows that this entire 14-MDa Nup82-Nup84 complex assembly positions the cytoplasmic mRNA export factor docking sites and messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) remodeling machinery right over the NPCu0027s central channel rather than on\u00a0distal cytoplasmic filaments, as previously supposed. We suggest that this configuration efficiently captures and remodels exporting mRNP particles immediately upon reaching the cytoplasmic side of\u00a0the NPC.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are a family of lipid kinases that are activated by growth factor and G-protein-coupled receptors and propagate intracellular signals for growth, survival, proliferation, and metabolism. p85\u03b1, a modular protein consisting of five domains, binds and inhibits the enzymatic activity of class IA PI3K catalytic subunits. Here, we describe the structural states of the p85\u03b1 dimer, based on data from in vivo and in vitro solution characterization. Our in vitro assembly and structural analyses have been enabled by the creation of cysteine-free p85\u03b1 that is functionally equivalent to native p85\u03b1. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies showed that p85\u03b1 undergoes rapidly reversible monomer-dimer assembly that is highly exothermic in nature. In addition to the documented SH3-PR1 dimerization interaction, we identified a second intermolecular interaction mediated by cSH2 domains at the C-terminal end of the polypeptide. We have demonstrated in vivo concentration-dependent dimerization of p85\u03b1 using fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy. Finally, we have defined solution conditions under which the protein is predominantly monomeric or dimeric, providing the basis for small angle x-ray scattering and chemical cross-linking structural analysis of the discrete dimer. These experimental data have been used for the integrative structure determination of the p85\u03b1 dimer. Our study provides new insight into the structure and assembly of the p85\u03b1 homodimer and suggests that this protein is a highly dynamic molecule whose conformational flexibility allows it to transiently associate with multiple binding proteins.",

Dysregulation of autophagy is linked to a growing number of human diseases. The Beclin 1-Vps34 protein-protein interaction network is critical for autophagy regulation and is therefore essential to cellular integrity. Manipulation of autophagy, in particular via modulation of the action of the Beclin 1-Vps34 complexes, is considered a promising route to combat autophagy-related diseases. Here we summarize recent findings on the core components and structural architecture of the Beclin 1-Vps34 complexes, and how these findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the multiple functions of these complexes and for devising therapeutic strategies.",

Here we report the reconstitution of a functional 15-subunit human core Mediator complex and its characterization by functional assays and chemical cross-linking coupled to MS (CX-MS). Whereas the reconstituted head and middle modules can stably associate, basal and coactivator functions are acquired only after incorporation of MED14 into the bimodular complex. This results from a dramatically enhanced ability of MED14-containing complexes to associate with Pol II. Altogether, our analyses identify MED14 as both an architectural and a functional backbone of the Mediator complex. We further establish a conditional requirement for metazoan-specific MED26 that becomes evident in the presence of heterologous nuclear factors. This general approach paves the way for systematic dissection of the multiple layers of functionality associated with the Mediator complex.",

        "abstract": "Nucleotide supply is essential for DNA replication in proliferating cells including cancer cells. Ribose-phosphate diphosphokinase 1 (PRPS1) is a key enzyme to produce the consensus precursor of nucleotide synthesis. PRPS1 participates in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) by catalyzing the phospho-ribosylation of D-ribose 5-phosphate (R-5P) to 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP). Therefore, PRPS1 not only controls purine biosynthesis and supplies precursors for DNA and RNA biosynthesis but also regulates PPP through a feedback loop of the PRPS1 substrate R-5P. However, it is still elusive whether PRPS1 enhances nucleotide synthesis during cell cycle progression. In this study, we explore the role and activation mechanism of PRPS1 in cell cycle progression of CRC, and observed a peak in its enzymatic activity during S phase. CDK1 contributes to upregulation of PRPS1 activity by phosphorylating PRPS1 at S103; loss of phosphorylation at S103 delayed the cell cycle and decreased cell proliferation. PRPS1 activity in colorectal cancer samples is higher than in adjacent tissue, and the use of an antibody that specifically detects PRPS1 phosphorylation at S103 showed consistent results in 184 CRC tissues. In conclusion, compared with upregulation of PRPS1 expression levels, increased PRPS1 activity, which is marked by S103 phosphorylation, is more important in promoting tumorigenesis and is a promising diagnostic indicator for CRC.",

        "abstract": "Aristolochic acid (AA) derived from traditional Chinese herbal remedies has recently been statistically associated with human liver cancer; however, the causal relationships between AA and liver cancer and the underlying evolutionary process of AA-mediated mutagenesis during tumorigenesis are obscure. Here, we subjected mice, including  Pten -deficient ones, to aristolochic acid I (AAI) alone or a combination of AAI and carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 ), which may induce liver injury. Significantly, AAI promoted the development of liver cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, in a dose-dependent manner, and it increased the incidence of liver cancer, together with CCl 4  or  Pten  deficiency. AAI could lead to DNA damage and AAI-DNA adducts that initiate liver cancer via characteristic Au003eT transversions, as indicated by the comprehensive genomic analysis, which revealed recurrent mutations in  Hras  and some genes encoding components of the Ras/Raf, PI3K, Notch, Hippo, Wnt, DNA polymerase family and the SWI/SNF complex, some of which are also often found in human liver cancer. Mutational signature analysis across human cancer types revealed that the AA-related dominant signature was especially implicated in liver cancer in China, based on very stringent criteria derived from the animal cancer form, in which mutations of  TP53  and  JAK1  are prone to be significantly enriched. Interestingly, AAI-mediated characteristic Au003eT mutations were the earliest genetic event driving malignant subclonal evolution in mouse and human liver cancer. In general, this study provides documented evidence for AA-induced liver cancer with featured mutational processes during malignant clonal evolution, laying a solid foundation for the prevention and diagnosis of AA-associated human cancers, especially liver cancer.",

        "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis (NASH) have become a worldwide health concern because of lifestyle changes, but it is still lack of specific therapeutic strategies as the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our previous study indicated that deficiency of Arid1a, a key component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, initiated mouse steatohepatitis, implying that Arid1a might be essentially required for the integrity of hepatic lipid metabolism. However, the exact mechanisms of the pathological process due to Arid1a loss are unclear. In the present work, we show that hepatocyte-specific deletion of Arid1a significantly increases susceptibility to develop hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD), along with the aggravated inflammatory responses marked by increment of serum alanine amino transferase (AST), aspartate amino transferase (AST) and TNFalpha; Mechanistically, Arid1a deficiency leads to the reduction of chromatin modification characteristic of transcriptional activation on multiple metabolic genes, especially Cpt1a and Acox1, two rate-limiting enzyme genes for fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, our data indicated that Arid1a loss promotes hepatic steatosis by downregulating PPARalpha, thereby impairing fatty acid oxidation which leads to lipid accumulation and insulin resistance. These findings reveal that targeting ARID1a might be a promising therapeutic strategy for NAFLD, NASH and insulin resistance.",

        "abstract": "Cancer-associated cachexia reduces survival, which has been attenuated by blocking the activin receptor type 2B (ACVR2B) ligands in mice. The purpose of this study was to unravel the underlying physiology and novel cachexia biomarkers using the colon-26 (C26) carcinoma model of cancer cachexia. BALB/c male mice were subcutaneously inoculated with C26 cancer cells or vehicle control. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with vehicle (C26+PBS) or soluble ACVR2B either before (C26+sACVR/b) or before and after (C26+sACVR/c) tumor formation. Skeletal muscle and serum metabolomics analysis was conducted by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Cancer altered various biologically functional groups representing: 1) amino acids, 2) energy sources and 3) nucleotide related intermediates. Muscle metabolomics revealed increased content of free phenylalanine in cancer that strongly correlated with the loss of body mass within the last two days of the experiment. This correlation was also detected in serum. Decreased ribosomal RNA content and phosphorylation of a marker of pyrimidine synthesis revealed changes in nucleotide metabolism in cancer. Overall, the effect of the experimental C26 cancer predominated over blocking ACVR2B ligands in both muscle and serum. However, the level of methyl phosphate, which was decreased in the muscle in cancer, was restored by sACVR2B-Fc treatment. In conclusion, experimental cancer affected muscle and blood metabolomes mostly independent of blocking ACVR2B ligands. Of the affected metabolites, we have identified free phenylalanine as a promising biomarker of muscle atrophy or cachexia. Finally, the decreased capacity for pyrimidine nucleotide and protein synthesis in tumor-bearing mice opens up new avenues in cachexia research.",

        "abstract": "The high-throughput sequencing technology has yielded reliable and ultra-fast sequencing for DNA and RNA. For tumor cells of cancer patients, when combining the results of DNA and RNA sequencing, one can identify potential neoantigens that stimulate immune response of the T cells. However, when the somatic mutations are abundant, it is computationally challenging to efficiently prioritize the identified neoantigen candidates according to their ability of activating the T cell immuno-response. Numerous prioritization or prediction approaches have been proposed to address this issue but none of them considers the original DNA loci of the neoantigens from the perspective of 3D genome. Here we retrospect the DNA origins of the immune-positive and non-negative neoantigens in the context of 3D genome and discovered that 1) DNA loci of the immuno- positive neoantigens tend to cluster genome-wise. 2) DNA loci of the immuno- positive neoantigens tend to belong to active chromosomal compartment (compartment A) in some chromosomes. 3). DNA loci of the immuno- positive neoantigens tend to locate at specific regions in the 3D genome. We believe that the 3D genome information will help more precise neoantigen prioritization and discovery and eventually benefit precision and personalized medicine in cancer immunotherapy.",

        "abstract": "The genome 3D architecture is thought to be related to regulating gene expression levels in cells and can be explained by genome-wide chromatin interactions which have been explored by chromosome conformation capture based techniques, especially Hi-C. Based on experimental data, we developed a new method to construct consistent 3D structures, enabling intact genome structures in single nucleus to be examined under 10kb resolution for the first time. The constructed structures showed marked variations of 3D genome organization across different cells. However, chromosome loci marked by different proteins, such as CTCF and post-translationally modified histones, are consistently non-specifically aggregated in space. Interestingly, similar aggregations between active enhancers and active promoters were observed, especially for those separated by genomic regions of the scale of megabase or larger. Such long-range associations between active enhancers and promoters are strongly correlated with spatial aggregation of chromosome loci marked by different proteins. Through analyzing the 3D structures of intact genome, we proposed that coherent gene activation profiles among individual cells can be achieved by the consistent aggregation of protein marked loci instead of maintaining identical folded conformations.",

Spatial distribution analysis showed that the highest concentrations were recorded in the north-western, south-western, and mid-eastern parts of the study area. The index of geo-accumulation and pollution index indicated modest enrichment with Cd and Hg, which were the only two metals posing a potentially high ecological risk to the local agricultural environment. The health risk assessment showed no considerable non-carcinogenic or carcinogenic risks for children and adults from these elements. The principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) found that the variations in the Cr and Ni concentrations were largely on account of the soil parent rocks, but the As, Cd, Cu, and Hg variations in the soil were largely owing to agricultural practices of years. However, the main factor influencing Pb and Zn was atmospheric deposition.",

        "abstract": "Samples of surface soil from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) fields were analysed for heavy metals and showed the following concentrations (mean of 246 samples, mg/kg): As, 5.10; Cd, 0.11; Cr, 49.49; Cu, 14.72; Hg, 0.08; Ni, 19.28; Pb. 20.20 and Zn, 30.76. The values of the index of geoaccumulation (I ) and of the enrichment factor indicated modest enrichment with As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Ni or Pb. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis correctly allocated each investigated element to its source, whether anthropogenic or natural. The results were consistent with estimated inputs of heavy metals from fertilizers, irrigation water and atmospheric deposition. The variation in the concentrations of As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in the soil was mainly due to long-term agricultural practises, and that of Cr and Ni was mainly due to the soil parent material, whereas the source of Hg was industrial activity, which ultimately led to atmospheric deposition. Atmospheric deposition was the main exogenous source of heavy metals, and fertilizers also played an important role in the accumulation of these elements in soil. Identifying the sources of heavy metals in agricultural soils can serve as a basis for appropriate action to control and reduce the addition of heavy metals to cultivated soils.",

        "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) contamination is one of the most serious global environmental problems, and phytoremediation, which uses Cd-accumulator plants, is potentially one of the sustainable solutions. Pot experiments with natural and Cd-amended soils were conducted to investigate the accumulation of heavy metals in 10 leading cultivars of tobacco in China. The extraction ability and profiles of Cd accumulation among plant organs were also analyzed. The tobacco roots accumulated cobalt, nickel, and Cd, while the leaf highly bioaccumulated Cd and lowly accumulated zinc, selenium and mercury. The transport from the tobacco stem to the leaf plays a critical role in the accumulation of these elements. The ratios of Cd concentration in the leaves at lower, middle and upper positions were comparatively stable. The high Cd-extracting cultivars were \"Hongda\", \"NC89\" and \"Zhongyan 100\" when grown in normal soils, \"CuiBi 1\" and \"Hongda\" in moderately contaminated soils, and \"YuYan 87\", \"LongJiang 851\" and \"K326\" in severely contaminated soils. Tobacco leaves could accumulate about 80% of the total Cd extracted from the soil by the plant. Considering the Cd-extraction limitations exhibited by leading tobacco cultivars, screening of germplasm resources for high or low levels of Cd-accumulation is still an important target for the future.",

In addition, its composite with graphene nanosheets of about six layers of graphene was achieved. Both of them, especially the Li3VO4/graphene nanosheets composite, show superior electrochemical performance to the formerly reported vanadium-based anode materials. The composite shows a reversible capacity of 223 mAh g(-1) even at 20C (1C = 400 mAh g(-1)). After 500 cycles at 10C there is no evident capacity fading.",

However, in the literature, there is hardly any attention aimed at enhancing the data processing capability of the system, the necessity and significance of which are undisputed. This paper, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, analyzed the intrinsic superiority of employing GPU parallel computation in \u03d5-OTDR for improving the data processing capability and presented a comprehensive performance evaluation. Three typical, frequently implemented algorithms in \u03d5-OTDR-moving average, batch fast Fourier transform, and batch correlation dimension computation-are carried out where CPU-based programs and counterpart GPU-based programs are, respectively, developed. Their time-consuming performances in different data scales are experimentally tested and compared. The experiment results show that in each case, employing GPU parallel computation can significantly enhance the system's data processing capacity, thus providing a feasible and efficient way of guaranteeing real-time operation with the growing data scale.",

A locating method based on the correlation dimension (CDM) in phase- sensitive optical time domain reflectometry is proposed.

A segment of EDF is spliced in the middle of the sensing fiber with the pump power injected from the front end to realize power compensation such as a repeater. The 75-km sensing distance under single-end operating scheme and the 10-dB tail-end SNR are demonstrated. Since the method eliminates the necessity of dual-end operation and field power supply, it provides a much more practical and feasible way of realizing long-range perimeter monitoring.",

The theoretical basis behind this dual-wavelength pulse strategy is presented and an experimental setup is described to help validate the proposed strategy. Through the experimental tests, a 37.79% improvement in detection for available points along the fiber is achieved when 1550.000\u2009nm and 1550.138\u2009nm wavelength signals are applied. The different wavelength tests show that at least a 0.012\u2009nm or 1.498\u2009GHz difference should be applied in a dual-wavelength pulse and an average 30% detecting improvement can be achieved when one wavelength changes from 1549.950\u2009nm to 1550.100\u2009nm. In addition, the dual-wavelength strategy makes the system response more stable and consistent along the sensing optical fiber.",

        "abstract": "A phase-sensitive optical time domain reflectometer (\u03a6-OTDR) can be used for pipeline security. However, the sensing distance (less than 20 km) of traditional \u03a6-OTDR is too short for the needs of typical oil and gas pipeline monitoring applications (30-50 km). A simple structure \u03a6-OTDR system utilizing long pulse, balanced amplified detector and heterodyne detection is proposed in this paper and the sensing range is thereby increased to 60 km. Through analyzing the sensing principle of \u03a6-OTDR, a novel locating strategy is proposed to maintain the locating accuracy at a few meters when a long pulse (5 \u00b5s) is used. The increased pulse width deteriorates the time series of each sensing point seriously. In order to eliminate the deterioration, a data processing technique combining wavelet and empirical mode decomposition is applied in this system. The experiment results show that the sensing distance can be increased to 60 km and the locating accuracy is maintained at 6.8 m. ",

Although IN has been studied from information theoretic perspective, its potential for a general multi-hop wireless network has not been explored. The goal of this paper is to understand IN in a multi-hop wireless network from networking perspective. We first establish an IN reference model. Based on this reference model, we develop a set of feasibility constraints for a subset of links to be active simultaneously. By identifying each eligible neutralization node (called neut), we study IN in a general multi-hop network and develop a set of necessary constraints to characterize neut selection, IN, and scheduling. These constraints allow us to study the performance of multi-hop networks without the need of getting involved into onerous signal design issues at the physical layer. Finally, we apply our IN model and constraints to study a throughput maximization problem and show that the use of IN can generally increase network throughput. In particular, throughput gain is most significant when the node density increases.",

Conventional wisdom of addressing this issue is to live with this disadvantage by inserting a guard interval to introduce immunity to propagation delays. Recent advances in interference alignment (IA) open up a new direction to address this issue and promise a great potential to improve network throughput by exploiting large propagation delays. In this paper, we investigate propagation delay-based IA (PD-IA) in multi-hop UWA networks. We first develop a set of simple constraints to characterize PD-IA feasible region at the physical layer. Based on the set of PD-IA constraints, we develop a distributed PD-IA scheduling algorithm to greedily maximize interference overlapping possibilities in a multi-hop UWA network. Simulation results show that the proposed PD-IA algorithm yields higher throughput than an idealized benchmark algorithm without propagation delays, indicating that large propagation delays are not adversarial but beneficial for network throughput performance.",

        "abstract": "Underlay is an aggressive spectrum sharing paradigm that allows secondary nodes to be active simultaneously with the primary nodes through interference cancelation (IC). In this paper, we design an online admission control algorithm to handle dynamic session arrival and departure in the underlay coexistence paradigm for multi-hop primary and secondary networks. For IC, we employ multiple antennas at each secondary node. Through distributed computation and degree-of-freedom (DoF) allocation at each secondary node, our algorithm ensures that all interference to/from the multi-hop primary network and interference within the multi-hop secondary network are canceled properly so that data transport is free of interference in both multi-hop primary and secondary networks. Further, we show that the DoF allocation by our algorithm is feasible (implementable) at the physical layer at all time. Through extensive performance evaluation, we find that our online admission control algorithm can offer competitive performance when compared to an offline centralized algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Existing spectrum sharing paradigms have set clear boundaries between the primary and secondary networks. There is either no or very limited node-level cooperation between the primary and secondary networks. In this paper, we develop a new and bold spectrum-sharing paradigm beyond the state of the art for future wireless networks. We explore network cooperation as a new dimension for spectrum sharing between the primary and secondary users. Such network cooperation can be defined as a set of policies under which different degrees of cooperation are to be achieved. The benefits of this paradigm are numerous, as they allow integrating resources from two networks. There are many possible node-level cooperation policies that one can employ under this paradigm. For the purpose of performance study, we consider a specific policy called United cooperation of Primary and Secondary (UPS) networks. UPS allows a complete cooperation between the primary and secondary networks at the node level to relay each other's traffic. As a case study, we consider a problem with the goal of supporting the rate requirement of the primary network traffic while maximizing the throughput of the secondary sessions. For this problem, we develop an optimization model and formulate a combinatorial optimization problem. We also develop an approximation solution based on a piece-wise linearization technique. Simulation results show that UPS offers significantly better throughput performance than that under the interweave paradigm.",

        "abstract": "Interference alignment (IA) is widely regarded as a promising interference management technique in wireless networks. Despite its rapid advances in cellular networks, most results of IA are limited to information-theoretic exploration or physical-layer signal design. Little progress has been made so far to advance IA in cellular networks from a networking perspective. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by studying IA in large-scale cellular networks. For the uplink, we propose an OFDM-based IA scheme and prove its feasibility at the physical layer by showing that all data streams in the IA scheme can be transported free of interference. Based on the IA scheme, we develop a cross-layer IA optimization framework that can fully translate the benefits of IA to throughput gain in cellular networks. Furthermore, we show that the IA optimization problem in the downlink can be solved in the exactly same way as that in the uplink. Simulation results show that our OFDM-based IA scheme can significantly increase the user throughput and the throughput gain increases with user density in the network.",

        "abstract": "Transforming growth factor-\u03b2-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) plays an essential role in the tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1)-and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2)-induced I\u03baB kinase (IKK)/nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/activator protein 1 (AP-1) activation. Here we report that TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induce Lys63-linked TAK1 polyubiquitination at the Lys158 residue within the kinase domain. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors 2 and 6 (TRAF2 and -6) act as the ubiquitin E3 ligases to mediate Lys63-linkedTAK1polyubiquitination at the Lys158 residue in vivo and in vitro. Lys63-linked TAK1 polyubiquitination at the Lys158 residue is required for TAK1-mediated IKK complex recruitment. Reconstitution of TAK1-deficient mouse embryo fibroblast cells with TAK1 wild type or a TAK1 mutant containing a K158R mutation revealed the importance of this site in TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2-mediated IKK/NF-\u03baB and JNK/AP-1 activation as well as IL-6 gene expression. Our findings demonstrate that Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of TAK1 at Lys158 is essential for its own kinase activation and its ability to mediate its downstream signal transduction pathways in response to TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 stimulation. \u00a9 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",

Two additional boundary conditions, namely, the continuity of first order pressure of free electron density and the continuity of normal components of free charge velocity, respectively, are adopted in order to handle the behaviour at interfaces involving metals. Scattering matrices at interfaces can be readily obtained and cascaded to obtain the modal coefficients in each layer by expanding electromagnetic waves in harmonic modes with cylindrical vector wave functions. We have validated the proposed method by analyzing the optical responses of several configurations of nanostructures, including a bi-metallic nanocylinder and a hyperlens. We found that nonlocal effects can be important for small structures, when the characteristic...",

        "abstract": "Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, also named G proteins, play a vital role as molecular switches in signal transduction cascades initiated by the activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Inactive G proteins are heterotrimers that contain an \u03b1 subunit and a \u03b2\u03b3 subunit. GDP occupies a binding pocket within the G\u03b1 subunit. GPCRs are activated by agonist binding, which induces conformational changes in the GPCRs that allow the association of their corresponding trimeric G proteins and promote the exchange of GDP to GTP within the G\u03b1 subunit. GTP binding causes conformational changes within the \u201cswitch\u201d regions of the G\u03b1 subunit, thus leading to dissociation of the GTP-bound G\u03b1 subunit and the G\u03b2\u03b3 dimer, which separately interact with downstream effectors. The slow intrinsic GTPase activity of the G\u03b1 subunit catalyzes the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, thereby returning the G\u03b1 subunit to an inactivated state and resulting in re-association of the G\u03b1 and G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits, which terminates the signal transduction. Since the 1990s, high resolution crystal structures of the various stages of the G protein cycle in its active (GTP\u03b3S bound)1,2,3, deactivated (GDP bound)4,5, inactive (G\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 complex)6,7,8 and downstream effector-bound9,10,11 states have been determined. In combination with extensive physiological and pharmacological studies, these structures shed light on the molecular basis for the function of heterotrimeric G proteins. The first structure of a GPCR-G protein complex, which was released in 2011, was a milestone12 that provided a comprehensive structural basis for transmembrane signaling by GPCRs and G proteins. A recent breakthrough, the structure of the rhodopsin-arrestin complex, provides the basis for understanding the blocking of GPCR coupling to G proteins and arrestin-biased signaling13. These crystallographic studies have revealed three regions with major conformational differences between the GDP- and GTP-bound conformations of G\u03b1, termed the switch I\u2013III regions. Conformational changes in these regions are directly linked to the guanine nucleotide-binding domain, which is formed by five conserved loops called G1\u2013G5 boxes (Figure 1). The G1\u2013G3 boxes play a critical role in coordinating the \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-phosphate groups and Mg2+, whereas the G4\u2013G5 boxes form the guanine ring-binding site. Multiple steps in the G protein cycle can be interrupted by mutations in the G\u03b1 subunit, especially in the guanine nucleotide-binding pocket. These mutations cause the G protein cycle to be blocked, and the mutations have been used to delineate the GPCR-initiated signaling pathways. Several signaling-blocking mutations in the G\u03b1 subunit are dominant negative (DN) mutations, because they can block agonist-activated GPCR signaling in the presence of wild type G proteins. To date, there are three known mechanisms for DN mutation: the sequestration of the G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits in a complex that is unable to bind activated GPCRs, the sequestration of the activated GPCR by a heterotrimeric complex that cannot exchange GDP and GTP, and the sequestration of the activated GPCR by nucleotide-free G\u03b114. Because GPCRs are targets for as many as 50% of drugs on the market, DN G proteins have been extensively used to delineate G protein signaling pathways and represent a promising tool to study GPCR-dependent signaling. A large number of mutants with DN phenotypes have been identified for various types of G proteins: S54N in G\u03b1s15, S47C in G\u03b1o16, S48C in G\u03b1i217, G226A in G\u03b1s18, G203T in G\u03b1o19, D273N in G\u03b1o20, and D277N in G\u03b11121. Moreover, multiple DN G\u03b1 mutations have been combined to overcome conditional, nonselective, and weak mutant phenotypes14. For example, a triple G\u03b1 mutant, \u03b13\u03b25/G226A/A366S, almost completely inhibits G\u03b1-mediated signaling22, in which the \u03b13\u03b25 mutations replace five G residues in the \u03b13 helix and the \u03b13\u03b25 loops with homologous G\u03b1i residues (N271K, K274D, R280K, T284D, and I285T), which exhibit an enhanced affinity for GPCR. The G226A mutation stabilizes G\u03b2\u03b3 binding, impairs the affinity of GTP, and prohibits the GTP-induced conformational change23. The A366S mutation decreases the affinity for GDP and GTP\u03b3S, probably by steric hindrance, and restrains G\u03b1s in the empty nucleotide pocket state24. However, most DN phenotypes have been analyzed only functionally, whereas most structural studies have focused on G\u03b1 subunits with single mutations rather than G protein heterotrimers8,25,26. In contrast, the precise mechanisms of signal disruption in the context of G protein heterotrimers remain largely elusive. To gain further insight into the DN mechanism of the Gi heterotrimer, we constructed a multiple DN mutant, G\u03b1i G203A/A326S, which corresponds to the G226A and A366S mutations in G\u03b1s, and determined its crystal structure. Static light scattering was used to evaluate the average molecular mass of the Gi-DN heterotrimer. The SEC elution profile, together with light scattering data and the differential refractive index signals, exhibited single peaks, thus indicating that the Gi-DN heterotrimer is highly homogeneous. A molecular mass of 90 kDa was determined by using multi-angle static light scattering, and this measurement was consistent with the calculated mass of the untagged Gi-DN heterotrimer (86.4 kDa) (Figure 2C). We determined the stability of the Gi-DN heterotrimer by using a thermal shift assay. In the absence of exogenous GDP, the Gi-DN heterotrimer presented a lower Tm value (55.3 \u00b0C) than wild-type heterotrimer (61.1 \u00b0C), thus indicating that the decreased stability of the Gi heterotrimer was caused by G203A/A326S mutations. Additionally, in the presence of 200 \u03bcmol/L GDP, the Tm value of the Gi-DN heterotrimer increased from 55.3 \u00b0C to 60.0 \u00b0C, thus demonstrating that the Gi-DN heterotrimer was further stabilized by GDP (Figure 2D) and retained the capability to bind GDP. The conformation of the Gi-DN heterotrimer resembles that of the GDP-bound wild-type heterotrimer (PDB code 1GP2), with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.87 \u00c5. Similarly to the wild-type Gi heterotrimer, the C-terminus of the G\u03b3 subunit (E63-S68) and the N-terminus of the G\u03b1i1 subunits (M1-L5) could not be traced in the crystal structure of the Gi-DN heterotrimer. The 3\u00d7GSA linker between them also could not be traced, thus indicating that these flexible regions are less likely to affect the structure of the Gi-DN heterotrimer. Compared with the wild type structure, nearly all helices and loops in the G\u03b1i subunit undergo movements accompanied by the subtle displacement of the G\u03b1iAH domain away from G\u03b1iRas domain. The \u03b2 propeller, consisting of seven repeat blades of G\u03b2, also adopts a changed conformation through rotation, and this rotation is probably caused by the rearrangement of the G\u03b1i subunit. Another notable structural difference between the Gi-DN and wild-type heterotrimer is the rotation and displacement of the parallel \u03b1-helical coiled coil formed by the amino terminus of the G\u03b2 and G\u03b3 subunits toward the G\u03b1i subunit (Figure 3B). We performed an analysis of the polar and hydrophobic interactions between GDP and the Gi-DN and wild-type heterotrimers by using the Ligplot+ program40. Although the extent of the Van der Waals interactions does not substantially differ, the hydrogen bonding network is rearranged. Compared with wild-type, the Gi-DN heterotrimer forms two extra hydrogen bonds between G1 box residues S47 and T44 and the \u03b1- and \u03b2-phosphates of GDP but loses four hydrogen bonds between the G4 box residues N269, K270, and D272 and the purine base of GDP (Figure 4B and 4C). The loss of two net hydrogen bonds indicates an attenuated GDP affinity for the Gi-DN heterotrimer. This speculation is supported by previous evidence that the A326S and G203A mutations in the G\u03b1i subunit as well as the homologous mutations G226A and A366S in the G\u03b1s subunit impair the affinity of the G\u03b1 subunit for GDP/GTP\u03b3S23,24,25,26. To understand why the A326S mutation attenuates GDP binding, we also performed mABP-biased MD simulations of the WT\u0394HD and DN\u0394HD GDP-bound G\u03b1i monomer with the helical domain (\u0394HD; herein referred to as WT and DN) removed39. Interestingly, significant changes in the conformational dynamics of the A326S-containing G5 box were observed between the WT and DN G\u03b1i. In contrast to the WT simulations, the introduction of a polar residue at A326S decreased the stability of the G5 box in both DN simulations and allowed it to move upward, 10 \u00c5 away from its crystallographic position (Figure 4D and 4E). From these simulations, it can be inferred that the A326S mutation destabilizes the binding pocket and thus may also contribute to the lower binding affinity for GDP and GTP. G203, which is located in the G3 box loop, provides critical contacts for the \u03b3-phosphate of GTP. To analyze the influence of the G203A mutation on GTP binding, we built a model of the GTP-bound form of Gi-DN based on the structure of the GTP\u03b3S-occupied G\u03b1i A326S mutant protein (PDB code 1BH2)25 by using SWISS-MODEL41. A steric clash between A203 and GTP was observed according to the alignment between the model and 1BH2 (Figure 5A), and the G3 box is rearranged, thus possibly reducing the steric conflict caused by the G203A mutation. In the DN-mutated structure, the backbone amide nitrogen atom of A203 is hydrogen-bonded to the backbone oxygen atom of T181 in the G2 loop, which contributes to the coordination of Mg2+ in the GTP-bound state. This hydrogen bond contact may cause the rearrangement, in which the G2 box moves toward the G3 box (Figure 5B). A326 is located within 3.6 \u00c5 of the N7 atom of the guanine ring in the wild type Gi structure (PDB code 1GP2), and the A326S mutation is expected to cause a steric clash between the guanine ring and the slightly larger side chain of the A326S mutation. In the A326S mutant structure, the steric conflict between S326 and the purine base of GDP pushes GDP away from the S326 residue. The serine hydroxyl group is directed into the core of the Ras-like domain and forms a hydrogen bond with N269, thereby causing a conformational change in the residues in the G4 box. The shift of the guanine ring also distorts the perfect geometry of the hydrogen bonds between the carboxylate group of D272 and the two amine groups (N1 and N2) of the guanine base (Figure 5C). The combination of GDP displacement and the rearrangements of residues in the G4 box leads to the weakening of the binding of the A326S mutant to the guanine nucleotide (Figure 5D). The amino-terminal helix of G\u03b1i packs across the D strands of blade 1 and blade 7 of G\u03b2. In the Gi-DN structure, the \u03b1N helix of the G\u03b1i subunit undergoes a rotation and displacement away from blade 7 and toward blade 1 (Figure 6D), thus resulting in the loss of an ionic interaction between the oxygen atom of the D20 side chain in the G\u03b1i subunit and the guanidyl group of R52, which is located in the D strand of blade 7 of the G\u03b2 subunit. This displacement also creates two extra hydrogen bonds between the \u03b1N helix of G\u03b1i subunit and the D strand of blade 1 of the G\u03b2 subunit; the R15 guanidyl group is hydrogen bonded to the backbone oxygen atom of V90 and the ND1 atom in the imidazole ring of H91 (Figure 6B and 6C, Table 2). Interface 2 mainly consists of switch II, which is also critical for the binding of the \u03b3-phosphate of GTP and the coordination of Mg2+. Thus, the exchange of GDP for GTP or the hydrolysis of GTP is closely associated with the affinity of the interaction between the G\u03b1i and G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits. The switch II displacement of the Gi-DN heterotrimer differs from that of wild type for nearly every residue in switch II. Additionally, the \u03b2 propeller loops at the G\u03b1i-G\u03b2 interface also adopt a changed conformation. The resultant conformational changes in G\u03b1i and G\u03b2 lead to distinct contacts in interface 2 (Figure 6E\u20136G). For example, N119 in G\u03b2 extends toward the G\u03b1i subunit and forms two additional hydrogen bonds with the backbone oxygen atom and the hydroxyl oxygen of T182 in switch I, while the hydrogen bond between E186 in the G\u03b1i subunit and W99 in the G\u03b2 subunit is broken by a 1 \u00c5 outward movement of the \u03b22 strand (Figure 6E and 6F, Table 2). A complete comparison of the interactions in the G\u03b1i-G\u03b2 interface shows that the Gi-DN heterotrimer has three more pairs of polar contacts than the wild type complex (Table 2), consistently with the increased size of the buried interface, suggesting increased stability of G\u03b1-G\u03b2 interaction in the Gi-DN heterotrimer. The more extensive interactions at the G\u03b1-G\u03b2\u03b3 interface have been supported by previous reports. The G203A mutation in G\u03b1i and the homologous G226A mutation in G\u03b1s inhibit the conformational changes that occur after GTP binding and consequently inhibit the release of G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits18,26. The penetration of the C-terminal \u03b15 helix of the G protein into the cytoplasmic core of the transmembrane bundle of the activated GPCRs is one of the most striking structural features of the GPCR-G protein interaction. The substitution of A326 with S alters the conformation of the \u03b26-\u03b15 loop, leading to a distinct shift in the \u03b15 helix of the G\u03b1 subunit in the Gi-DN heterotrimer, although this shift is smaller in magnitude compared with the one in the receptor-bound state of G\u03b1s\u03b2\u03b3 in the structure of the \u03b22AR-G\u03b1s\u03b2\u03b3 complex (Figure 7E). Overall, we conclude that the Gi-DN heterotrimer shares features of the G protein in a receptor-bound state. To reveal the molecular mechanism by which T48F and D272F block GDP binding, we built two mutant protein homology models based on the structure of human G\u03b1i1 G202A (PDB code 3UMS)42. The benzene ring of F48 in the model sterically interferes with the position of the ribose ring (Figure 8G), and F272 almost overlaps with the guanine base, which would prevent GDP access to the pocket (Figure 8H) and further destabilize the Gi-DN heterotrimer. Several dominant negative G\u03b1 subunits have been developed to investigate GPCR-G protein signaling pathways. Despite the progress that has been made in understanding the DN effects of G proteins in terms of functional evaluations, the molecular mechanisms of GPCR-dependent signal disruption by DN mutants remains elusive because of the scarcity of the structural evidence for G protein heterotrimers. Here, we solved the structure of G203A and A326S mutated G\u03b1i1\u03b21\u03b32, and we provide the first report of the DN mechanism caused by these mutations. By comparing the structure of the wild type Gi heterotrimer, we observed subtle conformation changes in the nucleotide-binding pocket that attenuate the affinity for GDP, more extensive contacts in the interface between the G\u03b1 subunit and G\u03b2\u03b3-dimer, a distinct displacement of the N-terminal helices of both G\u03b2 and G\u03b3 subunits and a stretch upward of the \u03b1C helix in the G\u03b1 subunit. In addition, molecular dynamic analysis indicated that the nucleotide-binding pocket of G\u03b1 is greatly destabilized by G203A/A326S mutations, thus potentially contributing to its lower binding affinity for GDP and GTP. We speculate that the Gi-DN heterotrimer is characterized by a reduced affinity for both GDP and GTP, leading to a preference for a nucleotide-free state. Thus, the Gi-DN protein fails to accomplish the exchange of GDP for GTP and loses the ability to be activated. The enhanced interaction of the G\u03b1 subunit with G\u03b2\u03b3 also prevents the dissociation of G\u03b2\u03b3 from the heterotrimer, thereby preventing downstream effector activation by the separate subunits. Surprisingly, the Gi-DN heterotrimer adopts the structural features of the G protein in the receptor-bound state, indicating that Gi-DN is in a state that interacts more easily with activated GPCR than wild type G proteins. The Gi-DN heterotrimer attenuates the binding of activated GPCRs with endogenous wild type G proteins in two different ways. First, it sequesters G\u03b2\u03b3 with a relatively more potent binding capability, consequently preventing the wild-type G\u03b1 from binding to G\u03b2\u03b3, a process indispensable for binding to the activated GPCR. In addition, the Gi-DN heterotrimer preferentially occupies an activated GPCR, thus decreasing the possibility of the stimulation of other wild type G proteins by GPCR and blocking the physiological transducing signal of GPCR. We also found that two extra mutations in the GDP binding pocket have the potential to abolish GDP binding by the Gi-DN heterotrimer. The Gi-DN heterotrimer with mutations T48F and D272F, together with G203A/A326S, did not display a thermal shift after incubation with GDP, thus that these two mutations are likely to abolish GDP binding completely and to lead to a nucleotide-free state of the Gi heterotrimer. This result is consistent with the rationale for the T48F and D272F mutations, which is that the large side chains of the mutated phenyalanine interfere with the binding of the G\u03b1i subunit to the guanine ring. Dominant negative G proteins are frequently used to delineate GPCR-mediated signaling pathways and to exhibit potential usefulness in therapeutic applications43. The dominant negative mechanism revealed in this study provides a solid structural basis for the design of more potent mutants. However, the structural study of the GPCR-G protein complex is crucial to the research of overall GPCR signal pathways; however, the GPCR-G protein complex is difficult to crystallize because of its considerable instability when binding to GDP or GTP. In the structural study of the \u03b22AR-Gs complex, GDP was removed from its binding pocket by apyrase12 to diminish the influence of GDP. As we characterized previously, the DN-Gi mutant appears to stabilize the G\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3-receptor complex with a reduced nucleotide affinity. Dominant negative G proteins are expected to favor the stability of the GPCR-G protein complex and to provide an alternative means for the structural study of the GPCR-G protein complex.

In addition to G signaling cascade mediated by these three 5-HT receptors, the ERK1/2 signaling which is dependent on cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production and protein kinase A (PKA) activation downstream of G signaling has also been widely studied. In this study, we investigated these two signaling pathways originating from the three G-coupled 5-HT receptors in AD293 cells. We found that the phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/2 are ligand-induced, in contrast to the constitutively active G signaling. This indicates that G signaling alone is not sufficient for ERK1/2 activation in these three 5-HT receptors. In addition to G, we found that \u03b2-arrestin and Fyn are essential for the activation of ERK1/2. Together, these results put forth a novel mechanism for ERK1/2 activation involving the cooperative action of G, \u03b2-arrestin, and Fyn.",

        "abstract": "The polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) catalyzes the methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27) to generate trimethyl-H3K27 (H3K27me3) marks, thereby leading to a repressive chromatin state that inhibits gene expression. C10ORF12 was recently identified as a novel PRC2 interactor. Here, we show that C10ORF12 specifically interacts with PRC2 through its middle region (positions 619-718). C10ORF12 significantly enhances the histone methyltransferase activity of PRC2 in vitro and dramatically increases the total H3K27me3 levels in HeLa cells. C10ORF12 also antagonizes Jarid2, which is an auxiliary factor of the PRC2.2 subcomplex, to promote increased H3K27me3 levels in HeLa cells. Moreover, C10ORF12 alters the substrate preference of PRC2. These results indicate that C10ORF12 functions as a positive regulator of PRC2 and facilitates PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 modification of chromatin. These findings provide new insight into the roles of C10ORF12 in regulating the activity of the PRC2 complex.",

The photophysical behaviors, especially the oxygen pressure sensitivity of pressure sensitive film are not only affected by the luminescence probes, but also by the polymer matrix.The photophysical behaviors of the pressure sensitive films composed of platinum tetra(pentafluorophyenyl)porphine (PtTFPP) in the polymer matrix of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polybutylmethacrylate (PBMA), ethyl cellulose (EC) or ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) were investigated in this article. The results confirmed that all of the oxygen permeability of the polymer matrix, the molecular interaction between the probes and polymer and the depth distribution of the probes in the polymer matrix showed significant influence on the photophysical properties, oxygen quenching and pressure sensitivity of the pressure sensitive films.",

While aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) editing potentially provides a mechanism to reject np AAs, some have pathological associations. Co-crystal structures show that vegetable-sourced azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (Aze), a dual mimic of proline and alanine, is activated by both human prolyl- and alanyl-tRNA synthetases. However, it inserts into proteins as proline, with toxic consequences in vivo. Thus, dual mimicry increases odds for mistranslation through evasion of one but not both tRNA synthetase editing systems.",

        "abstract": "AbstractBrain and heart pathologies are caused by editing defects of transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases, which preserve genetic code fidelity by removing incorrect amino acids misattached to tRNAs. To extend understanding of the broader impact of synthetase editing reactions on organismal homeostasis, and based on effects in bacteria ostensibly from small amounts of mistranslation of components of the replication apparatus, we investigated the sensitivity to editing of the vertebrate genome. We show here that in zebrafish embryos, transient overexpression of editing-defective valyl-tRNA synthetase (ValRSED) activated DNA break-responsive H2AX and p53-responsive downstream proteins, such as cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21, which promotes cell-cycle arrest at DNA damage checkpoints, and Gadd45 and p53R2, with pivotal roles in DNA repair. In contrast, the response of these proteins to expression of ValRSED was abolished in p53-deficient fish. The p53-activated downstream signaling events correlated with suppression of abnormal morphological changes caused by the editing defect and, in adults, reversed a shortened life span (followed for 2 y). Conversely, with normal editing activities, p53-deficient fish have a normal life span and few morphological changes. Whole-fish deep sequencing showed genomic mutations associated with the editing defect. We suggest that the sensitivity of p53 to expression of an editing-defective tRNA synthetase has a critical role in promoting genome integrity and organismal homeostasis.",

Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) can be precisely designed for wide spectral tuning of external broadband sources with subwavelength resolution. However, emission shifting of chromophores with LSPR is limited in range due to their narrowband emission. We report an alternative method of producing full-color tunability, by modulating the intensity of red, green, and blue peaks of gradient alloy cadmium\u2013zinc chalcogenide core/shell quantum dots (QDs) using LSPR of Ag nanopillar arrays. Photoluminescence enhancement is largely dependent on the Purcell effect and radiative scattering and is found to be highest when emission coincides with the resonance wavelength. Red, green, and blue subpixels with dimensions of 480, 312, and 225 nm, respectively, can be generated in a single patterning step (equivalent to 24\u202f500 ppi), which far exceeds ...",

        "abstract": "In this study, we determine the relationship between the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene A (MICA) in gastric cancer tumors after D2 gastrectomy and the clinical outcome of a CIK-containing adjuvant therapy. Ninety-five consecutive patients with gastric cancer after D2 gastrectomy who received adjuvant chemotherapy combined with CIK cell therapy were enrolled. The MICA expression of their tumors was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). High expression of MICA protein was documented by IHC in 38 of 95 tumor samples (40.0\u00a0%). The MICA status was significantly associated with the age and stage, p\u00a0=\u00a00.008 and 0.023, respectively. Analysis of NKG2D on in vitro expanded CIK cells showed that the percentages of NKG2D+ in CD3+/CD56+, CD3\u2212/CD56+, and CD3+/CD8+ cells populations were 97.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4, 97.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8, and 95.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1\u00a0%, respectively. For patient with high MICA-expressing tumors, the median DFS and OS were longer than for the patients with tumors with low expression of MICA; 46.0 versus 41.0\u00a0months (p\u00a0=\u00a00.027), and 48.0 versus 42.0\u00a0months (p\u00a0=\u00a00.031), respectively. In a multivariate analysis, stage and MICA expression were independent prognostic factors for DFS and OS. Our findings show that adjuvant chemotherapy plus CIK therapy treatment is a promising modality for treating gastric cancer patients after D2 gastrectomy. Especially, those who have tumors with high expression of MICA were more likely to benefit from such a treatment strategy. Subsequent studies in clinical trial cohorts will be required to confirm the clinical utility of these markers.",

The EGFR and PTEN expression was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC).A total of 158 mCRC patients with wild-type KRAS status were enrolled in the study; 51 patients received chemotherapy combined with cetuximab, 107 patients received chemotherapy alone. Patients who received chemotherapy combined with cetuximab had longer overall survival (OS) compared with patients who received chemotherapy alone. High EGFR expression was detected in 60 patients (38.0%), while normal PTEN expression was detected in 60 patients (59.5%). The PTEN status was significantly related with the histological grade. For patients who received chemotherapy combined with cetuximab the median OS of patients with high-expression of EGFR was longer than the OS of patients with low EGRF expression; 25.0 versus 19.0 months, P\u200a=\u200a0.002. For patient with normal PTEN the median OS were longer than the median OS for patients with loss of PTEN; 24.0 versus 19.0 months, P\u200a=\u200a0.026. The overall response rate (ORR) had a borderline association with EGFR and PTEN expression (P\u200a=\u200a0.055 and 0.048, respectively). In a multivariate analysis, ECOG PS, EGFR status, chemotherapy\u200a\u00b1\u200acetuximab, and the interaction of EGFR or PTEN and chemotherapy\u200a\u00b1\u200acetuximab were independent prognostic factors for OS.Our findings show that chemotherapy combined with cetuximab demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity for mCRC patients with wild-type KRAS status.

With the redevelopment of sites and changes in land-use type associated with these sites, substantial amounts of contaminated soils now require remediation. Since China is a developing country, soil remediation warrants the usage of techniques that are suitable for addressing the unique challenges faced in this country. Land shortage is a common problem in China; the large numbers of contaminated sites, tight development schedules, and limited financial resources necessitate the development of cost-effective methods for land reclamation. Mechanical soil aeration is a simple, effective, and low-cost soil remediation technique that is particularly suitable for the remediation of large volatile organic compound-contaminated sites. Its effectiveness has been confirmed by conducting laboratory studies, pilot tests, and full-scale projects. This study reviews current engineering practice and developmental trends of mechanical soil aeration and analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of this technology for application in China as an emerging soil remediation market. The findings of this study might aid technology development in China, as well as assist other developing countries in the assessment and implementation of costeffective hazardous waste site soil remediation programs.Open image in new window",

        "abstract": "Mechanical soil aeration is used for soil remediation at sites contaminated by volatile organic compounds. However, the effectiveness of the method is limited by low soil temperature, high soil moisture, and high soil viscosity. Combined with mechanical soil aeration, quicklime has a practical application value related to reinforcement remediation and to its action in the remediation of soil contaminated with volatile organic compounds. In this study, the target pollutant was trichloroethylene, which is a volatile chlorinated hydrocarbon pollutant commonly found in contaminated soils. A restoration experiment was carried out, using a set of mechanical soil-aeration simulation tests, by adding quicklime (mass ratios of 3, 10, and 20%) to the contaminated soil. The results clearly indicate that quicklime changed the physical properties of the soil, which affected the environmental behaviour of trichloroethylene in the soil. The addition of CaO increased soil temperature and reduced soil moisture to improve the mass transfer of trichloroethylene. In addition, it improved the macroporous cumulative pore volume and average pore size, which increased soil permeability. As soil pH increased, the clay mineral content in the soils decreased, the cation exchange capacity and the redox potential decreased, and the removal of trichloroethylene from the soil was enhanced to a certain extent. After the addition of quicklime, the functional group COO of soil organic matter could interact with calcium ions, which increased soil polarity and promoted the removal of trichloroethylene.",

        "abstract": "Most soil remediation studies investigated single contaminants or multiple contaminants of the same type. However, in field conditions, soils are often contaminated with potentially both toxic metals and organic pollutants, posing a serious technical challenge. Here, batch experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of combining in situ solidification/stabilization (ISS) and in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) for the simultaneous removal of aniline (1000 mg/kg) and Cd (10 mg/kg). All four tested ISS amendments, especially quick lime and Portland cement, promoted in situ chemical oxidation with activated persulfate in contaminated soil. Combined ISS/ISCO remediation effectively removed aniline and reduced the bioavailable Cd content at optimal initial persulfate and ISS amendment concentrations of 1.08 mol/kg and 30 wt% with a seven-day curing time, and significantly reduced leaching. Persulfate inhibited the reduction of the bioavailable Cd content, and ISS amendment with persulfate did not synergistically remediate Cd in co-contaminated soil. Strong alkalinity and high temperature were the main mechanisms driving rapid pollutant removal and immobilization. The reaction of CaO with water released heat, and Ca(OH)\u2082 formation increased the pH. The relative contributions of heat vs. alkaline activation, as well as the contaminant removal efficiency, increased with ISS amendment CaO content. Combined treatment altered the soil physicochemical properties, and significantly increased Ca and S contents. Activated persulfate-related reactions did not negatively impact unconfined compressive strength and hydraulic conductivity. This work improves the selection of persulfate activation methods for the treatment of soils co-contaminated with both potentially toxic metals and organic pollutants.",

The limit of quantitation of fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, norfloxacin were 2.67, 3.17, 4.75, 5.50ngmL, respectively. The recoveries of four quinolones range from 96.43 to 103.3% with relative standard deviations less than 4.5%.

        "abstract": "Here, one kind of hydrophilic hydroxypropyl \u03b2-cyclodextrin cross-linked polymer (HP-CDP) was prepared and used to establish a \"turn-on\" fluorescent probe for selective determination of captopril in biological samples. The HP-CDP has been synthesized in one step by cross-linking (2-hydroxypropyl)-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) with a rigid aromatic group linker tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile (TFT), and the synthesis parameters of HP-CDP were optimized with water solubility, yield, and adsorption capacity as indicators. When it was used as a luminescent material, we have found an interesting phenomenon that the fluorescence emission of HP-CDP was quenched after forming a coordination compound with ferric ions, and then recovered after adding a certain concentration of captopril, since captopril can reduce the ferric iron to ferrous ions and cause ligand replacement. Based on this observation, a novel turn-on fluorescent method was developed for the determination of captopril. The method exhibited good linearity in the range of 9.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910 to 4.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u00a0M (R\u2009=\u20090.9982) and a low detection limit of 1.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u00a0M at optimum HP-CDP concentration, ferric ion concentration, pH, and incubation time. Moreover, interference experiments demonstrated that this fluorescence sensor had excellent selectivity that can commendably resist the interference from potential foreign substances. The proposed method has been successfully applied to determine captopril in human urine samples and may provide outstanding application potential in the future development of sensors. In addition, it is believed that HP-CDP also has a wide range of applications, for example, as a solubilizer, pollutant adsorbent, or drug carrier. Graphical abstract \u115f.",

In this study, a novel solid phase extraction based on porous magnetic cyclodextrin polymer (MA-CD) was developed and used for detection of trace small molecule gastric tumor markers in urine samples. The adsorption properties of the magnetic cyclodextrin polymer were tested. Through experiments of the solid phase extraction (SPE) at the different condition, the optimal condition was selected to test the two tumor markers by High-performance-liquid chromatography -Diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). The analytical performance of the method showed good accuracy (88.82%-104.34%) and precision (<\u202f3.55%), appropriated detection limits (1.016 and 5.714\u202f\u03bcg\u202fL) and linear ranges (0.6-24.0\u202f\u03bcg\u202fL) with convenient determination coefficients (>\u202f0.9994). The results demonstrated that the developed approach is efficient, low-cost for gastric tumor markers detection.",

        "abstract": "Here, a porous superparamagnetic composite material magnetic \u03b2-cyclodextrin polymer (MNPs/\u03b2-CDP) was prepared and characterized as a adsorbent that may be used for the degradaion of acetaminophen (APAP) in aqueous solution by coupling with potassium permanganate (KMnO) oxidation. The results of adsorption properties investigation showed that the adsorption rate and capacity of MNPs/\u03b2-CDP were better than the component materials. When coupled with KMnO oxidation, the degradation efficiency were evaluated with regards to the pseudo-first-order kinetics of 4-CP degradation. As an oxidation reactor, the material effectively alleviated the secondary pollution and water coloration caused by oxidation of KMnO. Moreover, the materials were directly regenerated by the reaction of KMnO with APAP adsorbed in its cavities without additional elution treatment, making it more convenient and environmentally friendly. The repeated degradation experiments demonstrated that MNPs/\u03b2-CDP had mechanic stability and reusability. The findings provide novel ideas for the degradation of persistent contaminants in water environments.",

Besides, compared with the traditional HPC computing environments, such as grid and cluster which run HPC applications on bare-metal, cloud equipped with virtualization not only improves resource utilization but also reduces maintenance cost. While for some reasons, current virtualization-based cloud has limited performance for HPC. Such performance overhead could be caused by Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) interceptions, virtualized I/O devices or cross Virtual Machine (VM) interference, etc. In order to guarantee the performance of HPC applications on Cloud, the VMM should interfere guest VMs as less as possible and allocate dedicated resources such as CPU cores, DRAM and devices to guest VMs running HPC applications.  In this paper, we propose a novel cloud infrastructure to serve the HPC applications and normal applications concurrently. This novel infrastructure is based on a lightweight high performance VMM named nOSV. For HPC applications, nOSV constructs a strong isolated high performance guest VM with dedicated resources. At runtime, the high performance VM manages all resources by itself and is not interfered by nOSV. By supporting nested virtualization, nOSV can run HPC with commodity application and keep the flexibility of traditional Cloud. nOSV runs other virtualization environments, like Xen and Docker, as high performance guest VMs. All commodity Cloud applications are hosted in these virtualization environments and share hardware resources with each other. The prototype of nOSV shows that it provides a bare-metal like performance for HPC applications and has about 23% improvement compared to HPC applications running on Xen.",

        "abstract": "Despite public awareness of its deleterious effects, smoking remains a major cause of death. Indeed, it is a risk factor for atherothrombotic complications and in line with this, the introduction of smoking ban in public areas reduced smoking-associated cardiovascular complications. Nonetheless, smoking remains a major concern, and molecular mechanisms by which it causes cardiovascular disease are not known. Peripheral blood monocytes from healthy smokers displayed increased JNK2 and tissue factor (TF) gene expression compared to non-smokers (n=15, p<0.05). Similarly, human aortic endothelial cells exposed to cigarette smoke total particulate matter (CS-TPM) revealed increased TF expression mediated by JNK2 (n=4; p<0.05). Wild-type and JNK2 mice were exposed to cigarette smoke for two weeks after which arterial thrombosis was investigated. Wild-type mice exposed to smoke displayed reduced time to thrombotic arterial occlusion (n=8; p<0.05) and increased tissue factor activity (n=7; p<0.05) as compared to wild-type controls (n=6), while JNK2mice exposed to smoke maintained an unaltered thrombotic potential (n=8; p=NS) and tissue factor activity (n=8) comparable to that of JNK2 and wild-type controls (n=6; p=NS). Smoking caused an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in wild-type but not in JNK2 mice (n=7; p<0.05 for wild-type mice and n=5-6; p=NS for JNK2 mice). In conclusion, the MAP kinase JNK2 mediates cigarette smoke-induced TF activation, arterial thrombosis and ROS production. These results underscore a major role of JNK2 in smoke-mediated thrombus formation and may offer an attractive target to prevent smoke-related thrombosis in those subjects which do not manage quitting.",

        "abstract": "In Alzheimeru0027s disease (AD), cerebral arteries, in contrast to cerebral microvessels, show both cerebral amyloid angiopathy- (CAA) dependent and -independent vessel wall pathology. However, it remains unclear whether CAA-independent vessel wall pathology affects arterial function thereby chronically reducing cerebral perfusion, and if so which mechanisms mediate this effect. To this end, we assessed the ex vivo vascular function of the basilar artery and a similar-sized peripheral artery (femoral artery) in the Swedish-Arctic (SweArc) transgenic AD mouse model at different disease stages. Further, we used quantitative immunohistochemistry to analyze CAA, endothelial morphology, and molecular pathways pertinent to vascular relaxation. We found that endothelium-dependent, but not smooth muscle-dependent vasorelaxation was significantly impaired in basilar and femoral arteries of 15-month-old SweArc mice compared to that of age-matched wildtype (WT) and 6-month-old SweArc mice. This impairment was accompanied by significantly reduced levels of cyclic GMP (cGMP), indicating a reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. However, no age- and genotype-related differences in oxidative stress as measured by lipid peroxidation were observed. Although parenchymal capillaries, arterioles, and arteries showed abundant CAA in the 15-month-old SweArc mice, no CAA or changes in endothelial morphology were detected histologically in the basilar and femoral artery. Thus, our results suggest that in this AD mouse model dysfunction of large intracranial, extracerebral arteries important for brain perfusion is mediated by reduced NO bioavailability rather than by CAA. This finding supports the growing body of evidence highlighting the therapeutic importance of targeting the cerebrovasculature in AD.",

Our previous study has shown that ACC is essential for self-paced decision making. However, it is unclear how ACC neurons represent cost\u2013benefit selections during the decision-making process. In the present study, we trained rats on the same \u201cDo More Get More\u201d (DMGM) task as in our previous work. In each trial, the animals stand upright and perform a sustained nosepoke of their own will to earn a water reward, with the amount of reward positively correlated to the duration of the nosepoke (i.e., longer nosepokes earn larger rewards). We then recorded ACC neuronal activity on well-trained rats while they were performing the DMGM task. Our results show that (1) approximately 3/5 ACC neurons (296/496, 59.7%) exhibited changes in firing frequency that were temporally locked with the main events of the DMGM task; (2) about 1/5 ACC neurons (101/496, 20.4%) or 1/3 of the event-modulated neurons (101/296, 34.1%) showed differential firing rate changes for different cost\u2013benefit selections; and (3) many ACC neurons exhibited linear encoding of the cost\u2013benefit selections in the DMGM task events. These results suggest that ACC neurons are engaged in encoding cost\u2013benefit information, thus represent the selections in self-paced decision making.",

        "abstract": "It has been shown that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and its dopamine system are crucial for decision making that requires physical/emotional effort, but not for all forms of cost-benefit decision making. Previous studies had mostly employed behavioral tasks with two competing cost-reward options that were preset by the experimenters. However, few studies have been conducted using scenarios in which the subjects have full control over the energy/time expenditure required to obtain a proportional reward. Here, we assessed the roles of the ACC and its dopamine system in cost-benefit decision making by utilizing a \"do more get more\" (DMGM) task and a time-reward trade-off (TRTO) task, wherein the animals were able to self-determine how much effort or time to expend at a nosepoke operandum for a proportional reward. Our results showed that (1) ACC inactivation severely impaired DMGM task performance, with a reduction in the rate of correct responses and a decrease in the effort expended, but did not affect the TRTO task; and (2) blocking ACC D2 receptors had no impact on DMGM task performance in the baseline cost-benefit scenario, but it significantly reduced the attempts to invest increased effort for a large reward when the benefit-cost ratio was reduced by half. In contrast, blocking ACC D1 receptors had no effect on DMGM task performance. These findings suggest that the ACC is required for self-paced effort-based but not for time-reward trade-off decision making. Furthermore, ACC dopamine D2 but not D1 receptors are involved in DMGM decision making.",

The objective of this study was to determine whether improved heat tolerance of tall fescue ( Schreb.) by ABA was through the regulation of HSFs and HSPs. ABA-responsive transcriptional factors, ABA-responsive element binding protein 3 (FaAREB3) and dehydration-responsive element binding protein 2A (FaDREB2A) of tall fescue, were able to bind to the -elements in the promoter of tall fescue heat stress transcription factor A2c (Fa). Exogenous ABA (5 \u03bcM) application enhanced heat tolerance of tall fescue, as manifested by increased leaf photochemical efficiency and membrane stability under heat stress (37/32 \u00b0C, day/night). The expression levels of , several tall fescue  (), and ABA-responsive transcriptional factors were up-regulated in plants treated with ABA. Deficiency of Arabidopsis heat stress transcription factor A2 () suppressed ABA-induction of  expression and ABA-improved heat tolerance in Arabidopsis. These results suggested that HSFA2 plays an important role in ABA-mediated plant heat tolerance, and FaAREB3 and FaDREB2A may function as upstream -acting factors and regulate transcriptional activity of  and the downstream , leading to improved heat tolerance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Leaf senescence is a typical symptom of heat damage in cool-season plant species. The objective of this study was to determine whether melatonin could suppress heat-induced leaf senescence in perennial ryegrass ( Lolium perenne  L.) and whether melatonin interacted with abscisic acid (ABA) and cytokinin (CK) to exert its biological function. Perennial ryegrass (cv. \u2018Pinnacle\u2019) plants were foliar sprayed with melatonin or water and exposed to heat stress at 38/33\u00a0\u00b0C (day/night) and non-stress condition at 22/17\u00a0\u00b0C for 28\u00a0d in growth chambers. Exogenous application of melatonin alleviated growth inhibition and leaf senescence induced by heat stress, as manifested by significant higher tiller number, above-ground dry weight, plant height, turf quality, leaf chlorophyll (Chl) content, photochemical efficiency ( Fv / Fm ), net photosynthesis rate, and cell membrane stability in melatonin-treated plants compared to non-melatonin treatment under heat stress. The suppression of heat-induced leaf senescence by melatonin was also reflected by the reduction of transcript levels of senescence-associated genes ( LpSAG12.1  and  Lph36 ) in plants exposed to heat stress. Melatonin treatment increased the endogenous content of melatonin and CK content, whereas it decreased ABA content under heat stress. The expression of CK biosynthesis genes and its signaling response transcription factors (type B  ARRs ) were up-regulated, while the biosynthesis and signaling genes involved in ABA were down-regulated by melatonin treatment under heat stress. These results indicate that the suppression of heat-induced leaf senescence by exogenous melatonin could be associated with activating CK synthesis and signaling while inhibiting ABA synthesis and signaling in perennial ryegrass.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Butanediol (BD) is a bacterial volatile compound which can activate induced-systemic resistance to diseases in plants, but its effects on abiotic stress tolerance are not well-known. The objectives of this study were to examine physiological effects of BD on heat tolerance in creeping bentgrass and to identify BD-responsive metabolites and genes contributing to effects of BD on heat tolerance. Creeping bentgrass plants (cv.\u2019 PennA4\u2019 and\u2019 Penncross\u2019) were treated with 2,3 -butanediol or water through foliar spray and were exposed to heat stress (35/30\u202f\u00b0C, day/night) or optimal temperature (20/15\u202f\u00b0C) in growth chambers. Creeping bentgrass plants treated with BD exhibited improved heat tolerance, demonstrated by higher visual quality and leaf photochemical efficiency when compared with the untreated control plants. Real-time PCR revealed that BD application resulted in up-regulation of genes related to cell elongation, metabolism, and stress responses in plants exposed to heat stress. Metabolite profiling identified a number of organic acids, sugars and sugar acids that accumulated due to BD treatment under heat stress. Results of the current study suggest that BD is effective in improving heat tolerance in creeping bentgrass, mainly through the enhancement of gene expression and metabolite accumulation involved in energy metabolism and stress signaling.",

Gene expression patterns during different stages of plant development can provide clues toward the understanding of its biological functions. The selection and validation of reference genes are the first steps in any real-time quantitative PCR gene expression study. Therefore, suitable reference genes are necessary for obtaining reliable results in real-time quantitative PCR analyses of Kentucky bluegrass. In the present study, 9 candidate reference genes were chosen, and their expression stability in the leaves and roots of Kentucky bluegrass under different stresses (drought, salt, heat, and cold) were evaluated using the GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder programs. The results showed that the expression stability of the candidate reference genes was dependent on the experimental conditions. The combination of SAM with GAPDH was the most stable in leaves under salt stress and cold stress, while TUB combined with ACT or GAPDH was stable in roots under salt or cold stress, respectively. ACT and SAM maintained stable expression in drought-treated leaves, and GAPDH combined with ACT was stable in drought-treated roots. SAM and TUB exhibited stable expression in heat-treated leaves. ACT and RPL were stable in heat-treated roots. In addition, the expression patterns of PpFEH in response to drought and cold stress were used to confirm the reliability of the selected reference genes, indicating that the use of an inappropriate reference gene as the internal control will cause erroneous results. This work is the first study on the expression stability of reference genes in Kentucky bluegrass and will be particularly useful in the selection of stress-tolerance genes and the identification of the molecular mechanisms conferring stress tolerance in this species.",

        "abstract": "Brown patch, caused by Rhizoctonia solani, is a serious disease in Agrostis stolonifera. 2, 3-butanediol (2, 3-BD) is the major component of volatile organic compounds and was found to initiate induced systemic resistance (ISR). To investigate the induced resistance mechanism of 2, 3-BD, we examined the effects of resistance by area affected, along with changes in the content of phytohormones (Zeatin (ZT), Abscisic Acid (ABA) and Indole-3-Acetic Acid (IAA)), the activities of three phenylpropanoid metabolic enzymes (Phenylalaninammo-Nialyase (PAL), Chalcone Isomerase (CHI) and 4-Coumarate:Coenzyme A Ligase (4CL)) and the level of secondary metabolites (total phenols, flavonoid and lignin). The result showed that 2, 3-BD treatment at 250\u202f\u03bcmoL/L had the best induction effect with the area affected decreased from 95% of the control to 55%. Compared to the controls, treatment with 250\u202f\u03bcmoL/L 2, 3-BD induced higher levels of PAL, CHI and 4CL activity and increased total phenols, flavonoid and lignin levels. While 2, 3-BD treatment decreased the content of ZT and ABA but increased the content of IAA compared to controls. This study provides a basis for elucidating the mechanism of 2, 3-BD as a new plant disease control agent.",

This is intended to design the formulation to yield significantly high intraluminal concentrations of the drug than the thermodynamic equilibrium solubility through achieving supersaturation and thus to enhance the intestinal absorption. The major challenges faced by scientists developing supersaturatable formulations include controlling the rate and degree of supersaturation with the application of polymeric precipitation inhibitor and maintenance of post-administration supersaturation. This review is intended to cover publications on this topic since April 2009. Scientific publications associated with characterization of supersaturatable systems and related preclinical and clinical pharmacokinetics (PK) studies are reviewed. Specifically, this review will address issues related to assessing the performance of supersaturatable systems including: (1) Diversified approaches for developing supersaturatable formulations, (2) meaningful in vitro test methods to evaluate supersaturatable formulations, and (3) in vivo PK study cases which have demonstrated direct relevance between the supersaturation state and the exposure observed in animal models and human subjects.",

In vitro characterization of dissolution and supersaturation behaviors of three PEG-8000 based amorphous solid dispersions (ASD) and a physical blend (PB) with crystalline drug were performed in the biomimetic media (e.g., FaSSGF, FaSSIF, FaSSIF-V2). A two-stage dissolution test and a biphasic dissolution-partition test at the small scale (referred as to biphasic test) were employed with intention to examine the in vitro and in vivo relationship (IVIVR) with retrospective PK data in dog model. The two-stage dissolution test revealed a high degree of supersaturation of RTV from these ASDs accompanied by the occurrence of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in the biomimetic media. A rapid decrease of apparent RTV concentrations of these ASDs was associated with significant precipitation upon the pH shift of the dissolution medium, revealing the important role of \"the gastric stage\". In comparison, the biphasic test revealed a lower degree of supersaturation of RTV that is attributed to removal of RTV through partition into octanol, acting as \"the absorption compartment\". These two dissolution tests provide characterization of the supersaturation state with a complex, dynamic interplay among dissolution, precipitation and partition processes. Results of both in vitro dissolution tests are in good agreement with in vivo results in dogs. In addition, three commercial generic RTV drug products were examined by the biphasic test. Agreement was also obtained between the RTV concentrations in octanol at 3\u202fh from these generic drug products and their corresponding relative bioavailability in dogs.",

This attempts to assess the kinetic aspect of IBU partitioning across the water-octanol interface by applying a mechanistic model and to characterize the interfacial resistance. A significant reduction of the Pi across the water-octanol interface was observed with extremely low concentration of the selected excipients in the aqueous media. These results reveal the presence of a surface excess of adsorbed excipients at the water-octanol interface. The retardation of the Pi of IBU was found to be sensitive to (1) the molecular weight and/or the degree of polymerization of these excipients, (2) the hydrodynamic condition of the experimental method, and (3) the pH of the aqueous media. Retardation of the Pi of IBU in the presence of excipients observed in this study is proposed by a steric obstruction mechanism through the adsorbed surface excess layer of excipients located at the water-octanol interface.",

        "abstract": "Abstract  ABT-072 is a candidate drug evaluated for treatment of hepatitis C virus. It is an acidic compound with extremely low intrinsic aqueous solubility. An  in\u00a0vitro  dissolution-partition system, referred as biphasic test method, was used to characterize ABT-072 prototype formulations. This test used 2 aqueous dissolution media of pH 2 and 6.5 in a sequential manner to simulate the transition of drug in gastrointestinal tract. The biphasic test used in this work effectively differentiated various ABT-072 formulations derived from conventional and enabling technologies.  In\u00a0vitro  profiles of these formulations indicate a complex interplay among the 3 competitive kinetic processes including dissolution, precipitation, and partition in the aqueous media. The relative amount of drug partitioned into the organic phase (i.e., octanol) from different formulations was found to be directly related to their  in\u00a0vivo  exposures observed in both dogs and human subjects, respectively. An  in\u00a0vitro - in\u00a0vivo  relationship was obtained between ABT-072 concentrations in octanol at t\u00a0= 2\u00a0h from these formulations and the relative bioavailabilities in dogs and human subjects. This work revealed the significance of polymeric precipitation inhibition by sustaining a supersaturated state of ABT-072 and its impact on  in\u00a0vivo  exposure in human subjects.",

Results showed that Pb bioaccessibility and bioavailability in the apple and kelp groups were significantly lower than other food matrix groups, with corresponding values of 11.05-28.31% and 1.57-8.81%, respectively. Oxidative damage assays showed that digestion products of apple polyphenol extract, which was selected from seven food matrices, could increase the oxidation resistance and the levels of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) by 32.23%, 39.02%, 27.14% and 30.90%, respectively. Additionally, malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels could be decreased by 59.66% and 40.21%, respectively. In conclusion, phenolics were an important food matrix that could decrease the bioavailability and oxidative damage of Pb.",

Results showed that SPHs could alleviate Pb-induced morphological changes of apoptosis and the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential in both cell types. Besides this, SPHs could significantly reduce the activation of caspase-3, -8, -9 induced by Pb, reverse the Pb-induced upregulation of Bax and release of cytochrome C, and downregulate Bcl-2 in cells. HPLC-ICP-MS and SEC-HPLC assays showed that SPHs were low molecular weight peptides (229.4-534.9Da), and the major Se species found in SPHs was SeMet. Taken together, these findings suggested that SPHs could possibly protect the cells against Pb-induced apoptosis via a caspase-dependent mitochondrial pathway, and the primary effective constituents in SPHs were SeMet and Se-containing peptides, suggesting that SPHs might be a novel potential candidate to improve the health of people with Se deficiency or in Pb-contaminated areas.",

Moreover, the selenium-containing peptides of high-activity protein hydrolysates were purified by Sephadex G-25, and identified by reversed phase ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The results showed that 25 peptide sequences containing selenomethionine (SeMet) information above 90% of probability confidence were found in a fraction of alcalase hydrolysates. SeMDPGQQ and TSeMMM of 100% probability confidence were speculated as two novel selenium-containing peptide sequences. The artificially synthesized peptide TSeMMM was subsequently verified by an excellent immunomodulatory activity at a concentration of 80\u202f\u03bcg/mL. In conclusion, the immunomodulatory activity of SPHs was correlated to SeMet sequence in the structure of selenium-containing peptides, and TSeMMM with a stronger immunomodulatory activity demonstrated potential as functional food additives for improving human health.",

Sensory evaluation, electronic nose, gas chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry and scanning electron microscope were combined to investigate the changes of aroma compounds and microstructure during roasting process. Eleven categories of volatile compounds were detected, and the roasting process made an increase in the content of heterocycle compounds and a decrease in the types and content of hydrocarbons and benzene derivatives. Furans and pyrazines made a great contribution to the aroma quality. Furfural, 5-methyl furfural, 2,5-dimethylpyrazine, 2-methylpyrazine, 2-ethyl-6-methylpyrazine and 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazine were the main flavor compounds in the roasted brown rice. The microstructure change of brown rice during roasting was found to have a major impact on the volatilization of aroma compounds.",

        "abstract": "Protein hydrolysates, as surfactants, can scavenge radicals, but their poor distributions at the oil-water interface limit their storage stability. Therefore, we studied covalent interaction between rice protein hydrolysates and chlorogenic acid under alkaline conditions to improve the physical and oxidative stability of oil-in-water emulsions. Turbidity and particle size measurements demonstrated the formation of hydrolysates-chlorogenic acid complexes, and their covalent interaction resulted in the decrease and redshift of the fluorescence intensity. The emulsifying activity of the hydrolysates could be effectively improved after the covalent interaction with 0.025% chlorogenic acid. The modified emulsions possessed a notable physical stability according to the least changes in size (0.08 \u03bcm) and \u03b6-potential (3.34 mV) of the emulsion (P > 0.05). Moreover, the covalent interaction endowed modified emulsions with high oxidative stability to effectively inhibit lipid oxidative deterioration during storage. The adsorption of hydrolysates to the emulsion interface was increased by the adequate addition of chlorogenic acid, resulting in the oil droplet being surrounded by a thicker interfacial film. The covalent interaction between the protein hydrolysates and chlorogenic acid could be used to construct natural emulsion systems with a higher physical and oxidative stability during storage.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Incremental sheet forming (ISF) has gained much attention in the low volume production and rapid prototyping fields due to its inherent flexibility, low-overhead cost, and die-less nature. However, the geometric inaccuracy of the final achievable parts hinders this process from becoming commercially viable. One of the major sources of geometric inaccuracy is springback, which predominately occurs when the formed sheet metal is unloaded by the forming tools and released from the clamps. This paper focuses on the latter case. A practical annealing method that does not rely on complicated setups and geometry-specific compensation algorithms is proposed to reduce the springback that occurs after the unclamping process. Two clamping devices were developed, which have been demonstrated to significantly reduce the amount of springback. The capability of reducing springback by the proposed method and its potential of integrating it with other geometric accuracy improvement methods will enhance the ISF process towards future industrial applications.",

It is hypothesized in this work that maintained contact between tools and the sheet can improve the distribution of sheet thickness and hence, improve material formability and prevent premature fracture. Simulation and experimental studies reveal that thickness prediction models solely dependent on the local wall angle are inadequate for general part geometries. A \u2018Shamrock\u2019 geometry is proposed leading to the development of a novel improved thickness correction model that incorporates wall angle, in-plane curvature, and tool direction.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Water Jet Incremental Micro-Forming (WJIMF) is a novel alternative to Single-Point Incremental Micro-Forming (SPIMF). Instead of using a rigid tool to form the sheet metal, a high-speed and high-pressure water jet is employed to induce plastic deformation. Dieless WJIMF has the capability to form a variety of shapes, but the total depth of the formed shape, which is affected by several process parameters, cannot be well controlled. To alleviate this problem, supporting dies can be used. This paper systematically studies the WJIMF process with several types of micro-machined supporting dies to produce micro-scale shell parts with designed geometries. It has been shown that the design of the toolpath has a profound impact on the final geometry of the part even with the same supporting die. The experimental results suggest that supporting dies with different geometries require unique toolpath strategies to achieve high geometric accuracy. Furthermore, it has been determined that water jet pressure plays an important role in the plastic deformation of the metal foil and that inappropriate combinations of toolpath and water jet pressure lead to buckling which is not found in macro-scale Water Jet Incremental Forming (WJIF). A numerical model in ABAQUS was developed to simulate the process and predict part geometry.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The rapid urbanization in China over the last decade has resulted in increased carbon emissions from the building materials industry. This paper seeks to reach a trade-off between economic benefits and carbon emissions in the building materials industry by integrating a carbon emissions quota allocation (CEQA) based equilibrium strategy under a carbon emissions trading (CET) mechanism that fully considers the stakeholder relationships between the regional authority and the building materials suppliers. An interactive solution approach with fuzzy random variables (FRVs) is designed to determine the trade-off between these decision makers. The methodology is then applied to a real world case to demonstrate its practicality and efficiency. Comprehensive discussions under different policy control scenarios and comparative analysis of two carbon reduction policies are conducted to assist policy makers. It was found that the proposed methodology encouraged building materials suppliers to adjust their production and carbon emissions quota purchase plans, further assisting regional authority to control the industryu0027s emissions performance by providing a \u201cwin-win\u201d solution for the regional authority and suppliers when making logical economic-environmental trade-off decisions.",

        "abstract": "As the problem of increasingly resources consumption and waste generation, more and more people have realized the importance of machinery recycling, which is considered as a method to save resources, total costs and protect environment. On the concerns of recycling and optimizing machinery disposal process, we proposed a machinery recycle system based on reverse logistics, established a mixed integer mathematical model to achieve the goal, in which LINGO software is used to find optimal solutions. Used products contractor, as the decision maker, aims to minimize the total costs so that economic benefits can be obtained and a valid system can be presented. A real-life case study in Leshan City, Sichuan Province, China is introduced using the established model and arithmetic, successfully calculating results, achieving the goal. Moreover, a transportation ratio and collection ratio impacts are given to analyze the influence factors of the model, giving some suggestions are given to the decision makers. Comprehensive conclusions are depicted in the end. In this paper, the established MRS can validly solve the machinery recycle problem, which brings much values to the problems of mechanical industry. Further, through the analysis about the parameters, the total costs can be controlled flexibly.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the consensus for heterogeneous multi-agent systems. The systems are composed of second-order linear and nonlinear agents with different nonlinear terms, which makes systems more general. A valid control law for each agent is given based on the communication with their neighbors. By employing LaSalleu0027s invariance principle and Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient condition is established to achieve the consensus under the undirected connected topologies. Finally, we give a simulation example to illustrate the validity of the theoretical method.",

        "abstract": "Along with the advent of supramolecular chemistry, research on fullerene receptors based on noncovalent bonding interactions has attracted a lot of attention. Here, we present the design and synthesis of a cationic molecular cage - a cyclophane composed of two tetraphenylporphyrins, bridged face-to-face by four viologen units in a rhomboid prismatic manner. The large cavity inside the cage, as well as the favorable donor-acceptor interactions between the porphyrin panels and the fullerene guests, enables the cage to be an excellent fullerene receptor. The 1:1 host-guest complexes formed between the cage and both C60 and C70 were characterized in the solution by HRMS and NMR, UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopies, and confirmed in solid-state by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. The results from solution studies reveal that the cage has a much stronger binding for C70 than for C60, resulting in a selective extraction of C70 from a C60-enriched fullerene mixture (C60/C70=10/1), demonstrating the potential of the cage as an attractive receptor for fullerene separation.",

Herein, we report the design and characterization of a box-in-box assembly on the basis of host-guest radical-pairing interactions between two rigid diradical dicationic cyclophanes. One striking feature of the box-in-box complex is its ability to host various 1,4-disubstituted benzene derivatives inside as a third component in the cavity of the smaller of the two diradical dicationic cyclophanes to produce hierarchical Russian doll like assemblies. These results highlight the utility of matching the dimensions of two different cyclophanes as an efficient approach for developing new hybrid supramolecular assemblies with radical-paired ring-in-ring complexes and smaller neutral guest molecules.",

        "abstract": "Massive MIMO has become a promising key technology for future 5G wireless communications to increase the channel capacity and link reliability. However, with greatly increased number of transmit antennas at the base station (BS) in massive MIMO systems, the pilot overhead for accurate acquisition of channel state information (CSI) will be prohibitively high. To address this issue, we propose a block iterative support detection (block-ISD) based algorithm for channel estimation to reduce the pilot overhead. The proposed block-ISD algorithm fully exploits the block sparsity inherent in the block-sparse equivalent channel impulse response (CIR) generated by considering the spatial correlations of MIMO channels. Furthermore, unlike conventional greedy compressive sensing (CS) algorithms that rely on prior knowledge of the channel sparsity level, block-ISD relaxes this demanding requirement and is thus more practically appealing. Simulation results demonstrate that block-ISD yields better normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance than classical CS algorithms, and achieve a reduction of 87.5% pilot overhead than conventional channel estimation techniques.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:  To investigate the dose\u2013response relationship of green tea polyphenol in an animal model of lung cancer.   Methods:  The effects of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on the inhibition of xenograft tumor growth, the accumulation of 8-hydroxy-2u0027-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and apoptosis based on 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay were evaluated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, namely, H1155, H661, and A427 (a human lung carcinoma-derived cell line). The dose-dependent effects of EGCG on H1155 xenograft tumor growth, as well as the levels of EGCG in plasma and tissue, were also determined in male nude mice.   Results:  EGCG inhibited the growth of NSCLC-derived cell lines (H1155) over a 45-day period. There was a significant reduction (57 %) in tumor weight in EGCG-fed (0.5 %) animals compared with the control group (p u003c 0.05). Linear regression analysis revealed a dose-dependent reduction in tumor size. MTT assay results revealed inhibition of H1155 cell growth (25 %, p u003c 0.05) after 24 h treatment with EGCG. The addition of superoxide dismutase (5 U/mL) and catalase (30 U/mL) reduced the inhibitory effect of EGCG. Mice administered 30 mg/kg EGCG via intraperitoneal injection exhibited the least amount of oxidative stress.   Conclusion:  The results demonstrate the concentration-dependent inhibitory effects of EGCG on lung cancer cells, including H1155 cells, both  in vitro  and  in vivo . The induction of reactive oxygen species, oxidative DNA damage, and apoptosis were evident following EGCG treatment.

The simulate theory of spatially varying ground motions was proposed to consider the influence of seawater layer and soil saturation of seafloor soil layer. Compared with different site conditions, four unique locate sites with the same spatial distance were chose, and two cases of with seawater and without seawater were studied. The comparison results show that the seafloor vertical in-plane motions are noticeable attenuation under seawater layer. The saturation soft soil layer has more influence on seafloor vertical in-plane motions than seawater. Due to considering the complex submarine topography, the synthesized seafloor ground motions can be applied on numerical simulation in most seafloor seismic hazard analyses.",

For the complexity of seafloor condition and the stochastic characteristics of earthquakes, it is necessary to research the seismic responses of these sea-crossing bridges located on seawater layer and irregular bottom conditions. In this paper, a theory of the spatial varying ground motions was derived considering the wave propagation in soil and water. The effects of sea water layer, wave passage, coherence, local site and soil saturation on the seismic responses of a cable-stayed bridge were researched. The transfer function was used to calculate the local site effect and soil saturation effect. The seawater layer effect was studied via a simple medal from Crouse and Quilter. Multi-support and tri-direction excitations were utilized with large mass method. The seismic responses of a long span cable-stay bridge in the site conditions with and without seawater were compared. The results present that the seawater layer affects the earthquake response of bridge greatly, and the soil types have different effects on the different component of bridge. The research will help reasonably evaluate the security of sea-crossing bridge under earthquake excitation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The ice-seawater interface has a significant effect on earthquake-induced ground motion. This paper proposed a new method of modeling spatially varying ground motion due to ice-seawater layer. The reflection function was derived to evaluate the effect of ice-seawater layer on earthquake ground motion. Moreover, the coherence function and site transfer function were used to calculate the loss of spatial coherent and the corresponding local effects, respectively. Furthermore, the effects of water saturation on ground motion was considered. Taking the above factors into consideration, the spatial variance of seismic ground motions in an area with an ice-seawater interface was synthesized. The ground motion was assumed to consist of SH and P-SV waves, which included horizontal out-of-plane SH wave, horizontal in-plane P-SV waves and vertical in-plane P-SV waves. By comparing simulated ground motions with different site conditions, we observed that the vertical in-plane motion at the seafloor was noticeably attenuated when an ice-seawater interface was present. At the same time, the soil layer greatly amplified the acceleration of out-of-plane and in-plane ground motions. In order to verify the ability of the above method for synthesizing seismic time history, a three-dimensional seismic analysis of a large span cable-stayed bridge was conducted. Three of such case studies were used to investigate the effect of the ice-seawater interface on the bridge. Analysis of the displacement and bending moment of the bridge deck and tower demonstrated that the ice-seawater interface had a great effect on the seismic response of the cable-stayed bridge. In particular, the maximum vertical deck displacement with the ice-seawater interface present was 74% of the case in which the interface was absent. Likewise, the maximum longitudinal displacement of the bridge tower with the interface present was 70% of the case in which the interface was absent.",
