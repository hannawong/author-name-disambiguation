        "abstract": "In this work, the effective degradation of Acid Red B dyes in aqueous solution was realized in various ultrasound (US)/TiO2/oxidant (KIO4, KIO3 and K2S2O8) systems. In addition, the degradation efficiencies of Acid Red B in US/TiO 2/oxidant systems for a variety of oxidants were compared. The results revealed the obvious synergistic effects of sonocatalytic technology (ultrasonic irradiation combined with TiO2) and oxidants (KIO 4, KIO3, and K2S2O8). Simultaneously, the effects of some operational parameters such as oxidant kind, ultrasonic irradiation time, solution acidity, oxidant concentration, and system temperature on the sonocatalytic degradation of Acid Red B have also been examined in this article. Under the same conditions, the degradation efficiency of Acid Red B dye was found to retain the order of US/TiO2/KIO 4 > US/TiO2/K2S2O8 > US/TiO2/KIO3 > US/TiO2 > US. Particularly, by using US/TiO2/KIO4 system this method can remarkably shorten the degradation reaction time and completely degraded the Acid Red B. The method of sonocatalytic degradation assisted with oxidants exhibits a widely applied foreground, therefore, should be a feasible choice for treating various organic wastewaters, especially, non- or low-transparent dye wastewaters. \u00a9 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE).",

In addition, the photocatalytic activity of heat-treated nanometer Ti O 2 powder was tested out through the degradation of Rhodamine B dye in aqueous solution under solarlight irradiation. The results reveal that the nanometer anatase Ti O 2 powder heat-treated at 500\u00b0C for 80 min exhibites the highest photocatalytic activity.

        "abstract": "By research, it was found that the Amsacrine (AMSA) can interact with bovine serum albumin (BSA). In this work, the AMSA was adopted as a sonosensitizer and the Metronidazole (MET) was used as a sensitizer to further damage BSA molecules under ultrasonic irradiation. It could be concluded that the damage degree of BSA molecules in the presence of AMSA and MET was more serious than in the presence of pure AMSA. That is, MET could aggravate the damage to BSA molecules under ultrasonic irradiation combined with AMSA. Meanwhile, the damage degree of BSA molecules was also influenced by some factors, such as ultrasonic irradiation time, MET concentration and solution acidity. In addition, the damage site of BSA molecules was estimated by synchronous fluorescence spectra. It was found that the tyrosine (Tyr) and tryptophan (Typ) residues were damaged almost averagely. Perhaps, these research results are of great significance for driving sonodynamic method to treat tumor in clinic application.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the interaction of neutral red (NR) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and the sonodynamic damage to BSA under ultrasonic irradiation was studied by means of ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and fluorescence spectra. The quenching constant (KSV=5.749\u00d7104 L/mol), binding constant (KA=3.19\u00d7104 L/mol) and binding site number (n=0.9462) were measured. The binding distance (r=2.47 nm) between NR and BSA was obtained according to F\u00f6ster's non-radiative energy transfer theory. The damage process of BSA molecules was detected by the hyperchromic effect of UV-vis spectra and quenching of intrinsic fluorescence spectra. In addition, the influencing factors such as ultrasonic irradiation time and NR concentration on the damage to BSA molecules were also considered. The results showed that the damage degree is enhanced with the increase of ultrasonic irradiation time and NR concentration. The possible mechanism of sonodynamic damage to BSA molecules was mainly mediated by singlet oxygen (1O2). Otherwise, the binding and damaging sites to BSA molecules were also estimated by synchronous fluorescence. The results indicated that the NR is more vicinal to tryptophan (Trp) residue than to tyrosine (Tyr) residue and the damage site is also mainly at Trp residues. The research result will bring a certain significance to use sonosensitive drugs in the fields of tumor treatment. Crown Copyright \u00a9 2010.",

        "abstract": "The CeO(2)/TiO(2), SnO(2)/TiO(2) and ZrO(2)/TiO(2) composites were prepared by dispersing various nano-sized oxides (CeO(2), SnO(2), ZrO(2) and TiO(2)) with ultrasound and mixing TiO(2) with CeO(2), SnO(2) and ZrO(2), respectively, in boiling water in a molar ratio of 4:1, followed by calcining temperature 500 degrees C for 60 min. Then a series of sonocatalytic degradation experiments were carried out under ultrasonic irradiation in the presence of CeO(2)/TiO(2), SnO(2)/TiO(2) and ZrO(2)/TiO(2) composites and nano-sized TiO(2) powder. Also, the influences of heat-treatment temperature and heat-treatment time on the sonocatalytic activities of CeO(2)/TiO(2), SnO(2)/TiO(2) and ZrO(2)/TiO(2) composites, and of irradiation time and solution acidity on the sonocatalytic degradation of Acid Red B were investigated by UV-vis spectra. It was found that the sonocatalytic degradation of Acid Red B shows significant variation in rate and ratio that decreases in order: CeO(2)/TiO(2)>SnO(2)/TiO(2)>TiO(2)>ZrO(2)/TiO(2)>SnO(2)>CeO(2)>ZrO(2), and the corresponding ratios of Acid Red B in aqueous solution are 91.32%, 67.41%, 65.26%, 41.67%, 28.34%, 26.75% and 23.33%, respectively. And that the degradation ratio is only 16.67% under onefold ultrasonic irradiation. Because of the good degradation efficiency, this method may be an advisable choice for the treatment of non- or low-transparent wastewaters in the future.",

The products were charactered by powder X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The test of sonocatalytic activities of the composite TiO2/ZnO powders was carried out through the damage of bovine serum albumin (BSA). Otherwise, the effects of several factors on the damage of BSA molecules were evaluated by means of UV-vis and fluorescence spectra. It was found that the damage degree was aggravated with the increase of ultrasonic irradiation time and composite TiO2/ZnO addition amount. These research results were of great significance for driving sonocatalytic method to treat tumor in clinic application.",

However, no significant CFTR function has been demonstrated likely due to low transduction efficiencies of the AAV vectors. To improve AAV transduction efficiency for human airway epithelium (HAE), we generated a chimeric AAV library and performed directed evolution of AAV on an in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelium. Two independent and novel AAV variants were identified that contained capsid components from AAV-1, AAV-6, and/or AAV-9. The transduction efficiencies of the two novel AAV variants for human ciliated airway epithelium were three times higher than that for AAV-6. The novel variants were then used to deliver CFTR to ciliated airway epithelium from CF patients. Here we show that our novel AAV variants, but not the parental, AAV provide sufficient CFTR delivery to correct the chloride ion transport defect to ~25% levels measured in non-CF cells. These results suggest that directed evolution of AAV on relevant in vitro models will enable further improvements in CFTR gene transfer efficiency and the development of an efficacious and safe gene transfer vector for CF lung disease.",

        "abstract": "Dysfunction of CFTR in cystic fibrosis (CF) airway epithelium perturbs the normal regulation of ion transport, leading to a reduced volume of airway surface liquid (ASL), mucus dehydration, decreased mucus transport, and mucus plugging of the airways. CFTR is normally expressed in ciliated epithelial cells of the surface and submucosal gland ductal epithelium and submucosal gland acinar cells. Critical questions for the development of gene transfer strategies for CF airway disease are what airway regions require CFTR function and how many epithelial cells require CFTR expression to restore normal ASL volume regulation and mucus transport to CF airway epithelium? An in vitro model of human CF ciliated surface airway epithelium (CF HAE) was used to test whether a human parainfluenza virus (PIV) vector engineered to express CFTR (PIVCFTR) could deliver sufficient CFTR to CF HAE to restore mucus transport, thus correcting the CF phenotype. PIVCFTR delivered CFTR to >60% of airway surface epithelial cells and expressed CFTR protein in CF HAE approximately 100-fold over endogenous levels in non-CF HAE. This efficiency of CFTR delivery fully corrected the basic bioelectric defects of Cl(-) and Na(+) epithelial ion transport and restored ASL volume regulation and mucus transport to levels approaching those of non-CF HAE. To determine the numbers of CF HAE surface epithelial cells required to express CFTR for restoration of mucus transport to normal levels, different amounts of PIVCFTR were used to express CFTR in 3%-65% of the surface epithelial cells of CF HAE and correlated to increasing ASL volumes and mucus transport rates. These data demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that restoration of normal mucus transport rates in CF HAE was achieved after CFTR delivery to 25% of surface epithelial cells. In vivo experimentation in appropriate models will be required to determine what level of mucus transport will afford clinical benefit to CF patients, but we predict that a future goal for corrective gene transfer to the CF human airways in vivo would attempt to target at least 25% of surface epithelial cells to achieve mucus transport rates comparable to those in non-CF airways.",

        "abstract": "Over the last two decades, enormous effort has been focused on developing virus-based gene delivery vectors to target the respiratory airway epithelium as a potential treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. However, amongst other problems, the efficiency of gene delivery to the differentiated airway epithelial cells of the lung has been too low for clinical benefit. Although not a target for CF therapy, the nasal epithelium exhibits cellular morphology and composition similar to that of the lower airways, thus representing an accessible and relevant tissue target for evaluating novel and improved gene delivery vectors. We previously reported that replication-competent human parainfluenza virus (PIV)-based vectors efficiently deliver the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene to sufficient numbers of cultured CF airway epithelial cells to completely correct the bioelectric function of CF cells to normal levels, resulting in restoration of mucus transport. Here, using an in vitro model of rhesus airway epithelium, we demonstrate that PIV mediates efficient gene transfer in rhesus epithelium as in the human counterpart. Naive rhesus macaques were inoculated intranasally with a PIV vector expressing rhesus macaque \u03b1-fetoprotein (rhAFP), and expression was monitored longitudinally. rhAFP was detected in nasal lavage fluid and in serum samples, indicating that PIV-mediated gene transfer was effective and that rhAFP was secreted into both mucosal and serosal compartments. Although expression was transient, lasting up to 10 days, it paralleled virus replication, suggesting that as PIV was cleared, rhAFP expression was lost. No adverse reactions or signs of discomfort were noted, and only mild, transient elevations of a small number of inflammatory cytokines were measured at the peak of virus replication. In summary, rhAFP proved suitable for monitoring in vivo gene delivery over time, and PIV vectors appear to be promising airway-specific gene transfer vehicles that warrant further development.",

        "abstract": "We have characterized the ability of adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes 1-9 in addition to nineteen novel vectors isolated from various tissues, to transduce mouse and human ciliated airway epithelium (HAE). Vectors expressing alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) and beta-galactosidase were co-instilled into the mouse lung. Of all the vectors tested rh.64R1, AAV5 and AAV6 were the most efficient. The high transduction observed in mouse was reproduced in HAE cell cultures for both rh.64R1 and AAV6 but not for AAV5. Since AAV6 was the most efficient vector in mouse and HAE we also tested the transduction efficiencies of the AAV6 singleton vectors (i.e., AAV6 variants with targeted mutations) in these models. Of these, AAV6.2 transduced mouse airway epithelium and HAE with greater efficiency than all other AAV vectors tested. We demonstrated that AAV6.2 exhibits improved transduction efficiency compared to previously reported AAVs in mouse airways and in culture models of human airway epithelium and that this vector requires further development for preclinical and clinical testing.",

Electron microscopy analysis of the virus particles showed that they have an envelope and surface spikes resembling those of EBOV and a particle size and shape resembling those of HPIV3. When HPIV3/DeltaF-HN/EboGP was inoculated via apical surface of an in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelium, the virus was released from the apical surface; when applied to basolateral surface, the virus infected basolateral cells but did not spread through the tissue. Following intranasal (IN) inoculation of guinea pigs, scattered infected cells were detected in the lungs by immunohistochemistry, but infectious HPIV3/DeltaF-HN/EboGP could not be recovered from the lungs, blood, or other tissues. Despite the attenuation, the virus was highly immunogenic, and a single IN dose completely protected the animals against a highly lethal intraperitoneal challenge of guinea pig-adapted EBOV.",

In the present study, we found AAV6 was more efficient in transducing mouse lower airway epithelia in vitro and in vivo than AAV1. To further explore the mechanism of this difference, we found that significantly more AAV1 bound to mouse airway epithelia than AAV6, yet transduction by AAV6 was far superior. Lectin competition assays demonstrated that both AAV1 and AAV6 similarly utilize \u03b1-2, 3-, and to a lesser extend \u03b1-2, 6- linked sialic acids as the receptors for transduction. Furthermore, the rates of AAV endocytosis could not account for the transduction differences of AAV1 and AAV6. Finally, it was revealed that AAV6 was less susceptible to ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated blocks than AAV1 when transducing mouse airway epithelia. Thus compared with AAV1, AAV6 has a unique ability to escape proteasome-mediated degradation, which is likely responsible for its higher transduction efficiency in mouse airway epithelium.",

        "abstract": "The absence of CFTR activity from the CF airway epithelium results in abnormal regulation of ion transport mechanisms leading to a reduced volume of airway surface liquid (ASL) on the surface of the airway resulting in mucus dehydration and decreased mucociliary clearance, both hallmarks of CF lung disease. In normal airways, endogenous CFTR is expressed predominantly in the ciliated epithelial cells suggesting that delivery of CFTR to CF ciliated cells will be required to restore normal epithelium function. However, delivery of CFTR exclusively to human CF ciliated cells has not yet been achieved to test this hypothesis. We have shown that human recombinant parainfluenza virus (hPIV) efficiently infects human ciliated airway epithelial cells from the lumenal surface. To test whether CFTR expression in ciliated cells could restore normal function to CF epithelia, we generated a hPIV that expressed CFTR (hPIV-CFTR) and tested it in well-differentiated cultures of human CF airway epithelium (CF HAE). Western analyses performed 48 hrs after inoculation of the apical surface of CF HAE with hPIV-CFTR, but not hPIV expressing GFP (hPIV3-GFP) or vehicle control resulted in CFTR expression that was immunolocalized to the apical surface of ciliated cells. To determine whether CFTR expression in CF ciliated cells resulted in chloride ion channel activity, CF HAE inoculated with hPIV-CFTR or hPIV-GFP were assayed in Ussing chambers. Compared to control CF HAE (vehicle or hPIV-GFP treated), inoculation with hPIV-CFTR resulted in a significantly increased forskolin-mediated activation of CFTR chloride channel activity [1.5 0.1 A/cm2 for control (n=18) and 23 2.5 A/cm2 for hPIV-CFTR (n=9)]. To assess the regulation of ASL depth on CF HAE, we measured the rate of absorption of liquid across the apical surfaces of CF HAE 48 hrs after inoculation with vehicle control or hPIV-GFP or hPIV-CFTR. In control CF HAE, the ASL stabilized at 3.1 0.3 m (n=12), a depth associated with decreased mucus transport. However, in CF HAE inoculated with hPIV-CFTR, liquid absorption ceased at a depth of 7.3 0.3 m (n=12), a depth similar to that maintained by normal HAE (7.4 0.6 m, n=7). In addition, the capacity of CF HAE to transport mucus was significantly enhanced after inoculation with hPIV-CFTR. For control CF HAE, rotational velocity of mucus transport was low with little or no mucus transport (1 1 m/sec, n=5) compared to significant mucus transport in CF HAE inoculated with hPIV-CFTR (21 2 m/sec, n=5). Therefore, we have demonstrated that expression of CFTR in ciliated cells of CF HAE results in restoration of the ability of the epithelial cells to regulate the depth of the ASL on the epithelial surface to levels that are sufficient to enable effective mucociliary transport. Since hPIV-CFTR is the most efficient vector we have yet tested for CFTR gene transfer and results in correction of pathophysiological consequences of the CFTR defect in ciliated cells, efforts will be directed at generating hPIV vectors that can be safely delivered to the human airway in vivo.",

        "abstract": "We constructed a human recombinant parainfluenza virus type 3 (rPIV3) that expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) and used this virus, rgPIV3, to characterize PIV3 infection of an established in vitro model of human pseudostratified mucociliary airway epithelium (HAE). The apical surface of HAE was highly susceptible to rgPIV3 infection, whereas only occasional cells were infected when virus was applied to the basolateral surface. Infection involved exclusively ciliated epithelial cells. There was little evidence of virus-mediated cytopathology and no spread of the virus beyond the ciliated cell types. Infection of ciliated cells by rgPIV3 was sensitive to a neuraminidase specific for alpha2-6-linked sialic acid residues, but not to a neuraminidase that cleaves alpha2-3- and alpha2-8-linked sialic acid residues. This provided evidence that rgPIV3 utilizes alpha2-6-linked sialic acid residues for initiating infection, a specificity also described for human influenza viruses. The PIV3 fusion (F) glycoprotein was trafficked exclusively to the apical surface of ciliated cells, which also was the site of release of progeny virus. F glycoprotein localized predominately to the membranes of the cilial shafts, suggesting that progeny viruses may bud from cilia per se. The polarized trafficking of F glycoprotein to the apical surface also likely restricts its interaction with neighboring cells and could account for the observed lack of cell-cell fusion. HAE derived from cystic fibrosis patients was not more susceptible to rgPIV3 infection but did exhibit limited spread of virus due to impaired movement of lumenal secretions due to compromised function of the cilia.",

The expressions of MIF and VEGF were closely correlated with tumor differentiation,clinical staging and metabasis,but were uncorrelated with the pathological type. There was no difference between the positive expression of MIF and VEGF in distant place metastasis and in primary carcinoma within the ovary. There was a positive correlation between the positive rates of VEGF and the positive rates of MIF.Conclusion:MIF and VEGF play an significant role in carcinogenesis,growth of ovarian cancer and development of ovarian cancer.

The results showed that the interface shear stress in the end of short fiber and the tensile stress in the middle of short fiber were both highest, a part of tensile stress in short fiber was transfered by the end of short fiber. The higher the volume fraction of short fiber, the more serious shear stress concentration in the end of short fiber; the bigger the L/D of short fiber the higher the tensile stress of short fiber, but the trend of increasing reduced gradually. With the increase of the modulus of matrix, the interface shear stress concentration and the tensile stress concentration of fiber both decreased, but their absolute values still increased.",

        "abstract": "Novel silica/poly(dopamine)/silver (from inner to outer) (denoted as SiO2/PDA/Ag) conductive micro-particles were first synthesized by biomimetic poly(dopamine) coating. These micro-particles were then coated with a poly(dopamine) layer to form core/shell-structured particles, with silica/poly(dopamine)/silver core and poly(dopamine) shell (denoted as SiO 2/PDA/Ag/PDA). This multilayer core/shell micro-particles were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscope. Polymer composites were then prepared by mechanical blending of poly(dimethyl siloxane) and the core/shell-structured particles. It was found that the silver layer and the poly(dopamine) shell had good adhesion with substrate and they kept intact even under violent shearing stress during mechanical mixing. The effect of the thickness of outermost poly(dopamine) shell as well as the loading amount of this filler on the dielectric and electrical properties of the composites was further studied. The results showed that the dielectric constant, dielectric loss, and conductivity of the composites decreased with increasing shell thickness (10-53 nm) at the same loading level. And the maximal dielectric constant of composites was achieved in the composites filled with SiO 2/PDA/Ag/PDA (with 10-15 nm PDA shell) particles, which was much larger than that of the composite filled with SiO2/PDA/Ag particles without insulative PDA shell. At the same time, the composites can change from conductor into insulator by controlling the shell thickness of core/shell-structured conductive particles. This simple and controllable biomimetic method may be applied to construct many other conductive filler in order to realize controllable dielectric and electrical performance of polymer composites. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "The dispersion of solid nanoparticles within polymeric materials is widely used to enhance their performance. Many scientific and technological aspects of the resulting polymer nanocomposites have been studied, but the role of the structural and chemical heterogeneity of the nanoparticles has just started to be appreciated. For example, simulations of polymer films on planar heterogeneous surfaces revealed unexpected, non-monotonic activation energy to diffusion on varying the surface composition. Motivated by these intriguing results, here we simulate via molecular dynamics a different, fully three-dimensional system, in which the heterogeneous nanoparticles are incorporated in a polymer melt. The nanoparticles are roughly spherical assemblies of strongly and weakly attractive sites, in fractions of f and 1 - f, respectively. We show that the polymer diffusion is still characterized by a non-monotonic dependence of the activation energy on f. The comparison with the case of homogeneous nanoparticles clarifies that the effect of the heterogeneity increases on approaching the polymer glass transition.",

The structure and properties of above composites were carefully investigated. It was found that most AT separated into dispersed units with diameters less than 100 nm in SBR by the direct blend process. However, a few dispersion units as large as 0.2\u20130.5 \u00b5m and a clear network structure of dispersion units in SBR was observed by TEM, SEM and RPA. AT can be purified, but purified AT cannot be easily dispersed in the rubber matrix by polymer melt blending. Siliane coupling agent Si69 can improve the dispersion of AT and enhance the chemical interfacial adhesion. At the same loading, AT (pretreated with Si69) was found to have better reinforcing effect on SBR than carbon black SRF with particle size 60\u2013100 nm and even than N330 with particle size 26\u201330 nm to some extent. Meanwhile, the cost of AT/SBR composites is pretty low.",

In this paper, microcellular rubber foams unfilled (MF), strengthened by pretreated short fibers (MFPS) and untreated short fibers (MFUS) are prepared, respectively. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the three composites have been studied via scanning electron microscope (SEM) and mechanical testing, respectively. The SEM results show that both pretreated and untreated short fibers disperse uniformly in the composites and in bidimensional orientation. Moreover, the pretreated short fibers have much better adhesion with the rubber matrix than untreated ones. The experimental results also indicate that the introduction of short fibers is mainly responsible for the great enhancement of most mechanical properties of the microcellular rubber foams, and the good interfacial adhesion of the short fibers with the matrix contributes to the more extensive improvement in the mechanical properties. It is also found that the reinforcement effect of short fibers to compressive modulus strongly depends on the density of microcellular rubber foams, the orientation of short fiber and the deformation ratio. The compressive modulus of microcellular rubber foams at the normalized density less than 0.70 and beyond 0.70 is predicted by the modified Simple Blending Model and the Halpin\u2013Kerner Model, respectively. The theoretically predicted values are in good accordance with the experimental results.",

The effects of graphite loading and drying method on the dispersion of graphite and the resultant properties of the composites such as electrical and thermal conductivity, friction, and dynamic mechanical properties were studied. The results from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction showed that the composites prepared by fast spray drying exhibited a higher degree of exfoliation and a better dispersion of graphite sheets in the PVP matrix than the corresponding composites prepared by direct drying, leading to a conclusion that fast spray drying can effectively prevent from re-stacking of the exfoliated graphite sheets as illustrated. As a result, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis showed significant increases in the storage modulus and glass transition temperature for the composites prepared by spray drying. Besides, the spray drying as well greatly improved the electrical and thermal conductivity of the composites. It was also found that the electrical and thermal conductivity of the composites strongly depended on the graphite dispersion, while the friction coefficient unexpectedly does not. Increasing graphite loading level might enhance the probability of graphite sheets re-stacking, resulting in poor graphite dispersion. \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to improve the toughness of recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)/ glass fiber (GF) blends through the addition of ethylene- butyl acrylate-glycidyl methacrylate copolymer (EBAGMA) and maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene-octene (POE- g-MAH) individually. The morphology and mechanical properties of the ternary blend were also examined in this study. EBAGMA was more effective in toughening recycled PET/GF blends than POE-g -MAH; this resulted from its better compatibility with PET and stronger fiber/matrix bonding, as indicated by scanning electron microscopy images. The PET/GF/EBAGMA ternary blend had improved impact strength and well-balanced mechanical properties at a loading of 8 wt % EBAGMA. The addition of POE-g-MAH weakened the fiber/matrix bonding due to more POE-g-MAH coated on the GF, which led to weakened impact strength, tensile strength, and flexural modulus. According to dynamic rheometer testing, the use of both EBAGMA and POE-g-MAH remarkably increased the melt storage modulus and dynamic viscosity. Differential scanning calorimetry anal- ysis showed that the addition of EBAGMA lowered the crystallization rate of the PET/GF blend, whereas POE-g- MAH increased it. 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "abstract": "Although carbon nanotubes have been extensively studied since 1991, it is not clear the relations between the tubes' length and their composites' functional and mechanical performance. We in this study employed ball milling to reduce the length of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) from a few microns to hundreds of nm through milling for different time slots. The milled tubes demonstrated a 12.0% increase in surface area. When dispersed in an elastomer matrix, MWNTs showed two types of morphology: separately dispersed and clustered. The cluster size reduced with the ball-milling time. The ball milling obviously increased the composite fracture strain, while mild increase in tensile strength was observed. When MWNT/elastomer composites were compared with carbon black (CB) composites, both showed similar strength, but the former demonstrated markedly higher strength at low strain - a highly desired property for elastomers. The MWNT composites show a strong filler-filler interaction with an unobvious Payne effect. Although the ball milling slightly reduced the electrical and thermal conductivity of the MWCNT composites, they demonstrated much higher conductivity than the CB composites. The ball-milling reduced up to 18.2% of the composite internal heat rise. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Then bis(triethoxysilylpropyl)tetrasulfide (named Si69) was incorporated into above KH550-modified nanocompounds by mechanical blending. The structure and properties of the nanocomposites were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), dynamic mechanical thermal analyzer (DMTA) and mechanical testing. The results showed that a chemical bridge between organically modified clay and rubber matrix through Si69 was built during vulcanization, and the interfacial strength of the cured nanocomposites was remarkably improved. Thus a high performance styrene\u2013butadiene rubber/clay nanocomposite was gained by such a two-step method, which illustrated eight times higher modulus at 300% strain and seven times higher tensile strength compared with cured pure rubber.",

The results showed that there is great difference in reinforcing effects of ZDMA for different elastomers. Strain\u2013stress curves revealed that the tensile-induced crystallization of chains might be the main reason for high strength of ZDMA/rubber composites at room temperature. The saturation and regularity of rubber chains are two essential features to determine the mechanical properties of the composites at room temperature. The kind of ZDMA makes considerable impact on performances of ZDMA/rubber composites, except for ZDMA/hydrogenated nitrile-butadiene rubber (HNBR) composite. The high temperature strengths of ZDMA/rubber composites are not high and are dominated by the polarity and saturation of matrix. Basing on the previous researching, a possible model for microstructure of ZDMA/rubber composites was put forward, which could well interpret the observed phenomenon.",

Meanwhile, the effects of the graphite dispersion state, volume fraction, load and sliding velocity on the friction and wear properties were also explored. As expected, nanocomposite showed better tensile properties, hardness, dynamic storage modulus and lower hysteresis loss peak. The coefficient of friction (COF) for both composites decreased as the load and sliding velocity increased, while the effect of the graphite volume fraction was subtle. The wear rate of nanocomposites decreased as the load and sliding velocity increased. As the load increased, the wear rate of micro-composites increased, but with increasing sliding velocity, the wear rate first increased, reached a maximum, and then decreased. The wear mechanism could be described as graphite sheets de-bonded from matrix, lubricant film formation and breaking, matrix wear, and lubricant film re-formation in cycles. Compared with micro dispersion, the nano-sized dispersion of graphite was beneficial to the formation of a continuous, uniform, and stable lubricant film under high sliding velocity and heavy load, contributing to reduce the COF and improve the wear resistance. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

The clay layers and CB are uniformly dispersed in the SBR matrix at nano-scale. The mechanical properties of the SBR/clay/CB nanocomposites mostly decrease with the increase of clay loading, however, with the increase of clay loading, the change rate of the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites decreases and the aging coefficient of the nanocomposites rises, and the length and depth of the cracks of the aged nanocomposites after bending decrease, which means that the clay layers can provide the nanocomposites excellent thermal aging resistance and heat resistance. The experiment of aging with air and without air proved the importance of oxygen during rubber aging process. The FTIR spectra show the generation of oxygen-containing group on the external surface of the nanocomposites during aging. The DSC results indicate the differences between the internal layer and the external layer of the aged nanocomposites. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Mechanical and dynamic-mechan- ical tests demonstrate that the NBR/graphite nanocomposites possess greatly increased elastic modulus and tensile strength, and desir- ably strong interfaces. The unexpected self-crosslinking of elastomer/graphite nanocomposites was discovered and then verified by oscillating disc rheometry and equilibrium swelling experiments. After critically examining various polymer types by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron spin resonance and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, a radical initiation mechanism was proposed to explain the self-crosslinking reaction. These NBR/graphite nanocomposites possess significantly improved wear resistance and gas bar- rier properties, and superior electrical/thermal conductivity. Such versatile functional properties make NBR nanocomposites a promising new class of advanced materials.",

Modified starch/SBR composite exhibited excellent comprehensive properties relative to those of the corresponding starch/SBR composite without modification. According to Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM), tensile fractured surfaces of various starch/SBR composites demonstrated better interfacial adhesion achieved by the modification. DMTA showed that starch/SBR composites had only one glass transition of SBR and it shifted to the lower temperature compared to that of pure SBR. The glass transition of modified starch/SBR composites shifted to the higher temperature relative to that of the unmodified one due to the improved interfacial adhesion.",

The model was based on two novel algorithms, and was constructed with the same particle spatial distribution structure of the real heterogeneous composite by the introduction of two parameters, i.e. the ratio and the radius of particle-poor region, which both were estimated from SEM micrographs. The model was verified by comparing the predicted and the practical thermal conductivity. It has been found that the simulation results are accurate in the large scale of filler content. The system with non-uniform particle spatial distribution shows higher thermal conductivity than that with random or uniform particle spatial distribution, especially at the high filler volume fraction when conductive pathways or networks form. And at the same filler volume fraction, the thermal conductivity of the composites can be significantly different due to the different particle spatial distributions.",

The emphasis is placed on the discussion whether a \"polymer glassy layer\" in the proximity of the nanosheet exists or not. Results indicate that a \"polymer glassy layer\" actually exists near the nanosheet surface for strongly attractive interfacial interaction. Moreover, the glass transition temperatures at different interfacial interactions are explored, and a gradient of polymer chain dynamics near the nanosheet surface is observed. In short, this work provides a valuable reference for understanding polymer-nanosheet interfacial behavior.

The composite fibers included those of Ag/polybutadiene rubber (BR), Ag/polyisobutylene-isoprene rubber (IIR), and Ag/silicon rubber (SiR). During the study, Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were first generated through reducing the Ag + ions in rubber/N,N-dimethyformamide/tetrahydrofuran solutions upon ultraviolet-irradiation; subsequently, rubber composite fibers with uniform diameters from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers were made by electrospinning the above solutions. The electrospinning was carried out with in-situ chemical crosslinking. The results indicated that chemical crosslinking during (and shortly after) electrospinning was able to improve substantially the morphological stability of rubber fibers. As indicated by the results acquired from UV absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope, Ag nanoparticles with sizes of 10~20 nm were uniformly dispersed in rubber fibers. It was believed that, in addition to the protection of polyvinyl pyrrolidone, a rapid solvent evaporation and limited motion space for a very fine fiber during electrospinning could prevent/mitigate the aggregation of Ag NPs, resulting in a very uniform dispersion. The electrospun Ag NPs/BR composite fibers made of the solution containing very low loading amount (3 wt%) of AgNO 3 demonstrated strong antimicrobial activity. \u00a9 BME-PT.",

The optimum devulcanizing conditions were studied and the sol fraction of the reclaimed rubber obtained was up to 98.5%. The possible devulcanizing mechanism was investigated. Then, the sol component of reclaimed rubber was characterized by gel permeation chromatography, 1H-NMR, and differential scanning calorimetry, and the reclaimed rubber was characterized by TGA. Because of the substitution of a large portion of allylic hydrogen by sulfurated functional groups during vulcanization, the signal of the olefinic proton shift. As a result of the numerous decreases in the active crosslinking sites and the remaining DD, reclaimed rubber could not be cured by sulfur. At last, the blends of virgin butyl rubber and different contents of reclaimed rubber were revulcanized and their mechanical properties investigated. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl.

The complexes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) , X2ray diffraction ( XRD) , and fluorescent spectra , respectively. Different amounts of rare earth complexes were blended with silicon rubber over the melting point of Eu ( TTA) 2 (phen) (MA) . Next , a definite amount of 2 ,52dimethyl22 , 52di (tert2butylperoxy) hexane was added as a cross linker to the composite , to get the uncured composites . Subsequently , the composites were vulcanized at 160 \u2103, and silicon rubber2based composites with different contents of the complexes were prepared and their fluorescent properties were observed . The contents of rare earth complexes were 0196 % , 2 . 83 % , 4 . 63 % and 6 . 36 % (mass fraction) , respectively. Moreover , the composites of Eu ( TTA) 2 (phen) (MA) P SiR were mea2 sured by SEM , XRD , and fluorescent spectra . The measurement result shows that the fluorescent intensity of uncured rub2 ber is similar to one of the pure rare earth complexes . However , there is no marked change of fluorescent intensity in the uncured rubber when the content of rare earth complexes continues to increase .",

        "abstract": "Among all carbon nanostructured materials, helical nanosprings or nanocoils have attracted particular interest as a result of their special mechanical behavior. Here, carbon nanosprings are used to adjust the viscoelasticity and reduce the resulting hysteresis loss (HL) of elastomeric polymer materials. Two types of nanospring-filled elastomer composites are constructed as follows: system I is obtained by directly blending polymer chains with nanosprings; system II is composed of the self-assembly of a tri-block structure such as chain-nanospring-chain. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations show that the incorporation of nanosprings can improve the mechanical strength of the elastomer matrix through nanoreinforcement and considerably decrease the hysteresis loss. This finding is significant for reducing fuel consumption and improving fuel efficiency in the automobile tire industry. Furthermore, it is revealed that the spring constant of nanosprings and the interfacial chemical coupling between chains and nanosprings both play crucial roles in adjusting the viscoelasticity of elastomers. It is inferred that elastomer/carbon nanostructured materials with good flexibility and reversible mechanical response (carbon nanosprings, nanocoils, nanorings, and thin graphene sheets) have both excellent mechanical and low HL properties; this may open a new avenue for fabrication of high performance automobile tires and facilitate the large-scale industrial application of these materials. Carbon nanosprings are found to have the capability to tune the mechanical and viscoelastic properties of elastomeric polymer materials. It is inferred that elastomer/carbon nanostructured materials with good flexibility and reversible mechanical response (i.e., carbon nanosprings, nanocoils, nanorings, and thin graphene sheets) have both excellent mechanical properties and low hysteresis loss.

        "abstract": "The ablative properties of hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber (HNBR) composites filled with fumed silica, organically modified montmorillonite (OMMT), or expanded graphite (EG) were examined. The HNBR/OMMT composite has the lowest linear ablation rate and the highest mass ablation rate and does not tend to be carbonized. On the other hand, the HNBR/EG composite has the highest linear ablation rate and the lowest mass ablation rate, and is prone to carbonization. The ablative properties of the HNBR/silica composite are between those of HNBR/OMMT and HNBR/EG. From the viewpoint of thermal shielding capability, the HNBR/OMMT has the best ablation resistance. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on different HNBR composites indicated that the filler type has no significant effect on the thermal stability of the composites. To understand the ablation mechanisms, the char layers of different HNBR composites after ablation experiments were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy disperse X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). The results showed that the porosity in the char layers of the HNBR/OMMT composite was the highest and the corresponding structure was the loosest of the three composites. The montmorillonite (MMT) dispersed in HNBR experienced phase transition, melting and vaporization when exposed to the flame with the temperature over 2000\u00a0\u00b0C. Fumed silica only melted at such situation. On the other hand, the EG kept their original crystalline structures after the ablation test. Based on these results, the effect of the filler type on the ablation mechanisms of the HNBR composites was discussed.",

In this work we designed various experimental methods with precut samples to characterize the effect of nanodispersed clay on the crack growth resistance.

Low temperature is beneficial to dispersion of Eu(TTA)2(phen) (MA) homogeneously.

        "abstract": "Crosslinked nitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR)/hindered phenol composites were successfully prepared by mixing tetrakis [methylene-3-(3-5-ditert-butyl-4- hydroxy phenyl) propionyloxy] methane (AO-60) into NBR with 35% acrylonitrile mass fraction. The structural and mechanical properties of the NBR/AO-60 composites were systematically investigated by using differential scanning calorimeter, XRD, Fourier transform infrared, scanning electronic microscope, dynamic mechanical analyzer, and tensile testing. The results indicated that the AO-60 changed from crystalline form into amorphous form, and most of the AO-60 molecules could be uniformly dispersed in the NBR matrix. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of NBR/AO-60 composites increased gradually with increasing content of AO-60. The increase in Tg could be attributed to the formation of a strong hydrogen bonding network between the AO-60 molecules and the NBR matrix. Unlike the pure NBR, the NBR/AO-60 rubber composites had only one transition with a high loss factor. With increasing content of AO-60, the loss peak shifted to the high temperature region, the loss factor increased from 1.45 to 1.91, and the area under the tan \u03b4 versus temperature curve (TA) also showed a significant increase. All these results were ascribed to the good compatibility and strong intermolecular interactions between NBR and AO-60. Furthermore, all NBR/AO-60 composites exhibited higher glass transition temperatures and tensile strength than NBR, and they had other desirable mechanical properties. They have excellent prospects in damping material applications. \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Partially aligned polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based nanofibers were electrospun from PAN and PAN/single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in a solution of dimethylformamide (DMF) to make the nanofiber composites. The as-spun nanofibers were then hot-stretched in the oven to enhance its orientation and crystallinity. With the introduction of SWNTs and by the hot-stretched process, the mechanical properties will be enhanced correspondingly. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray scattering (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the tensile test were used to characterize the microstructure and performances of the nanofibers. The orientation and crystallinity of the as-spun and hot-stretched nanofibers confirmed by X-ray have increased. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that the glass transition temperature of PAN increased about 3\u00b0C by an addition of 0.75 wt% SWNTs indicating a strong interfacial interaction between PAN and SWNTs. The tensile strength and the modulus of the nanofibers increased revealing significant load transfer across the nanotube-matrix interface. For PAN nanofibers, the improved fiber alignment, orientation and crystallinity resulted in enhanced mechanical properties, such as the tensile strength and modulus of the nanofibers. It was concluded that the hot-stretched nanofiber and the PAN/SWNTs nanofibers can be used as a potential precursor to produce high-performance nanocomposites. \u00a9 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

We show that the method and sequence of adding reagents greatly affects the luminescence properties of the products. Within the range of synthesis temperatures (30-70\u00b0C), the complex has a better luminescence performance at the lower temperature. However, performance decreased when the temperature decreased to 20\u00b0C. Increase of stirring rate led to better performance in the range 200-700 r.p.m. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) were utilized to characterize the structure and morphology of Eu(Sal)3Phen. The studies demonstrate that the crystallization of the product increased with increasing luminescence of the product. Therefore, it is proposed that increasing the crystallization of the product will enhance its luminescence performance. Copyright \u00a9 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

The modified h-BN fillers were characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and contact angle analysis. The results revealed that a thin PDMS film several nanometers thick was tightly coated on the surface of the h-BN filler after plasma treatment, and this thin film could not be removed by 48 h Soxhlet extraction with n-hexane at 120\u00b0C. Furthermore, the effect of plasma modification on the h-BN filled silicone rubber composites was investigated. The results indicated that the plasma modification improved the interfacial interaction between h-BN and the matrix, but hardly affected the distribution state of the h-BN in the composites. The composites filled with the modified h-BN exhibit significantly higher thermal conductivity than the composites filled with untreated h-BN. \u00a9 2012 Society of Plastics Engineers.",

        "abstract": "Composites of poly(methylvinylsiloxane) (\u201csilicone\u201d) elastomers with polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) were prepared by melt blending. One goal was to establish conditions that would lead to morphologies different from that of a simple filler dispersed in a polymer matrix for the purposes of reinforcement. To this end, the study focused on the dispersion and state of POSS in silicone rubber blends as determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), polarizing optical microscopy (POM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and analysis using a rubber processing analyzer (RPA). Of particular interest were the thermal stability of POSS macromers, and the effects of mixing temperature and subsequent vulcanization of the polysiloxane. The results showed that highly crystalline POSS macromers could undergo condensation reactions at 230 \u00b0C in air, leading to partially amorphous structures. Also, POSS crystals apparently dissolved in the polysiloxane at high temperatures and POSS crystals with hexahedral or flake-like structures recrystallized out upon cooling. Both crystallites and POSS molecules co-existed in these blends, with the amount of dispersed molecular POSS being increased at higher temperatures. The POSS molecules exhibited some physical interactions with the polysiloxane uncross-linked chains, but phase separation was induced by the process of cross-linking. In this curing process, POSS molecules could react with the polysiloxane, resulting in decreases in cross-link density. The original POSS crystals could also be dissolved in the polysiloxane during the initial curing stages, but recrystallization upon cooling gave regenerated crystals that were roughly spherical.",

        "abstract": "Waste rubber has posed challenging environmental and disposal problems across the world. This study focused on the microbial reclaiming of ground tyre rubber (GTR) by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans YT-1 cultured in media with variable Fe2+ concentrations. The Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans YT-1 strain with the ability of oxidizing sulfur and reclaiming waste rubber was isolated and identified. Toxicity tests of different rubber and additives in tyre rubber compounds to microorganisms was quantitatively investigated. After desulfurization, there were many small colonies on the surface of the desulfurizated GTR (DGTR), due to surface degradation by A. ferrooxidans YT-1. The amount of small colonies increased and sulfur content decreased with the increase of Fe2+ concentrations in the media, implying that Fe 2+ concentration had a great influence on the degradation ability of A. ferrooxidans YT-1. A medium with a high Fe2+ concentration was good for growth of A. ferrooxidans YT-1. Compared with styrene butadiene rubber (SBR)/GTR blends, the tensile strength and elongation at the break of the SBR/DGTR blends were significantly improved. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) photographs of the fracture surface further indicated a good coherency between DGTR and the SBR matrix. These results revealed that A. ferrooxidans YT-1 cultured in a medium with a high Fe2+ concentration could improve the reclaiming efficiency of waste rubber. \u00a9 2012 Springer-Verlag and the University of Milan.",

These nanofibers were morphologically stable and were made from electrospun core-sheath nanofibers with the sheath component being polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and the core component being BR, in situ synthesized Ag NPs, and a photo-curing agent of camphorquinone. The method included (1) co-axial electrospinning of core-sheath nanofibers, (2) in situ chemical crosslinking of BR in the core component of nanofibers, and (3) removal of the sheath component of PVP from nanofibers. The experimental observation indicated that, when the flow rate of inner spin dope was slower than that of the outer spin dope, the co-axial electrospinning process would be stable, the resulting nanofibers would not be curled; and there were few conglutination locations among the core-sheath nanofibers. Both electrospun core-sheath nanofibers and the resulting composite nanofibers possessed the cylindrical morphology with smooth surface. The study also revealed that the Ag in the composite nanofibers primarily existed in the elemental form. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "By focusing on the grafted nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in polymer melts, a detailed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation is adopted to investigate the effects of the grafting density, the length of the matrix and grafted chains on the dispersion of the NPs. We have employed visualization snapshots, radial distribution functions (RDFs), the interaction energy between NPs, the number of neighbor NPs, and the conformation of the brush chains to clearly analyze the dispersion state of the grafted NPs. Our simulated results generally indicate that the dispersion of the NPs is controlled by both the excluded volume of the grafted NPs and the interface between the brushes and the matrix. It is found that increasing grafting density or grafted chain length leads to better dispersion, owing to larger excluded volume; however, increasing the length of the matrix chains leads to aggregation of NPs, attributed to both a progressive loss of the interface between the brushes and the matrix and the overlap between brushes of different NPs, intrinsically driven by entropy. Meanwhile, it is found that there exists an optimum grafting density (\u03c3(c)) for the dispersion of the NPs, which roughly obeys the following mathematical relation: \u03c3(c) is proportional to N(m)(K)/N(g)(L), where K, L > 0 and N(m) and N(g) represent the length of the matrix and grafted chain length, respectively. Considering the practical situation that the grafted brushes and the matrix polymer are mostly not chemically identical, we also studied the effect of the compatibility between the brushes and the matrix polymer by taking into account the attraction between the grafted chains and the matrix chains. In general, our comprehensive simulation results are believed to guide the design and preparation of high-performance polymer nanocomposites with good or even tailored dispersion of NPs.",

        "abstract": "Four different reclaiming methods involving important reclaiming factors such as temperature, shear force, and atmosphere were used to reclaim ground tire rubber. The structure and performance of the reclaimed rubber were investigated. The reclaimed samples were all found to be mixtures of three parts: the sol part, a loosely crosslinked gel part, and low molecular substances. For a reclaimed product to have both good processability and mechanical properties, the ideal structure should be that the sol fraction and its molecular weight (Mn) are as high as possible. However, the high sol fraction and high Mn cannot be reached at the same time because of the nonselective scission of the main chain and crosslink bonds. Thus, for a reclaimed rubber to have high quality, the presence of some amount of gel fraction is essential. Our preliminary results showed that the recommended reclaiming method would be a process under oxygen-free atmosphere, without severe shear force, and at relative low temperature.

A dynamic mechanical thermal analyzer was used to obtain the viscoelasticity of the composites. A 3D scanning white-light interfering profilometer was used and the scratch test performed to characterize surface roughness and micro-roughness, respectively, of the composites. WSR of the silica-filled composite was better than that of the carbon black-filled one, and further enhancement of WSR was obtained by replacing silica with nano-diamond. Tan \u03b4 of the composites at 0 \u00b0C, 10 Hz, and tensile strain of 2% did not show good correlation with WSR. The surface roughness of the composites had effects on WSR. The scratch test indicated that the higher the hardness of the filler in the composite, the higher the micro-hardness and the better the WSR. Therefore, the surface micro-hardness of the composites is an important factor affecting WSR, besides viscoelasticity and surface roughness. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Unsaturated metal methacrylate (UMM) as one kind of functional filler has played an important role in reinforcing rubber materials. The in situ self-polymerization of UMM in UMM/rubber composite leads to the uniform dispersion of poly(UMM) in the rubber matrix, while the crosslinking of rubber and grafting between UMM and rubber chains occur simultaneously, making it difficult to clarify the effect of the in situ polymerization on the dispersion of poly(UMM) in the rubber matrix. In this work, we investigated the dispersion mechanism of UMM without rubber matrix for the first time using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Three types of UMMs including zinc methacrylate (Zn(MA)2), sodium methacrylate (Na(MA)) and samarium methacrylate (Sm(MA)3) were chosen to investigate the in situ self-polymerization of UMM. Based on DSC results, we conclude that the crystals with low melting point tend to self-polymerize first and generate a large amount of heat in the presence of peroxide. The high heat of reaction can melt the crystals with high melting point, and more UMM molecules are dissolved in the rubber matrix, thus increasing the extent of the in situ polymerization. Hence, the UMM with low melting point can self-polymerize to a large extent. Our findings provide in-depth understanding of the dispersion mechanism of UMM in rubber. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The PS core possessed a Z -average diameter of 50.3 nm, and the PS\u2013PI particles took a spherical shape with a Z -average size of 50\u201370 nm in diameter.

The oxygen-containing groups attached to the surface of GO generate strong interactions with the XNBR chains through hydrogen bonding (H-bonding), as confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) results. The morphology of the nanocomposites was characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), which show highly exfoliated and uniform dispersion of GO sheets in the matrix. The tensile strength and tear strength of the nanocomposite with 1.9. vol% of GO increased by 357% and 117%, respectively, over those of the matrix. The gas permeability of the nanocomposite is significantly lower than that of the matrix. The high mechanical properties and low gas permeability of the nanocomposite are correlated to the homogeneous dispersion of the GO sheets and strong interfacial interactions, which facilitate the load transfer from XNBR to the GO sheets. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "By employing an idealized model of a polymer network and filler, we have investigated the stress-strain behavior by tuning the filler loading and polymer-filler interaction in a broad range. The simulated results indicate that there actually exists an optimal filler volume fraction (between 23% and 32%) for elastomer reinforcement with attractive polymer-filler interaction. To realize this reinforcement, the rubber-filler interaction should be slightly stronger than the rubber-rubber interaction, while excessive chemical couplings are harmful to mechanical properties. Meanwhile, our simulated results qualitatively reproduce the experimental data of Bokobza. By introducing enough chemical coupling between the rubber and the filler, an upturn in the modulus at large deformation is observed in the Mooney-Rivlin plot, attributed to the limited chain extensibility at large deformation. Particularly, the filler dispersion state in the polymer networks is also characterized in detail. It is the first demonstration via simulation that the reinforcement mechanism stems from the nanoparticle-induced chain alignment and orientation, as well as the limited extensibility of chain bridges formed between neighboring nanoparticles at large deformation. The former is influenced by the filler amount, filler size and filler-rubber interaction, and the latter becomes more obvious by strengthening the physical and chemical interactions between the rubber and the filler. Remarkably, the reason for no obvious reinforcing effect in filled glassy or semi-crystalline matrices is also demonstrated. It is expected that this preliminary study of nanoparticle-induced mechanical reinforcement will provide a solid basis for further insightful investigation of polymer reinforcement.",

        "abstract": "We systematically investigated the structural and dynamic properties of nanofilled elastomer on the basis of the idealized model of elastomer and nanoparticle. The simulated results indicate that the introduced nanoparticles induce more efficient chain packing. Meanwhile, a mobility gradient of polymer chains is found to exist approaching the nanoparticles. For the dynamic properties, we find for the first time that both the time-concentration and time-temperature superposition principles (TCSP and TTSP) are applicable at the chain length scale, while both break down at the segmental length scale for the filled system. However, the TTSP still holds at the segmental length scale for the pure system. Furthermore, the time-temperature-concentration superposition principle (TTCSP) applies well for the terminal relaxation of polymer nanocomposites. This scaling behavior has the underlying implication that the rheological properties (i.e., steady-state shear viscosity) of polymer nanocomposites possess thermorheological simplicity. In addition, interestingly, the characteristic relaxation time as a function of filler concentration exhibits an Arrhenius temperature dependence, if the concentration variation is regarded as an inverse of temperature variation. We suggest the introduced nanoparticles exert the similar effect to the thermodynamic variables (e.g., pressure and temperature) on the polymer dynamics. Lastly the stress relaxation of the model system is also examined. The decay of the bond orientation of polymer chains during the relaxation process is studied by changing the draw ratio, the filler loadings and the affinity between the nanoparticle and polymer. In order to equivalently investigate the stress relxation, we propose a new approach named conformational relaxation. It is observed that the conformational relaxation can be approximately fitted well by an exponential function for the pure and filled systems, similar to the stress relaxation. The TTSP is also applicable for the conformational relaxation of the pure system, while breaks down for that of the filled system. The relaxation time extracted by fitting the conformational relaxation curves with an exponential function at different temperatures, exhibits an Arrhenius relationship with the temperature for the pure and filled systems. Moreover, contrary to the isotropic dynamics during the creep process of the polymer from the simulated results of de Pablo, our simulated result shows an anistropic polymer dynamics with an accelerated relxation in the predeformed direction during the stress relaxation process. \u00a9 2009 American Chemical Society.",

WAXD results reveal that appropriate epoxidation, for example, ENR-25 epoxidized with \u224825% isoprene units, can unexpectedly enhance the SIC of natural rubber (NR), resulting in the improvement of tear resistance. On the other hand, exorbitant epoxidation, for example, ENR-40 epoxidized with \u224840% isoprene units, depresses the SIC and weakens the mechanical properties of NR remarkably. P-IR studies reveal that epoxidation can promote the orientation of chain segments along the stretching direction, which plays a determining role on SIC of NR. Accordingly, hierarchical multiscale schematic models are proposed. This insight into epoxidation on SIC of ENR strongly suggests that ENR with appropriate epoxidation degree is a promising candidate material for the fabrication of high-performance engineering rubber products.",

        "title": "Molecular Dynamics Study on Nanoparticle Diffusion in Polymer Melts: A Test of the Stokes-Einstein Law",
        "abstract": "Molecular dynamics simulations are used to investigate the diffusion process of nanoparticles in polymer melts. The effects of size, concentration, and mass of the particle, chain length, and polymer -particle interaction on the diffusion of particles in polymer melts are also explored. Our simulated results indicate that the gyration radius of the polymer chain is the key factor determining the validity of the Stokes -Eintsein(SE) relation in describing the particle diffusion at infinite dilution. When the particle size is larger than the gyration radius of the polymer chain, the SE formula can predict the particle diffusion in the polymer melts correctly, and the particle diffusion does not show mass dependence. When the particle size is smaller than the gyration radius of the polymer chain, however, the SE equation becomes invalid in the prediction of particle diffusion, because particle diffusion is exactly related to the nanoviscosity rather than the macroviscosity used in the SE formula. Furthermore, it is also found that the diffusion coefficient of the particle is inversely proportional to the cube of its hydrodynamic radius. In this regime where the particle size is smaller than the gyration radius of the polymer, particle diffusion is independent of the chain length or molecular weight of the polymer, but dependent on the particle mass. In addition, we also observe the transition process of the particle experiencing macroviscosity to nanoviscosity of the polymer melts by gradually increasing the chain length. The concentration dependence of the particle diffusion is similar to the results from Heyes et al., and at high volume fractions, the negative deviations from the SE formula are found. By exploring the effect of particle - polymer interaction on the diffusion of the particle larger than the gyration radius of the polymer chain, it is found that the condition where the SE formula becomes valid in the prediction of the particle diffusion is that where different reasonably defined effective hydrodynamic radii must be used.",

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs showed that these nanocomposites possessed a unique structure, in which the rubber molecules \u201cseparated\u201d the clay particles into either individual layers or just silicate layer aggregates of nanometer thickness without the intercalation of rubber molecules into clay galleries, different from intercalated and exfoliated clay nanocomposites. Such a structure resulted from the competition between separation of rubber latex particles and re-aggregation of single silicate layers during the co-coagulating process. The content of bound rubber of SBR\u2013clay nanocompound is more than that of the corresponding rubber filled with micrometer clay or silica because of the increased networking of silicate layers with the nano-meter dispersion and the high aspect ratio. The glass transition temperature of SBR\u2013clay nanocomposites increased as compared with that of the pure SBR. The tensile strength of SBR\u2013clay nanocomposite loading 20 phr clay was 6.0 times higher than that of the conventional SBR\u2013clay composite.

        "title": "Synthesis, characterization and in vitro degradation study of a novel and rapidly degradable elastomer",
        "abstract": "Biodegradable elastomers represent a useful class of biomaterials. In this paper, a novel biodegradable elastomer, poly(PEG-co-CA) (PEC), was synthesized by condensation of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and citric acid (CA) under atmospheric pressure without any catalyst. We first synthesized a pre-polymer by carrying out a controlled condensation reaction between PEG and citric acid, and then post-polymerised and simultaneously cross-linked the pre-polymer in the mould at 120 \u00b0C. The pre-polymer was characterized by FT-IR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, GPC and DSC. A series of polymers were prepared at different post-polymerisation time and different monomer ratios. Measurements on the mechanical properties of PEC testified that the new polymers are elastomers with low hardness and big elongation, and hydrolytic degradation of the polymer films in a buffer of pH 7.4 at 37 \u00b0C showed that PEC had excellent degradability (all the films show the weight losses more than 60% after 96 h incubation). The different post-polymerisation time and monomer ratio had strong influence on the degradation rates and mechanical performances. The material is expected to be useful for controlled drug delivery and other biomedical applications. Keywords Poly(PEG- co -CA) (PEC) Elastomer In vitro degradation Synthesis 1 Introduction Biodegradable polymers have been a focus of research because of various applications in biomaterials area such as scaffolds for regenerating soft tissue in vivo or in vitro [1\u20137] and depot systems for localized drug delivery [8\u201313] . Nowadays much research of biodegradable polymers concentrates on relatively hard materials such as polyglycolide, polylactide, and their copolymers [14\u201319] , whereas comparatively less attention has been paid to biodegradable elastomers [20] . Recently, the work conducted by Wang Yadong and co-workers, synthesis of poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS), a biodegradable thermoset elastomer synthesized by condensation of glycerol and sebacic acid [21,22] , is one of the important starting works in this field. More recently, the development of poly(1,8-octanediol- co -citric acid)(POC), a thermoset polymer synthesized by carrying out a condensation reaction between 1,8-octanediol and citric acid [23] , constitutes an important contribution to the field. Analogous to PGS, POC is a biodegradable elastomer, and also possesses a cross-linked, three-dimensional network of random coils (a characteristic considered to give its elasticity) [21] . As relatively soft biodegradable elastomers, PGS and POC have uses in biomaterials area. However, their long degradation time (more than 60 and 180 days in vivo, respectively) is usually a disadvantage for some medical applications such as drug carrying devices. The purpose of this work was to design and synthesize a rapidly biodegradable elastomer, which possesses a cross-linked, three-dimensional network framework. We conceived as below: citric acid can be used as a polyfunctional monomer that can react with diols to create degradable elastomeric materials. It is also a monomer that can participate in hydrogen bonding interactions within a polyether\u2013ester network. On the other hand, citric acid is a non-toxic metabolic product of the body (Krebs or citric acid cycle), readily available, and inexpensive. Some literatures [24\u201327] reported that polyesters of citric acid had been used as polymeric matrices for controlled and sustained drug release. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is chosen as the difunctional monomer in this paper to enable ester bond formation with citric acid and control the density of elastomer network in a certain degree. Furthermore, PEG presents outstanding biological properties, including hydrophilicity, solubility in water and non-toxicity [28] , and absence of antigenicity and immunogenicity [29] , which allow PEG to be used in many biomedical and biotechnological applications. At the same time, PEG as a good candidate for accelerating degradation of biomaterials by combined polymerizing or blending were reported in large number of papers [30\u201336] . As a thermoset elastomer, the synthesis of poly(PEG-co-CA) (PEC) is simple. Briefly, we first synthesized a pre-polymer by carrying out a condensation reaction between poly(ethylene glycol) and citric acid under atmospheric pressure, and then post-polymerised and cross-linked the pre-polymer in a mould at 120 \u00b0C. A relatively simple synthesis of PEC that can be carried out under mild conditions, especially without adding toxic catalysts or cross-linking reagents makes it a good candidate for biomaterials. The low cost of the monomers for synthesis of PEC should also increase its potential for future commercialisation. In this paper, the effects of the molar ratio of two reactive monomers and post-polymerisation time on the thermal and mechanical properties and as well as in vitro degradation were investigated systematically. As far as we know the report about the synthesis and characterization of PEC, a biodegradable thermoset elastomer, has not been found to the present day. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Poly(ethylene glycol) with a molecular weight of 200 (PEG200, T g is \u221285 \u00b0C) was obtained from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co. and dried under vacuum at 25 \u00b0C overnight before use. Citric acid (Tianjin Chemical Reagent Co.) was used without further purification. 2.2 Preparation of PEC PEG200 and citric acid (molar ratio of PEG/CA = 10:9) were added to a 250 ml three-neck round-bottom flask fitted with an inlet and outlet adapter. The mixture was melted under nitrogen by stirring at 150\u2013155 \u00b0C by means of a silicone oil bath. The mixture was stirred for 7 h at 140 \u00b0C under atmospheric pressure to create the pre-polymers. The pre-polymers, with the weight-average molecular weight ( M w ) about 1200, were post-polymerised at 120 \u00b0C under nitrogen for a period of time ranging from 15 h to 36 h to create PEC with various degrees of cross-linking. Reaction formula is shown in Scheme 1 . On the other hand, we changed the molar ratio of monomer (PEG/CA = 1:1, 10/8, 3/2) with the same post-polymerisation time, and got a series of elastomers. Here \u201cPEC(10/9)24 h\u201d denotes the elastomer synthesized on conditions that molar ratio of PEG200 to citric acid is 10 to 9 and post-polymerisation time is 24 h. Similarly hereinafter. 2.3 Characterization Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet-210 spectrophotometer (USA) using salt plates by hot-casting for the structure information. 1 H NMR spectroscopy and 13 C NMR spectroscopy of pre-polymers were carried out with a Bruker AV600 spectrometery. Dimethyl sulfoxide- d 6 (DMSO- d 6 ) was used as the solvent for the NMR measurements. The average molecular weight of pre-polymer was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements on a Waters Breeze instrument equipped with three Waters columns (Styragel HT3_HT5_HT6E) using tetrahydrofuran as the eluent (1 ml/min) and a Waters 2410 refractive index detector. Polystyrene standards were used for calibration. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms were recorded in the range of \u221280 \u00b0C to 150 \u00b0C on a Perkin Elmer DSC (USA) using a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min under nitrogen. Tensile tests were performed in CMT4104 testing machine equipped with a 50 N load cell at 21 \u00b0C. Briefly, the dog-bone-shaped sample (25 mm \u00d7 2 mm \u00d7 1 mm, length \u00d7 width \u00d7 thickness) was tested at a rate of 50 mm/min to break. The stress\u2013strain curve and Young's modulus were recorded. Four to 6 samples were measured and their values averaged. The cross-link density ( n ) was calculated by Eq. (1) [21] (1) n = E 0 3 R T where n represents the number of chain segments between two cross-linking points per unit volume network; E 0 represents Young's modulus (Pa); R is the universal gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. 2.4 In vitro degradation Disk specimens (10 mm in diameter, approximately 1\u20131.5 mm thickness) were placed in a small bottle containing 20 ml phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4). The bottle was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for certain periods of time. After incubation the film was washed with water and dried at 40 \u00b0C in vacuo. Weight loss was calculated by comparing the initial mass ( W 0 ) with the mass measured at a given time point ( W t ), as shown in Eq. (2) . Three individual experiments were performed for degradation test, and then the average value was gained. (2) Weight loss ( % ) = W 0 \u2212 W t W 0 \u00d7 100 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization Fig. 1 shows FT-IR spectra of PEC(10/9) pre-polymer and PEC(10/9)24 h elastomer. The intense C O stretch at 1737 cm \u22121 confirms the formation of ester bonds. FT-IR also shows a broad, intense OH stretch at 3460 cm \u22121 , indicating that the hydroxyl groups are hydrogen bonded which can contribute to hydrophilicity, biocompatibility and mechanical properties [23] . The bands around 1292, 1250, 1190 and 1111 cm \u22121 were attributed to the C\u2013O stretching vibration and the methylene groups at 2960 cm \u22121 . Furthermore, it can be seen from Fig. 1 that the absorption at 3460 cm \u22121 decreased after post-polymerisation, whereas the absorption at 2960 cm \u22121 remained unchanged. So we considered that the post-polymerisation occurred through the reactions between carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. The 1 H NMR spectrum of PEC pre-polymers ( Fig. 2 ) shows peaks at 4.09 and 4.10 ppm assigned to \u2013COOCH 2 \u2013 methylene protons of pre-polymers. This indicates that the PEG has taken part in the condensation reaction. The peaks around 3.57 ppm are due to \u2013CH 2 \u2013 (k, e, f) of PEG segment. The resonances at 12.45 and 2.78 ppm belong to \u2013COOH (a) and \u2013CH 2 \u2013 (p, q) of CA units, respectively. The 13 C NMR spectrum of PEC(10/9) pre-polymer ( Fig. 3 ) shows five groups of signals. The first consists of four signals at 174.6, 172.9, 171.5 and 169.7 ppm that arise from the carbonyl carbon atoms a, b and d of CA units. The second group has two signals at 73.3 and 72.9 ppm, which correspond to quaternary carbon o. The third group consists of two signals at 70.2 and 68.5 ppm that are attributed to the carbon atoms k, e and f of PEG units. The fourth signals correspond to carbon atoms l and confirm the presence of ester groups. The last group belongs to methylene carbon atoms p and q of CA units. The typical DSC heating thermograms of some PEC elastomers are depicted in Fig. 4 . It can be seen that all of the polymers were amorphous, with glass transition temperatures ( T g ) ranging from \u221217.6 to +2.9 \u00b0C, and no crystal melting peaks were found. Additionally, the glass transition temperature of the polymer decreased as the PEG content of the PEC increased, and instead of decreasing, as would be expected, the T g of polymer increased with prolonged post-polymerisation time. Since the glass transition temperatures of new amorphous polymers are lower than room temperature, all of them can be considered as elastomers. The change of T g of polymer can be explained as the PEG monomer takes part in the condensation reaction and, thus, is incorporated into the final elastomer. As the PEG content of the PEC increased, the glass transition temperature of the elastomer decreased, approaching the T g of PEG200 (which is \u221285 \u00b0C). On the other hand, it can be seen from Table 1 that longer post-polymerisation time leads to higher cross-linking density of elastomer. As cross-linking density increases, the length of molecular chain between cross-linking points will decrease, and thermal motion of polymer chains will be more constrained, which results in the increasing of glass transition temperature. 3.2 Mechanical properties The typical stress\u2013strain curves of the polymer films are depicted in Fig. 5 A, B. Fig. 5 A shows the stress\u2013strain relationships of elastomers prepared using the same PEG:CA ratio of 10:9, but with different post-polymerisation time. The main mechanical properties of the elastomers are also summarized in Table 1 . As shortening post-polymerisation time, the elastomers became softer (Young's modulus, E 0 , decreased), more extensible (ultimate strain, \u025b , increased). We found that as post-polymerisation time was less than 15 h, PEC(10/9) film did not exhibit good elastomeric properties and the tensile recovery of film was not perfect for the additional extension. As the post-polymerisation time changed from 20 h to 36 h, the Yong's modulus and ultimate stress changed from 0.64 and 0.95 MPa to 1.91 and 1.51 MPa. Fig. 5 B demonstrates that it is also possible to manipulate the elastomer mechanical properties by altering the monomer ratio. It can be seen that the stress\u2013strain curves were quite different depending on the polymer composition. The results in Table 2 indicate that as the PEG content of the elatstomer increased, Young's modulus, cross-link density and ultimate stress of PEC decreased. In other words, the elastomer became softer but less elastic as the CA content increased. When PEG:CA is 1:1, polymer film did not exhibit good elastomeric properties and the tensile recovery of film was not perfect for the additional extension. We suppose the reason was that the structure of polymer synthesized at 1:1 monomer ratio mostly existed as linear molecules, and cross-link degree of polymer is lower than the others ( Table 2 ), hence the elongation of PEC(1/1)24 h is up to 900% while the ultimate stress is only 0.59 MPa. In contrast, at 3:2 monomer ratio, branching degree of polymer molecules is higher, leading to higher cross-link density, so the ultimate stress of PEC(3/2)24 h is higher up to 1.26 MPa. It is apparent from the above data, that PEC displayed mechanical properties markedly superior to those exhibited by other biodegradable elastomers developed recently. For example, while PEC(10/9)24 h attained UTS levels above 1.19 MPa and elongation about 445%, poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) exhibited a tensile strength slightly above 0.5 MPa and elongation at break values below 350%, respectively [21,22,37] . 3.3 In vitro degradation of elastomers In vitro degradation of the polymers is investigated by monitoring the change of the weight loss during degradation in phosphate buffer solution. Fig. 6 shows the weight losses of PEC films degraded in the phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) at 37 \u00b0C. All the films show the weight losses more than 60% after 96 h incubation. Weight losses increase very rapidly with time in the first 6 h (up to 15%), and then become correspondingly slower in the later period. From Fig. 6 A, it can be seen that the degradation rate of PEC(3/2)24 h is slower than that of PEC(10/9)24 h. The reason is that the PEC(3/2)24 h has higher cross-linking density ( Table 2 ), which can lead to lower coefficients of diffusion and higher resistance against hydrolysis. Fig. 6 B shows the weight losses of the PEC(10/9) films with different post-polymerisation time. The weight loss increases with decreasing post-polymerisation time, which could be ascribed to the decreased cross-linking density ( Table 1 ). As post-polymerisation time decreases, the network space increases and more hydroxy groups exist in bone of macromolecule, which can facilitate the solution diffusion into the film. These results indicate that it is possible to manipulate the elastomer degradation properties by altering the monomer ratio or changing the post-polymerisation time. Furthermore, all the polymers prepared in this work degrade faster than other biodegradable elastomers recently developed elsewhere. For instance, PGS and POC degraded completely more than 2 and 6 months, respectively, under the same conditions [21,23] . 4 Conclusions Our work aimed at developing a novel biodegradable elastomer with good elasticity and faster degradation ratio, by a condensation reaction between hydrophilic monomers, PEG200 and CA, under mild conditions. The PEC with excellent mechanical properties can be acquired by controlling the cross-linked time and the initial monomer molar ratio. At the same time, the degradation rate of elastomer can be varied over a comparatively wide time range. Additionally, the pre-polymers of PEC have low viscosity, which allows easy part manufacture by injecting the pre-polymers into moulds. Compared to existing biodegradable elastomers in biomaterial, PEC is inexpensive and easy to synthesize and process. The relatively simple synthesis that can be carried out under mild conditions without addition of toxic catalysts or cross-linking reagents and good degradation property make it a good candidate for drug delivery and other biomaterials.

        "abstract": "It is a great challenge to fully understand the microscopic dispersion and aggregation of nanoparticles (NPs) in polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) through experimental techniques. Here, coarse-grained molecular dynamics is adopted to study the dispersion and aggregation mechanisms of spherical NPs in polymer melts. By tuning the polymer-filler interaction in a wide range at both low and high filler loadings, we qualitatively sketch the phase behavior of the PNCs and structural spatial organization of the fillers mediated by the polymers, which emphasize that a homogeneous filler dispersion exists just at the intermediate interfacial interaction, in contrast with traditional viewpoints. The conclusion is in good agreement with the theoretically predicted results from Schweizer et al. Besides, to mimick the experimental coarsening process of NPs in polymer matrixes (ACS Nano 2008, 2, 1305), by grafting polymer chains on the filler surface, we obtain a good filler dispersion with a large interparticle distance. Considering the PNC system without the presence of chemical bonding between the NPs and the grafted polymer chains, the resulting good dispersion state is further used to investigate the effects of the temperature, polymer-filler interaction, and filler size on the filler aggregation process. It is found that the coarsening or aggregation process of the NPs is sensitive to the temperature, and the aggregation extent reaches the minimum in the case of moderate polymer-filler interaction, because in this case a good dispersion is obtained. That is to say, once the filler achieves a good dispersion in a polymer matrix, the properties of the PNCs will be improved significantly, because the coarsening process of the NPs will be delayed and the aging of the PNCs will be slowed.",

This was followed by emission concentration quenching with further increasing the Tb(AA)3Phen content. The TEM observation and XRD analysis revealed that the Tb(AA)3Phen dispersed in the PVP fibers in the state of molecular clusters or tiny particles (d<10 nm).

        "abstract": "The morphologies of various ZDMA-reinforced elastomers (including BR, SBR. EPDM, NBR, EPM, POE and HNBR) were studied by using SEM and TEM. It is shown that there are two essential dispersion structures in the vulcanizates of these systems: nano-scale dispersion structure and micron one. It is thought that nano-scale with strong reinforcing ability is formed by in-situ polymerization during peroxide curing process; while micron one without reinforcement for vulcanizates is the residual ZDMA particle. It is also found that the relative content and size of this two dispersion structures varies from different compound systems. For BR and SBR vulcanizates, there are more micron structures and the dimension of nano structure one is relatively smaller than those of other system. For EPDM, NBR, EPR, POE and HNBR vulcanizates, there is fewer microns structure and the dimension of nanometer one is larger slightly. The effect of size of original ZDMA particles on morphology of vulcanizae was also investigated. In POE system, ZDMA original particles with larger size lead to more micron dispersion structures. in vulcanizate. However, there is no considerable influence of size of ZDMA particles on morphologies of EPDM, EPM, NBR and HNBR systems. The details for the formation of these structures are illustrated. These differences in morphologies directly impact on the mechanical properties of vulcanizates.",

To make a comparison with the above, the dispersed states of clay/rubber nanocomposites were studied and compared with that of clay/PMMA nanocomposite. According to TEM and SEM photos, there are several levels of dispersed structure with different dimension. Mechanical intermix of rubber contributes to the further fragmentation of the dispersed particles. The further fragmentation of the dispersed particles depends on the cohesion and structural feature of the dispersed phase. Especially, just direct mechanical intermix can in some degree induce fragmentation of clay particles to form some nanodimension dispersed particles. There, however, is no way to form ideally uniformly dispersed nanocomposite. In most nanocomposites besides nanocomposites prepared by in-situ polymerization, there are some congeries. The more the loading amount of dispersed phase leads to the more amount of congeries. The definition of the dispersed phase depends on the resolution of the instrument. A new definition of nanocomposite, therefore, was put forward. If in certain resolution, the dimension of dispersed particles which was less than 100nm and these particles have more than 80 percent by weight or by volume of all the dispersed phase, this materials is nanocomposite. From the point of this view, the rubber strengthened by either carbon black or carbon white involved in this paper was nanocomposites.",

A synergistic reinforcement on static and dynamic mechanical properties was revealed. When FS nanofibers and PA-66 microfibers were used together in an appropriate volume ratio, static and dynamic mechanical properties (such as tensile stress, mechanical anisotropy, compression modulus, dynamic storage modulus and tensile fatigue property) of the resulting composites were substantially improved. The co-reinforcement mechanism of nano- and micro-sized fibers was discussed in terms of composite fracture morphology. The synergetic reinforcement effect on the dynamic fatigue properties is attributed to the result of competitive factors including stress transfer, crack initiation and propagation, and matrix reinforcement, whereas the synergetic reinforcement effect on the static tensile properties is achieved due to the strong interfacial adhesion between FS nanofibers and rubber.",

The composition of the NBR surface was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS results showed that PDA was successfully deposited onto the NBR surface. The morphology of the NBR surface was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM images showed that PDA had formed a distinctive layer ready for electroless deposition of silver.

PA6 was partially complexed with CaCl 2 for the purpose of suppressing interchain amide group hydrogen bonding. The fibers were characterized with scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. In the gel spinning process, a mixed tetrachloroethane and chloroform solution was chosen as the coagulation bath after a comparison of different types of solutions. From our investigation of the morphology, structure, and mechanical properties of gel-spun and hot-drawn fibers, it was indicated that the modulus and tensile strength increased with increasing draw ratio, the orientation of the fibers was improved, and the cross section of the PA6 gel fibers became more smooth and tight. The results from the XRD, DSC, and FTIR tests indicated that calcium metal cations complexed with the carbonyl oxygen atoms of PA6.

The dispersion of clay was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). TEM images demonstrate that both exfoliated and intercalated nanoclay layers co-exist in these nanocomposites. XRD patterns reveal that the basal spacing of clay increases from 4.2 nm for swollen organic modified silicates to 6.2 nm for those dispersed in nanocompounds, and the dispersion structure is extremely disordered and close to an exfoliated structure. The experimental results show that the mechanical and gas barrier properties of nanocomposites increased with increasing amount of clay. The properties of nanocomposites prepared by the new method, such as shore A hardness, tensile strength, air-tightness and so on, were superior to those of nanocomposites by the solution intercalation and the traditional melt intercalation methods with non-swollen organic clay. The IIR/clay nanocomposites which were prepared by the novel method could be used in rubber products which require a high barrier to gas, such as tire inner-tube and inner-liner. \u00a9 2007.",

The results showed that a significant filler network was already formed in the initial compounds because of the nanoscale dispersion and the high width/thickness ratio of graphite even at a content of less than 5 phr. During shearing, the graphite dispersion evolution is strongly related to the initial filler network. The filler network as well as the dispersion could also be obviously altered by changing the curing pressure and temperature during vulcanization, suggesting that the initial fine dispersion of graphite in the rubber/graphite nanocomposites could be maintained by reducing shear and by curing at a higher temperature and at a lower pressure.\u00a92013 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Rare earth elements (REEs) and their composites could promote the growth of agricultural products, which, hence, have been\n widely used in farms as an important trace fertilizer, especially in China. In this work, two kinds of rare earth organic\n complex europium-salicylic acid-[1,10-phenanthroline] (Eu(Sal)3Phen) and praseodymium-salicylic acid-[1,10-phenanthroline] (Pr(Sal)3Phen) were synthesized first. Then we prepared the Eu,Pr(Sal)3Phen/LLDPE composites by adding Eu(Sal)3Phen and Pr(Sal)3Phen (with a weight ratio of Eu(Sal)3Phen: Pr(Sal)3Phen\u00a0=\u00a01:1) into the linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) matrix by mechanical mixing. The experiments of fluorescent properties\n showed that the composites can absorb ultraviolet light (UV) (wavelength range of 200\u2013400\u00a0nm) and can emit red-orange light\n (wavelength range of 600\u2013680\u00a0nm), which is necessary light source for growth crop. The fluorescent properties of Eu,Pr(Sal)3Phen treated for different time at 160\u00a0\u00b0C and treated for 10\u00a0min at different temperatures have been tested. It has been found\n that the fluorescent intensity of the Eu,Pr(Sal)3Phen reduced with the increase of treated time and treated temperature. Furthermore, the fluorescent properties of Eu,Pr(Sal)3Phen/LLDPE composites placed at room temperature for different time have been analyzed. It has been proved that the decrease\n in the fluorescent intensity of the Eu,Pr(Sal)3Phen/LLDPE composites is not evident within 3\u00a0months. Therefore, these composites meet the requirements of growth crop in\n one quarter, sufficiently.",

        "abstract": "The control of the self-assembly of the nanocrystals into ordered structures has been extensively investigated, but fewer efforts have been devoted to studying one-component polymer-grafted nanoparticles (OPNPs). Herein, through coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation, we design a novel nanoparticle grafted with polymer chains, focusing on its self-assembled structures. First, we examine the effects of length and density of grafted polymer chains by calculating the radial distribution function between nanoparticles (NPs), and as well as through direct visualization. We observe a monotonic change of the arranged morphology of grafted-NPs as a function of the density of grafted polymer chains, which indicates that the increase of the grafting density contributes to the order of the morphology. Meanwhile, we find that much longer grafted polymer chains worsen the regularity of the morphology. Then we probe the influence of the stiffness of grafted polymer chains (denoted by K ranging from 0 to 500) on the order of grafted-NPs, finding that the order of the structure exhibits a non-monotonic behavior as a function of K at moderate grafting density. For high grafting density, the order of the morphology is initially enhanced, and becomes saturated as a function of K. For the effect of K on the stress-strain behavior, the system with the lowest order demonstrates the most remarkable reinforced mechanical behavior for both low and high grafting density. Last, we establish the phase diagram by varying the stiffness and density of the grafted polymer chains, which contains the amorphous, ordered and superlattice structures, respectively. In general, our simulated results provide guidelines to tailor the self-assembly of the OPNPs by taking advantage of the length, density, and stiffness of grafted polymer chains.",

The microstructure of the remaining micron-sized dispersions in the cured HNBR/ZDMA was verified for the first time, and a new mechanism for in-situ polymerization of ZDMA, i.e., the solid bulk polymerization initialized onto the surface of ZDMA particles, was put forward.

        "abstract": "A new series of soybean-oil-based elastomers poly(epoxidized soybean oil-co-decamethylene diamine) (PESD) was synthesized by ring-opening polymerization from epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) and decamethylene diamine (DDA) in different molar ratios. The effect of the molar ratio on the structure and properties of PESD was identified by various methods. According to the results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and thermogravimetry (TGA), the glycerol center of ESO was broken by ammonolysis as expected in the process of polymerization, which resulted in un-cross-linked elastomers with low glass transition temperatures (Tg) ranging from -30 to -17 \u00b0C. PESD-3 (molar ratio of DDA to ESO is 2:1) was found to have the highest molecular weight and was most suitable for further processing. Then, PESD-3 was successfully cross-linked through succinic anhydride by a general rubber processing method to obtain a cross-linked bioelastomer. The mechanism of chain growth, ammonolysis of ester group, and cross-linking of PESD-3 was studied. The tensile strength of cross-linked PESD could be flexibly adjusted from 0.8 to 8.5 MPa by using different amounts of succinic anhydride without reinforcing fillers. The final bioelastomer possesses good damping property, low water absorption, and low degradation rate in phosphate buffer solution. These properties indicate potential engineering applications. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "In this work, surface modification of fibrillar silicate (FS) is conducted by using supercritical CO2(sc-CO2) technique. For comparison purpose, conventional modification method is also carried out. The results showed that physical adsorption of the modifier (KH570) on FS surface dominated by using conventional method, whereas chemical adsorption dominated by using sc-CO2 technique. In addition, a more uniform adsorption of the modifier on FS surface is successfully obtained by using sc-CO2 method. This is ascribed to the special gaseous and liquid characteristics of sc-CO2, which can facilitate the diffuse and the full contact of KH570 on the whole surface of FS. The modified FS are then melt blended with ethylene-propylene ethylidene norbornene terpolymer (EPDM) to prepare rubber composites with excellent high temperature performance and good ageing resistance. The results showed that a more uniform dispersion of FS in EPDM matrix and a stronger interfacial interaction between FS and EPDM are successfully achieved by surface modification of FS in sc-CO2, which lead to the obviously enhanced mechanical properties of the composites. Our work demonstrates a better surface modification technique for FS to largely improve the interfacial interaction between FS and EPDM and to obtain a high performance FS/EPDM elastomer composites for its wide application such as transmission belts of automobile. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

At the same time, the development of the theory on the rheological behavior, crystallinity and morphology and the usage fields of it was also introduced. It was reported that with the increase dose of waste rubber powder, tensile strength decreases and the elongation at break exhibited the maximum; the particle size of waste rubber powder did not have much influence on the physical properties, when compatilizer and crosslinking agents were added, the properties had a dramatic improvement.",

Stable free radical polymerization of styrene was then carried out using a conventional thermal initiator, dibenzoyl peroxide, along with Br 2 -TEMPO. The obtained polystyrene had two active bromine atoms for ATRP at the \u03c9-end of the chain and was further used as the macroinitiator for ATRP of methyl acrylate and ethyl acrylate to prepare AB 2 -type miktoarm star-shaped copolymers. The molecular weights of the resulting miktoarm star-shaped copolymers at different monomer conversions shifted to higher molecular weights without any trace of the macroinitiator, and increased with monomer conversion.",

Meanwhile, the effects of graphite dispersion and loading content, as well as the applied load and sliding velocity on the tribological behavior of the above composites under dry friction condition were also evaluated. The worn surfaces were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to disclose wear mechanism. As expected, the better the dispersion of graphite, the more remarkable enhancement on tensile and dynamic mechanical properties, and the greater reduction in the coefficient of friction (COF) and specific wear rate (W s). It was found that a small amount of EG could effectively decrease COF and W s of NBR/CB composites because of the formation of graphite lubricant films. The COF and W s of NBR/CB/EG composites show a decreasing trend with a rise in applied load and sliding velocity. NBR/CB/EG nanocomposite always shows a stable wearing process with relatively low COF and W s. It is thought that well-dispersed graphite nano-sheets were beneficial to the formation of a fine and durable lubricant film. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

This article is mainly focused on the influence of particle size and content of magnesium hydroxide (MH) on the flame-retardant properties of asphalt. The limit oxygen index and cone calorimeter results indicate that as the MH content and mesh number increase, the flame-retardant properties of MH-filled flame-retardant asphalt show a rising trend. But the role of particle size in smoke suppression is not obvious. Several tests confirm that the dispersion of the MH have some influence on the flame-retarding effect of asphalt. The 3000 mesh MH for the preparation of flame-retardant asphalt shows optimal performance. The experimental data show that the softening point of flame-retardant asphalt increases, but the ductility and penetration decrease with increasing MH content. MH affects the asphalt viscosity, but not affects the adhesion of the asphalt to gravel. \u00a9 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The PDA functional layer not only improved the dispersion of MWNTs in aqueous solution, but also was used as a platform for subsequent silver nanoparticle immobilization. The surface morphology of the functionalized MWNTs was observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that PDA layers with controlled thickness on the nanometer scale were formed on MWNT surfaces by in situ spontaneous oxidative polymerization of dopamine, and that high-density of homogeneously dispersed spherical silver nanoparticles with sizes of 3-4 nm were immobilized on their outer surface. The space between spherical silver nanoparticles is less than 10 nm.

        "abstract": "To obtain a dielectric elastomer with excellent dielectric properties and actuated strain, we used bio-inspired dopamine to functionalize the surface of barium titanate (BT) particles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to confirm that a poly(dopamine) (PDA) layer of ca. 3.0 nm had been successfully deposited on the surface of the barium titanate particles. With the introduction of the PDA layer, the compatibility between the barium titanate filler and the elastomer matrix (hydrogenated nitrile-butadiene rubber) was significantly improved, which also resulted in the composites displaying better filler dispersion, higher dielectric constant, lower dielectric loss, and higher electric breakdown field compared with composites filled with pristine BT particles. Furthermore, the composites filled with PDA-coated BT (BT-PDA) exhibited higher electromechanical sensitivity (\u03b2) than the composites filled with pristine BT, leading to increased actuated strains. Nevertheless, the \u03b2 of composites filled with pristine BT decreased with increasing content of filler, resulting in decreased actuated strains. Finally, a large actuated strain of 20% without any prestrain was achieved by the composite filled with BT-PDA, which is 54% larger than the largest actuated strain of the polymer without functionalized filler. Moreover, the dopamine functionalization method is simple, efficient, nontoxic, and easy to control, and can be used as a general strategy for improving the dielectric constant, breakdown strength, and actuated strain of dielectric elastomers. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "Silicone rubber microwave absorbing materials (RMAMs) based on ferrite as the major absorbent were prepared by the mechanical blending method. The determining factors for the complex permittivity, complex permeability, and reflectivity of RMAM were thoroughly investigated with various samples including different crystal structures of Ba-ferrite (M-type, W-type, and Y-type), the ferrite with doped elements (Ba, Sr), the materials' thickness, the combination ratio of ferrite and carbonyl iron. The effects of surface modification and loading amount of ferrite on the mechanical properties, processing performance, and absorbing property of RMAM were also assessed.

Keywords Rubber microwave absorbing material (RMAM) Silicone rubber Ferrite Carbonyl iron Silane coupling agent 1 Introduction In recent years, considerable attention has been paid to microwave absorbing materials [1,2] . In addition to excellent absorbing property, rubber microwave absorbing materials (RMAMs) possess unique properties such as softness, light weight, and high deformation recovery. They can also fit a variety of complicated shapes and surfaces through elastic deformation, performing the dual function of environmental sealing and microwave absorbing. What's more, they can be easily tailored to create a lot of products with complicated shapes [3\u20136] . Feng et al. [7\u20139] reported that when the mass ratio of the carbonyl iron (CI) to ethylene propylene terpolymer (EPDM) was 1050:100, the reflectivity of RMAM with 0.8 mm thickness was less than \u221210 dB in the frequency range 8\u201318 GHz, and the frequency bandwidth of the double-absorber composed of CI/EPDM and ferrite/EPDM was wider than anyone of them. Pinho et al. [10] studied the absorbing property of chloroprene rubber (CR) employing carbonyl iron(CI) or ferrite (Co-TiBaHF) as absorbent, and discovered that of the two composites CI/CR and Co-TiBaHF/CR, CI/CR showed better microwave absorption than Co-TiBaHF/CR for the X-band (8\u201312 GHz), while the opposite is true for the Ku-band with the total amount of absorbents reaching 80%. At such a high loading level, it is difficult to uniformly disperse the inorganic absorbent in the rubber matrix, and the filler-rubber adhesion is weak because of incompatibility. Both factors adversely affect the mechanical properties and processing performance of the rubber, making the rubber lose its softness and elasticity, which increase the cost. RMAM with low density, low hardness, wide absorption frequency bandwidth, and good mechanical properties and processing performance is always desired. Previous researches paid attention mainly to the microwave absorbing property of RMAM, and now the focus is shifted to the detailed evaluation of the determining factors as well as their effects on the absorbing property and mechanical properties in order to develop RMAM with good overall properties. Since silicone rubber has very flexible macromolecular chains, low cohesive energy density and good Si\u2013O bond thermal stability, it exhibits excellent resistance to high and low temperatures (\u2212100 to 250 \u00b0C), low viscosity, low hardness, high elasticity, and excellent filling capacity, and it is widely used in aerospace materials [11] . In this study, RMAM consisting of methyl vinyl silicone rubber as matrix and ferrite as the major absorbent was prepared by the mechanical blending method. The determining factors for the complex permittivity, complex permeability, and the reflectivity of the composites were thoroughly investigated with various composites including different crystal structures of Ba-ferrite (M-type, W-type, and Y-type), the ferrite with doped elements (Ba, Sr), the materials' thickness, and the ratio of ferrite to carbonyl iron. The effects of surface modification and loading amount of ferrite on the mechanical properties, processing performance, and the absorbing property of RMAM were also assessed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Methyl vinyl silicone rubber (110-2) was obtained from the Chenguang Chemical Institute of Zhonghao Group (Sichuan province, China). M-type Ba-ferrite (Ba-M), Y-type Ba-ferrite (Ba-Y), and W-type Sr-ferrite (Sr-W) were purchased from the Beikuang Magnetic Materials Co. Ltd, (Beijing, China). The densities of Ba-M, Ba-Y, and Sr-W are 6.0, 5.9, and 5.3 g/cm 3 , respectively. W-type Ba-ferrite (Ba-W, density 5.8 g/cm 3 ) was bought from the Aerospace Materials and Technology Research Institute (Beijing, China). Carbonyl iron (CI, density 7.8 g/cm 3 ) was available from the Jilin Jien Nickel Factory (Jilin province, China). Vinyltriacetoxy silane (A151, CH 2 =CH-Si-(OOCCH 3 ) 3 ) was used as surface modifier for absorbing fillers and was available from the Beijing Reagent Chemical Corporation (Beijing, China). 2,5-Dimethyl-2,5-bis(tert-butyl peroxy) hexane (DBPMH), which was used as a vulcanizer, was purchased from the Qiangsheng Chemical Co. Ltd, China (Jiangsu Province, China). 2.2 Sample preparation The absorbents and vulcanizer were in turn blended into silicone rubber by a two-roll mill (Guangdong Zhanjiang Machinery Factory, China). The loading amount of the vulcanizer (DBPMH) was 2 phr while the amounts of the absorbents varied. The blend was cured by compression molding on a hot press. The vulcanizing temperature was 165 \u00b0C, the pressure was 10 MPa and the curing time was determined by a disk rheometer. The vulcanized samples were used for test and analysis. 2.3 Test and characterization The crystal structure of microwave absorbing fillers was observed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) (D/Max 2500 VB2+/PC, Rigaku Corporation, Japan) techniques using copper K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb =0.154 nm) over a 2 \u03b8 range of 3\u201390\u00b0. The evaluation of microwave absorbing property was carried out with the arch method using a vector network analyzer (N5230A, America Agilent Corporation, USA). An aluminum plate was used as the underboarding. The electromagnetic wave was entered perpendicularly, and the frequency range was 2\u201318 GHz. The size of the sample was 180 mm\u00d7180 mm. Electromagnetic parameters were measured with the coaxial method using a vector network analyzer (PNAE8368B, America Agilent Corporation, USA) and an APC-7 mm coaxial line. The frequency range was 2\u201318 GHz. The test sample has a toroidal shape with an outer diameter of 7.0 mm and inner diameter of 3.0 mm. Tensile properties were measured with a tensile tester (CMT4104, Shenzhen New Batching Technology Company, China) according to Chinese standard GB/T 528-1998. The test for hardness was carried out using a Shore Type A durometer. Density was determined according to the Chinese standards GB/T 531-1999 and GB/T 6343-2009. Processing performance of the uncured blend was evaluated based on the variation of dynamic storage modulus with shear strain using a rubber processing analyzer (RPA-2000, America Alpha Company, USA). The test temperature was 60 \u00b0C, the frequency was 1 Hz, and the strain range was 0.28\u2013250.96%. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effect of crystal structure of ferrite This study compared the absorbing characteristics of silicone rubber filled with three different crystal structures of barium ferrite: M-type (Ba-M), W-type (Ba-W), and Y-type (Ba-Y). Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of Ba-ferrites with different crystal structures. Fig. 1 (a) reveals an M-type Ba-ferrite structure, which had the characteristic peaks matching well with the standard pattern of M-type barium ferrite BaFe 12 O 19 . Fig. 1 (b) shows the same crystal structure as BaMe 2 Fe 16 O 27 , which belongs to the W-type hexagonal ferrite. Ba-Y's crystal structure is the same as that of Ba 2 Me 2 Fe 12 O 22 , which belongs to the Y-type hexagonal ferrite ( Fig. 1 (c)). Some small peaks of Fe 2 O 3 could be found in the reflection peaks at about 28.5\u00b0 in Fig. 1 (c). No obvious effect of Fe 2 O 3 on the microwave absorption properties was observed. As a result, the small amount of Fe 2 O 3 could be omitted. Electromagnetic parameters (including complex permeability \u03bc r= \u03bc \u2032\u2212 j\u03bc \u2033 and complex permittivity \u03b5 r = \u03b5 \u2032\u2212 j\u03b5 \u2033, where \u03bc \u2032 is the real part of the complex permeability related to the stored energy within the magnetic material, \u03bc \u2033 is the imaginary part of the complex permeability related to the dissipation (or loss) of energy within the magnetic material, \u03b5 \u2032 is the real part of the permittivity related to the stored energy within the medium, and \u03b5 \u2033 is the imaginary part of the permittivity related to the dissipation (or loss) of energy within the medium). These are intrinsic properties of RMAM, which play a major role in determining the absorbing property. Fig. 2 displays the electromagnetic parameters of silicone rubber based on Ba-ferrite with different crystal structures. There is no difference among the dielectric properties of RMAMs based on Ba-M, Ba-W, and Ba-Y. \u03b5 \u2032 is about 8, and \u03b5 \u2033 is not more than 1.0, so the dielectric loss ( tg\u03b4 e ) is very small. \u03bc \u2033 of Ba-M based RMAM remains zero in the frequency range of 2\u201318 GHz, so magnetic loss ( tg\u03b4 m ) is also zero, indicating that the electromagnetic wave in the absorber could be not absorbed but passed through after the reflection via the aluminum underboarding. The magnetic loss is higher for the other two types of RMAM than for Ba-M based RMAM. In the frequency range of 8\u201318 GHz, Ba-W based RMAM has a maximum tg\u03b4 m value of 1.9 in the frequency range 2\u20138 GHz. As the electrical resistivity of the ferrite is high, the magnetic loss is larger than the dielectric loss, indicating that barium ferrite mainly absorbs electromagnetic wave through the magnetic loss. The frequency of the studied band is high and the amplitude is generally small, and the hysteresis effect and the eddying effect in the magnetic loss are small too. Thus, the magnetic loss is mainly attributed to natural resonance and domain-wall resonance. It should be noticed that the crystal structure of ferrite has a large effect on electromagnetic parameters. Fig. 3 shows the reflectivity of silicone rubber based on Ba-ferrite with different crystal structures. The peak value is the maximum microwave absorption, and the lower reflectivity implies a better absorption property. Fig. 3 show that RMAM based on Ba-M almost has no absorption ability in the whole frequency range of 2\u201318 GHz, and all of the electromagnetic waves are reflected. The Ba-Y based RMAM has poor microwave absorption, and its minimum reflectivity is higher than \u22125 dB. Ba-W based RMAM has a reflectivity of less than \u22129 dB in the frequency range of 8\u201318 GHz, so it can be used as a RMAM with good microwave absorption in a wide frequency bandwidth. According to the impedance matching principle between the absorbing material and free space [12,13] , when the electromagnetic wave entered perpendicularly from the free air, in which the impedance is Z 0 =1, into the absorbing material whose impedance is Z in , reflection would happen. The reflectance ratio (RL) is calculated according to the following equation (A1) : (A1) RL ( dB ) = 20 lg | ( Z in \u2212 1 ) ( Z in + 1 ) | where Z in is the input impedance of the absorbing material. When the entrance wave is a plane electromagnetic wave, the normalized input impedance of absorbing material is achieved. (A2) Z in = ( \u03bc r \u03b5 r ) 1 / 2 tan h [ j ( 2 \u03c0 f d C ) ( \u03bc r \u03b5 r ) 1 / 2 ] According to Eqs. (A1) and (A2) , the reflectance ratio of the absorbing material is a function of six parameters: \u03b5 \u2032, \u03b5 \u2033, \u03bc \u2032, \u03bc \u2033, frequency f , and thickness d . For the given electromagnetic parameters, the reflectivity of RMAMs with different thicknesses at each frequency can be calculated according to Eqs. (A1) and (A2) . As seen in Fig. 3 , the calculated reflectivity curve is similar to the measured curve, but somewhat lower, probably because of the second absorbing loss caused by the reflected wave during testing. 3.2 Effect of doped chemical element in ferrite Fig. 4 reveals the electromagnetic parameters of absorbing silicone rubber filled with Ba- and Sr-ferrite. As seen in Fig. 4 (a) and (c), the permittivity of these two absorbing materials is hardly different. \u03b5 \u2032 of both materials is between 7 and 8 . \u03b5 \u2033 of Ba-W based RMAM is close to zero, and \u03b5 \u2033 of Sr-W is between 0 and 1, thus Sr-W based RMAM exhibits higher dielectric loss ( tg\u03b4 e ) than Ba-W based RMAM, and the maximum reaches 0.15. The same is true for the permeability and the magnetic loss, but the maximum magnetic loss ( tg\u03b4 m ) is 0.4\u20131.0 in the frequency of 8\u201318 GHz, higher than the corresponding maximum dielectric loss, as shown in Fig. 4 (b) and (d). In the ferrite, Sr 2+ instead of Ba 2+ would lead to an increase in dielectric loss because of the decrease in electrical resistivity [14] . Fig. 5 illustrates the reflectivity of Ba-ferrite-filled and Sr-ferrite-filled absorbing silicone rubber. The absorption curves for the two materials are similar. Both materials have good absorbing performance in the frequency of 8\u201318 GHz, suitable for microwave absorption at high frequencies such as the X-wave band (8\u201312 GHz) and Ku-wave band (12\u201318 GHz). Compared to the other, Sr-W based RMAM has better absorbing performance because its reflectivity is lower than \u221210 dB in the frequency of 9\u201318 GHz, and the peak value is lower than \u221230 dB (equivalent to 99.9% absorption). Both results can be attributed to the increase in dielectric loss. 3.3 Effect of amount of strontium ferrite As expressed in Fig. 6 a and b, \u03b5 \u2032, \u03b5 \u2033, \u03bc \u2032, and \u03bc \u2033 of RMAM all increase with the increase in strontium ferrite. \u03b5 \u2032 and \u03b5 \u2033 change little with frequency in the whole band of 2\u201318 GHz. But \u03bc \u2032 in high frequency is lowered by half from low and \u03bc \u2033 is increased by 5 times frequency to high frequency. \u03b5 r is closer to \u03bc r at low frequencies than that at high frequencies, indicating that it is more easy to reach impedance matching at low frequencies. Fig. 6 c and d shows that as the amount of strontium ferrite increases, dielectric loss ( tg\u03b4 e ) at high frequencies increases, but magnetic loss ( tg\u03b4 m ) increases even more. According to the equivalent electromagnetic theory, the equivalent electromagnetic parameters of the absorbing material are proportional to the absorbent volume content used. The higher the content of absorbent in the materials, the closer the equivalent electromagnetic parameters of the materials to the theoretical values [15,16] . Dielectric loss is related to the volume resistivity of the absorbing material, and the volume resistivity of strontium ferrite is much lower than that of silicone rubber. The increase in the loading amount of strontium ferrite will decrease the volume resistivity, leading to the increase in tg\u03b4 e . Fig. 7 shows the reflectivity of absorbing silicone rubber with different amounts of Sr-ferrite. With the content of strontium ferrite increasing from 250 to 450 phr, all absorption curves have two absorption peaks at high frequencies, and the absorption peaks move towards low frequency with the increase in reflectivity. When the amount of Sr-ferrite is up to 650 phr, the peak value of absorption appears at 9 GHz, and the reflectance ratio increases. Table 1 shows that with the increase in Sr-ferrite, the absorption frequency bandwidth and absorption peak area of the reflectivity less than \u221210 dB (corresponding to 90% absorption) increase and then decrease (the absorption peak area in dB is defined as the area by integrating the curve of the reflectance ratio versus the frequency in the range of less than \u221210 dB, e.g., the shadow area in Fig. 7 represents the absorption peak area by integrating the curve of the reflectance ratio versus the frequency in the range of less than \u221210 dB, When the amount of Sr-ferrite is 250 phr). The absorbing property is the best at the amount of Sr-ferrite 450 phr, where the frequency bandwidth reaches 9 GHz (9\u201318 GHz) at the reflectivity lower than \u221210 dB, and the reflectivity peak value is less than \u221230 dB (corresponding to 99.9% absorption). Fig. 8 shows the shear strain dependence of the storage modulus of absorbing silicone rubber (uncured) with different amounts of Sr-ferrite. With the increase in the amount of Sr-ferrite, the dynamic storage modulus (G\u2032) increases, implying the formation of strong filler network configuration (Payne effect), the increase in viscosity and the decrease in processing performance [17\u201319] . Especially when the content of Sr-ferrite exceeds 450 phr, because of the high viscosity, it is hard to precisely control the thickness of RMAM sheet in compression molding or injection molding. As seen from Table 2 , with the increase in the content of Sr-ferrite, the tensile strength and elongation at break decrease, while the density and hardness increase. The tensile strength and elongation at break are significantly lower for RMAM than for the neat rubber even at the low loading level of 250 phr. In view of absorbing property, the optimum content of Sr-ferrite is 450 phr. As the adhesion of the ferrite fillers to the rubber is poor, and the particle size is typically a few microns to tens of microns, a large amount of addition could affect the mechanical properties and the processing performance of the rubber. The particle size and the loading amount of absorbent have a large effect on not only the mechanical property and processing performance, but also the absorption property. If the cost and the density are also considered, the amount of the absorbing filler should be reduced as much as possible provided that the requirements for the absorbing property are met. The above results suggest that some novel absorbents with smaller size and light weight be developed. 3.4 Effect of surface modification Silane coupling agent is always used in surface modification of inorganic fillers to improve the filler-rubber bonding and the dispersion of the fillers [20] . As shown in Fig. 9 , with the increase in the amount of silane A151, G\u2032 of the rubber compounds decreases, indicating a weak filler network configuration as well as good processing property. Table 3 shows that after the surface modification of Sr-ferrite, the tensile strength of the absorbing rubber increases, and the elongation at break decreases. But the electromagnetic parameters and the reflectivity hardly change (not provided here). 3.5 Effect of thickness of RMAM Fig. 10 illustrates the reflectivity of absorbing silicone rubber with different thicknesses. It is clear that the absorption peak moves toward low frequency with the increase in thickness, the frequency bandwidth is narrowed, and the reflectivity decreases and then increases in the studied frequency range. However, the absorption frequency bandwidth for the reflectivity less than \u221210 dB increases and subsequently decreases. The reflectivity peak for RMAMs with 1.1 and 1.5 mm thickness appeared above 18 GHz, but the absorbing properties of RMAMs with thickness of 1.5 and 1.7 mm is good, the reflectivity being less than \u221210 dB in the frequency of 9\u201318 GHz. When the thickness of the RMAM is greater than 2.6 mm, the absorption peak moves to about 7 GHz, and there will be a decrease in both the absorption frequency bandwidth and the reflectivity. The frequency bandwidth for reflectivity less than \u221210 dB is only 3 GHz. The optimum thickness is 1.5\u20131.7 mm. Even at constant volume fraction of absorbent, the absorbing property is not directly proportional to the thickness. The increase in RMAM thickness leads to the increase in cost and weight. By comparing Fig. 10 with Fig. 7 , it can be seen that the effect of RMAM thickness on the absorbing property is similar to that of the amount of absorbent. According to the microwave absorption theory [12,13] , the absorbing property is related to not only the absorbent, but also the thickness of the material and the required absorption wave band. This seems to imply that microwave absorbing property is not directly proportional to the thickness of the absorbing material and the amount of absorbent. Attention should be paid to optimize the absorbent's content and the thickness of the RMAM in the required frequency range. 3.6 The combination of Sr-ferrite and carbonyl iron Carbonyl iron absorbing filler is more suitable for absorbing low-frequency radar waves, whereas the Sr-ferrite is more suitable for absorbing high-frequency radar waves. The combination of ferrite and carbonyl iron is expected to extend the microwave absorption frequency bandwidth and enhance the absorbing property. For comparison purposes, the loading amount of absorbents should be based on volume fraction since the densities of the absorbents are greatly different. Fig. 11 shows the reflectivity of absorbing silicone rubber with different volume fractions of Sr-ferrite (Sr-W) and carbonyl iron (CI). When carbonyl iron is used together with Sr-ferrite, the absorption peak inclines to appear between the absorption peaks of two absorbents used individually. With the increase in the volume fraction of carbonyl iron, the absorption peak moves toward low frequency, and the frequency bandwidth narrows down. With the increase in the volume fraction of Sr-ferrite, the absorption peak moves toward high frequency to even higher than 18 GHz, and the frequency bandwidth broadens. Tables 4 and 5 show that with the change in the relative volume proportion of carbonyl iron and Sr-ferrite used in the silicone rubber, the microwave absorption frequency bandwidth and the absorption peak area (<\u221210 dB) all increase and later decrease. It is thought that there will be a synergistic effect if these two kinds of absorbents are used in an appropriate proportion. The larger the volume fraction of the absorbents, the wider the absorption frequency bandwidth and the larger the absorption peak area (<\u221210 dB). When the total volume fraction of absorbents is 38%, the optimum ratio of CI to Sr-W is 26:12, where RMAM exhibits the best absorbing property with the widest absorption frequency bandwidth (5.3 GHz) and the maximum absorption area (\u221273 dB) (seen in Table 4 ). When the total volume fraction of absorbents is 51%, the optimum ratio of CI to Sr-W is 17:34, where the frequency bandwidth (<\u221210 dB) is about 8 GHz and the absorption area is \u221299 dB (seen in Table 5 ). 4 Conclusions W-type barium ferrite based RMAM exhibits better absorbing property at high frequencies (8\u201318 GHz) than the other two barium ferrites (M-type and Y-type), and the absorbing property of RMAM based on Sr-ferrite is the best. It is found that the effect of RMAM thickness on the absorbing property is similar to that of the amount of absorbent. As the thickness of RMAM and the amount of absorbents increase, the absorption peak moves toward low frequency, absorption frequency bandwidth is narrowed, and the reflectivity decreases and later increases. Surface modification of the absorbent with silane coupling agent could to some extent mitigate the deterioration of mechanical properties and processing performance, which is caused by the addition of a large amount of absorbents. It is concluded that there will be a synergistic effect when carbonyl iron is used in combination with Sr-ferrite in an appropriate proportion. Much attention should be paid to the design of RMAM with excellent absorbing property in the required frequency range by optimizing the absorbent type and content, and the thickness of the RMAM.

        "abstract": "By employing coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the fracture behavior of polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) filled with polymer-grafted nanoparticles (NPs) in detail by particularly regulating the grafting density and the length of the grafted chain. By calculating their fracture energy, we observed that their rupture properties first increase and then decrease with the increase of the grafting density or the length of the grafted chains. Their bond orientation degree and their van der Waals energy change are characterized to understand their fracture behavior. To further explain it, we analyzed the contributions of the matrix chains, grafted chains, and NPs to the total stress. It is interesting to find that the stress borne by one bead of matrix chains or NPs gradually increases with the grafting density, while the stress borne by the grafted chains first increases and then decreases. In addition, the stress borne by one bead of matrix chains or grafted chains gradually increases with the length of the grafted chains, while the stress borne by NPs remains nearly unchanged. As a result of these contributions, the optimal fracture properties appear at the moderate grafting density or length of the grafted chain. Then, the number of voids is quantified, which first increases and then decreases with strain because of the coalescence of small voids into large ones. Accompanying this, the maximum void size increases significantly. Furthermore, the maximum number of voids increases with the grafting density, while it is nearly independent of the length of the grafted chain. In particular, the voids are preferably generated at the end beads of the chains or at the surfaces of the NPs. In summary, this work could provide some further understanding of how the grafted chains affect the fracture properties of the PNCs.",

The effects of the content of dicumyl peroxide (DCP) on the properties of the composites were investigated. We found that an increase in DCP amount led to a large increase in water swelling ratio and meanwhile a decrease in the mass loss ratio. Further, the composites were swollen uniformly in water and thus kept their original shapes well. The hardness and stresses at 100% and 300% increased with the increase in DCP amount. The addition of DCP facilitated the homopolymerization of NaAA while decreased the esterification reaction between NaAA and CR, which was verified by vulcanization curves, DSC and FT-IR. The morphology of the composites before and after water immersion was observed by optical transmission microscopy and indicated that the starch was homogenously dispersed in the composites.",

        "title": "Novel percolation phenomena and mechanism of strengthening elastomers by nanofillers.",
        "abstract": "Nano-strengthening by employing nanoparticles is necessary for high-efficiency strengthening of elastomers, which has already been validated by numerous researches and industrial applications, but the underlying mechanism is still an open challenge. In this work, we mainly focus our attention on studying the variation of the tensile strength of nanofilled elastomers by gradually increasing the filler content, within a low loading range. Interestingly, the percolation phenomenon is observed in the relationship between the tensile strength and the filler loading, which shares some similarities with the percolation phenomenon occurring in rubber toughened plastics. That is, as the loading of nanofillers (carbon black, zinc oxide) increases, the tensile strength of rubber nanocomposites (SBR, EPDM) increases slowly at first, then increases abruptly and finally levels off. Meanwhile, the bigger the particle size, the higher the filler content at the percolation point, and the lower the corresponding tensile strength of rubber nanocomposites. The concept of a critical particle-particle distance (CPD) is proposed to explain the observed percolation phenomenon. It is suggested that rubber strengthening through nanoparticles is attributed to the formation of stretched straight polymer chains between neighbor particles, induced by the slippage of adsorbed polymer chains on the filler surface during tension. Meanwhile, the factors to govern this CPD and the critical minimum particle size (CMPS) figured out in this work are both discussed and analyzed in detail. Within the framework of this percolation phenomenon, this paper also clearly answers two important and intriguing issues: (1) why is it necessary and essential to strengthen elastomers through nanofillers; (2) why does it need enough loading of nanofillers to effectively strengthen elastomers. Moreover, on the basis of the percolation phenomenon, we give out some guidance for reinforcement design of rubbery materials: the interfacial interactions between rubber and fillers cannot be complete chemical bonding, and partial physical absorption of macromolecular chains on the filler surface is necessary, otherwise the formation of stretched straight chains would be seriously hindered. There should exist such an optimum crosslinking density for a certain filler reinforced rubber system, and as well an optimum filler loading for rubber strengthening. Additionally, the different percolation behaviors of Young's modulus, the tensile strength and the electrical conductivity are compared and analyzed in our work. Lastly, molecular simulation indicates that it is not possible to strengthen glassy or hard polymer matrices by incorporating spherical nanoparticles. In general, by providing substantial experimental data and detailed analyses, this work is believed to promote the fundamental understanding of rubber reinforcement, as well provide better guidance for the design of high-performance and multi-functional rubber nanocomposites.",

Moreover, the nano-sized stacking layers were not intercalated. Compared with silica or carbon black, the incorporation of rectorite in NBR leads to stronger filler network in the compound and further results in higher storage modulus of the vulcanizate.

        "abstract": "Liquid reclaimed rubber (LRR) was produced from ground tire rubber (GTR) in a continuous operation by using a co-rotating twin-screw extruder. The effects of reclaiming recipe, screw configuration combination, barrel temperature, and screw speed on the degree of reclamation were investigated. Through the adjustment of these conditions, an LRR with a sol fraction of 73.5% was obtained. Characterizations of the LRR by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and re-vulcanized ability tests showed that the LRR had unique properties - low viscosity, good compatibility with natural rubber (NR), and re-vulcanized ability. Because of these properties of LRR, it was used as reactive polymeric plasticizer in NR to replace the conventional oils such as the environmental aromatic oil (EAO) used in this study. The plasticizing effect, acetone extraction, mechanical properties, and thermostability of the LRR/NR compounds were investigated and compared with those of EAO/NR compounds. The results show that the plasticizing efficiency of LRR is somehow lower than that of EAO. In addition, the LRR-plasticized NR has higher tensile strength, modulus at 100% and 300% elongation, hardness, extraction resistance, and thermostability than EAO-plasticized NR. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "On the basis of an idealized model of an elastomer, we use molecular dynamics simulations to explore the effects of pressure on the glass transition, structure, and dynamics of the model elastomer. The simulated results indicate that with the pressure increasing, the glass transition temperature T(g) increases while the glass transition strength decreases, which is in accordance with the experimental result from Colucci et al. [J. Polym. Sci., B: Polym. Phys. 35, 1561 (1997)] For the structure of the elastomer, it is found that the intramolecular packing remains nearly unchanged over the pressure range studied, also validated by the independence of the chain size and shape on the pressure, while the intermolecular distribution exhibits a more efficient packing effect at high pressures. By analyzing the end-to-end vector correlation and incoherent intermediate dynamic structure factor, which are well fitted by a stretched exponential Kohlrauch-William-Watts (KWW) function, we observe that the time-pressure superposition principle (TPSP) takes effect at the chain length scale, while at the segmental length scale the TPSP does not completely hold, attributed to the enhanced dynamic heterogeneity with the pressure increasing, which is evidenced by the beta values in stretched exponential fitting over the pressure range studied. Extracting the characteristic relaxation time from the KWW function, and then plotting the logarithm of the characteristic relaxation time versus the pressure, we observe a good linear relationship and find that the pressure exerts nearly the same effect on the relaxation behavior at both the segmental and chain length scales. This point is further validated by almost the same dependence of the alpha-relaxation time for three representative q wave vectors, indicating that the segmental and chain relaxations of the elastomer are influenced similarly by the pressure variation and the same physical processes are responsible for relaxation at the probed length scales. The calculated activation volume is independent of pressure at fixed temperature but increases with the temperature decreasing at fixed pressure. Finally, the pressure effect on the stress autocorrelation function is also examined, and a more difficult trend for stress relaxation and dissipation of the elastomer at high pressure is found. It is expected that all these simulated results would shed some light on the relevant experimental and theoretical studies.",

        "abstract": "By tuning the polymer-filler interaction, filler size and filler loading, we use a coarse-grained model-based molecular dynamics simulation to study the polymer-filler interfacial structural (the orientations at the bond, segment and chain length scales, chain size and conformation), dynamic and stress-strain properties. Simulated results indicate that the interfacial region is composed of partial segments of different polymer chains, which is consistent with the experimental results presented by Chen et al. (Macromolecules, 2010, 43, 1076). Moreover, it is found that the interfacial region is within one single chain size (R(g)) range, irrespective of the polymer-filler interaction and the filler size, beyond which the bulk behavior appears. In the interfacial region, the orientation and dynamic behaviors are induced by the interfacial enthalpy, while the size and conformation of polymer chains near the filler are controlled by the configurational entropy. In the case of strong polymer-filler interaction (equivalent to the hydrogen bond), the innerest adsorbed polymer segments still undergo adsorption-desorption process, the transport of chain mass center in the interfacial region exhibits away from the glassy behavior, and no plastic-like yielding point appears in the stress-strain curve, which indicates that although the mobility of interfacial polymer chains is restricted, there exist no \"polymer glassy layers\" surrounding the filler. In addition, it is evidenced that the filler particle prefers selectively adsorbing the long polymer chains for attractive polymer-filler interaction, validating the experimental explanation of the change of the bound rubber (BR). In short, this work provides important information for further experimental and simulation studies of polymer-nanoparticle interfacial behavior.",

        "abstract": "The morphologies of various ZDMA-reinforced elastomers, including styrene butadiene rubber (SBR), ethylene\u2013propylene\u2013diene monomer (EPDM), nitrile\u2013butadiene rubber (NBR), ethylene\u2013propylene monomer (EPM), poly(\u03b1-octylene-co-ethylene) elastomer (POE) and hydrogenated nitrile\u2013butadiene rubber (HNBR), were studied by using SEM and TEM. The observation on the compounds showed that during the compounding process, the dimension of ZDMA particles reduced, and could even form dispersion structures with nanometer size (<100 nm). It is shear stress of compounds during mixing rather than polarity of matrix rubber that plays the most important role to determine dispersion state of ZDMA in compounds. High shear stress facilitates dispersion of ZDMA. Only in elastomers having the lower shear stress such as POE and EPM, original dimension features of ZDMA particles make considerable effects on dispersion level of ZDMA in compounds. The observation on cured composites displayed that there are two kinds of micro-dispersed structures: micron dispersion\u2014residual ZDMA particles and nano-dispersion\u2014the aggregate of poly-ZDMA. The higher saturation and polarity of rubbers and the better dispersion level of ZDMA in compounds benefit in situ polymerization of ZDMA, resulting in the lower amount of residual ZDMA particles (micron dispersion). In the elastomer with higher saturation such as POE, EPM, EPDM and HNBR, the dimensions of nano-dispersions are slightly larger. For the ZDMA/POE, formula effect on morphology of the composite was also discussed. It was found that the loading of ZDMA and peroxide impact remarkably on the amount and dimension of nano-particles in the composite.",

The morphol- ogy, dynamic property, and curing property of the blend were discussed in detail. TEM and SEM observations showed that, no matter how high the blend ratio of UFNBRP to EPDM matrix was, UFNBRP particles always kept being in the dispersion phase because of its extremely high viscos- ity resulting from self-crosslinking, but were not dispersed as nanosize units, as expected. Dynamic properties, illus- trated by DMTA, further demonstrated that two phases exhibited two separate glass transition temperatures, indi- cating distinct phase separation and weak phase interaction. Rubber processing analyzer results showed that inorganic filler as well as UFNBRP particles in EPDM matrix formed a network and blocked the flow properties of the compound. At the same time, the introduction of UFNBRP particles evidently affected the vulcanization of EPDM, when sulfur was used as a vulcanizing agent, and improved the mechan-",

        "abstract": "A novel, effective approach to improve the cutting and chipping resistance (CCR) of carbon black (CB)-filled styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) composite was reported in this study. CCR of SBR was dramatically improved more than 30% by addition of 4 phr nanodispersed clay (NC), while not decreasing the stress at 100% and the Shore A hardness of the composite. The curing characteristics, loss tangent (tan \u03b4), and the strength of filler network of the composites were further measured by a Disk Oscillating Rheometer and a rubber processing analyzer, respectively. It was found that the addition of NC led to a slightly lower crosslink density, higher tan \u03b4, and stronger filler network, which contributed to the higher CCR. Therefore, the novel layered NC is more efficient in improving CCR when compared with CB. The results are expected to promote the application of NC in rubber industry.

        "abstract": "The effects of the cross-linking density on the static and dynamic properties of polymer networks are examined by using a molecular dynamics simulation based on a simple elastomer model. Simulation results indicate that the introduced cross-linking junctions show almost no effect on the static structure factor. The glass transition temperature T(g) increases slightly with the cross-linking density. By analyzing the mean square displacement of the monomers, the chain diffusion, and the incoherent intermediate dynamic structure factor phi(q)(s)(t) at the chain and segmental length scales, it is found that the mobilities of the monomers and chains are retarded and the relaxation behavior is hindered by the cross linking of polymers. Furthermore, the spatial localization of the monomers is also observed at a long time period for a highly cross-linked system. For the cross-linked system, the time-temperature superposition principle is valid at the segmental length scale but breaks down at the chain length scale. The effect of the cross-linking density on the terminal relaxation is investigated by the end-to-end vector correlation, which is well fitted to the Kohlrauch-William-Watts (KWW) or modified KWW functions. The characteristic relaxation time shows an approximately linear relationship with the cross-linking density. It is demonstrated that the relaxation behavior tends to broaden, attributed to the stronger intermolecular coupling or cooperativity induced by the cross linking, suggesting that the system with a higher cross-linking degree becomes more fragile. For the dynamic properties, the bond orientation and the end-to-end distance along the deformed direction, which is an indicator of the entropic change, and the nonbonded energy are examined during the deformation and relaxation processes, respectively. The results explore the molecular mechanism accounting for the residual stress in the stress relaxation of cross-linked elastomer networks.",

We designed and fabricated a next-generation, energy-saving advanced elastomer (AE) based on a macromolecular assembly strategy. This AE delicately balances rolling resistance, wear resistance and wet-skid resistance, addressing the so-called \u201cmagic triangle\u201d that has plagued the tire industry for more than century. This AE crosslinks anionically synthesized hydroxyl-terminated solution-polymerized styrene-butadiene copolymers with highly symmetric isocyanates and polyols to generate a uniform network by macromolecular self-assembly. Remarkably, compared with those of widely commercialized elastomer nanocomposites tailored for \u201cgreen tires\u201d, the wear resistance, rolling resistance and wet-skid resistance of this AE are improved by 94.6%, 69.8% and 13.8%, respectively. This AE affords a new opportunity for the large-scale application of next-generation high-performance automobile tires that will, in part, resolve a serious global energy and environmental crisis.",

The study revealed that the pre-gelation of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) in spin dopes was important to achieve the morphological consistence of the electrospun precursor nanofibers and the resulting final SiO2 nanofibers; additionally, SiO2 nanoparticles appeared to be enriched on the fiber surface, while the surface-roughness and/or porosity of the nanofibers could be controlled through adjusting the incorporation amount of SiO2 nanoparticles. The developed hierarchical electrospun SiO2 nanofibers are expected to have important applications in composites (particularly dental composites) as well as catalyst support and adsorption. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The gas barrier and tensile properties of IIRCN cured under different temperature were examined. The results reveal that high pressure, curing reactions, and reactions of amine intercalants with curing agents together play important roles on determining the final microstruc- tures of cured IIRCNs. Changing curing temperature would dramatically alter intercalated structure, dispersion homo- geneity, filler-rubber interaction strength, and crosslinking density of obtained IIRCN, resulting in great difference in final properties. Finally, some suggestions for the prepara- tion of successful RCNs were proposed. V V C 2008 Wiley Periodi-",

The formula of Sm-complex was determined by infrared spectroscopy (IR) and elementary analysis. The composites were investigated and characterized by photoluminescent (PL) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-rays diffraction (XRD). The characteristic emission fluorescent intensities of the Sm 3+ in both uncured and cured composites increase with the increase of Sm-complex content. For the nitrile rubber composites with the same content of Sm(TTA) 3 phen, the uncured composites are found to have lower luminescent intensity than that of cured composites. To explain this result, we propose that the cross-linking network structure can help to stabilize the coordination environment of the Sm 3+ ion and improve the energy transfer efficiency from the outside energy to the central Sm 3+ ion. In our study, the rare earth organic complexes were dispersed homogeneously into the NBR matrix. The fluorescent intensity of the composites was high and no fluorescent quenching had been observed until the complexes concentration was up to 14.3%.",

We focus on summarizing the progress achieved in the simulation research of three critical topics of ENCs, namely, (i) the dispersion mechanism (particularly polymer-mediated interparticle interaction, the \"many-body\" effect at high filler loading), (ii) the characterization of the nanoscale/microscale structure and dynamics [the modified chain configuration in the presence of nanoparticles (NPs), the interfacial binding strength determining the efficiency of the stress transfer, the possibly altered interfacial chain structure, interfacial segmental dynamics leading to the shift of the glass transition temperature T g, the formation of the filler network and its structure, the chemical cross-linking process], and (iii) the macroscopic viscoelasticity (the Payne effect), mechanical reinforcement, and physical property (thermalconductivity). Sincerecentlyonly limitedsimulation work has been carried out pertaining to ENCs, we discuss these three topicsin light of the simulation and theoretical achievements of polymer nanocomposites (mainly polymer melts filled with NPs). Meanwhile, some relevant experimental studies are also included for better illustration. Furthermore, for each topic, three typically different reinforcing fillers, such as three-dimensional spherical, two-dimensional sheet, and one-dimensional rod NPs, separately corresponding to carbon black or silica, clay sheets, and carbon nanotubes intensively used in the practical applications of ENCs, are illustrated in order. In order to realize a comprehensive understanding of the structure-property relation and in the meantime to provide more practical guidelines for the engineering applications of ENCs, we investigate future simulation opportunities and difficulties.",

Montmorillonite could be dispersed in water as exfoliated layers, then when it was blended with the butadiene/styrene/4-vinyl pyridine copolymer emulsion, the latex particle was interpenetrated with the layer of montmorillonite during the blending process. When the blend was coagulated by hydrochloric acid, the pyridine group reacted with H+, so the copolymer with positive charge could intercalate the layer of montmorillonite that had negative charge. There was some strong bonding between copolymer and montmorillonite in the hybrid. The extracting experiment showed that montmorillonite absorbed some copolymer. It was found that the layer structure of montmorillonite was swollen and became chaos by means of XRD. TEM showed that the layer dispersed uniformly in the copolymer matrix and the distance between the layers was more than 6 nm. Copolymer molecule intercalated montmorillonite layer, so it' s motion was confined by the layers. DSC showed that the Tg of copolymer in hybrid had been changed. The mechanical properties of hybrid had been improved greatly after it was vulcanized, the layer could act as a good reinforcing agent for the composites.",

        "abstract": "The layered polymer nanocomposites have attracted great interest from scientists due to their unique properties. However, the formation mechanism of these nanocomposites in the intercalation process is not fully understood yet. In this work, we simulate the intercalation processing of polymer chains into two layered sheets. By systematically tuning the polymer-sheet interaction, temperature, chain length, organic surfactant modification and interlayer distance, we found that the intermediate polymer-sheet interaction, low polymer molecular weight and large interlayer distance would enhance the intercalation kinetics. However, the presence of surfactants promotes the intercalation process of chains into layered sheets only when the interaction between polymer and surfactants is strong enough. In the intercalation process, the polymer chain first elongates and then contracts. To uncover the mechanism of aggregation and formation of layered sheets-polymer network, we examine the formation of bridge chains between layered sheets. Generally, the polymer chain does not adsorb totally on one single layer, but crosses over from one layer to another. Moreover, the number of bridge chains monotonically decreases with the increase of the polymer-sheet interaction and interlayer distance, but increases with the polymer chain length. It is expected that the structural and dynamic behavior of polymer chains intercalated into the layered sheets could deepen our understanding of polymer nanocomposites filled with layered sheets.

When the UFPNBR/HNCC nanocompound powder is mixed with crude NBR, UFPNBR particles are easily dispersed well in NBR matrix because of their good compatibility, thus the HNCC particles are also dispersed in NBR matrix because of the carrier aidance of UFPNBR particles in 7 phr HNCC loading range, then the novel NBR/UFPNBR/HNCC ternary nanocomposites is fabricated. Compared with NBR/organic reagent-treated HNCC (ONCC) binary composites, the NBR/UFPNBR/HNCC ternary nanocomposites has shorter vulcanization time and better properties of abrasive resistance, oil resistance, dynamic compression properties and flame retardancy in fire. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Both persulfate and redox initiators were used for the copolymerization of diisoamyl itaconate and isoprene at different monomer ratios. Redox-initiated PDII has much higher molecular weight but relatively lower yield than the persulfate-initiated one. PDII with a number-average molecular weight of 352 000 and a glass transition temperature of -39.5 \u00b0C was obtained when the mass ratio of diisoamyl itaconate to isoprene was 80/20. Diisoamyl itaconate and isoprene reactivity ratios were determined by two conventional linear methods: the Fineman-Ross method and the Kelen-T\u00fcd\u00f6s method. Molecular dynamics simulation and FTIR were used to study the interaction between silica and PDII macromolecules, and the result showed that hydrogen bonds were formed between silica silanols and PDII macromolecules. Silica-reinforced PDII exhibited good mechanical performance, such as ultimate tensile strength above 11 MPa and elongation at break above 400%. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.",

Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) characterization shows that the highly filled RCNs (up to \u223c60 wt%) have intercalated silicate structures. TEM observations reveal that the dispersion homogeneity of clay layers improves with increasing content of organically modified clay (OMC). It was shown by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) for the first time that the melt-like thermal transition of alkyl chains of the surfactant of OMC still occurs in the intercalated OMC. Addition of large amount OMC to rubber greatly improves the modulus of material. Highly filled RCNs also possess outstanding gas barrier properties when compared to neat rubbers.",

The dimension of most of ZDMA particles in ZDMA/NBR mixing compounds decreased from several decades \u03bcm before mixing to less than 10 \u03bcm after mixing, due to solvent effect and shear effect. During crosslinking of the composite, in-situ polymerization of ZDMA was initiated by peroxide, thus causing further decreasing of dimension of most of ZDMA particles, and generating PZDMA nano particles (20 \u223c 30 nm). The obtained composite possessing a large amount of nano particles and a little amount of micro particles was termed nano-micro composite. The mechanical properties of NBR composites reinforced by 4 kinds of metallic salts of acrylate were studied. The results showed that their comprehensive properties were better than that of NBR filled with carbon black N 220. These composites possessed high tensile strength, tensile modulus, and high tear strength.",

        "abstract": "A facile and versatile method using a biopolymer as a chelating agent for silver ions and as a reducing agent for the formation of catalytic sites is proposed to prepare polystyrene (PS)/Ag core-shell microspheres. More specifically, the core-shell microspheres were fabricated by electroless plating after the formation of poly(dopamine) (PDA) on the surface of PS microspheres through insitu spontaneous oxidative polymerization of dopamine. The PS-PDA microspheres were characterized by SEM, XPS, and TGA. The results showed that a uniform PDA layer was formed on the PS microsphere surface and the thickness of the PDA layer could be well controlled by varying the concentration of dopamine solution. The PDA layer was used as a chelating agent for silver ions, as a reducing agent for the formation of catalytic sites by reducing the silver ions into silver nanoparticles, and as an adhesion layer between the PS microspheres and silver layer. SEM and XRD results indicate that the diameter of the silver nanoparticles decreased with the increase in the thickness of the PDA layer. The silver nanoparticles could form a continuous and compact silver layer on the surface of the PS microspheres. Furthermore, the PS-PDA/Ag core-shell microspheres showed a good conductivity of 10S/cm and a low effective density of 1.8 g/cm(3), much lower than the corresponding values for block silver. Finally, hollow silver microspheres could be prepared by removing the PS core through calcination. SEM images showed that the hollow Ag microspheres remained unbroken and retained the spherical shape.",

        "abstract": "The present article revisits the role of viscoelasticity in wet skid resistance (WSR) of rubber composites by comparing the effects of carbon black (CB) and silica on WSR. WSR was determined with a British Pendulum Skid Tester on a wet ground glass surface. Under shear and tensile modes, tan\u03b4 of the composites was measured at 0\u00a0\u00b0C and 10\u00a0Hz over a wide range of strain (0.7%\u201310%) via a dynamic mechanical analyzer. For CB-filled composites with nearly the same hardness, a high correlation coefficient ( R 2 \u00a0=\u00a00.98) between WSR and tan\u03b4 under both shear (0.7%\u201310%) and tensile (4%\u20137%) modes was obtained. Tan\u03b4 at tensile strain of 4% was thus adopted as a parameter to characterize viscoelasticity. For rubber composites with rough surface, WSR and tan\u03b4 showed a high correlation in styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) composites individually filled with CB and silica, while for rubber composites with smooth surface, a high correlation was also observed but did not depend on the type of filler. Silica-filled SBR composites showed higher WSR, when compared with those filled with CB, mainly due to the higher nanohardness of silica. All the above results demonstrate that WSR can be predicted from viscoelasticity for composites with similar surface roughness and micro-hardness.",

The properties of the HXNBR rubber, including film surface morphology, physical properties, thermal stability and ageing properties, were investigated. FTIR spectroscopy was used to confirm the HXNBR structure, from which the degree of hydrogenation can be obtained. The morphology of the film surface was monitored by atomic force microscopy, which confirmed that HXNBR latex can form a continuous film with good cohesive properties from self-crosslinking latex particles. The self-crosslinking provided the latex film with excellent tensile strength. The thermal stability was improved after hydrogenation, as indicated by thermogravimetric methods. The activation energy for degradation was determined by Coats-Redfern plots. Hot air oven thermal ageing confirmed that the oxidation resistance increased as the degree of hydrogenation increased. All these results showed that HXNBR latex can form a self-crosslinking film with better mechanical properties, and heat and oxidation resistance than those of XNBR latex film in a wide range of film applications. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Part I focuses on morphology of mixing compounds. The dispersion and distribution of the ZDMA, particles in compound are mainly determined by the viscosity of the compound during mixture processing. For high viscosity matrixes, such as EPDM and NBR, size of ZDMA particles is remarkably fined during mixing, even part of which reaches nano-scale. While for low viscosity matrixes, such as POE, dispersion dimension of ZDMA particle in mixing compound is nearly similar to its original dimension. Such difference of preliminary dispersion structure in compounds must intensely impact on final morphologies and properties of vulcanizates because the in-situ polymerizaiton of ZDMA in compound during vulcanization strongly depends on the dispersed particle size of ZDMA in compound.",

The studies demonstrate that accompanying with the increase in the luminescent of the product the crystallization of the product increases. Therefore, it is proposed that increasing the crystallization of the product will benefit the luminescent performance of the products.",

Transmission elec- tron microscopy showed that the layers of rectorite were well dispersed in the SBR matrix and the aspect ratio (width/thickness) of it was higher than that of montmo- rillonite (MMT). X-ray diffraction indicated that the nano- composite produced by this method was of neither inter- calated type nor exfoliated type. The gas barrier proper- ties and mechanical properties of the novel nanocomposites were excellent. The nanocomposites are expected to be candidates for tire tube or inner materials.

XRD results showed that if OC mixed with EPDM matrix, macromolecule chains are difficult to intercalate into the layers while stearic acid (SA) could easily intercalate into the OC interlayers under pretreating conditions (S-OC) and expand the interlayer spacing 2.6 nm of OC to a wider distance of 3.9 nm; EPDM could not further expand the distance of S-OC during the followed mixing process and the structure SA intercalating into OC is kept. TEM observation showed S-OC improved the dispersion of OC in EPDM, and FT-IR results indicated the esterification reaction occurred between carboxyl groups of SA and hydroxyl groups of OC, which was believed to be the driving force of SA intercalation. The tensile strengths of the nanocomposites are improved with increasing amount of SA, and the stresses at low strain are almost the same, due to the physical interaction between OC and EPDM macromolecules. \u00a9 2006 The Society of Polymer Science, Japan.",

As a result, the absorbing peak in- tensity of organic group on Mg(OH)2 increased with the coat- ing amount of stearic acid increasing and there was no so- called surface saturation as expected. The results indicated stearic acid surface treatment of Mg(OH)2 belonged to the acid-base reaction between stearic acid and Mg(OH)2, and it would not stop until Mg(OH)2 was reacted completely. In addition, stearic acid surface treatment of Mg(OH)2 had remarkable influence on the properties of ethylene vinyl acetate/Mg(OH)2 composites. With the increasing coating amount of stearic acid, the composites had decreased tensile strength, increased elongation at break, and deteriorated flame retardancy, compared with the composites filled with the uncoated Mg(OH)2. However, stearic acid surface treat- ment of Mg(OH)2 benefited processing ability of composites, and the composites had better processing ability as the coat- ing amount of stearic acid increased. 2007 Wiley Periodicals,",

A self-assembled polydopamine (PDA) ad-layer was formed via the oxidative polymerization of dopamine on the surface of CB simply by dipping the CB into an alkaline dopamine solution and mildly stirring at room temperature. The process is simple, controllable, and environment-friendly. The surface composition and structure of the CB were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The surface morphology of the CB was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that the PDA ad-layer was successfully deposited on the CB surfaces. The PDA-functionalized CB (CB-PDA) gave a stable colloidal dispersion in water. Contact angle measurement results indicated that the hydrophilicity of CB was significantly improved after dopamine modification. TGA results confirmed that the modified CB maintained good heat resistance. The method provided a facile route to prepare hydrophilic CB having terminal hydroxyl groups. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The surface of the \u03b1-Fe2O3 particles was first functionalized by polydopamine (PDA), and silver was then plated on the \u03b1-Fe 2O3/PDA surface by electroless plating. The method had the advantage of being simple, nontoxic, controllable, and cost-effective. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to study the crystal structure, surface chemical compositions, and functional groups, respectively, of the hybrid nanoparticles. The results indicated that PDA was successfully deposited on the surfaces of \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanoparticles without affecting their crystal structures. The size and uniformity of the silver nanoparticles could be well controlled by adjusting the concentrations of silver nitrate (AgNO3) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The morphology of the nanoparticles was observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and laser particle size and potential analyzer, respectively. The results showed that the silver nanoparticles were about 8 nm in diameter and uniformly coated on the surface of \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanoparticles. The silver nanoparticles showed good stability on the \u03b1-Fe2O3 substrate even after they were subjected to an ultrasonic experiment for 30 min. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "In this study, conductive composites of methyl vinyl silicone rubber (MVQ) filled with nickel-coated graphite (NCG) were prepared. The effects of the storage time, aging time, stretching, neutral-salt spraying, and acid-salt spraying on the electrical conductivity of NCG/MVQ were investigated. The results indicate that the values of the NCG/MVQ volume resistivity increased a little and were no greater than 0.1 \u00ce\u00a9 cm after long-term storage, thermooxidative aging, stretching, and neutral-salt spraying, respectively; this showed good conductive stability. The volume resistivity rose rapidly under acid-salt spraying; this indicated poor conductive stability. Copyright \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Rubber/organic clay (OC) nanocomposites were produced by melt blending. Polar or unsaturated matrices (e.g., NBR and SBR) could easily enter into OC layers, whereas using nonpolar unsaturated rubber (EPDM), without other additives' help, intercalation structure could not be directly obtained. For the EPDM system, an intercalated structure was observed in presence of stearic acid (SA) for composites composed of SA and OC. Transmission electron microscopy observation showed that the dispersion of clay in nonpolar saturated rubber matrix was much poorer than that in polar or unsaturated matrix. The same effect of polar matrix was confirmed by comparison between IIR/OC and BIIR/OC systems. Moreover, using OC pretreated by SA (S-OC), the dispersion of clay was obviously improved in the investigated nanocompo sites, due to the intercalation of SA into OC interlayers. Especially in the nonpolar saturated EPDM system, the intercalation structure could be easily observed. Relative to the corresponding nanocomposites using OC, tensile strengths and the stresses at low strain of NBR and SBR based nanocomposites with S-OC were significantly improved; while with EPDM nanocomposite, using S-OC, only tensile strengths were improved but the stresses at low strain were almost the same, which should be related to the different interfacial force between OC and different rubber matrices. \u00a9 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Rectorite (REC) powders modified by butadiene-styrene-vinyl pyridine rubber (VPR) were prepared by spray drying, designated as REC-VPRs. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses showed that in the REC-VPRs, VPR did not intercalate into the intergallery of layers. However, compared with REC, the layers of REC-VPRs had more wrinkles and piled loosely. To strengthen the interfacial interaction between VPR and REC, a REC-VPR was treated by volatilized hydrochloric acid, resulting in the formation of ion bonds between REC and VPR, according to Fourier transform infrared spectra measurements. XRD analyses revealed that the intercalated structure emerged in acid treated REC-VPR filled styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR). However, the better dispersion was observed for the SBR composite filled with REC-VPR without acid treatment, indicating that a proper interfacial interaction between REC and VPR is the key to improve the dispersion of REC layers in SBR. Acid treatment did not improve the tensile and tear strengths of the SBR composite filled with REC-VPR. Copyright \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

PA6 fibers were obtained through gel-spinning, drawing, decomplexation, and heat-setting processes. The structure and properties of the fibers at different stages were characterized with differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The experiment results indicate that the melting transition of the as-spun fibers obtained by the extrusion of the PA6/CaCl2/HCOOH solution into a coagulation bath through a die disappeared. A porous structure existed in the as-spun fibers, which led to poor mechanical properties. Compared with the as-spun fibers, the melting and glass-transition temperatures of the decomplexed and drawn fibers retained their original values from PA6, the degree of crystallinity increased, the porous structure disappeared, and the mechanical properties were improved. The maximum modulus and tensile strength obtained from the drawn fibers in this study were 32.3 GPa and 530.5 MPa, respectively, at the maximum draw ratio of 10.

Moreover, a dynamic mechanical thermal analyzer (DMTA) suggested a strong interfacial interaction (interaction parameter B(H) = 4.91) between the silicate layers and macromolecules in addition to the weak inorganic-organic interfacial interaction, and solid state (15)N NMR indicated the formation of a strong ionic interface through the acidifying pyridine. Subsequently, a remarkable improvement of the dispersing morphology, mechanical performance and gas barrier property appeared, compared to that using calcium ion flocculants. This supports the formation of an exfoliated structure and an improved interfacial interaction.",

This was the first time that Tb(Pht)3Phen/rubber (nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) or methyl vinyl silicone rubber (SiR)) composites had been prepared through mechanical mixing processing. SEM revealed that the dimensions of Tb(Pht)3Phen dispersed in matrix rubber were much smaller than those of the original particles of the complex compound. The Tb(Pht)3Phen/rub- ber composites showed much better luminescent perfor- mance than the Tb(Pht)3Phen complex compound. The flu- orescent intensities of the Tb(Pht)3Phen/rubber composites were strongly dependant on the concentration of Tb(Pht)3Phen, and 30 phr was the optimal concentration for both the Tb(Pht)3Phen/NBR and Tb(Pht)3Phen/SiR com- posites. Within the concentration range of Tb(Pht)3Phen used in this work, the fluorescent intensions of the SiR composites were stronger than those of their NBR counter- parts. \u00a9 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "abstract": "Electrostatic discharge (ESD), a universal phenomenon derived from tribocharging and electrostatic induction, has always been regarded as a negative effect because it may cause various types of damage, such as gas explosions, wildfires, failure of integrated circuits, and so on. Normally, ESD is avoided by conducting those harmful charges through the surface or the whole bulk, by means of improving the conductivity of dielectrics or directly using conductive materials. However, the first approach compromises other performances at the same time, whereas the second one can be applied in only a few circumstances. In this Article, we analyzed the working principle of the triboelectric nanogenerator from the perspective of the time variation of the surface-charge-introduced polarization density  , the second term of Maxwell's displacement current. Then, we demonstrated an electrostatic protective system by implanting a conductive layer under the tribocharging surface to form a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). Theoretical derivation, finite element analysis, and experimental results prove that this system can efficiently prevent ESD without sacrificing any other performance. Finally, we applied it to the next generation of the green tire, which can save >10% of fuel but still cannot be commercialized due to the potential ESD risk. This research work reveals a way to prevent ESD and shows great potential in the field of engineering.",

In addition, OSM leads to large processing energy consumption (PEC). In view of these issues, we used a novel method (Two-Step Method, TSM) to investigate the modification process in detail. The TSM modification indicated that the TESPT hydrolyzed firstly to generate the silanol (Si-OH), and the silanol reacted with the hydroxyl groups on the surface of silica, which characterized by FTIR. The properties of modified silica were studied. Furthermore, the SSBR nanocomposites filled with modified silica by TSM and OSM were prepared and the properties comparisons were carried out. The obtained results exhibited the advantages of TSM, and also revealed that 8% TESPT amount was suitable than 12% and 15% TESPT amount. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

The water contact angles of the poly(dopamine) functionalized PI films reduced remarkably in comparison with that of the pristine PI film. The chemical composition and structure of the UV-induced deposited-silver on the modified PI films were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The topography of the modified PI films was investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The deposited poly(dopamine) layer acted as binding sites for the silver ions. The silver-plated PI films showed good antibacterial activity due to that biofilm formation was inhibited on the polymeric surfaces in contact with bacteria.",

Results showed that the PS particles took a spherical shape in the size of 40-60 nm with a narrow size distribution, and the glass-transition temperature of the PS nanoparticles increased with the cross-linking density. The outcomes from the mechanical properties demonstrated that when filled into styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), nitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR), and natural rubber (NR), the cross-linked PS nano-particles exhibited excellent reinforcing capabilities in all the three matrices, and the best in the SBR matrix. In comparison with that of the carbon black filled composites, another distinguished advantage of the cross-linked PS particles filled elastomer composites was found to be light weight in density, which could help to save tremendous amount of energy when put into end products.

The NBR/AO-80 rubber nanocomposites were successfully developed by applying the adopted preparation procedure/conditions, especially by introducing mechanical kneading of the NBR/AO-80 composites at a temperature higher than the melting point of AO-80, followed by the crosslinking of NBR molecules during the subsequent hot-pressing/vulcanization process. The nanocomposites consisted of two phases: (1) the AO-80 enriched phase (nanoparticles with the average size of approximately 20 nm) and (2) the NBR enriched phase (matrix). The generation and uniform distribution of the nanoparticles were attributed to the high temperature mechanical kneading process, the strong intermolecular interactions between AO-80 and NBR molecules, and the formation of a three-dimensional NBR network. The morphological, structural and mechanical properties of the composites were systematically investigated in each preparation step using SEM, TEM, DSC, XRD, FT-IR, DMTA and a tensile tester. The results indicated that the prepared NBR/AO-80 rubber nanocomposites had single relaxation transitions, improved tensile strengths, high dynamic mechanical loss values, and reasonably good stabilities. The NBR/AO-80 rubber nanocomposites are expected to have important applications as a high performance damping material.",

The addition of glycerin or aromatic oil could not change the microstructure of the nanocomposite. FTIR spectra indicated the hydrogen bond interaction between glycerin and rectorite layers. RPA analysis showed that the filler network interaction was reduced by adding glycerin or aromatic oil.

        "title": "Influence of in-situ reaction on luminescent properties of samarium-complex/hydrogenated acrylonitrile-butadiene composites",
        "abstract": "In this work, acrylato(1,10-phenanthroline)bis(2-thenoytrifluoroacetonato) samarium(III) [Sm(TTA) 2 (AA)(Phen)] [Sm-AAPhen; TTA = 4,4,4-trifluoro-1-(2-thienyl)-1,3-butanedione, AA = acrylic acid, Phen = 1,10-phenanthroline] has been synthesized for the first time, which combines the good fluorescence property of Sm(TTA) 3 (Phen) and the reactivity of acrylic acid with radicals. The uncured composites were prepared by adding different amounts of the Sm(TTA) 3 (Phen) complex and a certain amount of peroxide into hydrogenated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (HNBR). The cured composites were prepared by vulcanizing the uncured composites at 160 \u00b0C under a pressure of 15 MPa for 20 min. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra show that the intensity of peaks assigned to reactive C C bond decreases after the curing process, verifying that the in-situ reaction (including polymerization and grafting) of Sm-AAPhen initiated by peroxide radicals took place during the cross-linking of the HNBR matrix. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations show that the dispersion dimension of the cured composite is far finer than that of the uncured composite. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) testing shows that the crystallinity of Sm-AAPhen in the composites was absent dramatically after the curing process, implying that most of crystalline Sm-AAPhen complex took part in the in-situ reaction and formed the non-crystalline poly(Sm-AAPhen). The dispersion phase of cured Sm-AAPhen/HNBR composites is composed of completely almost nanometer-sized poly(Sm-AAPhen) and few residual Sm-AAPhen particles with significantly reduced dimensions. The fluorescent intensity, lifetime and quantum yields of the cured composite are much higher than that of the uncured one with the same Sm-AAPhen content due to the in-situ reaction. Graphical abstract Keywords Fluorescence Polymer In-situ reaction 1 Introduction In recent years, the rare-earth/polymer composites with luminescent properties have been widely studied for the possible applications in display [1] , probes [2,3] , and laser materials [4\u20137] . The organic rare-earth complex can emit strong fluorescence due to its special 4 f electron structure of rare-earth and outstanding absorbing light ability of \u03b2 -diketonate ligand [8\u201310] . The latest activity in the area of luminescent materials has been in developing unique rare-earth/polymer composites having not only the high lighting property but the good processing ability, chemical stability and mechanical strength [11] . Blending is a simple and effective way to get such composites. Zhang RJ et\u00a0al. prepared Langmuir-Blodgett films (one or more monolayers of an organic material on a solid) containing Sm(TTA) 3 Phen (Phen = 1,10-phenanthroline) by using composite sub-phase and found both absorbance and relative fluorescence intensity increased linearly with the number of LB layers [12] . Zhang H et\u00a0al. prepared rare-earth complex/polymer fibers prepared by electrospinning and observed that the thermal stability of photoluminescence in the composite fibers was considerably improved in comparison to the pure complex [13] . However, blending method can hardly achieve the fine dispersion and good interface interaction between the rare-earth complex and polymer matrix, leading the decrease of fluorescent properties of composites. Lin MJ et\u00a0al. recently introduced an approach that combines the rare-earth complex with polymer by the bulk polymerization in an effort to prepare the Sm(OPri)(TTA) 2 /PMMA photoluminescent material which showed a linear structure, and its luminescent strength was as high as that of Sm(TTA) 3 /PMMA [14] . But as a consequence of the limitation of the polymerization caused by the effect of the steric clash resulting from the large dimension of the rare-earth complex, it was found that the lower concentration of Sm(OPri)(TTA) 2 resulted in the lower fluorescent intensity of the material. In our pervious study, we reported a new method of in-situ reaction process which can overcome the poor dispersion and weak interface interaction by blending and subsequent polymerization between the rare-earth complex with little concentration and polymer matrix. The work described the influence of in-situ reaction on the dispersion of rare-earth complex (gadolinium acrylate) and the interaction between them and the polymer matrix (natural rubber). The results illustrated that the self-polymerization of gadolinium acrylate did a good favor both in minishing aggregates of gadolinium acrylate and subsequently improved the X-ray shielding property and in reinforcing resultant composites [15] . This method was further successfully applied in fabricating another novel Eu-AAPhen/NBR composite with excellent fluorescence intensity [16] . In the present work, Sm(TTA) 2 (AA)(Phen)][Sm-AAPhen; TTA = 4,4,4-trifluoro-1-(2-thienyl)-1,3-butanedione,AA = acrylic acid, Phen = 1,10-phenanthroline] was synthesized for the first time, which not only possessed the good fluorescence property for the ligand TTA and Phen whose triplet states could well match the 4 G 5/2 emitting states of Sm 3+ , but also could be initialized by radicals due to the existence of the acrylic acid (AA). Various amounts of this reactive complex were mechanically mixed with hydrogenated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (HNBR) by the similar way as described in Ref. [16] . HNBR was chosen as the polymer matrix because of its strong polarity and high shearing viscosity which helped initial dispersion of the rare-earth complex during filling them into the polymer. Even though HNBR has more degree of saturation compared with nitrile-butadiene used as polymer matrix as described in our previous work, the in-situ reaction is also feasible to occur in the presence of the peroxide in such saturated polymer at high temperature that has been demonstrated by a few reports [17,18] . 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials Samarium oxide (Sm 2 O 3 , 99.99%) was supplied by Shanghai Yue Long Chemicals (China). Hydrogenated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (HNBR, 41 wt% CN, M w \u223c 50 \u00d7 10 4 g mol \u22121 ) was purchased from Bayer Co. 2-Thenoytrifluoroacetonatone (TTA-4,4,4-trifluoro-1-(2-thienyl)-1,3-butanedione), 1,10-phenanthroline (Phen), acrylic acid (AA), and other chemicals are commercial products. 2.2 Synthesis of Sm(TTA) 2 (AA)(Phen) complex Ethanol (30 mL), 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (0.1 mol), and acrylic acid (0.05 mol) were added to a 250 mL side-arm flask. The system was stirred for 20 min and then 1,10-phenanthroline (0.05 mol) and SmCl 3 (0.05 mol) were added to the flask. The reaction mixture was heated and magnetic stirred with the speed of 20 rpm at 60 \u00b0C for 5 h. After that the mixture was cooled to room temperature. Then, triethylamine was added to adjust the pH of the mixture to 5\u20136. Then the precipitate was filtered and washed with ethanol for several times and dried at 80 \u00b0C in a vacuum oven. The product of the complex was characterized by elementary analysis as Sm(TTA) 2 (AA)(Phen). Product yield: 80%. Anal. calcd. C: 44.00%, H: 2.48%, N: 3.31%, Found: C: 43.38%, H: 2.12%, N: 3.12%. 2.3 Preparation of Sm-AAPhen/HNBR composites The composite with 2 wt% Sm-AAPhen content in HNBR matrix was prepared as follows. First, 48 g of the HNBR, 2 g 2,5-dimethyl 2,5-bis ( t -butyl peroxy) hexyne (peroxide D25) and 1.02 g Sm-AAPhen complex were mixed in a mixer (Haake, rheomix 610, Ger.) at 50 \u00b0C with 80 rpm (revolutions per minute) for 15 min to get the compound (uncured composites); then the compound was molded and vulcanized at 160 \u00b0C under a pressure of 15 MPa for 20 min to get the cured composites with a thickness of 1 mm. Other composites with different Sm-AAPhen complex contents (5 wt%, 8 wt%, 12 wt% and 15 wt%) were prepared according to the same procedure. 2.4 Characterization Elemental analysis of the pure Sm-AAPhen complex was carried out by using a Perkin\u2013Elmer 2400 CHN\u2013O Rapid instrument. The Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra of the samples (pure Sm-AAPhen, uncured and cured composites) were recorded at a resolution of 1 cm \u22121 on Bruker Tensor 27 Spectrometer. The X-ray diffraction analysis of the samples was performed by a D/max2500 diffractometer with CuK\u03b1 radiation (40 kV and 20 mA, \u03bb = 0.154 nm). The morphologies of Sm(TTA) 2 (AA)(Phen) and Sm(TTA) 2 (AA)(Phen)/HNBR composites were observed by using scanning electron micrographs (SEM; Cambridge S-250-III, 20 kV.) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Hitachi H-800-1). The fracture surfaces of composites were obtained by breaking the long strip samples in liquid nitrogen. Each sample was covered by gold vapor under vacuum before SEM observation. The thin sections for TEM observation were cut by microtome under \u2212100 \u00b0C and collected on the cooper grids. The fluorescent spectra of the samples were recorded with a Hitachi F-4500 Fluorescent spectrometer equipped with a 450 W Xenon lamp as the excitation source with excitation and emission slit width of 2.5 nm. The fluorescent lifetime of excited state (646 nm) was measured by the steady-state and lifetime spectrofluorometer (FL3-2-IHR221-NIR-TCSPC, HORIBA Jobin Yvon Inc) equipped with an Nd 3+ :YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) pulse laser and excited by 376 nm. The fluorescent yields of the composites were obtained by the integral sphere in the FluoroMax-4 Spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon Inc) and excited by 376 nm. 3 Results and discussion For verifying the in-situ reaction in the curing process of Sm-AAPhen/HNBR composites, the IR spectra (band 1800\u2013650 cm \u22121 ) of Sm-AAPhen/HNBR composites are shown in Fig.\u00a01 . In the spectrum of Sm-AAPhen complex ( Fig.\u00a01 A), the bands at 1641 cm \u22121 are assigned to C O vibration of TTA. The bands at 1517 cm \u22121 are assigned to the C N stretching vibration of Phen. The stretching vibration (COO \u2212 ) peaks of AA appear at 1426 and 1540 cm \u22121 , while the reactive C C stretching vibration peak of AA appears at 1574 cm \u22121 . In the spectrum of uncured composites ( Fig.\u00a01 B), the C C peak of AA can be still observed at 1574 cm \u22121 , although the intensity of peak decreases due to the concentration effect. The bands at 1462 cm \u22121 are assigned to the C\u2013H scissor vibration of HNBR. In the spectrum of cured composites ( Fig.\u00a01 C), the intensity of C\u2013H vibration at 1462 cm \u22121 of HNBR does not change after curing process. However, the band intensity at 1574 cm \u22121 decreases significantly after the curing process, showing the decrease of the content of reactive double bonds. This reveals that most Sm-AAPhen complex have participated in the in-situ reaction in the HNBR matrix during the curing process. In order to further verify the occurrence of the in-situ reaction during the curing process, wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) test is used to prove the structural change of Sm-AAPhen complex in both uncured and cured composites. As shown in Fig.\u00a02 A , the diffraction peaks of the original Sm-AAPhen complex are quite strong, indicating the crystal of Sm-AAPhen complex. In the curve of Fig.\u00a02 B, the broad scattering (2 \u03b8 = 18\u00b0) is likely attributed to the amorphous nature of HNBR matrix, which is shown in Fig.\u00a02 D. The characteristic crystal diffraction of the Sm-AAPhen complex (2 \u03b8 = 23\u00b0 and 33\u00b0) can also be obviously observed in the uncured composite. However, the intensities of these characteristic peaks become lower due to the concentration effect. After curing process, as shown in Fig.\u00a02 C, the characteristic crystal diffraction of the Sm-AAPhen complex almost disappears. It deserves to be noted that the crystal transformation of Sm-AAPhen complex during the curing process can hardly take place, since the curing temperature (160 \u00b0C) is much lower than the melting point of Sm-AAPhen complex (261 \u00b0C). The WAXD results strongly support the fact that most of crystalline Sm-AAPhen complex took part in the in-situ reaction and formed the non-crystalline poly(Sm-AAPhen). Combined the above characterization with our previous basic research on the in-situ reactions [15,16,19] , the chemical reaction mechanism during the curing process is shown in Fig.\u00a03 . The peroxide is firstly decomposed to form radicals by heating, inducing the reaction of the double bonds of the Sm-AAPhen monomer and rubber chains. Consequently, the Sm-AAPhen radicals and the rubber radicals are formed respectively. The former initiates its monomer and gives chain growth of poly(Sm-AAPhen) until the chain radicals are terminated by reaction with other radicals. If they are terminated by other poly(Sm-AAPhen) radicals, the separated poly(Sm-AAPhen) molecules are subsequently formed. If they are terminated by rubber chain radicals, the grafted poly(Sm-AAPhen) with rubber chain obtains. Simultaneously, reactions between rubber chain radicals result in the rubber matrix cross-linking by covalent bonds. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Fig.\u00a04 A shows the morphology of the original Sm-AAPhen particles. The average size of these particles is about 4 \u03bcm with relatively regular shape. There are also some aggregates with the size about 10\u201320 \u03bcm formed by the original Sm-AAPhen particles. In the SEM image of the uncured Sm-AAPhen/HNBR composite ( Fig.\u00a04 B), the light phase represents the dispersed Sm-AAPhen complex particles and/or their aggregates with dimension about 2\u20134 \u03bcm which has been decreased considerably comparing with that of the original Sm-AAPhen complex particles because of the high mechanical shearing and grinding effects during the mixing procedure. After curing, the size of the dispersed particles in HNBR was further decreased and the largest Sm-AAPhen complex particle size is only about 1 \u03bcm ( Fig.\u00a04 C). It indicates significantly that the in-situ reaction has a great effect on improving the Sm-AAPhen complex's dispersion in the curing process. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were conducted to reveal how efficiently the Sm-AAPhen complex particles were dispersed in the composite. A typical image of the composite is depicted in Fig.\u00a05 . The average sizes of Sm-AAPhen complex particles are estimated to be around 200\u2013500 nm, although some big aggregates are seen in Fig.\u00a05 . The statistic size distribution of particles ( Fig.\u00a06 ) shows that the particles with the\u00a0size of 27\u2013104.2 nm accounts for 53.58% of the total particles in the cured composites. It's suggested that such fine dispersion of the particles in the composite resulted from the in-situ reaction [16] . Combining with the analysis of XRD and FTIR data, the poly(Sm-AAPhen) molecules aggregated to form almost nanometer-sized dispersion particles in the curing process. Meantime, the particle size of Sm-AAPhen reduced gradually due to the consumption of substantial Sm-AAPhen molecules during the in-situ reaction process. Therefore, few micrometer-sized particles observed in Fig.\u00a04 C should be the residual of Sm-AAPhen particles. The excitation and emission spectra of the Sm-AAPhen are shown in Fig.\u00a07 . The excitation spectrum ( Fig.\u00a06 A) of the Sm-AAPhen complex shows a broad band covering the entire 200\u2013400 nm regions. The broad excitation band is assigned to the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0* electron transition of the ligands. In the emission spectrum of Sm-AAPhen ( Fig.\u00a07 B), there are three characteristic fluorescence emission bands assigned with Sm 3+ ions, which are the characteristic peaks of the 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H J transitions ( J = 5/2,7/2,9/2) [20] . The peak at 564 nm corresponds to the 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 5/2 transition of Sm 3+ ions, the two peaks at 603 nm and 610 nm correspond to the 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 7/2 transition of Sm 3+ ions, and the strongest peak at 646 nm corresponds to the 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 9/2 hypersensitive transition of Sm 3+ ions. Fig.\u00a08 shows the emission spectra of uncured and cured Sm-AAPhen/HNBR composites with different content of Sm-AAPhen. It can be seen that both cured and uncured composites ( Fig.\u00a08 A and B) possess the similar characteristic emission peaks of original Sm-AAPhen. The fluorescence intensity around 646 nm of uncured and cured composites increases with the growth of Sm-AAPhen content. Additionally, when the emission intensities (646 nm) of the composites are plotted as a function of weight concentration of Sm-AAPhen, as shown in Fig.\u00a08 C, it is obvious to observe that the fluorescent intensities of cured composites are twenty percent higher than that of uncured composites. The photoluminescence quantum efficiencies of the cured and uncured samples containing 15 wt% Sm-AAPhen measured by the integrating sphere method were 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. It indicates that in-situ reaction in the cured composites has effect on improving both the fluorescent intensity and the quantum yields of composites. Combining with the SEM and TEM observations ( Figs. 4 and 5 ), it suggests that the Sm-complex particles are more finely and uniformly dispersed in the cured composites other than the uncured ones, resulting in a much larger surface area of Sm-complex particles in the cured composites with the same content of Sm 3+ . Therefore, such a fine dispersion level would lead to a higher fraction of Sm 3+ in dispersed particles that are easily irradiated by the excitation light and emit fluorescence. Nevertheless, the nonlinear relationship between fluorescent intensity and rare-earth content is also observed in this present work, suggesting the consequence of the negative affection of in-situ reaction on fluorescent emission. As similar to the discussion in our previous work about Eu 3+ [16] , in this work, the formation of aggregates within poly(Sm-AAPhen) particles where rare-earth ions are close together will theoretically lead to more energy transfer between neighboring Sm 3+ centers, which depresses the quantum efficiency of Sm 3+ to some extent. The competition between positive factors and negative ones would finally determine the quantum yields of the cured composites, and the degree of such deviation of the relationship between fluorescent intensity and Sm 3+ content. Obviously, our results show that the positive factors caused by the formation of fine poly(Sm-AAPhen) particles by in-situ reaction are more significant than the negative ones. The fluorescence lifetimes of Sm-AAPhen/HNBR composites were also investigated, as shown in Fig.\u00a09 . The decay curve of the composites can be fitted by bi-exponential functions, revealing there are two chemical microenvironments around Sm 3+ ions [21] . The ratio of two fitted lifetime values ( T 1 / T 2 ) can be applied in showing the asymmetry of two chemical microenvironments around Sm 3+ ions in the composites. It is noteworthy that the T 1 / T 2 value (12.63) of the cured composite is significantly higher than that (7.67) of the uncured composite, indicating the original chemical microenvironments around Sm 3+ ions changed. The site symmetry of Sm 3+ ions became lower in the cured composite resulting from the formation of the poly(Sm-AAPhen) and the chemical interaction occurred between Sm-AAPhen and HNBR matrix during the in-situ reaction. The high asymmetry of chemical microenvironments would sensitize the ability of energy transfer of Sm 3+ ions in the composites and improve the quantum yields of the composites [22\u201325] . 4 Conclusions In this work, we have prepared Sm-AAPhen/HNBR composites with the characteristic Sm 3+ fluorescence and high fluorescent property by the in-situ reaction method. Microstructure characterization and the analysis of fluorescent property of the composite shows the fine dispersion of poly(Sm-AAPhen) particles in the cured composites and chemical interface between the Sm-AAPhen and HNBR matrix, which are the main reasons for the good luminescence of the Sm-AAPhen/HNBR composites. Compared with the uncured composites, the cured composites exhibit high fluorescent intensity, quantum yields and long fluorescent lifetime.

        "abstract": "An infrared spectroscopic method was used to follow the course of in situ polymerization of zinc dimethacrylate (ZDMA) in poly(\u03b1-octylene-co-ethylene) elastomer (POE). The integral intensity of the 831 cm-1 band, ie the out-of-plane deformation mode of =CH, was used to determine the residual amount of ZDMA in composites cured at 165\u00b0C for different times, through which the course of in situ polymerization of ZDMA in POE was traced and the dynamic curve determined. The curing course of the ZDMA/POE/peroxide system at 165\u00b0C was examined with a rheometer and compared with the course of in situ polymerization. The results surprisingly show that the in situ polymerization of ZDMA is almost complete at the beginning stage of curing, and that substantial crosslinking starts subsequently. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy observations on morphologies of ZDMA/POE composites cured at 165\u00b0C for different times were carried out and confirmed the results of infrared experiments. Combining all the investigations, it was deduced that a competition exists between in situ polymerization and crosslinking in the composites. Covalent crosslinking rather than ionic bond crosslinks are the major types of crosslinks structures in ZDMA/POE composites, and its total density is lower than that of carbon-black-reinforced POE. \u00a9 2004 Society of Chemical Industry.",

        "abstract": "Clay/polymer nanocomposites have attracted great interests in the field of materials science and engineering for some superior properties. However, further development is limited by reasons like high price/performance ratio and deficiency in some properties. To break through the bottleneck we have to (1) develop preparation techniques with low cost; (2) exploit the acquired excellent properties and find optimum application fields. In this report, the compositing method using pristine clay and commercialized rubber latex to produce layered silicate/rubber nanocomposites, namely latex compounding method, is introduced. The unique compositing mechanism and structure of the obtained nanocomposites are discussed, and properties of series of clay/rubber nanocomposites prepared by this method are systematically presented. Latex compounding method is a low-cost and easily controlled process, and quite promising to be industrialized. The structure of the nanocomposites is either \"Separated Structure\" or \"Intercalated Structure\". The nanocomposites show desirable properties, such as excellent tensile strength, superior gas barrier property, improved flame retardant property, outstanding anti-fatigue properties, etc. As a result, the first production line of kiloton clay/rubber nanocomposites materials in China was established and ten thousands tons scaled production line is being constructed. The applications of the nanocomposites in tyre inner tube, tyre inner liner, OTR tyre tread and conveyor belts are presented.",

The fluorescence spectra, fluorescence lifetimes, and Judd-Ofelt parameters of the prepared core-sheath fibers were investigated. The results indicated that the Eu(TTA)3phen complex was uniformly dispersed in the silicone rubber as molecular clusters and/or nanoparticles, leading to a high luminescence intensity and efficiency. Additionally, unlike the neat Eu(TTA)3phen complex and electrospun fibers of thermoplastic-based nanocomposites that had no appreciable difference in the fluorescence lifetime and luminescent quantum efficiency at 73 and 293 K, the prepared electrospun core-sheath fibers had a longer fluorescence lifetime and a higher luminescence quantum efficiency at 73 K due to the contribution of the silicone rubber matrix.

TEM images demonstrate that both exfoliated and intercalated nanoscale clay layers co-exist in these nanocomposites, and the aspect ratio of clay layers in S-IIRCN is larger than that in M-IIRCN. XRD patterns reveal that the basal spacing of clay increases from 2.2 nm for the original organically modified silicates to 4.2 nm for those dispersed in the composites, indicating intercalation of some rubber macromolecules into the galleries of clay layers. Compared with corresponding micro-composites and pure IIR vulcanizate, the prepared nanocomposites exhibit outstanding mechanical performances and improved gas barrier properties, which are likely attributed to the nanometer scale dispersion and high aspect ratio of clay layers. In addition, the properties of nanocomposites prepared by solution intercalation are somewhat superior to those of nanocomposites by melt intercalation.

Addition of carbon black had effect of reinforcing, 100% modulus, tensile strength, Shore A hardness and tear strength increased drastically while impact resilience and elongation at break decreased. Addition of plasticizer and CaCO3 decreased mechanical properties, but plasticizer lowered the Shore A hardness.

        "abstract": "It is very important to improve the electrical conductivities of polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) as this can widen their application. In this work, by employing a coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation, we investigated the effect of the amphiphilic diblock copolymer (BCP)-mediated nanoparticle (NP) on the conductive probability of polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) in the quiescent state and under a shear field. The conductive probability of PNCs first increases and then decreases with increasing content of BCPs while, interestingly, it exhibits an N-type dependence on the A-Block-NP interaction. Furthermore, the conductive probability shows a non-monotonic dependence on the fraction of A block (fA) in the BCPs, which reaches the maximum value at moderate fA. Under the shear field, NPs self-assemble to form the sandwich-like structures in the matrix above a critical concentration of BCPs, which leads to the anisotropic conductive probability of PNCs. In addition, the sandwich-like structures of NPs will be broken down at a high shear rate, which reduces the difference of the directional conductive probabilities. Last, the mechanism of the formation of the sandwich-like structures of NPs is discussed. In summary, this work presents a simple method to control the conductive network formation, which can help to design PNCs with high electrical conductivity, and especially anisotropy.",

        "abstract": "A novel method for the preparation of highly conductive silver-plated aluminum (Al) microspheres was demonstrated. The surface of the aluminum microspheres was functionalized by a bioinspired polydopamine (PDA) coating. Electroless plating of silver was then carried out on the functionalized aluminum microspheres. An aqueous solution of silver nitrate is used as silver precursor and glucose is used as reducing reagent. The overall procedure is fast, simple, nontoxic, and controllable. The surface compositions and the crystalline structure of the modified aluminum microspheres were studied by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and x-ray diffraction, respectively. XPS results show that the Al-PDA surfaces were successfully deposited with polydopamine and were ready for electroless deposition of silver. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study the morphology of the Al-Ag bimetallic particles. SEM results show that the silver-plated aluminum core-shell microspheres have a continuous, uniform, and compacted silver layer. The as-prepared Ag/Al particles possess high electrical conductivity. \u00a9 2011 The Electrochemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Brominated isobutyl-isoprene rubber/clay nanocomposite (BIIRCN) and ethylene-propylene-diene-monomer rubber/clay nanocomposite (EPDMCN) were prepared by melt blending. The micro-structural evolution of these two kinds of rubber/clay nanocomposites (RCNs) with vulcanization process was investigated using wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The WAXD results revealed that the intercalated structure of organically modified clay (OMC) changed throughout the whole curing process. The intercalated structure kept on changing beyond the vulcanization stage of T 90. The interlayer space of intercalated silicate in uncured BIIRCN is larger than that in uncured EPDMCN. However, the intercalated structure for EPDMCN changed by a larger extent than that for BIIRCN during the vulcanization process, and the interlayer space of the intercalated structure is larger in the cured EPDMCN than that in the cured BIIRCN. It was found that the intercalant (i.e., octadecylamine, ODA) for OMC could shorten the scorch time of the curing reaction, and increase the curing rate, which was attributed to the further intercalation during vulcanization. TEM results indicated that the spatial distribution of OMC is much better in BIIR (a polar rubber matrix) than that in EPDM (a non-polar rubber matrix). The changes in spatial dispersion structure during vulcanization for EPDMCN and BIIRCN show different trends. In conclusion, the polarity of the rubber is the determining factor influencing the evolution of both the intercalated structure and the spatial dispersion of clay during vulcanization. \u00a9 BME-PT.",

The mechanism of surface modification and reinforcing mechanism of FS were also discussed. It was found that types and amounts of silane coupling agent significantly affect on mechanical properties of FS/rubber composites. By the analysis of IR and NMR, it was indicated that the alkoxyls at one end of silane coupling agent could react with the hydroxyls on the surface of FS to form Si\u2013O\u2013Si bond. And meanwhile the organic functional group at the other end of silane coupling agent could tangle or react with macromolecules. Interestingly, the dispersion of FS and the FS\u2013rubber interfacial bonding were significantly affected by the modification methods, especially what kind of and how much silane coupling agents were used in the modification. Modified FS with Si69 was found out with extraordinary reinforcing effects for SBR, EPDM, NBR and CNBR. According to the observations of TEM and SEM, most of modified FS could be separated into nano-size fibrillar dispersing units under mechanical shear.",

Upon shear force during traditional mechanical mixing, the numerous nano-fibers contained in palygorskite micro-powder were released into rubber matrix resulted from weak stacking force between nano-fibers and high shear stress associated with high viscosity of rubber matrix. Meanwhile these nano-fibers were orientated along the shear direction the same as micro-short fiber. In situ modification using silane coupling agent can improve the dispersion of AT and strengthen the interfacial bonding between AT and rubber. The result from dynamic mechanical thermal analysis shows that the incorporation of palygorskite into rubber matrix markedly lowers the loss factor of rubber in glassy transition region and increases storage modulus of rubber. These nanocomposites exhibit stress-strain characteristics that are similar to that of micro-short fiber reinforced rubber, evident anisotropy in mechanical properties, good processing properties, as well as low cost and easily practiced by industry.",

        "abstract": "MWCNTs reinforced SiR nanocomposites were prepared through a high-shear mechanical mixing technique, using DCP as a curing agent. Under optimum conditions, the MWCNTs can be dispersed homogeneously in the SiR matrix to improve the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites. The mechanical properties of the nanocomposites such as tensile strength, elongation at break, and hardness were evaluated. In addition, the degree of crystallinity and the supercooling were calculated to characterize the crystallization behavior. From DSC study, it has been determined that the degree of crystallinity Xc and the super cooling \u03b4T, generally characterize the crystallization behavior of the nanocomposites. A decrease in Xc and \u03b4T indicate that the crystallization rate of the nanococomposites is increased. After pyrolysis, with the increase of CNT content, the decomposition rate or/and the weight loss of the nanocomposites decreased. The dispersion of carbon nanotubes in silicone rubber was characterized by using SEM. Finally, the effect of carbon nanotubes loading on electrical, thermal conductivity, and the Payne effect was also investigated. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2011.",

The results showed that the tensile strength, elongation at break and permanent set at break of POE decreased greatly after crosslinking. Addition of co-crosslink agent increased the degree of crosslinking and shortened the vulcanization time. Addition of carbon black had the effect of reinforcing, increased the 100% tensile modulus, tear strength, tensile strength and Shore A hardness, decreased the elongation at break and permanent set at break. Addition of plasticizer lowered some mechanical properties, but increased elongation at break and decreased Shore A hardness. When little amount of plasticizer was added, POE showed excellent aging property. A recipe of radiation hose was developed and its properties reached DIN standard.",

        "abstract": "This research on vulcanization illuminates the structure-property relationship of hard rubber with prolonging vulcanization. At the early stage of curing, polysulfur reacts with styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) macromolecules to form chemical crosslink, as evidenced by the significant increase of modulus during vulcaniza- tion. The chemical crosslink is followed by a large amount of interchain attraction, which is due to the modi- fication of SBR macromolecules by combined sulfur. The combined sulfur is formed by the reaction of sulfur atom with SBR backbone, which improves the polarity of SBR macromolecules since sulfur is polar. The influences of chemical crosslink and interchain attraction on the me- chanical properties, thermal properties, dynamic mechan- ical properties, and fracture morphology were ana- lyzed. 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TEM images demonstrate that both exfoliated and intercalated nanoscale clay layers co-exist in these nanocomposites, and the aspect ratio of clay layers in S-IIRCN is larger than that in M-IIRCN. XRD patterns reveal that the basal spacing of clay increases from 2.2 nm for the original organically modified silicates to 4.2 nm for those dispersed in the composites, indicating intercalation of some rubber macromolecules into the galleries of clay layers. Compared with corresponding micro-composites and pure IIR vulcanizate, the prepared nanocomposites exhibit outstanding mechanical performances and improved gas barrier properties, which are likely attributed to the nanometer scale dispersion and high aspect ratio of clay layers. In addition, the properties of nanocomposites prepared by solution intercalation are somewhat superior to those of nanocomposites by melt intercalation. q 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The immobilization of silver nanoparticles on the surface of polymetaphenylene isophthamide (PMIA) fibers was carried out by the functionalization of the PMIA fibers with poly(dopamine), followed by electroless silver plating. The poly(dopamine) (PDA) layer was deposited on the PMIA surface by simply dipping the PMIA substrate into an alkaline dopamine solution. The silver ions can be chemically bound to the catechol and indole functional groups in PDA. The silver ions were reduced into silver nanoparticles by using glucose as the reducing agent, resulting in a distinct silver layer on the PMIA surface. The obtained silver deposit was homogeneous and compact. The chemical composition of the modified PMIA fibers was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and the crystalline structure of the silver-coated PMIA fibers was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). The topography of the modified PMIA fibers was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The four-point probe resistivity meter was used to study the electrical resistivity of the silver-coated PMIA fibers, the results indicated that the electrical resistivity could be as low as 0.61 m\u03a9\u00b7cm, with a controllable silver content, and a satisfactory stability by ultrasonic treatment.",

It was found that different silicon additives had different synergistic ef- fects with Mg(OH)2 on flame retardancy of the EVA matrix and exerted different influences on mechanical properties of the composites. The incorporation of organic montmorillon- ite (MMT) clay or silicone rubber not only made the com- posite reach FH-1 rating in the horizontal fire test and FV-1 rating in the vertical fire test, respectively, but also dramat- ically reduced the peak rate of heat release (Peak RHR) and increased the fire performance index (FPI) and ignition time (IT). The composites filled with precipitated SiO2 exhibited the longest IT, the highest FPI, and FV-1 rating. However, only the composites filled with silicone rubber could attain a balance between mechanical properties and flame retar-",

The crystallization parameters such as the peak temperature (Tp), starting crystallization temperature (T0) and the width of half-height (W1/2\u00b7h) were influenced by the concentration of OIBS. The changes of these parameters demonstrated that with a certain concentration of OIBS, the crystallization temperature of the samples might increase and the uniformity of crystal might improve, which show OIBS has a heterogeneous nucleation during non-isothermal crystallization process of iPP. The kinetics parameters were calculated by the modified Avrami theories of Jeziorny and Mozhishen, respectively. The Zc and F(T) also indicated the crystallization rate could improved by a proper concentration of OIBS.",

        "abstract": "Four representative rubber matrices with varying molecular polarity, such as SBR, NBR, EPDM, and CNBR, were reinforced by mechanical blending with c-(methacryloxy)proxyltrimethoxy silane (KH570) silan- ized natural fibrillar silicate (FS)/unmodified FS when dicumyl peroxide was used as a curing agent. The effects of the loading amount of silane coupling agent KH570 and the type of rubber matrix on the dispersion of FS as well as the FS-rubber interfacial bonding were investi- gated. The mechanical properties of various rubber composites filled with unmodified FS and silanized FS individually were compared. As indicated by SEM and TEM, unmodified FS showed better dispersion in polar CNBR than in nonpolar SBR, whereas the improvement of the dispersion is more for SBR after the silanization of FS, constructing a stronger filler network. Compared with unmodified FS/rubber composites, silanized FS/rubber composites exhibited a higher interphase crosslinking net- work as well as a lower loss factor, indicating the improvement of the FS-rubber interfacial bonding. The more the loading amount of KH570 was, the more the FS- SBR bonding was improved. Similarly, the improvement of the FS-rubber bonding was more evident in nonpolar SBR and EPDM after FS was silanized, causing the more increase in mechanical properties, relative to polar NBR and CNBR. In strong molecular polar rubber such as CNBR and NBR, the strong interfacial bonding was achieved even if FS was not silanized with KH570, so that the composites filled with unmodified FS also possessed good mechanical properties.

The chemical composition of the modified FS surface was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Surface morphological changes of the FS nanofibers were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The results indicated that the in situ spontaneous oxidative polymerization of dopamine on the FS surface and the immobilization of Ag nanoparticles on the surface of FS were successful. The FS-PDA/Ag demonstrated a significant enhancement in antibacterial properties compared to the pristine FS by using Escherichia coli as model strain. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Scan electric microphotograph, rubber processing analyzer and bound rubber testing were also applied to further testify the distribution and dispersion of agglomerates, the filler-filler interactions network and the filler-polymer interactions in the rubber matrix, respectively. The relations between the dynamic mechanical properties and the morphology of the filler in the matrix were discussed. It is shown, from the experimental results, that compared with those of the composite reinforced by untreated silica, the dispersion of the silica and the silica-rubber interaction are both improved by the dispersant and the silane coupling agent, respectively. The better dispersion and the improved bound rubber are responsible for the lower dynamic storage modulus and the better rolling resistance of the rubber composites. A greater improvement in the dynamic mechanical properties of the composites is obtained in the composite treated by the dispersant together with the silane coupling agent. Their effects are additive to some extent.",

Vapor grown carbon nanofiber (VGCF) was then incorporated into BE to prepare BE/VGCF composites by simple melting blending. The uniform dispersion of VGCF and fairly strong interfacial adhesion between BE and VGCF led to a significant improvement in the mechanical properties of the composites. Besides, the incorporation of VGCF successfully converted the insulating BE into electrically conductive composites with a percolation threshold of 2.5. vol.%. The composites showed excellent electroactive shape memory properties, which reached a shape recovery ratio of 97% within 90. s with a direct current voltage of 20. V. The combination of the significantly improved mechanical properties and excellent electroactive shape memory performance of BE/VGCF composites opens up the new opportunity for the electroactive actuator materials in a sustainable manner. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "For styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) compounds filled with the same volume fraction of carbon black (CB), precipitated silica and carbon-silica dual phase filler (CSDPF), filler-rubber interactions were investigated thru bound rubber content (BRC) of the compounds and solid-state 1H low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The results indicated that the BRC of the compound was highly related to the amount of surface area for interaction between filler and rubber, while the solid-state 1H low-field NMR spectroscopy was an effective method to evaluate the intensity of filler-rubber interaction. The silica-filled compound showed the highest BRC, whereas the CB-filled compound had the strongest filler-rubber interfacial interaction, verified by NMR transverse relaxation. The strain sweep measurements of the compounds were conducted thru a rubber process analyzer; the results showed that the CSDPF-filled compound presented the lowest Payne effect, which is mainly related to the weakened filler network structure in polymer matrix. The temperature sweep measurement, tested by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, indicated that the glass transition temperature did not change when SBR was filled with different fillers, whereas the storage modulus in rubbery state and the tan\u03b4 peak height were greatly affected by the filler network structure of composites. \u00a9 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

        "abstract": "Graphene oxide was directly reduced into graphene in N-methyl-pyrrolidone with the assisted-dispersion of vapor grown carbon nanofibers (VGCF), resulting in a homogeneous dispersion of VGCF-graphene hybrid filler (VGCF-G). In the hybrid filler, VGCF served as effective stabilizers for graphene by adsorbing VGCF onto graphene through \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction. Subsequently, the as-prepared VGCF-G was incorporated into a bio-based polyester (BE) to prepare BE/VGCF-G composites by solution blending. In the composites, graphene was complete exfoliated with the assisted-dispersion of VGCF. Simultaneously, graphene acted as \"compatibilizer\" to improve the dispersion of VGCF and enhance the interfacial adhesions. As a consequence, the binary combination of VGCF and graphene showed remarkable synergistic effects in improving the electrical conductivity and mechanical properties of the BE/VGCF-G composites. For example, at the filler content of 4.8 vol%, the electrical conductivity of BE/VGCF-G composite is about 4 orders of magnitude higher than BE/VGCF composite containing VGCF alone, and the ultimate stress and modulus of BE/VGCF-G composite is 58% and 45% higher than those for BE/VGCF composite. Furthermore, multi-stimuli responsive shape memory performances (electro-activated and infrared-triggered) of the composites were investigated. BE/VGCF-G composites showed a combination of higher shape memory recovery, stronger recovery stress and faster response, compared with BE/VGCF composites. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The modifiers were prepared at a solid content of 50 wt% by a seeded emulsion polymerization. Dynamic light scattering measurement showed that the particle grew without significant secondary nucleation occurring. The morphology was confirmed by means of transmission electron microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the morphology of the fractured surfaces. The dynamic mechanical analysis measurements indicated that the appearance of two merged transition peaks and the magnitude of the loss peak of PA 6 matrix with the addition of PBMA core-shell modifier in the PA 6/PBMA blends were responsible for the improvement of PA 6 toughness.

In analysing the relationship between polymer loading and modified asphalt properties, we found that the ductility of polymer modified asphalt measured at 5\u00b0C exhibited a percolation phenomenon, that is, as the loading of polymer exceeded a critical value, the ductility of modified asphalt changed abruptly. Furthermore, a percolation threshold differential existed. A rubber processing analyser, an optical microscope and a fluorescence microscope were used to characterise the microstructure of polymer modified asphalt and validate the occurrence of a polymer network in modified asphalt as a function of polymer loading. The percolation phenomenon of polymer modified asphalt was found to be associated with the polymer network in modified asphalt and can be well explained by the percolation mechanism of rubber toughened plastics. \u00a9 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining 2013.",

The results showed that the dynamic storage modulus (E\u2032_0) at small strain amplitude (\u22640.70%) and low frequency (1 Hz) could be used to evaluate the dispersion characteristics of PDMS filled with nano-SiO_2 composites. E\u2032_0 increased with increasing thermal annealing time and the activation energy was calculated as 3.01 kJ/mol for PDMS/SiO_2(mass ratio 100/100). The agglomeration of nano-silica aggregated, bound rubber content increased and reached equilibrium with increasing thermal annealing time. E\u2032_0 of PDMS filled with modified nano-SiO_2 increased slightly at the beginning of the thermal annealing and almost kept constant after that.",

Characterizations by UV-vis, photoluminescence and Raman, the graphene-RhB interactions are shown to be cation-\u03c0 and \u03c0-\u03c0. Subsequently, the obtained graphene is incorporated into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to fabricate PVA/graphene composites by simple solution casting. On addition of 1.0 wt% graphene, the tensile strength and tensile modulus are increased by 178% and 139%, respectively. Interestingly, the strain of the composites is greatly maintained, which is related to the uniqueness interfacial structure and morphology of the composites. This work provides a promising methodology to fabricate high performance graphene-based composites with superior strength and ductility by simultaneously combining the reinforcement of graphene sheets and the uniqueness interfacial structure. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Stretching orientation and strain-induced crystallization of rubber is widely recognized to play key role in the self-reinforcement of natural rubber and some synthetic rubbers(such as chloroprene rubber,butyl rubber and hydrogenated nitrile-butadiene rubber).Therefore,studying these phenomena and behavior has substantial significance for understanding the mechanism of the rubber reinforcing.In this review,various characterization methods concerning stretching orientation and strain-induced crystallization of polymer materials as well as principles,features and applicable scope of these methods were summarized and compared.Current progresses in the research about stretching orientation and strain-induced crystallization of nano-fillers(including carbon black,silica,nano clay and carbon nanotube) reinforced rubber composites as well as thermoplastic elastomers were surveyed.Finally,the future developing trend in this research field was prospected.",

        "title": "Cytotoxicity of elastomer biological material thermoplastics starch",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The strength and elasticity of general starch can be enhanced dramatically after plastic blends. The major characters of this material are magnitude molecular weight, many enwinded points, extreme containment of small molecules, and great gelation ability. It can be used as a biodegradable replacement of alginate. Furthermore, by adding osteoinductive factors, thermoplastics starch (TP) can be used as an organic engineering material, which can provide dual functions: anti-bleeding and bone formation. TP can also be used as intraoral tissue formation membrane and burn dressings. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the bio-safety of TP through a cytotoxicity test. DESIGN: A controlled observation. SETTING: Beijing Research Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedics; Beijing Jishuitan Hospital; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; Peking Univesity School of Stomatology. MATERIALS: The experiment was conducted at the laboratory of Beijing Research Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedics from April to October in 2006. TP sample was obtained by plasticization of corn starch (12 wt % water content) with glycerol in a Haake Rheomix at 110\u2103 and with 80 rounds per minute for 25 minutes, elongation at break from 115.3% to 245.3%. It was prepared by Beijing Key Laboratory for Preparation and Processing of Novel Polymeric Materials, Beijing University of Chemical Technology. Mouse fibroblast L-929 cell strain was provided by the cell bank of Peking University Health Science Center. METHODS: 1\u00d7107 L-1 cell aqueous suspension was cultured into leaching liquor ( 50% ), serving for TP group, and routine culture medium served for negative control group. Effect of TP on relative growth rate of L-929 cell strain was quantitatively measured by MTT assay. The cytotoxicity of TP was evaluated according to GB/T16175-1996. Morphological changes and proliferation of cells were observed after2, 4, and 7 days of culture in the medium through an inverted phase contrast microscope. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cytotoxicity, morphological changes and proliferation of cells, and cell relative growth rate. RESULTS: Cytotoxicity: After 2 and 4 days of incubation, the absorbance (A) value was lower in the TP group than in the negative control group. After 7 days of incubation, the A value was significantly higher compared to negative control group (P < 0.01). It indicated that after 2 and 4 days of incubation, the cytotoxicity in the TP group was larger than in the negative control group, while after 7 days of incubation, it was on the opposite. All the test time, TP's cytotoxicity grade ranged from 0 to 1. Morphological change and proliferation of cells: After 2 days of incubation, both groups of cells were not extended to the outside of the scope, with a majority shape of being round, triangle, and quadrangle in the TP group or fusiform cells in the negative control respectively. Four days later, there were gaps among cells in the TP group, while in the negative control group, there were hardly any distance between cells and some cells piled up. Seven days later, cells in starch medium suddenly grew up to such a degree that all the cells lapped over and presented with more bloom than the negative control. Cell relative growth rate: After 2, 4, and 7 days of incubation, relative growth rate increased with time, being 85.63%, 82.22%, and 113.05%, respectively. CONCLUSION: TP has no evidence of cytotoxicity and has good bio-safety.",

The effects of the size of the small gases and the co-monomer content on diffusion of gases and the changes of free volume are discussed. The whole simulations were processed under Compass force field. The calculated densities refined by NPT ensemble simulationa are in good agreement with the experimental data. The diffusion coefficients were determined by NVT ensemble simulation in 500 ps. After molecular dynamic simulation, the trajectories of the small molecules in the polymer matrix were obtained. Then the diffusion coefficients were calculated from the Einstein relation. The results show that the diffusion coefficients of oxygen and hydrogen increase with the content of 1-hexene, which agrees with the analysis of the interaction between the copolymer chains. It is concluded that molecular dynamics simulation is an effective method to predict the gas diffusion coefficient of small molecules in olefin copolymers.",

Polymerizations of the monomers 1-4 were carried out with (nbd)Rh +[\u03b7 6-C 6H 5B -(C 6H 5) 3] as catalyst in CHCl3 yielding the polymers with number-average molecular weights of 1300-22400. Poly(1a)-poly(3a) and poly(4) were characterized by UV and CD spectroscopy. Poly(1a)- poly(3a) showed an intense positive CD signal at 325 nm based on the conjugated polyacetylene backbone while poly(4) showed no peak there, indicating that the polymers had a helical structure with predominantly one-handed screw sense because of P-chiral centre sole contribution.",

        "abstract": "Ethylene-Propylene-Diene Monomer/Polypropylene thermoplastic vulcanizates (EPDM/PP TPVs) have been widely used as a kind of typical \"green\" elastomer because of their excellent mechanical properties and recyclability. The industrial TPVs always contain various types of additives, which influence the viscosity ratio of EPDM and PP and the morphology of TPVs. This work studied the morphology evolution of EPDM/PP TPVs with various amounts of curing agents, fillers, and plasticizer during dynamic vulcanization in a twin-screw extruder, which provides much more complicated dynamic vulcanization process than haaker rheometer. The results show that the increased curing agents content leads to the faster morphology evolution of TPV because it enhances the cross-linking speed and the viscosity of EPDM. The increased fillers content leads to the later breakup of EPDM and the bigger size of the rubber aggregation because it enhanced the modulus of EPDM and weakens the interfacial interaction between EPDM and PP. In addition, the increase in the plasticizer content leads to the earlier breakup of EPDM and the larger size of the rubber phase in TPV. Our work firstly demonstrates the morphology evolution of industrial EPDM/PP TPV, and thus can provide a guidence for the industrial production of high-performance EPDM/PP TPVs. \u00a9 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

The PPSe/BM composites kept excellent shape memory properties as previously reported PPSe. Compared to neat PPSe, the composites possess much higher mechanical properties above the melting point and faster biodegradation rate, which was demonstrated via tensile test at elevated temperature and in vitro degradation experiments in phosphate buffer saline (PBS), respectively. The obviously improved mechanical properties at elevated temperature are attributed to the uniform dispersion of the reinforcing boehmite nanoplatelets, which was facilitated by the interfacial interaction between BM and PPSe as revealed by FTIR, XPS, and XRD results. The faster degradation is correlated to accelerated hydrolysis by basic boehmite with surface aluminols. The potential biocompatibility, as substantiated by the outstanding cell viability and cell attachment, together with the realization of transformation temperature close to body temperature makes the PPSe/BM composites suitable for the biomedical applications, such as stents, in human body.",

We concluded that the vulcanized NBR particles in TPVs act as heterogeneous nucleation centers and increase the number of nuclei. The crystallization rate of PP thereby increases and the growth of PP spherulites is restrained because of the isolation of vulcanized NBR particles. Since the addition of compatibilizer improves the compatibility of NBR and PP, the smaller and uniformly dispersed NBR particles are obtained, resulting in more and smaller PP crystals as well as higher crystallization rate, compared with Ultra-fine fully vulcanized NBR particles (UFNBR)/PP TPVand NBR/PP TPV without compatibilization. The isothermal crystallization kinetics of PP in TPVs obeys the Avrami equation, whereas the nonisothermal crystallization kinetics is well described by the equation of Mo et al. \u00a9 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

In the present work, the elastomeric hybrids consisting of GO sheets are fabricated by utilizing butadiene-styrene-vinyl pyridine rubber (VPR) as the host through co-coagulation process and in situ formation of an ionic bonding interface. The VPR/GO composites with a normal hydrogen bonding interface are also prepared. The mechanical properties and gas permeability of these hybrids with an ionic bonding interface are obviously superior to those of the composites with a hydrogen bonding interface. With the ionic interfacial bonding, inclusion of 3.6 vol% of GO in VPR generates a 21-fold increase in glassy modulus, 7.5-fold increase in rubbery modulus, and 3.5-fold increase in tensile strength. The very fine dispersion of GO and the strong ionic interface in the hybrids are responsible for such unprecedented reinforcing efficiency of GO towards VPR. This work contributes new insights on the preparation of GO-based polymer hybrids with high performance. \u00a9 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "The influence of in situ modification of silica with bis-(3- (triethoxysilyl)-propyl)-tetrasulfide (TESPT) on filler network in silica filled solution SBR compound was investigated. In situ modification greatly increased the bound rubber content. TEM observation of silica gel showed that bridging and interlocking of absorbed chains on the surface of silica particles formed the filler network. Rubber processing analyzer (RPA) was used to characterize the filler network and interaction between silica and rubber by strain and temperature sweeps. In situ modification improved the dispersion of silica, and in the meantime, the chemical bonds were formed between silica and rubber, which conferred the stability of silica dispersion during the processing. Compared to the compound without in situ modification, the compound with in situ modification of silica exhibited higher tan \u03b4 at low strains and lower tan \u03b4 at high strains, which can be explained in terms of filler network in the compounds. After in situ modification, DMTA results showed silica-filled SSBR vulcanizate exhibited higher tan S in the temperature range of -30 to 10\u00b0C, and RPA results showed that it had lower tan \u03b4 at 60\u00b0C when the strain was more than 3%. \u00a92007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "The breakup of the rubber phase in an ethylene-propylene-diene monomer (EPDM)/polypropylene (PP) blend at the early stage of dynamic vulcanization is similar to that in an unvulcanized EPDM/PP blend because of the low crosslink density of the EPDM phase. In this work, the minimum size of the rubber phase in the unvulcanized EPDM/PP blend was first calculated by using the critical breakup law of viscoelastic droplets in a matrix. The calculated results showed that the minimum size of the rubber phase in the unvulcanized blend was in the nanometer scale (25-46 nm), not the micrometer scale as reported in many works. Meanwhile, the actual size of the rubber phase in the thermoplastic vulcanizate (TPV) at both the early stage and the final stage of dynamic vulcanization was observed by using peak force tapping atomic force microscopy (PF-AFM). The results indicated that the EPDM phase indeed broke up into nanoparticles at the early stage of dynamic vulcanization, in good agreement with the calculated results. More interestingly, we first revealed that the micrometer-sized rubber particles commonly observed in TPV were actually the agglomerates of rubber nanoparticles with diameters between 40 and 60 nm. The mechanism for the formation of rubber nanoparticles and their agglomerates during dynamic vulcanization was then discussed. Our work provides guidance to control the microstructure of the rubber phase in TPV to prepare high performance TPV products for a wide range of applications in the automobile and electronic industries.",

        "title": "Effects of interfacial interaction on chain dynamics of rubber/graphene oxide hybrids: A dielectric relaxation spectroscopy study",
        "abstract": "Hybrids consisting of graphene oxide (GO) sheets and butadiene-styrene- vinyl pyridine rubber (VPR) were prepared by a co-coagulation process with different flocculants, hydrogen chloride and calcium chloride, in order to form two kinds of bonding interfaces, namely ionic bonding (HVPR) and hydrogen bonding (CaVPR) interfaces. To reveal the effects of interfacial interaction on the chain dynamics, the dielectric relaxation spectra of these hybrids have been investigated. The results show that all hybrids exhibit two distinct relaxation processes, segmental relaxation and interfacial relaxation. The concentration of GO has no impact on the segmental dynamics of CaVPR, but the segmental dynamics of HVPR slow down at 1.5 vol% of GO. Meanwhile, the segmental relaxation of HVPR is always a little faster than its CaVPR counterpart. In the temperature range of 5-35\u00b0C, a new relaxation mode, which is slower than the segmental relaxation and attributed to the interphase with restricted chain dynamics, has been observed for all the hybrids with a GO loading lower than 2.5 vol%. The interfacial relaxation time of HVPR decreases with decreasing GO concentration. However, in CaVPR it first decreases and then increases with decreasing GO concentration. Most interestingly, the interfacial relaxation of HVPR is slower than that for CaVPR. The dielectric strength (\u0394\u03b5), the calculated fragility parameter and the effective activation enthalpy of the interfacial chains in HVPR are always higher than those in CaVPR with the same GO concentration. All the evidence indicates the stronger interfacial interactions in HVPR than in CaVPR. This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.",

Based on Halpin-Tsai equation, the average length and orientation factor fp were introduced into it to consider the effect of short fiber length distribution and orientation on the longitudinal young's modulus of composites. A new way which expressed the effect of orientation on the longitudinal young's modulus by means of fp modifying \u03be\u03b8 was put forward: \u03be\u03b8 =Ld-1 (fp+1). The results show that the predicted values of longitudinal young's modulus fit the experimental data well. To the prediction of transverse young's modulus of composites, the effect of orientation of short fiber on modulus was considered through \u03be=2+Kvf where K was constant which varied depending on different composites.

        "abstract": "A novel method for producing graphene/hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) composite with a fine dispersion of graphene is established. The thermoresponsive HPC, with low a critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior, becomes self-associated into nanospheres when its homogeneous solution is heated to a temperature higher than the LCST. The formed nanospheres of HPC can then \"clamp\" graphene layers and get them finely dispersed in solution and in the polymer matrix. Incorporating graphene via this method can largely prevent graphene from agglomeration. Compared with the conventional casting method, the proposed LCST method can further enhance the electrical conductivity of HPC/graphene composites by 2-3 orders of magnitude. The percolation threshold value of RGO loading is as low as 0.11 vol%. Graphene layers are \"sandwiched\" into the nanospheres of hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) during its conformational transition. Via this method, the dispersion of graphene is manipulated well and the electrical conductivity of the HPC/graphene composites is enhanced further by 2-3 orders of magnitude, compared with the casting method.

The results showed that the elasticity was improved with increasing the crosslinking density of rubber and the crystallinity of polypropylene. Adding 10%-20% (mass fraction) of chlorinated paraffin and dibutyl tin laurate could decrease compression set of TPV evidently. With increasing the ratio of rubber to plastic, the elasticity of TPV also meliorated. It was found that the compress temperature affected the elasticity of TPV markedly. With raising the compress temperature, the compression set increased notably. At high compress temperature, the viscidity of rubber phase increased, the elasticity of TPV decreased. The movement of the molecular chain of polypropylene was enhanced and some molecular chain shifted.",

SEM and TEM prove that the majority of AO-80 dissolve in the NBR/PVC matrix and the remnants AO-80 in the submicro-size particles distribute in the matrix. The DSC and XRD results illustrate that AO-80 in the matrix exists in an amorphous form. The results of DSC and DMTA prove that strong intermolecular interactions are formed between AO-80 and NBR/PVC matrix. All the AO-80/NBR/PVC crosslinking composites have only one tan\u03b4 peak, which displays the excellent compatibility between the AO-80 and the NBR/PVC matrix. More importantly, the tan\u03b4 peaks of the crosslinking composites shift to the higher temperature with increasing of the AO-80 amount in the composites, and the tan\u03b4 value of the crosslinking composites obviously synchronously increases. The chemical crosslinking of the composites results in considerable tensile strength. The high damping and mechanical properties endow the composites with a potential and promising application future in engineering.",

It was the first time to find this phenomenon that after some parts of carbon black were replaced by ternary-nylon-copolymer (nylon6/66/1010=20/10/70), the mechanical properties of this compound vulcanized by peroxide, especially hot tear could be improved magnificently, while the composite kept its striking heat resistance property. SEM shows that disperse particles can be changed into micro-fibers through some special treatment. Micro-fibers are disorderly oriented in one plane, which is vertical to the direction of vulcanization's tension. Only a few micro-fibers become irregular through vulcanizing. Physical test reveals that elongations at break along the lengthways direction are larger than elongations at break along the vertical direction, which is contradictory to the law of short fiber rubber composite.

The percent conversion and the particle size of composite latexes were measured by gravimetric analysis and the Dynamic Light Scattering online. The results show that the instantaneous conversions are higher than 90% and the overall conversions are over 98%. The z-average particle sizes are the same for the three kinds of composite latexes with different core components. The emulsion was coated onto the PET film to measure the adhesive properties (tack force, peel strength and shear resistance) according to FINAT testing methods. The thermal properties of pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) were determined by thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) and the mechanical properties of PSAs were characterized by Dynamic Mechanical Analysis. The results show that embedding nanosilica into acrylic matrix is favorable to improve the thermal property and increase the shear resistance while keeping the relative high values of tack force and peel strength.",

Transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the REC layers presented a nanodispersion structure in the REC/ENR compound. The vulcanization characteristics indicated that ENR increased the crosslinking density of the composites. The stronger reaction between the REC layers and ENR was verified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in the spray-dried REC/ENR compound blended with NR versus that in the REC/NR master batch blended with ENR. As a result, the physical properties, such as the mechanical properties, cutting and chipping resistance, and abrasion resistance, of the composites were greatly increased by the addition of the REC/ENR compound.

In order to solve the modeling problem of the representative volume element (RVE) with any volume fraction and specified spatial configuration, the strategy to describe the objective spatial distribution configuration by the spatial distribution potential-energy function was employed, and a Monte Carlo controllable spatial distribution algorithm was designed, which can effectively create the RVE containing cluster and network configurations with any volume fraction. The simulated results show that, at the same volume fraction, the network configuration is easier to form the thermal conductive pathways and features higher thermal conductivity than the cluster one does; the volume fraction plays a key role in the formation of the effective thermal conductive pathways, which can occur only when the volume fraction is larger than 20% and the distance between the particles is short to some extent; with the increasing distance between the particles, the thermal conduction decreases in an exponent form. Therefore, a given amount of volume fraction and relative effective distribution of particles become two essential conditions of the formation of the effective thermal conductive pathways.",

The influence of cure method on microdispersion of rubber/clay nanocomposites was studied.The results showed that the original intercalated structure of rubber/clay nanocomposites was not stable in the conditions of high temperature and pressure; the intercalated structures and their spatial distributions in the matrix were extensively altered by the pressing treatment. The effect of pressure during the cure on microstructure of rubber/clay nanocomposites was investigated by transmission electron microscopy(TEM) and wide angle X-ray diffraction(WAXD). The results revealed that the clay dispersion state in isobutylene-isoprene rubber/clay nanocomposites and styrene-butadiene rubber/clay nanocomposites were different at mould pressure and atmospheric pressure cure. Finally, obviating pressure effect, the desirable morphology structure of the dispersed silicate layers could be obtained by atmospheric pressure cure.",

The effects of APP, PER,melamine(MEL) and their synergistic agents zinc borate(ZB), organic montmorillonite(OMMT) on the properties of EPDM/PP thermoplastic vulcanizate(TPV) were studied. The results showed that EPDM/PP blends could not be vulcanized when APP or PER was added before dynamic vulcanization. The comprehensive mechanical properties were good while 30 phr APP was added. The flame retardant property raised, but the tensile strength decreased with increasing amounts of APP, PER and MEL.The optimum amounts of APP,PER,MEL were 30,10,10 phr respectively. The apparent viscosity of TPV filled with 30 phr APP,10 phr PER and 10 phr MEL was similar to EPDM/PP TPV without flame retardant.The tensile strength of the system decreased while ZB or OMMT was added, and the flame retardant effect of OMMT was better than that of ZB. The apparent viscosity of OMMT system declined at lower shear rate, but raised at higher shear rate. To ZB system,the apparent viscosity had no change at lower shear rate and the viscosity raised at higher shear rate.",

The instantaneous conversion is higher than 85% and overall conversion is over 95%. Comparison of theoretically calculated particle diameters with those measured experimentally show that the particles have grown without significant secondary nucleation occurring. The TEM analysis verified the morphology and the particle size. When it was used to modify PVC matrix, the PVC/ACR blend occurres brittle-ductile transition with the addition of 3 phr ACR. The Charpy impact strength reaches 16.51 kJ/m2, while the tensile keeps a relative high value (61.37 MPa). The SEM observation was used to explain the toughening mechanism. The ACR modifier is dispersed homogeneously in the PVC matrix, and the fractured surfaces show the networked structure and ductile deformation. The particle with approximately 180 nm of rubber-phase yields the effective impact absorption while minimizing the loss of tensile properties. This result will be used in the industrial scale in the nearest future.",

For the first time, the morphology was got by diluting the IIR/PP TPV using PP. The results showed that, the effect of oil on the flow property was very notable, oil could greatly improve the flow property of TPV, but the effect of silica on TPV mechanical properties was not evident. Based on this study, the new mechanism and idea for the effect of oil on flow property was brought forward, which was, during dynamic vulcanization, the crushing efficiency of rubber was enhanced by adding softening agent. At the same time, there was some oil migrated into PP, as the result, the viscosity of matrix decreased. It was because of above two efficiencies that the flow property of TPV was improved.",

In this work, a kind of bio-based polyester (BE) is synthesized by polycondensation between plant-derived diols and diacids. It is then grafted onto graphene oxide (GO) via the easterification between hydroxyls of BE and carboxyls of GO. Subsequently, the grafted GO is subjected to reduce by vitamin C. Because of the presence of terminal hydroxyl group in both ends of the BE chains and multiple carboxyl groups on GO, the grafts form specific spatial interconnection structure in BE matrix. The resulting BE/graphene composites possess impressive low threshold percolation of electrical conductivity, in combination of high thermal conductivity. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "An efficient and economical process utilized oligo-\u03b2-cyclodextrin substituted agarose gel medium has been developed for paclitaxel recovery and purification directly from the plant materials of Taxus cuspidata . The process is a combination of extraction, alkaline Al 2 O 3 chromatography step, oligo-\u03b2-cyclodextrin substituted agarose gel column chromatography which employed a novel oligo-\u03b2-cyclodextrin-Sepharose HP as the packing material, and crystallization. The Al 2 O 3 normal-phase chromatography was used to obtain a preliminary isolation of paclitaxel from largely unwanted compounds in crude extract. The highest selectivity for paclitaxel was obtained on the oligo-\u03b2-cyclodextrin-Sepharose HP column compared with other \u03b2-cyclodextrin coupled gel media columns. The initial separation extract on Al 2 O 3 column was purified by the subsequent oligo-\u03b2-cyclodextrin-Sepharose HP column chromatography with a purity of about 95.3% and a recovery of 87.1% under the optimum mobile phase composed of methanol/acetonitrile/water = 32/20/48 (v/v/v). One-step crystallization can increase the product purity up to 97.3%. HPLC analysis and ESI-MS/MS spectrum were used for the detection and characterization of paclitaxel in isolated fraction.

Silver nanoparticles can be deposited on the surface of the PI grafted with VBVN film through photo-induced reduction of the silver ions in salt solution. The surface compositions of the modified PI films were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The topography of the electroless deposited PI films was characterized by SEM and AFM. The results show that the silver nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the surface of PI films, and the size and distribution of the nanoparticles can be varied by changing the UV irradiation time.",

The result verifies that the total conversion of the monomers exceeds 98%. On the assumption that the latex particles present and grow in the shape of sphere, the theoretical particle diameter of the latexes is consistent with the actually measured value; the fact reveals that there exists no significant secondary nucleation in the polymerization system. As the mass ratio of core to shell monomer rises, no obvious variation in glass transition temperature (T g) of the low temperature zone [poly(n-butyl acrylate) zone] appears while a declining trend in T g of high temperature zone (polystyrene zone) occurs. This phenomenon demonstrates the existence of the transition layer formed on the interface of the core-shell structure. When blending the emulsion polymer with polystyrene (PS), the impact strength of the blending increases at first and decreases with that as the mass ratio of core to shell monomer augments, that means there are optimum conditions suitable for toughening PS with the core-shell structured polymer.",

        "abstract": "In this study, the morphologies of three types of acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR)/polypropylene (PP) thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) (with an NBR/PP blend ratio of 70/30) were compared. The TPVs were (1) an ultrafine fully vulcanized acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (UFNBR)/PP TPV made by the mechanical blending of UFNBR with PP, (2) a dynamically vulcanized NBR/PP TPV without the compatibilization of maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MP) and amine-terminated butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymer (ATBN), and (3) a dynamically vulcanized NBR/PP TPVs with the compatibilization of MP and ATBN. The influence of the compatibility therein on the size of the dispersed vulcanized NBR particles and the crystallization behavior of the PP in the TPVs and the resultant properties are also discussed. As indicated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, polarizing microscopy, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, and rheological and mechanical testing, the compatibility was significantly improved by the reactive compatibilization of MP and ATBN, which led to a uniform and fine morphology. The compatibilization increased the crystallization rate and reduced the size of the spherulites of PP. On the other hand, it was found that the dispersed vulcanized NBR particles lowered the degree of crystallinity. The better the compatibility of the blend was, the lower the degree of crystallinity and the storage modulus were, but the higher the loss factor and the processing viscosity were. All TPVs showed almost the same oil resistance, but the TPV prepared with reactive compatibilization had the best mechanical properties. \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The latexes were prepared at a solid content of 50% by a two-stage sequential emulsion polymerization with the monomers n-butyl acrylate (BA) and acrylic acid (AA). Dynamic light scattering was used to monitor the particle diameters and showed that the particles grew without significant secondary nucleation occurring. The molecular parameters were characterized by gel permeation chromatography and dynamic mechanical analysis. The adhesive properties measured were loop tack force, peel strength and shear resistance according to FINAT test methods. The relationship between pressure-sensitive properties and molecular parameters, such as gel content and molecular weight, was evaluated.",

The viscosity of the rubber powder modified asphalt mixed with the viscosity reducer was traced by Brookfield asphalt viscometer. The softening point,penetration and ductility was tested. The principle of viscosity-reducing was characterized by the 4 components of asphalt. The results showed that the viscosity of rubber modified asphalt could be greatly reduced by octadecanamide so that the processing temperature could be lower. And the performance indexes was influenced a little. Viscosity-reducing and performance index arrived at the best balance at 135\u2103.",

        "abstract": "Five different types of organically modified montmorillonites (OMMT), including Nanomor\u00ae I.30P, I.44P, I.24TL, I.34TCN, and I.31PS, were incorporated into silicone rubber (SiR), respectively, by using a melt-blending method. The intercalation structure and spatial dispersion of OMMT in the obtained composites were characterized with wide-angle X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The results revealed that the high-polar organic intercalants or silane-coupling agent might play the negative roles in the melt intercalation of SiR into OMMT, and the higher the initial interlayer spacing of the OMMT, the easier the intercalation. The intercalated structure in the SiR/I.44P OMMT nanocomposite has the largest interlayer spacing, and the spatial dispersion of OMMT is also the best. When OMMT loading is low (i.e., less than 10 phr), the dispersion of OMMT is poor. The dispersion of OMMT improves with increasing OMMT dosage, when the loading does not exceed 30 phr. The gas barrier property and the mechanical properties of the SiR are obviously improved by the incorporation of OMMT. The nitrogen gas permeability coefficient of the SiR nanocomposite containing 30 phr OMMT (I.44P) is lower than that of net SiR by 31%. To further improve the dispersion of OMMT in SiR, 20 phr fumed silica (FS) was added to the compound before mixing OMMT for increasing viscosity of the compound and mechanical shearing force during compounding OMMT. The resultant SiR/OMMT/FS ternary nanocomposites exhibit improved dispersion of OMMT and better gas barrier property than the binary counterparts. \u00a9 2011 Society of Plastics Engineers.",

Methods: Biodegradable and porous starch/PVA membrane was prepared by solution casting and freeze-dried. At pre-freezing temperature -30 \u00b0C and the solution concentration 5%, PVA and starch mass ratio of 4:1 and 1:1, respectively, the prepared starch/PVA membrane was determined. Results And Conclusion: The interconnected porous structure was formed in the starch/PVA membrane, the pore size of starch/PVA membrane at 1:1 ratio was greater than that at 4:1. Both L929 cells and MC3T3 cells could grow in the membrane surface. The degradation rate of starch/PVA membrane can be regulated by the repairing rate of different tissues to meet the repair requirement.",

The results from AFM indicate the individual dispersion of graphene sheets in water. FWAs are demonstrated as highly efficient in suspending graphene with high concentration(6.2 mg ml-1). Subsequently, the obtained graphene sheet is incorporated into a chitosan (CS) matrix by solution casting to fabricate CS/graphene composites. Morphological observations substantiate the homogeneous dispersion of graphene in the CS matrix and the strong interfacial adhesion between them.

        "abstract": "From the point of better biocompatibility and sustainability, biobased shape memory polymers (SMPs) are highly desired. We used 1,3-propanediol, sebacic acid, and itaconic acid, which have been industrially produced via fermentation or extraction with large quantities as the main raw materials for the synthesis of biobased poly(propylene sebacate). Diethylene glycol was used to tailor the flexibility of the polyester. The resulted polyesters were found to be promising SMPs with excellent shape recovery and fixity (near 100% and independent of thermomechanical cycles). The switching temperature and recovery speed of the SMPs are tunable by controlling the composition of the polyesters and their curing extent. The continuously changed switching temperature ranging from 12 to 54 \u00b0C was realized. Such temperature range is typical for biomedical applications in the human body. The molecular and crystalline structures were explored to correlate to the shape memory behavior. The combination of potential biocompatibility and biodegradability of the biobased SMPs makes them suitable for fabricating biomedical devices.",

        "abstract": "The electrical properties of carbon black (CB)/thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPV) (EPDM/PP type) were investigated in details and their singularity was found. The crosslinked rubber particles in TPV can cause both exclusive effect for carbon black particles which is positive to current conduct and barrier effect which is negative to current conduct. At the low content of rubber phase, with the increase of rubber phase the resistance of electricity of composite decreases, while at the high content of rubber phase, the higher the content of rubber phase, the higher the resistance of electricity of composite, and the percolation behavior of composites with loading of carbon black is weakened apparently by rubber particles. When annealing the composites in the melt state, the resistance-time dependence of composites is strongly affected by the pressure of mold-annealing. At a certain time of annealing, the higher the pressure is, the higher the resistance is. When the pressure reaches a certain value, the resistance of composites basically has nothing to do with the annealing time. This is assumed that the restoration of deformation of compressed rubber particles in TPV would destroy the network of carbon black to some extent, which counters the positive effect of carbon black agglomerating during annealing. CB/TPV composite exhibits the NTC behavior even though the temperature is in the melting region of composite, which is attributed to the exclusive effect brought by the thermal expansion of rubber particles. The stability of resistance of composite in the melt state is ascribed to the competition between carbon black agglomerating (which is helpful to conduct) and rubber particles aggregating (which is harmful to conduct).",

The outer layer (PMMA) enhanced the dispensability of IPTT-Ca/ACR in the PVC matrix by increasing the interfacial interaction of these composite particles with PVC. The notched impact strengths of the blends were influenced by the weight ratio of IPTT-Ca to BA/MMA monomers, the weight ratio of BA/MMA.

The degradation behaviors of the SP films in simulated blood fluid (SBF) and simulated saliva fluid (SSF) were studied. Changes of their mechanical properties, mass loss, swelling degree, thermal properties and morphology of surface during degradation were tested. It is found that the films can keep the shape stability and certain mechanical properties during 30 days degradation. The biocompatibility of the SP film was investigated by cytotoxicity, hemolytic and cell culture tests. The results show that the SP films possess excellent cell and blood compatibility. All the results demonstrate that the SP films can be potentially applied as guide tissue regeneration films.",

The isoflavone of daidzin in sample A and B was purified under the optimum mobile phase composed of methanol/acetic acid/water=20.0/8.0/72.0 (v/v/v) at a flow-rate of 1.0 mL/min in one-step operation with a purity of 97.2% and 98.1%, a recovery of 95.3% and 96.3% respectively. The target products in isolated fraction were detected and characterized by HPLC analysis and ESI-MS spectrum. Preparative separation with sample-load of up to 2.42 mg/mL medium gave satisfactory results for daidzin with the purities over 97% and recoveries approximately 90%. Molecular docking simulations were utilized to help demonstrate the inclusion complexation between \u03b2-cyclodextrin and the isoflavones in samples through inclusion geometries and calculations of the binding energies. The prediction of the elution orders with AUTODOCK and SURFLEX-DOCK were validated by the chromatographic results.",

GPC, FT-IR, 1H NMR and DSC analyses confirmed the formation of amphiphilic block terpolymers. UV-vis spectra demonstrated that the PHIC block in the triblock terpolymers adopted helical structures. Increasing temperature is not favorable to maintain the helical structures. In toluene, tetrahydrofuran and chloroform, the PHIC-b-PEG-b-PHIC triblock terpolymers formed liquid-crystalline. At a concentration of 217.4 and 375 mg/ml in toluene, the triblock terpolymer crystalline structures exhibited rod-like and spheric shapes, respectively. A further increase of the concentration of the triblock terpolymer to 703.13 mg/ml led to oriented liquid-crystalline structures. Contact angle measurements demonstrated that the hydrophilicity of the triblock terpolymers was improved with increasing the content of PEG. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

HXNBR latex was obtained by diimide hydrogenation. The HXNBR/PVC composite film can be self-cross-linked without any additional cross-linking agent. The properties of composite films, including film-forming property, morphology, physical properties, swelling behavior, and ageing properties were investigated. When PVC content was lower than 30%, the composite film showed no crack in the surface, especially at 20% of PVC content, the composite film showed excellent mechanical properties.

The independently dispersed graphene core was first prepared through the chemical reduction of graphene oxide using a fluorescent whitening agent, VBL, as a non-covalent modifier. The negative groups of VBL, which are anchored onto the graphene sheets, impart anionic characteristics to graphene. The combination of the modified graphene with bulky Jeffamine M2070 chains through an electrostatic interaction yields a homogeneous graphene fluid, i.e., graphene-based nanoparticle ionic materials (G-NIMs). The microstructures of G-NIMs were characterized. G-NIMs can be stably dispersed in a broad spectrum of solvents with a super-high concentration of 500 mg mL-1. The intriguing properties of the graphene core and fluidity properties of G-NIMs may offer new scientific and technological opportunities for the applications of graphene.

The composite fibers were further vulcanized by peroxide. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations showed that the composite fibers had an average diameter of about 200 nm and a smooth surface. The dispersion of Eu-complexes in the fibers was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The studies revealed that the Eu-complex was dispersed in the EPDM fibers in the form of molecular clusters and/or nanoparticles with a diameter smaller than 10 nm. Fluorescence spectra and Judd-Ofelt parameters analysis showed that the luminescent quantum efficiency of the composite fibers was greatly improved when the Eu-complex content was 15 wt.%, because the fine dispersion of Eu-complex in EPDM facilitated the increase of radiative transition rate of the composite fibers over that of the neat complex powder.",

The microstructure of the AO-60/NBR composite was characterized by DSC, SEM and DMA, and its dynamic mechanical properties were studied. The results show that the dispersion of AO-60 is different in the various NBR matrix. Hindered phenol AO-60 forms a fine dispersion in the matrix of the NBR with the acrylonitrile mass fraction of 35% (N230S). A strong intermolecular interaction is formed between the AO-60 and NBR. Compared with the neat NBR matrix, the value of Tg and tan\u03b4 for the composites increases gradually with increasing the AO-60 amount. Moreover, AO-60/N230S composites have a high performance as a damping material.",

Four groups analysis (SARA - saturates, aromatics, resins and asphaltines), XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) and DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimeter) were used to characterize the structure and properties of asphalt and rubber in swelling experiment. The results reveal that the swelling of rubber in asphalt moved from a fast-growing process then level off to the equilibrium, and rubber absorbed only the light components in asphalt. The amount of asphalt components affects the properties of asphalt. During the swelling process, the amount of light constituents decreased accompanied by an increased softening point and decreased ductility and penetration. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "A novel poly(diisoamyl itaconate-co-isoprene) (PDII) bioelastomer was prepared by redox emulsion polymerization based on itaconic acid, isoamyl alcohol, and isoprene. Carbon black (CB), silica, and silica with coupling agent (bis(3-(triethoxysilyl)-propyl)tetrasulfide [TESPT]-silica) were used as fillers to reinforce the novel elastomer. The difference in morphology, interfacial interaction, thermal properties, and mechanical properties of PDII composites filled with different fillers was studied. The homogeneous dispersion of silica and CB in the PDII matrix was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Silica had homogenous dispersion possibly because of the formation of hydrogen bonds between the silica silanols and the PDII macromolecular chains. PDII/silica and PDII/TESTP-silica have lower crosslink density and crosslinking rate than PDII/CB owing to the adsorption of accelerators by the silanols in the silica surfaces. PDII/silica had comparable tensile strength but higher elongation at break than PDII/CB. The tensile strength of PDII/TESPT-silica was higher than PDII/CB and PDII/silica.

It was found that by increasing the acrylonitrile content of hydrogenated nitrilebutadiene dielectric elastomer, the dielectric constant will be improved accompanied with a sharp decrease of electrical breakdown strength leading to a small actuated strain. At a fixed electric field, a high crosslink density increased the elastic modulus of dielectric elastomer, but it also enhanced the electrical breakdown strength leading to a high actuated strain. Adding a plasticizer into the dielectric elastomer decreased the dielectric constant and electrical breakdown strength slightly, but reduced the elastic modulus sharply, which was beneficial for obtaining a large strain at low electric field from the dielectric elastomer. The largest actuated strain of 22% at an electric field of 30kVmm 1 without any prestrain was obtained. Moreover, the hydrogenated nitrilebutadiene dielectric actuator showed good history dependence. This proposed material has great potential to be an excellent dielectric elastomer. \u00a9 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The polymerization conversion of ZDMA and morphology of the VMQ/ZDMA composites were studied. The results showed that most of the ZDMA monomers participated in the in situ polymerization during the cross-linking of the VMQ matrix and uniform nanophases were formed in the composites. The 'dissolving-diffusion' model was used to explain the micro-nano transformation of ZDMA. According to the model, a uniform nano-dispersed structure could be obtained through the in situ reaction even though the initial dispersion of ZDMA in the blends was poor. In addition, tensile tests of VMQ/ZDMA composites showed that ZDMA had a significant reinforcement on the mechanical properties of VMQ, and the best mechanical properties were obtained when the amounts of peroxide and ZDMA were 5 and 40 phr, respectively. The gross crosslink density and ionic crosslink density increased as the amount of ZDMA increased, but the covalent crosslink density decreased slightly. These results indicated that the ionic crosslink structure had a significant effect on the mechanical properties of VMQ/ZDMA composites. \u00a9 BME-PT.",

        "abstract": "In this work, a new kind of electro-active polymer composite composed of silicone and polyethylene glycol (PEG) was prepared by solution blending. Two types of PEG with average molecular weights of 600(PEG600) and 1500(PEG1500) were first blended with liquid silicone (DC3481) separately. Then, the dielectric, electrical, mechanical and electromechanical properties of pure silicone and the silicone/PEG composites were investigated. The silicone/PEG600 composite shows an increased dielectric constant and a decreased Young's modulus, resulting in an improved figure of merit (FOM) and an actuation strain of 11.5% at 40Vm 1, which is 64% higher than pure silicone. This indicates that the actuation properties of silicone are largely improved by the addition of PEG600. However, for the silicone/PEG1500 composite, a much higher dielectric constant and an increased modulus due to its semi-crystalline structure are obtained, which lead to a decreased FOM and a smaller actuation strain than that of pure silicone. In addition, a comparison between theoretical strain and the corresponding experiment value was made. And the results indicate that not only the FOM, but the dielectric loss and mechanical loss play an important role in the actuation properties. \u00a9 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "According to time-temperature superposition,it is shown that at certain frequency,the higher temperature the lower modulus.At a certain temperature,the lower frequency the lower modulus,which indicates that elevated temperature and reduced frequency has the equivalent effects.Based on this,the mechanical properties of rubber materials at wide frequency can be obtained by the data in different temperatures.For studying the basic theory of the damping properties of rubber,a modified Williams-Lendel-Ferry(WLF) equation under pressure has been proposed in this work.According to the loss factor tan\u03b4 from DMTA experiments,the shift factors under different pressures might be calculated.Then,the mast curve of loss factor versus frequency could be plotted,in which the range of frequency spanned about ten orders of magnitude.The result showed that the peak of tan\u03b4 appeared below the reference temperature.With the increasing pressure,the glass transition temperature moved towards higher frequency,and enhenced by 1.5 orders of magnitude.This method offered the theoretical basis to quantitatively characterize the damping properties of rubber materials.",

The content of MWNT filled in TPU was increased till 40 phr (parts per hundreds of rubber). The morphological, structural and mechanical properties of the resulting TPU nanocomposites were systematically investigated using scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) and tensile testing. The results indicated that the unmodified MWNT were dispersed finely and uniformly in the TPU matrix beyond expectation, and the microphase separation structures of the TPU nanocomposites were slightly affected by the presence of MWNT. The mechanical properties of the TPU nanocomposites containing various amounts of MWNT at both room temperature and 120\u00b0C were studied, which demonstrated that the modulus of TPU were greatly increased and the high temperature tensile strength of TPU was also prominently improved when MWNT content is higher. Moreover, the TPU nanocomposites exhibited improved thermal and electrical conductivities that might mean the TPU/MWNT nanocomposites have potential application as multi-functional materials. \u00a9 Smithers Rapra Technology, 2008.",

Results demonstrate that nano-SiO2 is imbedded in the PGSC matrixes, and chemical bonding is formed between them. Nano-SiO2 presents finer and more homogeneous dispersion with the increasing of its mass fractions. The ordered structures of the matrixes are weakened after nano-SiO2 is added, but the ordered structures of the composites are intensified with the formation of inorganic filler networks. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the matrix increases when the nano-SiO2 mass fraction is lower, while the Tg decreases when its mass fraction is higher. The composites possess excellent resilience, and their tensile strength and modulus rise with the increasing of nano-SiO2 mass fractions, separately rising by 602.20% and 258.21% at its mass fraction of 16.67% than those of the pure matrixes.",

Dynamic rheologic behaviors of PET, PET-GF and PET-GF-EGMA composites were studied by means of ARES Rheometer. Effects of angular frequency (\u03c9) on storage modulus(G\u2032), loss modulus(G\u2033), loss factor (tan \u03b4) and dynamic viscosity!(h) were investigated. G\u2032 of PET is much lower than its G\u2033, due to slippage of molecular-chain. Introduction of GF leads to increase of both G\u2032and G\u2033, but its contribution to G\u2032is a little bit more, while tan \u03b4 decreases and h increases. Introduction of EGMA can also improve both G\u2032and G\u2033 of PET-GF, but its effect on G\u2032 is more obvious. Addition of small amount of EMGA can decrease tan \u03b4 of PET-GF melt effectively, which indicates that percentage of elasticity distortion in melt lifts.

        "abstract": "Two miktoarm star-shaped rubbers with large-volume functional groups of 1,1-diphenylhexyl at the ends of arms (DMS-PB-SBR) and one miktoarm star-shaped rubber with n-butyl groups at the ends of arms (BMS-PB-SBR) were prepared by 1,1-diphenylhexyllithium (DPHLi) and n-butyl lithium as initiators, respectively. The molecular structures and morphological properties of the three rubbers (MS-PB-SBR) were studied and compared with those acquired from the blend consisting of star-shaped solution-polymerized butadiene styrene rubber (S-SSBR) and butadiene rubber (PBR) prepared by ourselves. The results showed that MS-PB-SBR exhibited a more uniform distribution of PBR phase and a smaller phase size of PBR than that of S-SSBR/PBR blend. It is found that MS-PB-SBR composites filled with CB showed the lower Payne effect than that of S-SSBR/PBR/CB composite, suggesting that the MS-PB-SBR/CB composite (particularly the DMS-PB-SBR/CB composites) would possess excellent mechanical properties, high wet-skid resistance, and low rolling resistance. For the studied MS-PB-SBR systems, the contribution of large-volume functional groups at the end of PBR molecular chains to decrease the rolling resistance was larger than that of Sn coupling effect. It is envisioned that the miktoarm star-shaped rubbers with 1,1-diphenylhexyl groups at the molecular ends would be useful for making treads of green tires. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl.

The successful grafting of the GO sheets with Jeffamine\u00aevia an ionic structure was verified and the morphology of the SIL was characterized. The SIL based on GO (GO-SIL) exhibits excellent solubility and amphiphilicity. The rheological measurements confirm the essential viscoelasticity and the liquid-like behavior of GO-SIL. The present GO based SIL suggests promising applications in the fabrication of various GO or graphene based composite materials.

Because hydrogen bonds were formed between \u207bCOOH groups of XNBR and phenolic hydroxyl groups of PDA, the encapsulation of GNS-PDA around XNBR latex particles was achieved, and led to a segregated network structure of filler formed in the GNS-PDA/XNBR composite. Thus, the XNBR composite filled with GNS-PDA showed improved filler dispersion, enhanced dielectric constant and dielectric strength, and decreased conductivity compared with the XNBR composite filled with pristine GNS. Finally, the GNS-PDA/XNBR composite displayed an actuated strain of 2.4% at 18 kV/mm, and this actuated strain was much larger than that of pure XNBR (1.3%) at the same electric field. This simple, environmentally friendly, low-cost, and effective method provides a promising route for obtaining a high-performance dielectric elastomer with improved mechanical and electrochemical properties.",

With no loss of biodegradability and biocompatibility, we highly toughened PLA using a novel bioelastomer (BE)-synthesized from biomass diols and diacids. Although PLA and BE are immiscible, BE particles of \u223c1 \u03bcm in diameter are uniformly dispersed in the matrix, and this indicates some compatibility between PLA and BE. BE significantly increased the cold crystallization ability of PLA, which was valuable for practical processing and performance. SEM micrographs of fracture surface showed a brittle-to-ductile transition owing to addition of BE. At 11.5 vol%, notched Izod impact strength improved from 2.4 to 10.3 kJ/m 2, 330% increment; the increase is superior to previous toughening effect by using petroleum-based tougheners.",

The sol content,mechanical properties and degradation performance of n-HA/1,2-PPSC composites were also tested. The results showed that both the glass transition temperature and sol content of n-HA/1,2-PPSC composites decreased with the increase of mass fractions of n-HA and so did the degradation rate. The grinding method was an effective method to improve the dispersibility of n-HA and the mechanical properties of the composites. With the method,the tensile strength increased by 8.2 times,the modulus increased by 11.4 times,the elongation at break had little change.",

        "abstract": "A new composite with special piezoelectric property was prepared by using lead magnesio-niobate piezoelectric ceramic powders (PMN) as dispersing phase and carbon fiber (CF) as electric-conducting filler in acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) matrix. The dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the composites were studied. The results showed that particle size of 80% of PMN ceramic powders was 0.5\uff5e2.0 \u03bcm, and the packed density of PMN was 6.6 g/cm3. When volume fraction of CF was less than 5%, the content of CF had no effect on breakdown voltages of the composites. When volume fraction of CF was 10%, the breakdown voltage of the composite was decreased to 1/3~1/2 of that of the composite without CF. The piezoelectric constant (d33) of the composite increased with increasing the volume fraction of PMN, and appropriate delay of polarizing time or increasing polarizing voltage could be helpful to improve the value of d33. The optimal polarzing voltage was 7 kV/mm and the optimal polarzing time was 25 min. The dielectric constant (\u03b5) increased with the increasing the volume contents of PMN. When the volume fraction of CF was 0, the change trend of \u03b5 and dielectric dissipation factor(tan \u03b4) of the composites was opposite. When the volume fraction of CF was 5%, the \u03b5 and tan \u03b4 of the composites increased instead.",

        "abstract": "By studying the tensile strength of SBR reinforced by various types of carbon black,percolation phenomenon in the rubber nano-reinforcement was demonstrated,which was similar to the percolation behavior occurred in the rubber toughened plastics.The concept of critical particle-particle distance was hereby put forward for rubber reinforcement,and the factors which govern this critical particle-particle distance were discussed.Moreover,the concept of critical maximum particle diameter for reinforcement was also introduced(around 80 nm).Based on the percolation theory,some new viewpoints for reinforcement design of rubbery materials were put forward,including the interfacial interaction between rubber and nanoparticles and the smallest particle diameter for reinforcement.Meanwhile,this work also gained insight into the interfacial interaction between rubbery chains and nanoparticles at the molecular level through computer simulation,which indicated that the polymer chains in the vicinity of nanoparticles still possessed some mobility and underwent the adsorption-desorption process,even for strongly attractive polymer-filler interaction(in the range of hydrogen bond).From the kinetics and thermodynamics points of view,the results clarified that it was impossible for polymer chains to be fully anchored on the nanoparticles surface to form the so-called \"glassy layer\" surrounding the nanoparticles.",

The influence of nanosilica contents on the structure and properties was studied. The composites with different silica contents exhibited excellent comprehensive properties relative to unfilled elastomers. The tensile strength improved from 0.9 MPa to 5.3 MPa. SEM and TEM photos showed that the nanosilica dispersed as nano-scale network in the matrix, and the modified nanosilica exhibited good interfacial bonding with the matrix. XRD measurement was applied to investigate the changes in structure on a short-range molecular level, which suggested that the existence of nanosilica limited the formation of ordered structure. The DSC curves demonstrated that the glass transitions of the composites inclined moving toward a lower temperature as the nanosilica content increased. Results of the in vitro degradation test suggested that nanosilica content could adjust the degradation speed of the composites.",

Three key results emerge from our study. First, we show different scaling laws of the chains moving toward, close to, and around the posts. Second, in the flux process of polymer chains, the head, side, and middle segments display different scaling laws. As the chains come in contact with the posts, an enlarged motion discrepancy emerges between the head and middle segments perpendicular to the posts. For instance, the motion of head segments transforms from Zimm to reputation type, whereas the middle segments almost retain the Zimm motion. Third, as the spacing crack between two posts narrows down, a climbing effect along the posts can be clearly observed in the polymer motion.",

The DN hydrogels are synthesized via a heating-cooling photopolymerization process by adding all reactants of agar, N-acryloyl glycinamide (NAGA) and N-benzylacrylamide (NBAA) monomers, UV initiators to a single water pot. Poly(N-acryloyl glycinamide-co-N-benzyl acrylamide) (P(NAGA-co-NBAA)) with a triple amide in one side group is synthesized via UV-light polymerization between NAGA and NBAA, forming a strong intermolecular H-bonding network. Meanwhile, the intramolecular H-bonding network is formed between P(NAGA-co-NBAA) and agars. The sol-gel phase transition of agars at 86 \u00b0C generates the molecular entanglement network. Such a double network enables the hydrogel high self-healing efficiency (about 95%), good shape memory ability, and high mechanical strength (1.1 MPa). Additionally, the DN hydrogel is completely crosslinked by multiple hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) and the physical crosslinking of agar without extra potential toxic chemical crosslinker. The DN hydrogels find extensive applications in the biomedical materials due to their excellent biocompatibility.",

        "abstract": "Adaptive mechanical behaviors in nature have inspired the development of synthetic adaptive composites, with those responsive to water particularly relevant for biomedical applications. Polymer nanocomposites containing cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are prime examples of water-responsive mechanically adaptive materials. Although CNCs are biobased, the matrixes of these composites are exclusively petroleum-based synthetic elastomers, in sharp contrast to their biological counterparts. In this work, we attempted to probe the possibility of using bioderived rubber(s) as the matrix to fabricate CNC-nanocomposite with water-responsive adaptive mechanical behaviors. Specifically, natural rubber (NR) and epoxidized natural rubber (ENR) were used as the composite matrixes. Our results show that the water-responsive sensitivity and reversibility of ENR composites is much more drastic than that of NR composites. This is attributed to the strong CNC-polymer interaction (hydrogen bonding) for ENR, which leads to better filler dispersion and the formation of an extra CNC-polymer network in addition to the CNC-CNC filler network present in the NR composite. The synergistic effect of the dual networks plays a key role in tuning the mechanical properties and water-responsive sensitivity for various potential biomedical applications. Our study further provides guidance to make use of renewable resources to produce high value added water-responsive nanocomposites.",

The effects of particle volume fraction and size on the particle dispersion have been quantitatively determined to evaluate their dispersion/aggregation behavior in these polymer melts.

        "abstract": "Photothermal-induced self-healable and shape memory materials have drawn much attention due to the rapidly growing technical applications and environmental requirements. As epoxy natural rubber (ENR) is a kind of bio-based elastomer with good mechanical properties, weather resistance, and air impermeability, it is of great significance to incorporate ENR with recyclable, photothermal-induced self-healable and shape memory properties. In this study, we report a simple method to cross-link ENR with dodecanedioic acids (DAs) through esterification reaction, and during the cross-linking process, a little aniline trimer (ACAT, a kind of oligoaniline) was added at the same time. Then, the ENR-DA-ACAT vitrimers that were covalently cross-linked with recyclable, self-healable, and multiple responsive properties were obtained, which also possessed various functions. As a result of the transesterification reactions at elevated temperatures, the ENR-based vitrimers possess the ability to be reprocessed and self-healed, and the mechanical properties could be maintained even after three consecutive breaking/mold pressing cycles. Besides, the vitrimer is also responsive to near-infrared (NIR) light and pH with the introduction of ACAT, and we also find that ACAT can be used as a catalyst to accelerate the transesterification reaction. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the ENR-DA-ACAT vitrimer could also be used to construct the reconfigurable shape memory polymer; the shape fixing ratio and shape recovery ratio are both above 95% in the reconfiguration process, and the multistage shape memory performance can also be achieved by NIR irradiation, which will potentially lead to a wide application for ENR in the field of actuators.",

In this study, inspired by the special microstructure of TPVs, we prepared carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/TPV dielectric elastomer composites with a high dielectric constant (k) and low dielectric loss by constructing a dual network formed by rubber and CNTs. The rubber network was formed by a high content of agglomerates of rubber nanoparticles in the TPVs, which simultaneously promoted the formation of a CNTs network at a low content of CNTs in the matrix, to increase the value of k, and hindered the direct connection of CNTs with one another, to decrease the dielectric loss. As a result, the CNTs/TPV composites simultaneously possessed a high value of k and low dielectric loss. Moreover, the elasticity of the composites was improved by the CNTs because of the nanosprings of CNTs. This study provides a new simple and effective strategy for preparing a high-performance dielectric elastomer with a high value of k, low dielectric loss, good mechanical properties, high elasticity, high processability and easy recyclability.",

The as-prepared GO@SiO2 was introduced into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer to simultaneously increase the dielectric constant (k) and mechanical properties of PDMS. Then, the in situ thermal reduction of GO@SiO2/PDMS composites was conducted at 180\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h to increase the interfacial polarizability of GO@SiO2. As a result, the values of k at 1000\u00a0Hz are largely improved from 3.2 for PDMS to 13.3 for the reduced GO@SiO2 (RGO@SiO2)/PDMS elastomer. Meanwhile, the dielectric loss of the composites remains low (u003c0.2 at 1000\u00a0Hz). More importantly, the actuated strain at low electric field (5\u00a0kV/mm) obviously increases from 0.3% for pure PDMS to 2.59% for the composites with 60\u00a0phr of RGO@SiO2, an eightfold increase in the actuated strain. In addition, both the tensile strength and elastic modulus are obviously improved by ...",

        "abstract": "The use of conductive polymer composites (CPCs) as strain sensors has been widely investigated. A wide range of strain sensitivities and high repeatability are vital for different applications of CPCs. In this study, the relations of the conductive filler network and the strain-sensing behavior and electrical stability under fatigue cycles were studied systematically for the first time based on the conductive polymethylvinylsiloxane (PMVS) composites filled with both carbon nanotubes arrays (CNTAs) and carbon black (CB). It was proved that the composites could be fabricated with large strain-sensing capability and a wide range of strain sensitivities by controlling the volume ratio of CNTA/CB and their amounts. Additionally, the CNTA/CB/PMVS composite with 3 vol % content of fillers showed high sensitivity (GF is 10 at 60% strain), high repeatability (the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the max /\u2080 value is 3.58%), and electrical stability under fatigue cycles (value range of /\u2080 is 1.62 to 1.82) at the same time due to the synergistic effects of the dual conductive network of CNTAs and CB. This could not be achieved by relying on a single CNTA or CB conductive network. This study may provide guidance for the preparation of high performance CPCs for applications in strain sensors.",

For polystyrene (PS), poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) melts with low-polymerization degree, as chain length increases, they display different stretching ratios and show non-universal scaling exponents due to their different chain stiffnesses. In good solvent, increase of PS concentration induces the decline of gyration radius. For PS blends containing short (m\u2081 = 1 - 100) and long (m = 100) chains, the expansion of long chains becomes unobvious once m 1 is larger than 40, which is also different to the scaling properties of ideal chain blends.",

In this study, based on this new understanding of the microstructure of TPV, we further revealed the microstructure-properties relationship of EPDM/PP TPV during dynamic vulcanization, especially the effect of the size of rubber nanoparticle agglomerates (), the thicknesses of PP ligaments () and the rubber network on the properties of EPDM/PP TPV. We were able to simultaneously obtain a high tensile strength, elongation at break, elastic modulus, and elasticity for the EPDM/PP TPV by the achievement of a smaller , a thinner  and a denser rubber network. Interestingly, the effect of  and  on the elastic modulus of EPDM/PP TPV composed of rubber nanoparticle agglomerates is different from that of EPDM/PP TPVs composed of rubber microparticles reported previously. The deformation behavior of the TPVs during stretching was studied to understand the mechanism for the achievement of good mechanical properties. Interestingly, the rubber nanoparticle agglomerates are oriented along the tensile direction during stretching. The TPV samples with smaller and more numerous rubber nanoparticle agglomerates can slow down the development of voids and cracks more effectively, thus leading to increase in tensile strength and elongation at break of the EPDM/PP TPV.",

The CNT surfaces were first functionalized by a bio-inspired PDA layer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results showed that PDA layer with thicknesses in nanometers were formed on the outer surfaces of the CNTs. With the immersion of the PDA-coated CNTs (CNTs-PDA) into a silver plating bath, the silver ions attached to the CNTs-PDA surfaces were reduced  in situ  to silver nanoparticles by using the N-containing groups and reducing ability of PDA. The dense silver nanoparticles were further decorated on the CNTs-PDA surfaces under UV irradiation. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images showed that the spherical silver nanoparticles were about 3\u20134\u00a0nm in diameter and uniformly distributed on the outer surfaces of the CNTs. The distance between the nanoparticles was less than 10\u00a0nm. The as-prepared silver-decorated CNTs-PDA nanocomposites had excellent electrical conductivity, with a surface conductivity of up to 340\u00a0S/cm.",

        "abstract": "The mechanical properties and phase morphologies of cis-1,4-butadiene rubber (BR) blended with polyethylene (PE) at different blend ratios were studied. The tensile test results show that the PE exhibits excellent reinforcing capabilities towards BR. Blending BR with PE results in a remarkable enhancement of tensile strength, modulus and the elongation at break simultaneously. An increment of tensile strength from 1.11 MPa to 16.26 MPa was achieved by incorporation of 40 wt% PE in the blends. The modulus and elongation at break of 40/60 PE/BR blends are also about 5 times higher than those of the pure BR treated under exactly the same conditions. The tear test indicates that the tear strength also increases with the increase of PE content. It reaches 58.38 MPa for the 40/60 PE/BR blend, which is approximately 10 times higher than that of the pure BR. Morphological study demonstrates that the PE forms elongated microdomains finely dispersed in the BR matrix when its content is over 30 wt%, which corresponds to the remarkably enhanced mechanical properties. According to the results, reinforcement mechanism of PE toward BR dependent on the microstructure has been discussed and two different mechanisms have been proposed.",

In this study, we successfully prepared novel heat and oil-resistant TPVs based on ethylene-vinyl acetate rubber (EVM) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) by dynamic vulcanization (DV). The phase morphology, morphological evolution, and the properties of the EVM/PVDF TPVs were studied, and the microstructure\u2013property relationship during DV was revealed. Interestingly, a large number of EVM rubber nanoparticles are observed in the EVM/PVDF TPVs during DV, and these nanoparticles assemble into oriented EVM fibers and EVM bundles during DV. As the DV further proceeds, the oriented EVM fibers and EVM bundles agglomerate with one another more densely and further assemble into EVM spherulites, leading to an increase in the thickness of the PVDF ligaments and the deterioration of the rubber network. More importantly, our EVM/PVDF TPVs show good mechanical properties, high elasticity, good processability, excellent heat-and oil resistance, and good recyclability.

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, we introduced silver-coated glass particles (SG) into methyl vinyl silicone rubber (PMVS) matrix to prepare conductive elastomeric composites (CECs) with high electrical conductivity. The effect of the content of SG, the tensile strain and the stretch-recovery cycle times on the conductivity of CECs were studied. Interestingly, the conductivity of all the composites obviously increases with the increase in the applied tensile strain or the stretch-recovery cycle times to certain degree, different from that reported in many previous studies. The reason is that the dispersion of SG in PMVS matrix becomes more nonuniform with the increase in tensile strain, and the redistribution of SG in matrix results in the formation of much more new conductive network. On the other hand, the change in conductivity of the composites with the content of SG just exceeding the percolation threshold is much more significant than that with the content of SG far exceeding the percolation threshold. This is attributed to the more perfect conductive network in the composites with higher content of SG. The relationship between the conductivity and conductive filler network of SG/PMVS composites were clarified. This study provides guidance for the preparation and application of high performance CECs with excellent conductivity and stability of conductivity.",

The morphology, filler network structure, and thermal conductivity of the resultant composites were investigated systematically. The results revealed that nanoscale dispersion of GNSs was achieved and the dispersion level was obviously improved with the presence of S-Al2O3. The addition of small amounts of GNSs can greatly increase the thermal conductivity of the highly filled S-Al2O3/SiR composites. For instance, the thermal conductivity of the composite filled with 300\u00a0phr of S-Al2O3 was increased from 1.103 to 2.162\u00a0W/(m\u00a0K) by the addition of only 5\u00a0phr of GNSs, corresponding to an improvement of \u223c96%. We discovered that GNSs and S-Al2O3 exhibit a synergetic effect on the thermal conductivity improvement of the composite and the extent of synergy depends on both the loading and composition of the hybrid fillers.

Through a simple dip-coating procedure, catechol and polyamine could initially codeposit as a poly(catechol-polyamine) (PCPA) coating on the surface of the aramid fiber. Then, the PCPA layer could be further grafted with silane coupling agent \u03b3-(glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane) (GPTMS). Results indicated that GPTMS was successfully grafted onto the aramid fiber surface via the bridging of the PCPA layer. The interfacial adhesion between the aramid fibers and the rubber matrix was improved compared to that achieved by polydopamine in our previous study. In addition, this method is more applicable to the rubber industry than polydopamine coating because of its cost-effectiveness and short reaction time.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A facile and efficient mussel-like inspired modification method was developed to improve the interfacial adhesion of aramid fibers/rubber composites. The surfaces of aramid fibers were pre-deposited by poly(catechol/polyamine) (PCPA) layer, which was formed via the oxidation polymerization of catechol/polyamine (CPA) under UV irradiation. Then, the PCPA-coated fibers were further grafted with ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (EGDE) to introduce epoxy groups onto aramid fibers surface. The kinetics of catechol oxidation was investigated by UV\u2013vis measurements, suggesting that UV irradiation accelerated the polymerization process of CPA. The effects of EGDE concentration and grafting time on the adhesion force between aramid fibers and rubber matrix were evaluated by pull-out test, and a maximum increase of 85.6% in adhesion force was achieved, even better than that by dopamine in our previous study (a 67.5% improvement). Compared with the method based on dopamine chemistry, this method has advantages of lower cost (less than 1% of the price of dopamine) and shorter reaction time (3\u00a0h less in pre-deposition time). This study provides a new efficient strategy for fibers surface functionalization, which has promising application in rubber industry.",

It is shown that, under suitable interactions of block-block and nanorod-block, a continuous localization of anisotropic nanorods in a continuous block with a slight uniaxial orientation can dramatically reduce the percolation threshold. Such effect is reinforced in the systems with high aspect ratio nanorods, but can be suppressed as block stiffness increases. Meanwhile, the external tensile strain breaks the continuity of the three-dimensional network but induces strong orientation along with the stretching direction, leading to a decrease of homogeneous probability and an increase of directional probability.",

The as prepared NBR/PP TPVs exhibited good mechanical properties, good elasticity, easy processability and good oil resistance. Interestingly, the dispersed NBR microparticles in the NBR/PP TPVs were actually the agglomerates of secondary NBR microparticles with a diameter of about 1.7 \u03bcm and the phase inversion of the NBR/PP TPVs during DV was dominated by the formation and agglomeration of these secondary NBR microparticles. More interestingly, many PP domains were embedded in the dispersed crosslinked NBR phase, attributed to the chemical reaction between the compatibilizers amine-terminated butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymer (ATBN) and maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MP) and the voids among the spherical secondary NBR microparticles. As the DV proceeded, the size of the dispersed NBR agglomerates and the thickness of the PP ligaments in the NBR/PP TPVs decreased, leading to the increase in the density of the NBR agglomerates and the strengthening in the rubber network of the NBR/PP TPVs. As a result, the mechanical properties, the elasticity and the oil resistance of the NBR/PP TPVs were obviously improved as the DV proceeded.",

        "title": "New insight on the interfacial interaction between multiwalled carbon nanotubes and elastomers",
        "abstract": "Abstract   We studied the effect of the microstructure of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on interfacial interaction in seven kinds of MWCNT/natural rubber (NR) composites. Unexpectedly, the degree of defects (I D /I G ) of MWCNTs was found to play a key role in the interfacial interaction of MWCNT/NR composites. The content of bound rubber (BR) of the composites almost linearly increased with the increase in the I D /I G  of MWCNTs. Then we studied the interfacial interaction between MWCNTs with high degree of defects and NR. Interestingly, the BR of the composites consisted of loosely adsorbed BR (LBR) and tight BR (TBR). TBR occupied about half of the total BR, and cannot be removed by extraction in hot toluene for 48\u00a0h. Meanwhile, the mobilities of macromolecules in TBR were more restricted than those in LBR. We discussed in depth the molecular origin of the interfacial interaction between defected MWCNTs and NR, and then proposed that LBR was topologically confined by the steps-like structure of defected MWCNTs whereas TBR was principally chemically bonded to MWCNTs. This study provided new insight on the interfacial interaction between MWCNTs and NR and thus provides guidance for the preparation of high-performance elastomer composites with strong interfacial interaction.",

The as-prepared TPU fiber or fiber network was then pre-fixed in poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/TPU composite to improve the toughness of PLA. For comparison purpose, TPU/PLA composites with sea-island morphology were also prepared by traditional solution blending and mechanical blending. The results show that the toughness of PLA is greatly increased by the special pre-fixed oriented TPU fibers even at a low content, and the toughness is further increased by the TPU fiber network. Our results indicate for the first time that the toughening effect of special TPU fibers or fiber network is much better than that of traditional TPU with sea-island morphology. This study provides guidance to largely improve the toughness of PLA by designing the special phase morphology of TPU.",

        "abstract": "While the phase inversion phenomena in thermoplastic vulcanizates have been extensively investigated, the mechanism underlying the evolution from the sea\u2013island to island\u2013sea phase transition is far from being understood. In this work, such transition of the polyolefin elastomer (POE)/polypropylene (PP) blend was studied simultaneously by density functional theory and experiments. Before vulcanization, the independent POE and PP phases were mixed into a homogeneous blend. After vulcanization, the microstructure of POE was altered, leading to a metastable state of the blend. Thereafter, the blend decomposed into two new phases. Accordingly, the interfacial density changed with the sea\u2013island morphology transition. According to the nucleation thermodynamics, the predicted nanoparticle size of POE nuclei is in general agreement with our experimental measurement. Thus, this work provides a novel thermodynamic explanation regarding the phase inversion in thermoplastic vulcanizates.",

In this work, the chain conformations of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with addition of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) nanoparticles have been studied using a classical density functional approach. Under the strong interactions of POSS-PDMS, the radius of gyration of PDMS in the nanocomposites can either increase or decline depending on particle loading.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Dielectric elastomer (DE) composites have attracted much attention owing to their potential applications such as flexible electronics, energy storage, artificial muscles and sensors. The underlying mechanism to improve the electromechanical performance of DE is believed to be the interfacial polarization between fillers and matrix. Thus, understanding the interfacial polarization mechanism is a key to design and produce high performance DE composites. Despite of extensive works on studying the effect of fillers on interfacial polarization, the role of molecular polarity of matrix is still lacking. Thus, in this study, we prepared three kinds of carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber (HNBR) DE composites with different molecular polarity of HNBR as the matrices and a special kind of aligned CNTs as the high dielectric constant (e\u2032) fillers to study the role of molecular polarity of HNBR on interfacial polarization and dielectric properties of the composites. These composites exhibit the similar dispersion and filler network of CNTs in matrices, which is a precondition of this study. Interestingly, at the same content of CNTs (higher than the percolation threshold), the e\u2032 of these composites largely increases with the enhancement of the molecular polarity of HNBR, whereas the e\u2032 of these pure HNBR matrices is very close. An equivalent circuit was then established to quantitatively analyze the interfacial polarization mechanism, and it fits well with the experiment data. This study demonstrates for the first time that the higher molecular polarity of matrix leads to the stronger interfacial polarization and thus results in higher e\u2032 of the composites.",

Up to now, most methods focus on studying the interphase of elastomer nanocomposites. The filler-elastomer interaction forces have not been directly and quantitatively characterized yet. In this study, the interaction forces at nano-Newton scale between elastomer matrix and silica (SiO 2 ) were directly and quantitatively characterized by using peak force quantitative nanomechanical mapping (PF-QNM) mode of atomic force microscopy (AFM). Three kinds of nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) molecules with different molecular polarity were first grafted on the AFM tip by using click chemistry. The SiO 2  (or modified SiO 2 ) were pressed into flat films and worked as substrate. The interaction forces between these NBR layer grafted on AFM tip and SiO 2  (or modified SiO 2 ) substrate were directly and quantitatively obtained. The results show that as the acrylonitrile content of NBR increasing from 26\u00a0wt% to 41\u00a0wt%, the average interaction force of NBR/SiO 2  increases from 4.5 \u00b1 1.0\u00a0nN to 7.7 \u00b1 1.1\u00a0nN and that of NBR/m-SiO 2  increases from 6.2 \u00b1 1.2\u00a0nN to 12.9 \u00b1 1.0\u00a0nN.

In this study, for the first time, we developed a method to quantitatively characterize the interfacial layer thickness of carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/Natural rubber (NR) composites by using peak force quantitative nanomechanical mapping (PF-QNM) technique of atomic force microscopy (AFM). We obtained the modulus and adhesion distribution of the composites, and selected those CNTs close to the sample surface, where the CNTs show lower adhesion for the accurate characterization of the interfacial thickness. Then, we characterized the thickness of interfacial layer according to the gradient change in Young\u2019s modulus. The results show that the average interfacial thickness of CNTs/NR composites is about 9\u202fnm, similar with that in carbon black (CB)/elastomer composite (10\u202fnm) reported in previous study, indicating the good interfacial interaction between CNTs and NR matrix. The average interfacial thickness of the modified CNTs/NR composites is about 17.4\u202fnm, indicating the stronger interfacial interaction. The \u201cPayne effect\u201d and mechanical properties of these nanocomposites were also examined, and the results were consistent well with the AFM PF-QNM results.

        "abstract": "A mussel-inspired functionalization method was developed to improve the dispersibility and compatibility of silver-coated silica (SiO2/Ag) microspheres in silicone rubber matrix; at the same time, the high conductivity of the microspheres was maintained. The poly(dopamine) (PDA) layer was deposited on SiO2/Ag surface by spontaneous polymerization of dopamine. The SEM images showed that the SiO2/Ag/PDA microspheres are uniformly distributed and firmly integrated with silicone rubber. The PDA layers effectively improved the interfacial interaction between fillers and rubber matrix. The electrical resistivity of the SiO2/Ag/PDA/MVQ composites can be well controlled by adjusting the dopamine deposition time. Due to the favorable dispersibility and compatibility of the SiO2/Ag/PDA in the rubber matrix, the composites exhibited a dramatic increase in tensile strength (47%) and maintained their low electrical resistivity of 8.3 \u00d7 10\u20133 \u03a9\u00b7cm in the meanwhile at dopamine deposition time of 8 h.

Here we focus on the heterogeneous phase inversion in partially miscible blend of polyolefin elastomer (POE) and polypropylene (PP) using the classical density functional approach. We have shown that the blend decomposes into the POE-rich and PP-rich phases on the surfaces of POE or PP domains. For example, the free energy barriers and critical sizes of the POE-rich droplets on the two surfaces obviously decrease compared to the analogous values in the homogeneous nucleation. These values can be further reduced after introduction of nanoparticles, which act as the compatibilizer, improving morphology and final properties of the blend. These results indicate different phase inversion mechanisms in the blend, and can explain why different sizes of nanoparticles can observed in experiments.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) method, as a cheap, easily scalable, and eco-friendly method, was used to produce defect-free, unoxidized graphene. A surfactant-free technique was used to concentrate the graphene dispersion through stabilization by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) without functionalization. A special kind of aligned CNT bundles, which can be well dissociated into single CNTs in  N- methyl-pyrrolidone by sonication, was used and fabricate Gr-CNT hybrid by \u03c0 - \u03c0 interaction. A redispersed stable Gr-CNT dispersion at a concentration of 2\u00a0mg\u00a0mL \u22121  was used for preparing Gr-CNT/thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) dielectric composite. The results show that the addition of 3.0 vol.% of hybrid improves the dielectric constant of the TPU greatly. As a result, a 10 times increase in electromechanical sensitivity ( \u03b2 ) at 1000\u00a0Hz and 3.4 times increase in actuated strain at a low electric field (7.5\u00a0kV/mm) was achieved. The breakdown strengths of the Gr-CNT/TPU composites with 0.25 vol.% and 1.0 vol.% of hybrid are much higher than that of the pure TPU. As a result, the maximum actuated strain increases greatly from 4.8% for the pure TPU to 7% for the composite with 0.25 vol.% of the hybrid. Meanwhile, the energy density increases from 18\u00a0kJ/L for the pure TPU to 25\u00a0kJ/L and 48\u00a0kJ/L for the composites with 0.25 and 1.0 vol.% of hybrid, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, moderate content of polyethylene glycol (PEG) with ionic conductivity and low content of graphene oxide (GO) were simultaneously introduced into thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) followed by in-situ chemical reduction of GO (rGO) to prepare TPU/PEG/rGO dielectric elastomer (DE) composites with largely improved electromechanical performance. The results showed that PEG remarkably disrupted the hydrogen bonds between TPU chains in TPU/PEG/rGO composites and formed new hydrogen bonds with TPU. In addition, PEG molecules can also form hydrogen bonds with rGO, leading to the coating of PEG on GO and thus the separation of rGO from TPU. Interestingly, PEG and rGO showed significant synergistic effect on the dielectric constant ( e\u2032 ) of the composites, resulting in the large increase in  e\u2032  at 10 3 \u00a0Hz from 7 for pristine TPU to 71 for TPU/PEG/rGO composite. This was attributed to the increase in dipole polarizability of TPU chains caused by the disruption of hydrogen bonds and the increase in interfacial polarizability caused by the favorable electron transfer from partially reduced GO coated by PEG to TPU. The elastic modulus ( Y ) of the TPU/PEG/rGO composites largely decreased because of the plasticizing effect of PEG and the separation of GO from TPU. Owing to the simultaneous increase in  e\u2032  and decrease in  Y , the composite showed 49 times increase in electromechanical sensitivity ( \u03b2 ) and 6.5 times increase in actuated strain at a certain electric field over that of pristine TPU.",

In this study, we deeply studied the morphology development of POE/PP blends during dynamic vulcanization (DV) and its influencing factors such as the degree of crosslinking, crosslinking rate and shear rate. The results show that POE/PP TPVs exhibits smaller rubber nanoparticles (RNPs) and their agglomerates than that of EPDM/PP TPVs because of the better compatibility between POE and PP. The morphology development during DV of POE/PP TPVs is dominated by the formation and agglomeration of POE RNPs caused by the combined effect of dynamical in-situ crosslinking and the shear-induced break-up of POE phase. Higher degree of crosslinking, higher shear rate and moderate crosslinking rate of POE phase facilitate the rapid formation of smaller RNPs and RNPs agglomerates, and accelerate the occurrence of faster phase inversion. This study provides guidance for the preparation of high performance POE/PP TPVs by controlling the microstructure.",

The influences of types of compatibilizers and crosslinkers on the interfacial interaction state, mechanical and rheological properties of PP-GTR blends are investigated systematically. Particularly, quantitative nano mechanic technique of atom force microscope was employed to examine the change in thickness of the interfacial transition layer between PP and GTR phase with variety of compatibilizer and crosslinker types. Results indicated that styrene-b-poly(ethylene-ethylene/propylene)-b-polystyrene (SEEPS) and peroxide are optimal compatibilizer and crosslinker for interfacial interaction enhancement, respectively. The resultant PP-GTR blend possesses tensile strength of 14.5 MPa, elongation at break of 307%, and permanent set of 16%. It was expected that reaction activities of the crosslinker with GTR and SEEPS would have a significant influence on the agglomeration of GTR particles and the interaction between PP and GTR phase. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs), consisting of a high content of crosslinked rubber as a dispersed phase and a low content of thermoplastic as a continuous phase, are usually prepared by pre-blending rubber and plastic phases followed by dynamic vulcanization. They are a special class of high performance thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) as they combine both the excellent elasticity and mechanical properties of crosslinked rubbers and good processability and recyclability of thermoplastics. As such, in the recent decades they have attracted much attention and have become the fastest growing elastomers to replace unrecyclable thermoset rubbers. This review focuses on recent progresses in TPVs, and more specifically on the following issues: (1) preparation methods of TPVs, (2) mechanisms of formation of the microstructure of TPVs; (3) relationships between the microstructure and properties, (4) review of various types of TPVs, including general TPVs, special TPVs, bio-based TPVs, and TPVs-based nanocomposites, (5) future challenges on TPVs.",

The as-prepared BIIR/PA 12 TPV exhibits good mechanical properties, good elasticity, easy processability and good gas barrier properties. More importantly, our BIIR/PA 12 TPV still exhibits good properties after recycling several times. The mechanism for the formation of the phase morphology and morphological evolution during dynamic vulcanization, and the microstructure\u2013property relationship of BIIR/PA 12 TPV were thoroughly studied to provide guidance for the preparation of high-performance BIIR/PA 12 TPVs toward tire inner liners. As the DV proceeded, the size of the dispersed BIIR particles and the thickness of the PA 12 ligaments decreased, leading to the strengthening of the rubber network. Although the rheological properties slightly deteriorated, the elasticity, the mechanical properties and the gas barrier properties of the TPVs were obviously improved as the DV proceeded.",

        "abstract": "Herein, we report an approach to the preparation of a homogeneous styrene\u2013butadiene\u2013styrene triblock copolymer (SBS) dielectric elastomer (DE) with dramatically improved actuated strain by using a photochemical thiol\u2013ene click reaction. The stock SBS was grafted with dipoles (ester groups) to increase the polarizability of SBS. The grafting degree of dipoles on SBS can be controlled by irradiation time to control its electromechanical properties. The grafting degree of modified SBS increases with the increase of irradiation time, and a maximum grafting degree of 81% can be achieved at a radiation time of 40 min. After modification, the phase mixing of PB and PS blocks occurs and the size of PS domains largely decreases, leading to the obvious decrease in the tensile strength and elastic modulus (Y). However, the modified SBS still shows good tensile strength (u003e3 MPa). More importantly, the dielectric constant (k) largely increases for the modified SBS. The simultaneous increase in k and decrease in Y result in a large increase in electromechanical sensitivity, and thus a large increase in maximum actuated strain and the actuated strain at low electric fields (e.g. 15 kV mm\u22121). In addition, the modified SBS shows consistently low dielectric loss. Our study provides a simple, effective and controllable chemical method to prepare a homogeneous DE with a high k, large actuated strain at a low electric field, good mechanical strength, easy processibility, and recyclability.",

The grafting degree of the carboxyl groups dipoles on SBS can be controlled by irradiation time to control the polarizability and thus the electromechanical properties of SBS. The tensile strength of modified SBS significantly decreases due to the improved miscibility of polystyrene (PS) and PB domains but still greater than 1 MPa. Importantly, the dielectric constant (er) at 1000 Hz largely increased from 2.2 for pristine SBS to 7.2 for modified SBS with the grafting degree of 83%, ascribed to the increase in the polarizability of modified SBS by grafting the carboxyl groups on the PB block. The maximum actuated strains increased to 1.75% for modified SBS with a grafting degree of 52%, which is almost a 4-fold increase over that of pristine SBS (0.47%).

        "abstract": "Abstract   The interphase between nanofillers and rubber matrix, also known as \u201cbound rubber (BR)\u201d composed of a tightly BR (TBR) layer that strongly interacts with the filler and a loosely BR (LBR) layer that is physically adsorbed, plays an important role in the properties of rubber nanocomposites. Up to now, there is seldom direct evidence of such interfacial double layer structure and their thickness. In this study, we quantitatively identified the interphase of a representative nano silicon dioxide (SiO 2 )/rubber composites by using peak force quantitative nanomechanical mapping (PFQNM) mode of Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). The thickness of interphase was quantitatively obtained, and the double layer structure of interphase was directly identified based on PFQNM images and the corresponding force-distance curves, and was further evidenced by high resolution transmission electron microscopy. We further studied the effect of molecular polarity on interphase of SiO 2 /hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber (HNBR) composites. Interestingly, the molecular polarity of HNBR has almost no effect on the thickness of TBR layer but has a significant effect on the LBR layer, leading to the remarkable increase in the total interfacial thickness of the composites with increasing the acrylonitrile content. The mechanism for the formation of interfacial double layer structure of BR and the effect of molecular polarity on the double layer structure was discussed. This study provides a simple method to identify and deeply understand the double layer structure of the interphase, and thus provides guidance for the design of interphase for the preparation of high performance rubber nanocomposites.",

        "abstract": "The application of silicone rubber (SiR) dielectric elastomer (DE) as an actuator is limited by its low properties in terms of dielectric constant, mechanical strength and actuated strain in a low electric field. This work aimed at simultaneously improving the dielectric and mechanical properties of SiR by designing a dual-crosslinking network (DN) of SiR, denoted as SiR-DN. First, carboxyl modified PMVS (PMVS-COOH) was synthesized by using a photochemical thiol\u2013ene click reaction. Then PMVS-COOH was blended with a commercial silanol terminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS-OH) followed by the crosslinking of PDMS-OH using an amino (NH2) bearing crosslinking agent to form a PDMS-NH2 crosslinked network, forming a PMVS-COOH and PDMS-NH2 dual-crosslinking network. The as prepared DN structure includes the chemical crosslinked PDMS-NH2 network and the network formed by hydrogen bonds between PMVS-COOH and PDMS-NH2. The PMVS-COOH can serve as a polar component to enhance the dielectric constant and the hydrogen bonds can serve as sacrificial bonds to strengthen SiR. Compared with reference SiR, the tensile strength, tensile toughness, dielectric constant and actuated strain at low electrical field (15 kV mm\u22121) of SiR-DN 1.5/1 (with the PMVS-COOH/PDMS-OH mass ratio of 1.5/1) were all largely improved. The reinforcing effect of SiR-DN is comparable with the most commonly used reinforcing methods of room temperature vulcanizing SiR by adding nanofillers. Meanwhile, the actuated strain at 15 kV mm\u22121 of SiR-DN 1.5/1 is much higher than that reported in most previous studies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Grafting polar groups onto elastomer chains has proven to be an effective method to achieve high performance homogeneous dielectric elastomers (DE). Up to now, there still lacks an in-depth understanding of the effect of structure and content of these grafted dipoles on the electromechanical properties of the modified DE. In this study, three kinds of polar groups including carboxyl (COOH), hydroxyl (OH), and ester (COOCH 3 ) were grafted onto polymethylvinylsiloxane (PMVS) by using a photochemical thiol-ene reaction to prepare PMVS-COOH, PMVS-OH and PMVS-COOCH 3  DE. Three grafting degrees (15%, 50% and 95%) were prepared for each kind of modified PMVS. Interestingly, although the dipolar moment of COOH is higher than that of OH and COOCH 3 , at the same grafting degree, the dielectric constant of PMVS-OH is much higher than that of PMVS-COOCH 3  and PMVS-COOH. At high grafting degree (50% and 95%), the actuated strain at a specific electric field of PMVS-OH is significantly higher than that of PMVS-COOH and PMVS-COOCH 3 . The actuated train at 15\u202fkV/mm sharply increases from 0.2% for PMVS to 9.1% for PMVS-OH with the grafting degree of 95%, higher than that of the commercial silicone DE and the new structured silicone DE reported previously. These dielectric, mechanical and actuated properties are affected by the combined effects of moment, mobility and interactions of these dipoles, which have been deeply discussed. The present study provides guidance for the preparation of high-performance homogeneous DE by rational designing the dipolar structure and content.",

As a result of the exchange reaction of the dynamic imine bond obtained, this PDMS network exhibits the nature of vitrimer-like material, which is examined by solubility and stress-relaxation experiments, and the relaxation time is as short as 64 s at 130 \u00b0C. In addition, the vitrimer-like PDMS is malleable and capable of self-healing, and the mechanical properties can be maintained even after three consecutive breaking/mold pressing cycles. Especially, besides heating, this vitrimer-like PDMS can also be recycled and reshaped at ambient temperature due to the exchange reaction of dynamic imine bond when immersed in water, which will potentially lead t...",

The mechanical properties of the ternary composites were investigated using the tensile tester and Izod impact tester. The results show that encapsulation of AT by PP in PC enhances the toughness of the matrix effectively and give the best tensile and impact strength.",

        "abstract": "We prepared hydrogenated butadiene-acrylonitrile (HNBR) elastomer composites with random orientations of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and aligned CNTs, denoted by random composites and aligned composites, respectively, by means of a simple mechanical blending method. The CNTs were dispersed uniformly in the HNBR matrix in both types of composites. Interestingly, at CNT contents of 1\u20132.5\u00a0vol%, the dielectric loss (tan \u03b4) of the aligned composites increases slightly, and the dielectric constant (\u03b5\u2032) of aligned composites increases largely with the increasing content of CNTs, whereas both the tan \u03b4 and the \u03b5\u2032 of the random composites increase largely with the increasing content of CNTs. As a result, a high\u00a0\u03b5\u2032 (5000 at 1000\u00a0Hz) and a low\u00a0tan \u03b4 (0.42 at 1000\u00a0Hz) were obtained in the aligned composite with a CNT content of 2.5\u00a0vol%, whereas a high\u00a0\u03b5\u2032\u00a0and a high\u00a0tan \u03b4 were obtained in the random composites. The relationship between the microstructure and dielectric properties was qualitatively analyzed by means of the percolation theory and intercluster polarization model. The mechanism for the achievement of high\u00a0\u03b5\u2032\u00a0and low\u00a0tan \u03b4\u00a0for dielectric composites was discussed. This study provides a guide to design microstructure that yields composites with improved dielectric properties.",

        "abstract": "In this work, an elastomeric Fe3O4 nano-particles (NPs)/polybutadiene rubber (BR) composite membrane was prepared by using the combined technique of electrospinning and in-situ crosslinking. The results showed that the saturation magnetization (Ms) and the coercive force (Hc) of the electrospun composite membrane with 5\u00a0wt.% Fe3O4 NPs was increased by 21\u00a0% and 69\u00a0%, respectively, comparing with the membrane prepared by solution casting. This was ascribed to the fine nano-dispersion of Fe3O4 NPs in BR matrix by using the electrospinning and in-situ crosslinking technique because the re-aggregation of Fe3O4 NPs was largely restrained by the fast evaporation of solvent, the confined space of nano/micro-sized fibers and the rapid crosslinking during electrospinning. Our work demonstrated that electrospinning and in-situ crosslinking is a simple and efficient method to improve the dispersion of nanoparticles in an elastomer matrix, and thus prepare high performance elastomeric nanocomposite.",

        "abstract": "Because conventional filler carbon black (CB), used for elastomer reinforcement, is wholly dependent on the non-renewable petroleum resource, a novel starch modification for filler-reinforced elastomer is developed using two types of modifiers, i.e. resorcinol\u2013formaldehyde (RF) and a silane surfactant (S). Originally used as a curing agent for rubber vulcanization, the RF is here designed to interact with starch and rubber, and thus improve the interface. The S is expected to improve the dispersion of starch particles and enhance the compatibility. The RF achieved much higher reinforcement than the S. When the starch was co-modified by both, the mechanical property improvement of styrene\u2013butadiene rubber (SBR) was superior to that reinforced by CB. Modification mechanism was explained as that (a) the RF forms oligomer, and (b) the oligomer then undergoes condensation/crosslinking, which combines starch particles and SBR macromolecules firmly. This mechanism was subsequently proved by a suspension experiment, which refers to the experiment that measures the compatibility of modified starches with SBR in solutions of dissolved compounded SBR. Transmission electron microscopy shows that most of the modified starch particles are dispersed on nano-scale; scanning electron microscopy indicates fine morphology achieved by the modification.",

Four factors influencing the dispersion and conductivity are concerned, including polymer-nanoparticle interaction, nanoparticles with grafted chains, cross-linking of polymer chains, and blending of polymer. It is shown that the variation of the conductive probability is not linearly related to the corresponding dispersion for all the four concerned cases. As the interaction strength increases, the dispersion of the nanoparticles appears to first increase and then drop, while the conductive probability increases monotonously. Increase of the grafting density on nanoparticles can bring about the modification of the dispersion, whereas the variation of the conductive probability is M-type. The dispersion effect increases monotonously with the increasing cross-linking density, but the corresponding conductive probability appears to first increase and then drop. The dispersive effect of nanoparticles monotonously decreases as the ratio of added incompatible polymer increases; however, the corresponding conductive probability has the maximum value.",

Structure and mechanical properties of the blends were investigated. According to the analysis of TEM and DMA test, it was concluded that as for PP/EPDM/AT ternary blends, the typical \"sea-island\" morphology was observed, and the morphology of encapsulated structure like sandbag was formed in PP matrix besides neat EPDM dispersion domain, where EPDM encapsulated fibrillar silicate AT. The most-odds diameter (Dm), the number-average diameter (Dn) and the weight-average diameter (D w) of dispersed particles decreased with increasing EPDM. PP/EPDM/AT ternary blends showed higher yield strength and dynamic modulus than the corresponding PP/EPDM binary systems due to the reinforcement of AT. PP/EPDM/AT ternary blend (100/20/5) possessed the balanced yield strength (21.9MPa) and impact strength (47.7 kj\u00b7m-2), relative to 23.0MPa and 9.4kJ\u00b7m-2 of PP. The micromechanical deformation process-mainly debonding of dispersed particles and shear yielding was mainly responsible for impact resistance of the ternary blends. \u00a9 2007 The Society of Polymer Science.",

The effect of annealing process on the microphase structure and the properties of TPU/CNT nanocomposites was studied. It has been shown that CNT flocculation can occur in TPU/CNT nanocomposites during the annealing process. At a critical CNT content, which defined the percolation threshold, CNTs could form conductivity network. The conductive percolation threshold value of TPU/CNT nanocomposites was decreased from 10 to 4% after annealing process, and the conductivity of TPU/CNT nanocomposites with 10 vol % of CNT could reach 1.1 S/m after an annealing time of 1 h. The significant enhancement of electrical conductivity was influenced by the annealing time and the content of CNTs. The formation of CNT networks was also verified by dynamic viscoelastic characterization. The results of X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry indicated that annealing process reinforced the microphase separation of the nanocomposites. Mechanical properties test showed that the annealing treatment was in favor of improving the mechanical properties; however, further increase in the annealing time has negative effect on the mechanical properties. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "A spray drying approach has been used to prepare polyurethane/multiwalled carbon nanotube (PU/MWCNT) composites. By using this method, the MWCNTs can be dispersed homogeneously in the PU matrix in an attempt to improve the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites. The morphology of the resulting PU/MWCNT composites was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). SEM and TEM observations illustrate that the MWCNTs are dispersed finely and uniformly in the PU matrix. X-ray diffraction results indicate that the microphase separation structure of the PU is slightly affected by the presence of the MWCNTs. The mechanical properties such as tensile strength, tensile modulus, elongation at break, and hardness of the nanocomposites were studied. The electrical and the thermal conductivity of the nanocomposites were also evaluated. The results show that both the electrical and the thermal conductivity increase with the increase of MWCNT loading. In addition, the percolation threshold value of the PU composites is significantly reduced to about 5 wt % because of the high aspect ratio of carbon nanotubes and exclusive effect of latex particles of PU emulsion in dispersion. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The process involved the encapsulation of CNTs with PDA, the deposition of Fe2O3 on the CNTs/PDA surface, and the deposition of Fe3O4 on the Fe2O 3-deposited CNTs/PDA surface. In this process, PDA was used as an ionic sorbent to adsorb cations, and Fe2O3 was used as seeds to induce the coprecipitation of Fe3O4.

But asphalt is highly flammable and gives out a lot of smoke while burning. Its hazards cannot be ignored. To get safe application in the tunnel pavement engineering, we need flame retardant treatment on asphalt. The current research status of flame retardant asphalt at home and abroad was introduced and flame retardant mechanism of the flame retardant asphalt and the general application situation of the flame retardant agent and additives were introduced respectively. The testing methods of flame retardant performance and existing problems of them were described, and the future development trend of flame retardant asphalt was discussed which are no halogenated and low smoking with low toxicity and water resistance. Considering the use of asphalt on road, the flame retardant agents should be rich in source with low cost and good thermal stability. Preparation technology of the flame retardant asphalt should be simple and the flame retardant agents should not seriously influence the asphalt and its mixture performances.",

All the filler NPs were in monodispersed state and the interactions between these particles were purely repulsive. The polymer-particle interactions were attractive and their interaction energies were tuned in a broad range. Through the computational study, many important features of the behavior of particle-reinforced elastomers observed in experiments, including the Payne effect, were successfully reproduced. It was shown that the magnitude of the Payne effect was found to depend on the polymer-particle interaction and the filler loading. By examining the microstructures of the simulation systems and their evolution during oscillatory shear, four different mechanisms for the role of the polymer-particle interactions in the Payne effect were revealed that consist of the debonding of polymer chains from NP surfaces, the breakage of polymer-shell-bridged NP network, the rearrangement of the NPs in the network into different layers and the shear-induced yielding of the rigid polymer shell in-between neighboring NPs.",

Dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) are two typical isoprenoids which control the rate of biosynthesis and the molecular weight of natural rubber. A rapid, nonradioactive method for quantitation of DMAPP and FPP in natural rubber latex by liquid chromatography tandem with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was reported. DMAPP and FPP were determined in the multiple reaction monitoring mode(MRM)followed by separation with a silica-based C18 column. The external standard quantitative method was established, and the results showed limits of quantitation (LOQs) were 28\u202fng/ml and 33\u202fng/ml for DMAPP and FPP, respectively. The concentrations were detected 70-96\u202fng/ml and 242-375\u202fng/ml for these two isoprenoids in natural rubber latex. Recoveries of the method were in the range 81-93%. Daytime comparison experiments found that FPP had better stability than DMAPP.",

        "title": "Novel Design of Eco-Friendly Super Elastomer Materials With Optimized Hard Segments Micro-Structure: Toward Next-Generation High-Performance Tires.",
        "abstract": "Recently, sustainable development has become a significant concern globally, and the energy crisis is one of the top priorities. From the perspective of the industrial application of polymeric materials, rubber tires are critically important in our daily lives. However, the energy consumption of tires can reach 6% of the world's total energy consumption per annum. Meanwhile, it is calculated that around 5% of carbon dioxide comes from the emission of tire rolling due to energy consumption. To overcome these severe energy and environmental challenges, designing and developing a high-performance fuel-saving tire is of paramount significance. Herein, a next-generation, eco-friendly super elastomer material based on macromolecular assembly technology has been fabricated. Hydroxyl-terminated solution-polymerized styrene-butadiene rubber (HTSSBR) with high vinyl contents prepared by anionic polymerization is used as flexible soft segments to obtain excellent wet skid resistance. Furthermore, highly symmetrical 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate (NDI), different proportions of chain extender, and the cross-linking agent with moderate molecular length are selected as rigid hard segments to achieve simultaneous high heat resistance. Through this approach, a homogeneous network supported by uniformly distributed hard segment nanoparticles is formed because soft segments with equal length are chemically end-linked by the hard segments. This super elastomer material exhibits excellent wear resistance and low rolling resistance. More importantly, the wear resistance, rolling resistance, and wet-skid resistance are reduced by 85.4, 42.3, and 20.8%, respectively, compared to the elastomeric material conventionally used for tire. By taking advantage of this excellent comprehensive service performance, the long-standing challenge of the \"magic triangle\" plaguing the rubber tire industry for almost 100 years is resolved. It is anticipated that this newly designed and fabricated elastomeric material tailored for tires will become the next generation product, which could exhibit high potential for significantly cutting the fuel consumption and reducing the emission of carbon dioxide.",

        "abstract": "A new design strategy to produce a supramolecular elastomer with self-healing and dielectric properties by synthesizing an aniline tetramer (AT)-functionalized supramolecular elastomer (SE-AT) is demonstrated. The termination of AT in the supramolecular system not only shortens linear amide molecular chain to decrease glass transition temperature but also destroys the crystallization to achieve amorphous structure. The SE-AT provides two kinds of noncovalent bonding including \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking and the hydrogen bond, which makes the material more easily healed. The SE-AT20% can heal mechanical properties within 24 h at room temperature without any external stimulus. The dielectric constant shows a continuous increase overall with increasing AT content. The material exhibits good electro-mechanical properties, which is attributed to a simultaneous increase in dielectric constant and decrease in modulus. The maximum actuated strain significantly increases with the increasing AT content and the SE-AT20% reaches 10% at 1\u00a0V \u00b5m . Moreover, SE-AT exhibits the ability to regain actuated strain on the location of the mechanical damage after self-healing.",

However, the limited sensing range (<10%), low sensing sensitivity at small strains, limited mechanical stability at high strains, and complicated fabrication process restrict the extensive applications of these sensors for ultrasensitive full-range healthcare monitoring. Herein, a flexible wearable pressure sensor is presented with a hierarchically microstructured framework combining microcrack and interlocking, bioinspired by the crack-shaped mechanosensory systems of spiders and the wing-locking sensing systems of beetles. The sensor exhibits wide full-range healthcare monitoring under strain deformations of 0.2-80%, fast response/recovery time (22 ms/20 ms), high sensitivity, the ultrasensitive loading sensing of a feather (25 mg), the potential to predict the health of patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease with the imitated static tremor, and excellent reproducibility over 10 000 cycles. Meanwhile, the sensor can be assembled as smart artificial electronic skins (E-skins) for simultaneously mapping the pressure distribution and shape of touching sensing. Furthermore, it can be attached onto the legs of a smart robot and coupled to a wireless transmitter for wirelessly monitoring human-motion interactivities.",

        "abstract": "Commercial natural rubber is traditionally supplied by Hevea brasiliensis, but now there is a big energy problem because of the limited resource and increasing demand. Intensive study of key rubber-related substances is urgently needed for further research of in vitro biosynthesis of natural rubber. Natural rubber is biosynthesized on the surface of rubber particles. A membrane protein called small rubber particle protein (SRPP) is a key protein associated closely with rubber biosynthesis; however, SRPP in different plants has been only qualitatively studied, and there are no quantitative reports so far. In this work, H. brasiliensis was chosen as a model plant. The microscopic distribution of SRPP on the rubber particles during the washing process was investigated by transmission electron microscopy-immunogold labeling. A label-free surface plasmon resonance (SPR) immunosensor was developed to quantify SRPP in H. brasiliensis for the first time. The immunosensor was then used to rapidly detect and analyze SRPP in dandelions and prickly lettuce latex samples. The label-free SPR immunosensor can be a desirable tool for rapid quantitation of the membrane protein SRPP, with excellent assay efficiency, high sensitivity, and high specificity. The method lays the foundation for further study of the functional relationship between SRPP and natural rubber content.",

Different from the other methods used elevated temperatures for nanoparticles synthesis, the novelty of our method lies in its energy saving process and fast synthesis rates (~5min for AuNPs), and its potential to tune the nanoparticles size and afterward their catalytic activity. The starch, fatty acid and reducing sugars present in the extract are mostly responsible for repaid reduction rate Au ions to AuNPs. Strong Plasmon resonance (SPR) of AuNPs was observed at 560nm, which indicates the formation of gold nanoparticles. Uv-visible spectroscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and energy dispersion X-ray diffraction (XRD) were preformed to find out the formation of AuNPs. Proficient reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) into 4-aminophenol (4-AP) in the presence of AuNPs and NaBH was observed and was found to depend upon the nanoparticle size or the extract concentration. The AuNPs was also evaluated for antibacterial against P. aeruginosa. Before transferred it into antibacterial activity, it placed under visible light for 120min. The same experiment was performed in dark as control medium. The photo irradiated AuNPs was observed to be more effective against P. aeruginosa. The result showed that diameter of zone of inhibition of visible light irradiated AuNPs against P. aeruginosa was 17 (\u00b10.5) and in dark was 8 (\u00b10.4) mm.",

The yield of raw N-doped CQDs was about 83%, which is suitable for industrial-scale production. A detailed formation mechanism for N-doped CQDs involving self-polymerization and condensation of IPDI was demonstrated. Moreover, the obtained N-doped CQDs can be homogeneously dispersed in various organic monomers and do not need toxic organic solvents as dispersing agents. This advantage expands the range of applications of CQDs in composites. The N-doped CQDs dispersed in polyurethane (PU) matrixes emit not only fluorescence but also phosphorescence and delayed fluorescence at room temperature upon excitation with ultraviolet (UV) light. Furthermore, the phosphorescence of CQD/PU composites is sensitive to oxygen and therefore, the obtained-CQDs could be exploited in the development of novel oxygen sensors.",

The morphological, structural, and mechanical properties were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), polarized Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), dynamic mechanical thermal analyzer (DMTA), and a tensile tester. Each composite consisted of two phases: the NR phase and the NBR/AO-80 phase. There was partial compatibility between the NR phase and the NBR/AO-80 phase, and the NR/NBR/AO-80 (50/50/20) composite exhibited a co-continuous morphology. Strain-induced crystallization occurred in the NR phase at strains higher than 200%, and strain-induced orientation appeared in the NBR/AO-80 phase with the increase of strain from 100% to 500%. The composites had a special stress\u2013strain behavior and mechanical properties because of the simultaneous strain-induced orientation and strain-induced crystallization.

As alternatives to traditional synthetic rubber materials, flexible semi-inorganic rubbers such as polyphosphazene elastomers are now used as state-of-the-art heat-shielding materials. We have successfully managed to prepare a poly(diaryloxyphosphazene) elastomer (PDPP) as well as some insulation materials that are free of any fibrous fillers (with only the addition of inorganic oxides, such as fumed silica and zinc oxide). These polyphosphazene insulations exhibit excellent linear ablation rates (0.08 mm s\u22121 after a 20 s ablation test) as compared to synthetic organic rubbers.

The variations of macro-properties, surface characterizations, and internal groups were investigated by mechanical testing, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TGA/FT-IR), respectively, to study the thermal-oxidative stability of NR. The thermal-oxidative degradation kinetic parameters were determined by analyzing the thermogravimetric curves at different heating rates with two model-free methods, Kissinger method and Flynn\u2013Wall\u2013Ozawa method. The results all showed that, compared with pure antioxidant IPPD, the same mass of mixed antioxidants could indeed improve the thermal-oxidative stability of NR. Furthermore, based on the TGA/FT-IR results and quantum mechanics simulations, the autocatalytic, free radical chain reaction mechanism for the thermal-oxidative aging of NR was clarified, and the different function mechanisms of antioxidants IPPD and p-ASALa were also discussed. Except for functioning as a labile-hydrogen donor which is similar to antioxidant IPPD in protecting NR against autoxidation, p-ASALa has strong coordination abilities and large coordination numbers, resulting in the high efficiency in enhancing the thermal-oxidative stability of NR.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Our previous work demonstrated that the amount of residual solvent (RS) content plays an important role in determining the structure and properties of sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) membranes cast from dimethylacetamide (DMAc). In this work, another three most commonly used solvents during the preparation of proton exchange membranes (PEMs), including dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), were employed to prepare SPEEK membranes of different degrees of sulfonation (DSs) with controlled amount of RS content. It was found that the effect of RS content on membrane water uptake is quite universal, as the treated SPEEK membranes of the same DS always showed the same water uptake with the same amount of RS content, regardless of solvent types. Larger RS content always corresponded to the higher water uptake. For SPEEK membranes with relatively high DS, proton conductivity remained almost the same for the treated membranes cast by different solvents when the RS content is the same. While at low DS, the solvent type came into play and also affected the membrane structure and properties: the SPEEK membrane cast by DMSO always exhibited higher proton conductivity than those cast by other solvents with the same RS content. Such phenomena were related to the characteristic structure difference including the size of hydrophilic domains, crystalline structure and polymer chain mobility, which was caused by the different degree of solvent-polymer interaction.",

There is much less attention on amphiphilic CQDs (ACDs) and their potential applications. In this work, ACDs were successfully prepared by a one-pot hydrothermal treatment of oil soluble N-doped CQDs. The obtained ACDs exhibit favorable aqueous solubility, high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields, and excellent photostability, showing great potential in Fe3+ ion detection. Interestingly, up-conversion PL of the ACDs is also observed and successfully applied in two-photon cell imaging. In addition, the obtained ACDs can be homogeneously dispersed into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyurethane matrices. Importantly, a room temperature phosphorescence phenomenon can be detected in these ACD-based composites and the ACD/PVA composite films show an ultralong phosphorescence lifetime (450 ms), which expands the scope of research and applications of CQDs.",

Herein, a new convenient method has been developed to synthesize rhodium nanoparticles, in which carbon dots (CDs) were used both as stabilizing and reducing agents. The fluorescent CDs were prepared by microwave-assisted heating method using chitosan as raw material and the presences of hydroxyl and carbonyl on the surface of CDs were supported by FTIR spectra. Subsequently, CDs could directly reduce Rh 3+  to Rh 0  without additional reducing and stabilizing agents by heating Rh 3+  with CDs for 1\u00a0h at 120\u00a0\u00b0C. The resulting Rh nanoparticles have an average size of about 2.8\u00a0nm and the Rh/CDs nanoparticles also retain the fluorescent property of CDs. The hydrogenation activities of Rh/CDs nanoparticles were investigated. The results demonstrated that the nanoparticles had highly catalytic activity in the hydrogenation reaction of hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) and hydroxy-terminated butadiene-acrylonitrile (HTBN). Also, the presence of CDs could improve the fluorescent properties of rubbers after hydrogenation.",

Among them, poly(dichlorophosphazene) (PDCP) is an essential intermediate from which most of the polyphosphazenes can be synthesized through nucleophilic substitution reaction. One of the main challenges in its synthetic procedure is to control the side reactions such as undesirable processes of polymer degradation, branching and cross-linking owing to instability of PDCP. In this paper, we have investigated the stability of PDCP and its structural behaviors by the influence of various solvents such as DMSO, DMF, DMAc. THF, DCM, PX, and etc. The polarity of the solvents affected the P +  ions of PDCP, water absorption capacity and its intermolecular interactions which are responsible for degradation and cross-linking of PDCP. The polymeric species and their mechanistic chemistry are characterized by multinuclear NMR, FT-IR and mass spectrometry to confirm their detail structures by changing the solvents.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Ferrocenylphosphazenes have been attracting increasing attention for their special properties and potential applications. We describe here a new high-throughput synthesis of cross-linked poly(cyclotriphosphazene-co-bis(aminomethyl)ferrocene) microspheres via the polycondensation of hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene and 1,1\u2032-di(aminomethyl)ferrocene by precipitation polymerization. The mean diameter of the microsphere varies from 0.3 to 1.3\u00a0\u03bcm, depending on the concentrations of both monomers in a calculated molar ratio. The morphology and structure of microspheres were characterized by FT-IR, SEM, EDX and TEM analyses. TG analysis demonstrated their superior thermal stability owing to the presence of high cross-linked bonding. Magnetic measurements revealed that the microspheres are superparamagnetic with a saturation magnetization of 23.7\u00a0emu\u00a0g \u22121 . The electrochemical properties of the microspheres were also examined by cyclic voltammetry and the results showed a single reversible redox process. Room-temperature photoluminescence spectra of the microspheres exhibited a strong emission peak at 405\u00a0nm. The Brunauer\u2212Emmett\u2212Teller (BET) pore-size distribution maximum is about 37.4\u00a0nm that leads to efficient adsorption behavior. These microspheres were found to be an excellent high capacity adsorbent for the selective cationic dye (methylene blue) removal from contaminated water. The changes in parameters, such as contact time, temperature and concentration of adsorbate were examined to study their influence on adsorption capacity. The results obtained suggest that the microspheres can effectively adsorb methylene blue with an adsorption capacity increasing from 480 to 2160\u00a0mg\u00a0g \u22121  as the initial concentration was increased from 50 to 400\u00a0mg\u00a0L \u22121 . Owing to the superior properties and novelty of the synthesized hybrid microspheres, they can possibly be used in several applications, e.g., in catalysis, bio-assays, and electric and magnetic devices.",

The hydrazine hydrate/hydrogen peroxide/boric acid catalytic system could result in the hydrogenation of natural rubber (NR) under the latex state. The NR without hydrogenation contained around 13% of gel, when the hydrogenation degree reached 66.9%, the gel content was 34.4%. The decomposition temperature of HNR kept on increasing, which was all higher than that of NR and the glass transition temperature increased slightly. The cross-linking density of vulcanised rubber rose along with the increasing degree of hydrogenation, the NR cross-linking density was 0.114 mmol cm\u22123, when the hydrogenation degree was 34.6%, 42.7% and 66.9%, the cross-linking density was 0.182, 185 and 221 mmol cm\u22123, respectively. This further proved decreasing flexibility of the HNR after hydrogenation and weakening crystallisation of HNR along with increasing degree of hydrogenation.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe temperature-induced crystallisation (TIC) and strain-induced crystallisation (SIC) of natural rubber (NR)/isoprene rubber (IR) blends varying in blend ratio were mainly studied by dilatometers and wide-angle X-ray diffraction measurements (WAXD). The dilatometers results showed that the real half-life of crystallisation (t1/2) values of unvulcanised NR/IR blends were 50% less than the theoretical half-life of crystallisation values. From WAXD measurements, the degree of crystallisation of vulcanised NR/IR with IR content samples 30, 50 and 70% at strain 500% were larger than theoretical crystallinity values by 17.17, 19.99 and 29.69%. NR can significantly improve the property of crystallinity of IR during TIC and SIC processes. The results can be ascribed to the end-linked networks existing in NR which can simultaneously induce amorphous NR and IR chains into crystalline order in NR/IR blends and increase the crystallinity and crystallisation rate during TIC and SIC process.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The dimensions of reinforcing filler is a key factor in influencing the fracture and fatigue of rubbers. Here, the fracture and fatigue resistance of natural rubber (NR) filled with different dimensional carbon-based fillers including zero-dimensional spherical carbon black (CB), one-dimensional fibrous carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and two-dimensional planar graphene oxide (GO) were explored. To obtain equal hardness, a control indicator in the rubber industry, the amounts of CB, CNTs, and GO were 10.7\u00a0vol%, 1.2\u00a0vol%, and 1.6\u00a0vol%, respectively.  J -integral and dynamic fatigue tests revealed that NR filled with CB exhibited the best quasi-static fracture resistance and dynamic crack growth resistance. The much higher hysteresis loss of NR filled with CNTs weakened its fatigue resistance. The planar GO played a limited role in preventing crack growth. Furthermore, digital image correlation revealed that NR filled with CB had the highest strain amplification level and area at the crack tip, which dissipated the most local input energy and then improved the fracture and fatigue performance.",

With no loss of environmental friendly features, PLA was highly toughened by Eucommia ulmoides gum (EUG) derived from Eucommia ulmoides oliv. The dynamic mechanical analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and differential scanning calorimetry results show that the PLA\u2013EUG blends were immiscible systems. SEM micrographs revealed that EUG particles were well dispersed in the PLA matrix with number-average particle diameters of 2\u20134\u2009\u03bcm. The mechanical properties indicated that the tensile strength decreased with increasing EUG contents, but the elongation at break and the impact strength were enhanced. The notched impact strength of the blends improved by 5.9-fold compared to that of neat PLA. The PLA\u2013EUG blends exhibited distinct shear-thinning behavior; this indicated good processability, and the storage modulus and loss modulus of the PLA\u2013EUG blends increased with EUG content. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The structures of the samples and the reaction mechanisms were confirmed and investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance methods. The gel permeation chromatography (GPC) results showed that the molecular weight of the fully soybean-oil-based polymers could be easily adjusted by controlling the amounts of the reaction reagents rather than vary the reaction time. The oligomers and decomposition products of DCP in the DCP-initiated polymers could be completely removed by using a solution\u2013precipitation method, and finally, several purified fully soybean-oil-based hyperbranched polymers with high molecular weights were obtained. This work makes a great contribution to the sustainability of hyperbranched polymers.",

SGC is a novel supramolecular material with sliding crosslink junctions, and it acts as a high damping phase in ACM/SGC composites. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveals the presence of two types of hydrogen bonds in ACM/SGC composites. Micro-structure analysis shows a clear sea-island phase structure. SGC particles disperse fairly uniformly in the ACM matrix. A wide interphase region exists between these two phases, indicating the good blend compatibility between ACM and SGC. The damping performance of ACM/SGC composites under dynamic shear strain and frequency condition significantly improved with the increase in SGC content. Specifically, the loss factor (tan\u2006\u03b4) value of ACM/SGC (100/40) composite increased by 120% compared with that of neat ACM, according to the RPA results. The significantly improved damping property can be ascribed to the interfacial hydrogen bonds and the pulley effect of SGC molecules.",

Circular dichroism (CD) and ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013Vis) spectra revealed that the polymers took predominantly one-handed helical structures that were stable under heat. Deprotection of the t-butyloxycarboryl (Boc) groups in the homopolymers under acidic conditions produced polymers with primary amine moieties on the side chains. The polymers were soluble in aqueous medium, and turbidity test revealed that they were pH-responsive. Amino acid-based polymers were further used in the enantionselective crystallization of alanine enantiomers and  l -alanine was preferably induced to crystallize with the  l -leucine-based polymer.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Epoxidized natural rubber (ENR) was used as a compatibilizer to prepare ternary composites with natural rubber (NR) and nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR). The morphological, structural, and mechanical properties of the NR/NBR/ENR ternary composites were systematically investigated by using SEM, AFM, TEM, DSC, DMTA, and tensile testing. The NR matrix was the continuous phase, and NBR was the dispersed phase with a size of several micrometers. ENR reduced the aggregation of the NBR phase and improved the compatibility between NR and NBR. According to the rule of \u201clike dissolves like\u201d, with increasing polarity, ENR migrated from the NR matrix and was dispersed into the NBR phase or gathered at the interface between NR and NBR. Compared with pure NR, the ternary composites had a higher tan\u00a0\u03b4 at 0\u00a0\u00b0C and lower tan\u00a0\u03b4 at 60\u00a0\u00b0C, related to the wet grip and rolling resistance of tread materials, respectively. The results also indicated that the prepared NR/NBR/ENR ternary composites exhibited improved tensile strength and tear strength because of the strain-induced crystallization of NR. Therefore, the NR/NBR/ENR ternary composites are promising high-performance tire tread materials.",

        "abstract": "High-performance solvent sensors have extensive applications in many fields. In this work, we report a quite efficient method to fabricate electrically conductive natural rubber (NR)-reduced graphene oxide (RGO) hybrid films for solvent-sensing application. The RGO/NR hybrid films with three-dimensional continuous RGO networks were prepared by blending graphene oxide suspension with rubber latex, followed by solution casting and then in situ hydroiodic acid reduction. The electrical conductivity of hybrid film was as high as 49.3 S/m when filled with 5.00 vol% RGO, and the film exhibited an extremely low percolation threshold of 0.31 vol%. The solvent-sensitive properties were evaluated by detecting the variation in electrical resistance due to the swelling of NR matrix. It was noted that the RGO/NR hybrid films exhibited exceptional stimuli responses for organic solvents, however, with different sensing responses for different solvents. Due to the reconstruction of continuous RGO networks after solvent evaporation, the hybrid films performed an excellent repeatability for solvent sensitivity. Therefore, as intelligent materials, the conductive RGO/NR hybrid films have great potential applications in sensing fields.",

Interface modifiers are typically used for enhancing silica\u2013rubber interactions and facilitating silica dispersion. In this work, trimethylolpropane tris(3-mercaptopropionate) (TMPMP) was found to be particularly effective in dispersing silica and the mechanism was investigated. Furthermore, the mercapto groups of TMPMP were reacted in gradient with the vinyl groups of vinyltriethoxysilane (VTES), which formed a series of interface modifiers with enhanced modifier\u2013silica interactions and reduced modifier\u2013rubber interactions. After applying the modifiers in silica filled rubber composites, the Payne effect, bound rubber content, dispersion morphology, mechanical and viscoelastic properties were studied. The results indicated that the interface modifiers with multiple functional groups were capable of purposefully balancing the interactions between rubber and silica, which brought about flexibility to optimize composite properties.",

        "title": "Design and preparation of carbon black/carbon nanotubes/ silicone elastomer composites with high elasticity and high electrical conductivity stability",
        "abstract": "Conductive elastomer composites (CECs) with high elasticity, flexibility and sealability of elastomers and the high electrical conductivity of conductive fillers have been widely used in electromagnetic interference shielding, microwave absorpting, stretchable electronics and sensors. To achieve high electrical conductivity, the commonly used fillers are metal powers, metal-coated inorganic particles and carbon black (CB). High filler content is usually required to effectively improve the conductivity, resulting in low elasticity, low flexibility, and poor processability, all of which limit the applications of CECs. Earlier works reported the synergistic effect of two kinds of fillers with different geometrical dimensions, among which CB and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are two promising candidate that have been widely studied. However, CNTs are easily entangled and aggregated in elastomer matrix with low viscosity, resulting in unsatisfactory conductivity (mostly  10 4 \u201310 5 \u2005\u03a9\u2005cm).  Moreover, little attention has been paid on CECs with high elasticity, high electrical conductivity stability filled with low filler contents (low cost) for stretchable electronics and strain sensors. The relationship between conductive network and electrical conductivity as well as electrical conductivity stability is still not clear.   In this study, we designed and prepared CB/CNTs/polymethylvinylsiloxane (PMVS) composites with good elasticity, high electrical conductivity and good electrical conductivity stability by tailoring the filler network structure of the composites with a low content of CB and CNTs in PMVS matrix. The composite with 1.8 vol% of CNTs and 1.2 vol% of CB showed high elasticity, low volume resistivity  (271\u2005\u03a9\u2005cm),  and high electrical conductivity stability. CNTs used in this study were carbon nanotube arrays (CNTA) that were  in situ  synthesized on single-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets by chemical vapor deposition method. The negatively charged CNTs with a loose structure showed no physical entanglement, which can be well dissociated into many single CNTs and dispersed uniformly in PMVS matrix during mechanical shearing. The high aspect ratio of CNTs can help to obtain high conductivity at low filler content, whereas the isotropy of CB helps to rebuild up the new conductive network after tensile strain. On the other hand, these CNTs are curved in the elastomer matrix, become oriented during stretching, and can curve again after recovery, and thus act as nanosprings. The high elasticity of the CNTs nanosprings leads to high elasticity of the PMVS-CB-CNTs composites. We further studied the relationship between conductive network and electrical conductivity as well as electrical conductivity stability of PMVS-CB-CNTs composites. The results showed that CB and CNTs can form a strong dual conductive network at low filler contents, leading to a high conductivity. When stretching, CNTs act as bridges to connect CB and CB aggregations together, maintaining the strong conductive network and thus high electrical conductivity stability under tensile strain. After tensile recovery, CB and CNTs can reform a strong conductive network, leading to high electrical stability during tensile-release cycles.",

The microstructure characterizations reveal that SGC phase is dispersed in NBR matrix fairly uniformly with a distinct interphase. As SGC content increases, the loss factor of SGC/NBR blends gradually increases. The improved damping properties of SGC/NBR blends are attributed to the intrinsic high damping characteristics of SGC and the formed interfacial hydrogen bonds. In addition, the mechanical properties of SGC/NBR blends are unexpectedly improved. The tensile strength of SGC/NBR (20/100) is increased by 170%, comparing to that of neat NBR. The significantly increased tensile strength is ascribed to the increased orientation of NBR chains, because of the \u201cpulley effect\u201d of SGC and the successive rupture/reassociation of interfacial hydrogen bonds. The high damping and mechanical properties of SGC/NBR blends make them potential materials for use in isolation rubber...",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this work was to study the effects of three green plasticizers H\u2082O, glycerol, and soybean oil, on the properties of bio-based BDIS polyamides. The BDIS polyamides synthesized from the following biomass monomers: 1,4-butanediamine (BD), 1,10-decanediamine (DD), itaconic acid (IA), and sebacic acid (SA). It is interesting to note that the amorphous BDIS (IA-80%) polyamide was changed from the glassy state to the rubbery state after water soaking and induced crystallization at the same time. The H\u2082O-plasticized non-crosslinked BDIS (IA-80%) polyamides can be very useful for the preparation of physical water gel. The glycerol- and soybean oil-plasticized BDIS (IA-80%) polyamides displayed excellent toughness. The plasticized BDIS (IA-80%) polyamides were characterized by Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), mechanical testing, and X-ray diffraction (XRD).",

        "abstract": "Globally, we are faced with a massive growth in the number of urban vehicles. This growth comes at the cost of enormous fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and air pollution, commonly seen as a haze. With a strategy to fabricate low roll-resistance green tire elastomers from large-scale, bio-based chemicals, specifically itaconic acid, mono-alcohols and conjugated dienes, each of these problems can be reduced. By combining a molecular structural design with non-petroleum based silica and an in situ process to tune the viscoelastic properties of the elastomer composites, we have successfully manufactured silica/poly(di-n-butyl itaconate-co-butadiene) nanocomposite-based green tires that have very low roll-resistance, excellent wet skid resistance and good wear resistance, promote fuel efficiency and reduce our dependence on petrochemical resources. The results shown here open an important avenue for the synthetic rubber and automobile industry to ameliorate a major problem facing many cities worldwide, and also provide an effective route for resource sustainability.",

The number-average molecular weights of PDEII exceeded 140000 with relatively high yields. The physical properties of PDEII, such as glass transition temperatures and thermostability, were comparable with conventional synthetic elastomers and can be readily tuned by varying the ratio of diethyl itaconate to isoprene. The interaction between silica and PDEII macromolecules was effectively enhanced with the increase of diethyl itaconate content by endowing high polarity. The oil-resistance relevant properties of silica/ PDEII80 (80% diethyl itaconate, 20% isoprene) such as retention of tensile strength, retention of elongation at break and change in volume even surpass those of silica/NBR 240S after soaked in ASTM 3# oil at different temperatures.",

The present study describes fully renewable thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) consisting of synthesized biobased elastomer (PLBSI) and poly (lactic acid) (PLA) by  in situ  dynamic vulcanization for 3D-printed materials. The morphology study implied  in situ  dynamic vulcanization and phase inversion occurs and leads the PLBSI elastomer dispersed as microparticles in PLA matrix. Then, the morphological evolution mechanism was proposed and indicated the dispersed PLBSI elastomer microparticles are actually agglomerates of elastomer nanoparticles. The PLBSI/PLA TPVs perform good processability and reprocessability by rheological and recyclability tests. Besides, good  in\u00a0vitro  degradability and cytotoxicity suggests PLBSI/PLA TPVs are promising sustainable biomaterials. The superior strength and elasticity confirmed by the tensile tests of 3D-printed samples, and firm microstructure and the reliable printed accuracy of 3D-printed samples investigated by SEM implied the PLBSI/PLA TPVs were ideal 3D-printing materials.",

The covalent bonding interfaces, resulting from a ring-opening reaction between the hydroxyl groups on the silica surfaces and the epoxy groups of G-ESBR, were formed during the preparation of the silica/G-ESBR nanocomposites. By increasing the epoxy group content, the number of covalent bonds at the interface increases, contributing to an improvement of the interfacial interaction between the G-ESBR and silica and the dispersion of silica, which were verified and analyzed in detail by bound rubber measurement, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and rubber process analyzer (RPA). The silica/G-ESBR nanocomposites with improved dispersion of silica and interfacial interaction showed decreased rolling resistance and increased wet skid resistance. The mechanical properties of the nanocomposites were greatly improved with increasing epoxy group contents. The highest tensile strength reached 29.4\u00a0MPa\u00a0at a GMA content of 4.8\u00a0wt%, a 55.6% increase compared with that of the nanocomposite without epoxy group.",

Novel bio-based TPV based on poly (lactide) (PLA) and poly (1,4-butanediol/2,3-butanediol/succinate/itaconic acid) (PBBSI) were prepared in this research. PBBSI copolyesters were synthesized by melting polycondensation, and the molecular weights, chemical structures and compositions of the copolyesters were characterized by GPC, NMR and FTIR. Bio-based 2,3-butanediol was successfully incorporated to depress the crystallization behavior of the PBBSI copolyester. With an increase of 2,3-butanediol content, the PBBSI copolyester transformed from a rigid plastic to a soft elastomer. Furthermore, the obtained TPV has good elasticity and rheological properties, which means it can be applied as a 3D-printing material.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Biobased elastomer materials from renewable resources aimed at substitution of petroleum-based derivates for engineering application have recently become a growing research focus. Herein, we brought out the strategy to fabricate elastomer from biobased chemicals\u2014myrcene, itaconic acid, ethanol and nanosilica. Diethyl itaconate, which can be obtained via esterification from itaconate acid and ethanol, was copolymerized with myrcene through a facile method of redox-initiated emulsion polymerization. The copolymers with different diethyl itaconate contents exhibited the number average molecular weight range from 71,000 to 174,000 and predominately composed of 1,4-tans and 1,4-cis myrcene units. The glass transition temperatures of the copolymer were between \u221217.8 and \u221246.1\u202f\u00b0C. Combing the molecular structure design and silica-silane technology, we manufactured silica/poly(myrcene- co -diethyl itaconate) materials with comparable properties with petroleum based elastomer materials. On the basis of preliminary data, we believe that myrcene-based elastomer is versatile, making an excellent candidate as future elastomer material.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Bio-based polymer products derived from renewable agricultural and biomass feedstock have become increasingly important as these sustainable and eco-efficient products bring a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and saving of fossil energy in comparison with conventional pertrochemical-based materials. A series of bio-based elastomers from large-scale produced and petroleum independent monomers such as succinic acid, sebacic acid, itaconic acid, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, soybean oil, glycerol, citric acid, etc have been developed by authors. Same as conventional elastomers, bio-based elastomers possess low glass transition temperature, high elasticity and low strength, and this implies that they must be reinforced by nano-fillers. However, they also possess particular and novel properties due to their characteristic macromolecular structures and aggregation structure. For example, the existence of abundant ester groups, terminal carboxyl groups, and terminal hydroxyl groups in bio-based polyester elastomers endow polar fillers like silica disperse homogeneous in the elastomer matrix without surface modification. Even though, for incorporation of easily agglomerated fillers like graphene and layered silicates, elaborately dispersion and interfacial tailoring technique is necessary. Combined with specific structures and relevant effective composite technology, bio-based elastomer composites exhibit versatile potential applications in tire tread, PLA toughener, thermoplastic vulcanizates, and dielectric elastomer, etc.",

The introduction of covalent bonds significantly improved the interfacial interaction and dispersion of silica, which was indicated by transmission electron microscopy and rubber process analyzer (RPA) results.

The interfacial interaction, thermal properties, morphology, and mechanical properties of the nanocomposites were investigated. The hydrogen bonds were confirmed in the nanocomposites. Morphology investigation showed uniform and individual dispersion of HNTs in the PDIM matrix. With the incorporation of HNTs into the PDIM matrix, the tensile strength and the fracture energy were significantly improved without sacrificing the extensibility. The improved mechanical properties were correlated to the co-coagulation and the strong hydrogen bonds. Especially, the morphology investigation of tensile fracture surfaces revealed a mechanism for the improved mechanical performance, in which the stress was efficiently transferred from PDIM to HNTs via hydrogen bonds and then the dissociation of the hydrogen bonds dissipated energy to increase the fracture energy of the nanocomposites.",

Dialkyl itaconate to isoprene reactivity ratios measured by Kelen\u2013Tudos method demonstrated that PDAIIs with short side chains tended to alternate copolymerized and the long side chain ones tented to gradient copolymerized. Glass transition temperature, dielectric properties, and thermal stability of the PDAIIs were studied and these properties were tunable by varying the side chain length. Tensile tests revealed that cross-linked PDAIIs are elastic with a high elongation at break. With renewable resources and the side chain adjustability, PDAII elastomers potentially have a positive economic and ecological impact.",

However, its excellent mechanical properties are disappointed eclipsed by its inherent poor toughness. Herein, a novel bio-based elastomer poly (2,3-butanediol- co -1,4-butanediol- co -succinate) (PBBS) was designed and synthesized from three bio-based monomers in order to improve the toughness of PBS. Butanedio and succinic acid were used to ensure a good compatibility between PBBS and PBS, while 2,3-BDO was introduced into PBBS to inhibit the crystallization of PBBS and promote high elasticity of PBBS. Besides, 2,3-BDO could tailor the compatibility between PBBS and PBS and helps to adjust the phase separated structure. The elongation at break and impact strength of the PBBS/PBS blend could improve from 350% and 4.7 kJ/m 2  to 525% and 41.7kJ/m 2  compared with the neat PBS. The synthesized PBBS shows a super toughing effect on PBS without any compatilizer, which could contribute to a wider application of PBS.",

        "abstract": "By employing coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation, we simulate the spatial organization of the polymer-grafted nanoparticles (NPs) in homopolymer matrix and the resulting mechanical performance, by particularly regulating the grafted chain length and flexibility. The morphologies ranging from the agglomerate, cylinder, sheet, and string to full dispersion are observed, by gradually increasing the grafted chain length. The radial distribution function and the total interaction energy between NPs are calculated. Meanwhile, the stress\u207bstrain behavior of each morphology and the morphological evolution during the uniaxial tension are simulated. In particular, the sheet structure exhibits the best mechanical reinforcement compared to other morphologies. In addition, the change of the grafted chain flexibility to semi-flexibility leads to the variation of the morphology. We also find that at long grafted chain length, the stress\u207bstrain behavior of the system with the semi-flexible grafted chain begins to exceed that of the system with the flexible grafted chain, attributed to the physical inter-locking interaction between the matrix and grafted polymer chains. A similar transition trend is as well found in the presence of the interfacial chemical couplings between grafted and matrix polymer chains. In general, this work is expected to help to design and fabricate high performance polymer nanocomposites filled with grafted NPs with excellent and controllable mechanical properties.",

        "abstract": "Although the research of the self-assembly of tri-block copolymers has been carried out widely, little attention has been paid to study the mechanical properties and to establish its structure-property relation, which is of utmost significance for its practical applications. Here, we adopt molecular dynamics simulation to study the static and dynamic mechanical properties of the ABA tri-block copolymer, by systematically varying the morphology, the interaction strength between A-A blocks, the temperature, the dynamic shear amplitude and frequency. In our simulation, we set the self-assembled structure formed by A-blocks to be in the glassy state, with the B-blocks in the rubbery state. With the increase of the content of A-blocks, the spherical, cylindrical and lamellar domains are formed, respectively, exhibiting a gradual increase of the stress-strain behavior. During the self-assembly process, the stress-strain curve is as well enhanced. The increase of the interaction strength between A-A blocks improves the stress-strain behavior and reduces the dynamic hysteresis loss. Since the cylindrical domains are randomly dispersed, the stress-strain behavior exhibits the isotropic mechanical property; while for the lamellar domains, the mechanical property seems to be better along the direction perpendicular to than parallel to the lamellar direction. In addition, we observe that with the increase of the dynamic shear amplitude and frequency, the self-assembled domains become broken up, resulting in the decrease of the storage modulus and the increase of the hysteresis loss, which holds the same conclusion for the increase of the temperature. Our work provides some valuable guidance to tune the static and dynamic mechanical properties of ABA tri-block copolymer in the field of various applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) attract considerable scientific and engineering interest because of their excellent mechanical, electrical and thermal properties. Today, when manufacturers use CNTs, purification, chemical modifications and dispersion techniques are usually applied rendering them cost-effective in large-scale applications. Our research shows that multi-wall CNTs bundles (MWCNTBs) with the same alignment, orientation and high surface defects for each CNT can be directly incorporated into the elastomer matrix through melt compounding. A uniform dispersion of CNTs and strong interfacial interactions between elastomers and CNTs due to the silane-coupling agent can be simultaneously produced. The resulting elastomer/MWCNTBs nanocomposites demonstrate excellent mechanical properties, high thermal conductivity and low volume resistivity. Note that this nanocomposite is achieved using common compounding equipment that is easy to industrialize. Through further scale-up, we confirmed that this elastomer/MWCNTBs nanocomposite has the most optimized comprehensive performance with practical applications for fuel-savings and engineering tires. These advantages include fuel efficiency, anti-static electricity and long-time fatigue resistance. In light of the large number of tires used worldwide, this work is promising for future large-scale industrial applications of CNTs.",

        "abstract": "In this work, by adopting the united atom model of cis-1,4-poly(butadiene) (PB), we systemically investigate the effect of the chain structure on the glass transition temperature (Tg) and the viscoelastic property of PB system. First, we analyze the atom translational mobility, bond reorientation dynamics, torsional dynamics, conformational transition rate, and dynamic heterogeneity of the PB chains with different chain structures in detail by determining the corresponding Tg. In addition, our results clearly indicate that with the decrease of the amount of the free end atoms of PB via the end-linking method, the mobility of the PB chains quickly decreases. As a result, the Tg of the PB chains gradually increases. Depending on the chain structure and the calculation method, the Tg of the PB chains varies from 154 to 240 K. In addition, the temperature dependence of the dynamic properties has different Arrhenius behaviors above and below Tg. The calculated activation energy varies from 7.37 to 16.37 KJ/mol for different chain structures above Tg, which can be compared with those for other polymers. In addition, through the end-linking approach the strong interaction between the PB chains improves the storage modulus G\u2032 and the loss modulus G\u2033. Meanwhile, the immobility of the free end atoms effectively reduces the friction loss of the chains under the shear field, which is reflected by the low loss factor tan\u2061\u03b4. In summary, this work can further help to understand the effect of the chain structure on the dynamic properties of the PB chains. Meanwhile, it provides an effective approach to reduce the energy loss during the dynamic periodic deformation, which can cut the fuel consumption via the end-linking method. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "title": "Understanding the structural evolution under the oscillatory shear field to determine the viscoelastic behavior of nanorod filled polymer nanocomposites",
        "abstract": "Abstract   By taking advantage of the classic coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation, we have examined the effect of oscillatory shear strain amplitude on the viscoelastic behavior of nanorod (NR) filled polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) by tuning the interfacial interaction between polymer and NRs. We have observed the Payne effect (referred to the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior) at strong interfacial interaction. Payne-effect magnitude gradually increases with the interfacial interaction and the NR volume fraction. To understand the origin of Payne-effect, we examine the NR microstructures and their evolution during the shear field. We find that at low interfacial interaction, the probability of forming NR network is nearly unchanged with the shear strain amplitude; while at strong interfacial interaction, on the contrary the probability significantly decreases with the shear strain amplitude. We infer that various interfacial interactions change the NR network, influencing their evolution behavior under the shear flow. Meanwhile, we calculate the main cluster size and the total number of clusters for the NR network at different shear strain amplitudes, which is consistent with the probability of forming NR network. Thus, the original NR microstructure is significantly broken down under the external shear field, which can also be reflected by the number for polymer-mediated NR network bridged by glassy chains and the connected polymer beads between NRs. In addition, the polymer chains can slip on the filler surface under the shear field. As a result, the observed Payne effect comes from the slippage of the interfacial chains and breakage of the polymer-mediated NR network bridged by glassy chains at strong interfacial interaction. While at low interfacial interaction, it exhibits a weak non-linear behavior. Additionally, both reinforcement and Payne-effect magnitude exhibit a linear dependence on the inverse of the aspect ratio of the NRs. At last, different contributions to reinforcement due to hydrodynamic effects, \u201coccluded rubber\u201d, and \u201cfiller network\u201d are quantified where the \u201cfiller network\u201d is the main contribution. In summary, this work provides some interesting results to help further understand the relationship between the viscoelastic behavior and the NR network under the shear flow.",

        "abstract": "In this work by adopting coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation, we focus our attention on investigating the effect of the chemical coupling between polymer and nanoparticles (NPs) on the viscoelastic properties of polymer nanocomposites (PNCs). Firstly we examine the effect of the interfacial chemical coupling on the non-linear behavior, such as the change of the storage moduli, the loss moduli and the loss factor as a function of the strain amplitude. Besides the reinforcing effect contributed by the interfacial chemical interaction, a much smaller loss factor is also observed attributed to less molecular friction and dissipation. Meanwhile, the effects of temperature, frequency, and the interfacial physical interaction between NPs and polymers on the viscoelastic properties are also probed. To uncover the structural and dynamic effect of the interfacial chemical coupling, we calculate the radial distribution function of polymer chains around NPs, the content of the polymer beads in the first layer of the interfacial region under quiescent and dynamic conditions, the incoherent intermediate dynamic structure factor of the polymer beads, which are chemically or physically tethered to the NPs, and all the polymer beads of the system, the quantitative comparison of the mean relaxation time for different interfacial chemical coupling, and the mean-square displacement of the polymer chains. Lastly we analyze the change of the interfacial energy such as the physical and chemical energies during oscillatory shear. Through these analyses, we conclude that with the increase of the interfacial chemical coupling, the change extent of the interfacial physical interaction versus the periodic strain decreases, attributed to a much smaller adsorption\u2013desorption reversible process. This can rationalize the much weaker non-linear behavior or the \u201cPayne effect\u201d. Based on these results, we anticipate that a better molecular-level understanding is provided on the effect of the interfacial coupling on the viscoelastic properties of PNCs.",

The mechanical reinforcement efficiency is found to be determined by the NR/polymer interfacial properties, which are in turn modulated by the grafting density, the grafted chain length, and the graft\u2013matrix interaction strength. By systematically analyzing the evolution of the polymer-grafted NRs during mechanical deformation, we find that the NRs aligning side by side with each other do not contribute much to the mechanical reinforcement.

In the present work, we reveal the formation mechanism of bound rubber in elastomer nanocomposites, using the coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations.

The polymer\u2013nanoparticle\u2013solvent systems, mimicking the oil-swollen rubber in the experiment, are simulated with three models. From the analysis of the potential energy, the static structure and dynamic diffusing processes, all the models indicate that the increase of the volume fraction of the nanoparticles and the polymer\u2212nanoparticle interaction strength could promote the formation of the bound rubber. The existence of solvent disrupts the bound rubber, and eventually deteriorates the mechanical properties. These simulations could provide some theoretical guidance for a better understanding of the formation mechanism of the bound rubber, which is helpful for designing the elastomer materials with excellent mechanical properties.",

        "abstract": "C5 and C9 petroleum resins are widely used in the rubber industry and their softening, tackifying and reinforcing effects highly depend on their compatibility and interaction strength with the rubber matrix. Herein, we chose five commercially used petroleum resins and two industrial solution polymerized styrene-butadiene rubbers (SSBR). By employing atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, the influence of resin composition on the compatibility was studied. Results show that different compatibility orders obtained from the solubility parameter (\u03b4), binding energy (Ebinding), mean square displacement (MSD), and the related self-diffusion coefficient (Ds) match well with each other, and are consistent with our experimental solubility parameter data. More importantly, by calculating the non-bond energy (Enon-bond) between single resin chain and rubber units (styrene unit, trans-1,4 unit, cis-1,4 unit, and vinyl unit), it was found that the styrene unit has the strongest interaction with resins, while the cis-1,4 unit has the weakest, which fits well with the solubility parameter result that resins have better compatibility with SSBR than cis-polybutadiene rubber (cis-BR). This chain/unit level MD method saves much time compared to the traditional chain/chain level method. In general, by combining MD simulation and experiments, our work provides some guidance to a compatibility investigation between rubbers and resins, and may promote design and development of high-performance resins and other new materials.",

        "abstract": "In this work, by employing molecular dynamics simulations in a united atomistic resolution, we explored the rupture mechanism of carbon nanotube (CNT) filled cis-1,4-polybutadiene (PB) nanocomposites. We observed that the rupture resistance capability increases with the interfacial interaction between PB and CNTs, as well as the loading of CNTs, attributed to the enhanced chain orientation along the deformed direction to sustain the external force, particularly those near voids. The number of voids is quantified as a function of the strain, exhibiting a non-monotonic behavior because of the coalescence of small voids into larger ones at high strain. However, the number of voids is greatly reduced by stronger PB\u2013CNT interaction and higher loading of CNTs. During the rupture process, the maximum van der Waals energy change reflects the maximum conformational transition rate and the largest number of voids. Meanwhile, the strain at the maximum orientation degree of bonds is roughly consistent with that at the maximum square radius of gyration of chains. After the failure, the stress gradually decreases with the strain, accompanied by the contraction of the highly orientated polymer bundles. In particular, with weak interfacial interaction, the nucleation of voids occurs in the interface, and in the polymer matrix in the strong case. In general, this work could provide some fundamental understanding of the voids occurring in polymer nanocomposites (PNCs), with the aim to design and fabricate high performance PNCs.",

The conductive probability of PNCs is gradually enhanced with the increase of NR stiffness in the quiescent state; however, it first increases and then decreases under the shear field. As a result, the largest conductive probability appears at moderate NR stiffness, which results from the competition between the improved effective aspect ratio of the NR and the breakage of the conductive network. Meanwhile, compared with in the quiescent state, under the shear field the decrease or the increase of the conductive probability depends on the NR stiffness. At low NR stiffness, the increase of the effective aspect ratio of NR enhances the conductive probability, while at high NR stiffness, the breakage of the conductive network reduces the conductive probability. For flexible NRs, the conductive probability first increases and then decreases with increasing the shear rate. The maximum effective aspect ratio of NRs appears at the moderate shear rate, which is consistent with the conductive probability. In summary, this work presents some further understanding about how NR stiffness affects the electric conductive properties of PNCs under the shear field.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The achievement of low rolling resistance and long-term durability of tires on various vehicles is of great challenge. Tire performances heavily depend on rubber properties; however, the thermo-mechanical coupling characteristics of rubber composites are complicated rendering the design of high-performance tires time-consuming and costly. In our research, the transient temperature and rolling resistance of a solid rubber tire were performed based on the thermo-mechanical coupling approach and nonlinear viscoelastic theory by using finite element method. Particular attention was paid to the strain cycles as the tire rolling on the road presents non-sinusoidal deformation. First, a static three dimensional tire-road contact analysis was conducted to obtain the principal strain cycles. Second, the 100 th -order Fourier sine series was used to approximate the strain amplitude. Third, the heat generation rate proportional to the product of the loss modulus and the square of strain amplitude was calculated. The loss modulus was updated as a function of strain amplitude, temperature and frequency. Loss modulus softening effect was also considered. A practical method was proposed to compute the rolling resistance and transient temperature distributions by establishing a 2-D axisymmetric model. A rubber rolling tester was used to verify the numerical results. The comparison between numerical data and test data reveals that the proposed analytical method is a reliable approach to predict rolling resistance and transient temperature distribution for rubber tires. At last, the dependence of rolling resistance and heat build-up on thermal conductivity and loss factor were investigated by the parametric numerical experiments.",

        "abstract": "By adopting coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation, we investigate the effects of end-functionalization and shear flow on the destruction and recovery of a nanorod conductive network in a functionalized polymer matrix. We find that the end-functionalization of polymeric chains can enhance the electrical conductivity of nanorod filled polymer nanocomposites, indicated by the decrease of the percolation threshold. However, there exists an optimal end-functionalization extent to reach the maximum electrical conductivity. In the case of steady shear flow, both homogeneous conductive probability and directional conductive probability perpendicular to the shear direction decrease with the shear rate, while the directional conductive probability parallel to the shear direction increases. Importantly, we develop a semi-empirical equation to describe the change of the homogeneous conductive probability as a function of the shear rate. Meanwhile, we obtain an empirical formula describing the relationship between the anisotropy of the conductive probability and the orientation of the nanorods. In addition, the conductivity stability increases with increasing nanorod volume fraction. During the recovery process of the nanorod conductive network, it can be fitted well by the model combining classical percolation theory and a time-dependent nanorod aggregation kinetic equation. The fitted recovery rate is similar for different nanorod volume fractions. In summary, this work provides some rational rules for fabricating polymer nanocomposites with excellent performance of electrical conductivity. ",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Based on nonlinear viscoelastic theory and coupled thermo-mechanical approach, heat build-up analysis of a rubber specimen under cyclic loading was performed through finite element analysis. The determination of the rubber material properties attracted particular attention. The thermo-mechanical coupling approach can be divided into three major parts: deformation, dissipation, and thermal modules. In the deformation module, uniaxial, planar, and equibiaxial tensile tests were used to determine the hyperelastic constitutive equation. In the dissipation module, an analytical method for calculating the energy dissipation rate was established. The dynamic properties were updated as a function of the strain and temperature based on the modified Kraus model. Creep effect and dynamic property softening effect on the viscoelastic properties were firstly considered. In the thermal module, the dependence of thermal parameters on temperature was established. A highly sophisticated equipment which can measure the temperature rise curves both on the surface and at the heart of the rubber specimen was used to verify the calculated results. The comparison between numerical results and experimental data shows that the proposed analysis method provides a satisfactory way to predict heat build-up for rubber compounds.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Facilitating the electric field to fabricate high performance polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) is always a great and promising strategy. In this work, the effect of the electric field on the conductive property of the PNCs is investigated by adopting coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation. The translational and rotational diffusion of the nanorod gradually decreases with the increase of the nanorod aspect ratio; however, it is nearly independent of the nanorod volume fraction. Under the electric field, it exhibits a limited decrease, but more anisotropy of the translational diffusion of the nanorod. Meanwhile, the nanorods can not experience the random rotation, which is attributed to the electrostatic force. In addition, on one hand, the electrostatic force exerting on the nanorods induces the nanorod orientation, leading to the decrease of the homogeneous conductive probability; however, the electrostatic interaction induces the connection of the nanorod, resulting in the increase of the homogeneous conductive probability. Additionally, the directional conductive probability parallel to the electric field direction increases; however, the directional conductive probability perpendicular to the electric field direction shows a continuous decrease. Considering these two effects, the decrease or the increase of the homogeneous conductivity probability depends on the competition between the electrostatic force and the electrostatic interaction. The relationship among the anisotropy of the conductive probability, the nanorod volume fraction, the electrostatic force and the electrostatic interaction can be described quantitatively by an empirical formula. Another empirical formula is adopted to quantitatively describe the relationship among the percolation threshold, the electrostatic force and the electrostatic interaction. Meanwhile, the evolution process of the conductivity network structure is studied with or without the electric field. In summary, this work quantitatively describes the effect of the electric field on the conductive property of the PNCs, which can provide some useful guidances to design and fabricate PNCs with excellent conductivity properties by taking advantage of the external electric field.",

        "abstract": "Grafting chains on the surface of a filler is an effective strategy to tune and control the filler conductive network, which can be utilized to fabricate polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) with high electrical conductivity. In this work, by employing the coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation, we investigated the effect of polymer-grafted nanorods (NRs) on the conductive probability of PNCs in the quiescent state or under the shear field for different volume fractions of the NRs. The local order structure of the NRs aggregating in the matrix is gradually broken down, and the dispersion state of the NRs improves with increasing grafting density. However, at high grafting densities, the uniform dispersion of the NRs leads to a large NR-NR distance. As a result, the conductive probability first increases and then decreases with the increase of the grafting density. Under the shear field, the conductive probability shows a continuous increase with the grafting density. Compared with that in the quiescent state, the decrease or the increase of the conductive probability depends on the grafting density under the shear field. In particular, the smallest change in the percolation threshold appears at the highest grafting density, which reflects the high conductive stability. In addition, the topological structure of the conductive network nearly remains unchanged with the length of the grafted chain. Finally, compared with the strong attractive interaction between grafted chains and free chains, weakly repulsive interactions can effectively enhance the conductive probability.",

        "abstract": "Through coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation, we have successfully designed the chemically cross-linked (fixed junction) and the slide-ring (SR) systems. Firstly, we examine the dynamic properties such as the mean-square displacement, the bond, and the end-to-end autocorrelation functions as a function of the cross-linking density, consistently pointing out that the SR system exhibits much lower mobility compared with the fixed junction one at the same cross-linking density. This is further validated by a relatively higher glass transition temperature for the SR system compared with that of the fixed junction one. Then, we calculated the effect of the cross-linking density on the stretch-recovery behavior for the SR and fixed junction systems. Although the chain orientation of the SR system is higher than that of the fixed-junction system, the tensile stress is smaller than the latter. We infer that much greater chain sliding can occur during the stretch, because the movable ring structure homogeneously sustains the external force of the SR system, which, therefore, leads to much larger permanent set and higher hysteresis during the recovery process compared with the fixed-junction one. Based on the stretch-recovery behavior for various cross-linking densities, we obtain the change of the hysteresis loss, which is larger for the SR system than that of the fixed junction system. Lastly, we note that the relatively bigger compressive stress for the SR system results from the aggregation of the rigid rings compared with the fixed junction system. In general, compared with the traditionally cross-linked system, a deep molecular-level insight into the slide-ring polymer network is offered and thus is believed to provide some guidance to the design and preparation of the slide-ring polymer network with both good mechanical and damping properties.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   It is very important to simultaneously improve the electrical conductivities of polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) under the quiescent state and under the shear field, which can widen their application. For this purpose, in this work, by adopting a coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation, the effect of the hybrid nanofillers (rod filler and X filler) on the conductive probability of PNCs under the quiescent state and under the shear field has been investigated in details, which aims to reach their optimization. By analyzing the conductive network, it is found that the conductive probability gradually decreases with the increase of the volume fraction ratio of X filler to all the filler (    \u03b1    ) under the quiescent state, which is strongly related to the mean square radius of gyration of nanofiller. Under the shear field, the conductive probability first increases and then saturates with the increase of     \u03b1    . It is interesting to observe the optimization of the conductive probabilities under the quiescent state and under the shear field at     \u03b1     equal to 0.50. As a result, compared with in the quiescent state, the decrease or the increase of the conductive probability depends on     \u03b1    . Last, the conductive network of hybrid fillers is found to be kept very well even at high shear rate. In summary, this work presents that hybrid nanofillers (rod filler and X filler) are actually the suitable candidate to optimize the electrical conductivities of PNCs under the quiescent state and under the shear field.",

        "abstract": "Detailed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations are performed to investigate the structural and mechanical properties of nanoparticles (NPs) grafted with an amphiphilic AB diblock copolymer, with the A-block being compatible with NPs and the B-block being miscible with a homopolymer matrix. We systematically investigate the effects of the grafting density (Ng), the component ratio (\u03b1) and the flexibility of the grafted diblock copolymer on the structural and mechanical properties of polymer nanocomposites (PNCs). Interestingly, we observe that the grafted NPs can form a core-shell like structure attributed to the adsorption of the A-blocks onto the NPs, validated by the radial distribution function of the A and B blocks away from the surface of the NPs. The integrity of the core-shell structure is influenced by the grafting density and the component ratio of the grafted chains. The core-shell structure of the NPs becomes more perfect with greater Ng. The morphology of the NPs is shifted from a network structure to an isolated or well dispersed state upon increasing the grafting density. Meanwhile, we analyze the evolution of the morphology of the NPs during the uniaxial tensile process by calculating the number of neighboring NPs as a function of strain, thus finding that the NP network is broken-up at low grafting density, while only a little change is observed at high grafting density. Upon increasing the component ratio of the B-block to the A-block, the dispersion of the NPs becomes better, characterized by the radial distribution function of NPs-NPs, NPs-A-blocks, NPs-B-blocks, NPs-matrix, the number of neighboring NPs and the snapshots. Lastly, by changing the B-block from being flexible to stiff, the core-shell structure of the NPs disappears after the formation of a typical capsule morphology. This capsule-ordered structure becomes more prominent with the increase in Ng. Remarkably, compared to the effect of the core-shell morphology on the mechanical properties, the capsule morphology reinforces the mechanical properties more obviously. In general, this simulation work provides a deep insight into the structural and mechanical properties of NPs grafted with diblock copolymer chains, in the hope of providing some guidance on the design and preparation of high-performance PNCs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this work, a novel strategy to avoid the blooming of antioxidants and improve the aging-resistance of styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) was proposed by using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) loaded with antioxidant N-(1, 3-dimethyl) butyl-N\u2032-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (4020) as filler. The sustained release of antioxidant from carbon nanotubes extends its action time. The amount of antioxidant in the rubber composites allows for a concentration of 2.0\u00a0wt.% without causing blooming by encapsulating antioxidant into carbon nanotubes. The aging resistance of SBR/CNTs composites was studied by comparing the mechanical properties before and after thermal-oxidative and ozone aging. A fifteen-day thermal-oxidative aging test at 100\u00a0\u00b0C shows preservation of mechanical properties and a twenty-four-hour ozone aging test shows no cracks. Furthermore, due to the present of thermal and electrical conductive carbon nanotubes, the rubber composites emerge thermal conductivity of 0.303\u00a0W/m\u00b7K and electrical conductivity of 4.74\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 7 \u00a0\u03a9\u00b7cm which can be extended for many potential applications, such as long service life tires and antistatic conveyer belts. This loading and sustained release approach can be extended to antimicrobial, antifouling, and other application.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   It is very important to improve the electrical conductivity of polymer nanocomposites (PNCs), which can be used under the external field. In this work, by employing a coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation, the effect of the external fields (tensile field and shear field) on the conductive probability of PNCs has been investigated in details by tuning the nanofiller shape. By carefully analyzing the conductive network, compared with the rod filler and the sphere filler, the Y filler and the X filler can protect the conducive networks well from their breakage perpendicular to the external fields, which thus can significantly enhance the conductive probability under the external fields. In other words, compared with under the quiescent state, the decrease or the increase of the conductive probability under the external fields depends on the nanofiller shape. Meanwhile, it is interesting to find that both the directional conductive probabilities parallel to the shear field and perpendicular to the shear field increase with the shear rate for the Y fillers, which further reflects their high conductive probability under the shear field. The reason can be attributed to two aspects: (1) the gradual aggregation of Y fillers under the external field; (2) the multi-arm structures of Y fillers. In summary, this work presents some further understanding how to improve the electrical conductivity of PNCs under the external fields by tuning the nanofiller shape.",

MD simulation found that the AO-80/NBR/PVC composite (abbreviated as AO-80/NBVC) with an AO-80 content of 99 phr had the largest hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) and highest binding energy, indicating a good compatibility between NBR and AO-80 and good damping performance of AO-80/NBVC composites. Experimental results from SEM, DSC, and DMA were in good agreement with the MD simulation results. The tensile test results showed that the AO-80/NBVC composite with an AO-80 content of 99 phr had high tensile strength because of the strong H-bonds of the composites and the disintegration and reintegration of the H-bonds. The MD simulation technique proves to be a promising tool for the design and prediction of high damping properties of advanced composites in a microscopic view.",

        "abstract": "Graphene/solution-polymerized styrene-butadiene rubber (SSBR) composites were prepared by using three types of SSBR matrix with different vinyl contents. The dynamic properties, interfacial bonding characteristics, and fractional free volume (FFV) of the composites were studied through a combined experimental and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approach. We found that as the vinyl content increases in the SSBR matrix, the grapheme/SSBR interfacial interaction increases, the FFV decreases, and the graphene dispersion is improved. The interfacial interaction, which is derived from the introduction of graphene, can increase the activation energy and limit the mobility of the SSBR chains. Additionally, MD simulations of the pullout of the graphene from SSBR matrix were carried out to explore the interfacial bonding characteristics at the molecular level, which show that the interaction energy, pullout energy, and shear stress between graphene and SSBR increase with the increase of the vinyl content. The modeling results were in good agreement with the experimental results. This present study is expected to deepen the understanding of the basic physics for graphene reinforced rubber nanocomposites, especially the interfacial bonding characteristics at the molecular level.",

The computed results revealed that four types of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), namely, type A (AO-70) \u2013OH\u22efNC\u2013 (NBR), type B (AO-70) \u2013OH\u22efOC\u2013 (AO-70), and type C (AO-70) \u2013OH\u22efOH\u2013 (AO-70), type D (AO-70) \u2013OH\u22efO\u2013C\u2013 (AO-70) were formed in the AO-70/NBR composites, where type A was the most stable. Meanwhile, the AO-70/NBR composite with AO-70 content of 109 phr had the largest number of H-bonds, highest binding energy, and smallest fractional free volume (FFV), demonstrating a good compatibility between NBR and AO-70 and the best damping property of the composites. The experimental results were highly consistent with the MD simulation results, which means the combining methods can provide a new attempt for the design of optimum damping materials.",

        "abstract": "In this study, influences of hybrid filler networks of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon black (CB) on fracture resistance of styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) composites were well investigated. The spherical CB was partially substituted by fibrous CNTs in two different ways: unequal replacement (1 phr CNTs replacing 4 phr CB) and equal replacement (1 phr CNTs replacing 1 phr CB). The J-integral tests were employed to evaluate the crack initiation and propagation resistance. The strain amplification and distribution near the crack tip was measured by digital image correlation to explore the fracture resistance mechanism. Results revealed that the fracture resistance was effectively improved by unequal replacement. Meanwhile, for unequal replacement, higher content of CNTs resulted in a weaker strain amplification factor and larger amplification area near the crack tip, which contributed to the improved fracture resistance. However, opposite trends were observed for equal replacement. A synergistic effect in fracture resistance of SBR composites between CB and CNTs was realized for unequal replacement. POLYM. ENG.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) was used to observe the variations of internal groups before and after the thermo-oxidative aging. Magnetic resonance-crosslink density (MR-XLD) spectroscopy was used to measure the crosslink densities. The results showed the compressive stress relaxation of BR during thermo-oxidative aging was dominated by chemical reactions: crosslinking, chain scission, and oxidation. Then an empirical model and an amendatory standard linear solid (SLS) model were put forward to describe the compressive stress relaxation behavior of BR. Both models fitted the data well. The SLS model, based on the aging mechanism of BR, not only made up the disadvantages of the empirical model, but also considered the changes of intrinsic viscosity (\u03b7) during the thermo-oxidative aging of BR. The SLS model showed that the thermo-oxidative aging of BR was mainly dominated by the crosslinking and oxidation reactions. This research proposes the amendatory SLS model and has important significance for study the stress relaxation behavior of cross-linked rubbers during thermo-oxidative aging. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "abstract": "Achieving energy sustainability has imposed a great challenge to improve fuel efficient vehicles. Tires, to overcome the rolling resistance, are responsible for a rather large fraction of energy consumed by vehicles, and a 10% reduction in the rolling resistance corresponds to a 2% decline in the fuel consumption, which, for instance, would save 1\u20132 billion gallon of fuel per year consumed by the entire passenger vehicle fleet in the United States. From the materials\u2019 perspective, the key bottleneck to lower the rolling resistance of tires lies in designing a novel kind of advanced elastomeric polymer nanocomposites tailored for tire tread, with remarkably low dynamic hysteresis loss (DHL). Here we show that, a nanoparticle chemically end-linking elastomer network, with nanoparticles (NPs) acting as netpoints to chemically connect the dual end-groups of each polymer chain to form a network, exhibits excellent static and dynamic mechanical properties of super-low DHL. The DHL is reduced for ~50% compared to silica NPs filled elastomer that is conventionally used for tire tread. By taking advantage of a library of other nanomaterials such as functionalized carbon nanotube and graphene, our approach provides a versatile framework to fabricate the fuel-saving tires, opening up valuable opportunities for large-scale industrial applications of these nanomaterials in the tire industry.",

Herein, through coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation, we build six different chain architectures namely linear, branch-2 (with two side chains), branch-4 (with four side chains), branch-10 (with ten side chains), star-4 (with four arms) and star-6 (with six arms), by fixing the molecular weight per chain. First, we examine the effect of the interfacial interaction between the polymer and nanoparticles (NPs) \u03b5 on the dispersion of NPs, by calculating the radial distribution function between NPs, the second virial coefficient and the average number of neighbor fillers. We observe a non-monotonic change of the NP dispersion as a function of \u03b5 for all PNCs with different chain architectures, indicating the optimal dispersion of NPs at moderate \u03b5. Meanwhile, we find that the star-6, branch-4 and linear chains promote the best dispersion of NPs at moderate \u03b5, compared to the other chain architectures. Then we investigate the strain hardening behavior and chain orientation of these PNCs under uniaxial tension. We find that the star-6 chains demonstrate relatively the most remarkable reinforced mechanical behavior of PNCs. Furthermore, we probe the effect of end-functionalization of polymer chains with different architectures on the dispersion of NPs, by comparing them to the case without any functionalization. We find that the introduction of the end-functionalization benefits mostly the high degree of chain branching for promoting the dispersion of NPs. Meanwhile, we observe that when the tensile strain is small, the branch-4 structure shows relatively improved mechanical properties, however, when the tensile strain is large, the star-6 and branch-10 structures display the best mechanical properties, and the end-functionalization evidently improves the mechanical properties of the PNCs. Our simulation results provide guidelines to tailor the dispersion of NPs and the mechanical properties of PNCs, by taking advantage of the chain architecture and its end-functionalization strategy.",

        "abstract": "Using short polymer chains and through molecular dynamics simulation, we designed a well-dispersed nanoparticle (NP) network, which was then incorporated with the polymer matrix. First, we examined the effects of the dual-end grafted chains flexibility and density on the spatial distribution of this particular polymer nanocomposites system. By changing the interaction strength between the matrix polymer chains and the dual-end grafted chains in the semi-interpenetrating network system (NP network), we analyzed the interpenetration state between the linear polymer matrix and the NP network via calculating the total interfacial interaction energy. Moreover, the uniaxial tensile stress-strain and orientation behavior influenced by the interaction strength between the matrix polymer and the grafted chains were investigated for both the semi-interpenetrating network system and the interpenetrating network system (NP network and matrix network). Furthermore, for the interpenetrating network system, we modulated the integrity of the NP network ranging from 0% to 100%, corresponding to the gradual transition of the dispersion morphology of the NPs from the aggregation state to the uniform dispersion state, to examine the effect of the NP network on the tensile mechanical behavior. In particular, by simulating the dynamic shear process in the semi-interpenetrating network system, the composites were found to exhibit a lower non-linear behavior (the famous Payne effect), a higher storage modulus, and a lower tangent loss at large strain amplitude with increasing NP network integrity. In general, our results could provide a new approach for the design of high-performance polymer nanocomposites by taking advantage of the semi-interpenetrating or interpenetrating network reinforcing structure.",

        "abstract": "Designing a multiple-network structure at the molecular level to tailor the mechanical properties of polymeric materials is of great scientific and technological importance. Through the coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation, we successfully construct an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) composed of a flexible polymer network and a stiff polymer network. First, we find that there is an optimal chain stiffness for a single network (SN) to achieve the best stress-strain behavior. Then we turn to study the mechanical behaviors of IPNs. The result shows that the stress-strain behaviors of the IPNs appreciably exceed the sum of that of the corresponding single flexible and stiff network, which highlights the advantage of the IPN structure. By systematically varying the stiffness of the stiff polymer network of the IPNs, optimal stiffness also exists to achieve the best performance. We attribute this to a much larger contribution of the non-bonded interaction energy. Last, the effect of the component concentration ratio is probed. With the increase of the concentration of the flexible network, the stress-strain behavior of the IPNs is gradually enhanced, while an optimized concentration (around 60% molar ration) of the stiff network occurs, which could result from the dominant role of the enthalpy rather than the entropy. In general, our work is expected to provide some guidelines to better tailor the mechanical properties of the IPNs made of a flexible network and a stiff network, by manipulating the stiffness of the stiff polymer network and the component concentration ratio.",

        "abstract": "Realizing and manipulating a fine dispersion of silica nanoparticles (NPs) in the polymer matrix is always a great challenge. In this work, we firstly successfully synthesized N, N'-bis[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl-isopropanol] -propane-1, 3-diamine (TSPD), which was a new interface modifier, aiming to promote the dispersion of silica NPs. Through the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance analyses (NMR) and mass spectroscopy, we verified that the TSPD contains together six ethoxy groups at its two ends. Then, we used this TSPD to modify the pure silica NPs and this modified silica was abbreviated as D-MS, which is realized by the TGA examination, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses and dynamic light scattering (DLS) results. It was clearly observed that D-MS NPs are connected to one another but are not conglutinated tightly, exhibiting a novel pre-dispersed structure with around 1-2 nm certain extent of inter-particle distance. Next, we fabricated the following four elastomer nanocomposites such as pure silica/natural rubber (NR) composite (PS-NR), D-MS/NR composite (DMS-NR), bis-(\u03b3-triethoxysilylpropyl)-tetrasulfide (TESPT) modified silica/NR composite (TS-NR) and TESPT modified D-MS/NR composite (T&DMS-NR), and found that the Payne effect is the smallest for T&DMS-NR via the combination use of the D-MS and the traditional coupling agent TESPT, attributed to its best dispersion state evidenced by the TEM results. Moreover, by measuring a series of other important mechanical performances such as the stress-strain curve, the dynamic strain dependent of the loss factor and the heat build-up, the T&DMS-NR system greatly exceeds those of the three other rubber composites. In general, this new approach provides a good opportunity to prepare a silica/rubber composite with excellent properties in mechanics strength and dynamic behavior by tailoring the fine dispersion of NPs.",

        "abstract": "By adopting coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, the effect of polymer functionalization on the relationship between the microstructure and the electric percolation probability of nanorod filled polymer nanocomposites has been investigated. At a low chain functionalization degree, the nanorods in the polymer matrix form isolated aggregates with a local order structure. At a moderate chain functionalization degree, the local order structure of the nanorod aggregate is gradually broken up. Meanwhile, excessive functionalization chain beads can connect the isolated aggregates together, which leads to the maximum size of nanorod aggregation. At a high chain functionalization degree, it forms a single nanorod structure in the matrix. As a result, the highest percolation probability of the materials appears at the moderate chain functionalization degree, which is attributed to the formation of the tightly connected nanorod network by analyzing the main cluster. In addition, this optimum chain functionalization degree exists at two chain functionalization modes (random and diblock). Lastly, under the tensile field, even though the contact distance between nanorods nearly remains unchanged, the topological structure of the percolation network is broken down. While under the shear field, the contact distance between nanorods increases and the topological structure of the percolation network is broken down, which leads to a decrease in the percolation probability. In total, the topological structure of the percolation network dominates the percolation probability, which is not a necessary connection with the contact distance between nanorods. In summary, this work presents further understanding of the electric conductive properties of nanorod-filled nanocomposites with functionalized polymers.",

To this end, we firstly validated the accuracy of this method, and affirmed that the produced stress-strain characteristics were qualitatively consistent with Lesser's experimental results on the prestretched tri-block copolymers with a competitive double network. Secondly, we investigated the effect of the crosslinking network ratio on the mechanical properties of the prestretched double network homopolymers under uniaxial tension. We found that the prestretched double network contributes greatly to the enhanced tensile stress and ultimate strength at fracture, as well as to the lower permanent set (the residual strain) and dynamic hysteresis loss, both parallel and perpendicular to the prestretching direction. Notably, though, an anisotropic behavior was observed: in the parallel direction, both the first and the second crosslinked networks bore the external force; whereas in the perpendicular direction, only the second crosslinked network was relevantly effective. Finally, the polymer nanocomposites with a prestretched double network exhibited tensile mechanical properties similar to those of the studied homopolymers with prestretched double networks. Summing up the results, it can be concluded that the incorporation of prestretched double networks with a specified crosslinking network ratio seems to be a promising method for manipulating the mechanical properties of elastomers and their nanocomposites, as well as for introducing anisotropy in their mechanical response.",

        "abstract": "Establishing the Time-Temperature and Frequency-Temperature Superposition Principles (TTSP and FTSP) to describe the mechanical behavior of polymeric materials is always of paramount significance. In this work, by adopting the classic coarse-grained model, we investigate the validity of these superposition principles for a series of networks, such as the pure polymer network, interpenetrating polymer networks composed of stiff and flexible networks (IPNs-SF), interpenetrating polymer networks composed of different cross-linking networks (IPNs-DC), polymer nanocomposites (PNCs), and surface grafted modified PNCs. The study focuses on the three critical mechanical properties such as the stress relaxation, the storage modulus versus the frequency obtained from the dynamic periodic shear deformation, and the uniaxial tensile stress-strain. The glass transition temperature (T) is about 0.47 for the simulated polymer network (CL400), and a smooth master curve is obtained for the stress relaxation process by setting the reference temperature T = 0.6 via the horizontal shifting process, indicating the validity of TTSP. Furthermore, similar smooth master curves are also achieved for both dynamic periodic shear and uniaxial tensile deformation, which exhibit similar trends and share the identical linear viscoelastic regime in the temperature interval above T: 0.55<T<1.0. Importantly, the Williams-Landel-Ferry and Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann equations are both adopted to quantitatively analyze non-linear TTSP behavior when the temperature approaches T. For the three mechanical properties, we emphasize that the master curve from TTSP or FTSP is independent of the reference temperature if it is higher than T, and based on the linear relation of the shift factor versus the inverse of the temperature higher than T, we propose a universal framework for the description of the TTSP or FTSP on the various mechanical properties. Then, we verify that the TTSP seems to be valid for the IPNs-DC system, while it does not hold for both PNCs and IPNs-SF systems because of their structural and dynamic heterogeneity. Furthermore, for PNCs filled with NPs grafted with polymer chains, the TTSP recovers back to be valid because of the enhanced compatibility between polymer and NPs attributed to the grafted polymer chains.",

        "abstract": "The matrix-free polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) formed by polymer-grafted nanoparticles(NPs) gain enormous attention due to their controllable morphology and robust properties. Herein, through molecular dynamics simulation, such PNCs are successfully constructed, and the dispersion state of the NPs can be tailored by varying the grafting density. By manipulating the interaction strength between the end groups of the grafted polymer chains, the tensile fracture behavior and the chain orientation are examined. It is revealed that both of them fall down at large strain because of the propagation of the cavities. By probing the self-healing kinetics at various self-healing temperature and time, a time-temperature superposition principle, similar to the Williams, Landel and Ferry equation, is proposed. These results could provide some fundamental guidelines for the design and fabrication of high performance PNCs with excellent self-healing functionality.",

        "abstract": "Tuning the viscoelasticity of polymeric materials by incorporating nanoparticles (NPs) has received considerable scientific and technological interests. Contrary to increasing the energy dissipation for damping materials, here we direct our attention to study how to decrease the energy dissipation of elastomer nanocomposites (ENCs) under periodic dynamic loading\u2013unloading cycles. Through molecular dynamics simulation, we firstly simulate the pure cis-polybutadiene (cis-PB) system, by calculating the mean-squared end-to-end distance and the radius of gyration as a function of the chain length, the diffusion coefficient of polymer chains as a function of the temperature, the glass transition temperature, the stress\u2013strain curves at different strain rates and temperatures, the tension\u2013recovery and compression\u2013recovery curves at various cross-linking densities. These results validate the accuracy of the united atom model and force-field of cis-PB. Then we show that the incorporation of flexible nanoparticles (NPs) such as graphene nanoribbons and carbon nanotubes can effectively decrease the dynamic hysteresis loss, by taking advantage of the reversible mechanical deformation of the anisotropic NPs. This effect can be further strengthened by the stronger interfacial interaction, higher loading and larger size of this kind of NPs. The underlying reason stems from the synergistic motion between the NPs and their surrounding polymer chains, leading to much smaller internal friction. This work may open up potential opportunities to fabricate high-performance polymer nanocomposites, such as energy-saving ENCs tailored for tire tread.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Despite a large amount of work have been carried out to prepare polymer/graphene hybrid nanocomposites, preparing rubber composites filled with graphene oxide via layer-by-layer (LBL) electrostatic self-assembly has not yet been reported. In this work, free-standing conductive multilayer film of (PEI/XNBR/PEI/GO) 30  (30 is referred to the number of deposition cycles) was fabricated on glass substrate through alternative LBL self-assembly with graphene oxide (GO), carboxylic acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (XNBR) latex, and polyethyleneimine (PEI). During the self-assembly process, negatively charged carboxyl groups on XNBR latex and GO sheets can be electrostatically bound by positively charged amino groups from PEI molecules. After thermal treatment, XNBR latex particles in each layer are gradually mixed together and became a continuous rubber film layer, and partial ionic bonds among XNBR latex, PEI and GO sheets are changed into covalent amide bonds. The formation of the multilayer XNBR/graphene film with ordered arrangement of GO sheets and XNBR latex layers was demonstrated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The obtained XNBR/graphene film exhibited a significant improvement in mechanical properties, namely, 192% increase of the tensile strength and 215% increase of the elastic modulus. Besides, electrical conductivity of the prepared multilayer film reached 8.2E-03\u00a0S\u00a0cm \u22121  after thermal reduced reaction. Hopefully, this prepared multilayer film may be potentially used as an elastomeric conductive material.",

Through the coarse-grained model, the nonlinear decrease of the elastic modulus (G\u2032) and the maximum of the viscous modulus (G\u2033) around the shear strain of 10% is clearly reproduced. By turning to the polybutadiene model, we examine the effect of the shear amplitude and the interaction strength among uniform NPs on the aggregation kinetics. Interestingly, the change of the G\u2032 as a function of the aggregation time exhibited a maximum value at intermediate time attributed to the formation of a polymer-bridged filler network in the case of strong interaction between NPs.

        "abstract": "We adopted molecular dynamics simulation to study the conductive property of nanorod-filled polymer nanocomposites by focusing on the effects of the interfacial interaction, aspect ratio of the fillers, external shear field, filler-filler interaction and temperature. The variation of the percolation threshold is anti N-type with increasing interfacial interaction. It decreases with an increase in the aspect ratio. At an intermediate filler-filler interaction, a minimum percolation threshold appears. The percolation threshold decreases to a plateau with temperature. At low interfacial interaction, the effect of an external shear field on the homogeneous probability is negligible; however, the directional probability increases with shear rate. Moreover, the difference in conductivity probabilities is reduced for different interfacial interactions under shear. Under shear, the decrease or increase of conductivity probability depends on the initial dispersion state. However, the steady-state conductivity is independent of the initial state for different interfacial interactions. In particular, the evolution of the conductivity network structure under shear is investigated. In short, this study may provide rational tuning methods to obtain nanorod-filled polymer nanocomposites with high conductivity. ",

Due to the presence of itaconate in copolyesters, it can be readily crosslinked by peroxide into a crystallizable network. The structure and thermal properties of PBISI copolyesters were determined by H NMR, FTIR, DSC, and WAXD. The chain composition, melting point and crystallinity of the PBISI copolyesters can be tuned continuously by changing the content of isosorbide. The crosslinked copolyester is demonstrated to be a promising shape memory polymer (SMP) with excellent shape memory properties including shape fixity and shape recovery rate close to 100%. The switching temperatures of PBISI-based SMPs can be tuned between 26 \u00b0C and 54 \u00b0C by altering the composition of PBISI copolyesters and curing extent. Cell adhesion and proliferation were adopted to evaluate the potential biocompatibility of PBISI-based SMPs, and the results indicated that all the PBISI-based SMPs were essentially noncytotoxic, making them suitable for fabricating biomedical devices.",

While, in spite of the recently renowned advances in this field, the mechanism of synergistic behavior in the system is still unclear and equivocal. In this study, we systematically investigated the mechanism for the synergistic reinforcement in an elastomer reinforced by nanocarbon hybrids consisting of 2D reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The improved dispersion state of hybrid filler was attested by Raman, UV-Vis spectra and morphological observations. In addition to the phenomenological evidences, we substantiated a stronger confinement effect of hybrid network on chain dynamics, for the first time, with molecular concepts by dielectric relaxation analysis. The formation of a glassy interphase with orders of magnitude slower chain dynamics than that for bulk chains has been explicitly demonstrated in the hybrid system. Besides improved dispersion upon hybridization, it is believed the formation of a glassy interphase is another crucial factor in governing the synergistic reinforcement capability of hybrid composites. We envision this new finding provides significant insight into the mechanism of synergistic behavior in hybrid-filled polymer composites with molecular concepts. ",

In the present work, we propose a generic mechanochemical grafting strategy to prepare the organo-soluable CNTs, which is facile, efficient, and scalable. Significantly, the solvent spectrum of the CNTs suspension can be simply extended by changing the chemical composition of the grafted elastomer chains. The prospect of the organo-solubale CNTs is demonstrated by the free-standing buckypapers by direct filtration of the CNT colloids. Such buckypapers exhibit great potential as robust and ultraflexible conductors due to the combination of high toughness and stable conductivity under cyclic bending and twisting. Furthermore, this facile surface modification strategy of CNTs also enables remarkable improvement in mechanical properties of CNT-based rubber composites. We envision that the present work offers a facile yet efficient strategy for scalable production of organosoluable CNTs and other nanoparticles, which is of great scientific and technological interest.",

Despite essential progress in these areas, a summary and discussion of state-of-the-art strategies for regulating the transport performances of nanocomposites based on the transportation mechanisms of electrons, phonons and mass are lacking. In the present review, a brief introduction of transport mechanisms in elastomer nanocomposites precedes a systematic summary of the important progress in elastomer nanocomposites with electrical/thermal conductivities and lowered mass permeabilities, with emphasis on the latest structural control strategies for tuning transport properties. Key applications of functional elastomer nanocomposites related to transport phenomena are also introduced.

However, traditional undeformable spherical fillers have approached a bottleneck in regulating the viscoelasticity and lowering the hysteresis loss. Herein, the designed covalent interface in the graphene/elastomer nanocomposite maximizes the reinforcement of the nanomaterial as well as minimizes the dynamic energy loss. The reinforced interfacial interaction, an ultralow percolation threshold of tensile strength and high reinforcement synergistically benefit these nano-organized rubber nanocomposites. The energy losses under dynamic loading are largely suppressed in this material, due to the reduced nano-scale frictions. The developed graphene/elastomer nanocomposites are applied to typical dynamic rubber product - auto tires, and the tests indicate that these tires possess energy efficiency close to the highest \u201cA-grade\u201d, which gave great economic and environmental improvements. The critical role of interface structure in the performance of the elastomer nanocomposites was revealed and new design strategy for low dynamic energy losses in rubber products was suggested.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   It has been commonly acknowledged that particle dispersion and interfacial interactions are vital in determining the ultimate performance of polymer composites. However, the interplay between dispersibility and interfacial interaction in polymer composites has not been explicitly unraveled. In this contribution, a series of silica with controlled surface chemistry are prepared to reveal the effects of subtle change in surface property of filler on the structures and mechanical performance of the rubber composites. On the basis of thermodynamic theory, the dispersibility of modified silica in rubber is quantitatively evaluated by using surface energy. The modified silica was introduced into styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) to investigate the effects of surface modification on the dispersion of silica and interfacial interaction of the rubber composites. It has been demonstrated that subtle change in surface chemistry of silica drastically improves its dispersibility in rubber matrix, leading to much improved accessible surfaces and hence much complete interfacial reaction. At very low grafting content (0.2 molecule/nm 2 ), improved modulus (44%) and wet-traction (54%), together with reduced rolling-resistance (11%), are concurrently observed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The exploitation of generic strategy for preparation of conductive elastomer composites with interconnected filler network is of significant scientific and technical interests. Herein, we report a novel, green and effective strategy to prepare conductive natural rubber (NR) composites with interconnected graphene network structure. It is found that the Pickering emulsion template is effective in constructing 3D interconnected graphene oxide (GO) networks while the thermal treatment during hot pressing step is able to convert GO to conductive thermal reduced graphene (TRG). This strategy does not rely on the toxic and corrosive reducing agents and the adopted solvents in Pickering emulsions can be recycled and reused, which makes the process environmentally friendly. As a result, interconnected graphene network is well constructed within NR matrix, which significantly enhances the electrical conductivity, mechanical properties and lowers the percolation threshold of the resulted composites. Specifically, with the incorporation of 1.90\u202fvol% TRG, the electrical conductivity of NR composites with interconnected graphene network structure is more than 7 orders of magnitude higher than that of NR composites with uniform graphene dispersion. More intriguingly, this GO stabilized Pickering emulsion template strategy can also be used to realized the selective distribution of carbon nanotubes and assemble them into interconnected network structure, further facilitating the conductivity improvement of the resulted composites. Overall, we envision that the present work offers new insights into the design of conductive elastomer composites.",

As revealed by the XRD and morphological studies, TPG homogeneously dispersed in CSM matrix, which together with the strong interfacial interaction between TPG and CSM contribute to the remarkable improvement in mechanical properties of the resulted composites.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Surface modification of fillers has a profound influence on the dispersion of filler and interfacial adhesion, and thus the final performance of polymer-based composites. In this contribution, the modification of silica by polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS) is conducted via an efficient and fast tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane-catalyzed functionalization, which can be completed within a few minutes at room temperature. A highly hydrophobic surface and an uncompromised reactivity are concurrently observed in the modified silica. By comparison between the composites filled with pristine and modified silica, it is revealed that such PMHS modification can not only improve the dispersibility of silica by lowering the surface energy, but also enhance the interfacial interaction in virtue of the reactivity of the residual Si H bonds. With a PMHS grafting content as low as 1.5\u202fwt%, the modified composite exhibits tremendous improvements in mechanical properties (116% increase in modulus) and dynamic performances (116% increase in wet traction and 26% reduction in rolling resistance). Considering the superior overall performance of the modified composites, together with the simplicity and rapidity of the modification process, we envision that the hydrosilane-modified silica has great potential in the fabrication of high-performance polymer composites such as energy-saving tire treads.",

However, it remains challenging to control the distribution of graphene with a concise and efficient method though the past efforts have been made. In this contribution, we propose a novel hydrothermal self-assembled strategy in combination of the post-impregnation process to prepare highly conductive polymer/graphene composites. Specifically, styrene-butadiene rubber/graphene nanocomposites with a three-dimensional graphene network (3DG-SBR) were prepared by employing the hydrothermal self-assembling, followed by impregnating by silver nitrate. The resultant graphene/styrene-butadiene rubber/silver particle (3DG-SBR-Ag) nanocomposite with 1.66\u202fvol% of graphene exhibits the conductivity of 512\u202fS\u202fm \u22121 , which is competitive to those prepared by template-guided assembly strategy. Impressively, the polymer composite possesses mechanical robustness due to the strong interfacial reaction between graphene and polymer matrix. This synthetic approach for graphene-based nanocomposites is generic, scalable, flexibility in complex geometry and cost-effective. The as-prepared products could potentially be applied as competitive candidates for practical application in electromagnetic wave absorption and electromagnetic interference shielding.",

Accordingly, the prospectives and challenges of some real applications of graphene-based rubber composites such as tires and sensors are surveyed and discussed.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcing rubbers and expanding their application galleries are two important issues in material science and engineering. In this work, we demonstrate a bioinspired design of high-performance and macroscopically responsive diene-rubber by engineering sacrificial metal\u2013ligand motifs into a chemically cross-linked architecture network. The metal\u2013ligand bonds are formed through the coordination reaction between the pyridine groups in butadiene\u2013styrene\u2013vinylpyridine rubber (VPR) and metal ions. Under external load, the metal\u2013ligand bonds serve as sacrificial bonds that preferentially rupture prior to the covalent network, which dissipates energy and facilitates rubber chain orientation. Based on the function mechanisms, the modulus, tensile strength, and toughness of the samples are simultaneously improved without sacrificing the extensibility, and these properties can be conveniently tuned by varying the structure parameters of the covalently cross-linked network and metal\u2013ligand bonds. Moreover, the disso...",

        "abstract": "In silica-filled rubber composites, the silanization modification of silica plays a vital role in enhancing the compatibility between silica and a rubber matrix and hence the properties of the composites. In the present study, with the goal of promoting silanization reactivity and extent, we utilize a phosphonium ionic liquid (PIL) as a novel catalyst for the silanization reaction between silica and bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)-tetrasulfide (TESPT), a commonly used silane in the tire industry, in the styrene\u2013butadiene rubber (SBR) matrix. Dynamic rheological measurement, bound rubber measurement, freezing point depression, and heat capacity increment together show that the addition of a small amount of PIL into a TESPT-modified SBR/silica composite gives rise to significant improvement in the interfacial adhesion between silica and the rubber matrix, which is on account of the promoted silanization extent of silica with the catalyst of PIL. Consequently, the resulting composite prepared at room temperature...",

Then, 2 nm diameter carbon nanodots released from the halloysite lumens interacted with reactive radicals, generated at the initial stage of oxidative processes, which significantly improved thermo-aging resistance of the elastomers. The antioxidative efficiency of these CD-delivery vehicles was further increased through the nanotubes\u2019 surface modification with a thin grafted-silane shell, which allowed the slowing of the release rate, thus extending the protection. This nanoarchitectural design of the carbon dot-loaded clay nanotubes doped at 9 wt % into a rubber matrix allowed for sustained radical-scavenging and provides a new strategy for long-lasting elastomer protection.

        "abstract": "Rubbers are widely applied in tires, seals, biomedical materials and aerospace applications because of their unique high elasticity. However, combining high self-healing capability and excellent mechanical performance in a rubber remains a formidable challenge. In this work, inspired by the energy dissipation mechanism and the recoverability of sacrificial bonds, the authors describe a dual-dynamic network design of a high-performance elastomer in which weaker multiple hydrogen bonds and stronger Zn\u2013triazole coordination have been engineered into an unvulcanized cis-1,4-polyisoprene (IR) matrix. Accordingly, the elastomer obtains high tensile strength (21 MPa) and toughness (60 MJ m\u22123). The facilitated chain orientation in such a dual-dynamic network is finely substantiated by the molecular dynamics simulation results. Significantly, this dual-dynamic network design enables a fully cut elastomer to be healed at mild temperature. Under healing at 80 \u00b0C for 24 h, the healed elastomer regains excellent mechanical properties (tensile strength of 15.5 MPa and fracture energy of 42.8 MJ m\u22123). We envision that this design concept can not only develop a new network construction method in rubbers instead of vulcanization, but also provide inspiration for preparing advanced elastomers with the combination of excellent mechanical performance and high self-healing capability.",

Inspired by the multiphase structure of mussel byssus cuticles, we circumvent this dilemma by introducing deformable microphase-separated granule with rich coordination into a ductile rubber network. The granule can serve as additional cross-link to improve the modulus while the sacrificial, reversible coordination can dissociate and reconstruct continuously during stretching to dissipate energy. The elastomer with such bio-inspired multiphase structure exhibits over ten-fold increases in toughness compared to the original sample.

        "abstract": "In this work, nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the dispersion and spatial distribution of spherical nanoparticles (NPs) in polymer matrix under oscillatory shear flow. We systematically analyzed the influences of four important factors that consist of NP-polymer interfacial strength, volume fraction of NPs, shear conditions, and polymer chain length. The simulation results showed that the oscillatory shear can greatly improve the dispersion of NPs, especially for the polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) with high NP-polymer interfacial strength. Under specific shear conditions, the NPs can exhibit three different spatial distribution states with increasing the NP-polymer interfacial strength. Interestingly, at high interfacial strength, we observed that the NPs can be distributed on several layers in the polymer matrix, forming the PNCs with sandwich-like structures. Such well-ordered nanocomposites can exhibit a higher tensile strength than those with the NPs dispersed randomly. It may be expected that the information derived in present study provides a useful foundation for guiding the design and preparation of high-performance PNCs.",

        "abstract": "According to radiation protection theory, the radiation shielding properties of composites are closely related to dispersion condition of radiation absorbing materials in matrix. The more equably radiation-shielding materials dispersed in the matrix, the better the composites' shielding properties are. Rare earth ions have preferably absorbing ability for radiation due to their special electronic structures. From our early work, we know Sm(AA)3 has good radiation-absorbing ability and excellent compatibility with polymer matrix. Furthermore, Sm(AA)3 has double key structures which can in-situ react with polymer matrix in vulcanization process. This in-situ reaction can also help Sm(AA)3 disperse better in the matrix. Based on these, we studied a new method to prepare Sm(AA)3/NR(nature rubber) composites (NR used as matrix), in which Sm(AA), dispersed very equably with tiny particle size. Both sulfur and peroxide exist in the system as crosslinking agent. The vulcanization process occurred at the temperature of 110\u00b0C first and a certain degree crosslinking network formed in this stage, which we called pre-vulcanization process in this paper. In this stage sulfur was used as the crosslinking agent. Then continued the vulcanization process at higher temperature (170\u00b0C). The peroxide was used as crosslinking agent in this stage. According to reaction-induced phase decomposition mechanism, we studied the phase decomposition changing mode of Sm(AA)3 in NR matrix of different crosslinking degrees. We also studied the influence of different degrees of pre-vulcanization to the dispersion condition of Sm(AA)3 in NR matrix. The crystal-fusion status of both Sm(AA)3 powder and Sm(AA)3 in cured rubber were observed by DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) and XRD (X-rays Diffraction). The dispersion condition of Sm(AA)3 in cured rubber was observed by SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) and TEM (Transmission Electron Microscope). The study results show different degrees of pre-vulcanization have different effect on the in-situ reaction at high temperature (170\u00b0C), which influences the dispersion condition of Sm(AA)3 in NR matrix and the composites' final radiation-shielding properties directly.",

The influence of GO on the evolution of the filler network and crosslinking network of the composite during the fatigue process was investigated. Furthermore, the fatigue lifetimes of composites with different GO contents were obtained. The results showed that the GO sheets had a fine dispersion in the SBR matrix. The filler network constructed by GO and silica was improved after addition of the GO, resulting in the enhanced mechanical properties of the composites. During the fatigue process, the dispersion of GO and silica was enhanced, and the crosslinking density of the composites gradually decreased. S\u2013N curves showed that the fatigue lifetime of the composites was improved after the addition of GO. Strain energy density can be used as a predictor of fatigue lifetime for the GO/silica/SBR composites.",

The influence of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) on the fluorescence of Tb(acac)3phen/poly-L-lactic acid (Tb-complex, acac = acetylacetone; phen = phenanthroline, PLLA = poly-L-lactic acid) fibers was mainly investigated. It is found that Tb-complex dispersed in the fibers in the form of nanoclusters. The local field surrounding of Tb3+ ions was affected by the neighboring Ag-NPs. As a result of the LSPR effect of Ag-NPs, the fluorescence intensity, quantum efficiency of Tb-complex in the composite fibers with the Ag/Tb ratio of 4\u2006:\u20061, were simultaneously improved compared with the composite fibers without Ag-NPs.",

In this research, graphene oxide/butyl rubber (GO/IIR) composites were first prepared by a green method of latex compounding. This method achieved uniform dispersion of GO in IIR matrix for the GO content up to 2 phr (parts per hundreds of rubber). More importantly, there was a strong interfacial interaction between GO and IIR chains. When the GO content was 2 phr, the tear and tensile strengths of the GO/IIR composites were increased by 44% and 102%, respectively, compared with those of pure IIR. Additionally, it was found that the protective barrier properties against HD of GO/IIR composites increased with the increase in the GO content. When the GO content was 3 phr, a shielding filler network was formed by GO in the IIR matrix, and the diffusion coefficient of HD in IIR was decreased by 46%. The research results are of substantial importance for protection against HD and against more toxic gases or liquids.",

Results from FTIR studies indicate that the direct interaction of C-D...F between DMSO-d(6) and the anion [BF(4)(-)] plays a minor role in the blue-shift of nu(CD) in the mixtures of DMSO-d(6)/IL. They also show that the indirect influence of the hydrogen bond formed by the nearby functional group SO with C(2)-H of the cation significantly contributes to the blue-shift of nu(CD), as can be inferred from the significant differences of the blue-shift in [Bmim][BF(4)] and 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Bm(2)im][BF(4)]). In contrast, in the case of DMSO-d(6)/water mixtures, direct hydration of C-H...O between the methyl groups of DMSO-d(6) with the oxygen atom of water is mainly responsible for the blue shift of nu(CD). Furthermore, theoretical calculations revealed that charge migrations as well as rehybridization have a dominant effect on the blue-shift in both mixtures.",

The relationships between the microstructure of polynorbornenes and the transport of hydroxide ions were investigated by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The mobility of hydroxide ions was studied by the mean square displacement (MSD) curves. The results of the radial distribution functions (RDFs) of quaternary ammonium groups indicated that the functional groups were evenly distributed around the water channels. The RDFs of the hydroxide ions and the water molecules suggested that the hydroxide ions were surrounded by two layers of water shells. The migration of hydroxide ions occurred between two layers of water molecules, depending on the interactions of the hydrogen bonding. As the kinetic energy of a molecule increased with increasing the temperature, hydroxide ions moved faster at higher temperatures.",

In this work, we developed GTR/GBR membranes with localized drug delivery function to prevent infection by electrospinning of poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) and gelatin blended with metronidazole (MNA). Acetic acid (HAc) was introduced to improve the miscibility of PCL and gelatin to fabricate homogeneous hybrid nanofiber membranes. The effects of the addition of HAc and the MNA content (0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 wt.% of polymer) on the properties of the membranes were investigated. The membranes showed good mechanical properties, appropriate biodegradation rate and barrier function. The controlled and sustained release of MNA from the membranes significantly prevented the colonization of anaerobic bacteria. Cells could adhere to and proliferate on the membranes without cytotoxicity until the MNA content reached 30%. Subcutaneous implantation in rabbits for 8 months demonstrated that MNA-loaded membranes evoked a less severe inflammatory response depending on the dose of MNA than bare membranes. The biodegradation time of the membranes was appropriate for tissue regeneration. These results indicated the potential for using MNA-loaded PCL/gelatin electrospun membranes as anti-infective GTR/GBR membranes to optimize clinical application of GTR/GBR strategies.",

In this work, we developed GTR/GBR nanofiber membranes with localized drug delivery function to prevent infection. Metronidazole (MNA), an antibiotic, was successfully incorporated into electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibers at different concentrations (0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 wt% polymer). To obtain the optimum anti-infection membrane, we systematically investigated the physical-chemical and mechanical properties of the nanofiber membranes with different drug contents. The interaction between PCL and MNA was identified by molecular dynamics simulation. MNA released in a controlled, sustained manner over 2 weeks and the antibacterial activity of the released MNA remained. The incorporation of MNA improved the hydrophilicity and in vitro biodegradation rate of PCL nanofibers. The nanofiber membranes allowed cells to adhere to and proliferate on them and showed excellent barrier function. The membrane loaded with 30% MNA had the best comprehensive properties. Analysis of subcutaneous implants demonstrated that MNA-loaded nanofibers evoked a less severe inflammatory response than pure PCL nanofibers. These results demonstrate the potential of MNA-loaded nanofiber membranes as GTR/GBR membrane with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory function for extensive biomedical applications.",

Besides, the major reason for GTR membrane failure in clinical application is infection which can be prevented by loading anti-bacterial drug. To realize the consistency in membrane degradation rate and tissue regeneration rate of the anti-infective membrane, we developed metronidazole-loaded electrospun poly(\u025b-caprolactone)-gelatin nanofiber membranes with different poly(\u025b-caprolactone)/gelatin ratios (95:5, 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40, and 50:50). Homogeneous nanofibers were successfully fabricated. The mechanical strength of the membranes increased with the poly(\u025b-caprolactone) content, while the hydrophilicity decreased. The controlled and sustained release of metronidazole from all the membranes prevented the colonization of anaerobic bacteria. At all poly(\u025b-caprolactone)/gelatin ratios, all the membranes presented good biocompatibility while the increase of gelatin content resulted in enhanced cell adhesion and proliferation. Subcutaneous implantation in rabbits for 8 months demonstrated that all the membranes showed good biocompatibility without infection. Both in vitro and in vivo results showed that the biodegradation rate of the membranes was accelerated with the increase of gelatin content. The biodegradation rate and biocompatibility of the membranes can be adjusted by changing the PCL/gelatin ratio. The optimal membrane can be chosen based on the patient and tissue type to realize the synchronization of membrane degradation with tissue regeneration for the best treatment effect.",

In this work, we developed an electrospun PCL-gelatin hybrid membrane to be planted at decompressive craniectomy for preventing adhesion formation and facilitating subsequent cranioplasty. We prepared poly(\u03b5-caprolactone)-gelatin (PG) nanofiber membranes with different PCL-gelatin ratios. The architectural features, mechanical properties, cell barrier functions, in vivo degradability, biocompatibility and anti-adhesion function were investigated. All membranes were found to have high tensile strength, and the strength of the membranes improved with the PCL content increased. All the PG membranes presented good biocompatibility and cell isolation performances while an increase in the gelatin content resulted in an enhancement of cell adhesion and proliferation. Subcutaneous implantation in rabbits for 6 months demonstrated that all the membranes showed good biocompatibility and adjustable biodegradation behaviour. In rabbit cranial defects model, no adhesions were observed, either between the PG membranes and the dura, or between the membranes and the temporal muscle after 1 month implantation. PG membranes' anti-adhesive properties and biodegradable characteristics make it useful as a dural onlay for craniotomy in which a second surgery is planned.",

        "abstract": "Infection is the major reason for GTR/GBR membrane failure in clinical applications. In this work, we developed GTR/GBR membranes with localized drug delivery function to prevent infection. Hierarchical membranes containing micro- and nano-fibers were fabricated. The effects of the incorporation of gelatin and loading content of metronidazole (MNA) (0, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 wt% polymer) on the properties of the electrospun membranes were investigated. The interaction between PCL and MNA was identified by molecular dynamics simulation. MNA was released in a controlled manner, and the antibacterial activity of the released MNA remained. The incorporation of gelatin and MNA improved the hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, and in vitro biodegradation rate of PCL nanofibers. The electrospun membranes allowed cells to adhere to and proliferate on them and showed excellent barrier function. The membrane loaded with 30% MNA had the best comprehensive properties. Subcutaneous implantation results demonstrated that MNA-loaded membranes evoked a less severe inflammatory response than pure PCL nanofibers. These results demonstrated the potential of MNA-loaded membranes as GTR/GBR membranes with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory functions for biomedical applications.",

        "abstract": "Bacterial infection is a major problem world-wide, especially in wound treatment where it can severely prolong the healing process. In this study, a double drug co-delivery elastic antibacterial nanocomposite was developed by combining ciprofloxacin (CPX) and polymyxin B sulfate-loaded halloysite clay nanotubes (HNTs-B) into a gelatin elastomer. CPX nanoparticles which act against both gram positive and gram-negative bacterium were dispersed directly in the matrix, and polymyxin B sulfate was loaded in HNTs and then distributed into the matrix. The effect of CPX and HNTs-B content on the physical properties, cytotoxicity, fibroblast adhesion and proliferation, in vitro drug release behavior and anti-bacterial properties were systematically investigated. The ciprofloxacin crystals and HNT-B were distributed in the matrix uniformly. The HNTs in the drug loading system not only enhanced the matrix' tensile strength but also slowed down the release rate of the high dissoluble polymyxin B sulfate. When the amount of HNT in the matrix increased, the thermal stability and tensile strength also increased but the polymyxin B sulfate release rate decreased because the HNTs prevented the drug release inside. All the nanocomposites exhibited antimicrobial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria with the dual combination of drugs released from the nanocomposites. Furthermore, this kind of gelatin-based nanocomposites possesses higher water-absorbing quality, low cytotoxicity, adaptable biodegradability and good elasticity which can satisfy the requirements for an ideal biomaterial for use in wound healing applications.",

The physical interactions and chemical bonding between QAS/PCL and QAS/gelatin were demonstrated by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS. Measured water contact angle between the PCL-gelatin/QAS (PG-Q) nanofiber membranes suggested a hydrophobic surface, which has been shown to aid in removal of wound dressings. The mechanical strength of the membranes was sufficient to meet the clinical requirements. Furthermore, the 15% QAS (PG-Q15) and 20% QAS (PG-Q20) formulated nanofiber membranes showed a considerable increase in their bacteriostatic activity towards Staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (gram-negative) bacteria, suggesting a broad-spectrum bactericidal effect by the PG-Q membranes. The PG-Q membranes with various QAS formulations demonstrated little cytotoxicity. Therefore, the long-acting and broad-spectrum antimicrobial electrospun PG-Q micro/nanofibers membrane demonstrate potential efficacy asan antibacterial wound dressing.",

Herein, we describe our work aimed at fabricating an electrospun fibrous membrane as an artificial periosteum that exhibits flexibility, permeability and osteoinduction. This membrane was designed to cover the complex surface of bone grafts to facilitate and accelerate bone regeneration. The traditional Chinese medicine icariin (ICA) was subsequently introduced into poly (\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) /gelatin nanofibers to fabricate an artificial periosteum for the first time. The effects of ICA content on morphology, physical properties, drug release profile, in vitro degradability, biocompatibility and osteogenic differentiation properties were investigated. The ICA-loaded electrospun membranes showed significant improvement in hydrophilicity, high mechanical strength, appropriate degradation rates and excellent biocompatibility. Furthermore, clear enhancement in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, as well as an increase in osteocalcin (OCN) and type collagen I (COL I) expression in MC3T3-E1 cells were detected. Furthermore, we observed clear calcium deposition content in MC3T3-E1 cells cultured on ICA-loaded fibrous matrix. The membrane loaded with 0.05\u202fwt.% ICA displayed properties contributing to cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation. These results indicate the huge potential of this ICA-loaded PCL/gelatin electrospun membrane as a biomimetic artificial periosteum to accelerate bone regeneration.",

The conductive, healable, and self-adhesive hybrid network hydrogels are prepared from the delicate conformal coating of conductive functionalized single-wall carbon nanotube (FSWCNT) networks by dynamic supramolecular cross-linking among FSWCNT, biocompatible polyvinyl alcohol, and polydopamine. They exhibit fast self-healing ability (within 2 s), high self-healing efficiency (99%), and robust adhesiveness, and can be assembled as healable, adhesive, and soft human-motion sensors with tunable conducting channels of pores for ions and framework for electrons for real time and accurate detection of both large-scale and tiny human activities (including bending and relaxing of fingers, walking, chewing, and pulse). Furthermore, the soft human-motion sensors can be enabled to wirelessly monitor the human activities by coupling to a wireless transmitter. Additionally, the in vitro cytotoxicity results suggest that the hydrogels show no cytotoxicity and can facilitate cell attachment and proliferation. Thus, the healable, adhesive, wearable, and soft human-motion sensors have promising potential in various wearable, wireless, and soft electronics for human\u2013machine interfaces, human activity monitoring, personal healthcare diagnosis, and therapy.",

Use of 20 wt % nanotube content in fiber membranes allowed for 25 wt % metronidazole drug loading in the membrane. Nanotubes with a diameter of 50 nm and a length of 600 nm were aligned within the 400 nm diameter electrospun fibers, resulting in membranes with doubling of tensile strength along the collector rotating direction. The halloysite-doped membranes acted as barriers against cell ingrows and have good biocompatibility. The metronidazole-loaded halloysite nanotubes incorporated in the microfibers allowed for extended release of the drugs over 20 days, compared to 4 days when directly admixed into the microfibers. The sustained release of metronidazole from the membranes prevented the colonization of anaerobic Fusobacteria, while eukaryotic cells could still adhere to and proliferate on the drug-loaded composite membranes. This indicates the potential of halloysite clay nanotubes as drug containers that can be incorporated into electrospun membranes for clinical applications.",

        "abstract": "Partially biobased thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) with shape memory properties were prepared by in situ dynamic vulcanization of eucommia ulmoides gum (EUG) and polyolefin elastomer (POE). The cross-linked EUG phase dispersed in POE matrix acted as a framework structure throughout the POE phase, which limited irreversible deformation of POE and provided sufficient resilience force to drive the POE molecular chains to recover their initial shape. The shape memory results demonstrated that EUG/POE TPVs exhibited excellent shape memory properties with high shape fixity and shape recovery rate (all above 95%). The EUG with the dimensions of 0.4\u20131.6 \u03bcm dispersed in the POE matrix, and the more EUG phase resulted in large EUG aggregates. The cross-linked EUG phase considerably improved the permanent deformation of POE, and the tensile set linearly decreases from 134% to 4% with increasing EUG contents. The mechanical and shape memory properties of EUG/POE TPVs changed little after being reprocessed twice, ex...",

        "abstract": "Biodegradable polyester elastomers are widely reported to be applied in varied biomedical fields. In this paper, we attempt to investigate how both the thermal-curing time and molar ratio of the monomers affect the final compositions and properties of the novel poly(glycerol-sebacate-citrate) (PGSC) elastomers. First, PGSC elastomers are obtained after the thermal curing of the moldable mixtures consisting of citric acid and poly(glycerol-sebacate) (PGS) prepolymers synthesized in the lab. Then further studies show that, on the one hand, the control of longer thermal-curing time results in elastomers with less sol, lower swelling degree, slower degradation, greater mechanical strength and higher glass transition temperature and, on the other hand, the crosslink with more citric acid is advantageous to greatly improving their mechanical strength and glass transition temperatures, simultaneously decreasing their sol contents, swelling degrees and degradation rates. The PGSC elastomers show thermosetting properties, certain strength, mass losses lower than 20% after 4-week degradation and durative water absorption during degradation. Thus they might be potentially used as degradable bio-coatings, varied soft biomedical membranes and drug delivery matrices.",

Results showed that the chemical structures of PGSC elastomers were hardly influenced by the MWCNT loadings, and physical adsorption was thought as the main interaction between the MWCNTs and PGSC matrixes. When the MWCNT loading was 3\u00a0wt%, MWCNTs displayed a homogenous dispersion in the matrixes, and the composite's strength and modulus respectively reached 4.4\u00a0MPa and 9.2\u00a0MPa, increasing by 62.96% and 33.33% than that of pure PGSC matrixes. The degradation rates of the composites tended to decrease with the increase of MWCNT loadings in simulated body fluid (SBF) solution. The composites presented no cytotoxicity especially when the MWCNT loadings were above 1\u00a0wt%.

The surface composition and microstructure of the modified BT particles were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results show that PDA grafted with KH570 (denoted as PDA + KH570) was successfully coated on the BT particles. In addition, the PDA + KH570 layer containing double bonds not only improved the dispersion of the fillers in the polymer matrix but also helped in the formation of strong interfacial interactions between the BT particles and silicone elastomer matrix, which led to an improved dielectric constant and actuated strain. Finally, the tensile strength of all the silicone dielectric composites is larger than 5 MPa, which is much higher than commercial acrylic dielectric elastomers. This is a big advantage for the practical application of a dielectric elastomer.",

Subsequently, BT and the BT-KH570 particles were added into the BIIR matrix to form BT/BIIR and BT-KH570/BIIR dielectric composites. The BT-KH570/BIIR composite has a higher dielectric constant, better mechanical properties, and larger actuated strain compared with the BT/BIIR composite with the same filler content. The 10 phr BT-KH570/BIIR composite achieved the largest actuated strain. To further increase the actuated strain of the BT-KH570/BIIR composite, the polar plasticizer tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP) was added into the composite. Due to the polar groups of TBP, the dielectric constant of the TBP/BT-KH570/BIIR composite was improved and the elastic modulus decreased at the same time. As a result, we obtained a gain in actuated strain of 4.46% at an electric field of 22.5 kV mm\u22121, which corresponds to an increase of about 500% in comparison with that of pure BIIR. This represents a significant improvement in actuated strain performance.",

To decrease the enhanced elastic modulus of SR composites filled with high-dielectric-constant BaTiO 3  (BT) particles, silicone oil (SO) plasticizer was incorporated into the BT/SR composite to weaken the intermolecular interactions and break the structure of the filler network as result of swelling effect. The obviously decreased elastic modulus resulted in a high electromechanical sensitivity \u03b2 and a relatively large actuated strain of 10.6% for 20 phr BT/SR composite filled with 50 phr SO at a low electric field of 25\u202fkV/mm, approximately 380% increase compared to that of pure SR at the same electric field. The result indicates that tuning flexibility of composites is a good strategy to obtain high-performance dielectric elastomers.",

As strong adhesion of PDA to Al 2 O 3  nano-particles and hydrogen bonds formed by the catechol groups of PDA and the polar acrylonitrile groups of NBR, the dispersion of Al 2 O 3 -PDA/NBR composites was improved and the interfacial force between Al 2 O 3 -PDA and NBR matrix was enhanced. Thus, the Al 2 O 3 -PDA/NBR composites exhibited higher dielectric constant, better mechanical properties, and larger thermal conductivity comparing with Al 2 O 3 /NBR composites at the same filler content. The largest thermal conductivity of Al 2 O 3 -PDA/NBR composite filled with 30\u202fphr Al 2 O 3 -PDA was 0.21\u202fW/m\u202fK, which was 122% times of pure NBR.

The PDA coating on the Al2O3 nanoparticles improved its interfacial interaction between polymeric matrix and facilitated the uniform-dispersion of filler, leading to the 30 vol % Al2O3\u2013PDA/SR composite that exhibited a high thermal conductivity (0.585 W/((m\u00b7K))), which was almost 400% of pure silicone rubber (0.147 W/(m\u00b7K)).

Herein, the electric energy density and conversion efficiency of natural rubber (NR) composites have been enhanced by adding of barium titanate (BT) nanoparticles and dioctyl phthalate (DOP) plasticizer in NR matrix. Due to the synergistic effect of BT and DOP, a high dielectric constant and a low elastic modulus are exhibited by NR composites, which can be attributed to the adjusting of filler network and polymeric intermolecular attractions.

X-ray diffraction patterns and transmission electron microscope photographs of the nanocomposites showed that both fillers were dispersed randomly in the NR matrix at nano-scale and that the space between the clay layers was filled with carbon black particles. At the same total filler loadings, the mechanical properties of the naocomposites filled with both clay and carbon black, such as moduli at 100% and 300% elongation, tensile strength and tear strength, were greatly improved compared with those of either NR/clay nanocomposites or NR/carbon black nanocomposites. This indicates that the samples with both fillers possessed excellent mechanical properties. It was found that the NR/clay/carbon black nanocomposites retained advantages from both fillers, for example, the processability and dynamic properties were close to those of NR/carbon black nanocomposites, and the gas barrier properties were almost as good as those of NR/clay nanocomposites.",

        "abstract": "The study of preparing silica/rubber composites used in tires with low rolling resistance in an energy-saving method is fast-growing. In this study, a novel strategy is proposed, in which silica was modified by combing alcohol polyoxyethylene ether (AEO) and 3-mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane (K-MEPTS) for preparing silica/natural rubber (NR) master batches. A thermal gravimetric analyzer and Raman spectroscopy results indicated that both AEO and K-MEPTS could be grafted on to the silica surface, and AEO has a chance to shield the mercaptopropyl group on K-MEPTS. Silica modified by AEO and K-MEPTS together was completely co-coagulated with the rubber in preparing silica/NR composites using the latex compounding method with the help of the interaction between AEO and K-MEPTS. The performance of composites prepared by silica/NR master batches was investigated by a rubber process analyzer (RPA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and a tensile tester. These results demonstrate that AEO forms a physical interface between silica and rubber, resulting in good silica dispersion in the matrix. K-MEPTS forms a chemical interface between silica and rubber, enhancing the reinforcing effect of silica and reducing the mutual friction between silica particles. In summary, using a proper combination of AEO and K-MEPTS is a user-friendly approach for preparing silica/NR composites with excellent performance.",

The Si-747 that had a physical interaction with silica (Phy-747) and had a chemical interaction with silica (Che-747) could be separated by the extraction. The amount of Che-747 and Phy-747 were confirmed by thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA). The effect of Che-747 and Phy-747 on the hydrophilicity of silica were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR). The effect of water on the Phy-747 and the Che-747 were investigated by TGA, FT-IR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS); hydrogen bonds proved to be the main reason for the physical interaction between Si-747 and silica. Both Phy-747 and Che-747 were conducive to the co-coagulation in the preparation of silica/NR masterbatches. The effects of chemical and physical interaction between silica and rubber on different properties of silica/NR composites were also shown in this research.",

        "abstract": "The styrene butadiene rubber (SBR)-clay nano- compounds were prepared by the latex compounding method, and then hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (C16) and 3-aminopropyl triethoxy silane (KH550) were added into these nanocompounds on a two-roll mill to prepare nanocomposites with strong interfacial interaction. The structure and properties of SBR-clay nanocomposites were carefully studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies, trans- mission electron microscopy (TEM), Rubber Process Ana- lyzer (RPA), and mechanical testing. Compared with un- modified nanocomposites, the dispersion structure of modi- fied SBR-clay nanocomposites is better with part rubber- intercalated or part modifier-intercalated structure. The ten- sile strength and the modulus at 300% elongation of modi- fied SBR-clay nanocomposites are higher than three times of those of unmodified nanocomposites, respectively. 2006",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Despite that there have been many reports on the achievement of high-performance rubber/clay nanocomposites, the preparation strategies of these nanocomposites are still quite limited. In this study, a novel method named gel compounding method was utilized to prepare acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR)/clay nanocomposites via compounding solid rubber with clay gels. As illustrated by TEM and XRD, clay was uniformly dispersed in the NBR matrix as either exfoliated platelets or very thin layered silicate stacks, indicating the separated structure was formed in the NBR/clay nanocomposite prepared by this gel compounding method. Mechanical properties were significantly improved for the NBR/clay nanocomposites, which reached the tensile strength of 12.1\u202fMPa with 10 phr clay, more than 250% higher than that of pure NBR.",

During co-coagulation, VPR not only plays a key role in the prevention of aggregation of GO sheets but also acts as an interface-bridge between GO and SBR. The results demonstrated that the mechanical properties of the GO/SBR composite with 2.0 vol.% GO is comparable with those of the SBR composite reinforced with 13.1 vol.% of carbon black (CB), with a low mass density and a good gas barrier ability to boot. The present work also showed that GO-silica/SBR composite exhibited outstanding wear resistance and low-rolling resistance which make GO-silica/SBR very competitive for the green tire application, opening up enormous opportunities to prepare high performance rubber composites for future engineering applications.",

        "abstract": "Strong interfacial interaction and nanodispersion are necessary for polymer nanocomposites with expectations on mechanical performance. In this work, montmorillonite (MMT) was first structurally modified by acid treatment to produce more silanol groups on the layer surface. This was followed by chemical modification of \u03b3-methacryloxy propyl trimethoxysilane molecule (KH570) through covalent grafting with the silanol groups. (29)Si and (27)Al magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR results revealed the microstructural changes of MMT after acid treatment and confirmed the increase of silanol groups on acid-treated MMT surfaces. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated an increase in the grafted amount of organosilane on the MMT surface. X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that the functionalization process changed the highly ordered stacking structure of the MMT mineral into a highly disordered structure, indicating successful grafting of organosilane to the interlayer surface of the crystalline sheets. The styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR)/MMT nanocomposites were further prepared by co-coagulating with SBR latex and grafted-MMT aqueous suspension. During vulcanization, a covalent interface between modified MMT and rubber was established through peroxide-radical-initiated reactions, and layer aggregation was effectively prevented. The SBR/MMT nanocomposites had highly and uniformly dispersed MMT layers, and the covalent interfacial interaction was finally achieved and exhibited high performance.",

        "abstract": "Novel chiral N-propargylphosphonamidate monomers containing phenoxyl,imentholyl groups(1a) and propargyl esters having PEG side chain(1b~3b) with different lengths were synthesized by successive condensation.The single peak in the 31P-NMR spectrum indicated that pure diastereomer(1a) was obtained by using column chromatography on silica gel and then recrystallizing.The corresponding polymers with moderate molecular weights(Mn=1.8\u00d7104~2.5\u00d7104) in good yields(42.6%~80.3%) were synthesized by copolymerization of the diastereomer(1a) using(nbd)Rh+[\u03b76-C6H5B-(C6H5)3] as catalyst.The polarimetric,CD and UV-Vis spectroscopic data revealed that polymers existed in a helical form with one-handed screw sense predominantly in CHCl3 solvent.This study further shows that the helical structure was influenceed by internal and external factors.When the molecular weight of b block increases,the intensity of CD becomes higher.It was found that the secondary structure stability of the copolymer was better than homopolymer's in different mixed solvents.When the methanol quantity was up to 50%,the CD spectra changeed into positive and negative parts caused by the accumulation of the polymers.The assembly phenomenon of the Poly(1a-co-3b) was studied in different solvent systems(CHCl3/CH3OH,THF/H2O).It is clear from the SEM images of these systems,Poly(1a-co-3b) can be assembled into spherical shape and rodlike micellae in different solvents.",

The Gel-HHA-RGO nanosheets exhibited excellent colloidal dispersibility and stability in alkaline condition. The Gel-HHA-RGO filled natural rubber (NR) composites were prepared by water-based solution casting. Well-organized interconnected RGO networks were constructed throughout the NR matrix, which played an important role in determining the properties of composites. The tensile modulus and dynamic storage modulus were improved by several orders of magnitude with increasing RGO content. Meanwhile, a dramatic increase in electrical conductivity with a low percolation threshold of 0.21 vol % was perceived. Strain-sensing tests revealed that the RGO/NR composites exhibited outstanding strain sensitivity and repeatability, which could be used to detect the cyclic movements of human joints.

Antioxidants 2246, 6PPD, and MB, examples of amines, phenols, and heterocycles, respectively, were chosen to study these factors influencing the selection of antioxidants for the thermal-oxidative aging of butadiene rubber (BR).

In this study, to enhance the interface interaction between SiR and SSBR, trimethylolpropane tris(3-mercaptopropionate) (TMPMP) was carefully chosen to couple SiR and SSBR by in situ thiol-ene click reactions between mercapto groups of TMPMP and vinyl groups of SiR and SSBR. The reaction of TMPMP with SiR and SSBR was characterized via torque\u2013time curves, element analysis, and the dissolving\u2013swelling test. Accordingly, a two-step strategy was proposed to prepare SiR/SSBR composites. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that the two-step strategy reduced the phase domain size of the blend. The composite exhibited higher mechanical properties and lower hysteresis. The results would extend SiR applications.",

        "abstract": "A facile method for enhancing the interaction between pristine graphene and nonpolar rubber matrices was developed by preparing a new solution-polymerized styrene-butadiene-p-(2,2,2-triphenylethyl)styrene (TPES) rubber (SBTR). SBTR macroradicals were formed by the thermal decomposition of a 1,1,1,2-tetraphenylethane pendant. The macroradicals were successfully trapped by graphene through the formation of covalent bonds. This was confirmed by rotorless rheometer and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. The dispersion of graphene and interfacial interaction between graphene and the SBTR was significantly increased by increasing the TPES content in SBTR composites, as demonstrated by differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, rubber process analysis, and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis. The mechanical properties of the SBTR/GNS composites were significantly improved by the improved dispersion and the increased surface affinity of SBTR for graphene. The developed approach can be generally applied to the functionalization of other polymer matrices by copolymerizing TPES with other vinyl monomers for pristine graphene-based composite materials. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Isothermal crystallization, melting behavior, and nonisothermal crystallization of BDIS polyamides were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The Avrami equation was used to describe the isothermal crystallization of BDIS polyamides. The modified Avrami equation, the Ozawa equation, the modified Ozawa equation, and an equation combining the Avrami and Ozawa equations were used to describe the nonisothermal crystallization. The equilibrium melting point temperature of BDIS polyamide was determined to be 163.0\u00b0C. The Avrami exponent n was found to be in the range of 2.21\u20132.79 for isothermal crystallization and 4.10\u20135.52 for nonisothermal crystallization. POLYM. ENG.

Furthermore, the influence of ultrasonic irradiation time,TiO2 addition amount, solution acidity, ultrasound power, ionic kind and strength on the damage of DNA were also discussed. The results showed thst the catalytic perfor-mance of urtile TiO2 was evidently better than that of anatase TiO2 It was found that under a certain condition the damage degree of DNA molecule was aggravated with the increase of ultrasonic irradia-tion time,ultrasound power and TiO2addition amount,but weakened with the inerease of solution acid-ity. However,the influences of ionic kind and strength were different. The research results are of great significance for driving ultrasonic irradiation catalyzed by TiO2 to treat tumour in clinic application.",

However, this post-modern approach is achieved through reference and imitation. Therefore, it should not be considered as totally \u201cpost-modern\u201d narrative, but similar to it in nature. Such being the premise, the main purpose of this paper is to draw from the Advanced Novel the phases in the post-modern Chinese literature and their characteristics.",

        "abstract": "This research describes a new amplification signals system of the leaky surface acoustic wave (LSAW) bis-peptide nucleic acid (bis-PNA) biosensor for the simple, sensitive and rapid detection of the target double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The system consists of a RecA protein-coated complementary single-stranded DNA (cssDNA) probe complex that amplifies the biological signal to improve the sensitivity of the biosensor. The bis-PNA probe for detecting HPV was first immobilized on a gold surface membrane of the detection channel. After the probe was completely hybridized with the corresponding target DNA, different concentrations of the \"RecA protein-complementary single strand DNA probe\" were added to react with the bis-PNA/dsDNA complex. The phase shift of the LSAW biosensors, which was measured and found to be most significant when the RecA protein was 45 \u03bcg/mL and the ATP\u03b3S was 2.5 mmol/L. Compared with other concentrations (P<0.01) of RecA and ATP\u03b3S, the value of the phase shift was (11.74 \u00b1 1.03) degrees and the ratio of the phase shift and hybridization time clearly outperformed that of the other concentrations. Compared to the direct hybridization of the bis-PNA probe and the target DNA sequence, the sensitivity was effectively improved and the detection time was significantly shortened. PNA binding adjacent to the area of the target sequence homologous to the probe significantly increased the yield of the hybridization reaction between the PNA/dsDNA complex and the RecA protein-coated cssDNA probe. In this condition, the phase shift was significantly obvious and the detection time was significantly shortened. In conclusion, the combination of the RecA protein-coated cssDNA probe and the LSAW bis-PNA biosensor provides sensitivity and simple and rapid detection of clinical trace pathogenic microorganisms.",

However, the accuracy of HRMA in detection of BRAF mutations has not been systematically evaluated. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis involving 1324 samples from 14 separate studies. The overall sensitivity of HRMA was 0.99 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.75-0.82), and the overall specificity was very high at 0.99 (95% CI = 0.94-0.98). The values for the pooled positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio were 68.01 (95% CI = 25.33-182.64), 0.06 (95% CI = 0.03-0.11), and 1263.76 (95% CI = 393.91-4064.39), respectively. The summary receiver operating characteristic curve for the same data shows an area of 1.00 and a Q* value of 0.97. The high sensitivity and specificity, simplicity, low cost, less labor or time and rapid turnaround make HRMA a good alternative method for rapid detection of BRAF mutations in the clinical practice.",

We performed a meta-analysis to identify common clinical features in NSCLC patients carrying BRAF mutations.We identified clinical studies that examined the association between BRAF mutations and features of NSCLC within PubMed, Embase and ISI Science Citation Index database up to October 2013. The effect size of clinical features was estimated by odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for each study, using a fixed-effects or random-effects model.Ten studies with a total of 5599 NSCLC patients were included. There was a 3% (170/5599) BRAF mutation rate. BRAF mutations in NSCLC were significantly associated with adenocarcinomas (ADCs) (compared with non-ADCs, OR\u200a=\u200a4.96, 95%CI\u200a=\u200a2.29-10.75). There were no significant differences in gender, smoking and stage in patients with and without BRAF mutations. The BRAFV600E mutation was more frequent in women than non-BRAFV600E mutations (OR\u200a=\u200a0.27, 95%CI\u200a=\u200a0.12-0.59), and was closely related to never smokers (OR\u200a=\u200a0.14, 95%CI\u200a=\u200a0.05-0.42).These findings have important implications for the prediction of the NSCLC sub-types more accurately combined with other genetic changes.",

        "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease with multiple underlying causative genetic mutations. The B-type Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) plays an important role in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade during CRC. The presence of BRAFV600E mutation can determine the response of a tumor to chemotherapy. However, the association between the BRAFV600E mutation and the clinicopathological features of CRC remains controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the effect of BRAFV600E mutation on the clinicopathological characteristics of CRC.We identified studies that examined the effect of BRAFV600E mutation on CRC within the PubMed, ISI Science Citation Index, and Embase databases. The effect of BRAFV600E on outcome parameters was estimated by odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each study using a fixed effects or random effects model.25 studies with a total of 11,955 CRC patients met inclusion criteria. The rate of BRAFV600 was 10.8% (1288/11955). The BRAFV600E mutation in CRC was associated with advanced TNM stage, poor differentiation, mucinous histology, microsatellite instability (MSI), CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). This mutation was also associated with female gender, older age, proximal colon, and mutL homolog 1 (MLH1) methylation.This meta-analysis demonstrated that BRAFV600E mutation was significantly correlated with adverse pathological features of CRC and distinct clinical characteristics. These data suggest that BRAFV600E mutation could be used to supplement standard clinical and pathological staging for the better management of individual CRC patients, and could be considered as a poor prognostic marker for CRC.",

The room temperature photoluminescence intensity of the fast-grown sample is much stronger than that of the slow-grown one. In addition, the fast-grown sample has two luminescence peaks at low temperatures, and the height of main peak anomalously increases with increasing temperature below 100 K. Such improved emission efficiency and the untypical temperature-induced increase of peak height can be attributed to the carrier's transferring between two kinds of localized traps with different potential depth in the fast-grown sample, where the distribution of indium is seriously inhomogeneous. The enhanced fluctuation of indium is caused by the reduced migration time of adsorbed atoms due to the increased growth rate during the epitaxial growth of MQW region.",

        "abstract": "Twelve InGaN MQW LED samples with varying well thickness grown via metal-organic chemical vaper deposition (MOCVD) are investigated. It is observed from electroluminescence (EL) measurement that at low current densities, the peak energy shifts to blue with increasing current, and when the current change by fixed increment, the peak energy shifts to blue end to different extent among samples. This blue shift was expected to be stronger when the well thickness increases, however, for well widths above 5 nm we observe a decrease in emission energy. Since no relaxation was detected from reciprocal space mapping (RSM), the deteriorated homogeneity is found to be responsible for this phenomenon. Temperature dependent photoluminescence (TDPL) results analyzed by band-tail model fitting show that the localization effect gets more prominent with increasing well thickness. It is found that elevating the growth temperature of active region from 710\u00b0C to 750\u00b0C significantly improves the homogeneity of InGaN layer.",

In this study, ten u-GaN samples grown via metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) are investigated. It is observed from the room temperature (RT) photoluminescence (PL) measurements that the YL band is enhanced in the PL spectra of those samples if their MOCVD growth is carried out with a decrease of pressure, temperature, or flow rate of NH\u2083. Furthermore, a strong dependence of YL band intensity on the carbon concentration is found by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) measurements, demonstrating that the increased carbon-related defects in these samples are responsible for the enhancement of the YL band.",

The higher-In-content sample exhibits a lower efficiency, followed by a more significant droop as current increases in comparison with the lower-In-content diode. However, it is found that for both samples their efficiency reduction trend with increasing carrier density is nearly the same. Combining with the recombination rate equations, an analysis reveals that at the same injection current level, the carrier density in the higher-In-content quantum wells which have stronger polarization effect is larger due to the smaller bimolecular recombination coefficient, resulting in a more significant droop with current. Therefore, a study on the dependence of efficiency on carrier density can provide a clear elucidation to the physical mechanism of the efficiency droop behavior.",

It is found that the dependence of the differential resistance upon the injection current differs in the GaAs- and GaN-based LDs mainly in two aspects. The first is the kink polarity of the differential resistance in the vicinity of the threshold current, and the second is the behavior of the differential resistance curve beyond the threshold current. Self-consistent calculation results suggest that the LD kink and its polarity are determined by the superposition effects of the n-side, active and p-side regions of LDs. It is found that this kink mainly differs in the differential resistance curves of the active region, while the difference in the behavior of the differential resistance curve after the lasing threshold is ascribed to a resistance change in the p-side region caused by a reduced ideality factor.",

The thin heavily Mg-doped GaN (p(++)-GaN) contact layer with DLD band can effectively improve the performance of Ni/Au ohmic contact to p-GaN. The temperature-dependent I-V measurement shows that the variable-range hopping (VRH) transportation through the DLD band plays a dominant role in the ohmic contact. The thickness and Mg/Ga flow ratio of p(++)-GaN contact layer have a significant effect on ohmic contact by controlling the Mg impurity doping and the formation of a proper DLD band. When the thickness of the p(++)-GaN contact layer is 25 nm thick and the Mg/Ga flow rate ratio is 10.29%, an ohmic contact with low specific contact resistivity of 6.97 x 10(-4) Omega.cm(2) is achieved.",

And the different variation behaviors of resistivity with growth condition for high- temperature(HT)-grown and low-temperature(LT)-grown p-GaN films are investigated. It is found that the resistivity of HT-grown p-GaN film is nearly unchanged when the NH3 flow rate or reactor pressure increases. However, it decreases largely for LT-grown p-GaN film. These different variations may be attributed to the fact that carbon impurities are easy to incorporate into p-GaN film when the growth temperature is low. It results in a relatively high carbon concentration in LT-grown p-GaN film compared with HT-grown one. Therefore, carbon concentration is more sensitive to the growth condition in these samples, ultimately, leading to the different variation behaviors of resistivity for HT- and LT-grown ones.",

The optical and electrical characteristics of LDs are calculated by the economic software LASTIP, and it is found that the leakage of optical field is suppressed significantly and the threshold current is also reduced. Further theoretical analysis shows that n-In 0.08 Ga 0.92 N LWG and u-In 0.02 Ga 0.98 N QB is effective to concentrate the optical field and to enhance optical confinement for our green LDs, leading to an improvement of optical and electrical performance of green LDs.",

Specific contact resistance (\u03c1 c ) with various residual carbon concentrations has been investigated through the circular transmission line model (CTLM) method and secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) analysis. A correlation between residual carbon and \u03c1 c  indicates that incorporation of proper carbon impurity can be an advantage for Ohmic contact, although carbon can also act as a compensating donor to worsen the Ohmic contact at a very high concentration. Finally, \u03c1 c  is improved to 6.80\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22125 \u00a0\u03a9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0cm 2  with a carbon concentration of 8.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 17 \u00a0cm \u22123  in p ++ -GaN layer, when the growth temperature, pressure and flow rate of CP 2 Mg and TMGa are 940\u00a0\u00b0C, 100\u00a0Torr, 3\u00a0\u03bcmol/min and 28\u00a0\u03bcmol/min, respectively.",

It is found that when an SQW interlayer is inserted below InGaN/GaN green multiquantum wells (GMQWs), the emission intensity of the GMQW active region increases. This is attributed to the reduction of quantum confined stark effect and the V-pit density due to the decreased strain in GMQWs. In addition, we also find that inserting an SQW interlayer theoretically results in a weak leakage of the optical mode for green LDs. Therefore, their performance will be improved.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The investigation on the photovoltaic characteristics of two InGaN/GaN multiple-quantum-well (MQW) solar cells with different QW parameters, but having nearly the same spectral response range, is assisted by the capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements. Based on the laser-assisted C-V technique as well as the X-ray reciprocal space mapping measurements, it is found the enhanced external quantum efficiency of solar cell consisting of the InGaN QWs having thicker well layer and lower In content can be ascribed to the lower effective potential barrier height, the larger active volume and the better material quality. In addition, it suggests that for InGaN MQW solar cells, a proper increase of the InGaN well layer thickness may be a good choice to extend the spectral response into longer wavelength region.",

        "abstract": "Compared with GaN-based visible GaN/InGaN multiple-quantum-well laser diodes (LDs), near-ultraviolet LDs may suffer from a sever hole leakage due to the shallower quantum wells (QWs). Here, a 10\u2009nm n-type AlGaN hole blocking layer (HBL) is proposed to put before the first quantum barrier layer and form a barrier on the valence band to prevent injected holes from leaking into the n-type region. Furthermore, the effect of Al composition of AlxGa1\u2212xN HBL on LD performance is studied. Theoretical analysis is performed by using advanced device simulation. The simulation results show that lower threshold current and higher output power of LD can be obtained when Al composition of AlxGa1\u2212xN HBL is 0.23. This result can be attributed to a dramatically reduced electron and hole leakage, and more stimulated recombination in QWs.",

It is found that a decrease slope efficiency is resulted when the indium content of In x Ga 1-x N quantum barrier (QB) layers is higher than about 1%, which is caused by the significantly increase of electron leakage current due to the piezoelectric polarization effect in high indium content In x Ga 1-x N last QB (LQB) layer. Therefore, an asymmetric MQW with a thin thickness of LQB is designed to lower the piezoelectric polarization effect and to reduce the electron leakage current. Meanwhile, a new LD structure with high In x Ga 1-x N LWG is also proposed to further reduce the optical loss. The two ways are useful to improve the slope efficiency.",

        "abstract": "The upper waveguide (UWG) has direct influences on the optical and electrical characteristics of the violet laser diode (LD) by changing the optical field distribution or barrier of the electron blocking layer (EBL). In this study, a series of InGaN-based violet LDs with different UWGs are investigated systematically with LASTIP software. It is found that the output light power (OLP) under an injecting current of 120 mA or the threshold current (I th) is deteriorated when the UWG is u-In0.02Ga0.98N/GaN or u-In0.02Ga0.98N/Al x Ga1\u2212x N (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.1), which should be attributed to small optical confinement factor (OCF) or severe electron leakage. Therefore, a new violet LD structure with u-In0.02Ga0.98N/GaN/Al0.05Ga0.95N multiple layer UWG is proposed to reduce the optical loss and increase the barrier of EBL. Finally, the output light power under an injecting current of 120 mA is improved to 176.4 mW.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In InGaN/GaN multi-quantum wells (MQWs), a low temperature cap (LT-cap) layer is grown between the InGaN well layer and low temperature GaN barrier layer. During the growth, a temperature ramp-up and ramp-down process is added between LT-cap and barrier layer growth. The effect of temperature ramp-up time duration on structural and optical properties of quantum wells is studied. It is found that as the ramp-up time increases, the Indium floating layer on the top of the well layer can be diminished effectively, leading to a better interface quality between well and barrier layers, and the carrier localization effect is enhanced, thereby the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of QWs increases surprisingly. However, if the ramp-up time is too long, the carrier localization effect is weaker, which may increase the probabilities of carriers to meet with nonradiative recombination centers. Meanwhile, more nonradiative recombination centers will be introduced into well layers due to the indium evaporation. Both of them will lead to a reduction of internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of MQWs.",

        "abstract": "The InGaN/GaN multi-quantum wells (MQWs) are prepared at the same condition by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) except the thickness of cap layers additionally grown on each InGaN well layer. The photoluminescence (PL) intensity of the thin cap layer sample is much stronger than that of thicker cap layer sample. Interestingly, the thick cap layer sample has two photoluminescence peaks under high excitation power, and the PL peak energy-temperature curves show an anomalous transition from reversed V-shaped to regular S-shaped with increasing excitation power. Meanwhile, it exhibits a poorer thermal stability of thick cap layer sample under higher excitation power than that under lower excitation power. Such an untypical phenomenon is attributed to carrier redistribution between the two kinds of localized states which is induced by the inhomogeneous distribution of indium composition in thick cap layer sample. Furthermore, the luminescence of deep localized states has a better thermal stability, and the luminescence of shallow localized states has a poor thermal stability. In fact, such a severer inhomogeneous indium distribution may be caused by the degradation of subsequent epitaxial growth of InGaN/GaN MQWs region due to longer low-temperature GaN cap layer growth time.",

        "abstract": "The influence of Shockley\u2013Read\u2013Hall (SRH) non-radiative recombination on efficiency droop is investigated for two similar InGaN/GaN multiple-quantum-well green light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with quite different luminescence efficiency. The high-efficiency diode exhibits a pronounced efficiency peak followed by a significant droop as injection current increases, while the low-efficiency sample shows a relatively small droop. Combining with the recombination rate equations, our analysis reveals that, in comparison with the high-efficiency sample, in the low-efficiency diode the injected carrier density in InGaN well layers is decreased at high currents due to the strong SRH process, leading to an apparently reduced droop. This may be a possible physical mechanism responsible for the linkage between the low efficiency and the small efficiency droop.",

In this study, growth temperature of the p-Al x Ga 1-x N (0.08\u00a0\u2264\u00a0x\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.104) layers are controlled to be relatively low, and the influence of hydrogen impurity on the resistivity is investigated in detail. According to the dependence of hole concentration and resistivity on hydrogen impurity concentration, it is found that when Mg doping concentration is unchanged, reducing hydrogen impurity concentration in p-Al x Ga 1-x N (0.08\u00a0\u2264\u00a0x\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.104) layers could reduce the resistivity effectively, which is attributed to weaken the compensation or passivation effect of hydrogen impurities on Mg acceptors. A p-Al 0.09 Ga 0.91 N layer with a low resistivity of 4.6\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0cm\u00a0has been achieved.",

It is experimentally observed that, during the TDPL measurements at some fixed temperatures, the PL spectra of bare InGaN film show anomalous attenuation and redshift with time passing. This may be attributable to the enhancement of quantum-confined Stark effect in InGaN layer due to the desorption of the negatively charged particles on the surface of bare InGaN film, because the adsorbed negative charges on InGaN surface partially counteract the piezoelectric field in the ultra-thin InGaN film. However, for the GaN-capped InGaN ultra-thin film, those anomalous spectral variations with time vanish, as the adsorption and desorption process on the InGaN surface are screened by the GaN cap layer.",

The electrical and optical characteristics of a blue-violet LD are investigated under direct-current injection at room temperature (25 \u00b0C). The stimulated emission wavelength and peak optical power of the LD are around 413 nm and over 600 mW, respectively. In addition, the threshold current density and voltage are as small as 1.46 kA/cm 2  and 4.1 V, respectively. Moreover, the lifetime is longer than 1000 hours under room-temperature continuous-wave operation.",

It is found that the annealing has a positive effect on reducing the effect of the In rich layer on the subsequent growth of quantum barrier. At the same time, it is found that annealing can release stress and make the LLCs of QW more uniform, annealing will improve the interface between the quantum well and quantum barrier and reduce the influence of dislocation on the luminescence of MQW. However, a nonradiative recombination center with an activation energy around 110\u202fmeV was found to increase with annealing time.",

Meanwhile, we also propose the approach and suggest the mechanism to remove them for green InGaN/GaN QW grown on both GaN templates and free-standing GaN substrates. By engineering the interface of green InGaN/GaN QWs, we have achieved green laser diode (LD) structure with low threshold current density of 1.85 kA cm<sup>-2</sup>.

Microdisk laser featured with low-loss whispering gallery modes can emit directional lasing beam through a closely coupled on-chip waveguide efficiently, and hence is particularly suitable for photonics integration. The realization of electrically pumped III-nitride microdisk laser grown on Si has been impeded by the conventional undercut structure, poor material quality, and a limited quality of GaN microdisk formed by dry etching. Here we report a successful fabrication of room-temperature electrically pumped InGaN-based microdisk lasers grown on Si. A dramatic narrowing of the electroluminescence spectral line-width and a clear discontinuity in the slope of light output power plotted as a function of the injection current provide an unambiguous evidence of lasing. This is the first observation of electrically pumped lasing in InGaN-based microdisk lasers grown on Si at room temperature.",

Energetic ion sputter, as an effective interface probe, is widely used to profile the metal/GaN contacts for interfacial analysis and process optimization. However, the details of ion-induced interfacial reaction, as well as the formation of sputter by-products at the interfaces are still unclear. Here by combining state-of-the-art Ar ion sputter with in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ex-situ high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), we have observed clearly not only the ion-induced chemical state changes at interface, but also the by-products at the prototypical Ti/GaN system. For the first time, we identified the formation of a metallic Ga layer at the GaO/GaN interface. At the Ti/GaO interface, TiC components were also detected due to the reaction between metal Ti and surface-adsorbed C species. Our study reveals that the corresponding core level binding energy and peak intensity obtained from ion sputter depth profile should be treated with much caution, since they will be changed due to ion-induced interface reactions and formation of by-products during ion bombardment.",

Gradual degradation of the LD is presented with the threshold current increase and the slope efficiency decrease. The cathodoluminescence and photoluminescence characterizations of the LD show a dislocation independent degradation of the active region under the ridge. Detailed studies on the temperature-dependent micro-photoluminescence and the electroluminescence indicate that the degradation of the LD is attributed to the generation of non-radiative recombination centers in the local multiple quantum well regions with lower indium content. The activation energy of the non-radiative recombination centers is about 10.2\u2009meV.",

Local damage on the aged LD is identified with the reduction of the electron beam induced current intensity. A pipe-shaped defect is observed in the particular damaged region by using the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning TEM technique. Diffusion of the contact metal along the defect is enhanced by the local electric field and high temperature. Catastrophic degradation of the LD occurs due to burning of the local region.",

It is found that a potential barrier located at the interface between GaN last barrier and InGaN upper waveguide layer causes strong recombination in InGaN upper waveguide layer and lowers the carrier injection efficiency of InGaN-based green LDs when In content is higher than 4%. A suitable reduction of indium content in InGaN upper waveguide layer can effectively suppress recombination in waveguide and thus reduce the threshold current of green LDs.",

        "abstract": "Research on GaN-based blue and green laser diodes (LDs) has attracted great attention in the past years to meet the demand for laser display application. In this letter, we improve luminescence homogeneity and reduce internal loss of GaN-based blue LD structures grown on    $c$   -plane free-standing GaN substrates. The morphologies of homoepitaxial GaN layers are greatly affected by offcut orientation and an angle of GaN substrates. Perfect morphology with straight atomic steps and regular terrace width can be obtained for GaN layers grown on GaN substrates with an offcut angle of 0.42\u00b0 toward    $m$   -plane. On GaN substrates with an offcut angle of 0.4\u00b0 toward    $m$   -plane, homoepitaxial LD structures grown utilizing the same growth temperature for InGaN quantum wells and GaN quantum barriers have narrowest emission linewidth and very homogeneous luminescence. The internal loss is greatly reduced by optimizing Mg doping profile. As a result, we have achieved GaN-based blue laser diodes with 2.2 W of light output power under continuous-wave operation at room temperature.",

Emissions from the two quantum wells can be distinguished at low temperature at low excitation power density due to the different built-in electric field in the two quantum wells. This finding is utilized to study the degradation of InGaN/GaN blue laser diodes. Two peaks are observed for the non-aged laser diode (LD), while one peak for the aged LD which performed 3200\u2009h until no laser output is detected. The disappearance of the high energy peak in the photoluminescence spectra indicates a heavier degradation of the quantum well on the p-side, which agrees with our previous observation that both the linewidth and the potential fluctuation of InGaN quantum wells (QWs) reduced for the aged LDs.",

An Al-composition step down-graded AlN/AlGaN multilayer buffer was carefully engineered to not only tackle the huge difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion between AlGaN template and Si substrate, but also reduce the threading dislocation density caused by the large lattice mismatch. On top of the crack-free n-AlGaN template, high quality InGaN/AlGaN quantum wells were grown, sandwiched by waveguide and optical cladding layers, for the fabrication of edge-emitting laser diode. A dramatic narrowing of the electroluminescence spectral line-width, an elongated far-field pattern, and a clear discontinuity in the slope of light output power plotted as a function of the injection current provide an unambiguous evidence of lasing.",

Upward surface band bending of varying degree was observed distinctly upon to the treatment methods. Besides the nitrogen vacancies, we found that surface states of oxygen-containing absorbates (O-H component) also contribute to the surface band bending, which lead the Fermi level pined at a level further closer to the conduction band edge on  n -GaN surface. The  n -GaN surface with lower surface band bending exhibits better linear electrical properties for Ti/GaN Ohmic contacts. Moreover, the density of positively charged surface states could be derived from the values of surface band bending.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The accuracy and error propagation for determining the low specific contact resistance of Ohmic contacts on III-V wide band-gap semiconductors based on the circular transmission line model have been analyzed and the validity of this method is discussed in detail. The accuracy is more susceptible to the factors including data fitting method, electrical measurement technique and contact area correction. By using the equations of the original circular transmission line model to extract the fitting parameters, the calculation accuracy is much improved and the inapplicability of the linear least-square fitting is prevented. To further improve the accuracy, a four-probe current-voltage measurement technique was adopted to reduce the parasitic series resistances and the uncertainty bound, especially for the Ohmic contact with low sheet resistance of the semiconductor. Moreover, we have studied the size effect of contact pads of patterns and demonstrated that contact area correction is necessary for the semiconductor with high sheet resistance. A comprehensive error analysis is also performed to fully understand all the impact factors on this advanced method of specific contact resistance measurement, which is benefit for device performance evaluation and failure analysis.",

Utilizing less expensive and large-diameter Si substrates for hetero-epitaxial growth of indium gallium nitride/gallium nitride (InGaN/GaN) multiple quantum well (MQW) structure can substantially reduce the cost of blue LDs and boost their applications. To obtain a high crystalline quality crack-free GaN thin film on Si for the subsequent growth of a blue laser structure, a hand-shaking structure was formed by inserting Al-composition step down-graded AlN/AlGaN buffer layers between GaN and Si substrate. Thermal degradation in InGaN/GaN blue MQWs was successfully suppressed with indium-rich clusters eliminated by introducing hydrogen during the growth of GaN quantum barriers (QBs) and lowering the growth temperature for the p-type AlGaN/GaN superlattice optical cladding layer. A continuous-wave (CW) electrically pumped InGaN/GaN quantum well (QW) blue (450\u2009nm) LD grown on Si was successfully demonstrated at room temperature (RT) with a threshold current density of 7.8\u2009kA/cm.",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) island morphologies have been widely reported for green light-emitting InGaN quantum well (QW) layers, but the step-flow morphology has not been obtained for a green InGaN QW layer to date. In this Letter, we first investigate the cause of the 2D island morphology of green InGaN QWs via a comparison study with blue InGaN QWs. The short diffusion lengths of adatoms at low growth temperatures were found to be the cause of the 2D island morphology for the green InGaN QW. Step-flow growth of green InGaN QWs was obtained by increasing the miscut angle of the c-plane GaN substrates from 0.20\u00b0 to 0.48\u00b0, which reduces the atomic terrace width. Green InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQWs) with step-flow morphologies were found to have sharper well/barrier interfaces than MQWs with 2D island morphologies. The internal quantum efficiency of the green InGaN/GaN MQWs with the step-flow morphology is double that of the corresponding MQWs with the 2D island morphology at an excitation power density...",

        "abstract": "A method of identifying laser degradation mechanism is established based on thermal characteristic analysis of InGaN/GaN laser diodes (LDs). Both steady and transient thermal characteristics of LDs are calculated by the finite-element analysis method, the results show that thermal resistance and thermal time constant of each layer are determined by the corresponding structure and material. Experiments on thermal characteristics of LDs are carried out, degradation induced heat transport irregularities are localized by comparing the transient cooling curves of the virgin, and degraded LDs and further analyses give more information on degradation mechanisms of the LDs. The results confirm that this identification method is an effective method, which gives specific guidance for the analysis of the laser degradation mechanisms.",

By reducing carbon impurity concentration from 2\u00d71018 cm-3 to 5\u00d71016 cm-3, the resistivity of p-Al0.07Ga0.93N decreases from 7.4 \u03a9\u00b7cm to 2.2 \u03a9\u00b7cm. By applying the growth conditions of low-temperature AlGaN: Mg with low carbon incorporation to cladding layer of green LD structure, we have obtained green LDs with series resistance as low as 2.4 \u03a9 and operation voltage of 4.9 V at 4 kA/cm2. The green LDs lased at 508 nm with a threshold current density of 8.5 kA/cm2and a slope efficiency of 0.22 W/A. (\u00a9 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH u0026 Co. KGaA, Weinheim)",

It has 3 pairs of intramolecular disulfide bonds which can break to form the linear analog of hBD-3 under reducing conditions. hBD-3 can disrupt both gram-positive and gram-negative cell membranes, and even mammalian cell membrane at high concentrations. However, the structural basis for the membrane-disrupting function of hBD-3 is still unknown. In order to understand the interaction mechanism of hBD-3 with a neutrally-charged lipid membrane, explicit solvent and lipid umbrella-sampling simulations were performed using NAMD program on the hBD-3 wild-type and the linear analog, in both the monomer and dimer forms. During the insertion and translocation process, most of the protein structure changes take place near the membrane-solvent interface, while the membrane interior appears to stabilize and rigidify the native-like hBD-3 structure. An energy barrier of 20 kcal/mol(domain unit) should be overcome by hBD-3 dimer in wild-type to cross the POPC bilayer but only 13 kcal/mol(domain unit) to insert into the bilayer center, and 20 kcal/mol for hBD-3 monomers to insert into the membrane center. Significant reorientation of lipids around hBD-3 inside the membranes was observed, which suggests a toroidal model for the membrane disruption process.",

        "title": "Investigation on Plexin Rho GTPase Binding Domain (RBD) Binding with Small Rho GTPases Using Molecular Dynamics Simulations",
        "abstract": "Plexins are a family of single pass transmembrane receptors with 9 family members: plexin-A1-4, B1-3, C1 and D1. Plexins receive the guidance cues of semaphoring ligands on the outside of the cell and transmit their signal through the lipid membrane. Because of their function, plexins can regulate cell migration and targeting processes, for example by controlling axon and blood vessel guidance. Misfunction of plexin enables serious diseases, including cancer metastasis.Up to now, it is believed that the binding of small Rho GTPases with the Rho GTPase Binding Domain (RBD) of plexin is necessary to the function of plexin. At the meanwhile, the same RBD can bind with different small Rho GTPases, such as Rac1 and Rnd1 GTPase, and different RBDs such plexin-A1-RBD, plexin-A2-RBD, plexin-B1-RBD, can bind with the same GTPase. Thus understanding the structure and dynamics of the free and bound forms of RBD and GTPases can help to understand the signal transduction processes of plexin.In this project, the complexes of RBDs bound with Rac1/Rnd1 GTPases, and the free form of RBDs and GTPases were investigated using miscrosecond length all atom molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that RBDs experience more structural changes than Rho-GTPases during the binding process. Different RBDs showed different structure fluctuation dependences on regions when binding with small Rho GTPases. Calculating the backbone dihedral angle covariance matrix, all the RBDs in the free states have similar correlations to their bound states, but the Rac1 GTPase in the free states has less correlations than their bound states. Mapping the highly correlated residues to the structure, it was expected that plexin-A1-RBD, plexin-B1-RBD, and plexin-A2-RBD all having similar signal pathways, but different key residues taking the role in the process.",

        "abstract": "Heterodimerization of transmembrane helices of cell surface receptors is emerging as an important theme in cellular signaling. The most common motif for dimerization of alpha-helical transmembrane proteins is the GXXG motif. Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) and Plexin D1 (Pld1) are both single-pass transmembrane receptors expressed in all vertebrate systems. The ligands for Nrp1 and Pld1 are a class of guidance molecules called Semaphorin 3 (Sema3). Signaling by all Sema3 ligands (except Sema3E) through Pld1 requires Nrp1. The Sema3/Nrp1/Pld1 signaling axis plays a role in angiogenesis, immune responses, cancer metastasis as well as invasiveness. Despite the established roles in normal physiology and pathology, the molecular details of signaling pathways involved are not well documented. There are no structural/mechanistic level details; it is still unknown which domain/domains of Nrp1 and Pld1 interact. Here we report heterodimerization of the transmembrane (TM) helices of Nrp1 and Pld1. Nrp1 has two GXXG motifs and it is established that the dimerization of the Nrp1 TM helices is important for signaling. Using NMR and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations we show that Nrp1 and Pld1 forms a parallel transmembrane helix dimer. Further, we compare this heterodimer with Nrp1 homodimer and show that the homodimer utilizes the C-terminal GXXG motif of Nrp1 for dimerization. Whereas, the Nrp1/Pld1 heterodimer uses the N-terminal GXXG motif. The ability to use alternative surfaces for dimerization likely has implications for the higher-order assembly of Nrp1/Pld1 in the membrane. Further, using functional assays we show that the heterodimerization of Nrp1 TM helices is essential for Sema3/Nrp1/Pld1 signaling. This to our knowledge is the first report of a functional role for transmembrane helix dimerization in Plexin signaling.",

        "abstract": "Abstract  The process of protein complex dissociation remains to be understood at the atomic level of detail. Computers now allow microsecond timescale molecular-dynamics simulations, which make the visualization of such processes possible. Here, we investigated the dissociation process of the EphA2-SHIP2 SAM-SAM domain heterodimer complex using unrestrained all-atom molecular-dynamics simulations. Previous studies on this system have shown that alternate configurations are sampled, that their interconversion can be fast, and that the complex is dynamic by nature. Starting from different NMR-derived structures, mutants were designed to stabilize a subset of configurations by swapping ion pairs across the protein-protein interface. We focused on two mutants, K956D/D1235K and R957D/D1223R, with attenuated binding affinity compared with the wild-type proteins. In contrast to calculations on the wild-type complexes, the majority of simulations of these mutants showed protein dissociation within 2.4  \u03bc s. During the separation process, we observed domain rotation and pivoting as well as a translation and simultaneous rolling, typically to alternate and weaker binding interfaces. Several unsuccessful recapturing attempts occurred once the domains were moderately separated. An analysis of protein solvation suggests that the dissociation process correlates with a progressive loss of protein-protein contacts. Furthermore, an evaluation of internal protein dynamics using quasi-harmonic and order parameter analyses indicates that changes in protein internal motions are expected to contribute significantly to the thermodynamics of protein dissociation. Considering protein association as the reverse of the separation process, the initial role of charged/polar interactions is emphasized, followed by changes in protein and solvent dynamics. The trajectories show that protein separation does not follow a single distinct pathway, but suggest that the mechanism of dissociation is common in that it initially involves transitions to surfaces with fewer, less favorable contacts compared with those seen in the fully formed complex.",

        "abstract": "The Plexin family of transmembrane receptors are unique in that their intracellular region interacts directly with small GTPases of the Rho family. The Rho GTPase binding domain of plexin (RBD)\u2014which is responsible for these interactions\u2014can bind with Rac1 as well as Rnd1 GTPases. GTPase complexes have been crystallized with the RBDs of plexinA1, -A2, and -B1. The protein association is thought to elicit different functional responses in a GTPase and plexin isoform specific manner, but the origin of this is unknown. In this project, we investigated complexes between several RBD and Rac1/Rnd1 GTPases using multimicrosecond length all atom molecular dynamics simulations, also with reference to the free forms of the RBDs and GTPases. In accord with the crystallographic data, the RBDs experience more structural changes than Rho-GTPases upon complex formation. Changes in protein dynamics and networks of correlated motions are revealed by analyzing dihedral angle fluctuations in the proteins. The extent of thes...",

However, strange filter naming mechanisms bring users a bad experience and make them confused. How to establish a new filter naming mechanism that can improve the cognitive efficiency of users and verify it by experiments are the focus of this paper. Firstly, research the motivations of using filters, then extract and sort out the existing main filter naming mechanisms. Then use the analysis of text or questionnaire to extract the emotional expression of imagery words of using filters, sort out the words by cluster analysis. Through a research of correlation analysis, the emotional expression of imagery word closest to the filter are obtained, and a new filter naming mechanism is gotten. Finally, through a comparative experiment we can see that the new filter naming mechanism can greatly improve the users\u2019 cognitive efficiency and their experience. This study not only fills the blanks in the field of filter naming research, but provides a new research idea for deeper research on user\u2019s emotional expression and its stimulating factors.

        "abstract": "\u201cCloud Pet Keeping\u201d is a phenomenon rising in Chinese UGC background that social media users keep eyes on certain pets\u2019 growth by viewing the pictures and vocabularies released by pet bloggers. In the \u201ccloud pet keeping\u201d phenomenon, users can get emotional resonance through browsing the amusing pet photos shared by bloggers and are willing to contribute the consuming behavior. However, in the actual process of photos searching, users often fail to find the accurate content, as the users\u2019 tags are different from the tags input by bloggers, leading to the bad user experience. It shows that the differences may exist in the expressions of emotional cognition between bloggers and the users. This paper focuses on whether there are differences or not, and the detailed information may exist. For the analysis methods, first stimulus was chosen and associated emotional expression vocabularies were found through brainstorming. Then final emotional expression vocabularies were organized and extracted by SPSS cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling analysis. By calculating Euclidean distance with data from matching experiments of Emotional expression vocabularies and stimulus, the differences are obtained. The result indicated that there are differences existed between the bloggers and the users\u2019 expressions and it is apparent. The reason may be that bloggers do not systematically study the information contained in the photo when uploading. Also, users\u2019 individual differences and other factors impact the results of this study. Following research will focus on how to provide a tag selection mechanism on photo-sharing social media, to provide a better user experience.",

JE samples were obtained from healthy bicuspid premolars or third morlars for orthodontic or impaction reasons and the cells were cultured in the same way as LJE. The two types of cells were compared in cell morphology, dimension,viability, proliferation, apoptosis and cytokeratin expression by means of cytoanalyzer, confocal laser scanning microscope and flowcytometry. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS11.5 software package for independent-samples t test.LJE and JE cells exhibited similar cell morphology. Although the viability of LJE cells were lower than JE cells, there were no statistical significance (P>0.05). The mean diameter and volume of LJE cells were (19.03+/-0.19)microm and (4.29+/-0.19)x10(3) fL versus (17.16+/-0.95)microm and (3.20+/-0.52)x10(3)fL of JE cells (P<0.05). The doubling time of LJE cells, was longer than that of JE cells.CK19 expression of LJE cells was weaker than of JE cells and there were no difference in the expression pattern of CK6 and CK13.

        "abstract": "In the Chinese aesthetic experience, Daqi is an important and representative emotional experience. However, it is not easy to express the Daqi in appropriate words. As the concept of complexity, how to measure and what is the concrete composition of Daqi are the focus of this paper. Based on cognitive integration of Daqi, this paper puts forward the quantitative research method of human emotional experience. This method first uses the text analysis to extract the representative vocabularies as the Daqi measurement indicators. Then Professional researchers grade the stimulants of the Daqi of multiple dimensions, calculate the proportion of Daqi indicators by SPSS factor analysis, and get a formula of Daqi. Finally, this formula is tested and refined by large-scale stimulus experiments. Cognitive quantitative method of emotional experience of Daqi is different from the previous emotional behavior analysis method and more conducive to analyze the deep causes and stimulating factors of emotion, enriching the depth and breadth of the emotional experience experiment. While the quantitative formula established by the research can be applied to product and visual design, sociology research and other specific areas, playing a guiding and testing role.",

        "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the clinical efficacy and toxicity of priming induction regimen of CAG for newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) in elderly patients. Methods Seventy-five patients with newly diagnosed AML were divided into 2 groups: 34 were treated with priming induction regimen CAG and the other 41 were treated with 2 classic routine chemotherapy regimens including pirarubicin + cytarabin (TA) and homoharringtonine + cytarabine (HA). All patients had a 14 day interval between the 2 courses of chemotherapy. Results The complete remission rate after 2 courses of induction therapy in patients with the priming induction regimen CAG and the total efficacy rate was significantly higher than that of the routine chemotherapy patients (67. 6% vs. 39%; 82.4% vs. 56.1%). Patients with unfavorable karyotypes had poor chemotherapy efficacy. The 3-year disease -free-survival (DFS) time was longer in patients with AML treated with priming induction regimen CAG than in patients treated with 2 classic routine chemotherapy regimens. Except for the muscular soreness, the hematological and non-hematological side effects in the CAG priming induction group were significantly fewer than those in the routine chemotherapy group. Conclusion The priming induction regimen of CAG has a significantly higher complete remission rate and an efficacy rate, fewer side effects, milder chemotherapy intensity and is more sensitive to chemotherapeutic drugs than those of the routine chemotherapy. It can shorten the duration of agranulocytosis and decrease infectious complications and increase the sensitivity of leukemia blast cells to chemotherapeutic drugs.",

The recognition properties of the probe RS with Hg2+ ions had been investigated in EtOH-HEPES buffer solution (V:V=1:1, pH=7.3) by the ultraviolet spectrophotometry and the fluorescence spectrophotometry. The results showed that the recognition is instantaneous and reversible. Upon the addition of Hg2+, the spirolactam ring of probe RS was opened and 1:1 ligand-mercury complex was formed. The fluorescence imaging experiments of Hg2+ in L929 living cells demonstrated that the probe RS could be used in biological systems. \u00a9 2013 Chinese Chemical Society & SIOC, CAS.",
