        "abstract": "To determine the target intraocular pressure (IOP) level in normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) for visual field (VF) stability following trabeculectomy.Forty eyes of 40 patients who underwent trabeculectomy were enrolled in this study. Progression was determined by a decrease in the Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study VF defect score of four or more points. The Kaplan-Meier life table method was employed to compare the postoperative VF stability with predetermined IOP levels.The mean postoperative follow-up period was 12 years. At the final visit, the IOP was reduced from 15.2 to 9.4 mmHg on average (P < 0.0001). Reductions in IOP of 20% from baseline were achieved in 70.0% of eyes. The cumulative probability of VF stability was 92.7% in patients having an IOP reduction of >20%, whereas all patients in the poorly controlled IOP group showed progression (P < 0.0001). When IOP values of 9, 10, 11, and 12 mmHg were employed as the cutoff, the best VF prognosis was attained in eyes with a postoperative IOP of 10 mmHg.An IOP reduction of at least 20% from baseline or IOP <or=10 mmHg is recommended as the target postoperative IOP in progressive NTG.",

We demonstrated that co-expression of CD8/zeta and Syk were necessary for NF-AT activation in 293T. This NF-AT response was completely inhibited by the addition of cyclosporin A or FK506, but markedly enhanced by the additional expression of Tec protein tyrosine kinase. We also show that the cytokine signaling suppressor, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1, potently inhibited this response by interacting with Syk and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs in CD8/zeta. These results imply that this novel system may provide a useful tool to delineate or identify the regulatory molecules for CD3zeta/Syk-mediated NF-AT activation.",

Recently, we demonstrated that Tyk2 is directly involved in IFN signaling for the induction and translocation of Daxx, which may result in growth arrest and/or apoptosis of B lymphocyte progenitors. To clarify how Daxx regulates B cell development, we examined Daxx interacting partners by yeast two-hybrid screening. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)-associated protein (DMAP1) was identified and demonstrated to interact with Daxx. The interaction regions in both proteins were mapped, and the cellular localization of the interaction was examined. Both Daxx and DMAP1 formed a complex with DNMT1 and colocalized in the nucleus. DMAP1 enhanced Daxx-mediated repression of glucocorticoid receptor transcriptional activity. Furthermore, Daxx protected protein degradation of DMAP1 in vivo. These results provide the novel molecular link between Daxx and DNMT1, which establishes a repressive transcription complex in the nucleus.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   We investigated the influence of Al contents on the structural, electrical and optical properties of Al-doped ZnO (AZO) polycrystalline films with the columnar grain structures. In addition, we demonstrated an effective way for achieving improved Hall mobility AZO films at any given Al contents. We deposited 500-nm-thick AZO films on glass substrates at a substrate temperature of 200 °C by direct-current magnetron sputtering with a direct-current power of 200 W. The oxide targets were high-density sintered AZO targets with Al 2 O 3  contents from 0.5 to 3.0 wt%. Analysis of the data obtained by X-ray diffraction and Hall effect measurements showed that an increase in the Al 2 O 3  contents resulted in an increase in volume fraction of (0001) orientation ( V  (0001) ) from 85 to 98% and in carrier concentration of the AZO films. The use of a 10-nm-thick Ga-doped ZnO film deposited by ion plating with direct-current arc discharge as an interface layer between the glass substrate and a thick AZO film drastically changed the above behavior of the orientation distribution limited by the Al 2 O 3  contents. We found the  V  (0001)  of about 99% at any given Al 2 O 3  content. The resulting well-defined (0001) crystallographic orientation led to very small contribution of grain boundary scattering to carrier transport. Hall mobility of AZO films with the very thin interface layer was improved with enhanced carrier concentration as a result.",

        "abstract": "For the realization of future wireless networks, gigabit wireless technology, which\n         can achieve higher‐than‐1 Gbps data transmission with extremely low transmit power,\n         is indispensable. We have been studying the distributed antenna network (DAN) and\n         the frequency domain wireless signal processing. In DAN, many antennas or clusters\n         of antennas are spatially distributed over a service area, and they are connected\n         by means of optical fiber links with DAN signal processing center. A number of distributed\n         antennas cooperatively serve mobile users using spatial multiplexing, diversity, array,\n         or relaying technique. In this paper, the recent advances in single‐carrier DAN are\n         introduced. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n      ",

For the type A blade with inside cylinder and four blades, the 50% cut size decreases with the increase of inside cylinder diameter. The pressure drop of the type A blade increases as the inside diameter increases, especially diameter ratio greater than 0.8. The new blade of type B with inside cylinder, four blades and special rings on the inside cylinder shows higher particle separation efficiency and low pressure drop compared with the type A blade.  The experimental partial separation efficiency qualitatively agreed with the numerical simulation results.",

Patients with a recorded maximum intraocular pressure (IOP) of 22 mmHg or greater were classified as POAG, and those with an IOP of 21 mmHg or less were classified as NTG.Multiple regression analysis was used to study the influence of refraction on 12 central test points of the C30-2 Humphrey program, and the differences in visual field defects between POAG and NTG eyes were examined using logistic discriminant analysis. In the multiple regression analysis, total deviation (TD) of the 12 test points was graded and used as the dependent variable, and MD and the spherical equivalent refraction were the explanatory variables. In the logistic discrimination analysis, TD, MD, and refraction were covariants that determined the OAG subtypes.TD values of the 12 central test points (C30-2 program).Higher myopic refraction was significantly associated with more damage at a point just temporal and inferior to the fixation point in POAG eyes, whereas it was significantly associated with less damage at test points just temporal and superior to the fixation point in NTG eyes. After correcting for the influence of refraction, POAG eyes had significantly more damage at a test point just temporal and inferior to the fixation point, whereas NTG eyes had significantly more damage at those test points nasal and inferior to the fixation point.High myopia constitutes a threat to the remaining lower cecocentral visual field and is one of the factors that interfere with the quality of vision in advanced OAG with high IOP but not low IOP.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine whether significant correlations existed between the morphological and functional parameters of the macular region of eyes with open-angle glaucoma (OAG). METHODS: Forty eyes of 40 OAG patients were studied. The morphological parameters were obtained by optical coherence tomography (OCT), and the functional parameters were acquired by automated Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) and multifocal electroretinograms (mfERGs). All of the tests were performed within 6 months of each other. The retinal thickness was determined by OCT in the nine Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) sectors of the macula, the fovea, and the four quadrants of the inner and an outer ring. The amplitudes of the second-order kernel responses of the mfERGs in the central 5° including the amplitude ratio of the nasal to temporal hemispheres (N/T amplitude ratio) were analyzed. The total mean deviation of the HFA corresponding to each OCT region was measured. The correlation between the different parameters was determined by coefficients of correlation and linear regression analyses. RESULTS: The N/T amplitude ratio of the second-order kernel responses of the mfERGs was significantly correlated with the retinal thickness in the inferior quadrant (r = -0.44; P = 0.004). There was a significant correlation between the N/T amplitude ratio and the threshold in the superior quadrant measured by the HFA Central 10-2 program (r = -0.40; P = 0.011) and also between the N/T amplitude ratio and the total deviation in the superior quadrant (r = -0.40; P = 0.010). There were significant correlations between the inferior retinal thickness and the average threshold and the TD in superior (r = 0.70, P < 0.001; r = 0.692, P < 0.001, respectively), nasal (r = 0.53, P < 0.001; r = 0.53, P < 0.001, respectively), and temporal (r = 0.46, P = 0.003; r = 0.44, P = 0.004, respectively) quadrants. CONCLUSIONS: Functional glaucomatous changes determined by mfERGs and perimetry are significantly correlated with the morphological changes determined by OCT.",

The crystallized hydrogel from incineration fly ash had a lower electric conductivity and a lower crystallinity than that from calcium carbonate reagent. However, the difference in electric conductivity between these crystallized hydrogels decreases with temperature. This was due to the presence of potassium in the incineration fly ash. The fuel cell with a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) using the calcium phosphate hydrogel membrane prepared from incineration fly ash was observed to generate electricity. The performance of this fuel cell was almost equal to that of a mixture of K(2)CO(3) and CaCO(3) reagents; further, the performance of the former was superior to the fuel cell with a perfluorosulfonic polymer membrane at temperatures greater than approximately 85 degrees C.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A new  11 Be(   d  ,  p   ) 12 Be transfer reaction experiment was carried out in inverse kinematics at 26.9 A  MeV, with special efforts devoted to the determination of the deuteron target thickness and of the required optical potentials from the present elastic scattering data. In addition a direct measurement of the cross section for the        0    2      +      state was realized by applying an isomer-tagging technique. The  s -wave spectroscopic factors of      0.20    −  0.04    +  0.03      and      0.41    −  0.11    +  0.11      were extracted for the      0    1    +      and      0    2    +      states, respectively, in  12 Be. Using the ratio of these spectroscopic factors, together with the previously reported results for the  p -wave components, the single-particle component intensities in the bound      0    +      states of  12 Be were deduced, allowing a direct comparison with the theoretical predictions. It is evidenced that the ground-state configuration of  12 Be is dominated by the  d -wave intruder, exhibiting a dramatic evolution of the intruding mechanism from  11 Be to  12 Be, with a persistence of the    N  =  8    magic number broken.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical features of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome caused by FOXC1 mutations in Japanese patients.After informed consent was obtained, genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood. The DNA-sequence changes were analyzed using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and automated sequencing in six Japanese probands with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome.The authors identified four mutations: pedigree 1 (26-47ins22), 2 (Ile91Ser), 3 (286ins1), and 4 (Arg127His). Two pedigrees showed new mutations in FOXC1. In pedigrees 1,2, and 4, younger generations had iris hypoplasia with severe early-onset glaucoma, whereas their parents had posterior embryotoxon without glaucoma. Pedigree 3 had a single affected person with iris hypoplasia and posterior embryotoxon with a mild increase of intraocular pressure.Four different FOXC1 mutations were found in four of six Japanese pedigrees with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome. This was a new mutation in two pedigrees that was not found in earlier generations. This study confirms that mutations in this gene cause maldevelopment of the anterior segment of the eye.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers for emergent large vessel occlusion has been proved by randomized trials. Mechanical thrombectomy is increasingly being adopted in Japan since stent retrievers were first approved in 2014. An urgent clinical task is to offer structured systems of care to provide this treatment in a timely fashion to all patients with emergent large vessel occlusion. Treatment with flow-diverting stents is currently a preferred treatment option worldwide for large and giant unruptured aneurysms. Initial studies reported high rates of complete aneurysm occlusion, even in large and giant aneurysms, without delayed aneurysmal recanalization and/or growth. The Pipeline Embolic Device is a flow diverter recently approved in Japan for the treatment of large and giant wide-neck unruptured aneurysms in the internal carotid artery, from the petrous to superior hypophyseal segments. Carotid artery stenting is the preferred treatment approach for carotid stenosis in Japan, whereas it remains an alternative for carotid endarterectomy in Europe and the United States. Carotid artery stenting with embolic protection and plaque imaging is effective in achieving favorable outcomes. The design and conclusions of a randomized trial of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (ARUBA) trial, which compared medical management alone and medical management with interventional therapy in patients with an unruptured arteriovenous brain malformation, are controversial. However, the annual bleeding rate (2.2%) of the medical management group obtained from this study is worthy of consideration when deciding treatment strategy.",

In this paper, we propose the use of the training sequenceaided SC (TA-SC) block transmission instead of CP-SC block transmission.

        "title": "Effect of substrate temperature on structural, electrical and optical properties of Ga-doped ZnO films on cycro olefin polymer substrate by ion plating deposition",
        "abstract": "The dependences of the structural, electrical and optical properties of transparent conductive Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) films with a thickness of 100 nm on the unheated cyclo olefin polymer (COP) and alkali-free glass substrate temperatures has been studied. GZO films were prepared on substrates by ion plating deposition with direct-current arc discharge. The substrate temperature rises with longer plasma exposure time. By controlling the time of exposure to plasma such that the substrate temperature does not exceed 100 °C, highly transparent conductive GZO with the resistivity of less than 7 × 10 − 4  Ω cm on COP and glass substrates can be obtained. Keywords TCO ZnO GZO COP 1 Introduction Highly transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) on a glass substrate are used in optoelectronic devices such as flat panel displays (FPDs) and solar cells. Sn-doped In 2 O 3 (ITO) has been widely used as a TCO because it has low resistivity and high transmittance. The crystallization temperature of ITO is about 350 °C. When the substrate temperature is below the crystallization temperature, ITO becomes amorphous and has high resistivity. On the other hand, GZO film has been expected to be an alternative material of ITO because it is similar to ITO in its electrical and optical properties [1–6] . The advantage of GZO films over ITO is its low crystallization temperature. In recent years, polymer substrates have been replacing glass substrates in a wide range of areas because of their low cost, light weight, small thickness, impact resistance and flexibility. The optoelectronic field is no exception. To realize flexible devices such as flexible displays and electronic paper, TCOs on polymer substrates are requisite. When TCO on plastic substrates are prepared, the process temperature is the most important factor determining the quality of TCO films. However, the low heat resistance of plastic substrates limits the process temperature. The deposition process is controlled so that the temperature of a plastic substrate is below the glass transition temperature ( T g ) and/or heat distortion temperature (HDT). Very recently, cycle olefin polymer (COP) has been applied as a multipurpose transparent engineering plastic in light guide plates and in the camera of mobile phones. It offers a wide range of heat resistance (100 to 160 °C) with a high total light transmittance of 92%. In this work, we use a COP substrate with T g = 160 °C and HDT = 161 °C. Note that it has a markedly low water absorption value of less than 0.01% compared with PC (0.2%) and PMMA (0.3%). Thus, it enables the deposition of GZO films directly on substrates without a buffer layer to overcome the influences of outgasing, including water, from the substrates. In this work, GZO films were deposited on plastic substrates by ion-plating deposition with direct-current (DC) arc discharge. This deposition method is a practical technique with a high deposition rate. However, in this system, during deposition, the substrate temperature rises as a result of plasma exposure. First, we investigate the effects of plasma exposure time on COP substrate temperature. Then, GZO films are deposited by controlling the plasma exposure time so that the temperature of COP substrate is below T g [7] . Under such a deposition condition, we study the dependences of the structural, electrical and optical characteristics of GZO films on COP substrate temperature. 2 Experimental GZO films were deposited on 2-mm-thick COP and 0.7-mm-thick alkali-free glass with a thickness of substrates by ion-plating deposition with DC arc discharge, as shown Fig. 1 . The deposition system is composed of a pressure-gradient arc plasma source (Uramoto (Ur) gun, see Fig. 1 ) at the cathode, a plasma beam controller around the anode (hearth), and a substrate holder. This method enables the deposition of GZO films at a high rate (typically, 170 nm/min at a substrate temperature of 200 °C). The evaporation source is sintered ceramic ZnO targets (99.99% pure, HAKUSUI Tech.) containing 4 wt.% Ga 2 O 3 . The deposition conditions are listed in Table 1 . The item, Number of passages, in the table indicates the total number of deposition counts for obtaining GZO films of a thickness of 100 nm. The temperature of the substrates was measured using a thermocouple. The structural properties of the GZO films were determined by high resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD, a Rigaku ATX-G) and glazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) with Cu Kα radiation (wavelength λ = 0.154 nm). In the case of this in-plane GIXRD measurement, the angle of incidence was set to 0.35° and scattered X-ray intensity was monitored as a function of 2θχ angle. Lattice planes oriented parallel and perpendicular to the surface were detected by out-of-plane (2θ − θ) and in-plane (2θχ−ϕ) scan, respectively. The electrical properties of the GZO films were determined using a four-point probe by NPS Σ-5. Optical transmittance measurement was performed with a Hitachi U-4100 spectrophotometer. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Substrate temperature The substrate temperature is one of the most important factors governing the structural and electrical and optical properties of GZO films on substrates. No intentional cooling was applied to the substrate. Thus the substrate temperature rises with the plasma exposure time. Fig. 2 shows the surface temperature, T ss , of COP substrates as a function of plasma exposure time. It indicates that T ss increases with plasma exposure time, reaching 89 °C with 70 s of plasma exposure. We note that the maximum T ss was below the glass transition temperature ( T g = 160 °C) and heat distortion temperature (161 °C) of COP substrates. On the other hand, the COP substrate with a thickness of 0.1 mm was found to be deformed upon exposure to plasma for 35 s. We use T ss described above as the substrate temperature T s in the following. 3.2 Structural properties Fig. 3 shows in-plane XRD patterns of GZO films on the COP and glass substrates at T s of 53 °C. The XRD patterns for all GZO films are identical to that for the hexagonal phase of wurtzite structure. No Ga 2 O 3 phase was detected in the X-ray patterns. The three peaks of (100), (110), and (200) orientation planes were observed for GZO films on the two different substrates. For GZO films on glass substrates, out-of-plane XRD patterns show that the (00  l ) family of peaks strongly appears. This indicates that GZO films on glass substrates have a very high level of orientation along the c -axis direction vertical to the substrate. On the other hand, the (101), and (201) diffraction peaks were also observed for the GZO films on the COP substrate. Such experimental evidence indicates that the low-temperature deposition of GZO films on COP substrates gives rise to a deterioration of the quality of the films. Note that the surface roughness of the COP substrates may affect the quality of GZO films. The analysis of data obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM) shows that the average surface roughness, R a , of glass and COP substrates is 0.4 nm and about 4 nm, respectively. Fig. 4 shows the dependences of (a) the c - and (b) a -axis lattice constants and (c) the volume of a crystallographic unit cell of GZO films on different substrates as a function of T s . The lattice constants were calculated from the peak positions of GZO (002) and (100) diffraction peaks. The volume was calculated from the lattice constants described above. Figure (a), (b) show a behavior of difference in lattice constants between GZO films on glass and COP substrates. The differences increased with increasing T s . As a result, a difference in volume between GZO films on glass and COP substrates had a maximum at T s = 89 °C. The behavior of difference in the lattice constants and volume described above can be explained in terms of the difference in thermal expansion coefficients between glass (3.7 × 10 − 6 /°C) and COP (6 × 10 − 5 /°C) substrates. The thermal expansion coefficient is a very important value in analyzing the thermal deformation behavior. For GZO films on COP substrates, after deposition, they were subjected to strong compressive stress in the direction parallel to the substrate because of the COP substrate with a large thermal expansion coefficient, unlike GZO films on glass substrates, which have a small thermal expansion coefficient near GZO. As a result, the a -axis lattice constants of GZO on COP substrates became shorter than those of GZO films on glass substrates at any given T s . According to it, the c -axis lattice constants of GZO films on COP substrates become larger than those of GZO films on glass substrates. 3.3 Electrical properties Fig. 5 shows the resistivity, ρ , of the GZO films on COP and glass substrates as a function of T s . The ρ is calculated from the sheet resistance determined using four-point probe and the film thickness. The ρ of the GZO films on the COP substrate was slightly higher than that of GZO films on the glass substrate at any given T s . The ρ of the GZO films on both substrates showed almost the same behavior of decreasing with increasing T s . For GZO films on COP substrates, the minimum ρ is 5.92 × 10 − 4  Ω cm at T s = 89 °C and the maximum ρ is as low as 6.90 × 10 − 4  Ω cm at T s = 53 °C, which is low enough for use in electrodes. The results show that a GZO film with low resistivity of less than 7.0 × 10 − 4  Ω cm can be obtained on a COP substrate by controlling T s . 3.4 Optical properties Fig. 6 shows the optical transmittance spectra of the GZO films on COP and glass substrates, and those of the two substrates alone in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible (VIS) regions. The COP substrate with an index of refraction of 1.53 has high transmittance (91%) and very little absorption (< 1%) in the VIS region. For all film thicknesses, the transmittance fell off rather abruptly in the UV region, i.e., at wavelengths below 380 nm. This is attributable to the strong absorption due to the excitation across the fundamental band gap. For all GZO films, we observed a broad dip in the VIS region, which is due to the multiple interference of the light reflected at the surface and at the interface between the GZO thin films having an estimated refractive index of ∼ 2.0 and the substrates having a refractive index of approximately 1.51–1.53. The observed interference effect proves that the GZO films on the glass and COP substrates are reasonably flat. The mean transmittance in the VIS region (400 nm–800 nm) and the transmittance at a wavelength of 550 nm of the GZO films on the COP substrate were above 86% and 84%, respectively. The maximum transmittance of the GZO films on the COP substrate was measured to be nearly 90% at around 435 nm. This finding indicates that GZO films with a high transmittance of more than 80% in the VIS region can be obtained even if the substrate temperature is less than 100 °C. 4 Conclusion Highly transparent conductive GZO films on COP and glass substrates at low substrate temperatures of less than 100 °C can be obtained. GZO films were prepared by ion-plating deposition with DC arc discharge. Films were deposited at different substrate temperatures by controlling the plasma exposure time such that the temperature of the COP substrate was less than 100°C, which is below T g . The analysis of the XRD patterns of all GZO films on the two different substrates indicated polycrystalline GZO films of wurtzite structure with preferred orientation along the c -axis. The ρ of the GZO films with a thickness of 100 nm on COP substrates decreased with increasing substrate temperature and reached 6.90 × 10 − 4  Ω cm (at T s = 53 °C) to 5.92 × 10 − 4  Ω cm (at T s = 89 °C). All the GZO films on glass and COP substrates at different substrate temperatures exhibit more than 84% optical transparency in the VIS region. All the GZO films exhibited very good adhesion to the two different substrates. References [1] S. Soga T. Yamamoto K. Kohno H. Imai M. Yamamoto S. Shirai T. Yamada A. Miyake H. Makino S.

In addition, the IFN-alpha-induced up-regulation and nuclear translocation of Daxx are completely abrogated in the absence of tyk2. Therefore, tyk2 is directly involved in IFN-alpha signaling for the induction and translocation of Daxx, which may result in B lymphocyte growth arrest and/or apoptosis.",

It is found that the cut size of a centrifugal separator decreases as the rotational speed increases and the liquid flow rate decreases. Fitting our experimental results with the theory, they agree with each other at high flow rate. However, the difference between them generates at low flow rate. This is because dead spaces are generated in the centrifugal separator at the low flow rate. Also, the computer simulation of the fluid behavior in the centrifugal separator can find the decrease of the velocity near the wall under the low flow rate, which suggests the possibility of the formation of dead spaces in the separator.",

A new theoretical equation to calculate fundamental uncertainty region in the case that the maximum and/or the minimum particle size is known, is derived based on a log-normal distribution truncated by the maximum and/or the minimum. Fundamental uncertainty regions calculated based on these truncated size distributions are compared with that calculated based on the perfect log-normal distribution. The relationship between the parameter u to determine the reliability of size distribution and the truncate-parameter g is obtained to get 95% reliability of the measurement. Value of the parameter u is fairly reduced as the truncate-parameter g becomes smaller. Numerical simulation of uncertainty region agreed with the results calculated by the new theoretical equation. Calculations on the silica particles having a size range of 0.1–1 μm have been conducted showing that the uncertainty region based on the known maximum size is slightly smaller compared to that given in the previous paper.

        "abstract": "The effect of thermal annealing on the electrical properties of highly transparent conductive Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) films deposited on glass substrates at 200 °C by an ion-plating deposition was investigated. GZO films were annealed in the temperature range from 200 to 600 °C for 30 min under the atmospheric pressure of high-purity N 2 gas. Up to 300 °C, GZO films were electrically very stable, and there was little change in resistivity. When the annealing temperature exceeded 400 °C, resistivity increased rapidly, originating from an abrupt decrease in carrier concentration. It was suggested to be due to both desorption of Zn from GZO films and grain boundary segregation of Ga dopants.",

However, many PLGG cases are unresectable and some of them undergo tumor progression. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary to treat PLGG patients. Recent genomic analysis revealed a broad genomic landscape underlying PLGG. Notably, the majority of PLGGs present MAPK pathway-associated genomic alterations and MAPK signaling-dependent tumor progression. Following preclinical evidence, many clinical trials based on molecular target therapy have been conducted on PLGG patients, some of whom exhibited durable response to target therapy. Here, we provide an overview of PLGG genetics and the evidence supporting the application of molecular target therapy in these patients.",

        "abstract": "We investigated in a prospective fashion the visual prognosis and complications in normal-tension glaucoma following unilateral trabeculectomy with adjunctive mitomycin C.Trabeculectomy with adjunctive mitomycin C was carried out unilaterally in 21 cases of normal-tension glaucoma. Intraocular pressure (IOP), visual prognosis, and complications were compared between the operated eyes and the non-operated fellow eyes. The follow-up period ranged from 2 to 7 years.The IOP dropped significantly from 14.8+/-1.8 mmHg (mean +/- SD) to 9.6+/-3.9 mmHg in the operated eyes (P=0.0002, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), but did not drop in the non-operated eyes. The mean deviation (MD) was -12.69+/-6.41 dB preoperatively and -14.70+/-5.49 dB at the last clinic visit in the operated eyes, whereas in non-operated eyes it was -7.85+/-5.65 dB and -11.15+/-5.62 dB, respectively. The MD deteriorated significantly in both operated and non-operated eyes (operated eyes P=0.0239, non-operated eyes: P=0.0002; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The MD slope was -0.37+/-0.60 dB/year and -0.71+/-0.89 dB/year for the operated and non-operated eyes, respectively (P=0.5243, Mann-Whitney U-test). Visual field deterioration was more frequently observed in the non-operated eyes by a pointwise definition of the progression (P<0.05, McNemar test). Visual acuity deteriorated in 6 of the operated eyes and in 5 of the non-operated eyes. Cataract developed in 6 (29%) of the 21 operated eyes, while among the non-operated eyes 4 (19%) developed cataract.Mitomycin C trabeculectomy is effective in delaying progression of visual field defect in normal-tension glaucoma, but complications may arise and cause some visual disturbance.",

In all, 36 eyes of 36 patients who underwent TSYLC for the first time and 80 eyes of 75 patients who underwent cyclocryotherapy for the first time were included in the present study. The follow-up averaged 9.2 months (range, 1-21 months) in patients receiving cyclocryotherapy. In patients with a preoperative visual acuity of greater than or equal to 0.01, the successful control of IOP was represented by a value of less than 21 mmHg that was obtained without additional medication, and that in patients who had a visual acuity of less than 0.01 was represented by a decrease in IOP of at least 25%, also obtained without additional medication. The success rate of the TSYLC-treated group at 21 months after treatment was 45.2% +/- 11.7%, whereas that of the group receiving cyclocryotherapy was 38.9% +/- 6.1%. The difference between these success rates was not statistically significant (P greater than 0.05). Complications such as phthisis bulbi, hypotony, hemorrhage in the anterior chamber or swelling of the eyelids were less frequent in the TSYLC-treated group than in the group given cyclocryotherapy. TSYLC is thought to be as effective as cyclocryotherapy in lowering IOP, but with fewer complications.",

        "abstract": "Background  Recent genetic analysis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) showed that the MyD88 L265P mutation, which is related to NF-κB signaling, was a genetic hallmark for PCNSL; thus it could serve as a genetic marker for diagnosis and a potential target for molecular therapy. However, the role of the MyD88 mutation in PCNSL has not been defined. In this study, we investigated the role of the MyD88 mutation and clinical features of PCNSL-treated patients at several institutions to determine its significance as a prognostic factor.    Methods  Forty-one PCNSL (diffuse large B-cell type) patients from 8 institutions were included in this study. Their median age was 68 years; median follow-up was 26.7 months; median overall survival was 26.7 months; and their 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates were 75.6%, 58.5%, and 43.9%, respectively. Deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from frozen tissue, and the MyD88 L265P mutation was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing.    Results  The MyD88 L265P mutation was found in 61.0% (25/41) of cases. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that neither MyD88 L265P mutation nor age u003e65 years alone significantly predicted overall survival relative to MyD88 wild type and age  65 years. Among age u003e65 patients, the MyD88 L265P mutation portended a worse overall survival compared with the MyD88 wild type (11.5 vs. 56.2 months  P      Conclusion  The MyD88 L265P mutation predicted a poor prognosis in elderly PCNSL patients. A new tailor-made treatment strategy might be needed for these patients.",

In this study, we examined the factors influencing optic disc parameters and hemisphere symmetry obtained with the HRT in normal Japanese subjects.Mean values and the standard deviation range for the main HRT parameters were evaluated in 223 eyes of 223 normal Japanese subjects. The influence of age, sex, and disc size on HRT topographic data was analyzed. The superior and inferior hemisphere topographic parameters were compared.Disc area showed a significant difference by sex (P = 0.0493). Rim volume (r = -0.208, P = 0.019), height variation contour (r = -0.275, P = 0.001), and mean retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness (r = -0.366, P = 0.001) declined with age. All parameters except height variation contour and mean RNFL thickness showed a clinically significant correlation with disc size (-0.159 < r < 0.719, P < 0.01). Cup parameters in the superior hemisphere were significantly greater than those in the inferior hemisphere. In contrast, rim parameters in the superior hemisphere were significantly smaller than those in the inferior hemisphere.Some factors, namely, sex, age, and disc size, affected the optic disc parameters in the HRT measurements. Possible parameter asymmetry between the two hemispheres should be considered in normal eyes.",

All HRT parameters were strongly or moderately correlated between right and left eyes (Pearson's correlation coefficients = 0.45-0.83, P<0.001). Absolute inter-eye differences in several HRT parameters were positively correlated with disc area (P<0.05). Multiple regression analyses adjusting for the confounders showed weak but significant correlations of height, refractive error, IOP, and CCT with several HRT parameters (partial correlation coefficient (absolute value) = 0.04-0.16, P<0.05), and moderate or weak but significant correlations of disc area with all HRT parameters (partial correlation coefficient [absolute value] = 0.05-0.73, P<0.05). Gender, weight, blood pressure, and ocular perfusion pressure did not significantly correlate with HRT parameters.This report presents reference data of normality for the HRT parameters based on a large sample of normal Japanese subjects.

Crush injury was unilaterally produced by clipping the optic nerve 2 mm behind the globe. RGC density was estimated by counting fluorescent dye-labeled cells in the flatmount of the retina. The optic nerve damage in the crush model was also evaluated histologically.In the elevated IOP model, RGC survival decreased to 72.9% +/- 3.8% (mean +/- SEM) of that of the contralateral control eye on the eighth day after laser irradiation. Repeated treatments with T-588 at 30 mg/kg twice daily significantly enhanced RGC survival (86.0% +/- 2.2%, P = 0.0242) without the reduction of IOP. In the optic nerve crush model, RGC survival diminished to 37.2% +/- 8.4% of that of the contralateral control eye after 4 weeks. Repeated applications with T-588 at 10 mg/kg twice daily significantly enhanced RGC survival (77.8% +/- 2.1%, P = 0.0038). Histologically, the rat optic nerve in the group treated with T-588 at 10 mg/kg retained a near-normal morphology.T-588 has a neuroprotective effect against RGC death caused by elevated IOP and optic nerve crush in the rat.",

        "abstract": "Clinical studies have shown hyperuricemia strongly associated with insulin resistance as well as cardiovascular disease. Direct evidence of how high uric acid (HUA) affects insulin resistance in cardiomyocytes, but the pathological mechanism of HUA associated with cardiovascular disease remains to be clarified. We aimed to examine the effect of HUA on insulin sensitivity in cardiomyocytes and on insulin resistance in hyperuricemic mouse model. We exposed primary cardiomyocytes and a rat cardiomyocyte cell line, H9c2 cardiomyocytes, to HUA, then quantified glucose uptake with a fluorescent glucose analog, 2-NBDG, after insulin challenge and detected reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Western blot analysis was used to examine the levels of insulin receptor (IR), phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1, Ser307) and phospho-Akt (Ser473). We monitored the impact of HUA on insulin resistance, insulin signaling and IR, phospho-IRS1 (Ser307) and phospho-Akt levels in myocardial tissue of an acute hyperuricemia mouse model established by potassium oxonate treatment. HUA inhibited insulin-induced glucose uptake in H9c2 and primary cardiomyocytes. It increased ROS production; pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger, reversed HUA-inhibited glucose uptake induced by insulin. HUA exposure directly increased the phospho-IRS1 (Ser307) response to insulin and inhibited that of phospho-Akt in H9C2 cardiomyocytes, which was blocked by NAC. Furthermore, the acute hyperuricemic mice model showed impaired glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance accompanied by increased phospho-IRS1 (Ser307) and inhibited phospho-Akt response to insulin in myocardial tissues. HUA inhibited insulin signaling and induced insulin resistance in cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo, which is a novel potential mechanism of hyperuricemic-related cardiovascular disease.",

For wireless packet communications, hybrid automatic repeat-request (HARQ) plays an important role as the error control technique to achieve a higher throughput performance. In this paper, we modify and optimize the joint Tx/Rx MMSE-FD filtering for its application to SC-MIMO spatial multiplexing and HARQ packet combining. At each retransmission of the same packet, joint Tx/Rx MMSE-FD filtering is carried out so as to minimize the MSE after packet combining. Computer simulation results show that joint Tx/Rx MMSE-FD filtering offers an improved throughput performance compared to the conventional Rx MMSE-FD filtering.",

There is evidence that maximal resection of neoplasm provides optimal conditions for enhancement of the tumor-specific immune reactions induced by vaccine administration, and thus aggressive surgery may be an important prerequisite for treatment success. Irradiation and chemotherapy may also enhance the effectiveness of vaccines, particularly through modulation of the tumor microenvironment. Nevertheless, the most effective combinations of vaccine therapies with surgery, irradiation, chemotherapy, antiangiogenic therapy, or other modes of immunotherapy in cases of HGG are still unclear and likely to be an active area of research in the future.",

An image field of 15 degrees x 15 degrees or 20 degrees x 20 degrees was used for the NFLD analysis. Data on the nerve fiber layer thickness was collected and further analyzed circumferentially across the NFLD at a position 500 microm away from the optic disc margin. We studied 31 patients with early to moderate open-angle glaucoma, ie, with visual field defects appearing earlier than stage 3 of the modified Aulhorn-Greve classification. We determined the width (W), maximum depth (D), and cross-sectional area of the NFLD (A), and we identified correlations between these parameters and the visual field indices from Humphrey Visual Field tests, mean deviation (MD) and corrected pattern standard deviation (CPSD).NFLD parameters could be obtained from 20 of 31 eyes (65%). There was a statistically significant correlation between the D and A parameters, and between these parameters and the maximum depression threshold in the corresponding visual field. No significant correlation was found between the NFLD parameters, the global visual field indices (MD, CPSD) and the mean value of the total deviation (TD) in the corresponding hemifield visual field.A cross-sectional NFLD image can be obtained using HRT. Among the three NFLD parameters, maximum depth (D), and area under the surface (A) correlated well with the visual field threshold.",

        "abstract": "The suction decompression (SD) method, which proactively aspirates the blood flowing into the aneurysm and reduces the internal pressure of the aneurysm, is useful for clipping surgery of large and giant cerebral aneurysm. However, there has been little discussion on re-utilization of blood aspirated during SD. This study aimed to examine the safety, convenience, and usefulness of autologous transfusion of aspirated blood using a transfusion bag. At the time of craniotomy, the cervical carotid artery is fully exposed. An angiocatheter sheath was inserted into the carotid artery and placed in the internal carotid artery. In SD, blood was aspirated from the sheath at a constant speed and quickly stored in a blood transfusion storage bag. Blood aspiration was repeated with a new syringe; once the transfusion bag was full, the blood was re-administered to the patient. Changes in vital sign and hemoglobin/hematocrit values before and after SD were examined in five cases performed in this procedure. The aspirated blood volumes of five cases ranged from 130 to 400 mL, and all aspirated blood was successfully re-transfused. There was no critical change in vital sign, and no significant decrease in the hemoglobin/hematocrit value. No findings suggestive of complications of thrombus formation, infection, and hemolysis were noted. Re-transfusion of aspirated blood during SD using a transfusion bag is a simple and safe method, which can minimize potential risk of re-utilizing aspirated blood, and enables the safe and easy execution of SD regardless of aspirated blood volume.",

D3]).Retinal, cell damage was induced by intravitreous injection of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA; 40 nmol/eye). Retinal MT-I, -II, and -III mRNA expression was monitored by real-time reverse-transcription-PCR of total retinal RNA from eyes injected or not injected with NMDA. In wild-type mice, MT-I and -II immunohistochemistry was performed (with antibody that recognizes both proteins) 12 and 24 hours after intravitreous NMDA injection. To examine the involvement of induced retinal MT, ZnSO4 (10 nmol/eye) or Vit. D3 (0.2 or 2 ng/eye) was intravitreously injected 24 hours before NMDA injection in wild-type or MT-I/-II-deficient mice, and ganglion cell layer (GCL) cell loss and inner plexiform layer (IPL) thinning were evaluated 7 days after the NMDA injection. The protective effect of Vit. D3 was assessed against the RGC-5 cell death induced by oxidative stress (using buthionine sulfoximine [BSO] to deplete glutathione in combination with glutamate to inhibit cystine uptake).In wild-type mice, MT-II mRNA expression was time-dependently elevated by NMDA (5.9 and 7.4 times versus the nontreated control at 4 and 12 hours, respectively, after injection), with the normal level being regained within 24 hours. In contrast, MT-I and -III showed persistent decreases (to <50% control) from 4 to 24 hours. In wild-type mice, MT-like immunoreactivity was increased in the inner retina (GCL and IPL) 12 and 24 hours after NMDA injection. At 7 days after NMDA injection in MT-I/-II-deficient mice (versus wild-type mice), GCL cell loss was increased, but IPL thickness was not different. Pretreatment with ZnSO4 or Vit. D3 increased inner retinal MT-like immunoreactivity 24 hours after NMDA injection and significantly attenuated NMDA-induced GCL cell loss in wild-type mice, but ZnSO4 pretreatment did not protect against such cell loss in MT-I/-II-deficient mice. In vitro, Vit. D3 pretreatment (100 nM) reduced BSO+glutamate-induced RGC-5 cell death.These findings suggest that MT, especially MT-II, protects against retinal neuron damage, by acting as an endogenous antioxidant.",

A total of 3021 residents (participation rate, 78.1%) participated.Each subject underwent screening examinations including autokeratorefractometry, subjective refraction, best-corrected visual acuity, central corneal thickness measurement, intraocular pressure measurement, slit-lamp examination, fundus photography, and visual field testing.The prevalence of myopia (spherical equivalent [SE], <-0.5 diopters [D]), high myopia (SE, <-5 D), hyperopia (SE, >0.5 D), refractive astigmatism (cylinder, >0.5 D), and anisometropia (difference in SE between eyes, >1.0 D), and the correlation of refractive errors with age, gender, and central corneal thickness. Astigmatism in the refraction and keratometry was analyzed using polar value analysis and the vector calculation method.The crude prevalence of myopia, high myopia, hyperopia, refractive astigmatism in the refraction, and anisometropia was 41.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40.0%-43.6%), 8.2% (95% CI, 7.2%-9.2%), 27.9% (95% CI, 26.3%-29.6%), 54.0% (95% CI, 52.1%-55.8%), and 15.1% (95% CI, 13.7%-16.4%), respectively. The prevalence of myopia decreased with age up to 70 to 79 years but increased slightly in patients 80 years and older; the prevalence of hyperopia showed the opposite trend. The prevalence of astigmatism and anisometropia was higher in the older age groups. No significant gender difference was found associated with the refractive status except for keratometric readings. Polar value analysis and the vector calculation method showed a trend toward against-the-rule astigmatism with increasing age in both refractive and keratometric astigmatism, with a discrepancy between the two.The overall prevalence of myopia (SE, <-0.5 diopters) was 41.8% in the study population, which is higher than that in population-based studies previously reported.",

        "abstract": "We demonstrated that a mass density and size effect are dominant factors to limit the transport properties of very thin amorphous Sn-doped InO (a-ITO) films. a-ITO films with various thicknesses (t) ranging from 5 to 50 nm were deposited on non-alkali glass substrates without intentional heating of the substrates by reactive plasma deposition with direct-current arc discharge. a-ITO films with t of more than 10 nm showed a high Hall mobility (μ) of more than 50 cm/V s. For 5-nm-thick a-ITO films, we found that μ was as high as more than 40 cm/V s. X-ray reflectivity measurement results revealed that the mass density (d) determined the carrier transport in a-ITO films. For a-ITO films with t of more than 10 nm, d had a high value of 7.2 g/cm, whereas a-ITO films with t of less than 10 nm had low d ranging from 6.6 to 6.8 g/cm. Quantitative new insight from a size effect on the carrier transport is given for a-ITO films with t of less than 10 nm. This study shows that the ratio of t to mean free path of carrier electrons governed μ.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) without upfront whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) has influenced recent treatment recommendations for brain metastasis patients. However, in brain metastasis patients who undergo SRS alone, new brain metastases inevitably appear with relatively high incidences during post-SRS follow-up. However, little is known about the second SRS results. The treatment results of second SRS were retrospectively reviewed, mainly for newly developed or, uncommonly, for recurrent brain metastases in order to reappraise the efficacy of this treatment strategy with a special focus on the maintenance of neurological status and safety. METHODS This was an institutional review board-approved, retrospective cohort study that used a prospectively accumulated database, including 3102 consecutive patients with brain metastases who underwent SRS between July 1998 and June 2015. Among these 3102 patients, 859 (376 female patients; median age 64 years; range 21-88 years) who underwent a second SRS without WBRT were studied with a focus on overall survival, neurological death, neurological deterioration, local recurrence, salvage SRS, and SRS-induced complications after the second SRS. Before the second SRS, the authors also investigated the clinical factors and radiosurgical parameters likely to influence these clinical outcomes. For the statistical analysis, the standard Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine post-second SRS survival and neurological death. A competing risk analysis was applied to estimate post-second SRS cumulative incidences of local recurrence, neurological deterioration, salvage SRS, and SRS-induced complications. RESULTS The post-second SRS median survival time was 7.4 months (95% CI 7.0-8.2 months). The actuarial survival rates were 58.2% and 34.7% at 6 and 12 months after the second SRS, respectively. Among 789 deceased patients, the causes of death could not be determined in 24 patients, but were confirmed in the remaining 765 patients to be nonbrain diseases in 654 (85.5%) patients and brain diseases in 111 (14.5%) patients. The actuarial neurological death-free survival rates were 94.4% and 86.6% at 6 and 12 months following the second SRS. Multivariable analysis revealed female sex, Karnofsky Performance Scale score of 80% or greater, better modified recursive partitioning analysis class, smaller tumor numbers, and higher peripheral dose to be significant predictive factors for longer survival. The cumulative incidences of local recurrence were 11.2% and 14.9% at 12 and 24 months after the second SRS. The crude incidence of neurological deterioration was 7.1%, and the respective cumulative incidences were 4.5%, 5.8%, 6.7%, 7.2%, and 7.5% at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months after the second SRS. SRS-induced complications occurred in 25 patients (2.9%) after a median post-second SRS period of 16.8 months (range 0.6-95.0 months; interquartile range 5.6-29.3 months). The cumulative incidences of complications were 1.4%, 2.0%, 2.4%, 3.0%, and 3.0% at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months after the second SRS, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Carefully selected patients with recurrent tumors-either new or locally recurrent-are favorable candidates for a second SRS, particularly in terms of neurological status maintenance and the safety of this treatment strategy.",

Recent experiments hint that the polymers form gel-like complexes with surfactants at the air–water interface and thus are immobilized in the foam film. We here treat the foam film as a polymer gel to analyze the stability and durability of the foam films. We take into account the van der Waals force and the surface tension in an extension of the theory of gel dynamics to predict the growth rate of the thermal fluctuations of the two surfaces in the foam film. Our theory predicts that the fluctuations are suppressed when the elastic constant of the polymer network is large, and the growth of the fluctuation is slowed by the friction between the solvent molecules and the polymer network.",

        "abstract": "Appropriate hemostasis is essential for clear visualization of the neural structures and cleavage planes. It is also essential for avoiding heat-induced injury, minimizing blood loss, and reducing operative time.To determine the role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in platelet-dependent hemostasis during neurosurgery.The amplification of aggregation, activation of integrin αIIbβ3, intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways, and activation of signaling cascades in platelets were evaluated. For comparison, various concentrations of a commercially available artificial CSF solution (aCSF), an artificial CSF solution prepared by the authors, and normal saline (NS) were used. Differences between aCSF and NS in obtaining in vivo hemostasis were assessed by measuring the tail vein bleeding time in C57BL/6N mice.Platelet aggregation was directly amplified by the addition of aCSF through increased activation of integrin αIIbβ3, phosphatidylserine exposure, and P-selectin expression. However, the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were not primarily related to coagulation activity with the addition of aCSF. Activation of Src kinase was related to platelet activation by aCSF. The elimination of sodium bicarbonate from aCSF and the addition of the selective inhibitor of the HCO3/Cl exchanger, 4,4u0027-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2u0027-disulfonic acid disodium salt, significantly inhibited platelet aggregation. The bleeding time in aCSF-treated mice was significantly shorter than that in NS-treated mice.Sodium bicarbonate facilitates hemostasis through the amplification of platelet aggregation function. The existence of CSF and irrigation with aCSF provide better conditions for physiological hemostasis and they have the potential of improving hemostasis by bipolar coagulation or with irrigation during neuroendoscopic procedures.",

The effects of drugs containing benzalkonium chloride (BAK) as well as those of the Rysmon TG vehicle alone were also assessed.At 1/30 dilution, cells treated with Timoptol and Timoptol XE showed cell deformation. Timoptol and Timoptol XE also caused a significant decrease in the number of cells at 1/100 and 1/30 dilutions. Cell activity decreased in a concentration-dependent manner after the addition of either Timoptol or Timoptol XE. Rysmon TG and Timabak showed significantly higher cell activity than Timoptol or Timoptol XE at both 1/100 and 1/30 dilutions. The cell count increased in a concentration-dependent manner in the BAK-free group, while cell activity decreased in a concentration-dependent manner in the cultures in the BAK-containing group.Compared with Timoptol and Timoptol XE, Rysmon TG and Timabak showed milder toxicity on human conjunctival cells in vitro.",

        "abstract": "Although the fluoroquinolones have strong antibacterial effects, some of them also have adverse ocular effects such as diplopia, uveitis, optic neuropathy, and retinal detachment. The purpose of this study was to determine whether low concentrations of fluoroquinolones can lessen the cytotoxic effects of ultraviolet (UV) light on different kinds of cultured ocular cells. We studied cultured human corneal endothelial cells (HCECs), a retinal ganglion cell line (RGC-5), a mouse-derived photoreceptor cell line (661W), a human adult retinal pigment epithelial cell line (ARPE-19), primary retinal cells, and primary human RPE cells. Levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and clinafloxacin were selected as the fluoroquinolones to test. The viabilities of the 661W, ARPE-19, and hRPE cells were assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8, and that of HCECs, 661W cells, and ARPE-19 cells by double fluorescent staining with Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide (PI). Damage of retinal primary culture cells was assessed by immunostaining. Intracellular production of reactive oxygen species was measured in ARPE-19 cells by CM-HDCFDA after UV light exposure. An activation of caspase by UV light in ARPE-19 cells was detected with a caspase-3/7 assay kit. UV exposure increased the number of dead cells, and the three fluoroquinolones tested suppressed this increase. Fluoroquinolones also protected the cells against the hydroxyperoxide (HO)-induced cell damage. Moreover, the fluoroquinolones decreased the production of reactive oxygen species and the activity of caspase-3/7, and low concentrations of fluoroquinolones reduced the oxidative stress in cultured ocular cell lines. We conclude that fluoroquinolones may have protective effects in these cells against UV exposure.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the association of sequence variations in the optineurin (OPTN) gene in patients with open-angle glaucoma.Prospective case control study.The OPTN gene was screened for sequence variations using a combination of single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and automated DNA sequencing. A total of 1,299 subjects (1048 glaucoma patients and 251 controls) were screened for variations in the four portions of the gene that had been previously associated with glaucoma. A subset of these subjects (376 patients and 176 controls) was screened for variations in the entire coding sequence. Twenty-four percent of the patients and 35% of the controls were Japanese, whereas the remainder were predominantly Caucasian. Allele frequencies were compared with the Fisher exact test.The OPTN sequence variations were not significantly associated with any form of high-tension open-angle glaucoma. One proband with familial normal-tension glaucoma was found to harbor the previously reported Glu50Lys variation. Another previously reported change, Met98Lys, was associated with normal-tension glaucoma in Japanese but not in Caucasian patients.This study provides some additional evidence for the association of the Glu50Lys OPTN sequence variation with familial normal tension glaucoma. However, because familial normal-tension glaucoma is so rare, this change seems to be responsible for less than 0.1% of all open-angle glaucoma. The Arg545Gln variation is likely to be a nondisease-causing polymorphism. The Met98Lys change may be associated with a fraction of normal-tension glaucoma in patients of Japanese ethnicity.",

However, detailed analysis of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) associated with concomitant TMZ has not been sufficiently described. We prospectively analyzed the profile of CINV associated with concomitant TMZ. Eighteen consecutive patients with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy including TMZ were enrolled. CINV was recorded using a daily diary including nausea assessment, emetic episodes, degree of appetite suppression, and antiemetic medication use. The observed incidence rates of all grade nausea, moderate/severe (CTC grade 2, 3) nausea, emetic episodes, and appetite suppression for the overall period were 89%, 39%, 39%, and 83%, respectively. Moderate/severe nausea and severe (CTC grade 3) appetite suppression were frequently observed during the delayed phase of the treatment. Emetic episodes and moderate/severe nausea were significantly correlated with female gender. Moderate/severe nausea and severe appetite suppression were significantly correlated with low lymphocyte counts before chemoradiotherapy. For CINV associated with concomitant TMZ, enhanced antiemetic therapy focused on the delayed phase of the treatment will likely be beneficial, especially in female patients with a low lymphocyte count before chemoradiotherapy.

        "abstract": "Abstract   The composite using thermosetting resin, such as epoxy resin, as matrix was difficult to be recycled. The mechanical properties of the composite materials were deeply involved with the surface adhesion between the raw materials. Our attention was paid to the interfacial properties between the materials in the composite. To enhance the mechanical properties of the thermoplastics reinforced by carbon fibers, the surface adhesion between them should be improved. First, polymer colloids including the same components as the thermoplastic resin were synthesized through the soap-free emulsion polymerization, or using thermoplastic powder and surfactant. These polymer particles were adsorbed on the carbon fibers by electrodeposition. The amount of the adsorbed particles on carbon fibers were controllable with the applied voltage. The surface adhesion between the modified carbon fiber and thermoplastic resin were evaluated to measure the interfacial shear strength thorough the fragmentation test. As a result, interfacial shear strength was enhanced as the amount of the adsorbed particles increased. Using the modified carbon fibers, carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic was prepared through hot press method with short reaction time. To investigate the mechanical properties of the carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic, the three-point bending tests were carried out. Because the surface adhesion between carbon fibers and thermoplastic resin, such as poly(methyl methacrylate) or nylon, was improved using the colloidal techniques, the mechanical properties of the carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic was also enhanced. Thus, the carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic with high performance was synthesized with the fundamental colloidal techniques. Carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic is expected to be used as the contractual and recyclable materials in the field of automobiles to realize the sustainable development.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods (NRs) were grown on ion-plated ZnO:Ga (GZO)/glass, sputtered Au/SiO 2 /Si(100) and commercial Au/Ti/Si(100) substrates by chemical bath deposition (CBD) using the aqueous solution of zinc nitrate hexahydrate [Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O] and hexamethylenetetramine (C 6 H 12 N 4 ) at the different growth times ( t  g ). Regardless of the difference in the substrate materials, ZnO NRs were highly oriented in the direction perpendicular to the substrate surface. Up to a  t  g  of 30 min, for all the NRs grown on the three different types of substrates, both the average width and length of the NRs increased rapidly with increasing  t  g . With further increasing  t  g , the average widths of the NRs grown on the GZO/glass, Au/SiO 2 /Si(100) and Au/Ti/Si(100) substrates tended to be saturated at the widths of ~200 nm, ~400 nm and ~1000 nm, respectively. The maximum average lengths grown on the GZO/glass, Au/SiO 2 /Si(100) and Au/Ti/Si(100) substrates were ~1100, ~1600 and ~2000 nm, respectively. The  t  g  dependence of the residual stress acting on the NRs grown on the GZO/glass exhibited a typical compressive-tensile-compressive evolution, which is characteristic to the films grown by the Volmer-Weber type growth mechanism. For the NRs grown on the Au/SiO 2 /Si(100) or Au/Ti/Si(100) substrates, however, the stresses acting on the NRs were tensile over the entire  t  g  range. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the NRs grown on the Au/Ti/Si(100) substrates were dominated by an orange band (OB) emission associated with oxygen interstitials over the entire  t  g  range. The NRs grown on the GZO/glass or Au/SiO 2 /Si(100) substrates at longer  t  g s exhibited a near-band-edge (NBE) emission at a wavelength of ~380 nm, and the PL intensity of the NBE emission relative to that of the OB emission became larger with increasing  t  g , indicating a decrease in surface state density with increasing  t  g . PL excitation spectra revealed that the OB emission is effectively excited by the generation of the excitons and/or the electron-hole pairs associated with the NBE emission. Photoacoustic spectra results yield that the selection of the substrate material or the precursor should be effective in the suppression of the formation of the deep-level defect associated with the in-gap photoacoustic band.",

An 89-year-old woman experienced epistaxis and suffered from hemorrhagic shock at her previous hospital. Head computed tomography(CT)images revealed a ruptured internal carotid aneurysm protruding into the Onodi cell, the most posterior ethmoidal sinus, which extends superolaterally to the sphenoid sinus. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a multilobular-shaped dissecting aneurysm with a maximal diameter of 6.7mm at the cavernous portion of the internal carotid artery(ICA). Overlapping stenting was performed to prevent recanalization. However, a fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage occurred 2 days after the procedure due to the progression of the dissection to the intracranial ICA. The anatomical characteristics of the ethmoidal sinus could be associated with the occurrence of epistaxis. A ruptured small ICA aneurysm with an Onodi cell might cause epistaxis without a history of trauma or infection.",

        "abstract": "To examine the correlation between the van Herick system and the Shaffer system in a large-scale epidemiological survey conducted on healthy Japanese subjects.The van Herick technique was performed on 14,779 subjects aged 40 years and over who participated in an ophthalmic epidemiological survey conducted in Tajimi City, Gifu Prefecture. Eyes classified as grade 1 or 2 according to the van Herick technique were diagnosed as narrow angle eyes, and those eyes were subjected to secondary examination using a gonioscope. In the secondary examination, glaucoma specialists evaluated angle width based on the Shaffer system.Nine hundred and twenty-three eyes of 505 subjects (108 men and 397 women) were determined to be narrow-angle eyes among the 14 779 subjects surveyed. There were 78 grade 1 eyes and 845 grade 2 eyes. Three hundred and eighty-three subjects (75.8%) underwent gonioscopic examination, and 426 eyes (65.9%) had an angle as narrow as or narrower than Shaffer grade 2. Among the 51 eyes evaluated as van Herick grade 1, 44 (86.3%) had an angle an narrow as or narrower than Shaffer grade 2, while among the 595 eyes evaluated as van Herick grade 2,382 (64.2%) had an angle as narrow as or narrower than Shaffer grade 2.The van Herick technique closely coincided with the Shaffer system and was found to have a potential for use as a simple method for evaluating narrow-angle eyes in Japanese.",

        "abstract": "Control of immune response requires the coordinated integration of both stimulatory and inhibitory factors. Therefore, the cross-talk of different signaling pathways is critical in providing an integrated cellular response to multiple external signals. Both interleukin-4 (IL-4) and transforming growth factor (TGF-β) are pleiotropic cytokines and play critical roles in controlling immune responses. For example, IL-4 mediates important pro-inflammatory functions in asthma including induction of the IgE isotype switch and expression of vascular cell adhesion molecules. Whereas, TGF-β is secreted from B, T, and dendritic cells as well as macrophages, and negatively regulates their proliferation, differentiation, and activation by other cytokines. In this study, we examined the effect of TGF-β on IL-4 signaling using B cells as well as embryonic kidney cells. TGF-β inhibited IL-4-induced IgG1 production and gene expression of germline ε transcripts in B cells. In embryonic kidney cells, TGF-β signals suppressed IL-4-induced transcription, when we monitored using germline ε promoter DNA. Furthermore, activation of NF-κB resulted in a resistance to TGF-β-mediated suppression of IL-4 signaling. These results indicate that TGF-β-mediated regulation of IL-4 signaling may act by targeting NF-κB signaling.",

        "abstract": "There is preliminary evidence suggesting that hippocampal functioning is associated with attachment style. However, it is unknown if attachment is also associated with hippocampal-related cognitive function such as spatial learning and recall. This study aims to verify if attachment dimensions are associated with spatial learning and recall. Sixty-five female participants were recruited and were evaluated using the Adult Attachment Scale-R and tested on a virtual maze navigation task (VMT) at one moment (exploratory trial + 3 trials) and 24 h later (3 trials). There was a significant Moment × Trial × Close-Depend interaction for the outcome time, (2,126) = 3.807,  = 0.025, with  analysis indicating that the High Close-Depend group displayed significant improvements between Trial 1 and Trial 3 in the post-test assessment. Conversely, the Low Close-Depend group displayed significant improvements between Trial 1and Trial 3 but on the pre-test assessment. Furthermore, the Low Close-Depend group presented significant better performance in pre-test Trial 3 in comparison to the High Close-Depend group. Thereby, it seems that low comfort with proximity and trust in others is associated with reduced spatial recall, although spatial learning performance was actually superior in these participants. It is possible that reduced exposure to social interaction and meaningful relationships may be reduced in the Low Close-Depend group, leading to modifications in hippocampal function and, ultimately, reduced spatial recall. Oppositely, participants in the High Close-Depend group may not display typical spatial learning in the proposed task as they are more willing to freely explore the presented environment.",

In the MDC–SHG measurement, gradual increase of the orientational order parameters C 01 ≡ 〈 cos ⁡ θ 〉 and C 03 ≡ 〈 5 cos ⁡ 3 θ − 3 cos ⁡ θ 〉 / 2 ( θ : tilt angle, 〈 〉 : thermodynamic average) was detected as the molecular area was decreased. In order to clarify this result, a model of monolayers comprised of banana-shaped achiral molecules was constructed taking into account the electrostatic Coulomb interaction between constituent molecules and induced image dipole at an air–water interface, and the entropy with respect to positional and orienational distribution of constituent molecules. A good agreement between the model calculation and the experimental result demonstrated that the geometrical constraint imposed on the orientation of constituent molecules at an air–water interface (interfacial binding effect) plays an important role in the determination of orientational structure of monolayers comprised of banana-shaped achiral molecules.",

        "abstract": "The molecular subgrouping of diffuse gliomas was recently found to stratify patients into prognostically distinct groups better than histological classification. Among several molecular parameters, the key molecules for the subtype diagnosis of diffuse gliomas are IDH mutation, 1p/19q co-deletion, and ATRX mutation; 1p/19q co-deletion is undetectable by immunohistochemistry, but is mutually exclusive with ATRX and p53 mutation in IDH mutant gliomas. Therefore, we applied ATRX and p53 immunohistochemistry instead of 1p/19q co-deletion analysis. The prognostic value of immunohistochemical diagnosis for Grade III gliomas was subsequently investigated. Then, the same immunohistochmical diagnostic approach was expanded for the evaluation of Grade II and IV diffuse glioma prognosis. The results indicate immunohistochemical analysis including IDH1/2, ATRX, p53, and Ki-67 index is valuable for the classification of diffuse gliomas, which is useful for the evaluation of prognosis, especially Grade III gliomas and lower-grade gliomas (i.e., Grade II and III).",

        "abstract": "Crosslinking of multivalent antigen bound IgE transduces FcepsilonRI mediated signaling cascades, which activate nonreceptor-type protein-tyrosine kinases and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, and these are critical elements for degranulation in mast cells. We cloned a novel adaptor molecule, signal transducing adaptor protein (STAP)-2 containing PH and SH2-like domains as a c-fms interacting protein. STAP-2 was identical to a recently cloned adaptor molecule, BKS, a substrate of BRK (breast tumor kinase) tyrosine kinase, although its function is still unknown. To examine a novel function of STAP-2/BSK, we expressed STAP-2/BSK or its mutants in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells. Overexpression of STAP-2/BSK resulted in a suppression of FcepsilonRI-mediated calcium mobilization and degranulation. FcepsilonRI-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma) but not Syk was significantly suppressed in these cells. Furthermore, STAP-2/BSK associated with PLC-gamma in vivo. These data indicate that STAP-2/BSK negatively controls the FcepsilonRI-mediated calcium mobilization and degranulation by direct modulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma.",

The IOP measurements were made with a Goldmann applanation tonometer (GAT) at the baseline, and at 1, 3, 4, and 6 months after the treatment. The IOP at the untreated baseline and at the end of each treatment period was measured at 10:00, 12:00, and 16:00 hours. The central corneal thickness (CCT) was measured at each visit using an ultrasonic pachymeter.The mean baseline IOP was 13.9 ± 2.5 mmHg, and the CCT was 536.7 ± 30.5 μm. Latanoprost reduced the IOP by 2.5 ± 1.7 mmHg and travoprost by 2.6 ± 1.5 mmHg from the baseline (p = 0.6807). The CCT decreased significantly to 531.9 ± 30.3 at 3 months (p = 0.0160) and to 529.4 ± 30.5 μm at 6 months (p = 0.0002) after the therapy. The decrease was significantly greater in eyes after travoprost (p = 0.0049).Travoprost has similar effect as latanoprost in reducing the IOP in glaucoma patients with relatively low IOPs. The use of prostaglandin analogs can decrease the CCT, and this change should be considered when the IOPs obtained by GAT are analyzed.",

        "abstract": "Background  Hemifacial spasm (HFS) caused by a contralateral tumor is extremely rare, and all previously reported cases involved tumors at the cerebellopontine angle. We provide the first report to our knowledge of HFS caused by a contralateral foramen magnum meningioma, which improved after tumor removal without microvascular decompression.    Case Description  An 80-year-old woman presented with HFS caused by a contralateral foramen magnum meningioma. She had a 3-year history of gradual worsening of right-sided HFS. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a homogeneous gadolinium-enhancing tumor occupying the left ventrolateral portion of the foramen magnum. The loop of the right anterior inferior cerebellar artery extended into the right pontomedullary junction, compressing the root exit zone (REZ) of the right facial nerve. After tumor removal, with no attempt of confirmation of vascular compression of the right facial nerve REZ, facial spasm gradually decreased and eventually almost disappeared. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the loop of anterior inferior cerebellar artery had shifted away from the right facial nerve REZ. Dorsal shift of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery loop toward the facial nerve REZ along with dorsal shift of the vertebral and basilar arteries secondary to the huge contralateral mass located in the ventrolateral portion of the foramen magnum was suggested to represent the main cause of facial spasm.    Conclusions  Although an extremely rare condition, facial spasm can develop as a result of contralateral tumors in locations other than the cerebellopontine angle.",

We derive the condition of the chiral phase separation in an analogous form to the Bragg–Williams theory, and predict that chiral phase separation occurs as the spontaneous polarization in monolayer normal increases in agreement with our experimental results.

A new theoretical equation to calculate fundamental uncertainty region in the case that the maximum and minimum particle sizes are known, is derived based on Tschebyscheff theory. The uncertainty regions calculated based on the proposed method are applied to poly-disperse particles and a picket-fence distribution composed of two kinds of nearly mono-disperse particles. For the poly-disperse particles, the uncertainty region increases with the increase in particle diameter. For the picket-fence distribution composed of two kinds of nearly mono-disperse particles, the uncertainty region increases around the intermediate particle diameters between the two kinds of particles. Numerical simulation of uncertainty region for the picket-fence distribution has also been carried out. The uncertainty region decreases with the increase in sample size or the decrease in geometric standard deviation.",

For RF-magnetron-sputtered AZO films, the results of the electron probe microanalyzer and photo luminescence measurements show that the effects of the erosion zone of the targets on the properties were very small at any given substrate position, resulting in small differences in the structural and electrical properties among the AZO films grown at different substrate ...",

        "abstract": "Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) spatial multiplexing is known to increase the transmission rate without bandwidth expansion. However, in cellular networks (CNs), the transmission rate of a user close to the cell edge significantly degrades because the received signal-to-interference plus noise power ratio (SINR) degrades due to the presence of strong co-channel interference (CCI) from neighboring cells. Distributed antenna network (DAN), in which many antennas are spatially distributed over the cell, is suitable for MIMO spatial multiplexing because the received SINR improves over the entire cell. In this paper, assuming block transmission with cyclic prefix (CP) insertion, we theoretically derive an expression for the downlink spectral efficiency of DAN-MIMO spatial multiplexing in a multi-cell environment. Then, we propose the optimal and suboptimal transmit power allocation schemes for DAN-MIMO spatial multiplexing. We evaluate the spectral efficiency distribution by Monte Carlo numerical computation method to show that DAN allows single frequency reuse and achieves higher spectral efficiency compared to CN.",

Furthermore, immune checkpoint pathway-targeted therapies including anti- programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) antibody have been remarkably effective in other neoplasms, and various clinical trials with anti-PD-1 antibody in patients with HGG have started to date. It is possible that up-regulation of immune checkpoint molecules in tumor tissues after vaccine therapy may be one of the mechanisms of vaccine failure. Multiple preclinical studies indicate that combination therapy with vaccination and immune checkpoint blockade is effective for the treatment of malignant tumors including HGG. Thus, immunotherapy, especially combination therapy with vaccine and immune checkpoint inhibitors, may be a promising strategy for treatment of patients with HGG.",

However, in order to achieve the sufficiently improved performance, the use of a fairly large number M of surviving paths in the M-algorithm is required because if smaller M is used, the probability of removing the correct path at early stages increases. In this paper, to reduce this probability, we proposed a training sequence-aided QRM-MLD block signal detection for SC MIMO spatial multiplexing. We show by computer simulation that training sequence-aided SC (TA-SC) MIMO spatial multiplexing using QRM-MLD block signal detection with M=16 can achieve the PER performance similar to CP-SC MIMO spatial multiplexing with M=1024 in the case of 16QAM and 4×4 MIMO spatial multiplexing.",

        "abstract": "Concomitant use of temozolomide (TMZ) and radiotherapy, which is the standard therapy for patients with high-grade glioma, involves a unique regimen with multiple-day, long-term administration. In a previous study, we showed not only higher incidence rates of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) during the overall study period, but also substantially higher incidence rates of moderate/severe nausea and particularly severe appetite suppression during the late phase of the treatment. Here, we prospectively evaluated the efficacy of a combination of palonosetron, aprepitant, and dexamethasone for CINV in patients treated with concomitant TMZ and radiotherapy. Twenty-one consecutive patients with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma were enrolled. CINV was recorded using a daily diary and included nausea assessment, emetic episodes, degree of appetite suppression, and use of antiemetic medication. The percentage of patients with a complete response in the overall period was 76.2%. The percentages of patients with no moderate/severe nausea were 90.5, 100, and 90.5% in the early phase, late phase, and overall period, respectively. Severe appetite suppression throughout the overall period completely disappeared. The combination of palonosetron, aprepitant, and dexamethasone was highly effective and well tolerated in patients treated with concomitant TMZ and radiotherapy. This combination of antiemetic therapy focused on delayed as well as acute CINV and may have the potential to overcome CINV associated with a multiple-day, long-term chemotherapy regimen.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Due to the strong correlation with material properties, fiber length distribution in polymer composites has been extensively investigated. The distribution exhibits steep increase until a peak followed by a long tail decay, which has been analyzed in terms of Weibull distribution. However, interpretation of the stochastic process behind Weibull distribution is not trivial, particularly for the shape parameter. In this study, a simple distribution function is proposed based on the two Poisson processes at the breakage of loaded fibers; one of them is a series of memoryless events for the fiber breakage with a characteristic length  λ   a  , and the other one is another series of memoryless events blocking the adjacent breaks with an interval length of  λ   b  . The proposed function was examined against literature data for nylon-6 composites containing glass fibers and carbon fibers. For the glass fiber composites for which the processing conditions were varied at the same fiber content, the proposed function captures the experimental data as well as the Weibull distribution. The obtained  λ   a   shows a good correlation with the mechanical properties of the composites to hint the relation to the processing conditions. For the carbon fiber composites for which the fiber content was varied, the proposed distribution better captures the long tail decay than the Weibull distribution whereas the Weibull distribution better captures the data around the sharp peak for high fiber contents than the proposed distribution. It so appears that the proposed function provides a straightforward analysis of the fiber length distribution in polymer composites, in particular for the long tail decay that is of importance for the material properties.",

        "abstract": "Although promising preliminary results have been widely observed with bevacizumab for recurrent malignant gliomas, many unanswered questions remain to be resolved to achieve an optimal outcome. No predictive biomarkers of a survival benefit from bevacizumab have been established, and no consensus exists about the response or survival benefit regarding the prior recurrence pattern or tumor location. Here we retrospectively analyzed the clinical benefit from bevacizumab for recurrent malignant gliomas in relation to the prior recurrence pattern or tumor location. Thirty-one consecutive patients with recurrent malignant gliomas who were treated with bevacizumab were investigated. The treatment response and survival benefit from bevacizumab were analyzed in association with age, sex, Karnofsky performance status, prior pathological diagnosis, prior recurrence pattern, primary location of tumor, recurrence status, and expression of angiogenic and hypoxic markers. The group with leptomeningeal dissemination had a significantly shorter median overall survival with bevacizumab (OS (6.0months, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-10.7) compared to those in the local/distant group (11.8months, 95% CI 6.1-17.4). The median OS of the infratentorial tumor group and supratentorial tumor group were 9.2months (95% CI 5.0-13.4) and 10.4months (95% CI 6.6-14.3), respectively. With multivariate analysis, the prior recurrence pattern was the only independent prognostic factor of OS. Patients with leptomeningeal dissemination of recurrent malignant glioma experienced minimal benefit from bevacizumab. Therefore, in the context of cost effectiveness, bevacizumab is not recommended for patients with leptomeningeal dissemination.",

The amount of PMMA particles adsorbed on the modified carbon fibers was varied using the electrophoresis technique performed in polymer colloids for a short time. Additionally, the interfacial shear strength between the modified carbon fiber and the resin was controlled by a modification of the present process. An improved interaction and a strengthened surface adhesion between the carbon fiber coated with particles and the PMMA resin were observed.",

        "abstract": "Tumor angiogenesis has attracted increasing attention because of its potential as a valuable marker in the differential diagnosis of brain tumors as well as a novel therapeutic target. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is expressed by the neovasculature endothelium of some tumors, with little to no expression by the tumor cells or normal vasculature endothelium. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of PSMA for the evaluation of the tumor neovasculature of various brain tumors and the possibility of detecting PSMA expression in brain tumors using PET imaging with Zr-Df-IAB2M (anti-PSMA minibody). Eighty-three tissue specimens including gliomas, metastatic brain tumors, primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL), or radiation necroses were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining with PSMA antibody. Zr-Df-IAB2M PET scans were performed in three patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas or metastatic brain tumor. PSMA was highly expressed in the vascular endothelium of high-grade glioma and metastatic brain tumor, whereas PSMA was poorly expressed in the vascular endothelium of PCNSL and radiation necrosis. PSMA expression in high-grade gliomas and a metastatic brain tumor was clearly visualized by PET imaging with Zr-Df-IAB2M. Furthermore, a trend toward a positive correlation between the degree of Zr-Df-IAB2M uptake and PSMA expression levels in tumor specimens was observed. PET imaging of PSMA using Zr-Df-IAB2M may have potential value in the differential diagnosis of high-grade glioma from PCNSL or radiation necrosis as well as in the prediction of treatment efficacy and assessment of treatment response to bevacizumab therapy for high-grade glioma.",

        "abstract": "The performance of a novel cyclone separator with a cone made of porous sintered metal was compared with that of a conventional design with a cone made of acrylic resin. Controlled injection of clean air through the porous cone is proposed as a new method to control the cut size and reduce powder deposition on the cone. In the experiments, when clean air was not injected through the porous cone, the cut size and the amount of powder deposited on the porous cone were greater than for the acrylic resin cone. However, the introduction of adequate clean air through the porous cone simultaneously reduced the cut size and the powder deposition to less than those with the conventional cone. The revised horizontal-flow model revealed that this occurred because the injected clean air enhanced the tangential velocity of the fluid near the cone surface by reducing the surface’s apparent friction factor. It was also confirmed that the clean air ratio can be used to control the cut size while keeping the separation accuracy constant. Further, the novel model could also estimate the dependence of the 50% cut size on the clean-air ratio.",

The force curves between silica particles and a mica surface were measured in water, and AFM was used to examine the surfaces of the particles. AFM was performed in contact mode with a colloid probe and was used to measure the interaction forces between silica particles and a mica surface in water and to investigate the influence of friction between the silica particles and the glass beads on the zeta potential of the silica particles. The zeta potential was enhanced by an increasing number of friction cycles. Friction between the tested silica particles and the glass beads during bead milling contributed to the enhanced zeta potential of the tested silica particles. AFM performed in imaging mode was employed to investigate the influence of friction between the tested silica particles and the glass beads on particle surface morphology. The surface roughness of both the tested silica particles and the glass beads was decreased slightly by friction. It is possible that friction between particles by the loading force of 10 nN slightly abrades the particle surface, thereby removing contaminations and impurities from the surface, increasing the hydrophilicity enhancing the surface potential.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the safety and efficacy of postoperative proton beam therapy (PBT) combined with nimustine hydrochloride (ACNU) or temozolomide (TMZ) for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The subjects were 46 patients with GBM who were treated with high dose (96.6 GyE) PBT. There were 24 males and 22 females, and the median age was 58 years old (range 24-76). The Karnofsky performance status was 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 in 5, 10, 12, 11 and 8 patients, respectively. Total resection, partial resection, and biopsy were performed for 31, 14 and 1 patients, respectively. Photon beams were delivered to high intensity areas on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the morning (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions). More than 6 h later, PBT was delivered to the enhanced area plus a 10 mm margin in the first half of the protocol (23.1 GyE in 14 fractions) and to the enhanced volume in the second half (23.1 GyE in 14 fraction). Concurrent chemotherapy with ACNU during weeks 1 and 4 or daily TMZ was administered in 23 and 23 patients, respectively. The overall 1 and 2 year survival rates were 82.6 and 47.6 %, respectively. Median survival was 21.1 months (95 % CI 13.1-29.2), with no significant difference in survival between the ACNU and TMZ groups. The patient characteristics were similar in the two groups. Late radiation necrosis occurred in 11 patients (six ACNU, five TMZ), but was controlled by necrotomy and therapy including bevacizumab. PBT concurrent with ACNU or TMZ was tolerable and beneficial for carefully selected patients with GBM.",

The cup-to-disk area ratio and the visual field mean deviation were matched in both groups. The prevalence of peripapillary atrophy and peripapillary atrophy-to-disk area ratio of eyes with primary angle-closure glaucoma and eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma were compared. The correlation between the peripapillary atrophy area and the cup-to-disk area ratio or the mean deviation was also evaluated.Eight (38%) of 21 eyes with primary angle-closure glaucoma and 21 (68%) of 31 eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma had peripapillary atrophy. The peripapillary atrophy-to-disk area ratio averaged 0.16 in primary angle-closure glaucoma and 0.41 in primary open-angle glaucoma. There were statistically significant differences regarding the prevalence of peripapillary atrophy (P = .048) and peripapillary atrophy-to-disk area ratio (P = .005) between the two groups. There was no significant correlation between the peripapillary atrophy area and the cup-to-disk area ratio or the mean deviation in primary angle-closure glaucoma. In contrast, the peripapillary atrophy-to-disk area ratio significantly correlated with the cup-to-disk area ratio (P = .003) and the mean deviation (P = .0001) in primary open-angle glaucoma.The peripapillary atrophy in primary angle-closure glaucoma has a different relationship to the structural and functional optic disk changes than that in primary open-angle glaucoma. Different mechanisms seem to be involved in the development of the optic disk damage in the two types of glaucoma.",

        "abstract": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) plays central roles in embryonic development, organogenesis, and physiologic connective tissue remodeling during wound healing and tissue repair as well as in carcinogenesis. Estrogens have key roles in a variety of biological events, such as the development and maintenance of female reproductive organs and bone and lipid metabolism. Previous studies demonstrated that estrogens suppress TGF-beta-induced gene expression, such as type IV collagen in kidney mesangial cells. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate this antagonistic effect are unknown. To elucidate the mechanisms of cross-talk between TGF-beta and estrogen receptor (ER) signaling pathways, we reconstituted TGF-beta and ER signaling in human kidney carcinoma cells. Here we demonstrate that TGF-beta-induced activation of Sma and MAD-related protein 3 (Smad3) activity, one of the major intracellular transducers of TGF-beta signaling, was suppressed by ER, whereas ER-mediated transcriptional activation was enhanced by TGF-beta signaling. We provide evidence that this two-way cross-talk between the estrogen and TGF-beta signaling pathways was the result of direct physical interactions between Smad3 and ER. These findings have implications for a variety of disease states, such as the pathophysiology of kidney function, atherosclerosis, and breast cancer.",

Of the 1,039 visual field data, 698 (modeling data) were used for determining the sector pattern and 341 (testing data) for checking the sector pattern. The modeling data were further divided into three groups according to the mean deviation (MD) (MD > or = -10 dB, -20 < or = MD < -10 dB, and MD < -20 dB), and the sector pattern was constructed from visual field data of each group using a clustering procedure called VARCLUS. The testing data were used for determining the optimal sector pattern. In a separate set of repeated visual field data of 303 patients with OAG, the fluctuation of MD, sector values of each sector determined, and total deviation of each test point were calculated and compared.The sector pattern constructed from visual field data of MD > or = -10 dB summarized the visual field performance most effectively. The fluctuation of the sector value of each sector was roughly 1.5 times smaller than the total deviation of each test point.The sector pattern determined may be useful in analyses of the visual field data of patients with glaucoma.",

        "title": "OS09.8 Randomized placebo-controlled trial of autologous formalin-fixed tumor vaccine for newly diagnosed glioblastoma",
        "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: There is a growing interest in development of novel therapeutic modalities based on tumor-specific immune reactions for management of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Autologous formalin-fixed tumor vaccine (AFTV) was designed by our group for in vivo induction of killer lymphocytes and activation of T-lymphocyte (Nat Med 1995, 1996). In first trial for recurrent GBM, 3 responding patients survived more than 20 months after AFTV administration (Cancer Sci, 2007). Efficacy of AFTV concomitant with fractionated radiotherapy (FRT) without chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with newly-diagnosed GBM was evaluated in prospective phase I/IIa trial (C00002), which showed median overall survival (OS) of 19.8 months (J Neurosurg, 2011). Another prospective multicenter phase I/IIa trial (UMIN01426) for evaluation of the combined use of AFTV and standard chemoradiotherapy with TMZ (AFTV+RT/TMZ: (Stupp regimen) for newly-diagnosed GBM, showing median progression-free survival (PFS) and OS of 8.2 and 22.2 months, respectively (J Neurosurg, 2013). Currently, prospective multicenter placebo-controlled double-blind phase IIb/III trial (UMIN10602) directing on evaluation of AFTV+RT/TMZ for newly-diagnosed GBM is ongoing and recruiting of patients for its phase IIb part has been finished in January 2016. We here report preliminary results before a key opening. METHODS: The phase IIb/III study investigated the AFTV plus chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide (AFTV + RT/TMZ; Stupp protocol) versus placebo plus chemoradio- therapy (Pla + RT/TMZ) for newly diagnosed glioblastoma. After resection surgery, patients with glioblastoma were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive AFTV (2 courses; 3 times, once a week) + RT/TMZ or Pla + RT/TMZ until disease progression. The primary end point was overall survival (OS), and secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate, QOL, and safety. RESULTS: Adult 63 patients with supratentrial glioblastoma were enrolled, although 3 patients withdraw the consents. Among 60 patients for full analysis set, baseline characteristics were balanced. The median age was 61 years old, men vs. women were 33 vs. 27, and the median resection rate was 95%. Mean follow-up period was 15.8 months. The median PFS was 14.2 months and 6-month PFS was 75% both for AFTV+RT/TMZ and Pla+RT/TMZ. The median PFS was 21.4 months and 1-year survival was 86% both for AFTV+RT/TMZ and Pla+RT/TMZ. No severe adverse events caused by AFTV or placebo were observed. CONCLUSION: The phase IIb part of the trial has been done safely and trial would be promising because the median PFS for both groups was more than a year. If AFTV+RT/TMZ would show longer survival time compared to Pla+RT/TMZ by the key open, a phase III would be warranted.",

        "abstract": "The shear-induced domain deformation in a lipid monolayer comprised of tilted molecules is studied as a mechanical balance between surface pressure, line tension, electrostatic energy due to the dipole-dipole interaction, hexatic-elastic stress, and viscous stress. It is found that a simple shear can deform a circular domain into an elliptic shape with the long axis inclined 45 degrees from the shear direction. The \"ellipse\" is elongated in the long axis as shear rate increases, and evolves to a straight or kinked stripe, which was observed as a \"shear band\" by Fuller's group [Science 274, 233 (1996)] and \"avalanche-like fronts\" by Schwaltz's group [Langmuir 17, 3017 (2001)], at a threshold shear rate. The propagation of stripe-shaped domains is discussed in the context of electrostatic energy. The dependence of the threshold shear rate on surface pressure is predicted in good agreement with observation and can be used to estimate surface viscosity. The shear-induced domain deformation is maintained by the effect of the lattice elastic stress when shear ceases.",

        "abstract": "Smads proteins play a key role in the intracellular signaling of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta family of growth factors, which exhibits a diverse set of cellular responses, including cell proliferation and differentiation. In particular, Smad7 acts as an antagonist of TGF-beta signaling, which could determine the intensity or duration of its signaling cascade. In this study we identified a protein inhibitor of activated STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription), PIASy, as a novel interaction partner of Smad7 by yeast two-hybrid screening using the MH2 domain of Smad7 as bait. The association of Smad7 and PIASy was confirmed using co-expressed tagged proteins in 293T cells. Moreover, we found that other Smads including Smad3 also associated with PIASy through its MH2 domain, and PIASy suppressed TGF-beta-mediated activation of Smad3. PIASy also stimulated the sumoylation of Smad3 in vivo. Furthermore, endogenous PIASy expression was induced by TGF-beta in Hep3B cells. These findings provide the first evidence that a PIAS family protein, PIASy, associates with Smads and involves the regulation of TGF-beta signaling using the negative feedback loop.",

        "abstract": "In the fifth-generation mobile communications system (5G), wireless connections among numerous Internet of things (IoT) devices will be accommodated in the massive machine-type communications (mMTC) scenario. To realize such massive connectivity, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technologies have been proposed for 5G. As one of the NOMA schemes, we have proposed a grant-free sparse chaos code multiple access (GF-SCCMA) scheme exploiting the principle of chaos communications for mMTC. It realizes both physical layer security and large-capacity transmission. However, in conventional studies, a message-passing algorithm (MPA) was used in the receiver, which required relatively high calculation complexity, and the maximum number of users in GF-SCCMA was limited to approximately 10. Therefore, we propose an application of the Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) algorithm for user signal detection to realize a large-scale transmission of more than 50 users with low calculation complexity. The improved transmission performances are shown through numerical simulations, by comparison with a conventional grant-free low-density signature scheme.",

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) also has pleiotropy including the production of acute phase proteins in hepatocytes. To elucidate the cross-talk between IL-6 and TGF-beta signaling pathways in hepatic cells, we investigated the effects of TGF-beta on IL-6-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) activation in a human hepatoma cell line, Hep3B. IL-6-induced activation of STAT3 activity and STAT3-mediated gene expression were augmented by TGF-beta in Hep3B cells. We provide evidence that these activities were due to physical interactions between STAT3 and Sma- and MAD-related protein-3, bridged by p300. These results demonstrate a molecular mechanism of a cross-talk between STAT3 and TGF-beta signaling pathways in hepatocytes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Zinc oxide (ZnO) films were grown on glass substrates with ion-platedGa-doped ZnO (GZO) buffer layers at various substrate temperatures by atmospheric-pressure chemical vapor deposition using Zn powder and water as precursors. All the X-ray diffraction patterns of the ZnO/GZO films were dominated by a ZnO(002) peak, indicating the successful growth of highly  c -axis oriented films. The substrate temperature dependence of growth rate was divided into three regions with the different activation energies,  i.e. re-evaporation, mass-transport controlled and surface-controlled regions. Scanning-electron-microscope observations revealed that the films grown at the substrate temperature in the mass-transport-controlled region exhibited the terrace-like surface morphology with rock-like structures. Photoluminescence spectra of the ZnO/GZO films were composed of a near-band-edge (NBE) emission at a wavelength of about 380 nm and a broad-band emission spreading over the visible wavelength region, as regardless of the substrate temperature. The visible-broad-band emissions observed on many samples could be decomposed into two or three peak emissions with the Lorentzian shapes. With increasing substrate temperature, the wavelength of the emission showing the strongest intensity, which was obtained by the decomposition of the visible-broad-band emission, shifted towards longer wavelengths together with the broadening of its width.",

In TD-QRM-MLBD, the cyclic prefix (CP) is inserted in order to avoid inter-block interference (IBI). However, the CP insertion reduces the transmission efficiency. In this paper, we propose an iterative overlap TD-QRM-MLBD which requires no CP insertion. We evaluate the throughput performance of iterative overlap TD-QRM-MLBD by computer simulation to compare it with the conventional TD-QRM-MLBD with CP insertion.",

Androgens are important in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer and their effects are mediated by androgen receptor (AR). Here we present a molecular mechanism for the effects of IL-6 on prostate cancer cells through a cross-talk between IL-6 and AR signaling pathways. IL-6-induced activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was augmented by AR in the presence of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). In addition, DHT treatment augmented endogenous STAT3-mediated gene expression by IL-6. Conversely, DHT-induced AR activity was increased by IL-6, and a dominant negative form of STAT3 inhibited AR activation. In contrast, DHT-mediated enhancement of STAT3 activation was inhibited by flutamide, an AR antagonist. We provide evidence that these activities are due to direct physical interactions between STAT3 and AR in prostate cancer cells.",

        "abstract": "Experimental studies have been carried out about the separation performance of a special electrical hydrocyclone. In this study, effect of inlet flow rate, applied electrostatic potential, pH, and beads mill operating condition on separation performance of a special electrical hydrocyclone were investigated. A 0.5 wt% suspension of sub-micron silica dispersed by the beads mill was used as the test powder. A 20 mm electrical hydrocyclone in diameter with 20% of underflow was examined. A negative center electrode was vertically inserted inside the conical section and the potential difference up to 100 V was applied between the conical wall and the center electrode in the hydrocyclone. By use of beads mill, it was found that the negative values of zeta potential increases with the increase of the particles diameter. It was found that the separation performance of the electrical hydrocyclone increases significantly with the decrease of inlet flow rate and increase of the electrostatic potential, while the separation performance shows a less significant increase as the pH of suspension increases. Under several times of milling by use of the same beads, the values of zeta potential were not constant. The negative zeta potential of suspension attains the highest value under six times of milling by use of the same beads. A new model, based on the diffusive mass transfer equation in the conical section of the electrical hydrocyclone has been developed, and compared to the experimental results. It is found that the calculated results by the new model shows a qualitative agreement with the experimental results.

Currently the recent interest about hydrocyclone separator is to separate the particles in the sub-micron region with a fairly high degree of classification, since the particles with such size range (0.1–1 μm) are required for various powder handling processes. Iinoya et al. [3] found that it was possible to classify powders of sub-micron size range by use of a special gas cyclone. Many improvements of the gas cyclone configuration have been continuously developed to obtain the smaller cut size. Several methods of flow controlling method at the outlet pipe of the hydrocyclone were reported [4,5] , and some new methods of controlling the cut size of the hydrocyclone by modifying the inlet section have been developed [6,7] . Estimations for 50% cut size for hydrocyclones have been obtained via various approaches [8–11] . The use of additional applied potential by considering the electrophoretic properties of the particles in order to enhance the separation performance of gas cyclones without increasing their pressure drop has been examined, and the effect of various operating conditions and dimensions on the separation performance of electrically enhanced gas cyclones have been reported [12–14] . Several models predicting the separation performance of electrically enhanced gas cyclone have been built [15,16] . Compared to that of the electrical gas cyclones, fewer studies have been carried out about the effect of applied external electrostatic potential on the separation performance in the hydrocyclone. Since the dimensions of most hydrocyclones are smaller compared to gas cyclones, and the dielectric constants of liquids are much larger compared to those of gases, smaller applied electrostatic potential, which leads to less energy consumption, can be applied in order to obtain the classification of fine particles. The first work about electrical hydrocyclones has been reported by Yoshida et al. [17] . A semi-empirical correlation based on the experimental data predicting the 50% cut size of a special electrical hydrocyclone has been developed by Pratarn et al. [18] . In this work, our goal is to optimize the hydrocyclone and decrease the cut size until it reaches the sub-micron region. The minimum cut size achieved by use of the typical laboratory scale hydrocyclone is about 5 μm under normal operating conditions and 3 μm under high pressure conditions. By use of t he multiple inlets, the cut size could be reduced until about 2 μm [19] . However, the typical hydrocyclone which depends only on the tangential force is unable to separate the sub-micron particles. In order to separate the sub-micron particles, the additional force should be applied in the apparatus. Our previous study indicates that by use of a special electrical hydrocyclone under low flow rates, the achieved cut size was about 0.4 μm [20] . This paper describes the effect of suspension flow rate, applied electrostatic potential, pH and the beads mill operating conditions on the separation performance of the sub-micron particles by the special electrical hydrocyclone. A new model based on the diffusive mass transfer mechanism in the conical section is proposed in order to estimate the separation performance of the special electrical hydrocyclone. 2 Experimental methods The experimental apparatus of the electrical hydrocyclone is shown in Fig. 1 . The system in general, consists of a hydrocyclone with a 20% underflow ratio and a suspension mixing tank. Well-dispersed 0.5 wt% of silica suspension was pumped into the hydrocyclone with low flow rates, since only the effect of the electrostatic force on the separation performance of the special electrical hydrocyclone, not the inertial force, was considered as the main driving force of separation in the hydrocyclone. A 0.1 M NaOH solution was used to control the pH of the suspension. The temperature of the feed suspension was controlled to 30 °C, and the discharged flows of both overflow and underflow were returned to the slurry tank. The experiments were carried out within 20 min in order to maintain steady conditions. The samples of both fine and coarse suspensions were collected, and the mass of each sample was measured. The Dynamic Light Scattering method (HORIBA Co. Ltd., LB-550) was used as the particle size distribution analyzer, and the zeta potential of the suspension was measured by a zeta size measuring device (Zetasizer 2000 by Malvern Instrument Co. Ltd.). The partial separation efficiency, Δ η , was calculated by: (1) Δ η = m c f c Δ D p m c f c Δ D p + m f f f Δ D p In the above equation, m c and m f represent the masses of the dried collected particles, while f c Δ D p and f f Δ D p are the particle size distributions of coarse and fine sides, respectively. A 20 mm diameter hydrocyclone was employed in this study, a center rod was inserted vertically inside the conical part, and the test section was electrically insulated from both the circular inlet and underflow box sections. Since the silica particles in the suspension are negatively charged inside an electrostatic field, in order to achieve separation by use of electrostatic force, the center rod should be controlled as the negative electrode and the conical wall as the positive one. Both the center electrode and the wall of the conical section were connected to a DC power generator. The generated electrostatic field caused by the potential difference between the wall of conical section and center electrode enables the movement of negatively charged silica particles toward the wall of the conical section, as shown in Fig. 2 . Sub-micron silica particles with 0.2 μm in median diameter and specific surface area of 22.7 m 2 /g was used as the test powder. The true density of the particles is 2.2 g/cm 3 , and their size distribution is shown in Fig. 3 . A beads mill (UAM-015 by Kotobuki Industries Co. Ltd.) was used as the method of particle dispersing before the separation experiment by the electrical hydrocyclone. Beads milling method was selected because it is effective in dispersing the sub-micron particles, and can increase the zeta potential of the particles. Under dispersing by the ultrasonic disperser device, it was found that the absolute zeta potential value was lower and the values were independent on particle diameter. The schematic representation of the beads mill apparatus is illustrated in Fig. 4 . The milling apparatus vessel contains a rotor, rotating at 2970 rpm, and 150 μm spherical silica beads in the lower side. The sub-micron silica particles suspended in the ion exchanged water were supplied into the vessel under a closed loop system. In the milling vessel, the agglomerated fine particles were forcefully broken into their well-dispersed primary size by the beads. The beads and the remaining agglomerated particles were removed from the suspension in the upper part of vessel by centrifugal force. The well-dispersed suspension was then recycled back into the suspension tank. The milling process was carried out within 30 min. After the process was finished, the suspension was kept in a calm condition for about 90 min, before the separation experiment was carried out. In the electrical hydrocyclone experiment, several experimental conditions were investigated as follows: 1. Effect of inlet flow rate ( Q = 1.2–0.1 l/min). 2. Effect of applied electro-potential (Δ V = 60–100 V). 3. Effect of pH (pH 6.5–8.5). 4. Effect of the beads mill operating condition, in this paper, the effect of the number of the beads used ( n = 1–8) on the separation performance of electrical hydrocyclone. 3 Experimental results and discussion 3.1 Relationship between the particle diameter and zeta potential The relationship between the median particle diameter and zeta potential is shown in Fig. 5 . The data shown in Fig. 5 was obtained by use of the forced centrifugal separator, under the different rotational speeds of 10,000–15,000 rpm. Larger particles are subjected to a greater negative charging, compared to the smaller ones, when the electrostatic potential is applied. Increase of the particle diameter means the increase of the interfacial area between suspended particles and the bulk liquid. Higher interfacial area implies a larger number of the ions attached at the surface of the particles. Consequently, the larger particles have greater electrical mobility compared to the smaller ones in an electrostatic field. In the electrical hydrocyclone, the larger particles might be collected at the positive electrode (the conical wall) and then move down through the lower outlet orifice. The drag force from the liquid would exceed the electrostatic force of smaller particles, and they would move through the upper outlet orifice. Hence, the separation of the particles in the electrical hydrocyclone can be achieved only by use of electrostatic force. 3.2 Effect of inlet flow rate on separation performance of electrical hydrocyclone In order to examine the effect of inlet flow rate on the separation performance of electrical hydrocyclone, the experiments were carried out under the flow rate of 1.2, 0.5 and 0.1 ℓ/min, respectively. Under such low flow rates, it is very difficult to separate the sub-micron particles without the enhancement of electrostatic force in the hydrocyclone. The applied electrostatic potential was 100 V and the suspension with normal pH (pH 6.5) was used. The influence of suspension flow rate on partial separation efficiency in electrical hydrocyclone is shown in Fig. 6 . The separation performance of electrical hydrocyclone increases with the decrease of inlet flow rate. This phenomenon contrasts with the typical hydrocyclone, in which the separation performance increases significantly as the flow rate increases. The 50% cut size corresponding to the volumetric flow rate conditions of 1.2, 0.5 and 0.1 ℓ/min conditions were about 0.49, 0.4 and 0.29 μm, respectively. The same trend has been obtained by Lim et al. [12] , by use of an electrically enhanced gas cyclone. The lower inlet velocity of the suspension means longer residence time of the particles in the electrical hydrocyclone, and results in a better particle separation. Fig. 6 also shows that with decreased inlet flow rate, the 100% cut size is shifted to a smaller region of particle diameter. Under the flow rate of 1.2, 0.5 and 0.1 ℓ/min, the 100% cut size were about 0.53, 0.45 and 0.41 μm, respectively. In the experiment, it was found that the separation of particles in the electrical hydrocyclone was not taking place under the suspension flow rate greater than 1.2 ℓ/min. Under such regions of flow rates, large particles have insufficient charge to be separated by the electrostatic force, while the centrifugal force of the particle is inadequate to enable the classification of the sub-micron silica particles. 3.3 Effect of applied electro-potential on the separation performance of the electrical hydrocyclone In order to examine the effect of electrostatic potential on the separation performance of the electrical hydrocyclone, the experiments under various electrostatic potential conditions, ranging from 60 to 100 V, were carried out. The suspension with normal pH was used in the experiment. Fig. 7 describes the effect of electrostatic potential on the separation performance of the electrical hydrocyclone. The figure shows that better separation performance is obtained under the higher applied potential, and the 100% cut size is shifted to the smaller region of particle diameter under the applied potential of 100 V, compared to conditions of 60 and 80 V. The 50% cut size are 0.37, 0.35 and 0.30 μm under the case of applied potential of 60, 80 and 100 V, respectively. The strength of electrostatic field between the center wire and the conical wall increases with the rising of the applied electrostatic potential. The increase of the electrostatic field causes the increase of the particles’ radial migration velocity, and the particles are easier to move towards the conical wall and be captured there. Hence, the higher partial separation efficiency values are obtained under the higher applied potential. 3.4 Effect of pH on separation performance of electrical hydrocyclone Since the test sub-micron silica particles are negatively charged, the negative zeta potential value of the suspension increases with the increase of the suspension pH. The zeta potential value represents the potential difference between the bulk liquid and the second layer of surrounding ions (Stern layer) near the particles. The zeta potential indirectly describes the degree of the charging state of the particles. The OH − ions released by the addition of NaOH solution into the suspension behave as additional support and increase the electrophoretic movement of particles, and subsequently increase their radial migration velocity in the electrical hydrocyclone. Fig. 8 describes the relationship between the pH of suspension and its zeta potential. In the experiment, a 0.1 M NaOH solution was used to control the pH. The negative zeta potential values increased from −42 mV under pH equal to 6.5 to about −60 mV under pH equal to 8.5. In order to investigate the effect of pH on the separation performance of the electrical hydrocyclone, the experiments were conducted under the suspension pH of 6.5, 7.5 and 8.5, respectively. Fig. 9 indicates the effect of pH on the partial separation efficiency of electrical hydrocyclone. The separation performance increases slightly with the increase of pH, and the 100% cut size is not shifted to the smaller region of particle diameter as the pH increases. The 50% cut size diameter, D p 50 , are 0.48, 0.47 and 0.42 μm under the pH of 6.5, 7.5 and 8.5, respectively. There are two phenomena regarding the mobility of the particles under different pH. First, the particle charging increases with the increase of pH, resulting in an increase of the particles’ migration velocity. Second, the current increases significantly under a constant applied potential, and the potential gradient of bulk liquid between the center rod and conical section decreases. Decrease of the potential gradient causes the decrease of the particles’ mobility. It is thought that the second phenomenon is the more dominant factor that affects the migration velocity of the particles, as the pH increases. And as the final result, the gradient of particles’ mobility decreases with the increase of pH. The partial separation efficiency shows no great improvement by increasing the pH of suspension, and the difference between the separation performances is decrease under the higher pH regions. Kobayashi et al. [21] also found that even the surface potential of silica particles increases, the gradient of particles’ mobility decreases with the increase of the pH, and becomes zero under the pH of greater than 9. Under those conditions the mobility of the particles is constant. On the other hand, the electrostatic current exhibits an extremely high value (above 150 mA) at pH 9.5. This condition is dangerous and possesses a serious risk for the apparatus. Therefore it is not recommended to classify the sub-micron silica particles in a suspension having the pH of more than 9.5 by use of an electrical hydrocyclone. 3.5 Effect of the beads mill operating condition on the separation performance of electrical hydrocyclone In this study, the number of beads used was selected as the beads mill operating conditions. The effect of the other milling condition, that is the waiting time of suspension after milling have been described in our previous report [20] . It was found that the zeta potential of the suspension is not constant after being dispersed several times by use of the same beads. Fig. 10 shows the relationship between the zeta potential of the suspension and the number of beads used. In the figure, t mill means the milling time and t wait is the waiting time, that is the calm condition time between end of dispersion by beads mill and the starting of separation by use of electrical hydrocyclone. The negative value of zeta potential increases when the beads are used from 1 to 6 times ( n = 1–6). The negative values then decrease until n = 12, and reached relatively constant value for n is greater than 12. The SEM images of the feed particles after being dispersed by the same beads for several instances of milling are shown in Fig. 11 . At n = 2, some silica particles in the suspension were found broken, while at n = 6, the silica particles indicated good spherical shape. At n = 8, the contamination of the beads was found in the suspension. It is considered that the surface charge of the particles indicates the optimum value under the perfect spherical shape of the surface, while the appearance of the beads contaminants in the suspension reduces the charging level of the particles. With the beads contaminants presence in the suspension, some of silica particles tends to stick on the surface of the contaminants and agglomerate there, as shown in Fig. 11 ( n = 8). The interfacial areas between the suspended particles and the bulk liquid decreases, and leads to the decrease of particle surface charge and the zeta potential of the suspension. Fig. 12 describes the effect of the number of beads used on the partial separation efficiency of electrical hydrocyclone. The figure shows that the separation of the sub-micron silica particles in the electrical hydrocyclone exhibits the best performance under the highest negative value of zeta potential, that is under the n = 6 condition, compared to that of under n = 2 and n = 8 conditions. The D p 50 for n = 2, 6 and 8 are about 3.9, 3.2 and 3.8 μm, respectively. It can be concluded, on the basis of our experiment, that the zeta potential of the suspension plays the most significant role in the separation of sub-micron particles by the use of the electrical hydrocyclone. Increasing the negative value of zeta potential without increasing the pH of suspension could improve the separation performance of the electrical hydrocyclone. Furthermore, the amount of broken particles and beads contamination after dispersed in the beads mill should be minimized in the next future study. Use of smaller beads in the beads mill apparatus, or lowering the rotational speed of the centrifugal rotor aiming to create the better circular shape of the particles are the recommended methods in order to improve the dispersion of the sub-micron silica suspension. 4 Proposed model In order to predict the partial separation efficiency of the electrical hydrocyclone accounting for both the particle deposition by the electrical force and diffusion phenomenon, a radially coordinated mass transfer equation in the conical section of the electrical hydrocyclone is applied, since the particle classification due to the electrostatic force takes place in this section. A mass transfer equation without tangential terms is developed, since the tangential velocity is considered negligible in this study. The equation is written as follows: (2) ν r ∂ C ∂ r + ν z ∂ C ∂ z = D r ∂ ∂ r r ∂ C ∂ r The radial and axial velocities are obtained by the following equations: (3) ν r = D p σ 10 7 ( - Δ V ) 3 μ r ln ( R / R i ) and (4) ν z = Q ∗ π R 2 - R i 2 Substituting Eqs. (3) and (4) into Eq. (2) : (5) D p σ 10 7 ( - Δ V ) 3 μ r ln ( R / R i ) ∂ C ∂ R + Q ∗ π R 2 - R i 2 ∂ C ∂ Z = D r ∂ ∂ r r ∂ c ∂ r Since Eq. (5) is too difficult to be solved analytically, the terms in the left hand of Eq. (5) are solved separately. By use the following boundary conditions: (6) C = 0 at R and R i The detailed derivation of the partial separation efficiency equation is written in Appendix . The partial separation efficiency due to electrostatic force can be written as follows: (7) Δ η E = 1 - exp - K 1 D p σ ( - Δ V ) Q ∗ + B d where (8) K 1 = 4 x 10 7 π Z 3 μ ln ( R / R i ) The partial separation efficiency due to diffusion is: (9) Δ η D = 1 - exp - K 2 D Q where (10) K 2 = 8 π Z ( R i 2 + R 2 ) ( R i 2 - R 2 ) + 1 ln ( R i / R ) D is the diffusion coefficient. In the calculation, the Brownian diffusion is considered to be taking place, since the flow within the conical section is thought to be laminar: (11) D = kT 3 π μ D p To combine the partial separation efficiency of both mechanisms, the following equation is used: (12) Δ η = Δ η e + ( 1 - Δ η e ) Δ η D The combined equation of partial separation efficiency of both the electrostatic and diffusion mechanisms is as follows: (13) Δ η = 1 - exp - K 1 D p σ ( - Δ V ) + K 2 D Q + B d exp - K 2 D Q In Eq. (13) , the only unknown parameter is the surface charge density, σ . The value of σ can be found by fitting the calculated results to the experimental data, with the value of σ as the fitting parameter. By fitting, it can be concluded that the value is about −3.89 × 10 −6 C/cm 2 . Fig. 13a shows the comparison between the experimental and calculated results of the effect of inlet flow rate, while Fig. 13b shows the case of the effect of applied electrostatic potential on the partial separation efficiency of the electrical hydrocyclone. The predictions of partial separation efficiency are on the qualitative agreement with the experimental data. 5 Conclusions Experimental studies about the separation performance of the special electrical hydrocyclone have been conducted, and a model based on the mass transfer phenomenon in the conical section has been built in order to predict the partial separation efficiency of the electrical hydrocyclone. The obtained conclusions are as follows: (i) The negative zeta potential of the sub-micron silica particles increases with the increase of the particle diameter, hence the classification by use of applied electrostatic potential in the hydrocyclone was possible. (ii) The partial separation efficiency of the electrical hydrocyclone increases with the decrease of the inlet flow rate. (iii) The partial separation efficiency of the electrical hydrocyclone increases with the increase of the applied electrostatic potential. (iv) The partial separation efficiency of the electrical hydrocyclone slightly increases with the increase of the pH values of the suspension. (v) The zeta potential of the solution is not constant after being dispersed several times by the use of the same beads mill. It is found that particles which dispersed under the condition of being milled six times have the best circular shape and the lowest zeta potential. Under that milling condition, the best separation performance of the special electrical hydrocyclone was achieved. (vi) The estimation of the new model based on the mass transfer mechanism which accounts for the partial separation efficiency due to the electrostatic force and diffusion is qualitatively in agreement with the experimental results. Appendix The derivation of the model based on the diffusive mass transfer equation in order to calculate the partial separation efficiency is explained in this section. Fig. 14 describes the assumption made in the model development. The fluid flow and particles axial movement and flow splitting in the real condition of hydrocyclone is described in Fig. 14 a. The fluid flow and the flow splitting is simplified as shown in Fig. 14 b in order to build a simpler model, since only the underflow ratio is considered has a significant effect in particle deposition in case of electrical hydrocyclone. The average radius of conical section is used in the model development. Fig. 14 c shows the particle deposition mechanism due to the electrical force in the electrostatic field inside the conical section of hydrocyclone. The radial velocity of particles in the conical section of electrical hydrocyclone, due to the electrostatic force is as follows: (A1) ν r = D p σ 10 7 E r 3 μ (A2) E r = - Δ V r ln ( R / R i ) Therefore, Eq. (1) can be rewritten as: (A3) ν r = D p σ 10 7 ( - Δ V ) 3 μ r ln ( R / R i ) In order to account for the effect of diffusion in partial separation efficiency, a mass transport equation in the domain of the conical section is built as follows: (A4) ν r ∂ c ∂ r + ν θ r ∂ C ∂ θ + ν z ∂ C ∂ Z = D r ∂ ∂ r r ∂ C ∂ r And assuming that the particle concentration is not varying in tangential direction, Eq. (4) can be rewritten as: (A5) ν r ∂ C ∂ r + ν z ∂ C ∂ z = D r ∂ ∂ r r ∂ C ∂ r Eq. (5) is too complex to be solved analytically, then assumption of individual deposition mechanism must be made. Define the axial velocity as: (A6) ν z = Q ∗ π ( R 2 - R i 2 ) At first, we assume that the hydrocyclone is operated under no underflow condition. Under that case, the axially downward volumetric flow rate is equal to Q at the top of the conical section, and equal to 0 at the bottom, Q ∗ is assumed equal to 0.5 Q , Eq. (5) can be rewritten as: (A7) D p σ 10 7 ( - Δ V ) 3 μ r ln ( R / R i ) ∂ C ∂ r + Q ∗ π ( R 2 - R i 2 ) ∂ C ∂ Z = D r ∂ ∂ r r ∂ C ∂ r 1. Particle separation efficiency due to electrostatic force If electrostatic force is the only driving force of particle radial migration, the diffusion term is equal to zero: (A8) D p σ 10 7 ( - Δ V ) 3 μ r ln ( R / R i ) ∂ C ∂ r + Q ∗ π ( R 2 - R i 2 ) ∂ C ∂ Z = 0 (A9) D p σ 10 7 ( - Δ V ) 3 μ r ln ( R / R i ) ∂ C ∂ r = - Q ∗ π ( R 2 - R i 2 ) ∂ C ∂ Z (A10) D p σ 10 7 ( - Δ V ) 3 μ ln ( R / R i ) dC = - Q ∗ π ( R 2 - R i 2 ) ∂ C ∂ Z rdr Integration of Eq. (10) , gives: (A11) D p σ 10 7 ( - Δ V ) 3 μ ln ( R / R i ) C = - Q ∗ π ( R 2 - R i 2 ) ∂ C ∂ Z r 2 2 + A Defining the boundary conditions: C = 0 at r = R i (A12) R i 2 2 + A = 0 , A = - R i 2 2 Eq. (11) can be rewritten as: (A13) C ( r ) = - 3 μ ln ( R / R i ) Q ∗ D p σ 10 7 ( - Δ V ) π ( R 2 - R i 2 ) ∂ C ∂ z ( r 2 - R i 2 ) 2 In order to solve Eq. (13) , the mean value of C ( r ) should used, therefore the mean value is defined as: (A14) C ¯ ( r ) = 1 π ( R 2 - R i 2 ) ∫ R i R C ( r ) 2 π rdr (A15) C ¯ ( r ) = - 3 μ ln ( R / R i ) Q ∗ D p σ 10 7 ( - Δ V ) π ( R 2 - R i 2 ) 2 ( R 2 - R i 2 ) × ∂ C ¯ ∂ Z ∫ R i R ( r 2 - R i 2 ) 2 rdr Integration of Eq. (A15) gives: (A16) C ¯ ( r ) = - 3 μ ln ( R / R i ) Q ∗ 4 D p σ 10 7 ( - Δ V ) π ∂ C ¯ ∂ Z Rearranging of Eq. (A16) yields: (A17) d C ¯ C ¯ = - 4 D p σ 10 7 ( - Δ v ) π 3 μ In ( R / R i ) Q ∗ dz Integrating of Eq. (A17) results: (A18) ∫ C ¯ in C ¯ out d C ¯ C ¯ = - 4 D p σ 10 7 ( - Δ V ) π 3 μ ln ( R / R i ) Q ∗ ∫ 0 z dz (A19) ln C ¯ out C ¯ ln = - 4 D p σ 10 7 ( - Δ V ) π Z 3 μ In ( R / R i ) Q ∗ The partial separation efficiency in the electrical hydrocyclone due to the electrostatic force is defined as: (A20) Δ η E = 1 - C ¯ out C ¯ in = 1 - exp - 4 D p σ 10 7 ( - Δ V ) π Z 3 μ In ( R / R i ) Q ∗ Eq. (A20) can be simplified as: (A21) Δ η E = 1 - exp - K 1 D p σ ( - Δ V ) Q ∗ While (A22) K 1 = 4 x 10 7 π Z 3 μ In ( R / R i ) For the hydrocyclone system with underflow ratio of B d , this underflow ratio must be added into Eq. (A21) (A23) Δ η E = 1 - exp - K 1 D p σ ( - Δ V ) Q ∗ + B d 2. Particle separation efficiency due to diffusion If diffusion is the driving force of particle radial movement, the electrical mobility term in Eq. (5) can be neglected: (A24) Q ∗ π R 2 - R i 2 ∂ C ∂ Z = D r ∂ ∂ r r ∂ C ∂ r (A25) Q ∗ π R 2 - R i 2 ∂ C ∂ Z rdr = Dd r ∂ C ∂ r Integrating Eq. (A25) , resulting: (A26) Q ∗ π ( R 2 - R i 2 ) ∂ C ∂ z r 2 2 + A = D r ∂ C ∂ r (A27) Q ∗ π R 2 - R i 2 ∂ C ∂ Z r 2 + A r dr = D ( dc ) Integrating Eq. (A27) , resulting: (A28) Q ∗ π ( R 2 - R i 2 ) ∂ C ∂ z r 2 4 + Alnr + B = DC Defining the boundary conditions: c = 0 at r = R and R i (A29) R 2 4 + AlnR + B = 0 , R i 2 4 + AlnR i + B = 0 A can be found by equating both equations in Eq. (A29) (A30) A = ( R 2 - R i 2 ) 4 ln ( R i / R ) B can be found by: (A31) R i 2 4 + ( R 2 - R i 2 ) 4 ln ( R i / R ) lnR i + B = 0 (A32) B = - R 2 ln ( R i / R ) + ( R 2 - R i 2 ) ln R i 4 ln ( R i / R ) Eq. (A28) can be rewritten as: (A33) Q ∗ π R 2 - R i 2 ∂ C ∂ z r 2 - R i 2 4 + R 2 - R i 2 4 ln ( R i / R ) ln r R i = DC ( r ) In order to solve Eq. (A33) , the mean value of C ( r ) should used, therefore the mean value is defined as: (A34) C ¯ ( r ) = 1 π R 2 - R i 2 ∫ Ri R C ( r ) 2 π rdr Eq. (A33) can be rewritten as: (A35) C ( r ) = Q ∗ π D R 2 - R i 2 ∂ C ∂ z r 2 - R i 2 4 + R 2 - R i 2 4 ln ( R i / R ) ln r R i Substituting Eq. (A35) into Eq. (A34) and assuming that concentration gradient in z direction is independent along the radial axis: (A36) C ¯ ( r ) = Q ∗ π D R 2 - R i 2 2 R 2 - R i 2 ∂ C ¯ ∂ z ∫ Ri R r 2 - R i 2 4 + R 2 - R i 2 4 ln ( R i / R ) ln r R i rdr Integration gives: (A37) C ¯ ( r ) = - Q ∗ 8 π D ∂ C ¯ ∂ z ( R i 2 + R 2 ) ( R i 2 - R 2 ) + 1 ln ( R i / R ) Rearranging Eq. (A37) yields: (A38) d C ¯ C ¯ = - 8 π D Q ∗ ( R i 2 + R 2 ) ( R i 2 - R 2 ) + 1 ln ( R i / R ) dz Integrating results: (A39) ∫ C ¯ in C ¯ out d C ¯ C ¯ = - 8 π D Q ∗ ( R i 2 + R 2 ) ( R i 2 - R 2 ) + 1 ln ( R i / R ) ∫ 0 Z dZ (A40) ln C ¯ out C ¯ in = - 8 π DZ Q ∗ ( R i 2 + R 2 ) ( R i 2 - R 2 ) + 1 ln ( R i / R ) The partial separation efficiency due to the diffusion can be written as: (A41) Δ η D = 1 - c ¯ out c ¯ in = 1 - exp - 8 π DZ Q ∗ ( R i 2 + R 2 ) ( R i 2 - R 2 ) + 1 ln ( R i / R ) Eq.

In order to evaluate the presence of glaucoma, the ophthalmologist may determine the cup and disc areas and diagnose glaucoma using a vertical cup-to-disc ratio. However, determination of the cup area is very difficult, thus we propose a method to measure the cup-to-disc ratio using a vertical profile on the optic disc. The edge of optic disc was then detected by use of a canny edge detection filter. The profile was then obtained around the center of the optic disc in the vertical direction. Subsequently, the edge of the cup area on the vertical profile was determined by thresholding technique. Lastly, the vertical cup-to-disc ratio was calculated. Using seventy nine images, including twenty five glaucoma images, the sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 85% were achieved with this method.",

Estrogens have significant roles in a variety of biological events, such as the development and maintenance of female reproductive organs, and bone and lipid metabolism. Previous studies demonstrated that estrogens suppress IL-6-induced osteoporosis and the growth of multiple myeloma cells by repressing IL-6 and IL-6 receptor gene expression. Here we present a novel mechanism for the inhibitory effect of estrogens on IL-6 function. IL-6-induced activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activity and STAT3-mediated gene expression were suppressed by 17beta-estradiol (E2) in breast cancer cells. E2-mediated inhibition of STAT3 activation was reversed by tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist. We provide evidence that the inhibitory action of ER on STAT3 activity was due to direct physical interactions between STAT3 and ER which represents a novel form of cross-talk between STAT3 and ER signaling pathways.",

This prospective study included 59 NTG and 20 POAG patients treated with the following four dosing regimens of latanoprost: patients on no previous medication received latanoprost as initial therapy (Group 1, n=31), patients on beta-blocker therapy received latanoprost as adjunctive therapy (Group II, n=9), patients on unoprostone monotherapy were switched to latanoprost monotherapy (Group III, n=14), and patients previously on dual therapy with isopropyl unoprostone and beta-blocker were switched to a combined treatment of latanoprost and beta-blocker (Group IV, n=25). IOP significantly decreased 8 weeks after initiation of latanoprost therapy by 19.9% in Group I, 20.5% in Group II, 16.6% in Group III, and 12.2% in Group IV. In Groups I and II, there was a significant positive correlation between the magnitude of IOP reduction induced by latanoprost and the IOP level before latanoprost therapy. The IOP level before latanoprost therapy is a contributing factor in the IOP-lowering efficacy of latanoprost. Latanoprost is more effective in lowering IOP than isopropyl unoprostone.",

The experimental results show that for DPPC monolayers of the two pure enantiomers, the π-A isotherms and the MDC behaviors are similar to each other, while the domain patterns of them are mirror shapes of different sizes. This reveals that MDC behaviors due to molecular spontaneous polarization have no relation to chirality but domain shapes closely depend on the molecular chirality. Moreover, the observed domain shapes verify the domain shape theory which was recently developed by Iwamoto et al. [M. Iwamoto, Z.C. Ou-Yang, Phy. Rev. Letts, 93 (2004) 206101].",

        "abstract": "To determine the phenotype of an Australian pedigree with the myocilin (MYOC) Gly252Arg mutation, comparing it with other pedigrees carrying the same mutation.All recruited subjects underwent a comprehensive clinical examination, including optic disc assessment, applanation tonometry, and visual field measurement. Mutation analysis was performed through direct sequencing. Haplotype analysis was performed using microsatellite markers around the MYOC gene.Eight Gly252Arg mutation carriers with glaucoma were identified from the same pedigree. Carriers' mean +/- SD age at diagnosis was 46.3 +/- 11.4 years (range, 31-60 years). Highest recorded intraocular pressure ranged from 27 to 42 mm Hg (mean +/- SD, 32.4 +/- 5.6 mm Hg). Cup-disc ratios in the worst eye ranged from 0.6 to 0.9. Six of the 8 individuals had undergone filtration surgery. A common founding haplotype between MY5 and D1S218 was found for Caucasian individuals tested with this mutation. One subject was compound heterozygotic for the MYOC Gly252Arg mutation and a novel MYOC Gly244Val variant.Although a common founder for Gly252Arg across Caucasian subjects was found, the phenotype from this Australian MYOC mutation-carrying pedigree is less severe than previously described. The severity of glaucoma caused by the Gly252Arg mutation may be similar to the Thr377Met MYOC mutation, yet is more severe than the most common Gln368Stop mutation.Since its implication in glaucoma, much work has been performed investigating the clinical features of MYOC-related glaucoma. Given the strong genotype-phenotype correlations with MYOC disease-causing variants, health care professionals armed with such molecular information are able to accurately counsel patients on their likely disease course. Our work suggests that the disease associated with MYOC Gly252Arg is less severe than previously described in other pedigrees with this specific mutation.",

The preoperative intraocular pressure of the eyes ranged from 11 to 18 mm Hg with a mean (+/- SD) of 14.1 +/- 1.9 mm Hg. Follow-up examinations were performed at least once a month for 14-35 months (mean: 24.4 months).Intraocular pressures decreased to between 4 and 14 mm Hg with a mean (+/- SD) of 8.4 +/- 2.4 mm Hg at the last three follow-up visits. The magnitude of the intraocular pressure reduction ranged from 1 to 10 mm Hg, with a mean of 5.8 mm Hg. Final measurements of postoperative intraocular pressure ranged between 5 and 12 mm Hg in 27 eyes (87%). Visual acuity deteriorated two lines or more in seven eyes, which was caused by cataract. The visual field deteriorated postoperatively in two eyes (6%): their respective postoperative intraocular pressures averaged 9.4 and 7.5 mm Hg. Hypotonous maculopathy developed in three eyes (10%).Trabeculectomy with mitomycin C appears to have potential as a treatment modality of choice for normal-tension glaucoma, because a large majority of the patients in the present study achieved an intraocular pressure allegedly beneficial in managing normal-tension glaucoma.",

Methods: Twenty-four patients (aged 16-75 years; Karnofsky performance scale score 60% or more before initiation of FRT) with newly diagnosed GBM received a total dose of 60 Gy of FRT with daily concurrent TMZ. After a 4-week interval, the patients received three AFTV injections and the first course of TMZ maintenance chemotherapy for 5 days, followed by multiple courses of TMZ for 5 days in each 28-day cycle. Results: This treatment regimen was well toleratedby all patients. The percent of patients with progression-free survival (PFS) ≥24 months was 33%.

Transient retinal ischemia for 60 minutes was achieved by a subsequent systemic administration of tissue-type plasminogen activator to reperfuse the occluded vessel. Samples of retinas were excised from the animals killed 3, 9, 12, 24, 48, and 78 hours after the reperfusion. The experimental data were processed using the TdT-dUTP terminal nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method to detect apoptotic cells.The transient retinal ischemia caused time-sequential apoptotic changes in the retinal cells as evaluated by counting the number of TUNEL-positive cells. The most remarkable changes occurred in the central area of retina, and further on the sections taken 24 hours after reperfusion. The peripheral area was less affected, and the outer nuclear cell layer was almost unaffected throughout the observation period.The proposed method to cause retinal transient ischemia is highly reproducible, and it is easy to simulate the progress and topographical distribution of retinal changes observed in the clinical cases of central retinal arterial occlusion and its subsequent thrombolytic reperfusion. This may provide a useful tool for constructing the effective thrombolytic strategies against the central retinal arterial occlusion and for evaluating the effects of neuroprotective agents.",

        "abstract": "The effects of substrate temperature, T s , on the crystallinity and the electrical properties of Ga-doped ZnO films (GZO) with a thickness of 200 nm were investigated. GZO films were prepared on glass substrates at various T s in the range from 150 to 400 °C by ion-plating method with DC arc discharge. X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that GZO film prepared at 250 °C shows the preferential orientation of c -axis and the highest crystallinity. Williamson–Hall analysis indicates that the crystallite size of GZO films remains nearly constant with increasing T s up to 300 °C, and then, with further increasing T s , decreases gradually. The Ga concentration in the films, estimated by secondary ion mass spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence analyses, increases monotonically with increasing T s above 250 °C. Hall effect measurements show that resistivity decreases slightly with increasing T s up to 250 °C, leading to the lowest resistivity of 2.1 × 10 − 4  Ω cm at 250 °C, and then exhibits a gradual increase with further increasing T s . Keywords ZnO GZO Transparent conductive film Ion plating Substrate temperature Low resistivity 1 Introduction Polycrystalline ZnO films on glass and plastic substrates have been extensively developed for many applications such as transparent electrodes, sensors, thin film transistors, and microwave shielding. In particular, low resistivity ZnO films with high visible transmittance and small surface roughness allow for the application to transparent electrodes of this material. At present, indium tin oxide (ITO) is mainly used as the electrodes in various optoelectronics devices. However, it has the problem of limited resource of its principal component, indium. Thus, ZnO films composed of low cost and abundant material are expected at the moment as an alternative to ITO electrodes in large size devices such as flat panel displays and solar cells. We have deposited Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) films on glass substrate at 200 °C by an ion-plating method with a DC arc discharge. This deposition system works very well from an industrial view point, because it enables the deposition of GZO films: 1) with low plasma damage, 2) at high rate of e.g. 170 nm/min, and 3) on large-area substrate [1,2] . In our previous works [3,4] , the effects of O 2 gas flow rate during the deposition, Ga 2 O 3 content in target source and film thickness on the electrical properties of GZO films have been investigated. Consequently, we have succeeded in obtaining a resistivity as low as 2.2 × 10 − 4  Ω cm in GZO film with a thickness of 200 nm on glass substrate at a temperature of 200 °C. The aim of this work is to investigate the effects of substrate temperature, T s , on the crystallinity and the electrical properties of GZO films. The variation in the electrical properties of GZO films with T s is investigated in terms of its crystallinity, crystallite size and Ga concentration. 2 Experimental GZO films were deposited on alkali-free glass substrate by ion-plating system with DC arc discharge using a pressure-gradient-type plasma gun [5] . In this deposition system, the substrate traveled through the deposition room for the film growth. A series of GZO films with a thickness of 200 ± 5 nm was prepared at various T s in the range from 150 to 400 °C. Deposition rate of GZO films strongly depended on T s . As will be shown in Fig. 1 , the difference in the deposition rates between GZO films prepared at T s of 150 °C and 400 °C was about 85 nm/min. Therefore, the traveling speed of the substrate was adjusted in the range of 3 to 6 mm/s to realize the same thickness of 200 nm in all GZO films. The substrate was rinsed ultrasonically in deionized water and isopropyl alcohol, and then jet-dried using high-purity nitrogen gas. A base pressure in the vacuum chamber prior to deposition was about 2.0 × 10 − 5  Pa. After evacuation of the chamber, argon and oxygen gases were introduced at the gas flow rate of 140 and 8 sccm, respectively. The deposition pressure was 2.2 × 10 − 1  Pa. A sintered ZnO ceramic target which contains a Ga 2 O 3 powder of 4 wt.% was used as a source material (99.99% purity, Hakusui Tech.). The applied DC arc discharge current between the target and the plasma gun was automatically controlled to be about 142 A. The distance from the target to the traveling substrate was fixed at about 0.6 m. Thickness of the film was measured by using a surface profilometer (Alfa-Step, IQ). Crystallinity and crystallite size of the films were characterized by high-resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD: RIGAKU, ATX-G system) analysis using CuKα radiation ( λ = 1.5406 Å). The electrical properties of the films were characterized by Hall effect measurements in the van der Pauw configuration (Accent, HL5500PC) at room temperature. Ga concentration in the films was estimated by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy analyses. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Deposition rate Fig. 1 shows the deposition rate of GZO films as a function of T s . From Fig. 1 , it is obvious that the deposition rate decreases monotonously from 200 to 115 nm/min, as the T s increased from 150 to 400 °C. For this result, we have confirmed that there is no change of deposition parameters other than T s . During the deposition, the total and O 2 partial pressure remained a constant independently of T s , respectively. The plasma conditions such as arc current, discharge voltage and target bias etc. were also the same among the samples. Thus, it is suggested that the decrease of the deposition rate is only due to the increase of the T s . The increase of the T s enhances the migration of species on the surface. This will possibly lead to the formation of more dense film. The increase of film density could effectively decrease the deposition rate. In addition, desorption from the film has been often attributed to the decrease of deposition rate with the increase of T s . We observed in a thermal desorption spectroscopy analysis that, by a post-annealing at the temperature above about 300 °C, zinc begins to desorb from the film prepared at 200 °C. Accordingly, the decrease of the deposition rate may be explained by the migration effect and the desorption of zinc. 3.2 Crystalline quality and crystallite size In order to investigate the crystallinity of GZO films prepared at different T s , out-of-plane XRD measurements were performed. Fig. 2 shows a typical XRD θ –2 θ scan profile of GZO film prepared at 250 °C. The diffraction intensity on the vertical axis in Fig. 2 is expressed in a logarithmic scale. In Fig. 2 , only two diffraction peaks from ZnO (0002) and (0004) planes were observed, where no other phases were detected. All the films prepared at different T s basically showed same diffraction pattern. This result indicates that the films are composed of a wurtzite type hexagonal structure and have a preferential orientation of c -axis normal to the substrate plane. It is well known that ZnO films consist of columnar grains grown with the c -axis orientation [6] . The full width at half maximum of the (0002) diffraction peak, FWHM θ –2 θ scan , is plotted as a function of T s in Fig. 3 . The FWHM θ –2 θ scan decreases with increasing T s from 150 to 200 °C. It seems to be a plateau in the T s range from 200 to 300 °C, and then increases gradually with further increasing T s up to 400 °C. The decrease in the FWHM θ –2 θ scan represents the improvement of the film crystallinity. Thus, these experimental findings indicate that the GZO film deposited at the T s around 250 °C has the highest crystallinity. The improvement of the crystallinity can be probably explained by the enhancement of the migration effect, as described in Section 3.1 . On the contrary, the crystallinity is deteriorated at the higher T s more than 300 °C. This is attributed to the increase of Ga concentration into the films, as will be shown in Fig. 6 . In our previous work [3] , we reported that the crystallinity of GZO films is deteriorated by the increase of the Ga concentration. Next, a crystallite size of a -axis parallel to the substrate plane was estimated from in-plane XRD data analysis on the basis of a Williamson–Hall method [7] . Fig. 4 shows the crystallite size as a function of T s . With increasing T s up to 300 °C, the crystallite size remained nearly constant at approximately 30 nm, and then, with further increasing T s , reduced to about 20 nm. Here, the crystallite size will be related to a nucleation density in the initial stage of film deposition. As described in Section 3.1 , the migration and desorption effects were argued as a factor causing the decrease of the deposition rate with increasing T s . The enhancement of the migration generally limits the density of nuclei formed in the nucleation stage, and simultaneously, this effect contributes the crystallite growth of the a -axis with the lowest surface energy plane. However, the result of Fig. 4 differs from this consideration. The desorption of zinc could be remarkable at higher temperature. The desorption may affect the nucleation stage and result in the decrease of crystallite size. A further study is necessary to reveal that. 3.3 Ga profile SIMS measurements were performed with Cs + primary ions to investigate the distribution of Ga in GZO films. The Ga concentration was quantified using the relative sensitivity factor, which was obtained by measuring the Ga-implanted ZnO reference sample. The reference sample was prepared by Ga ion implantation to an undoped-ZnO polycrystalline film, where the Ga ions are implanted at a dose of 5 × 10 14 ions/cm 2 , with an acceleration voltage of 200 keV. The error range was estimated within ± 10%. A SIMS profile of GZO film prepared at 250 °C is shown in Fig. 5 . The artificial peak located at a depth of 200 nm probably corresponds to the interface between the film and substrate, as indicated by a broken line. From Fig. 5 , the distribution of the Ga concentration was found to be nearly uniform from the surface to the interface. 3.4 Electrical properties Fig. 6 shows the resistivity, carrier concentration and Hall mobility of GZO films as a function of T s . In addition, the Ga concentration in the films, estimated by SIMS and XRF analyses, is also shown. As seen from Figs. 3 and 6 , it should be noted that the variation trend in the resistivity with T s is very similar to that of FWHM θ –2 θ scan . This suggests that the crystallinity of the films can be closely associated with the behavior of the electrical properties. In Fig. 6 , their variation trends with T s could be mainly divided into two regions; Region I up to 250 °C, where the resistivity indicates a slight decrease, and Region II above 300 °C, where the resistivity increases gradually. In Region I, the carrier concentration and the Ga concentration of GZO films are not directly affected by T s , while the Hall mobility increases, where the FWHM θ –2 θ scan decreases with increasing T s in this range. The increase of Hall mobility can be explained by the improvement of the crystallinity. As a result, at T s of 250 °C, the lowest resistivity of 2.1 × 10 − 4  Ω cm was obtained in GZO film with carrier concentration of 1.1 × 10 21  cm − 3 and Hall mobility of 27.6 cm 2 /Vs. In addition, as shown in Fig. 4 , the crystallite size remains a constant in Region I. In Region II, both the carrier concentration and Hall mobility decreased. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4 , the deterioration of the crystallinity and the reduction of the crystallite size are observed with increasing T s in this range. They correspond to the increase of scattering and trapping factors for carrier electron in the grain and grain boundary, respectively. In addition, the Ga concentration in Region II is higher than that in Region I. This will be induced by the desorption of zinc from the film, as described in Section 3.1 . Excess Ga will give rise to the segregation of Ga-oxides in the films, which acts as a donor killer. However, we have obtained no direct evidence concerning the structure of the grain boundary to date. 4 Summary The effects of substrate temperature, T s , in the range from 150 to 400 °C on the crystallinity and electrical properties of GZO films were investigated. Deposition rate of the films decreases monotonically from 200 to 115 nm/min with increasing T s . XRD analysis shows the improvement of the film crystallinity with increasing T s up to 250 °C, while, at higher T s , they are deteriorated. Williamson–Hall analysis indicates the crystallite size decrease from 30 to 20 nm with increasing T s above 300 °C. SIMS and XRF measurements reveal that Ga concentration changes a little with increasing T s up to 250 °C, while, at higher T s , an increase in Ga concentration is observed. Hall effect measurements show that the lowest resistivity of 2.1 × 10 − 4  Ω cm is obtained in GZO film at 250 °C.

        "title": "Effects of the O2 flow rate and post-deposition thermal annealing on the optical absorption spectra of Ga-doped ZnO films",
        "abstract": "The optical absorption spectra of polycrystalline Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) thin films deposited by ion plating with direct current arc discharge have been studied. The GZO films that were deficient in oxygen showed absorption in the visible wavelength range. The intensity of the absorption band decreased with increasing O 2 flow rate during the deposition. Post-deposition thermal annealing in air and in a N 2 gas atmosphere also decreased the intensity of the absorption band. The intensity of the absorption band showed a slight correlation with carrier concentrations in the GZO films. The absorption intensity decreased with the decrease of the carrier concentration and diminished at a carrier concentration of around 7 × 10 20 cm − 3 . The contribution of carriers from native donors to transport in GZO films is discussed. Keywords ZnO Ga Transparent conductive oxide Optical absorption Optical property 1 Introduction Heavily Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) films are one of the most promising candidates for transparent electrodes in flat panel display applications [1–3] . Recently, we reported the feasibility of GZO films as practical common electrodes on color filter substrates in thin film transistor liquid crystal displays (TFT-LCD) [4,5] . In addition to their electrical properties, their optical properties are essential characteristics of transparent electrodes. Generally, the optical properties are characterized by transmission, reflection, and absorption spectra. The optical absorption spectrum is the most important because it directly influences the optical characteristics of TFT-LCD panels. In transparent conductive oxide (TCO) films, the optical absorption is related to the electrical properties of the films [6] . In the near-infrared wavelength region, free carrier absorption is the dominant contribution to optical absorption, whereas the fundamental optical band gap absorption is the main feature in the short wavelength ultraviolet region. The optical band gap could be shifted by its carrier concentration through Burstein–Moss effects [7] . In the visible wavelength region, we may observe some absorption bands due to defects or impurities, which form deep level electronic states within the band gap. Thus, the optical absorption gives some information on defects, impurities, and electronic states in TCO thin films. However, very few studies have paid attention to such optical absorption spectra in ZnO-based TCO films. We have studied the deposition of low resistivity and highly transparent polycrystalline GZO films on glass and plastic substrates by an ion plating method with direct current arc discharge [1,3] . It is well known that the electrical properties of GZO films are strongly affected by the O 2 partial pressure during deposition [8,9] . Post-deposition annealing also affects the electrical properties of GZO films [10,11] . Furthermore, the thermal stability of GZO films is poor in the case of ambient oxidation, as in an air atmosphere [12] . In both cases, oxygen will play a crucial role in altering the electrical properties of GZO films. However, the detailed mechanism of this alteration has not been fully understood. Studies on optical absorption spectra could give some insight on this point of view. In this study, we examine the changes in the optical absorption spectrum as a function of the O 2 flow rate during deposition and due to post-deposition thermal annealing for polycrystalline GZO films deposited by the ion plating method. 2 Experimental procedures GZO films, 150 nm in thickness, were deposited on alkali-free glass substrates (Corning 1737) by an ion plating method with direct current (DC) arc discharge. The details of the deposition system have been reported elsewhere [13,14] . The substrate temperature was settled at about 110 °C, which is low enough compared to the heat resistance of color filters, which are composed of organic materials. Sintered tablets of ZnO (purity 99.99%) containing 4 wt.% Ga 2 O 3 (purity 99.9%) (Hakusui Tech, SKY-Z) were used as the evaporation source. During the deposition, high purity Ar and O 2 gases were introduced into the deposition chamber. The flow rate of Ar gas was 240 sccm and that of the O 2 gas was varied from 8 to 14 sccm. The base pressure and deposition pressure were ~ 9 × 10 − 5 Pa and ~ 0.5 Pa, respectively. The discharge current was 100 A. The electrical properties of the GZO films were characterized by Hall effect measurements using the Van der Pauw method (Nanometrics, HL5500PC) at room temperature. Optical transmission and reflection measurements were carried out at room temperature in the wavelength range between 250 and 2500 nm using a grating spectrometer (Hitachi, U4100) with an angle of incidence for light of 5°. Then the optical absorption coefficient α was obtained using the formula α = 1 d ln 100 − R T , where, d is the film thickness, and R and T are the reflectance and transmittance, respectively. 3 Results and discussion The electrical properties of GZO films deposited by the ion plating method were affected by the O 2 flow rate during deposition [14] . We obtained the minimum resistivity with an O 2 flow rate of 11 sccm and a substrate temperature of about 110 °C. We selected three typical samples to study, the GZO film deposited at the optimum condition (11 sccm), the film deposited at a lower O 2 flow rate (8 sccm) and the film deposited at a higher O 2 flow rate (14 sccm). The resistivity ρ , Hall mobility μ , and carrier concentration N , determined by the Hall measurements on the GZO films are summarized in Table 1 . The actual Ga concentrations in the GZO films, which were evaluated by X-ray fluorescence analysis, are also indicated as a reference. The minimum resistivity of 2.8 × 10 − 4 Ω cm was obtained at the O 2 flow rate of 11 sccm. The carrier concentration monotonously decreased as the O 2 flow rate increased. However, the Hall mobility rapidly increased up to the optimal point with increasing O 2 flow rate. Then it saturated or only slightly increased beyond the optimum condition. Note that the Ga concentration was regarded as nearly the same, independent of the O 2 flow rate within the present range. Accordingly, the decrease in carrier concentration with increasing O 2 flow rate is predominantly caused by the O 2 gas, which assists in the oxidation of the films. The decrease in carrier concentration can be tentatively attributed to effects of some intrinsic defects. The average transmittance in the visible wavelength region was more than 85% for all samples. However, we found some changes in the optical absorption spectra depending on the O 2 flow rate. The optical absorption spectra of the as-deposited GZO films are shown in Fig. 1 . Free carrier absorption and fundamental optical gap absorption are observed as the main contributions in the near-infrared wavelength region and in the ultraviolet region, respectively. These features are typical characteristics of optical absorption spectra in TCO films. Weak tail absorption below the optical gap absorption was extended to around 400 nm. It can be seen that the intensity of the free carrier absorption decreased as the O 2 flow rate increased. On the other hand, the fundamental optical gap absorption shifted to a long wavelength as the O 2 flow rate increased. These observations are consistent with a change of carrier concentration. In addition, we found that an absorption band in the visible wavelength range between 400 and 600 nm clearly appeared in the films deposited with an 8-sccm O 2 flow rate. To see the change in the absorption in the visible range more clearly, we subtracted the tail of the free carrier absorption, assuming a relationship between α and wavelength λ , α ∝ λ p [15] , for the short wavelength region. The absorption spectra after the subtraction are plotted as a function of photon energy in Fig. 2 . We can see that the intensity of the absorption band between 2 eV and 3 eV decreased with increasing O 2 flow rate, and the absorption nearly diminished at the O 2 flow rate of 14 sccm. The optical absorption in this energy region can be attributed to some intrinsic defects in the GZO films. The absorption band observed below the band gap in undoped ZnO has been as ascribed to oxygen vacancies acting as native donors in ZnO [16,17] . Although the origin of the absorption band observed in the GZO films with the O 2 -deficient deposition condition is not clear, the decrease in the intensity of the absorption band suggests a decrease in the density of some defects in the GZO films as the O 2 flow rate increased during the deposition. This is consistent with a previous Raman scattering study [18] . In the Raman measurements of GZO films [18] , a Raman mode that was ascribed to oxygen vacancies decreased as the O 2 flow rate increased during the deposition of GZO films by the ion plating method. The influence of post-deposition thermal annealing on the electrical properties of GZO films deposited by the ion plating method has already been reported for the optimized O 2 flow rate [9,11] . In this study, we examined the GZO films deposited at the slightly O 2 -deficient condition of 8 sccm, which results in the prominent optical absorption in the visible wavelength range, to determine the effects of post-deposition annealing on the absorption band. The GZO films deposited at 8 sccm were annealed for 30 min both in air and in a pure N 2 gas atmosphere at the temperatures between 200 and 450 °C. The electrical properties were strongly affected by the post-deposition annealing. Fig. 3 shows the resistivity ρ , Hall mobility μ , and carrier concentration N of GZO films after post-deposition thermal annealing as a function of the annealing temperature T anneal . The resistivity was either stable or slightly decreased up to 300 °C in air and up to 400 °C in the N 2 gas atmosphere as T anneal increased. Then the resistivity began to increase beyond these critical temperatures. As shown in Fig. 3 (b) and (c), the Hall mobility increased and the carrier concentration decreased as T anneal increased up to the critical temperatures. Beyond the critical temperatures, both the Hall mobility and carrier concentration abruptly decreased. These observations are similar to the case of GZO films deposited at the optimal O 2 flow rate of 11 sccm [12] . The increase in μ and the decrease in N in the case of the N 2 gas atmosphere have been discussed in relation to the desorption of interstitial zinc, which is considered to act as a native donor in GZO [10] . The optical absorption spectra after annealing in air are displayed in Fig. 4 . Here the tail of the free carrier absorption was also subtracted. It can be seen that the intensity of the absorption band in the visible wavelength region decreased as T anneal increased. In the case of annealing in the N 2 atmosphere, we observed the same behavior. This suggests that a similar change in the GZO films occurred in both air and N 2 gas atmospheres. In addition, the variation in the optical absorption by post-deposition annealing was also similar to the dependence on the O 2 flow rate during deposition. In other words, the decrease in the intensity of the absorption band is concomitant with the decrease in carrier concentration. The absorption band in the visible wavelength range was prominent for the GZO films deposited under O 2 -deficient conditions, and the intensity of the absorption band weakened as the O 2 gas flow rate increased. The post-deposition annealing also decreased the intensity of the absorption band. These observations correlated with a change in the carrier concentration. In Fig. 5 , the integral intensities of the absorption bands for photon energies between 1.8 and 2.8 eV are plotted versus the carrier concentration for all the GZO films studied here. We can see that the absorption intensity shows a good correlation with the carrier concentration regardless of the annealing atmosphere or deposition conditions. The intensity monotonously decreased with the decrease of the carrier concentration and diminished at a carrier concentration of around 7 × 10 20 cm − 3 . The decrease in carrier concentration that occurred as the O 2 flow rate increased and due to post-deposition annealing, which was accompanied by a decrease in the intensity of the optical absorption band in the visible wavelength region, may be related to native donors in GZO films, that is, oxygen vacancies or interstitial Zn. If we assume that not only carriers from doped Ga donors but also carriers from native donors contribute to transport in the GZO films, such native donors could be reduced by additional oxygen during deposition or by post-deposition annealing. Then the optical absorption band would disappear with the reduced density of defects in the GZO films. In the case of post-deposition annealing, these phenomena occurred up to the critical temperatures observed in the electrical properties of the GZO films shown in Fig. 3 , and the decrease of defects in GZO films occurred at lower temperatures in the air atmosphere than in the N 2 atmosphere. Beyond the critical temperature, other drastic changes, such as the segregation of Ga at the grain boundary [10] , resulted in the serious degradation in the electrical properties of the GZO films. 4 Summary The optical absorption spectra of GZO films deposited by ion plating with DC arc discharge have been studied. The GZO films deposited under oxygen-deficient deposition conditions showed prominent absorption bands in the visible wavelength range. The intensity of the absorption band decreased as the O 2 flow rate increased during deposition. The post-deposition annealing also reduced the intensity of the visible absorption band. The change of absorption intensity showed a correlation with carrier concentrations greater than 7 × 10 20 cm − 3 . The intensity decreased with the decrease of the carrier concentration and diminished at a carrier concentration of around 7 × 10 20 cm − 3 . We suggested the possibility of a partial contribution from native donors to the total carrier concentration in GZO films.

        "abstract": "We reviewed lifestyle factors that influence serum uric acid levels and risk of gout flare, and how to improve their deleterious effects. Since obesity increases uric acid and weight gain increases gout risk, weight reduction by daily exercise and limiting intake of excess calories is recommended. However, strenuous exercise, which causes adenine nucleotide degradation; starvation, which decreases uric acid excretion; and dehydration may raise the level of uric acid in serum and trigger gout. Increased intake of purine-rich foods, such as meat and seafood, raise the level of uric acid in serum and is associated with increased risk of gout, whereas dairy products, especially low-fat types, are associated with a lower risk of gout. Also, heavy alcohol drinking raises the uric acid level and increases the risk of gout through adenine nucleotide degradation and lactate production. Sweet fruits and soft drinks containing fructose should be moderated, since fructose may raise uric acid and increase gout risk through uric acid production and/or decreased excretion. On the other hand, the Mediterranean diet is recommended for gout patients, since it may also help prevent hyperuricemia. Furthermore, coffee and vitamin C supplementation could be considered as preventive measures, as those can lower serum uric acid levels as well as the risk of gout.",

Above all, the diffusion weighted image (DWI) is known as the tool which can diagnose acute ischemic stroke with high accuracy in a short time. DTI, an applied form of DWI, was devised as a technique to image the structure of the brain white matter. In clinical sites, this technique is used for pathologic elucidation such as the intracerebral tissue injury or mental disorder. Additionally, diffusion tensor tractography (DTT), which is a technique to build three-dimensional structure of the neural fiber tracts, is used for grasping the relations between a brain tumor and the fibers tract. Therefore, these techniques may be useful imaging tools in the central nerve region.",

The particle size and surface potential were monitored as concentration of V-501 used for the polymerization was varied. When the V-501 concentration was increased, the particle size increased because V-501 was a weak acid and reduced the surface potential, thereby promoting particle growth through coagulation. Additionally, V-501 can also function as a radical initiator, increasing the efficiency of the polymerization reaction and, thus, the number concentration of the particles.",

        "abstract": "The bit error rate (BER) performance of single-carrier transmissions degrades due to a severe inter-symbol interference (ISI) in a frequency-selective fading channel. However, it can be significantly improved by using frequency-domain equalization. Recently, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) spatial multiplexing is gaining much attention for achieving very high speed data communication. Various signal separation and detection schemes have been proposed for MIMO multiplexing. In this paper, it is pointed out that the frequency-domain received signal in single-carrier transmissions is similar to that of MIMO multiplexing, and the signal separation and detection schemes for MIMO multiplexing can be applied to the single-carrier detection. We evaluate, by computer simulation, the BER performance of single carrier transmissions using minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection and Vertical-bell laboratories layered space-time architecture (V-BLAST) detection.

        "abstract": "Background  Paragangliomas are generally benign, slow-growing tumors. However, approximately 10%–20% are malignant, characterized by distant metastasis. Recently, a germ line mutation in  succinate dehydrogenase B subunit  ( SDHB ) has been shown to be associated with malignant behavior in paraganglioma. Here we present a case of SDHB-negative malignant paraganglioma of the jugular foramen with a pseudohypoxic microenvironment and unique imaging features on [ 18 F]-fluoro-2-deoxy- d -glucose positron emission tomography ([ 18 F]-FDG PET), and discuss the significance of SDHB immunohistochemistry and the potential of [ 18 F]-FDG PET for clinical management.    Case Description  A 55-year-old woman was diagnosed with jugular foramen paraganglioma. Initial surgical resection was performed; however, follow-up [ 18 F]-FDG PET indicated multiple uptake regions throughout the body. Biopsies for multiple recurrent lesions revealed consistent pathological features, suggesting distant metastasis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a lack of SDHB immunostaining in all specimens. Pseudohypoxic markers, including hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and downstream glycolysis enzymes, were strongly expressed. [ 18 F]-FDG PET demonstrated increased uptake in the lesions, and the patient died 3 years after initial metastasis.    Conclusion  In patients with head and neck paraganglioma without SDHB expression, close follow-up should be considered because of the risk for metastasis. In such cases, [ 18 F]-FDG PET might be useful for detecting metastasis due to atypical accumulation from pseudohypoxia-induced glycolysis.",

        "abstract": "Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a transmembrane receptor that mediates immune responses to exogenous and endogenous ligands and interacts with heat shock proteins, which are reportedly involved in normal tension glaucoma (NTG). This study was undertaken to investigate whether TLR4 polymorphisms are associated with NTG.Two hundred fifty Japanese patients with NTG and 318 Japanese healthy control subjects were recruited. Eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TLR4 gene were genotyped, and allelic and phenotypic diversity was assessed between cases and control subjects.Strong linkage disequilibrium was observed among all SNPs (D' >or= 0.85), which were located in one haplotype block. With respect to allelic diversity, the minor allele of three SNPs (rs10759930, rs1927914, and rs7037117) carried a significantly increased risk of NTG. With regard to genotypic diversity, individuals with the minor allele of six SNPs (rs10759930, rs1927914, rs1927911, rs12377632, rs2149356, and rs7037117) had a 1.47- to 1.65-fold increased risk of NTG. rs7037117, located in the 3'-untranslated region of TLR4, was most strongly associated with NTG, and when incorporated into a haplotype with rs10759930, the strongest association was detected (P = 0.0038, P(c) = 0.0095).Multiple SNPs in the TLR4 gene are associated with the risk of NTG. This finding suggests that the ligands and/or cytokines involved in the TLR4 signaling network may be risk factors for the development of NTG.",

        "abstract": "Early detection of glaucoma is important to slow down progression of the disease and to prevent total vision loss. We have been studying an automated scheme for detection of a retinal nerve fiber layer defect (NFLD), which is one of the earliest signs of glaucoma on retinal fundus images. In our previous study, we proposed a multi-step detection scheme which consists of Gabor filtering, clustering and adaptive thresholding. The problems of the previous method were that the number of false positives (FPs) was still large and that the method included too many rules. In attempt to solve these problems, we investigated the end-to-end learning system without pre-specified features. A deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with deconvolutional layers was trained to detect NFLD regions. In this preliminary investigation, we investigated effective ways of preparing the input images and compared the detection results. The optimal result was then compared with the result obtained by the previous method. DCNN training was carried out using original images of abnormal cases, original images of both normal and abnormal cases, ellipse-based polar transformed images, and transformed half images. The result showed that use of both normal and abnormal cases increased the sensitivity as well as the number of FPs. Although NFLDs are visualized with the highest contrast in green plane, the use of color images provided higher sensitivity than the use of green image only. The free response receiver operating characteristic curve using the transformed color images, which was the best among seven different sets studied, was comparable to that of the previous method. Use of DCNN has a potential to improve the generalizability of automated detection method of NFLDs and may be useful in assisting glaucoma diagnosis on retinal fundus images.",

The patient was a 67-year-old man suffering from progressive bilateral visual acuity disturbance. Angiography revealed a diffuse arteriovenous fistula in the left transverse-sigmoid sinus affected by severe venous congestion. Visual acuity disturbance is likely to have been caused by increased intracranial pressure(IICP). Venous congestion as well as visual acuity were gradually improved following three transarterial embolizations. It is possible that a gradual progression of the clinical condition has caused only visual acuity disturbance without any other IICP symptoms, which is similar to pseudotumor cerebri. Should an unexplained visual acuity loss occur, the case should be investigated by considering DAVF.",

First, the surfaces of MWCNTs were modified by acids to increase their hydrophilicity, resulting in surface-active MWCNTs. Then, a Pickering emulsion was formed using liquid benzyl methacrylate monomer and the surface-active MWCNTs. The surface charge of the surface-active MWCNTs greatly influenced the surface coverage and size of the composite particles. Furthermore, when untreated MWCNTs were added to the monomer phase, surface coverage of the resulting particles was enhanced because MWCNTs on the surface of the particles interacted with MWCNTs incorporated inside the particles, thus preventing the surface-active MWCNTs on the surface from being released into the bulk. As a result, the mechanical properties of the composite polymer particles were successfully improved because the incorporated MWCNTs worked well as fillers.",

The incidence of peripheral anterior synechiae was 86.8% in the eyes with acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, 51.4% in their fellow eyes, and 83.3% in the eyes with chronic primary angle-closure glaucoma. The peripheral anterior synechiae in the eyes with acute primary angle-closure glaucoma were wider and taller than those found in the eyes with chronic primary angle-closure glaucoma. Wide peripheral anterior synechiae were most prevalent in the superior sector and were, overall, more prevalent than the narrow type. Peripheral anterior synechiae, as a whole, were most frequently seen in the superior sector. The wide peripheral anterior synechiae were taller than the narrow type. The age of the patient and the extent of the peripheral anterior synechiae (peripheral anterior synechiae index) showed no significant correlation. A significant correlation (r = 0.68, p < 0.01) was found between the duration of acute attacks and the peripheral anterior synechiae index.",

In subjects in whom NTG was definitely diagnosed based on the results of the 24-h monitoring, the average maximum, minimum, and mean IOP was 16.1, 11.7, and 13.9 mmHg, respectively, and the mean diurnal variation in IOP was 4.4 mmHg. The peak time was observed outside clinic hours (1800-0800) in 41.4% of patients, and the trough time was observed during clinic hours (1000-1600) in 15.9%. In 2.9% of NTG subjects, the diagnosis was eventually changed to POAG during follow-up.Assessment of diurnal variations of IOP in suspected NTG patients is useful for the differential diagnosis of POAG from NTG and for establishment of a baseline, which may affect the management plan.",

        "abstract": "We use a statistical thermodynamic model to theoretically predict the normal stress of a polymer gel, which is twisted by a rotational rheometer in the parallel plate geometry. This theory predicts that the normal stress of the gel is positive at a short time scale. At longer time, the normal stress decreases significantly due to the redistribution of solvent, but is still positive when the polymer network is in the neo-Hookean regime. The normal stress becomes negative when the polymer network is greatly prestretched in the swelling process because large tension is generated by shearing already prestretched polymers. Our theory predicts the phase diagram with respect to the direction of normal stress as functions of the aspect ratio and swelling ratio of gels. Experimental tests on this prediction may advance our understanding of the physical mechanisms involved in the negative normal stress generated by polymer gels.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The recent status of Japanu0027s government-driven project to establish carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic composites (CFRTP) technology for automotive applications conducted in the National Composites Center (NCC) Japan is introduced first. The baseline technology is discontinuous carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic composites (C-LFT-D: carbon – long fiber thermoplastic-direct) using press compaction. All the components of the target car chassis made of aluminum alloy are replaced by C-LFT-D components and a 10% weight reduction with the same rigidity has been verified. The basic physics of the fiber length distribution mechanism and the experimental procedures to measure fiber length distributions are proposed. A basic theory to predict the flow behavior of extruded raw material of the mixture of melted resin and thermoplastics is proposed, and sophisticated CAE software to predict the flow patterns of the raw material is established. Measured elastic moduli of processed LFT-D plates show strong dependency on local fiber orientations and strong correlations between bending strengths and bending modulus are found. Hence, prediction of fiber orientation in the press compaction is a key point of the design of LFT-D components. The viscoelastic properties of C-LFT-D materials are characterized by using established theories. Certain important parameters, such as the shift factors, are identified by theory and experiments. The basic concepts of joining technology are also established, where ultrasonic fusion bonding is selected as the primary method. Joining procedures are defined and mechanical properties of the joints are evaluated. The essence of the other project conducted in the University of Tokyo for CFRTP applications to automobiles is also introduced. Several new composites are developed and evaluation technologies are developed.",

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common type of malignant brain tumor and has a very poor prognosis. Most patients relapse within 12 months despite aggressive treatment and patient outcome after recurrent is extremely worse. This study was designed to clarify the change of the molecular expression, including programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1), on the initial and secondary resected tumor specimens and to address the influence of these expressions for patient outcome after second surgery of glioblastoma. We investigated 16 patients, ranging in age from 14 to 65 years, with histologically verified WHO grade IV GBM, whose original tumor was resected between 2008 and 2014, and treated with fractionated radiotherapy and temozolomide. Four patients who were treated with immunotherapy using autologous formalin-fixed tumor vaccine were enrolled. All of the patients underwent secondary resection after tumor recurrence within 24 months. We carried out an immunohistochemical examination of the initial and secondary resected tumors from patients using a panel of immune system molecular markers, and assessed whether marker expression correlated with clinical outcomes. CD3, CD8 and PD-1 on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was significantly increased in secondary resected specimens compared with initially resected specimens (p ≤ 0.05). All patients expressed PD-L1 on tumor cells in initial and secondary resection specimens. Patients were divided into high or low expression group by median IHC score of PD-1 on initial or secondary resected specimens. No significant differences in patient outcomes were observed between high and low PD-1 or PD-L1 groups of initially resected specimens. In high expression group of secondary resected specimens, most patients score had increased which compared with initial resected tumor specimens. The PD-1 high expression score group of secondary resected specimens was associated with long progression-free survival and short survival after recurrence. PD-L1 expression was detected in almost all initial and secondary specimens. Patients with high PD-1 expression of secondary specimen had bad prognosis after secondary resection. PD-1/PD-L1 pathway may be associated with patient outcome after second surgery of glioblastoma.",

Microwave heating could reduce the treatment time necessary for the completion of the solid-phase reaction by 1/30. This decrease was attributed to an increase in the diffusion rate of Sn at the local heat spot in the indium oxide formed by microwave irradiation. However, microwave heating also decreased the amount of ITO produced, since the powder layer of the raw material was heated unevenly and had an uneven temperature distribution. Therefore, a microwave heating method including a mixing process was proposed in order to diminish the uneven progress of the ITO synthesis reaction in the powder layer. This revised method could increase the conversion to ITO, which is higher than that obtained by using the conventional heating method. Hence, the electric conductivity of the powder layer obtained by the proposed method was higher than that of the commercially supplied ITO powder layer.",

        "abstract": "Suwabe et al. (1) composed a well-written and interesting study examining the relationship between mild exercise and hippocampal memory function. It is interesting that the neurobiological mechanisms responsible for the effects of exercise are systematically investigated. A prominent finding was that a short bout (10 min) of mild exercise increased activity, specifically in hippocampal subregions and in the entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices. This can be understood as a neurobiological mechanism that has contributed to exercise-induced cognitive benefits. We concur with Suwabe et al. (1), although we can identify one main problem in this study pointing to the intensity of exercise, which moderates the magnitude of the exercise-induced effect … [↵][1]1To whom correspondence should be addressed.

In addition, the interaction between the carbon fiber coated with particles to the PMMA resin would be improved, and the surface adhesion between them was strengthened.",

All eyes were examined before surgical or laser intervention and had normal pupillary reaction without any topical drugs. Four predetermined angle locations per eye were examined. Parameters regarding the chamber angle configuration were measured and compared between the two groups.Appositional angle closures were observed in 27 locations in fellow eyes and in 48 locations in normotensive eyes with a closure-possible narrow angle. The incidence was statistically different between the two groups (69.2% in the fellow eyes and 48% in the normotensive eyes). Appositional angle closures beginning at the entrance of the angle were more frequently detected in the fellow eye group. The distance between the iris root and the bottom of the angle was significantly different between the two groups.The fellow eyes of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma have different topologic features from normotensive narrow-angled eyes and a higher incidence of appositional closure that may predispose these eyes to an imminent acute attack.",

We propose the use of very thin  critical layers  ( CLs ) made from Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) films deposited by ion plating with direct-current arc discharge, which strongly affect the orientation of AZO films deposited by direct-current magnetron sputtering. The Al 2 O 3  content in the sputtering target was 0.5 wt.%. 500-, 200- and 100-nm-thick AZO films with  CLs  exhibited high-Hall-mobility values of 50.1 cm 2 /Vs, 40.2 cm 2 /Vs and 32.5 cm 2 /Vs, respectively, compared with those of  CL -free AZO films. The presence of  CLs  with a preferential  c -axis orientation as interfaces between AZO films and glass substrates plays a critical role in producing AZO films having a textured polycrystalline structure with a well-defined (0001) orientation.",

Of these, 27 eyes had optic disk hemorrhages in their clinical courses. Pointwise linear regression analysis was done using total deviation values of the fields at each of 74 test locations in each patient. Progression was defined as the points of negative slopes with P <.01. A whole visual field was concentrically divided into three clusters: the areas within 10 degrees, 10 to 20 degrees, and 20 to 30 degrees. Percentages of the progressed points of the three clusters and a whole field were compared between the groups with and without optic disk hemorrhages.No significant differences were found in patients' backgrounds, including initial mean deviation values, follow-up periods, and the number of visual field examinations between the 27 patients with optic disk hemorrhages and the 31 without. The group with optic disk hemorrhages showed significantly higher percentages of progressed points within the 10-degree area compared with the group without optic disk hemorrhages (mean +/- SD: 13.1 +/- 13.7%; 5.1 +/- 8.5%, respectively; P =.0086, Student t test), whereas no significant differences were found in the other two clusters or in a whole field.Patients with NTG with optic disk hemorrhages tend to show visual field progression in areas within 10 degrees.",

METHODS: This was a prospective study conducted at Gifu University Hospital of 50 eyes of 50 patients with normal-tension glaucoma (12 men, 38 women; age, 56.5 ± 14.1 years) who had developed new disk hemorrhage at the time of enrollment and 58 eyes of 58 patients with normal-tension glaucoma (20 men, 38 women; age, 56.7 ± 12.4 years) with no history of disk hemorrhage during the follow-up period of more than 2 years. Age and global indexes of the visual field were matched. We morphometrically compared the optic disk with and without hemorrhage using a scanning laser tomograph. Global and sector analyses were made of the optic disk structural parameters. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the global values of the disk parameters between the disk hemorrhage and the nonhemorrhage groups. However, the inferotemporal values for the rim area, rim volume, mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, and retinal nerve fiber layer cross-section area in the disk hemorrhage group were significantly smaller than those in the nonhemorrhage group ( P < .05). In the disk hemorrhage group, moreover, the values for the rim area, rim volume, and retinal nerve fiber layer cross-section area in the inferotemporal sector with hemorrhage were significantly smaller than those in the same sector without hemorrhage ( P < .05). CONCLUSION: Localized damage of the disk rim and retinal nerve fiber layer at the inferotemporal sector was prominent in eyes with disk hemorrhage.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a 2-step frequency-domain channel estimation scheme suitable for training sequence inserted single-carrier (TS-SC) block transmission using frequency-domain equalization (FDE). In the first step, the received training sequence having cyclic property is constructed for frequency-domain channel estimation to obtain the instantaneous channel estimate. Improved channel estimate is obtained by simply averaging the instantaneous channel estimates over several blocks. In the second step, the maximum likelihood channel estimation is carried out iteratively by using both the estimated symbol sequence and the training sequence. The BER performance with the proposed frequency-domain channel estimation scheme is evaluated by computer simulation. It is shown that the proposed channel estimation scheme achieves a BER performance close to the perfect channel estimation.",

        "abstract": "To compare intraocular pressure (IOP) measured by a Goldmann applanation tonometer (GAT), a noncontact tonometer (NCT), and a portable noncontact tonometer (PNCT) in eyes of healthy volunteers, and to determine if a significant correlation exists between the IOP and the central corneal thickness (CCT).A total of 144 healthy participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups; in the first group, IOP was measured first with the NCT and then with the GAT. In the second group, IOP was measured first with the PNCT and then with the GAT. Subsequently, the CCT of all subjects was measured with an ultrasonic pachymeter.The IOPs determined by the GAT and NCT and were strongly correlated, as were those determined by the GAT and PNCT, in both groups. However, a Bland-Altman plot showed that the correlations between the GAT and NCT and between the GAT and the PNCT measurements were not significant. With all three instruments, the IOP readings varied with the CCT. The mean IOPs obtained with the GAT increased by 0.23 mmHg with each 10-microm increase in CCT (0.23 mmHg/10 microm). The comparable value for the NCT was 0.29 mmHg/10 microm, and that for the PNCT was 0.31 mmHg/10 microm.For measurements of IOP in normal eyes, the GAT is the tonometer least affected by the CCT, compared with the PNCT and NCT. A PNCT is more likely to be affected by variations in CCT than the GAT.",

        "abstract": "The coal fly ash was treated hydrothermally with the mixture of NaOH aqueous solution and NaCl aqueous solution at 373 K, using the microwave heating and the conventional heating in order to clarify influences of the NaCl concentration in the hydrothermal solution on the growth rate and the crystalline phase of synthesized zeolites. As a result, it was found that phillipsite crystallinity of product powder increases with the additive NaCl concentration in the hydrothermal solution when the concentration of NaOH is so low as not to generate the zeolite from fly ash. On the other hand, in case that NaOH concentration is relatively high, the addition of NaCl to the hydrothermal solution using the conventional heating hardly affects phillipsite crystallinity of product powder; however, the generation of hydroxysodalite is enhanced by the microwave heating. Moreover, it was revealed that the necessary treatment time to complete the crystallization of phillipsite increases with increasing concentration of NaCl in the hydrothermal solution. This is because the substitution of NaCl for NaOH reduces the dissolution rate of aluminate and silicate ions from fly ash and the generation rate of the precursor aluminosilicate gel. However, this delay of the completion of the crystallization can be shortened by the microwave heating method. These experimental results concluded that the utilization of NaCl for the hydrothermal solution is effective in phillipsite synthesis from fly ash only when the NaOH concentration is relatively low in the hydrothermal solution and especially, when the microwave heating is used.",

        "abstract": "Histone methylation/demethylation plays an important modulatory role in chromatin restructuring, RNA transcription and is essential for controlling a plethora of biological processes. Due to many human diseases have been related to histone methylation/demethylation, several compounds such as 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep) or 3-((6-(4,5-Dihydro-1H-benzo[d]azepin-3(2H)-yl)-2-(pyridin-2-yl)pyrimidin-4-yl)amino)propanoic acid; -[2-(2-pyridinyl)-6-(1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-3H-3-benzazepin-3-yl)-4-pyrimidinyl]-β-Alanine (GSK-J1), have been designed to inhibit histone methylase or suppress histone demethylase, respectively. In the present study, we investigated the effects on the sleep-wake cycle and sleep-related neurochemical levels after systemic injections of DZNep or GSK-J1 given during the light or dark phase in rats. DZNep dose-dependently (0.1, 1.0, or 10 mg/kg, i.p.) prolonged wakefulness (W) duration while decreased slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) time spent during the lights-on period with no changes observed in dark phase. In opposite direction, GSK-J1 (0.1, 1.0, or 10 mg/kg, i.p.) injected at the beginning of the lights-on period induced no statistical changes in W, SWS, or REMS whereas if administered at darkness, we found a diminution in W and an enhancement in SWS and REMS. Finally, brain microdialysis experiments in freely moving animals were used to evaluate the effects of DZNep or GSK-J1 treatments on contents of sleep-related neurochemicals. The results showed that DZNep boosted extracellular levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin, adenosine, and acetylcholine if injected at the beginning of the lights-on period whereas GSK-J1 exerted similar outcomes but when administered at darkness. In summary, DZNep and GSK-J1 may control the sleep-wake cycle and sleep-related neurochemicals through histone methylation/demethylation activity.",

        "abstract": "To determine whether multifocal electroretinograms (mfERGs) can provide an index for identification of glaucomatous optic neuropathy in patients with normal-tension glaucoma (NTG).mfERGs were recorded in 30 normal volunteers (30 eyes) and 20 patients (20 eyes) with normal-tension glaucoma (NTG). Visual field examinations were performed with a Humphrey field analyzer, and all NTG patients had unilateral hemifield defects. The mfERGs were elicited by a binary m-sequence of flashes from 37 hexagonal elements that subtended an overall visual angle of 50 degrees x 40 degrees. The mfERGs were summed and analyzed for predetermined retinal loci. These mfERGs were compared with the perimetric findings of the corresponding visual fields.In normal volunteers, the amplitude of the second-order kernel within the central 5 degrees of the nasal hemisphere was significantly smaller than in that of the temporal hemisphere (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P = 0.0001). In NTG patients, this asymmetry of the two hemispheres was reduced or not present. The ratio of the amplitude of the mfERGs from the nasal and temporal hemispheres (N/T amplitude ratio) in normal control volunteers was significantly different from that of NTG patients with a hemifield defect (analysis of variance, P = 0.0001). When the cutoff value for the N/T amplitude ratio was set at 0.83 for discriminating glaucomatous eyes from normal eyes, the sensitivity was 65.0% with a specificity of 96.7%. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of the N/T amplitude ratio was 0.86. The N/T amplitude ratio and the visual field indices were significantly correlated.A decrease in the nasal-temporal asymmetry in the amplitude of the second-order kernel responses within the central 5 degrees of glaucoma patients' eyes indicated a dysfunction of the inner retinal layers, including of the retinal ganglion cells.",

In this study, we examined the involvement of the nuclear isoform of TC-PTP in interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated signaling pathway. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that plays important roles in the immune system, hematopoiesis, and acute phase reactions, and has also implicated in IL-6-related diseases. Here, we demonstrate that IL-6-induced tyrosine-phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 were suppressed by overexpression of the nuclear isoform of TC-PTP in 293T cells. Tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 directly interacted with a substrate-trapping mutant of TC-PTP. Furthermore, retrovirus-mediated overexpression of the nuclear isoform of TC-PTP suppressed the IL-6-induced growth arrest of myeloid leukemia M1 cells. Endogenous TC-PTP complexed with STAT3 in the nucleus of M1 cells. These results strongly suggest that the nuclear isoform of TC-PTP may serve as a negative regulator of IL-6-mediated signaling pathway.",

The electric conductivity of the crystallized hydrogel from them was compared with that from calcium carbonate reagent. It was found that the conductivity of the hydrogel from bone powder is almost equal to that from calcium carbonate reagent, which is higher than that from incineration fly ash. Because the crystallized hydrogel from incineration ash has a lower crystallinity than that from bone powder and calcium carbonate reagent. However, the difference of the conductivity among them can be hardly observed above 100 degrees C. The fuel cell with membrane electrode assembly (MEA) using the calcium phosphate hydrogel membrane prepared from incineration fly ash and bone powder was observed to generate electricity. The performance of fuel cells having the hydrogel membrane obtained from all raw materials increases with the cell temperature, and the fuel cell containing the hydrogel membrane from incineration fly ash has the highest dependence of the fuel cell performance. For this reason, the difference in the cell performance among them can be hardly observed above 120 degrees C. This tendency agrees with the change in the electric conductivity with the temperature. Further, the performance of all fuel cells with the hydrogel membrane is superior to that of the fuel cell with perfluorosulfonic polymer membrane at temperatures greater than approximately 85 degrees C.",

The recently discovered protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3) binds directly to STAT3 and blocks transcriptional activation. In our previous report, we demonstrated that PIAS3 directly interacted with androgen receptor (AR) and affected AR-mediated gene activation. Furthermore, we also showed that AR associated with STAT3 and enhanced its activity. Here, we examined molecular interactions between STAT3, PIAS3, and AR to underline the mechanism of how they regulate each other. AR activation overcame the inhibitory effect on STAT3-mediated transcription by PIAS3. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that an active form of AR relieved STAT3 from STAT3-PIAS3 complex formation. These results indicate that AR and PIAS3 regulate the STAT3-mediated transcriptional activity by their physical protein-protein competition on STAT3.",

She had received a topical antimicrobial agent because of bleb leak before presentation. She underwent anterior chamber tap and complete vitrectomy with intravitreal antibiotics. Cultures from the vitreous aspirate grew gram-positive cocci. The DNA from the microorganism was sequenced and identified as S. intermedius. Three months after the surgical intervention, her right eye showed no residual inflammation with a best-corrected visual acuity of 30/200.Bleb-associated endophthalmitis caused by S. intermedius is responsive to intravitreal antibiotics and vitrectomy, and special care should be taken to identify a bacterial pathogen.",

        "abstract": "Currently, nipradilol, an alpha-1 beta-blocker with a nitric oxide donative action, is used as an ocular hypotensive agent for glaucoma patients in Japan. The aim of the present study was to investigate the neuroprotective effect of nipradilol on optic nerve injury in rats.Using a calibrated cross-action forceps, a crush lesion was inflicted unilaterally on the optic nerve 2 mm behind the globe of adult Wistar albino rats and followed by topical instillation of either 0.25% nipradilol or the vehicle in both eyes twice daily until killing. A sham operation was conducted on the contralateral eye. Intraocular pressure measurement was performed 3 days before and 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after acute injury of the optic nerve. One week before killing, Fluoro-Gold was injected into the bilateral superior colliculi to identify surviving retinal ganglion cells (RGCs).Twenty-eight days after injury, retinal damage was assessed morphologically. There was no significant difference in the intraocular pressure of both eyes between the nipradilol and control groups. Within 1 month, the mean RGC density in the vehicle-treated group had decreased to 71.58+/-0.102% of that of the contralateral eye, whereas the optic nerve crush with topical application of nipradilol showed a considerably smaller decrease to 89.60+/-0.027% (P<0.001). No significant morphologic difference between sham-operated animals and animals from the experimental groups was observed in the retinal layers owing to the crush force.Our findings might indicate that nipradilol can alleviate RGC death induced by optic nerve crush injury in the rat.",

We show that SLP-76 and BLNK, but not LAT, effectively co-operated with Syk and Tec family PTKs to activate NF-AT and NF-kappaB. We also show that Tec family PTKs enhanced endogenous phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma1 phosphorylation induced by CD8/zeta and Syk in 293T cells. These results imply that PLC-gamma1 may play a critical role in a hematopoietic cell-specific adapter protein-mediated NF-AT and NF-kappaB activation in a non-lymphoid cell.",

        "title": "Evaluation of the extent of resection and detection of ischemic lesions with intraoperative MRI in glioma surgery: is intraoperative MRI superior to early postoperative MRI?",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE MRI scans obtained within 48-72 hours (early postoperative MRI [epMRI]), prior to any postoperative reactive changes, are recommended for the accurate assessment of the extent of resection (EOR) after glioma surgery. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) enables ischemic lesions to be detected and distinguished from the residual tumor. Prior studies, however, revealed that postoperative reactive changes were often present, even in epMRI. Although intraoperative MRI (iMRI) is widely used to maximize safe resection during glioma surgery, it is unclear whether iMRI is superior to epMRI when evaluating the EOR, because it theoretically shows fewer postoperative reactive changes. In addition, the ability to detect ischemic lesions using iMRI has not been investigated. METHODS The authors retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data in 30 patients with glioma (22 and 8 patients with enhancing and nonenhancing lesions, respectively) who underwent tumor resection. These patients had received preoperative MRI within 24 hours prior to surgery, postresection radiological evaluation with iMRI during surgery, and epMRI within 24 hours after surgery, with all neuroimaging performed using identical 1.5T MRI scanners. The authors compared iMRI or epMRI with preoperative MRI, and defined a postoperative reactive change as a new postoperative enhancement or T2 high-intensity area (HIA), if this lesion was outside of the preoperative original tumor location. In addition, postoperative ischemia was evaluated on DWI. The iMRI and epMRI findings were compared in terms of 1) postoperative reactive changes, 2) evaluation of the EOR, and 3) presence of ischemic lesion on DWI. RESULTS In patients with enhancing lesions, a new enhancement was seen in 8 of 22 patients (36.4%) on iMRI and in 12 of 22 patients (54.5%) on epMRI. In patients with nonenhancing lesions, a new T2 HIA was seen in 4 of 8 patients (50.0%) on iMRI and in 7 of 8 patients (87.5%) on epMRI. A discrepancy between the EOR measured on iMRI and epMRI was noted in 5 of the 22 patients (22.7%) with enhancing lesions, and in 3 of the 8 patients (37.5%) with nonenhancing lesions. The occurrence of ischemic lesions on DWI was found in 5 of 30 patients (16.7%) on iMRI, whereas it was found in 16 of 30 patients (53.3%) on epMRI (p = 0.003); ischemic lesions were underestimated on iMRI in 11 patients. CONCLUSIONS Overall, given the lower incidence of postoperative reactive changes on iMRI, it was superior to epMRI in evaluating the EOR in patients with glioma, both with enhancing and nonenhancing lesions. However, because ischemic lesions can be overlooked on iMRI, the authors recommend only the additional DWI scan during the early postoperative period. Clinicians need to be mindful about not overestimating the presence of residual tumor on epMRI due to the high incidence of postoperative reactive changes.",

        "abstract": "Daxx has been reported to mediate the Fas/JNK-dependent signals in the cytoplasm. However, several evidences have suggested that Daxx is located mainly in the nucleus and functions as a transcriptional regulator. Recently, we identified DMAP1, a TSG101-interacting protein as a Daxx binding partner by yeast two-hybrid screening. TSG101 has been shown to act as transcriptional co-repressor of nuclear hormone receptors. Here we examined whether TSG101also interacts with Daxx directly. The association of Daxx and TSG101 was confirmed using co-expressed tagged proteins. The interaction regions in both proteins were also mapped, and the cellular localization of the interaction was examined. TSG101 formed a complex with Daxx through its coiled-coil domain and co-localized in the nucleus. Furthermore, TSG101 enhanced Daxx-mediated repression of glucocorticoid receptor transcriptional activity. These results provide the novel molecular interactions between Daxx and TSG101, which establish an efficient repressive transcription complex in the nucleus.",

STAT3 has also been demonstrated to mediate cellular transformation and is found in numerous cancers. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are a diverse group of chemicals that bind to estrogen receptors (ERs), mimic estrogenic actions, and may have adverse effects on human health. In our previous study, we demonstrated that estrogens suppressed the STAT3-mediated transcription activity through ERs. In this study, we examined the effects of EDCs on STAT3-mediated signaling through ERs. Surprisingly, some of EDCs enhanced STAT3-mediated transcription activity through ERs. This finding strongly suggests that EDCs may play an important role in the endocrine functions by mimicking cytokine activity by stimulating STAT3 actions through ERs.",

        "abstract": "QR decomposition and M-algorithm based near maximum likelihood block detection (QRM-MLBD) significantly improves the single-carrier (SC) multiple-input multiple-output (SC-MIMO) transmission performance in a frequency-selective fading channel. In the conventional QRM-MLBD, the cyclic prefix (CP) is inserted in order to avoid the inter-block interference (IBI). However, CP insertion reduces the transmission efficiency. In this paper, an iterative overlap QRM-MLBD is proposed for SC-MIMO transmission with no CP insertion. It is confirmed by computer simulation that the iterative overlap QRM-MLBD with no CP insertion provides improved throughput performance while reducing the computational complexity over the conventional QRM-MLBD with CP insertion.",

IL-6 also regulates the growth of various types of human malignant tumors. Here we demonstrate that IL-6-induced gene expression was suppressed by a specific heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor, geldanamycin (GA) in human hepatoma Hep3B cells. GA also suppressed the IL-6-induced activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in a human embryonic kidney carcinoma 293T cells. This inhibitory effect of GA on STAT3 activation was reversed by overexpression of Hsp90. Furthermore, Hsp90 directly bound to STAT3 via its N-terminal region, which interacted with GA. We provide evidence that the action of GA on IL-6 functions was due to the inhibition of direct physical interactions between STAT3 and Hsp90, which represents a novel role of Hsp90 in the IL-6 signaling pathways.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  A regional-scale meteorology – chemistry model (NHM-Chem v1.0) has been developed. Three options for aerosol representations are currently available: the 5-category non-equilibrium (Aitken, soot-free accumulation, accumulation internally mixed with soot, dust, and sea-salt), 3-category non-equilibrium (Aitken, accumulation, and coarse), and bulk equilibrium (submicron, dust, and sea-salt) methods. These three methods are suitable for the predictions of regional climate, air quality, and operational forecasts, respectively. The total CPU times of the 5-category and 3-category methods were 91 % and 44 % greater than that of the bulk method, respectively. The bulk equilibrium method was shown to be eligible for operational forecast purposes, namely, the surface mass concentrations of air pollutants such as O 3 , mineral dust, and PM 2.5 . The 3-category method was shown to be eligible for air quality simulations, namely, mass concentrations and depositions. However, the internal mixture assumption of soot/soot-free and dust/sea-salt particles in the 3-category method resulted in significant differences in the size distribution and hygroscopicity of the particles. Even though the 3-category method was not designed to simulate aerosol-cloud-radiation interaction processes, its performance in terms of bulk properties, such as aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), was acceptable. However, some specific parameters exhibited significant differences or systematic errors. The unrealistic dust/sea-salt complete mixture of the 3-category method induced significant errors in the prediction of mineral dust containing CCN. The overestimation of soot hygroscopicity by the 3-category method induced errors in BC-containing CCN, BC deposition, and absorbing AOT (AAOT). The difference in AAOT was less pronounced because the overestimation of the absorption enhancement was compensated by the overestimation of hygroscopic growth and the consequent loss due to in-cloud scavenging.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Retinal nerve fiber layer defect (NFLD) is one of the most important findings for the diagnosis of glaucoma reported by ophthalmologists. However, such changes could be overlooked, especially in mass screenings, because ophthalmologists have limited  time  to  search  for  a  number  of  different  changes  for  the  diagnosis  of  various  diseases  such  as  diabetes,  hypertension and glaucoma. Therefore, the use of a computer-aided detection (CAD) system can improve the results of diagnosis. In  this  work,  a  technique  for  the  detection  of  NFLDs  in  retinal  fundus  images  is  proposed.  In  the  preprocessing step, blood vessels are \"erased\" from the original retinal fundus image by using morphological filtering. The preprocessed image is then transformed into a rectangular array. NFLD regions are observed as vertical dark bands inthe transformed  image.  Gabor  filtering  is  then  applied  to  enhance ,the  vertical  dark  bands. False positives (FPs) are reduced by a rule-based method,which uses the information of the location and the width ofeach candidate region. The detected regions are back-transformed into the original configuration. In this preliminary study, 71% of NFLD regions are detected  with  average  number  of  FPs  of  3.2  per  image.  In  conclusion,  we  have  developed  a  technique  for  the  detection of NFLDs in retinal fundus images. Promising results have been obtained in this initial study.

        "abstract": "Massive machine-type communications (mMTC) scenarios that can accommodate Internet of things (IoT) device communications are currently being considered for implementation in fifth generation mobile communication systems. To support the dynamic traffic present in mMTC systems, grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access schemes have been proposed. In these schemes, both system capacity enhancement and transmit protocol simplification are achieved, and an overloaded transmission of more than one hundred percent of the capacity of the number of transmit samples is conducted. However, demand still exists for more capacity to accommodate massive devices. On the other hand, a simple method for ensuring the security of mMTC systems is required to suppress the energy consumption of IoT devices and reduce the amount of signal processing required at the central receive stations. In this paper, to satisfy these requirements, we propose a novel grant-free sparse chaos code multiple access (GF-SCCMA) scheme for mMTC systems in which sparse code multiple access is supplied based on chaos signals and physical layer security is ensured. GF-SCCMA is a non-orthogonal multiple access scheme in which only pairs sharing common keys can decode data by utilizing a chaotic codebook of transmission sequences. Furthermore, the distribution of the output log likelihood ratio is improved by using chaos-based quasi-Gaussian modulation, and enhancement of the capacity is achieved for conventional schemes when the outer channel code is concatenated. The improved performances in terms of capacity and security are shown through numerical simulations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To evaluate the influence of low molecular weight polymers synthesized through soap-free emulsion polymerization on the indicator microorganism,  Micrococcus luteus , methyl methacrylate (MMA) and styrene were polymerized by using various initiators. The MMA polymer colloid was not toxic to  M. luteus . High volumes of polystyrene were continuously synthesized, and low-molecular weight polystyrenes were removed from the suspension to the supernatant. During the bioassay test, as the molecular weight of the cationic polystyrene in the supernatant decreased, the inhibition zone against  M. luteus  grew larger. Low molecular weight cationic polystyrene was toxic to  M. luteus . Hence, the supernatant containing low molecular weight cationic polystyrenes (particularly those with molecular weights below 1000 g/mol) obtained from soap-free emulsion polymerization should be treated carefully prior to its discharge to the environment. Moreover, such supernatants should be treated with more care if they are to be discharged into seas or rivers. One solution to reduce the toxicity of the supernatant against  M. luteus  is the addition of  N -vinylacetamide monomers during polymerization.",

        "abstract": "Retinal photoreceptor cell degeneration was induced by cobalt chloride, a chemical hypoxia-mimicking agent in rodents. Time course and dose-response of photoreceptor cell degeneration in mouse retina after intravitreal injection of cobalt chloride were examined by conventional histological analysis by hematoxylin and eosin staining and in situ terminal dUTP-biotin nick end labeling of DNA fragments (TUNEL) method with the use of paraffin-embedded sections. The dose-response of photoreceptor cell degeneration in rat retina was also examined. Photoreceptor cells progressively degenerated with time and under dose-response relationship. The suitable dose of cobalt chloride for the selective photoreceptor cell degeneration in mice is 10-12 nmol intravitreal injection at the volume of 2 microl. The retinal morphology of the mice 2 weeks after the 10-12 nmol intravitreal injection was similar to that of retinal degeneration in the mutant rd mouse. Retinal damage of total retinal layers was induced by an excessive dose of cobalt chloride. The progression of retinal damage after cobalt chloride injection, measured morphologically, was completed at 1 week. However, nuclear DNA fragmentation, mainly detected at outer nuclear layer by TUNEL, peaked at 48 h after 12 nmol cobalt chloride injection. Thus, the selective photoreceptor cell degeneration induced by cobalt chloride follows DNA fragmentation at outer nuclear layer. The photoreceptor cell degeneration is established optionally by cobalt chloride without use of the retinal degeneration mutant animals. Thus, we have described the development of a new model of retinal photoreceptor cell degeneration induced by a chemical hypoxia-mimicking agent.",

        "title": "Clinical significance of conformity index and gradient index in patients undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery for a single metastatic tumor.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVEAlthough the conformity index (CI) and the gradient index (GI), which were proposed by Paddick and colleagues, are both logically considered to correlate with good posttreatment results after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), this hypothesis has not been confirmed clinically. The authors' aim was to reappraise whether high CI values correlate with reduced tumor progression rates, and whether low GI values correlate with reduced complication incidences.METHODSThis was an institutional review board-approved, retrospective cohort study conducted using a prospectively accumulated database including 3271 patients who underwent Gamma Knife SRS for brain metastases (BMs) during the 1998-2016 period. Among the 3271 patients, 925 with a single BM at the time of SRS (335 women and 590 men, mean age 66 [range 24-93] years) were studied. The mean/median CIs were 0.62/0.66 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.53-0.74, range 0.08-0.88) and the mean/median GIs were 3.20/3.09 (IQR 2.83-3.39, range 2.27-11.4).RESULTSSRS-related complications occurred in 38 patients (4.1%), with a median post-SRS interval of 11.5 (IQR 6.0-25.8, maximum 118.0) months. Cumulative incidences of post-SRS complications determined by a competing risk analysis were 2.2%, 3.2%, 3.6%, 3.8%, and 3.9% at the 12th, 24th, 36th, 48th, and 60th post-SRS month, respectively. Multivariable analyses showed that only two clinical factors (i.e., peripheral doses and brain volume receiving ≥ 12 Gy) correlated with complication rates. However, neither CIs nor GIs impacted the incidences of complications. Among the 925 patients, post-SRS MRI was performed at least once in 716 of them, who were thus eligible for local progression evaluation. Among these 716 patients, local progression was confirmed in 96 (13.4%), with a median post-SRS interval of 10.8 (IQR 6.7-19.5, maximum 59.8) months. Cumulative incidences of local progression determined by a competing risk analysis were 7.7%, 12.6%, 14.2%, 14.8%, and 15.3% at the 12th, 24th, 36th, 48th, and 60th post-SRS month, respectively. Multivariable analyses showed neurological symptoms, extracerebral metastases, repeat SRS, and CIs to correlate with incidences of local progression, whereas GIs had no impact on local tumor progression. Particularly, cumulative incidences of local progression were significantly lower in patients with CIs < 0.65 than in those with CIs ≥ 0.65 (adjusted hazard ratio 1.870, 95% confidence interval 1.299-2.843; p = 0.0034).CONCLUSIONSTo the authors' knowledge, this is the first analysis to focus on the clinical significance of CI and GI based on a large series of patients with BM. Contrary to the majority opinion that dose planning with higher CI and lower GI results in good post-SRS outcomes (i.e., low local progression rates and minimal complications), this study clearly showed that the lower the CIs were, the lower the local progression rates were, and that the GI did not impact complication rates.",

After partial removal, the remaining tumor showed rapid enlargement, and the pathologic diagnosis at the second surgery revealed histopathologic features similar to those found in the initial samples, including biphasic patterns of neurocytic rosettes and GFAP-stained astrocytic components. These tumor cells had mildly atypical nuclei; however, mitotic figures and necrosis were absent. Eosinophilic granular bodies and a glomeruloid vasculature were found, but Rosenthal fibers were absent. The Ki-67 proliferative index was 3.5 % (vs 1.1 % at the initial surgery). No recurrence was recorded during the 3-year period after the proton radiotherapy. ",

        "abstract": "We use the two-fluid model to theoretically predict the relaxation dynamics of the normal stress of a gel, which is twisted by a rotational rheometer in the parallel plate geometry. We derive the equations of motion of solvent and polymer network by using an expansion of the free energy of the statistical thermodynamic model of polymer gels by the leading order nonlinear terms and solve these equations in the spirit of the lubrication approximation. Our theory predicts that the normal stress of the gel decreases exponentially with time due to the redistribution of solvent. The time scale of the normal stress relaxation scales with the square of the distance between the plates because the solvent redistribution results in the parabolic distribution of network displacements between the plates.",

The ZnO films grown using DMeZn showed higher electrical resistivity compared to that grown using DEtZn.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Core level (CL) and valence band (VB) spectra of heavily Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) films with carrier concentrations ( N e  ) ranging from 1.8 × 10 20  to 1.0 × 10 21  cm −3  were measured by high-resolution Al  K α   ( h ν  = 1486.6 eV) x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Cr  K α   ( h ν  = 5414.7 eV) hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES). The CL spectra of the GZO films measured by XPS had little dependence on  N e  . In contrast, clear differences in asymmetric broadening were observed in the HAXPES spectra owing to the large probing depth. The asymmetry in the Zn 2 p  3/2  and O 1 s  HAXPES spectra is mainly attributed to the energy loss of the conduction electron plasmon caused by the high  N e   of the GZO films. Similar asymmetry was also observed in the VB spectra of these GZO films. It was found that such asymmetry plays a crucial role in the determination of crystal polarity. With increasing  N e  , the intensity of the sub-peak at a binding energy  E b   of about 5 eV in the VB spectrum decreased and the sub-peak became indistinguishable. We clarified the limitation of the criterion using the sub-peak and proposed an alternative method for polarity determination.",

The relationship between the microstructural properties of preferred  c -axis oriented thin films and the hydrogen gas sensing properties is described. The crystallite size and the preferred orientation distribution were characterized by X-ray diffraction. The crystallite size increased and the preferred orientation distribution decreased with increasing film thickness. In order to control the crystallite size and the  c -axis orientation separately, a highly oriented ZnO template layer with different thickness was employed for deposition of 30-nm-thick GZO films. The  c -axis orientation of these films were nearly comparable each other, while the crystallite size increased significantly with increasing thickness of the ZnO templates. The hydrogen gas sensitivity at an operating temperature of 330 °C increased slightly with decreasing crystallite size, while the sensitivity was dramatically enhanced by increasing the preferred orientation distribution. It is therefore proposed that the  c -axis orientation plays an important role in determining the sensitivity of the hydrogen gas sensor.",

The IP technique enables a very high deposition rate of 113 nm/min compared with that of MS techniques. The structural properties of AlN films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and electron probe micro analyzer (EPMA) measurements. XRD results show that AlN films with a columnar grain structure deposited by IP have a texture with a well-defined (0001) orientation between grains normal to the substrate, whereas AlN films grown by MS have a mixture of (0001) planes and planes with other orientations. Raman spectroscopy and XRD measurement results revealed high residual compressive stress in AlN films deposited by IP compared with that in AlN films grown by MS. The analysis of the data obtained by EPMA measurement showed that IP produces AlN films with a small amount of remaining oxygen species, whereas MS produces AlN films with a large amount of residual oxygen species.",

In this study, we investigate an automatic reconstruction method for the quantitative depth measurement of the ONH from a stereo retinal fundus image pair. We propose a technique to obtain the depth value from the stereo retinal fundus image pair, which mainly consists of five steps: 1. cutout of the ONH region from the stereo retinal fundus image pair, 2. registration of the stereo image pair, 3. disparity measurement, 4. noise reduction, and 5. quantitative depth calculation. Depth measurements of 12 normal eyes are performed using the stereo fundus camera and the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT), which is a confocal laser-scanning microscope. The depth values of the ONH obtained from the stereo retinal fundus image pair were in good accordance with the value obtained using HRT (r=0.80+/-0.15). These results indicate that our proposed method could be a useful and easy-to-handle tool for assessing the cup depth of the ONH in routine diagnosis as well as in glaucoma screening.",

Particle classification performances of newly developed gas-cyclones (Type A and B) were examined by experimental and simulation studies. It was found that particle collection efficiency and classification accuracy of the type B cyclone was higher than that of the type A cyclone. The reason for this is due to the increased rotational fluid velocity in the cylindrical part and increased downward velocity in the conical part for the type B cyclone.",

In the MDC–SHG measurements, the chirality originating from the assembly of achiral molecules, however, was not detected from M53 monolayers during monolayer compression. It was found that M53 monolayers could not form chiral structures due to the geometrical constraint imposed on orientation of the molecules at the air–water interface (interfacial binding effect). To further investigate the properties of the interfacial binding effect, theoretical analysis was carried out in association with molecular ordering. The result of the MDC–SHG measurements and that of the molecular theoretical analysis demonstrated that the interfacial binding effect plays an important role in the formation of chiral structures as well as orientational structures on monolayers comprised of banana-shaped achiral molecules.",

The lowest-energy excited state follows the trend predicted for the crossing of the    3  /    2    1    −      and    5  /      2    1      −      states. Comparing the excitation energies of the    3  /    2    −     ,    5  /    2    −      and    7  /    2    −      levels from  69 Cu to  77 Cu one can see that the    Z  =  28    shell gap between the      p    3  /  2      and      f    7  /  2      states is rather stable, while the      f    5  /  2    −    f    7  /  2      spin–orbit splitting decreases by ∼1.5 MeV in agreement with shell model calculations using the tensor force.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the prevalence and characteristics of optic disc hemorrhages.We took IMAGEnet fundus photographs of 14,779 participants, aged 40 years or older in a large-scale eye disease screening project conducted in Tajimi, Japan. A single researcher reviewed all of the photographs for the presence of ocular abnormality in the optic nerve head and retina, paying special attention to the presence or absence of optic disc hemorrhages. Glaucomatous optic neuropathy was diagnosed based on the presence of nerve fiber layer defects and/or the appearance of the optic disc.Fundus photographs of 13,965 cases (27,930 eyes) were successfully reviewed bilaterally. We found disc hemorrhages at 92 locations of 92 (0.3%) eyes of 88 (0.6%) cases. Twenty-four hemorrhages of 23 (26%) cases were found in bilateral non-glaucoma cases and the remaining 68 hemorrhages of 65 (74%) cases were found in glaucoma cases. The prevalence of disc hemorrhages was 8.2% in 793 glaucoma cases and 0.2% in non-glaucoma cases. Hemorrhages developed significantly more frequently in females and in the elderly. The hemorrhages were predominantly found in the inferotemporal and superotemporal regions. The intraocular pressure was less than 20 mm Hg in all cases. The mean intraocular pressure was 15.0 mm Hg for glaucoma cases with hemorrhages and 13.9 mm Hg for non-glaucoma cases with hemorrhages.Disc hemorrhages occur more frequently in females, in elderly persons, and in glaucoma cases in Japanese aged 40 or older. The intraocular pressure of the eyes with disc hemorrhages is close to that of the normal population.",

        "abstract": "QR decomposition-based near maximum likelihood block detection significantly improves the transmission performance of uplink single-carrier (SC) multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO). Hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) is an indispensable error control technique for high-quality packet data transmission. The achievable diversity gain of HARQ depends on the packet combining strategy. In uplink MU-MIMO HARQ, the received signal may consist of new packets and retransmitted packets as retransmission for each user acts independently. In this paper, a recursive QR packet combining scheme suitable for uplink SC MU-MIMO HARQ is proposed, which takes into account the number of retransmissions for each user in the detection order. The computational complexity and required storage size can be significantly reduced by the proposed scheme. Moreover, it improves the packet error rate performance and throughput performance significantly over the conventional bit-level log likelihood ratio packet combining, as shown by our computer simulation results.

        "abstract": "The dielectric polarizations, i.e. spontaneous, linear, and second order non-linear polarizations, generated from Langmuir monolayers comprised of rod-shaped molecules were analyzed, and represented as functions of the orientational order parameters S 1 , S 2 , and S 3 ( S n = 〈 P n ( cos ⁡ θ ) 〉 , θ : molecular tilt angle, 〈 〉 : thermodynamic average, P n ( cos ⁡ θ ) : Legendre polynomial of n th order). It has been shown that the Maxwell displacement current (MDC), Brewster angle reflectometry (BAR), and optical second harmonic generation (SHG), which are attributed to the spontaneous, linear, and non-linear polarization, respectively, are capable of detecting the orientational order parameter S 1 , S 2 , and S 3 of Langmuir monolayers. An experiment using the MDC-BAR-SHG was conducted on Langmuir monolayers comprised of 4- octyl -4′- cyanobiphenyl rod-shaped molecules. It is shown that the MDC-BAR-SHG measurements are useful to investigate the orientational structure of Langmuir monolayers.",

        "abstract": "A glaucoma locus, GLC1A, was identified previously on chromosome 1q. A gene within this locus (encoding the protein myocilin) subsequently was shown to harbor mutations in 2-4% of primary open angle glaucoma patients. A total of 1703 patients was screened from five different populations representing three racial groups. There were 1284 patients from primarily Caucasian populations in Iowa (727), Australia (390) and Canada (167). A group of 312 African American patients was from New York City and 107 Asian patients from Japan. Overall, 61 different myocilin sequence variations were identified. Of the 61 variations, 21 were judged to be probable disease-causing mutations. The number of probands found to harbor such mutations in each population was: Iowa 31/727 (4.3%), African Americans from New York City 8/312 (2.6%), Japan 3/107 (2.8%), Canada 5/167 (3.0%), Australia 11/390 (2.8%) and overall 58/1703 (3. 4%). Overall, 16 (76%) of 21 mutations were found in only one population. The most common mutation observed, Gln368Stop, was found in 27/1703 (1.6%) glaucoma probands and was found at least once in all groups except the Japanese. Studies of genetic markers flanking the myocilin gene suggest that most cases of the Gln368Stop mutations are descended from a common founder. Although the specific mutations found in each of the five populations were different, the overall frequency of myocilin mutations was similar ( approximately 2-4%) in all populations, suggesting that the increased rate of glaucoma in African Americans is not due to a higher prevalence of myocilin mutations.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the three-dimensional microvascular anatomy of the optic nerve and peripapillary choroid in the rat eye.Gross vascular anatomy of the posterior eye segment of Wistar rats was studied in serial microsections with a light microscope. The optic nerve and peripapillary choroidal vessels were sequentially microdissected, using methylmethacrylate corrosion microvascular castings, and were examined with a scanning electron microscope to determine the three-dimensional relationships of the vessels.The posterior ciliary artery traveled along the inferior side of the optic nerve sheath, directly entered the optic nerve head, and divided into three branches: the central retinal artery and medial and lateral long posterior ciliary arteries, which provided several short branches to the choroid. The optic nerve head vasculature was consistently nourished by a recurrent arteriole from the central retinal artery and an arteriole from the choroidal artery at the peripapillary choroid. The central retinal vein flowed into a venous anastomosis along the optic disc border of the peripapillary choroid. Capillaries within the optic nerve drained into the central retinal vein, the marginal venous anastomosis of the peripapillary choroid, and the pial veins, all of which flowed into the posterior ciliary veins along the optic nerve sheath.The findings illustrate vascular anatomic differences in optic nerve and peripapillary choroidal microcirculation between rat and human. In rats, the peripapillary choroid plays a significant role in both blood supply and venous drainage of the optic nerve head. The central retinal artery also contributes to the optic nerve head circulation.",

Theoretical equation of uncertainty region over all particle diameter range is newly proposed and compared with computer simulation. Previous paper [H. Masuda, K. Iinoya, Theoretical study of the scatter of experimental data due to particle size distribution, J. Chem. Eng. 4(1) (1971) 60–67] reported the uncertainty region only for mass median diameter, but this paper presents the uncertainty region for all particle size range. The uncertainty region increases with the increase in particle diameter and also increases as the sample size decreases. Theoretical uncertainty region agreed with the results of computer simulation.",

We compared three different methods that employed active contour model (ACM), fuzzy c-mean (FCM) clustering, and artificial neural network (ANN) for the segmentation of the optic disc regions. The results of these methods were evaluated using new databases that included the images captured by different camera systems. The average measures of overlap between the disc regions determined by an ophthalmologist and by using the ACM (0.88 and 0.87 for two test datasets) and ANN (0.88 and 0.89) methods were slightly higher than that by using FCM (0.86 and 0.86) method. These results on the unknown datasets were comparable with those of the resubstitution test; this indicates the generalizability of these methods. The differences in the vertical diameters, which are often used for CD ratio calculation, determined by the proposed methods and based on the ophthalmologist's outlines were even smaller than those in the case of the measure of overlap. The proposed methods can be useful for automatic determination of CD ratios.",

        "abstract": "Fatigue induced by complex dysfunctions of the central nervous system is frequently complained by patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Although leptin is considered to regulate the central nervous system, there are no reports regarding its association with fatigue in those patients. This cross-sectional study included 347 patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Fatigue score and plasma leptin concentration were measured. In addition, abdominal fat accumulation, systemic inflammation, sleep condition, and functions of hypothalamus-pituitary axis and autonomic system were estimated. Plasma leptin concentration (natural logarithm transformed) was significantly and positively (r=0.222, p<0.001) associated with fatigue score, and significantly (p<0.001) higher in the moderately-fatigued group (2.32±0.75ng/ml, mean±SD, n=52) than in the normally-fatigued group (1.85±1.02ng/ml, mean±SD, n=295). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that plasma leptin concentration was significantly and independently associated with a moderately-fatigued condition independent of other factors, including age, gender, presence of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, alcohol consumption habit, urinary free cortisol, serum high-sensitive CRP concentration, visceral and subcutaneous fat area, apnea/hypopnea index, sleep efficiency, and heart rate variability. Hyperleptinemia may contribute to fatigue severity in patients with cardiovascular risk factors.",

We measured intraocular pressure at 2-hour intervals for 24 hours and performed color Doppler imaging of the orbital arteries, 48-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and visual field testing. Color Doppler parameters were compared between subjects with higher ocular perfusion pressure in the eye that had a better mean deviation (concordant group) and worse mean deviation (discordant group).In the eyes with the better mean deviation, the end-diastolic velocity of the ophthalmic artery was significantly slower in the discordant group (P=.0145), while in the eyes with the worse mean deviation, the peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities of the ophthalmic artery were significantly slower and the resistance index of the ophthalmic artery was significantly higher in the discordant group (P=.0395, P=.0088, and P=.0324, respectively). In the concordant group, the end-diastolic velocity of the central retinal artery was slower in eyes with a worse mean deviation.Retrobulbar hemodynamics are significantly altered in patients with normal-tension glaucoma who have better ocular perfusion pressure in the eye that has a worse mean deviation.",

        "abstract": "The authors determine whether intraocular pressure (IOP) increases to levels that challenge the diagnosis of normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) and determine clinical factors associated with the IOP elevation.Forty patients with NTG who met the following enrollment criteria were selected: IOPs less than 21 mm Hg during initial 24-hour pressure curve and throughout the subsequent 12 months; examined every 1 to 4 months for at least 4 years; and no ocular hypotensive treatment. The eye with the higher mean IOP during the initial 24-hour pressure curve was selected from each patient. The observation period ranged from 4.0 years to 7.8 years (mean, 5.2 years). Significant IOP elevation was defined as a significant increase (p < 0.05) of IOP over time, determined by Spearman rank correlation coefficient method. The IOP elevation was correlated to clinical factors by means of a logistic multiple regression analysis (LOGIST procedure using PC-SAS, SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, NC, U.S.A.).Eleven eyes were rated positive for IOP elevation. The regression model demonstrated that maximum IOP during the initial 24-hour pressure curve and the development of disc hemorrhage (DH) were significantly correlated with IOP elevation (p = 0.006 and p = 0.049, respectively). The odds ratios calculated were 1.98 per 1 mm Hg rise of maximum IOP during the initial 24-hour pressure curve and 6.54 for positive DH.Intraocular pressure might increase in NTG eyes following the initial diagnosis. A higher maximum IOP during initial 24-hour pressure curve and the development of DH during follow-up was significantly associated with subsequent IOP elevation in NTG patients.",

Recently, we have demonstrated that a protein inhibitor of activated STAT, PIASy, suppresses TGF-beta signaling by interacting with Sma and MAD-related protein 3 (Smad3). In this study, we examined a PIASy-dependent inhibitory effect on BMP signaling. PIASy expression was induced by BMP-2 stimulation and suppressed BMP-2-dependent Smad activity in hepatoma cells. Furthermore, BMP-2-regulated Smads directly bound to PIASy. We also demonstrated that the RING domain of PIASy played an important role in PIASy-mediated suppression of Smad activity. We here provide evidence that the inhibitory action of PIASy on BMP-regulated Smad activity was due to direct physical interactions between Smads and PIASy through its RING domain.",

        "abstract": "The equilibrium volume of a thermoresponsive polymer gel changes dramatically across a temperature due to the coil-globule transitions of the polymers. When cofacially oriented nanosheets are embedded in such a gel, the composite gel deforms at the temperature, without changing the volume, and the response time is considerably shorter. We here theoretically predict that the deformation of the composite gel results from the fact that the nanosheets restrain the deformation of some polymers, while other polymers deform relatively freely. The unrestrained polymers collapse due to the coil-globule transitions and this generates the solvent flows to the restrained regions. The response time of this process is rather fast because solvent molecules travel only by the distance of the size of a nanosheet, instead of permeating out to the external solution. This concept may provide insight in the physics of composite gels and the design of thermoresponsive gels of fast response.",

The time-course of the movement of fragmented DNA in dendrites of retinal neurons undergoing apoptotic cell death induced by intravitreal N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) injection were examined by in situ terminal dUTP-biotin nick end labeling of DNA fragments (TUNEL) method and fluorescence DNA detection technique by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The inhibitory effect of axoplasmic transport inhibitor, vincristine was also tested on the NMDA-induced fragmented DNA transport. The movement of fragmented DNA from apoptotic nuclei toward peripheral ends of the dendrites of the retinal neurons was clearly demonstrated. The transport of fragmented DNA, but not fragmentation per se, was completely inhibited by the co-administration of vincristine.",

The transparency of the lens was measured and analyzed by EAS-1000 preoperatively, then 1 and 3 months postoperatively. Changes occurred primarily in the anterior part of the lens, especially in the anterior subcapsular region. The multivariate regression analysis demonstrated an association of cataract development with age, myopic refraction, difference in preoperative and postoperative IOP and systemic hypertension.",

        "abstract": "The multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) scheme is one of the main methods for improving the frequency-efficiency in wireless communication systems. In MU-MIMO systems, a base station equipped with multiple antennas and a large number of receivers with multiple antennas communicate simultaneously. Conventionally, we adopted the principle of chaos communications to MU-MIMO and proposed a multi-user chaos MIMO (MU-C-MIMO) scheme that has physical layer security between each receiver. In the previous study, we utilized block diagonalization (BD) — a liner precoding method — to remove interference components in MU-C-MIMO. On the one hand, channel gain for each user is not maximized in BD. On the other hand, the gain maximization can be realized using nonlinear precoding, and further improvement of transmission quality is expected in MU-C-MIMO. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a MU-C-MIMO scheme using dirty paper coding (DPC), a nonlinear precoding method, in order to realize the most ideal precoding characteristics. The effectiveness of this scheme is evaluated through numerical simulations with comparisons to a conventional MU-C-MIMO system with BD.",

        "abstract": "Using a new standard, we compared the visual field defects detected by high-pass resolution perimetry (HRP) and differential light sensitivity (DLS) perimetry in 61 eyes of 61 open-angle glaucoma patients. Abnormal test points were determined using probability plot analysis of HRP and total deviation probability maps of the Humphrey Field Analyzer. To evaluate the agreement between the two tests, we developed a new scoring system. Thirty-three eyes, 23 eyes, and 5 eyes had good, fair, and poor agreement, respectively. In relation to Aulhorn's stage classification, the more advanced the glaucomatous stage, the more increased the percentages of good agreement. These results suggest that the distribution and severity of visual field defects demonstrated by HRP agree closely with those found using DLS perimetry in glaucomatous eyes, especially those with advanced visual field changes.",

        "title": "Experimental study of the knockout reaction mechanism using O 14 at 60 MeV/nucleon",
        "abstract": "Background: For the deeply bound one-nucleon removal at intermediate energies using a 9 Be or 12 C target, a strong reduction of cross section was observed relative to the prediction of eikonal theoretical model. The large disagreement has not been explained and the systematic trend is inconsistent with results from transfer reactions. The recently observed asymmetric parallel momentum distribution of the knockout residue indicates the significant dissipative core-target interaction in the knockout reaction with a composite target, implying new reaction mechanisms beyond the eikonal reaction descriptions. Purpose: To investigate the reaction mechanism for deeply bound nucleon removal at intermediate energies. Method: Neutron removal from 14 O using a 12 C target at 60 MeV/nucleon was performed. Nucleon knockout cross sections were measured. The unbound excited states of 13 O were reconstructed by using the invariant mass method with the residues and the associated decay protons measured in coincidence. The measured cross sections are compared with an intra-nuclear cascade (INC) prediction. Results: The measured cross section of (14 O, 11 C) is 60(9) mb, which is 3.5 times larger than that of (14 O, 13 O) channel. This 2pn-removal cross section is consistent with INC prediction, which is 66 mb with the main contribution being non-direct reaction processes. On the other hand, the upper limit of the cross section for one-neutron removal from 14 O followed by proton evaporation is 4.6(20) mb, integrated up to 6 MeV above the proton separation energy of 13 O. The calculated total cross section for such reaction processes by the INC model is 2.5 mb, which is within the measured upper limit. Conclusions: The data provide the first constraint on the role of core excitation and evaporation processes in deeply bound nucleon removal from asymmetric nuclei. The experiment results suggest that non-direct reaction processes, which are not considered in the eikonal model, play an important role in deeply bound nucleon removal from asymmetric nuclei at intermediate energies.",

        "abstract": "Coal fly ash was dissolved into NaOH aqueous solution and the mixture of rice husk ash as a silica source with the solution separated from the insoluble fly ash was treated hydrothermally at 373 K with microwave heating and conventional heating. Through this experiment, we investigated effects of microwave irradiation on the crystalline phase of zeolites synthesized from fly ash and clarified what process is intensively affected by the microwave irradiation. As a result, it was found that the product powder synthesized with microwave heating has a relatively higher hydroxysodalite phase than that with conventional heating, even if the synthesis conditions were the same. It was also clarified that promotion of hydroxysodalite generation by microwave irradiation is not induced by the enhancement of the crystalline phase transition from phillipsite to hydroxysodalite, but by the acceleration of hydroxysodalite formation from the precursor, aluminosilicate gel, directly. Moreover, it was found that promotion of hydroxysodalite formation is not due to the heat spot on the surface of the carbon caused by microwave irradiation. We revealed that the sensitivity, which is defined as the ratio of the quantity of generated heat to the energy of the microwave generated by the magnetron, of hydroxysodalite is almost 10 times as high as that of phillipsite. From these results, the following enhancement mechanism of hydroxysodalite crystal generation by microwave irradiation was proposed. When zeolite nuclei grow to the zeolite crystal on the interface between zeolite nuclei and aluminosilicate gel, the crystal growth of hydroxysodalite is promoted selectively as the surface temperature of hydroxysodalite is much higher than that of phillipsite in the case of microwave heating.",

        "abstract": "We investigated whether lomerizine, a new diphenylmethylpiperazine calcium channel blocker, exerted a neuroprotective effect on axonal or retinal damage induced by optic nerve injury in the rat.A partial crush lesion was inflicted unilaterally on the optic nerve, 2 mm behind the globe, in adult Wistar albino rats. Animals were treated with the vehicle, 10 or 30 mg/kg lomerizine. Each solution was given orally twice daily for 4 weeks. One week before euthanization, Fluoro-Gold (FG) was injected into both superior colliculi to retrogradely label surviving retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Approximately 1 month after the optic nerve injury, the retinal damage was assessed morphologically, and the optic nerve axons surrounding the initial lesion were examined histologically.The mean RGC density in the control group decreased to 65.9 +/- 1.32% of the contralateral eye, whereas the systemic application of 10 or 30 mg/kg of lomerizine significantly enhanced the RGC survival to 88.1 +/- 0.38% and 89.8 +/- 0.28%, respectively. Histological examination of damaged axons revealed no significant enhancement of the density or total number of axons of the retinal ganglion cells in the lomerizine-treated group. The crush force we employed caused no significant morphological differences in the retinal layers between the sham-operated animals and the animals from the experimental groups.Our findings suggest that lomerizine alleviates secondary degeneration of RGCs induced by an optic nerve crush injury in the rat, presumably by improving the impaired axoplasmic flow.",

A VF test was repeated twice in a short period on the 355 stable OAG eyes, and test-retest fluctuation, including variance at each test point and covariance between 2 test points, was calculated to simulate stable glaucomatous VF series by computer. The sensitivity of each method was calculated with 105 progressing VF series, and specificity was calculated with 10,000 simulated stable glaucomatous VF series.Sensitivity (ratios of making judgments of progression), specificity, and diagnostic power.The methods using the TD slope on one test location showed a sensitivity of 0.848 to 1.000, with a specificity of 0.105 to 0.721, and on 2 adjacent test locations showed a sensitivity of 0.848, with a specificity of 0.722. A significant negative MD slope with P<0.05 showed a sensitivity of 0.524, with a specificity of 0.945. The method using a sectored VF showed a sensitivity of 0.695, with a high specificity of 0.946. The AGIS method showed a sensitivity of 0.305 to 0.467, with a very high specificity of 0.999 to 1.000. The method using previously reported mathematically sectored VFs showed a sensitivity of 0.790, with a specificity of 0.900, and higher diagnostic power (1.69) than the others in this study population.Most of the methods using the TD slope were characterized by high sensitivity, the AGIS method had a very high specificity, and those using VF sectors had reasonable sensitivity and specificity.",

Sintered AZO targets with an Al2O3 content of 2.0 wt. % were used. DC magnetron sputtered AZO films on bare glass substrates showed a mixed (0001) and the others crystallographic orientation, and exhibited a high contribution of grain boundary scattering to carrier transport, resulting in reduced Hall mobility. Optimizing the thickness of the AZO buffer layers to 10 nm led to highly (0001)-oriented bulk AZO films with a marked reduction in the above contribution, resulting in AZO films with improved Hall...",

Two distinct patterns of angle closure were seen: type B, in which closure starts from the bottom of the angle, and type S, in which closure starts in the vicinity of Schwalbe's line. In type B, the iris root was located closure to the chamber angle than in type S.Ultrasound biomicroscopy performed under dark room conditions is a useful technique for identifying appositional angle closure in eyes with narrow angles. The topology of the iris root is related to the pattern of the appositional angle closure.",

        "abstract": "Because calcium channel blockers reduce vascular resistance, they may have a clinical application in the treatment of normal-tension glaucoma (NTG). This study investigates changes in both the optic disc blood flow and the hemodynamics of retrobulbar vessels in NTG patients after the systemic administration of a calcium channel blocker.Twelve eyes of 12 NTG patients (mean age 57.6 +/- 15.3 years) were examined before and after a 4-week treatment with 2 mg b.i.d. oral nilvadipine, an L-typc calcium channel blocker. By scanning laser-Doppler flowmetry (SLDF), we obtained the velocity, flow, and volume from within a 10 x 10 pixel window placed on the temporal rim region of the optic disc perfusion map. By ultrasound color Doppler imaging (CDI), we measured the peak systolic velocity (PSV) and the end diastolic velocity (EDV) of the ophthalmic artery (OA), central retinal artery (CRA), nasal posterior ciliary artery (NPCA), and temporal posterior ciliary artery (TPCA). We then calculated a resistance index (RI) for each vessel.After treatment, the flow and velocity of the optic disc blood flow significantly increased (P < 0.05). Nilvadipine also significantly reduced RIs of the CRA, NPCA, and TPCA (P < 0.05), and increased both the PSV of the NPCA and the EDVs of the CRA, NPCA, and TPCA. The percent change in velocity correlated significantly with the percent changes of the CRA RI and NPCA RI.Oral nilvadipine appears to reduce orbital vascular resistance, which consequently increases the optic disc blood flow.",

        "abstract": "Anti-angiogenic therapy represents a promising, new therapeutic modality for malignant gliomas. The present study was designed to define the malignant glioma cases most suitable for anti-angiogenic therapy and to demonstrate the efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapy using soluble-form Flt1 (sFlt1) gene delivery in mice. In human malignant glioma samples (39 glioblastomas, 21 anaplastic astrocytomas and 4 anaplastic oligoastrocytomas), protein expression of VEGF, and its specific natural inhibitor, sFlt1, as well as vessel architecture were assessed. Among these variables, VEGF >1000 ng/ml, VEGF/sFlt1 ratio >1, vessel density >30, and vessel area >7% were prognostic factors for malignant gliomas. VEGF/sFlt1 ratio >1 was the most powerful prognostic marker for survival in multivariate analysis. The sFlt1 gene was also successfully introduced into U87 glioma cells in vitro, resulting in 31% tumor growth inhibition in vivo. sFlt1-transfected tumor demonstrated high sFlt-1 expression along with diminished vessel density and area compared with the control tumor. In transfected tumor, VEGF expression was decreased in the viable area, but still high in the hypoxic area. sFlt1 and VEGF expression was re-evaluated in vitro using glioma cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. For sFlt1-transfected cells, VEGF expression was upregulated, but sFlt1 expression was downregulated, resulting in an increase of VEGF/sFlt1 ratio in hypoxic conditions. We conclude that malignant gliomas with a high VEGF/sFlt1 ratio and large vessel area are good candidates for anti-angiogenic therapy. Soluble Flt1 gene delivery was demonstrated to inhibit glioma growth, but this was limited in hypoxic areas.",

The aim of this study was to examine the intracellular signal transduction pathways activated by limitin.The effects of limitin on cell growth, the activation of Jak kinase and Stat proteins, and the induction of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and Daxx were examined using the mouse pre-B-cell line 18.81, wild-type, and Tyk2-deficient mouse bone marrow cells. In addition, the change of localization of the Daxx protein after limitin treatment in wild-type and Tyk2-deficient mice was examined.Limitin phosphorylates Tyk2, Jak1, Stat1, and Stat2 and rapidly induces IRF-1 mRNA production. Phosphorylation of Stat1 by limitin is partially dependent on Tyk2. Suppression of B-cell growth by limitin, however, is severely impaired in the absence of Tyk2, whereas it is unaffected by the absence of Stat1. Limitin also induces the expression and nuclear translocation of Daxx, which is essential for IFN-alpha-induced inhibition of B-lymphocyte development. The absence of Tyk2 abrogates this induction of Daxx expression and nuclear translocation.Limitin suppresses B-cell growth through activation of Tyk2, resulting in the up-regulation and nuclear translocation of Daxx. This limitin-mediated signaling pathway does not require Stat1.",

        "title": "Control of valence states for ZnS by triple-codoping method",
        "abstract": "We use In species as reactive codopants for N acceptors to realize p-type ZnS. We find a change in the impurity states of N acceptors between ZnS : N and ZnS : (2N, In), based on the calculated results using ab initio electronic band structure calculations: while we find highly localized states of N acceptors for ZnS : N, we verify delocalized states for ZnS : (2N, In). Keywords Blue-Ag emission Codoping ZnS 1 Introduction In this paper, a materials design using a triple-codoping method for the fabrication of low-resistivity p-type zinc sulfide (ZnS) with blue-Ag emission is proposed in order to realize highly efficient blue-light-emitting diodes (LED) and blue injection-laser diodes (LD). ZnS has a large band gap of 3.68 eV at room temperature. Ag impurities, which are Zn-substituting species, are well known to be the blue-Ag center (usually called activator ) [1,2] . In order to realize the blue emission of approximately 440 nm (2.81 eV), it is necessary to introduce donors as coactivators into ZnS films. Conductivity control is a necessary prerequisite for device applications: ZnS must be doped with acceptors in order to realize p-type ZnS films. To date, we have reported on p-type ZnS doped with N acceptors (ZnS : N) [3,4] and the triple-codoped p-type ZnS : (Ag, In, and N) [5] . Vapor-phase epitaxial (VPE) ZnS : (Ag, In, and N) layers were grown on semi-insulating (SI) GaAs(1 0 0) substrates with hydrogen carrier gas flow. The source material was a luminescent-grade unactivated ZnS powder [5] . Based on photoluminescence spectra, an emission at 436 nm was found to be dominant for the ZnS : (Ag, In and N) layer and it shifted to a shorter wavelength with increasing excitation intensity; this is the characteristic feature of donor–acceptor pair-type recombinations [5] . Hall-effect measurements at room temperature revealed free hole concentration and mobility values of (0.56–1.4)×10 19 cm −3 and 11–25 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , respectively, for ZnS : (Ag, In and N) [5] . Moreover, the hole concentrations of the triple-codoped layers did not show temperature dependence, indicating that the impurity bands are formatted [5] . Svob et al. have reported p-type ZnS : N with hole concentrations up to 10 18 cm −3 [6] . They found that the energy levels of the N acceptors are slightly deep, about 0.19 eV above the valence band [6] . Sufficiently, high free hole concentrations at room temperature should be realized by the codoping method previously proposed by us [7–9] . The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of In codopants on the N states of ZnS codoped with N and In species based on ab initio electronic band structure calculations. 2 Methodology The results of our band structure calculations for ZnS crystals with zincblende structures were based on the local density approximation (LDA) treatment of electronic exchange and correlation [10–12] and on the augmented spherical wave (ASW) formalism for the solution of effective single-particle equations [13] . For these calculations, the atomic sphere approximation (ASA) with a correction term was adopted. For undoped ZnS crystals, the Brillouin zone integration was carried out for 84-k points in an irreducible wedge and for 24-k points for doped and codoped ZnS crystals. For valence electrons, we employed the outermost s, p and d orbitals of Zn and S atoms and the outermost s and p orbitals of In and N atoms. The Madelung energy, which reflects the long-range electrostatic interaction within the system, was assumed to be restricted to the sum over monopoles. We studied the crystal structures of doped and codoped ZnS under periodic boundary conditions by generating supercells having 64 atoms that contain the object of interest: (1) for ZnS : N, we replaced one of the 32 sites of S atoms with an N site; (2) for ZnS : In, we replaced one of the 32 sites of Zn atoms with an In site; (3) for ZnS codoped with N and In (ZnS : (N, In)), we replaced one of the 32 sites of S atoms with a N site and one of the 32 sites of Zn atoms with an In site. First, we calculated the total energy for all cases to be considered for ZnS : (N, In). Second, we determined the crystal structure of the material under the condition that the total energy is minimized. The total energy calculations show that the formation of a N–In pair which occupies nearest-neighbor sites in the crystal is energetically favorable. Finally, to determine the crystal structure of ZnS : (2N, In), we replaced one of the remaining 31 sites of S with another N site for ZnS : (N, In), as mentioned above. Under the same total energy condition as that of ZnS : (N, In), we determined the crystal structure for ZnS : (2N, In). We find that the formation of the cluster, N–In–N, which occupies nearest-neighbor sites, is energetically favorable based on the total energy calculations. The difference in the total energy between the crystal structure having the lowest total energy and the one having the second-lowest total energy, such as the In–N pair and another N which occupy the second-nearest-neighbor sites from the In sites, is 832 meV. In this treatment, we ignore the effects of relaxation due to the dopants. 3 Results and discussion We show the total density of states (DOS) for undoped ZnS crystals as a standard reference, for ZnS : N, and for ZnS : (In, 2N), in Fig. 1 . The S 3s states are included in the calculation as valence states, but those which are located between −12.04 and −13.31 eV are omitted in the Fig. 1 . Energy is measured relative to the Fermi level ( E F ). For undoped ZnS, zero energy indicates the top of the valence band. The calculated band gap of undoped ZnS is 2.08 eV. In general, the band-gap values calculated based on the LDA are less than the values obtained by optical experiments. Inaccuracy in determining the optical band gap has little influence on the present discussion. Fig. 1(a) shows two groups in the valence band. The first group includes bands from −7.01 to −6.16 eV with strong d characteristics originating mostly from d states at Zn sites; the second group, located in the upper valence band above approximately −5.61 eV, mainly originates from the S 3p states. The letter A at −4.97 eV refers to a strong interaction between S p states and Zn s states. From approximately −3.5 eV to the top of the valence band, S p states mainly contribute to the DOS. The lowest conduction bands, antibonding states of the interaction stated above, have a strong Zn 4s contribution; there are charge transfers from Zn 4s to S 3s and 3p due to the mixing between the s and p states at S sites and the s states at Zn sites. As a result, the s and p states of the surrounding Zn shift the center of gravity of the local DOS at the S sites towards the lower energy region. In the following, we discuss the stability of the ionic charge distributions in ZnS doped with acceptors or donors in terms of the change of electrostatic energy, the Madelung energy. Fig. 1(b) shows that a hole is generated at the top of the valence band. The arrow in Fig. 1(b) at −0.1 eV refers to a sharp DOS peak induced by N doping. The peak originates in a very localized N-impurity state of which the center of gravity of the DOS at N sites shifts to a higher energy region due to the strong repulsive potential. This indicates that N doping generates a slightly deeper acceptor level above the valence band, which explains the experimental data well [6] . It is necessary that the N-impurity state change to a delocalized state for the realization of low-resistivity p-type ZnS. For ZnS : (In, 2N), no sharp DOS peak is observed, as shown in Fig. 1(c) . The arrow at −3.67 eV indicates a DOS peak resulting from the interaction between p states at S sites close to the In site and s states at the Zn site which occupies the nearest-neighbor site from the S sites and second-nearest-neighbor sites from the In atoms. We predict an increase in DOS around the corresponding energy regions for ZnS : (2N, In) compared with undoped and only N-doped ZnS, which can be verified by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). Next, we show the DOSs at N sites for ZnS : N in Fig. 2(a) and for ZnS : (2N, In) in Fig. 2(b) in order to illustrate what happens to the electronic structures, i.e., N-impurity states, near the top of the valence band upon In-codoping. They show that the impurity states at N sites change markedly from localized states, as presented in Fig. 2(a) for only N-doped ZnS, to delocalized states, as presented in Fig. 2(b) for p-type codoped ZnS. Based on the analysis of the DOS at the E F for ZnS : N, we determined that the ratio of the partial DOS of p-states at the N sites to the total DOS at the E F is 22%. The other DOS at the E F is the sum of those at the S sites in the vicinity of the N sites. This indicates a small radius of the N-acceptor orbital. In other words, the Bohr radius of the N acceptors is very small, resulting in the high ionization energies due to the heavy effective mass of holes. In addition, the Madelung energy increased by 1.19 eV compared to undoped ZnS. We propose the following codoping method [7–9] : a deliberate codoping of the donors is essential for the delocalization of the impurity states at the acceptors and the stabilization of the ionic charge distributions in p-type highly doped semiconductors. The donor is not the p-type killer but a good by-player that activates acceptors, i.e., the reactive codopant. From the calculations of the DOS at the E F , we determined that the ratio of the sum of partial DOSs of p-states at the two N sites to the total DOS at the E F is 9.2%; note that the partial DOSs not only at the S sites in the vicinity of the N sites but also at the more distant S sites contribute to the total DOS at the E F for ZnS : (2N, In). The simultaneous codoping of In as the reactive codopant and N as the acceptor into ZnS causes a large radius of the N-acceptor orbital, resulting in the low effective mass of the hole, which is a consequence of the broadened impurity band. Considering the acceptor ionization energy given by hydrogenic calculations based on the Bohr theory, it is reasonable to predict that the N-acceptor ionization energy will decrease very well. This explains experimental data for the Hall measurement of ZnS : (Ag, In, and N) [5] . There remains one further factor concerning the effects of the In-codoping on ZnS : N that we need to consider. The Madelung energy of ZnS : (2N, In) decreased significantly by 30 eV compared with that for ZnS : N, which is due to a large charge transfer from In to N atoms. This decrease causes stabilization of the ionic charge distributions of the codoped materials according to the ionic picture. We verified the same effects of the codoping on the N-acceptor states for ZnS : (2N, Ga) as those discussed above for ZnS : (2N, In). Taking into consideration that the ZnS under investigation does not have a wurtzite structure, which is favored by more ionic compounds, but a zincblende structure, the optimum amount of In or Ga to be codoped must be determined by further experiments. 4 Conclusion Simultaneous codoping using N as the acceptor and In as the reactive donor is very effective for the fabrication of low-resistivity p-type ZnS. The main role of In is to delocalize the N-impurity state by improving the incorporation of N species into ZnS. We propose a model for ZnS : (Ag, In, and N) in which some of the In species act as coactivators with Ag activators and other In species act as reactive codopants with N acceptors. Acknowledgments T.

        "abstract": " The neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive reactivity, the primary vulnerability factor of major depressive disorder (MDD) recurrence, remain unclear in individuals with recovered MDD (rMDD). Because gamma-band responses (GBRs) can be used to measure cognitive processing, they may also be useful for elucidating the mechanisms underlying cognitive reactivity. Identifying these mechanisms may permit the development of an index for predicting and preempting MDD recurrence. Here, to identify the neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive reactivity, we examined the characteristics of the GBRs evoked/induced by emotional words in participants with and without rMDD after inducing a negative mood.  Thirty-three healthy control participants and 18 participants with rMDD completed a lexical emotion identification task during electroencephalography along with assessments of cognitive reactivity after negative mood induction.  No between-group differences were identified for the task reaction times; however, the rMDD group had significantly higher cognitive reactivity scores than did the control group. Furthermore, the power of late GBRs to positive words was significantly greater in the rMDD group, with the greater power of late GBRs being related to higher cognitive reactivity.  Considering the population studied, our findings cannot be completely generalized to populations other than adolescents, people with rMDD, and those without a history of co-morbid disorders and early life stress.  Our findings indicate that the dysfunction of neural circuits related to higher-order processes like memory and attention might underlie cognitive reactivity. Altered late GBRs to positive information may be persistent biomarkers of the depression recurrence risk.",

Methods: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of hyperfractionated high-dose PBT in6 pediatric patients with newly-diagnosed skull basechordoma who were treated with PBT at our institute from 2011 to 2015. The patients were 5 males and one female, and the median age was 9 years old (range: 5 - 13). All patients received surgery before PBT. The median period between surgery and PBT was 57 days (range: 34 - 129 days). The treatment dose was 78.4 GyE in 56 fractions (twice per day). Results: All patients received PBT without severe acute toxicity. The median follow-up period was 27 months (range: 21 - 71 months). At the last follow-up, all patients were alive and all tumors were well controlled. Acute and late toxicities were generally acceptable, with only grade 1 and 2 events. Late toxicities included growth hormone abnormality and cortical hormone abnormality. One patient needed growth hormone and cortical hormone replacement therapy. Conclusion: Although the number of pediatric patients was small, our overall findings in the 6 cases indicate that hyperfractionated high-dose PBT is safe and effective for pediatric patients with skull base chordoma.",

        "abstract": "Influence of thermal annealing on electrical properties of GZO films has been studied by means of Hall effect measurements and optical characterization based on Drude model analysis for transmission and reflection spectra. Electrical resistivity increased with increasing annealing temperature. Changes of electrical properties were compared between air and N 2 gas atmosphere. Thermal stability in the air was worse compared to the N 2 gas atmosphere. Annealing at rather high temperature caused decrease in the Hall mobility and increase in optical mobility. The difference between the Hall mobility and the optical mobility was attributed to carrier scattering at grain boundaries. Three kinds of deposition method, ion plating using DC arc discharge, DC magnetron sputtering, and RF power superimposed DC magnetron sputtering were compared in terms of the thermal stability.",

Only 16.7% of the students (all Year 6) were successful on all three tasks and, in general, Year 6 students outperformed Year 8 students. The interviews revealed that the remaining students had incomplete, fragmented or non-existent structural knowledge of mixed numbers and improper fractions, and were unable to unitise or reunitise number lines. The implication for teaching is that instruction should focus on providing students with a variety of fraction representations in order to develop rich and flexible schema for all fraction types (mixed numbers, and proper and improper fractions).",

Various properties of the intermediate and calcium phosphate hydrogel from them were characterized and compared with that from calcium carbonate reagent. It was found that the intermediate from the incineration fly ash and calcium phosphate glass was more brittle than that from bone powder and calcium carbonate reagent. The electric conductivity of crystallized hydrogel obtained from all raw materials increases exponentially with temperature. However, the crystallized hydrogel from incineration fly ash has lower electric conductivity and lower crystallinity than that from bone powder and the reagent. Moreover, the difference in electric conductivity between these crystallized hydrogels decreases with temperature. Compared with using the reagent as a raw material, bone powder provides a 25% reduction in the usage of H(3)PO(4) to acquire the crystallized hydrogel which has the highest conductivity. These experimental results suggest that the incineration fly ash and bone powder are useful calcium sources for the synthesis of calcium phosphate hydrogel.",

We have been studying the flow behavior of Langmuir-film by the MDC–SHG experimental system. Shear induced phase transition accompanying the monolayer structural change from C ∞ -symmetry to C s -symmetry was detected by MDC and SHG measurement under lateral constant monolayer compression. This dynamical behavior of organic monolayer was well explained, taking into account the tilt of directors in monolayers coupled with the lattice structure of organic monolayers.",

        "abstract": "The effects of tofisopam, a GABA-receptor agonist, following oral administration (300mg)with and without allopurinol pretreatment on the plasma concentration and renal transport of uric acidand oxypurinol were investigated in 5 healthy subjects. Fractional and urinary excretions of uric acidwere both significantly increased at 2-3 hours after tofisopam administration (559% and 459%,respectively), while plasma uric acid concentration was significantly decreased (36%) at 2.5 hours,suggesting that tofisopam affects uric acid metabolism via the tubular transport system. Thehypouricemic effect of tofisopam was comparable to or greater than that of losartan and/orfenofibrate, which also have uric acid-lowering activity. In addition, with prior administration of allopurinol, the fractionaland urinary excretions of oxypurinol were increased at 2-3 hours after tofisopam administration (51% and 33%,respectively), while the plasma oxypurinol concentration was significantly decreased at 1.5 and 2.5 hours (15% and 21%,respectively). Accordingly, tofisopam may be an attractive compound for treatment of hyperuricemia and/or gout,especially in patients complicated with autonomic dysfunction symptoms, though it is possible that the uric acid-loweringeffect of oxypurinol is attenuated by tofisopam.",

This report examines whether there is any correlation between the amount of individual variability in IOP reduction and the uveoscleral outflow facility after latanoprost eyedrop instillation in normal-tension glaucoma patients.Sixteen normal-tension glaucoma patients (mean age, 56.4 years) were enrolled in the study to investigate the relationship between the amount of IOP reduction and outflow facility. Before treatment, subjects underwent circadian IOP measurement and then tonography, and the outflow facility was calculated. Subsequently, patients began treatment once daily with latanoprost instillation in one eye. After 4 weeks of daily latanoprost treatment, circadian IOP was measured again.Mean pretreatment outflow facility was 0.23 +/- 0.05 microl/min per mmHg. On average, latanoprost instillation decreased IOP by 2.8 mmHg, but the reduction varied among individuals from -0.3 mmHg to 5.8 mmHg. No significant correlation was noted between the outflow facility and the IOP decline associated with latanoprost.Because there was no significant correlation between individual IOP reduction by latanoprost and outflow facility, the differences in substantial change in uveoscleral outflow after latanoprost administration may be one explanation for the individual variation in IOP reduction after treatment with this drug.",

        "abstract": "Current-voltage properties for a Ba 1−x K x BiO 3 /Nb-doped SrTiO 3 (0.01 wt%) Schottky junction have been measured and investigated over a temperature range from 5.3 to 300 K. Excellent rectification properties of the junction were observed, with high reproducibility. The barrier height V 60 decreased and the ideality factor n increased with decreasing temperature. The modified Richardson plot of saturation current density showed a straight-line dependence. These results may be explained by the existence of interfacial layer or the inhomogeneity of the Schottky barrier height.",

        "abstract": "Phospholipid organic monolayer at the air–water interface was studied in the presence of magnesium ions. For this reason the domain size by Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) as well as the Gibbs energy by thermodynamic analysis is evaluated. Domain size increase is discussed with respect to the shape equation on the basis of the electrostatic energy contribution. By coupling these techniques it was found that for ion adsorption at first it is preferred domain boundary and liquid expanded (LE) phase. Only after reaching of specific concentration (30 mM) ions are adsorbed also inside of the liquid condensed (LC) domain. Evaluation of BAM images and thermodynamic analysis reveals existence of pure repulsive forces; it is illustrated by gradual increase of average domain area. Additionally, in low magnesium ion concentration region it was successful to use Langmuir adsorption isotherm for fitting the observed domain area.",

Wafer implantation plays an important role in improving the prognosis of HGG patients, but it often causes particular changes as observed on neuroimaging and various adverse effects (AEs). Here, we conducted a questionnaire-based survey of Japanese neurosurgeons to determine how they feel about this treatment based on their actual observations. Most neurosurgeons had a positive impression of the treatment based on previous evidence of clinical effectiveness. Additionally, we found that the Japanese neurosurgeons are taking measures to cope with some AEs including cerebral edema, postoperative convulsions, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and protracted wound healing.",

Mitomycin concentrations varied from 0.1 to 0.8 mg/ml (range of means for 10 situations 0.31-0.39 mg/ml) and intraoperative application times ranged from 5 s to 7 min (range of means for 10 situations 2.5-4.6 min). Preferences for either no antifibrosis agent (up to 39%) or 5-fluorouracil (up to 29%) were highest in primary trabeculectomy. Thirty-seven percent to 64% of AGS members used glaucoma drainage devices, especially after complicated postsurgical glaucomas (after penetrating keratoplasty, scleral buckling, or pars plana vitrectomy) and in neovascular glaucoma, but few JGS members used them. Large differences between university- and private practice-based AGS members were found only in mitomycin use for primary trabeculectomy (33% vs. 52%, respectively; p = 0.07) and for complicated postsurgical glaucomas (46% vs. 70%, respectively; p = 0.03).Trabeculectomy with mitomycin was the preferred surgical procedure among AGS and JGS members in the clinical situations surveyed. Mitomycin concentration and time of application varied widely. Many respondents used 5-fluorouracil or no antimetabolite in primary trabeculectomy. Glaucoma drainage devices were widely used for complicated glaucomas in the United States.",

        "abstract": "In the current article, we provide in vitro efficacy evaluation of a unique accelerator-based neutron source, constructed at the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (Novosibirsk, Russian Federation), for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), which is particularly effective in the case of invasive cancers. U251MG, CHO-K1 and V79 cells were incubated and irradiated in various concentrations of boric acid with epithermal neutrons for 2-3 h in a plexiglass phantom, using 2.0 MeV proton energy and 1.5-3.0 mA proton current, resulting in a neutron fluence of 2.16 × 1012 cm-2. The survival curves of cells loaded with boron were normalized to those irradiated without boron (to exclude the influence of the fast neutron and gamma dose components) and fit to the linear-quadratic (LQ) model. Colony formation assays showed the following cell survival rates (means ± SDs): CHO-K1: 0.348 ± 0.069 (10 ppm), 0.058 ± 0.017 (20 ppm), 0.018 ± 0.005 (40 ppm); V79: 0.476 ± 0.160 (10 ppm), 0.346 ± 0.053 (20 ppm), 0.078 ± 0.015 (40 ppm); and U251MG: 0.311 ± 0.061 (10 ppm), 0.131 ± 0.022 (20 ppm), 0.020 ± 0.010 (40 ppm). The difference between treated cells and controls was significant in all cases (P < 0.01) and confirmed that the neutron source and irradiation regimen were sufficient for control over cell colony formation. We believe our study will serve as a model for ongoing in vitro experiments on neutron capture therapy to advance in this area for further development of accelerator-based BNCT into the clinical phase.",

        "abstract": "QR decomposition‐based near maximum likelihood block detection significantly improves\n         the transmission performance of uplink single‐carrier (SC) multi‐user multiple‐input\n         multiple‐output (MU‐MIMO). Hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) is an indispensable\n         error control technique for high‐quality packet data transmission. The achievable\n         diversity gain of HARQ depends on the packet combining strategy. In uplink MU‐MIMO\n         HARQ, the received signal may consist of new packets and retransmitted packets as\n         retransmission for each user acts independently. In this paper, a recursive QR packet\n         combining scheme suitable for uplink SC MU‐MIMO HARQ is proposed, which takes into\n         account the number of retransmissions for each user in the detection order. The computational\n         complexity and required storage size can be significantly reduced by the proposed\n         scheme. Moreover, it improves the packet error rate performance and throughput performance\n         significantly over the conventional bit‐level log likelihood ratio packet combining,\n         as shown by our computer simulation results.

The non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme has been studied as one of the potential solutions. In addition to the need for higher capacity, the demand for secure wireless transmission has also grown. To meet these requirements, we propose a chaos multiple-input multiple-output (C-MIMO) scheme that realizes both physical layer security and channel coding gain. In this paper, we apply the principle of C-MIMO to the NOMA scheme, and propose a chaos NOMA scheme that achieves higher-capacity, enabling a secure downlink wireless communication system. By performing numerical simulations, we show that compared to conventional power-domain NOMA schemes, we obtain improved performances and the physical layer security effect by introducing the C-MIMO principle into NOMA. In addition, we show that the throughput enhancement is obtained in the proposed scheme compared to previously proposed chaos orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (C-OFDMA) scheme.",

Firstly, the GZO films were prepared on glass substrates by ion plating with dc arc discharge, and the AZO films were then deposited on the GZO films by direct current magnetron sputtering (DC-MS). The GZO interface layers with a preferential c-axis orientation play a critical role in producing AZO films with texture development of a well-defined (0001) orientation, whereas 500-nm-thick AZO films deposited by only DC-MS showed a mixture of the c-plane and the other plane orientation, to exhibit a μ H of 38.7 cm(2)/Vs with an N of 2.22 × 10(20) cm(-3).

        "abstract": "Recent genetic analysis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) showed that the MyD88 L265P mutation, which is related to NF-kB signaling, was a genetic hallmark for PCNSL; thus, it could serve as a genetic marker for diagnosis and a potential target for molecular therapy. However, the role of the MyD88 mutation in PCNSL has not been defined. In this study, we investigated the role of the MyD88 mutation and the clinical features of PCNSL-treated patients at several institutions to determine its significance as a prognostic factor. Forty-one PCNSL (diffuse large B cell type) patients from 8 institutions were included in this study. Their median age was 68 years; median follow-up was 26.7 months; median overall survival was 26.7 months; and their 1-year, 3-year and 5-year survival rates were 75.6%, 58.5%, and 43.9%, respectively. DNA was extracted from frozen tissue and the MyD88 L265P mutation was evaluated by PCR and direct sequencing. The MyD88 L265P mutation was found in 61.0% (25/41) of cases. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that neither MyD88 L265P mutation nor age > 65 years alone significantly predicted overall survival relative to MyD88 wild type and age <65. The MyD88 L265P mutation was predominantly present in patients aged > 65 years. Among age >65 patients, MyD88 L265P mutation portended a worse overall survival compared to MyD88 wild type (11.5 vs 56.2 months p<0.04). The MyD88 L265P mutation predicted a poor prognosis in elderly PCNSL patients. A new tailor-made treatment strategy might be needed for these patients.",

Several clinical factors were investigated to find a possible association with the progression of glaucomatous visual field defined by two different definitions: one by mean deviation change and the other by glaucoma change probability analysis.Disk hemorrhage, corrected-pattern standard deviation, age, systolic blood pressure, and pulse rate had a significant influence on the visual field defect. The cumulative probability of progression of visual field loss was significantly greater for patients with disk hemorrhage than for patients without disk hemorrhage by either criterion for progression (P </=.0008, logrank test). All eyes that had at least two occurrences of disk hemorrhage showed progression, whereas only three of nine eyes showed progression in the nonrecurrent disk hemorrhage group by the glaucoma change probability analysis. The difference was statistically significant (P <.0001, Fisher's exact probability test). Furthermore, there was a significant relationship between the location of the disk hemorrhage and the area of the progression of visual field loss in 65.4% of progressive patients with disk hemorrhage.Several clinical factors other than intraocular pressure are significantly associated with the progression of visual field loss during the natural course of normal-tension glaucoma. Among these, disk hemorrhage is a significantly negative prognostic factor in patients with normal-tension glaucoma and may be a sign of progressive damage of the retinal nerve fiber layer, leading to functional deterioration of the visual field.",

Eighty eyes, including 25 eyes with the signs of glaucoma, were imaged by a stereo retinal fundus camera. An ophthalmologist provided the outlines of cup and disc on a regular monitor and on the stereo display. The depth image of the ONH was created by determining the corresponding pixels in a pair of images based on the correlation coefficient in localized regions. The areas of the disc and cup were determined by use of the red component in one of the color images and by use of the depth image, respectively. The C/D ratio was determined based on the largest vertical lengths in the cup and disc areas, which was then compared with that by the ophthalmologist. The disc areas determined by the computerized method agreed relatively well with those determined by the ophthalmologist, whereas the agreement for the cup areas was somewhat lower. When C/D ratios were employed for distinction between the glaucomatous and non-glaucomatous eyes, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.83. The computerized analysis of ONH can be useful for diagnosis of glaucoma.",

Aneurysms resulting from vasculitis are common at the periphery, rather than at vessel bifurcations. Cyclic inflammatory activity causes progressive destruction of the blood vessel wall, further expanding the lumen and forming an aneurysm. Therefore, such aneurysms are more fragile than true aneurysms, and are more likely to be damaged or detached during surgery, as in the present case. Trapping of the parent artery should be considered when the aneurysm is damaged or detached. Accordingly, preoperative planning could anticipate the need for superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass.",

Seven eyes had an upper hemifield defect and four had a lower defect, determined by DLS with a Humphrey Field Analyzer (Zeiss-Humphrey, Inc., San Leandro, CA, U.S.A.). Frequency-doubling perimetry and DLS perimetry were conducted less than 7 days apart. To quantitatively detect nerve fiber layer defect (NFLD), scanning laser ophthalmoscopy was also performed.Of the 11 intact hemifields, seven showed NFLD. Of the seven, six also showed visual field defects by FDP. Of the four eyes without NFLD, two showed no defects in the intact hemifield by FDP. The threshold values of FDP and DLS perimetry did not significantly correlate in either the intact or the defective hemifields, or in the total field. The average test time of FDP was approximately 6 minutes.Frequency-doubling perimetry may detect early glaucomatous visual field defects.",

        "abstract": "Transplanted embryonic stem (ES) cells can be integrated into the retinas of adult mice as well-differentiated neuronal cells. However, the integrated ES cells also have a tumorigenic effect just because they have the ability for multipotential differentiation to various types of tissues. Thus, control of neoplastic potentials of ES cells is very important for the treatment of degenerative or injured diseases. Mouse ES cells carrying the sequence for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene were transplanted into adult mouse retinas by intravitreal injections 20 h after intravitreal N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) administration. One week after the ES cell injection, folate antagonist methotrexate (MTX) was injected intravitreally. Eyes were retrieved 4 weeks after ES cell transplantation for histologic analyses. Conventional histological analysis was performed by hematoxylin and eosin staining with the use of paraffin-embedded sections. Neuronal differentiation and teratogenic potential of ES cells were demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. The proliferative activity of transplanted cells was detected by mitotic index, proliferating cell nuclear antigen index and AgNOR count. The incorporation of transplanted ES cells in MTX-treated and non-treated retinas at 4 weeks after transplantation was observed in 8/16 eyes (50%) and 8/16 eyes (50%), respectively. Transplanted ES cells in MTX-treated retina showed increased neuronal differentiation and decreased expression of teratogenic markers, compared with ES cells in non-treated retina. The proliferative activity of transplanted ES cells in MTX-treated retina was lower than that in non-treated retina. These results suggest that intravitreal MTX treatment following transplantation can induce neuronal differentiation in the transplanted ES cells and decrease their proliferative activity.",

We applied Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis for the detection of disc hemorrhages before and after trabeculectomy.Trabeculectomy significantly reduced IOP (in POAG: 19.6 +/- 4.4 down to 11.1 +/- 4.2 mm Hg; in NTG: 15.3 +/- 1.5 down to 11.3 +/- 4.5 mm Hg; mean +/- SD). Life-table analysis revealed that the final cumulative probability of detecting a disc hemorrhage after surgery in POAG was 5.5 +/- 2.2% (calculated probability +/- SE) and was significantly lower than that (33.4 +/- 7.8%) before surgery (P < 0.0001, log-rank test). Likewise, the final probability after surgery in NTG was 23.1 +/- 6.3% and was significantly lower than that (42.1 +/- 8.8%) before surgery (P = 0.0063, log-rank test).IOP reduction via surgical intervention significantly decreases the frequency of disc hemorrhages in open-angle glaucoma patients.",

        "abstract": "Hyperuricemia occurs together with abnormal glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. Skeletal muscle is an important organ of glucose uptake, disposal, and storage. Metformin activates adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to regulate insulin signaling and promote the translocation of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4), thereby stimulating glucose uptake to maintain energy balance. Our previous study showed that high uric acid (HUA) induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle tissue. However, the mechanism of metformin ameliorating UA-induced insulin resistance in muscle cells is unknown and we aimed to determine it. In this study, differentiated C2C12 cells were exposed to UA (15 mg/dl), then reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected with DCFH-DA and glucose uptake with 2-NBDG. The levels of phospho-insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1; Ser307), phospho-AKT (Ser473) and membrane GLUT4 were examined by western blot analysis. The impact of metformin on UA-induced insulin resistance was monitored by adding Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, and LY294002, a PI3K/AKT inhibitor. Our data indicate that UA can increase ROS production, inhibit IRS1-AKT signaling and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and induce insulin resistance in C2C12 cells. Metformin can reverse this process by increasing intracellular glucose uptake and ameliorating UA-induced insulin resistance.",

        "abstract": "Daxx has been shown to play an essential in type I interferon (IFN-alpha/beta)-mediated suppression of B cell development and apoptosis. Recently, we demonstrated that Tyk2 is directly involved in IFN signaling for the induction and nuclear translocation of Daxx, which may result in growth arrest and/or apoptosis of B lymphocyte progenitors. To clarify the mechanism of Daxx-mediated apoptosis signaling in B lymphocyte progenitors, here we introduced an efficient suicide switch in a murine pro-B cell line, BAF3, by expressing FK506-binding protein-fused Fas intracellular domain (FKBP-Fas) and Daxx. It allows us to monitor Fas/Daxx-mediated signal by induction of Fas dimerization with the dimerizer drug AP20187. AP20187-mediated Fas dimerization induced not only apoptosis but also Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. However, AP20187 had no effect on cells expressing either Fas or Daxx only. Furthermore, expression of a JNK inhibitor, the JNK-binding domain of JIP-1, resulted in resistance to AP20187-mediated apoptosis in cells expressing FKBP-Fas and Daxx. These results imply that our novel suicide switch system may provide a powerful tool to delineate or identify the signaling molecules for Daxx-mediated apoptotic machinery in B lymphocyte progenitors through JNK activation.",

Estrogens have key roles in a variety of biological events, such as the development and maintenance of numerous target tissues. Previous studies demonstrated that estrogens suppress BMP functions by repressing BMP gene expression. Here we present a novel mechanism for the inhibitory effect of estrogens on BMP function. BMP-2-induced activation of Sma and Mad (mothers against decapentaplegic)-related protein (Smad) activity and BMP-2-mediated gene expression were suppressed by 17beta-E2 in breast cancer cells and mesangial cells. E2-mediated inhibition of Smad activation was reversed by tamoxifen, an ER antagonist. We provide evidence that the inhibitory action of ER on Smad activity was due to direct physical interactions between Smads and ER, which represents a novel mechanism for the cross-talk between BMP and ER signaling pathways.",

Early detection of NFLDs is critical for improved prognosis of this progressive, blinding disease. We have investigated a computerized scheme for detection of NFLDs on retinal fundus images. In this study, 162 images, including 81 images with 99 NFLDs, were used. After major blood vessels were removed, the images were transformed so that the curved paths of retinal nerves become approximately straight on the basis of ellipses, and the Gabor filters were applied for enhancement of NFLDs. Bandlike regions darker than the surrounding pixels were detected as candidates of NFLDs. For each candidate, image features were determined and the likelihood of a true NFLD was determined by using the linear discriminant analysis and an artificial neural network (ANN). The sensitivity for detecting the NFLDs was 91% at 1.0 false positive per image by using the ANN. The proposed computerized system for the detection of NFLDs can be useful to physicians in the diagnosis of glaucoma in a mass screening.",

However, it requires a fairly large number M of surviving paths in the M-algorithm and leads to very high computational complexity. Replacing the CP by training sequence (TS) was shown to reduce the number of M. Another approach to reduce the complexity of QRM-MLBD is to modify the tree structure constructed by QR decomposition for ML detection. Recently, we proposed a 2-step QRM-MLBD which prunes unreliable symbol candidates before tree search by using the minimum mean square error based frequency-domain equalization (MMSE-FDE) output. In this paper, we apply the 2-step QRM-MLBD to TS inserted SC (TS-SC) transmission in order to further reduce the complexity of QRM-MLBD. We show by computer simulation that 2-step QRM-MLBD can reduce the complexity compared to conventional QRM-MLBD while keeping almost the same BER performance.",

        "abstract": "Exosomes are 30–100 nm-sized membranous vesicles, secreted from a variety of cell types into their surrounding extracellular space. Various exosome components including lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids are transferred to recipient cells and affect their function and activity. Numerous studies have showed that tumor cell-derived exosomes play important roles in tumor growth and progression. However, the effect of exosomes released from oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) into the tumor microenvironment remains unclear. In the present study, we isolated exosomes from OSCC cells and investigated the influence of OSCC cell-derived exosomes on the tumor cell behavior associated with tumor development. We demonstrated that OSCC cell-derived exosomes were taken up by OSCC cells themselves and significantly promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion through the activation of the PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK, and JNK-1/2 pathways in vitro. These effects of OSCC cell-derived exosomes were obviously attenuated by treatment with PI3K, ERK-1/2, and JNK-1/2 pharmacological inhibitors. Furthermore, the growth rate of tumor xenografts implanted into nude mice was promoted by treatment with OSCC cell-derived exosomes. The uptake of exosomes by OSCC cells and subsequent tumor progression was abrogated in the presence of heparin. Taken together, these data suggest that OSCC cell-derived exosomes might be a novel therapeutic target and the use of heparin to inhibit the uptake of OSCC-derived exosomes by OSCC cells may be useful for treatment.",

        "abstract": "Aging is an inevitable process that involves changes along life in multiple neurochemical, neuroanatomical, hormonal systems, and many others. In addition, these biological modifications lead to an increase in age-related sickness such as cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, neurodegenerative disorders, and sleep disturbances, among others that affect activities of daily life. Demographic projections have demonstrated that aging will increase its worldwide rate in the coming years. The research on chronic diseases of the elderly is important to gain insights into this growing global burden. Novel therapeutic approaches aimed for treatment of age-related pathologies have included the endocannabinoid system as an effective tools since this biological system shows beneficial effects in preclinical models. However, and despite these advances, little has been addressed in the arena of the endocannabinoid system as option for treating sleep disorders in aging since experimental evidence suggests that some elements of the endocannabinoid system modulate the sleep-wake cycle. This article addresses this less-studied field, focusing on the likely perspective of the implication of the endocannabinoid system in the regulation of sleep problems reported in aged. We conclude that beneficial effects regarding the putative efficacy of the endocannabinoid system as therapeutic tools in aging is either inconclusive or still missing.",

Several clinical factors were investigated to find a possible association with progression of glaucomatous visual field defined by two different definitions: one by mean deviation change and the other by pointwise comparison.The Cox proportional hazards model indicated that change in the visual field was significantly associated with treatment with calcium channel blockers, recovery rate from a cold recovery test, systolic blood pressure, disc hemorrhage, corrected pattern standard deviation, mean deviation, and fluctuation of intraocular pressure (IOP) at a 24-hour phasing. The probability of nonprogression of visual field loss was significantly higher for patients taking calcium channel blockers than for control subjects by either definition of visual field progression.Factors other than IOP, including the use of calcium channel blockers, are associated with the outcome of visual field loss in NTG.",

We have previously proposed an automated scheme for detection of retinal nerve fiber layer defect (NFLD), which is one of the early signs of glaucoma observed on retinal fundus images. In this study, a new multi-step detection scheme was included to improve detection of subtle and narrow NFLDs. In addition, new features were added to distinguish between NFLDs and blood vessels, which are frequent sites of false positives (FPs). The result was evaluated with a new test dataset consisted of 261 cases, including 130 cases with NFLDs. Using the proposed method, the initial detection rate was improved from 82% to 98%. At the sensitivity of 80%, the number of FPs per image was reduced from 4.25 to 1.36. The result indicates the potential usefulness of the proposed method for early detection of glaucoma.",

In 2-step QRM-MLBD, unreliable symbol candidates are removed by performing minimum mean square error based frequency-domain equalization (MMSE-FDE) prior to QRM-MLBD. However, a large number M of surviving paths is still required in the M-algorithm to achieve a BER performance close to the matched filter (MF) bound. In this paper, to remedy this problem, we introduce a detection ordering to 2-step QRM-MLBD. We will show by computer simulation that the use of detection ordering can achieve the same BER performance as 2-step QRM-MLBD while reducing the computational complexity.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the role of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in retinal damage, tPA-deficient and wild-type mice were employed. Two different retinal neuron insult models were used in the present study. One is an excitotoxin-treated retinal model, created by direct intravitreal injection of glutamate analogs, NMDA or kainic acid (KA), and the other is an ischemia–reperfusion model induced by transient elevation of intraocular pressure. TdT-dUTP terminal nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method was used to examine the retinal cell nuclear damage. The number of TUNEL-positive cells in ganglion cell layer (GCL) and inner nuclear layer (INL) in tPA-deficient mice after low-, but not high-dose NMDA was significantly less compared to wild type. In contrast, neither intravitreal KA or transient ischemia produced significant difference in retinal damage in tPA vs. wild-type mice. These data show that tPA-deficient mice are resistant to retinal damage by intravitreal injection of NMDA, and indicate that tPA plays a role in the retinal cell damage induced by excitotoxins, especially NMDA.",

The electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness and transparency of the films were investigated. Hall effect measurements showed that a decrease in resistivity with thickness causes an effective decrease in sheet resistance of the films. With decreasing sheet resistance, the EMI shielding effectiveness of the films at a frequency of 2.45 GHz increased, and the highest shielding effectiveness was 47.4 dB. All of the films demonstrated visible transmission of more than 70%.",

        "abstract": "Heat resistance of Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) films have been studied for films deposited by an ion-plating with DC-arc discharge. Influences of O2 flow rate during the deposition and atmosphere on heat resistance was examined. Electrical properties of the GZO films changed depending on the O2 flow rate during deposition. The minimum resistivity was obtained at the O2 flow rate of 11 sccm. The heat resistance slightly depended on the O2 flow rate. By controlling the deposition condition, we obtained the GZO film with resistivity of 2.5 × 10-4 Ωcm, which was stable up to 400 °C in N2 atmosphere, and the resistivity of 2.9 × 10-4 Ωcm, stable up to 300 °C in air atmosphere. Although the resistivity was stable up to the critical temperature, the Hall mobility increased and the carrier concentration decreased with increasing the annealing temperature. As the result, optical transmission spectra were affected by the thermal annealing even below the critical temperature.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, composite materials were fabricated using the thermoplastic resin poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and recycled carbon fibers obtained by pulverizing carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP). PMMA particles were adsorbed on the carbon fiber surfaces  via  electrostatic interactions, to promote the interfacial adhesion between the carbon fibers and the PMMA resin and thereby improve the dispersion of the fibers in the resin. This enhanced the mechanical properties of the composites; the yield stress and elastic modulus of the composite. As a result, the yield stress and elastic modulus of the composite improved owing to the prevention of void formation in the composite resulting from the chemical incompatibility between the filler and the resin and better dispersion of the PMMA-adsorbed carbon fibers in the resin compared to that in the unmodified fibers. This method can be applied to fabricate high-quality composites consisting of a combination of other resins and fillers.",

The photoelectron energy-loss struc- tures of in situ fractured surface in ultrahigh vacuum can be approximated by a sum of four components for SrTiO3 and BaTiO3, and of three components for TiO2. Electronic structures were calculated from first prin- ciples using the full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave method in the local-density approximation. The momentum matrix elements between Bloch functions were evaluated to determine the electron energy-loss functions. The theoretical electron energy-loss functions agree well with experimental spectra except a struc- ture at around 20 eV of SrTiO3 and that at around 18 eV of BaTiO3. The difference of high binding energy peaks is explained from the positions of semicore states.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVEErythropoietin (EPO) is a clinically available hematopoietic cytokine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of EPO on a rat model of cervical cord compression myelopathy and to explore the possibility of its use as a pharmacological treatment.METHODSTo produce the chronic cervical cord compression model, thin polyurethane sheets were implanted under the C5-C6 laminae of rats and gradually expanded due to water absorption. In this model, motor functions significantly declined from 7 weeks after surgery. Based on the result, EPO administration was started 8 weeks after surgery. Motor function as seen with rotarod performance and grip strength was measured 16 weeks after surgery, and then motor neurons were stained with H-E and NeuN staining, and counted. Apoptotic cell death was assessed with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. To assess transfer of EPO into spinal cord tissue, the EPO level in spinal cord tissue was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for each group after subcutaneous injection of EPO.RESULTSHigh-dose EPO (5000 IU/kg) administered from 8 weeks after surgery markedly restored and maintained motor function in the Compression groups (P u003c 0.01). EPO significantly prevented loss of motor neurons in the anterior horn (P u003c 0.05) and significantly decreased the number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells (P u003c 0.05). The EPO level in spinal cord tissue was significantly higher in the High-dose EPO group than other groups.CONCLUSIONSEPO improves motor function in rats with progressive chronic compression myelopathy. EPO protects anterior horn motor neurons and inhibits neuronal cell apoptosis in spinal cord compression. The neuroprotective effects can be produced through transfer of EPO into spinal cord tissue. These findings suggest that EPO has high potential as a treatment for developing compression myelopathy.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the long-term clinical course of acute primary angle closure (APAC) and acute primary angle-closure glaucoma (APACG) in Japanese patients.We retrospectively reviewed our records of 66 consecutive APAC or APACG eyes observed between February 1992 and December 2003 (mean follow-up, 42.1 months). Immediately after the diagnosis, all patients had received similar medications to halt the acute attack. Subsequently, laser iridotomy or surgical peripheral iridectomy and/or laser iridoplasty were conducted. If intraocular pressure (IOP) control was poor under maximum tolerable ocular hypotensive agents, trabeculectomy with adjunctive mitomycin C (MMC) was undertaken.After laser therapy, the probability of success, defined as an IOP of <21 mmHg with or without medications, was 81.2% +/- 6.2%. In the ten eyes that were trabeculectomized, the probability of success based on the same criterion was 40.0% +/- 29.7%. Multivariate analysis revealed that the degree of synechial angle closure (P = 0.029) and the preexistence of chronic glaucomatous optic neuropathy (P = 0.015) significantly influenced the need for subsequent filtering surgery.Without the intervention of filtering surgery, 84.6% of eyes with APAC or APACG maintained IOP control with or without antiglaucoma medications. However, APAC and APACG eyes that eventually received trabeculectomy were predisposed to an uncontrollable IOP, even with the intraoperative application of MMC. The severity of APAC or APACG in Japanese may be affected by an underlying creeping angle closure.",

All fundus photographs were graded by one masked examiner to determine the presence of DHs.Good quality fundus photographs were available for both eyes of 2761 subjects. DHs were found in at least one eye of 34 subjects (1.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8-1.6%). The prevalence was 14.0% (95% CI, 8.0-19.9%), 9.7% (2.9-16.6%), and 0.4% (0.1-0.6%) in subjects with definitive glaucoma, glaucoma suspects, and subjects without glaucoma, respectively. Logistic regression analyses indicated that DHs were associated with glaucoma (P<0.001), glaucoma suspects (P<0.001), and older age (P=0.032). No Heidelberg Retina Tomograph parameters differed between subjects with and without DHs.The prevalence of DHs was 1.2% in an elderly Japanese population, which was similar to other population studies. In addition to glaucoma, older age was associated with higher prevalence of DHs.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to reappraise long-term treatment outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for vestibular schwannomas (VSs). The authors used a database that included patients who underwent SRS with a unique dose-planning technique, i.e., partial tumor coverage designed to avoid excess irradiation of the facial and cochlear nerves, focusing on tumor control and hearing preservation. Clinical factors associated with post-SRS tumor control and long-term hearing preservation were also analyzed. METHODS This institutional review board-approved, retrospective cohort study used the authors' prospectively accumulated database. Among 207 patients who underwent Gamma Knife SRS for VSs between 1990 and 2005, 183 (who were followed up for at least 36 post-SRS months) were studied. The median tumor volume was 2.0 cm (range 0.05-26.2 cm). The median prescribed dose at the tumor periphery was 12.0 Gy (range 8.8-15.0 Gy; 12.0 Gy was used in 171 patients [93%]), whereas tumor portions facing the facial and cochlear nerves were irradiated with 10.0 Gy. As a result, 72%-99% of each tumor was irradiated with the prescribed dose. The mean cochlear doses ranged from 2.3 to 5.7 Gy (median 4.1 Gy). RESULTS The median durations of imaging and audiometric follow-up were 114 months (interquartile range 73-144 months) and 59 months (interquartile range 33-109 months), respectively. Tumor shrinkage was documented in 110 (61%), no change in 48 (27%), and enlargement in the other 22 (12%) patients. A further procedure (FP) was required in 15 (8%) patients. Thus, the tumor growth control rate was 88% and the clinical control rate (i.e., no need for an FP) was 92%. The cumulative FP-free rates were 96%, 93%, and 87% at the 60th, 120th, and 180th post-SRS month, respectively. Six (3%) patients experienced facial pain, and 2 developed transient facial palsy. Serviceable hearing was defined as a pure tone audiogram result better than 50 dB. Among the 66 patients with serviceable hearing before SRS who were followed up, hearing acuity was preserved in 23 (35%). Actuarial serviceable hearing preservation rates were 49%, 24%, and 12% at the 60th, 120th, and 180th post-SRS month, respectively. On univariable analysis, only cystic-type tumor (HR 3.36, 95% CI 1.18-9.36; p = 0.02) was shown to have a significantly unfavorable association with FP. Multivariable analysis followed by univariable analysis revealed that higher age (≥ 65 years: HR 2.66, 95% CI 1.16-5.92; p = 0.02), larger tumor volume (≥ 8 cm: HR 5.36, 95% CI 1.20-17.4; p = 0.03), and higher cochlear dose (mean cochlear dose > 4.2 Gy: HR 2.22, 95% CI 1.07-4.77; p = 0.03) were unfavorable factors for hearing preservation. CONCLUSIONS Stereotactic radiosurgery achieved good long-term results in this series. Tumor control was acceptable, and there were few serious complications in patients with small- to medium-sized VSs. Unfortunately, hearing preservation was not satisfactory. However, the longer the observation period, the more important it becomes to compare post-SRS hearing decreases with the natural decline in untreated cases.",

This prospective study sought to determine the incidence, severity, and prognosis of bleb-related infection and to investigate the efficacy of the antibacterial therapy in preventing it.Prospective cohort study.A total of 908 eyes of 908 glaucoma patients who had undergone mitomycin C-augmented trabeculectomy or trabeculectomy combined with phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation performed at 34 clinical centers.Outcomes were measured at 6-month intervals, with special attention to bleb-related infections, and data for 2.5 years of follow-up result were summarized.The incidence and severity of bleb-related infection.Of the 908 eyes, 9 eyes developed a bleb-related infection. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that the probability of development of bleb-related infection was 1.5±0.6% (cumulative probability ± standard error) at the 2.5-year follow in the trabeculectomy cases and 1.4±1.0% in the combined surgery cases. It was 1.5% in both cases with a limbal-based flap and in those with a fornix-based flap. It was significantly different between cases with bleb leakage and those without it (P = 0.037; log-rank test).The cumulative probability of bleb-related infection was prospectively determined to be 1.5±0.6% in eyes treated with mitomycin C-augmented trabeculectomy or trabeculectomy combined with phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation at the 2.5-year follow-up in the Collaborative Bleb-related Infection Incidence and Treatment Study.",

Epithelial barrier function of the bleb conjunctiva and the cornea in the operated eye was evaluated using an Anterior Fluorometer FL-500 to measure the uptake of topically applied fluorescein.Fluorescein uptake (nanograms per milliliter, mean +/- standard error) by the bleb conjunctiva (1,857 +/- 380) was not significantly different from either the uptake by the superior bulbar conjunctiva in the operated eyes, located approximately 90 degrees C away from the filtering bleb (1,974 +/- 258), or the uptake by the conjunctiva in the intact eyes, located symmetrically against the bleb (1,913 +/- 248). The corneal uptake in the operated eye (56.1 +/- 10.2) was not significantly different from that in the intact eye (53.5 +/- 8.3).Epithelial barrier function of the cystic filtering bleb conjunctiva and the cornea long after trabeculectomy with mitomycin C was demonstrated to be almost identical to that of the control.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Inter-particle water infiltration dynamics of iron ore fines and concentrates was investigated using Washburn Capillary Rising method to evaluate the effect of various raw material conditions presented in the iron ore sintering process. The final water content and initial infiltration rate of the ores were determined from the measured infiltration curves and found to be heavily affected by the ore type and the blending, pre-wetting and packing conditions. The final water content of the ores was found to increase with the voidage of the packed ore bed. Ores forming a more permeable bed with a larger voidage is expected to achieve a higher final water content. The final water content of the blended ores showed an intermediate value between the component ores and can be readily predicted from the final water content of the component ores. Like the dry ore, the pre-wetted ore showed a similar infiltration curve. However, compared with the dry ore, the pre-wetted ore picked a considerably less amount of water at the end of infiltration test because some voidages were occupied by initial water. The initial infiltration rate of the ores was found to be greatly governed by the specific surface area, then bed voidage and contact angle. The Canadian magnetite concentrate showed the fastest initial infiltration rate of 3.0 × 10 -9  kg 2 /s likely due to its smallest specific surface area. On the other hand, the Brazilian ores consisting of micro-porous hematite measured the smallest infiltration rate of 3.2 × 10 -  10  kg 2 /s due to their largest specific surface area. Unlike the final water content, the initial infiltration rate of the blended ores cannot be readily calculated from the component ores due to the nonlinear relationship between the initial infiltration rate and specific surface area. Pre-wetting was believed to improve the wettability and connection of ores with infiltrated water, leading to a faster completion of infiltration.",

        "abstract": "For high-speed packet access, hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) multiplexing are indispensable techniques. Single-carrier (SC) MIMO block transmission using frequency-domain signal detection such as the frequency-domain linear detection based on the minimum mean square error criterion (MMSED) can improve the HARQ throughput performance over the frequency-selective fading channel. However, the performance improvement is limited due to not only an inter-antenna interference (IAI) but also an inter-symbol interference (ISI) resulting from a severe frequency-selective fading. In this paper, we propose to jointly use a training sequence (TS) aided SC block transmission and a near maximum likelihood (ML) block detection using QR decomposition and M-algorithm (QRM-MLBD) for SC-MIMO HARQ. It is shown, by computer simulation, that SC-MIMO using TS aided QRM-MLBD significantly improves the HARQ throughput performance compared to an often used cyclic prefix (CP) inserted SC-MIMO while significantly reducing the computational complexity. It is also shown that proposed TS aided QRM-MLBD achieves a significantly higher throughput than the MMSED particularly when higher level modulation is used.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To enhance the bending properties of carbon fiber-reinforced thermoplastics (CFRTPs) by improving their interfacial properties, a new colloidal technique has been developed in this work. First, colloidal polymer containing the main components of thermoplastic nylon resin was synthesized from nylon powder and surfactants or through emulsion polymerization and then subsequently adsorbed on the surface of carbon fibers by electrodeposition. The strength of the surface adhesion between the modified carbon fibers and nylon was estimated by measuring their interfacial shear strength (ISS) via fragmentation testing. The obtained results revealed that both the ISS and impregnation ratio of nylon depended on the amount and composition of the adsorbed particles. Furthermore, the relationship between the interfacial and bending properties of CFRTP was clarified. The data by three-point bending tests showed that the contribution of the impregnation ratio of nylon to the enhancement of the bending strength of CFRTP was much larger than that of ISS.",

The experimental classification performance was compared with the numerical calculation. Test particles used were pure silica particles with the mass median diameters of 3.5 and 2.5 μm. The effects of inlet flow rate, slurry concentration, applied electro-potential and the shape of inlet on the classification performance were also studied. The classification accuracy increased by applying the electro-potential and the cut size decreased with an increase in the electro-potential. The classification performance with a three-layer inlet was higher than that with a two-layer inlet. The experimental data agreed well with the numerical calculation. It is further shown that the 50% cut size was about 1 μm for a relatively short time, and the newly developed water elutriator is, therefore, effective for the classification of fine particles in slurries.

        "title": "Concomitant administration of radiation with eribulin improves the survival of mice harboring intracerebral glioblastoma.",
        "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most common and devastating type of malignant brain tumor. We recently found that eribulin suppresses glioma growth in vitro and in vivo and that eribulin is efficiently transferred into mouse brain tumors at a high concentration. Eribulin is a non-taxane microtubule inhibitor approved for breast cancer and liposarcoma. Cells arrested in M-phase by chemotherapeutic agents such as microtubule inhibitors are highly sensitive to radiation-induced DNA damage. Several recent case reports demonstrated the clinical benefits of eribulin combined with radiation therapy for metastatic brain tumors. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of a combined eribulin and radiation treatment on human glioblastoma cells. The glioblastoma cell lines U87MG, U251MG, U118MG, and SJ28 cells, a patient-derived sphere culture cell line, were used to determine the radiosensitizing effect of eribulin using western blotting, flow cytometry, and clonogenic assay. Subcutaneous and intracerebral glioma xenografts were generated in mice to assess the efficacy of the combined treatment. The combination of eribulin and radiation enhanced DNA damage in vitro. The clonogenic assay of U87MG demonstrated the radiosensitizing effect of eribulin. The concomitant eribulin and radiation treatment significantly prolonged the survival of mice harboring intracerebral glioma xenografts compared with eribulin or radiation alone (p<0.0001). In addition, maintenance administration of eribulin after the concomitant treatment further controlled brain tumor growth. Aberrant microvasculature was decreased in these tumors. Concomitant treatment with eribulin and radiation followed by maintenance administration of eribulin may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for glioblastomas.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Vertically aligned zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods (NRs) were grown on the ion-plated Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) seed layers by chemical bath deposition from the mixed aqueous solutions of zinc nitrate hexahydrate and hexamethylenetetramine using the deionized water with a low resistivity or that with a high resistivity. The difference in the resistivity of the deionized water resulted in the differences in both the growth rates along the length- and width-directions and the different growth time dependences of the morphological, residual stress and photoluminescence properties of the NRs. The dark current–voltage curves of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS)/ZnO NRs/ GZO heterostructures showed rectifying characteristics, suggesting the formation of Schottky junctions. It was found that the barrier height of the Schottky junction decreases with the increase in the growth time of the ZnO NRs layer. Moreover, the PEDOT:PSS/ZnO NRs/GZO heterostructures exhibited the photocurrent, which is effectively generated under the illumination of 360 nm UV light. The rise and decay times of the photocurrent were typically several seconds and several hundreds seconds, respectively. The observed photoconductive mechanism cannot be explained without the help of the change in the Schottky barrier height due to the adsorption and desorption of the oxygen molecules at the surface of the NRs.",

A stepwise regression analysis was performed to correlate the visual field damage progression, expressed as the mean deviation (MD) change per year, with several independent clinical factors including age, history of disc hemorrhage, initial MD, mean intraocular pressure (IOP), peak IOP, diurnal fluctuation of IOP, presence of a beta zone of peripapillary atrophy, and use of Ca(2+)-channel blockers.Statistical analysis revealed that non-use of Ca(2+)-channel blockers (P = 0.01), peripapillary atrophy (P = 0.03) and disc hemorrhage (P = 0.04) were associated with visual loss progression.Risk factors unrelated to IOP were suggested to be associated with progression of visual field loss. Systemic use of Ca(2+)-channel blockers has a favorable effect on visual field prognosis in NTG eyes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   We studied the effects of indium codoping on the moisture stability of 50- and 100-nm-thick Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) films grown at various oxygen gas flow rates (OFRs) by ion plating with direct-current arc discharge. The results of damp-heat tests at a temperature of 60 °C and a relative humidity of 95% for 500 h showed that, for 100-nm-thick GZO film with 0.75 wt% In 2 O 3  codoping (GZO:In) grown at an OFR of higher than 10 sccm, the relative change in resistivity (Δ ρ ) was greatly reduced to be less than 10%. Furthermore, Δ ρ  = 7.4% was achieved for 50-nm-thick GZO:In films grown at an OFR of 15 sccm. Δ ρ  is defined as Δ ρ  = 100%×| ρ - ρ  0 |/ ρ  0 , where  ρ  0  and  ρ  are electrical resistivities before and after the damp-heat tests, respectively. The low resistivity and high transparency of GZO films were retained by indium codoping. No phase segregation of Ga 2 O 3  and In 2 O 3  in the GZO:In films was observed by X-ray diffraction and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in scanning transmission electron microscopy. The water diffusion into GZO film during damp-heat test was blocked in GZO:In film grown at OFR = 15 sccm, which was directly observed by secondary ion mass spectroscopy. All these findings demonstrate that indium codoping is an effective method of improving the moisture stability of thin GZO film of thickness less than 100 nm. This is essential for applications including optoelectronic devices.",

        "abstract": "One-tap frequency-domain equalization (FDE) based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion is a powerful technique to improve the bit error rate (BER) performance of direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) signal transmission in a frequency-selective fading channel. However, the presence of the residual inter-chip interference (ICI) limits the improvement of the BER performance of DS-CDMA. In our previous paper, we proposed joint FDE and despreading which can simultaneously perform equalization and despreading in the frequency-domain to reduce the residual ICI. However, one-tap joint FDE and despreading can achieve only slightly better BER performance than the conventional one-tap MMSE-FDE. In this paper, we derive the MMSE weight of joint FDE and despreading for multi-code DS-CDMA by taking into account the totality of equalization errors at all frequency. We evaluate, by the computer simulation, the average BER performance and the BER performance of the multi-tap joint FDE and despreading using a new MMSE weight is compared with that of the conventional one-tap MMSE-FDE and the one-tap joint FDE and despreading.

        "abstract": "Probing and modeling of surface polarization phenomena originating from dipoles and electrons in organic materials are studied. We use an electrical measurement that can directly probe orientational dipolar motion in monolayers by Maxwell Displacement Current, and show that a two-dimensional domain shape is dependent on electrostatic energy stored in the domain owing to the polar orientational alignment of permanent dipoles. Also, we demonstrate a novel optical second harmonic generation technique that allows carrier motion in active layers of organic field-effect transistors to be directly probed as the migration of electric field. We conclude that probing of electric field generated from moving charged particles, e.g., dipoles and electrons, at the interface is a common concept for studying dielectric polarization and its related two-dimensional interfacial phenomena in organic materials.",

Dose response studies to IOP were performed after intravenous administration of alpha-hANP at 6.25, 12.5, 25.0, 50 and 100 micrograms/kg to the rabbits. The maximum reduction in IOP was observed to occur with the alpha-hANP 50 micrograms/kg dose. The time course of the pressure response to alpha-hANP were measured prior to and following intravenous administration of 50 micrograms/kg of alpha-hANP. The change in IOP and blood pressure showed the same pattern in the simultaneous record. Silver grains of 125I-alpha-hANP (10 microCi/g body weight) were detected in the ciliary processes of mice by radioautography after intravenous injection. The pupillary response was not tested in this experiment. The mechanism of IOP reduction was discussed.",

Because one of the advantages of MWCNTs compared to other preparation methods is high electrical conductivity, the electrical properties of the composite films were evaluated by the direct current two-terminal method. As a result, the composite film prepared by MWCNTs had conductive paths and showed higher conductivity even at lower mass fraction of MWCNTs compared with the previous works to keep transparency. This method was shown to decrease the mass fractions of MWCNTs and increase the transparency of the composite films.",

It significantly reduced the resistance index in the central retinal artery and posterior ciliary arteries, but not in the ophthalmic artery. The calculated ocular perfusion pressure was not affected.Oral nilvadipine reduces vascular resistance in distal retrobulbar arteries in normal-tension glaucoma without affecting more proximal blood vessels.

The association among variables, especially that between visual field defect and CCT, was probed by multivariate regression in eyes with NTG or POAG, and in all eyes. All eyes were divided into early, moderate, or severe visual field defect groups according to Anderson's classification. Statistical analysis was performed for all cases, and for the three CCT groups.Multivariate regression analysis revealed an association between CCT and visual field defect in eyes with NTG but not in eyes with POAG or in all eyes. The eyes with early visual field defect had greater CCT than did those with severe visual field defect (533.2 versus 519.0 microm). The eyes with greater CCT had better visual field indices than did those with thinner CCT (-6.91 versus -9.17 dB).Central corneal thickness is a factor associated with the status of the visual field defect: a greater CCT is associated with a better visual field index. Other factors such as the glaucoma subtype play a role in the effect of CCT on visual field defect.",
