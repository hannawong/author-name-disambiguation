XRD patterns indicate that Li y[Mn1-xMx]-O2 has the layered O2 structure with the hexagonal space group P3ml. It is shown by XRD that the structure of the Cr-doped precursors is influenced by the dopant content. When 0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.05, Na2/3[Mn1-xCrx]O2 materials with the P2 structure were obtained. When x > 0.05, the structure was gradually changed from P2 structure to orthorhombic Na4Mn 9O18. X-ray photoelectron spectra indicate that surface and bulk compositions of Liy[Mn0.95Cr0.05] O2 are different. The oxidation states of manganese and chromium in the near-surface region are largely tetravalent and the Cr/Mn ratio in the near-surface region is higher than that in the bulk. The presence of Mn 4+ and Cr-rich surface layers leads to an improvement in the stability of the material. In the case of the Mg-doped compounds, however, layered O2-type structure Liy[Mn1-xMgx]O 2 materials can be obtained in the range of 0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.15. The layered structure becomes more distinct as the content of Mg increases. The Mg/Mn ratio in the near-surface region is consistent with that in the bulk, indicating the formation of stoichiometric Mg-Mn mixed oxides.",

In this study, layered manganese oxide (\u03b4-K x MnO 2 ) has been synthesized by thermal decomposition of KMnO 4 , and four lithium manganese oxide phases have been synthesized for the first time by mild hydrothermal reactions of this material with different lithium compounds. The lithium manganese oxides were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma emission (ICPE) spectroscopy, and chemical redox titration. The four materials obtained are rock salt structure Li 2 MnO 3 , hollandite (BaMn 8 O 16 ) structure \u03b1-MnO 2 , spinel structure LiMn 2 O 4 , and birnessite structure Li x MnO 2 . Their electrochemical properties used as cathode material for secondary lithium batteries have been investigated. Of the four lithium manganese oxides, birnessite structure Li x MnO 2 demonstrated the most stable cycling behavior with high Coulombic efficiency. Its reversible capacity reaches 155 mAh g \u22121 , indicating that it is a viable cathode material for lithium secondary batteries.

        "abstract": "Layered double hydroxides (LDH) calcined within a certain temperature range (denoted as CLDH) have been shown to recover their original layered structure in the presence of appropriate anions. In the light of this so-called \"memory effect\", uptake of chloride ion from aqueous solution by calcined MgAl-CO3 LDH was investigated in batch mode. The equilibrium isotherm showed that the uptake of chloride ion by CLDH was consistent with the Langmuir and Freundlich equations and that the Langmuir model gave a better fit to the experimental data than the Freundlich model. The maximum uptake capacity of CLDH for chloride ion was 149.5 mg/g, close to the stoichiometric uptake (168 mg/g). The influence of varying pH of solution, initial chloride concentration, adsorbent quantity, and temperature on the kinetics of chloride removal has also been explored. Four kinetic models were used to fit the experimental data, and it was found that the pseudo-second-order kinetics model could be used to describe the uptake process satisfactorily. The calculated value of Ea was found to be 56.8 kJ/mol, which suggests that the process of uptake of chloride ion is controlled by the rate of reaction of chloride ion with the CLDH rather than diffusion. A mechanism for removal of chloride ion has been confirmed by X-ray diffraction, FT-IR spectroscopy and TG-MS measurements.",

Both XRD and ICP analysis demonstrate that temperature influences the rate of the ion exchange reaction and the crystal structure of LiMnO2 in each case. The higher the temperature, the faster the reaction, and the more severe the distortion of the products. SEM micrographs show that LiMnO2 possesses a needle-like morphology.",

        "title": "In situ FT-IR, in situ HT-XRD and TPDE study of thermal decomposition of sulfated \u03b2-cyclodextrin intercalated in layered double hydroxides",
        "abstract": "The thermal decomposition behavior of an intercalate derived from magnesium\u2013aluminum layered double hydroxide (Mg/Al LDH) and hexa-sulfated \u03b2-cyclodextrin [NaSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)] has been studied by in situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, in situ high temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD), temperature-programmed decomposition (TPDE), thermogravimetry (TG), and differential thermal analysis (DTA). In situ FT-IR shows that the decomposition of glucose groups of \u03b2-CD is complete at 230, 170 and 270 \u00b0C in NaSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6), HSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) and SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH, respectively, indicating that intercalation of the SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) anion into an LDH host can increase its thermal stability. In the hybrid compound SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH the - SO 3 - groups are gradually converted to SO 4 2 - which are grafted to the LDH layers. In situ XRD shows that there are two decreases in d 0 0 3 basal spacing of SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH observed in the temperature range 20\u2013150 \u00b0C and 200\u2013350 \u00b0C. The first corresponds to the destruction of the interlayer hydrogen bonding area and the second is attributed to the decomposition of SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) and dehydroxylation of the LDH layers. TPDE combined with GC-MS is used for the first time to study the thermal decomposition of LDHs, and the results are in accordance with those from in situ FT-IR, in situ XRD and TG-DTA. Keywords Sulfated \u03b2-cyclodextrin Layered double hydroxide Intercalation Thermal decomposition In situ FT-IR In situ HT-XRD TPDE 1 Introduction Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are a class of anionic clays which can be represented by the general formula [ M 1 - x II M x III ( OH ) 2 ] x + (A n \u2212 ) x / n \u00b7 m H 2 O [1] , where M II , M III are di- and tri-valent metal cations respectively. LDHs have positively charged layers and a wide variety of charge-balancing anionic species have been intercalated into the gallery region. As a result, LDHs are now well established as excellent anion-exchange materials and their extensive intercalation chemistry has widespread applications in areas such as heterogeneous catalysis [2,3] , separation science [4,5] . Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides of d -glucopyranose that possess a unique structure containing a non-polar doughnut-shaped ring which can accommodate different kinds of compounds in the cavity [6\u20139] . Cyclodextrins and their derivatives are excellent \u201chost\u201d components for the microencapsulation of a wide variety of organic, as well as inorganic guest molecules, forming host-guest inclusion complexes in aqueous solution [6] . In 1998, Zhao and Vance reported the intercalation of carboxymethyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin in LDHs as well as its sorption affinity for organic compounds [10,11] . Sulfated cyclodextrins have been widely used for enantiomeric separation, either by liquid chromatography using columns containing the materials bound to a solid support [12,13] or by capillary electrophoresis [14,15] . The intercalation of sulfated cyclodextrins in the confined interlayer region of LDHs should give rise to a new type of stationary phase for liquid chromatography with high chiral selectivity and low degree of leaching. In our previous paper [16] , a hexa sulfated \u03b2-cyclodextrin has been intercalated into a magnesium\u2013aluminum LDH, and its structure and chemical composition have been studied. Ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermal analysis have been generally used to investigate the decomposition process of LDHs [17\u201319] . Ex situ studies have the disadvantage that mixed oxides derived from LDHs may rehydrate and reconstruct to give the original structure at ambient temperature in air. In situ infrared spectroscopy has been used to provide structural information about the dehydroxylation and decarbonation process in LDHs [20\u201323] , and P\u00e9rez-Ram\u00edrez et al. have studied the thermal decomposition of Co-Al and Ni-Al hydrotalcites by in situ Fourier transform infrared and laser Raman spectroscopies [24] . Temperature-programmed decomposition (TPDE) [25] has been generally used for the study of catalysts and the decomposition of LDHs has not been studied using this method. In the present work, the thermal decomposition process of sulfated \u03b2-cyclodextrin intercalated LDH has been investigated by in situ FT-IR, in situ HT-XRD, TPDE and TG-DTA. To the best of our knowledge, combined application of in situ techniques to investigate the decomposition of organic molecule-intercalated LDHs has not been reported elsewhere. Therefore, this work provides information about the thermal decomposition of the cyclodextrin-LDH hybrid. An understanding of the thermal stability is important in view of its potential application on a novel stationary phase for liquid chromatography. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Reagents All reagents including Mg(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b7 6H 2 O, Al(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b7 9H 2 O, NaOH, NaNO 3 , Na 2 CO 3 , CaCO 3 , ethanol, ether, acetone, sulfuric acid and \u03b2-cyclodextrin were of analytical grade. \u03b2-cyclodextrin was purchased from Aldrich, and the others from Beijing Chemical Plant Limited. 2.2 Synthesis of hexa-sulfated \u03b2-cyclodextrin and SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH The sodium salt of hexa-sulfated \u03b2-cyclodextrin, NaSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6), was synthesized according to the procedure described in the literature [26] . HSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6), the acid form corresponding to protonated NaSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6), was obtained by recrystallization after adjusting the pH of the NaSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) solution. The precursor [Mg 4 Al 2 (OH) 12 ](NO 3 ) 2 \u00b7 4H 2 O (represented as Mg/Al-NO 3 LDH) was synthesized by a procedure similar to that described previously [1] . SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH was synthesized according to the procedure described in our previous paper [16] . 2.3 Characterization In situ HT-XRD measurements were performed on a Rigaku D/max 2500VB2+/PC diffractometer in vacuum, using CuK\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 0.154 nm) at 40 kV, 30 mA. The samples as unoriented powders were scanned in steps of 0.02\u00b0 in the 2 \u03b8 range 2\u00b0\u201370\u00b0 using a count time of 4 s per step. In situ FT-IR spectra were recorded using a Nicolet 60sxb spectrometer in the range 4000 to 400 cm \u22121 with 2 cm \u22121 resolution. The spectra were obtained every 10\u00b0 with a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C/min under the protection of a nitrogen atmosphere. The standard KBr disk method (1 mg of sample in 100 mg of KBr) was used. TPDE of the samples was carried out using an MRCS-2000 instrument under flowing helium in the temperature range 30\u2013500 \u00b0C with heating rate of 2 \u00b0C/min. The decomposition products were analyzed by GC-MS on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 instrument. Helium was used as carrier gas at flow rate of 0.92 ml/min. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure of SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH The X-ray diffraction patterns of the precursor Mg/Al-NO 3 LDH and the NaSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) intercalated LDH are shown in Fig. 1 . In each case, the reflections can be indexed to a hexagonal lattice with R -3m rhombohedral symmetry, commonly used for the description of the LDH structures. As shown in Fig. 1 a, the strongest peak of SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH is the (0 0 6) reflection, while the (0 0 3) reflection has the strongest peak intensity in the diffraction pattern of the LDH precursor. This is possibly related to the presence of a carbonate-containing LDH impurity phase which is often observed even when intercalation reactions are carried out under nitrogen. The peak around 11\u00b0 may be a superposition of the (0 0 3) reflection of the LDH-carbonate and the (0 0 6) reflection of SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH, accounting for its enhanced intensity. The peak around 23\u00b0 can be assigned to the (0 0 6) reflection of LDH-carbonate. This will be further discussed in the section of in situ HT-XRD below. Elemental analysis data show that the chemical composition of SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH is Mg 0.70 Al 0.34 (OH) 2 (SO 3 CD(6)) 0.05 (CO 3 ) 0.05 (NO 3 ) 0.01 \u00b7 0.04H 2 O. It can be seen that not all of the NO 3 - anions have been exchanged by SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6), which has been observed by other authors in studies of intercalation of large anions in Mg/Al-NO 3 LDH precursors [27,28] . Some carbonate containing LDH coexists with the SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH, which is consistent with the XRD results. The total exclusion of carbonate from the interlayer space of LDHs is known to be difficult, which can be readily explained on the basis of the favorable lattice stabilization enthalpy associated with the small and highly charged CO 3 2 - anions [29] . 3.2 Thermal decomposition by in situ FT-IR Infrared spectra recorded during the decomposition of NaSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6), HSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6), SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH in the temperature range 24\u2013450 \u00b0C are presented in Figs. 2\u20134 , respectively. NaSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) and HSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) were used as reference samples here. 3.2.1 Analysis of as-synthesized samples As shown in Fig. 2 , in the infrared spectrum at room temperature of the as-synthesized NaSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6), a broad strong absorption band at 3427 cm \u22121 is observed, which can be attributed to OH combination stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups and physically adsorbed water [30] . An absorption at 2923 cm \u22121 is due to the stretching vibration of CH 2 , and that at 1659 cm \u22121 is due to HOH bending of physically adsorbed water. Bands at 1159, 1027 and 943 cm \u22121 are assigned to absorption of C\u2013O, C\u2013O\u2013C of glucose units and C\u2013O\u2013C of the rings respectively [31] , while those at 1267 and 1059 cm \u22121 are attributed to asymmetric stretching vibrations of SO 2 and S\u2013O respectively [32] . Fig. 3 displays the infrared spectra of HSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6), the acid form corresponding to protonated NaSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6). Its spectrum at room temperature is in accordance with that of NaSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) except that the position of the absorption band attributed to SO 2 decreases from 1267 ( Fig. 5 a) to 1252 cm \u22121 ( Fig. 5 b). This is related to the formation of an O-H bond in HSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6), bringing about the shift to low frequency of the asymmetric stretching vibration of SO 2 compared with that of NaSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6). The infrared spectrum at room temperature of SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH is shown in Fig. 4 . The very broad absorption band centered at 3467 cm \u22121 is assigned to the OH stretching vibration of hydroxyl groups, water molecules in the interlayer and physically adsorbed water [30] . The OH group of SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) and that of the LDH layers form a strong hydrogen bond resulting in a shift of the OH band to high frequency compared with NaSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) (3427 cm \u22121 ) and HSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) (3424 cm \u22121 ). The band at 1640 cm \u22121 is due to HOH bending of physically adsorbed water and bands at 1155, 1027 and 942 cm \u22121 correspond to absorption by C\u2013O, C\u2013O\u2013C of glucose units and C\u2013O\u2013C of rings respectively. The lattice vibrations of metal cations Al 3+ and Mg 2+ can be seen at 826 and 668 cm \u22121 [33] . The bands at 1383 and 1385 cm \u22121 are due to the stretching vibrations of NO 3 - and CO 3 2 - [19,34] . The co-intercalation of these anions along with SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) is also shown by XRD and elemental analysis [16] . The bands at 1059 and 1254 cm \u22121 are attributed to the stretching vibrations of C\u2013O\u2013S and SO 2 respectively. Compared with NaSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6), the stretching vibration of SO 2 in SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH moves 13 cm \u22121 to low frequency. This may indicate the different strengths of hydrogen bonding, which is weaker in the sodium salt precursor ( Fig. 5 a) and higher in the interlayer region of SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH ( Fig. 5 c). 3.2.2 Thermal decomposition monitored by in situ FT-IR From Fig. 2 , it can be observed that the absorption bands at 1159, 1027, 943, 2923 and 3427 cm \u22121 attributed to the C\u2013O, C\u2013O\u2013C of glucose units, C\u2013O\u2013C rings, CH 2 and OH groups respectively [31] , become weaker on increasing the temperature from 24 to 200 \u00b0C, and disappear at 230 \u00b0C. This indicates that the decomposition of NaSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) involves dehydroxylation and the breaking of C\u2013O\u2013C bands both within and between glucose units. The changes in the position of the band centered at 1267 cm \u22121 which is attributed to the asymmetric stretching of SO 2 [35] , are very interesting. When the temperature increases to 200 \u00b0C, the absorbance of SO 2 moves from 1267 to 1225 cm \u22121 , while it shifts in the reverse direction to 1253 cm \u22121 in the temperature range 200\u2013270 \u00b0C. This variation is possibly related to the formation of hydrogen bonds between \u2013 SO 3 - and OH. At lower temperatures, \u2013 SO 3 - and OH cannot form hydrogen bonds or the hydrogen bonds formed are very weak due to the space restriction. However with increasing temperature, OH is released from the glucose moieties, and it is possible for \u2013 SO 3 - and free OH to form hydrogen bonds which reach a maximum at 200 \u00b0C. As a result, the band moves to low frequency, and the frequency reaches a minimum at 200 \u00b0C. With the continuous loss of the free OH groups between 200 and 270 \u00b0C, the wavenumber of the absorption band of SO 2 increases to 1253 cm \u22121 because of breaking of hydrogen bonds. At 270 \u00b0C, the band at 1253 cm \u22121 becomes very weak and a new band at 1103 cm \u22121 appears. When the temperature is above 300 \u00b0C, the band at 1254 cm \u22121 becomes insignificant, while strong bands at 1104 and 611 cm \u22121 appear. These changes confirm that SO 3 - groups are eventually converted to SO 4 2 - . As SO 4 2 - has a tetrahedral structure, only symmetric stretching (1105 cm \u22121 ) and out-of-plane deformation (611 cm \u22121 ) bands are IR-active [35] . Fig. 3 shows the in situ variable temperature FT-IR spectra of HSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6). The bands at 3424 and 2927 cm \u22121 due to hydroxyl groups and CH 2 groups respectively become weaker with increasing temperature and disappear at 200 \u00b0C. Bands at 1157, 1024 and 940 cm \u22121 attributed to glucose units disappear at 170 \u00b0C, as compared with 230 \u00b0C for NaSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) ( Fig. 2 ). The characteristic absorption bands of SO 4 2 - at 1100 and 611 cm \u22121 are observed at 250 \u00b0C, indicating the transformation of \u2013 SO 3 - groups to SO 4 2 - . The decomposition temperature of HSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) is lower than that of NaSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6), indicating lower thermal stability of the free acid compared with its salt. As shown in Fig. 4 , infrared spectra of SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH recorded at higher temperatures follow a similar trend as that observed for the two reference samples. However, there are some differences between them. The absorption band at 3467 cm \u22121 becomes weaker with increasing temperature, and disappears at 450 \u00b0C, as a result of loss of water as well as hydroxyl groups of \u03b2-CD and the LDH layers. The decrease in intensities of the absorption bands arising from the glucose units and SO 2 groups is insignificant in the temperature range 24\u2013200 \u00b0C, while there is a sharp decrease at 250 \u00b0C, and the bands completely disappear at 270 \u00b0C. From 24\u2013200 \u00b0C, the intercalated SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) is located in a restricted interlayer region with water of crystallization occupying the free space. As a result, its rate of decomposition is rather slow, which is possibly a result of limitations imposed on the diffusion of the interlayer guests. When the temperature is above 200 \u00b0C, the loss of interlayer water is almost complete and dehydroxylation occurs. Therefore, there is more free interlayer space in the LDH, and the diffusion process is not the rate-determining step of the decomposition of intercalated SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6). Consequently, decomposition occurs rapidly during the temperature range 200\u2013250 \u00b0C, and is complete at 270 \u00b0C. The variation in the bands at 1383 and 1385 cm \u22121 attributed to interlayer NO 3 - and CO 3 2 - follows a similar pattern and the bands almost disappear at 250 \u00b0C, in accordance with the analysis of in situ XRD which will be further discussed below. Moreover, at 150 \u00b0C there is a new peak observed at 1107 cm \u22121 , which is assigned to the absorption of SO 4 2 - as previously discussed. It becomes stronger with increasing temperature, and shifts to 1104 cm \u22121 at 250 \u00b0C. However, a doublet at 1147 and 1109 cm \u22121 appears at 270 \u00b0C. The former band becomes stronger and the latter becomes weaker with the increase of temperature. Only a broad band centered at 1140 cm \u22121 is observed above 400 \u00b0C, which may be assigned to SO 4 2 - grafted to the LDH layers (as shown in Fig. 5 d). Constantino and Pinnavaia reported that grafting of sulfate to adjacent LDH layers occurs above 250 \u00b0C [36] , and the absorption band of grafted SO 4 2 - (1147 cm \u22121 ) was observed at 270 \u00b0C in our study, in agreement with their results. 3.3 Thermal decomposition monitored by in situ HT-XRD The in situ HT-XRD patterns of the intercalation product SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH in the temperature range 20\u2013700 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 6 . The variations in the d 0 0 3 basal spacing of SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH and CO 3 2 - /LDH with temperature are shown in Fig. 7 a and b, respectively. At 20 \u00b0C, the strongest peak (see Fig. 6 ) of SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH is the (0 0 6) reflection (2 \u03b8 11\u00b0), which may be a superposition of the (0 0 3) reflection of CO 3 2 - /LDH and the (0 0 6) reflection of SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH, accounting for its enhanced intensity. The peak around 23\u00b0 (marked with \u25a0) can be assigned to the (0 0 6) reflection of CO 3 2 - LDH. This will be discussed further below. When heated to 150 \u00b0C, the (0 0 3), (0 0 6) and (0 0 9) diffraction peaks of SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH clearly move to higher angle 2 \u03b8 (as shown in Fig. 6 ) with the (0 0 3) basal spacing decreasing from 1.618 to 1.406 nm ( Fig. 7 a). The (0 0 6) peak of SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH (marked with * in Fig. 6 ) and (0 0 3) peak of CO 3 2 - LDH (marked with # in Fig. 6 ), which overlap at room temperature, are separated at 100 \u00b0C. This change probably results from the destruction of the interlayer hydrogen bonding area [34] in SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH associated with the loss of gallery water. Taking into account the decrease in d 0 0 3 basal spacing between 20 and 150 \u00b0C, the height of the interlayer hydrogen bonding area is calculated to be 0.212 nm (1.618\u20131.406 nm), which is close to the literature value of 0.27 nm [37] . The value of d 0 0 3 basal spacing is almost constant in the temperature range 150\u2013200 \u00b0C, while it decreases from 1.402 nm at 200 \u00b0C to 1.140 nm at 350 \u00b0C. The layered structure is lost at 400 \u00b0C (see Fig. 6 ). These changes result from the decomposition of SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) and dehydroxylation of LDH layers, and are in accordance with the in situ FT-IR analysis where it was shown that SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) is converted to grafted SO 4 2 - at 400 \u00b0C. For the interlayer impurity phase CO 3 2 - /LDH, its (0 0 3) diffraction peak (marked with # in Fig. 6 ) is clearly observed at 100 \u00b0C due to the shift in position of the (0 0 6) peak of the SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH phase, which was previously coincident with it. It can be seen from Fig. 7 b that the change in d 0 0 3 basal spacing of CO 3 2 - LDH is negligible in the range 20\u2013200 \u00b0C, in contrast to that of the SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH phase. This is possibly related to the different hydrogen bonded network, existing in the two materials. However, both the (0 0 3) and (0 0 6) peaks of the CO 3 2 - phase disappear at 230 \u00b0C, indicating completely decarbonation which is consisted with the results from in situ FT-IR spectroscopy at 250 \u00b0C. 3.4 Thermal decomposition studied by TPDE TPDE can be used to study the kinetics of adsorbate desorption, decomposition, surface catalysed reactions of adsorbates and a reactive gas in the carrier gas stream as well as reaction between co-adsorbates [38] . This technique is commonly applied in surface science and catalysis to determine surface coverage of adsorbates and to determine adsorption energies [39] . However, it has not previously been used to study the decomposition of LDHs. In this study, TPDE together with GC-MS were used to determine the intermediates formed during thermal reaction of SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH, and hence, the reaction pathway can be deduced. The TPDE profile ( Fig. 8 ) displays three decomposition peaks at 118, 166 and 378 \u00b0C. The first peak at 118 \u00b0C is due to the loss of physically absorbed water, as shown by the H 2 O detected by GC-MS. The second peak observed at 166 \u00b0C can be attributed to the loss of interlayer crystal water, as H 2 O was also detected by GC-MS. At the same time, some small organic fragments with molecular weight 32, 43 and 57 were detected by GC-MS at around 250 \u00b0C, which suggests that the interlayer SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) has begun to decompose. These organic fragments and water molecules coexist, so a broad peak between 166 and 300 \u00b0C was observed in the TPDE profile. In the temperature range 350\u2013450 \u00b0C, organic fragments with molecular weight 32, 43, 57 and 71 were detected, suggesting that this process corresponds to further decomposition of the guests as well as the dehydroxylation of the host layers. 3.5 TG-DTA analysis The TG and DTA curves for the SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH intercalate are shown in Fig. 9 . The thermal decomposition of SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH is characterized by four weight loss steps ( Fig. 9 a): the first (20\u2013130 \u00b0C) is due to loss of both adsorbed water and interlayer water molecules which is confirmed by in situ XRD pattern at 100 \u00b0C ( Fig. 6 ); the second (130\u2013250 \u00b0C) is a consequence of both the decomposition of the SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) and the elimination of interlayer water, which has a corresponding broad weak exothermic peak in the DTA curve ( Fig. 9 b), in accordance with the above analysis of the in situ FT-IR ( Fig. 4 ) and TPDE data; the third (250\u2013540 \u00b0C) can be attributed to dehydroxylation and decomposition of SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6). The fourth stage (620\u2013670 \u00b0C) can be attributed to the combustion of SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6), with a corresponding strong exothermic peak at 665 \u00b0C in the DTA curve ( Fig. 9 b). It should be noted that the fourth stage (combustion) was not observed by TPDE, since helium was used as the carrier gas. 4 Conclusions In situ FT-IR, in situ HT-XRD, TPDE and TG-DTA have been used to study physicochemical changes during the thermal decomposition of SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH. As shown by infrared spectroscopy, the asymmetric stretching vibration of SO 2 is at 1267, 1252 and 1254 cm \u22121 in NaSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6), HSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) and SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH, respectively. Hydrogen bonding in the last two compounds results in the red-shift of the absorption of SO 2 groups compared with NaSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6). In situ infrared spectra at high temperature reveal significant differences between these compounds. The decomposition of glucose groups of \u03b2-CD is complete at 230, 170 and 270 \u00b0C in NaSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6), HSO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) and SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH, respectively, indicating that intercalation of the SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) anion into an LDH host can increase its thermal stability. The decomposition of glucose groups in the range 24\u2013200 \u00b0C is much lower in the intercalate than in the sodium salt form, but its decomposition occurs rapidly between 200 and 250 \u00b0C, and is complete at 270 \u00b0C. This is possibly because interlayer diffusion is the rate-determining step in the former temperature region. It has been confirmed by in situ FT-IR spectroscopy that \u2013 SO 3 - is gradually converted to SO 4 2 - during the decomposition of all three compounds, and the temperatures at which SO 4 2 - is produced are different from each other. In the hybrid compound SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH, sulfate grafting between LDH layers first appears at 270 \u00b0C and is exclusively present above 400 \u00b0C. In situ HT-XRD was used to analyze the structural changes in SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH from 20 to 700 \u00b0C. The (0 0 6) peak of the SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH phase shifts relative to the (0 0 3) peak of the CO 3 2 - /LDH phase at 100 \u00b0C, due to the destruction of the hydrogen bonding area brought about by the removal of interlayer water. Both the (0 0 3) and (0 0 6) peaks of the CO 3 2 - /LDH phase disappear at 230 \u00b0C, indicating complete decarbonation which has been confirmed by in situ FT-IR spectroscopy at 250 \u00b0C. There are two observed decreases in d 0 0 3 basal spacing of SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH in the temperature range 20\u2013150 \u00b0C and 200\u2013350 \u00b0C. The first corresponds to the destruction of the interlayer hydrogen bonding area and the second is attributed to the decomposition of SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) anion and dehydroxylation of the LDH layers. The SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH phase disappears at 400 \u00b0C, which is in accordance with the analysis of the in situ FT-IR spectra where it is seen that SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6) is converted to grafted SO 4 2 - at the same temperature. TPDE combined with GC-MS was used to study the decomposition process of the SO 3 -\u03b2-CD(6)/LDH. There are three strong peaks corresponding to the loss of adsorbed water, crystal water and decomposition of guest species, followed by further decomposition of guest species and finally the dehydroxylation of the host layers. The results are in accordance with those of TG-DTA analysis, except that the combustion of guest species observed in the TG-DTA was not observed in TPDE because of the inert atmosphere system employed in the latter. Despite the great versatility of modified cyclodextrins for chiral analyis using GC [13,40] , only a few are currently available as immobilized derivatives, the most common being Chirasil-\u03b2-Dex in which a permethylated \u03b2-cyclodextrin is immobilized on a polysiloxane support [40] . Immobilization is desirable in order to combine chemical selectivity with chromatographic efficiency, and increase the thermal stability thus extending the temperature range of operation. Our results show that combining sulfated cyclodextrins with the cationic layers of LDHs represents a potential route to a new type of stationary phase for chiral analysis.

        "abstract": "Mn x V 2 O 5 \u00b7 n H 2 O containing double sheets of V 2 O 5 layers has been synthesized by a new method \u2013 oxidation of VOSO 4 with layered MnO 2 . The Mn/V molar ratio is 0.068, and XPS indicates that the oxidation state of vanadium is +5 and that of manganese is +4. Mn x V 2 O 5 \u00b7 n H 2 O has relatively promising lithium insertion properties, with a specific capacity of 200 mA h g \u22121 between 2.0 and 4.0 V, with the discharge capacity at the 18th cycle remaining as high as 208.3 mA h g \u22121 . Mn x V 2 O 5 \u00b7 n H 2 O is therefore a potential practical candidate as the cathode material for rechargeable lithium batteries. Keywords Manganese vanadium oxide Oxidation Cathode material Lithium secondary battery Electrochemical behavior 1 Introduction There is much interest in manganese and vanadium oxides for use as cathode materials for advanced lithium batteries to replace the expensive and relatively low capacity lithium cobalt oxide system [1] . The use of so called 4-V cathodes which have voltage plateaus near 4 V demands a high electrochemical stability of the electrolyte. For liquid electrolytes, even the best candidate is not very stable at elevated temperatures and this leads to a gradual capacity loss when LiMn 2 O 4 is used as the 4-V cathode [2] . Cathodes such as LiMnO 2 , V 2 O 5 , and V 6 O 13 have voltage plateaus near 3 V and are called 3-V cathodes [2] . Despite their low voltage, 3-V cathodes usually have larger charge capacities, and therefore their energy storage densities are comparable to 4-V cathodes. Reversible lithium intercalation in vanadium pentoxide was first studied by Whittingham [3] , and vanadium-oxide-based materials have been studied extensively for use as cathodes in recent years. Many vanadium-oxide compounds are easy to synthesize, have acceptable production costs, and have good lithium capacity. The primary disadvantage is their poor cycle life [4] . A variety of synthetic methods have been used for vanadium oxide preparation including the gel method and various modifications there-of [5\u201310] , method based on ozone oxidation [11] , electrophoretic deposition [12] , r.f. sputtering [13] , film sputtering by physical vaporization [14] , and hydrothermal methods [15\u201317] . In recent years, considerable attention has been paid to a comparison of the properties of amorphous and crystalline samples of vanadium oxide [18\u201320] , as well as to the identification of phase transitions during the Li intercalation/deintercalation process [21\u201323] . Wiesener et al. [23] have demonstrated that the Li-ion chemical diffusion coefficient D is higher for an amorphous vanadium oxide cathode than for a crystalline one, resulting in a variation in lithium insertion capacity when used in lithium batteries. It has been shown that a V 2 O 5 xerogel [24] has a high capacity of about 340 mA h g \u22121 , while the capacity of a crystalline form is only about 150 mA h g \u22121 [16,17] . Several studies have demonstrated that the introduction of manganese ions between vanadium oxide layers can increase the number of possible lithium intercalation\u2013deintercalation cycles. For example, reaction of KMnO 4 with VOSO 4 affords K 0.16 Mn 0. 04 V 2 O 4.94 \u00b7 0.14H 2 O [25] while reaction of N(CH 3 ) 4 MnO 4 with V 2 O 5 gives [17] materials of the type \u03b4-[N(CH 3 ) 4 ] z Mn y V 2 O 5 \u00b7 n H 2 O, both of which contain two types of interlayer cations. We were interested to prepare related material where manganese is the only interlayer cation and in this paper we report a simple synthesis of Mn x V 2 O 5 \u00b7 n H 2 O by oxidation of VOSO 4 with layered \u03b4-MnO 2 . The structure of the product has been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), FT-IR spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and its performance as a cathode material in lithium secondary batteries has been examined. 2 Experimental \u03b4-MnO 2 was obtained by thermal decomposition of KMnO 4 , followed by extraction of interlayer K + ions by acid treatment [26] . \u03b4-MnO 2 (3.0 g, 0.034 mol) was added to a solution of VOSO 4 (9.8 g, 0.06 mol) in water (200 mL), and the reaction was accelerated by addition of sulfuric acid (93%, 1.5 mL). The mixture was stirred for 4 days at room temperature and then filtered. The resulting dark brown solid was washed well with water. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer in the range 3\u2a7d2 \u03b8 \u2a7d70\u00b0 using a monochromatized Cu K\u03b1 radiation source ( \u03bb =1.5406 \u00c5). Elemental analysis was performed by inductively coupled plasma emission (ICP) spectroscopy using a Shimadzu ICPS-7500 instrument. It gave the composition of the product by weight as follows: V 46.02% and Mn 3.41%. On TGA, this material lost 12.44% of its weight by 400 \u00b0C, which suggesting about 1.53 mol H 2 O per mol of Mn x V 2 O 5 . Sample morphology was investigated using a Hitachi H-800 transmission electron microscope. FT-IR spectra were recorded using the KBr pellet technique with a Bruker Vector-22 spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were collected using a Thermo VG Sigma Probe X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a Mg K\u03b1 X-ray source (200 W). In order to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the material, composite electrodes were formed by mixing the active material with acetylene black and polytetrafluoroethylene in the weight ratio 88.5/5/7.5, and then pressing into pellets. The composite electrodes were dried at 120 \u00b0C in vacuum for 24 h before use. Button-type cells were assembled in a dry box. A cell was prepared by assembling the cathode, separator, and the anode in a sandwich structure. The anode was lithium metal and the electrolyte was a 1 M solution of LiClO 4 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC)/diethyl carbonate (DEC) in the volume ratio 1/1. The galvanostatic charge\u2013discharge cycle was performed using a PCBT-64 cycle life tester and the cyclic voltammogram obtained at a scan rate of 0.1 mV/s using a Zahner IM6 electrochemical workstation. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure and composition of the layered manganese\u2013vanadium oxide The powder XRD patterns of \u03b4-MnO 2 and the product obtained by reaction with VOSO 4 are shown in Fig. 1 . The reflections of \u03b4-MnO 2 ( Fig. 1(a) ) can be indexed on a simple three-block cell commonly used for the description of layered manganese oxides. The XRD pattern of the product is similar to those of \u03c3-Zn 0.25 V 2 O 5 [15] and M x V 2 O 5 A y \u00b7 n H 2 O [4] . A single crystal study of the former has shown that the structure is a double sheet type composed of two V 2 O 5 sheets facing each other. We therefore propose that the product of the reaction of \u03b4-MnO 2 with VOSO 4 is Mn x V 2 O 5 \u00b7 n H 2 O with an analogous structure. The interlayer spacing is 1.07 nm, the same as that observed for \u03c3-Zn 0.25 V 2 O 5 [15] . Elemental analysis of the product is consistent with the stoichiometry Mn 0.14 V 2 O 5.27 \u00b7 1.53H 2 O. Transmission electron micrographs ( Fig. 2 ) show that the manganese vanadium oxide was precipitated as a poorly crystalline material with an irregular plate-like appearance. The particle thickness is about 100\u2013200 nm, which is consistent with the weak, broad basal diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern. Using the Scherrer equation, the average thickness of the platelets was estimated to be 12 nm. The FT-IR spectra for \u03b4-MnO 2 and the product Mn x V 2 O 5 \u00b7 n H 2 O are shown in Fig. 3 . Broad absorption peaks in the region 3200\u20133700 cm \u22121 can be assigned to O\u2013H group stretching vibrations of the interlayer water molecules. A peak due to Mn\u2013O vibrations was observed at 920 cm \u22121 in both the spectra of \u03b4-MnO 2 and Mn x V 2 O 5 \u00b7 n H 2 O, conforming the presence of Mn\u2013O moieties in the product. As shown in Fig. 3(b) , additional peaks were found at 1008, 764 and 510 cm \u22121 in the spectrum of Mn x V 2 O 5 \u00b7 n H 2 O. The band at 1008 cm \u22121 is due to the V\ue605O stretching vibration [16] , and bands at 764 and 510 cm \u22121 are associated with the vanadium oxide network [16,17] . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy can provide chemical information about the oxidation state of elements present, as well as the semi-quantitative composition of the surface, and is thus a very useful method of studying surface conditions. Fig. 4 shows the XPS profiles of Mn x V 2 O 5 \u00b7 n H 2 O in the manganese (635\u2013660 eV) and vanadium\u2013oxygen regions (510\u2013545 eV). The binding energy of Mn 2p 3/2 is 642.0 eV, which indicates that the predominant Mn species present is Mn 4+ [27] . Compared with other signals, V 2p 3/2 is more sensitive to changes in oxidation state. The binding energy of V 2p 3/2 is at 517.9 eV, very close to that for V 5+ in V 2 O 5 . The O 1s peak at 530.8 eV also corresponds closely to that reported for V 2 O 5 [28] . Moreover, the O 1s peak shows a tail towards higher binding energy, similar to that observed for MnO 2 [29] , possibly resulting from interaction of Mn 4+ with H 2 O [28] . Oxidation states of Mn 4+ and V 5+ are both consistent with the analytical formula Mn 0.14 V 2 O 5.27 \u00b7 1.53H 2 O determined by elemental analysis (see above). XPS measurements using a semi-quantitative method [29] show that the molar ratio of Mn/V/O near the surface was 0.122/2.00/7.75. It can be seen that there is some surface contamination by oxygen, which may be related to the atmospheric present environment during measurement. The molar ratio Mn/V=0.061, is very close to the result obtained by ICP (Mn/V=0.068). This indicates that the composition near the surface is almost the same as that in the bulk. The low content of manganese in the sample indicates that most of the MnO 2 oxidant was reduced to soluble Mn 2+ species during the preparation of Mn x V 2 O 5 \u00b7 n H 2 O and was removed by washing. The remaining manganese(IV) is possibly situated in the vanadium oxide bronze layers on the basis of its +4 oxygen state and the Mn\u2013O absorption peak in its IR spectrum. 3.2 Electrochemical performance of Mn x V 2 O 5 \u00b7 n H 2 O Selected charging and discharging curves over the first 15 cycles with Mn x V 2 O 5 \u00b7 n H 2 O as cathode material in a lithium secondary battery are shown in Fig. 5 . The compound has an initial electromotive force (EMF) of 3.68 V, and 1.68 mol lithium per mol V 2 O 5 active material is incorporated into the structure on the first discharge. On recharge the capacity is 184.4 mA h g \u22121 , indicating that more than 90% of the lithium inserted into the structure can be removed below 4.0 V. As shown in Fig. 6 , the charge and discharge capacities remain essentially constant over 18 cycles, indicating the relatively stable and reversible electrochemical properties of this layered vanadium oxide. K 0.16 Mn 0.04 V 2 O 4.94 \u00b7 0.14H 2 O [25] obtained by hydrothermal reaction of KMnO 4 and VOSO 4 has a reversible capacity value of 190 mA h g \u22121 and a good capacity retention that is close to ours. TMA z Fe y V 2 O 5\u00b1\u03b4 \u00b7 n H 2 O [16] crystalline has a good reversibility of the redox reaction in a lithium battery with a low capacity (0.88 mol Li per mol TMA z Fe y V 2 O 5\u00b1\u03b4 ). In our work, Mn x V 2 O 5 \u00b7 n H 2 O has a higher reversible capacity and comparable cycling behavior to those reported in the literature. Fig. 7 shows the first four cyclic voltammograms obtained at a scan rate of 0.1 mV/s for the Mn x V 2 O 5 \u00b7 n H 2 O electrode. Two pairs of well defined reduction and oxidation peaks are observed in the range 4.0\u20132.0 V, which is very similar to that reported by Shembel et al. [18] for ESVO. As shown in Fig. 7 , the voltammogram for Mn x V 2 O 5 \u00b7 n H 2 O shows two reduction peaks at 2.90 and 2.25 V during the first scan, while in the second scan both peaks shift to higher potential (3.10 and 2.40 V, respectively). The voltammetric behavior of the layered Mn x V 2 O 5 \u00b7 n H 2 O may indicate that the process of lithium insertion is accompanied by some phase rearrangement since changes in the position and profile of the peaks can be correlated with structural modifications in the layered host. In further cycles, two stable reduction and oxidation peaks appear, respectively, at 2.40/2.85 and 3.15/3.35 V, which indicates that two reversible redox reactions occur during charging and discharging processes. The peaks in the voltammogram for the lithium intercalation electrode are associated with different lithium occupation sites and the oxidation-reduction of vanadium ions. Furthermore, it should be noted that for the Mn x V 2 O 5 \u00b7 n H 2 O material, primary lithium insertion does not induce an irreversible structure modification like that observed in V 2 O 5 [30] . For polycrystalline orthorhombic V 2 O 5 , the irreversible structural alterations are attributed to phase transition and/or phase segregation that reduces the specific capacity when the intercalation goes beyond x =1 in Li x V 2 O 5 [31] . However, this phenomenon has not been observed in the layered vanadium oxide Mn x V 2 O 5 \u00b7 n H 2 O in this work. This suggests that Mn x V 2 O 5 \u00b7 n H 2 O is a potential practical candidate as the cathode material for rechargeable lithium batteries. 4 Conclusions Mn x V 2 O 5 \u00b7 n H 2 O was synthesized by a new method \u2013 oxidation of VOSO 4 with layered MnO 2 . Characterization by XRD indicates that the Mn x V 2 O 5 \u00b7 n H 2 O has a layered structure, and can be indexed on the monoclinic system. Water molecules reside between double sheets of vanadium oxide. IR and XPS spectra indicate that Mn\u2013O bonds exist in the sample and the oxidation state of the manganese is +4. Analysis by XPS and ICP shows very similar Mn/V molar ratios. The electrochemical behavior of Mn x V 2 O 5 \u00b7 n H 2 O as a cathode material in lithium secondary batteries shows that this material exhibits high charge and discharge capacities of over 200 mA h g \u22121 between 2.0 and 4.0 V and excellent cycling stability with a discharge capacity of 208.3 mA h g \u22121 after 18 cycles. Cyclic voltammograms show that lithium intercalation/deintercalation processes are reversible. Acknowledgements This project was supported by the 863 Foundation of China (2001AA323020).

In this study, naproxen has been intercalated into Mg\u2013Al layered double hydroxide by the methods of ion exchange. The structure and composition of the intercalated material have been studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV\u2013vis spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy. A schematic model has been proposed. Furthermore, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, in situ high-temperature XRD, and thermogravimetry (TG) have been used to characterize the thermal decomposition of the hybrid material.

        "abstract": "A fundamental investigation on the uptake of bromide ion from contaminated water by calcined and uncalcined MgAl-CO3 layered double hydroxides (LDHs) were conducted in batch mode. The uptake capacity of calcined LDHs (CLDH) is higher than that of uncalcined LDHs, due to their different mechanisms which are confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction, FT-IR spectroscopy and TG-MS measurements. The former mechanism is based on the reconstruction of CLDH to Br-LDHs, whilst the latter is related to the surface adsorption. It has been found that the LDHs calcined at 500 degrees C with Mg/Al molar ratio of 4 represents the highest capacity to remove bromide ion from aqueous solution. The equilibrium isotherms of uptake of bromide by CLDH were well fitted by the Langmuir equation, and thermodynamic parameters such as Delta G0, Delta H0 and Delta S0 were calculated from Langmuir constants. The negative value of Delta H0 confirms the exothermic nature of adsorption. Three kinetics models were used to fit the kinetics experimental data, and it was found that the pseudo-second order kinetics model could be used to describe the uptake process appropriately. The value of Ea was calculated to be 79.9 kJ/mol, which suggests that the process of uptake bromide is controlled by the reaction rate of bromide with the CLDH rather than diffusion.",

        "abstract": "Layered double hydroxides (LDH) calcined at different temperatures (denoted as CLDH) have been demonstrated to recover their original layered structure in the presence of appropriate anions. In the light of this so-called \"memory effect\", a study of removal of fluoride from aqueous solution by calcined Mg-Al-CO(3)-LDH has been carried out. The LDH calcined at 500 degrees C had the highest capacity of removal of fluoride ion, because of retention of its intrinsic structure. The CLDH with an Mg/Al ratio of 2 has a remarkable ability to adsorb anions. The adsorption loading is higher for the calcined Mg-Al-LDH than for calcined Zn-Al and Ni-Al-LDH. The influence of varying the conditions for removal of fluoride, such as the pH of aqueous solution, the initial fluoride concentration, the dosage of adsorbent, and temperature on removal of fluoride have been investigated. The influence of co-existing anions in fluoride aqueous solution indicates that the percentage of removal of fluoride increased in order PO(4)(3-) < Cl(-) approximately SO(4)(2-) < Br(-) < NO(3)(-). It was found that maximum removal of fluoride from aqueous solutions was obtained in 6h at pH 6.0 with an initial concentration of 50 mg/L, and that the retention of fluoride ions by the CLDH material was 98% or higher. The residual fluoride concentration was found to be 0.4 mg/L with an initial concentration of 20 mg/L, which meets the national standard for drinking water quality. The Freundlich isotherm and Langmuir isotherm were used to fit the data of equilibrium experiments. The results of X-ray diffraction, FT-IR and TG-MS demonstrate that the adsorption phenomenon is accompanied by rehydration with concomitant uptake of fluoride ions to rebuild the initial layered structure.",

Photoelectrochemical experiments show that these hemicyanine dyes with D-\u03c0-A systems can yield efficient charge separation under illumination of simulated solar light. Alkyl chain has a remarkable effect on dye adsorbance, incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency, and overall energy conversion yield. The overall yield is approximately doubled when the methyl group replaces the long alkyl chain. Action spectrum of QS displayed a broad feature with 33.8% of maximum monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE), and a thin-layer sandwich-type solar cell based on nanocrystalline TiO2 film modified with QS produced about 2% of overall yield. For the first time, a photovoltaic liquid-junction solar cell based on nanostructured TiO2 electrode sensitized by hemicyanine dyes is reported. \u00a9 2000 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "A structured catalyst has been fabricated by immobilizing cobalt phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate (CoPcS) on a mixed metal oxide (denoted as MMO) film, which exhibits excellent activity, stability and recyclability for mercaptan sweetening. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the structured catalyst is composed of MMO nanoflakes whose ab-plane is perpendicular to the Al substrate, with desired mechanical strength and high adhesion to the substrate. In addition, in situ IR spectra and carbon dioxide temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) reveal that the moderate basic site is overwhelming in the CoPcS/MMO structured catalyst, while the strong basic site predominates in the corresponding CoPcS/MMO powder catalyst. It was found that the structured catalyst exhibits high conversion (85.7%) for the oxidation of mercaptan to disulphide, markedly higher than that of the corresponding powder catalyst (38.7%), as a result of the high exposure of active species as well as the synergistic effect between the oxidation center (CoPcS) and the moderate basic site. In addition, the structured catalyst shows superior catalysis-regeneration performance, which facilitates its repeatable and cyclic usage over a long period. Therefore, this work provides a facile and effective method for the fabrication of structured catalyst with high catalytic activity and stability, as well as recyclability, which can be used as an eco-friendly catalyst for the sweetening process in the petroleum refining industry. \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.",

The as-prepared LDH/Al-foam displays flowerlike LDH microspheres composed of numerous LDH nanoplatelets, which was confirmed by XRD and SEM. The sorption kinetics of hierarchical LDH framework for Cr(VI) was appropriately described by a pseudo-second-order model. Sorption isotherms of both Cr(VI) and RBBR were also studied, which can be fitted by the Langmuir model more satisfactorily than the Freundlich one. It was found that the sorption capacities (q MAX) of the LDH framework reached 27.8 mg g -1 for Cr(VI) and 212.8 mg g -1 for RBBR, respectively, much larger than those of the corresponding LDH powder sample (21 mg g -1 for Cr(VI) and 166.7 mg g -1 for RBBR). Furthermore, the hierarchical LDH framework exhibits excellent sorption-regeneration performances compared with the powder sample, which facilitates its repeatable and cyclic usage over a long period. Owing to the high sorption capacity, low-cost preparation, convenient manipulation, and easy regeneration of the hierarchical LDH framework, it can be potentially used as a structured adsorbent in the field of water treatment. \u00a9 2011 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Oriented Cu-Cr layered double hydroxide (LDH) films have been fabricated by the electrophoretic deposition method (EPD) on copper substrates, which can be used as photocatalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants under visible-light irradiation. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) reveal that the resulting CuCr-LDH film possesses high crystallinity, porous structure as well as large specific surface area. UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS) confirms that the CuCr-LDH film shows a broad absorption in visible light region (>400. nm). The LDH film thickness can be controlled precisely by adjusting voltage or time of EPD. The film with thickness of 16.5 \u03bcm shows excellent photocatalytic activity for the degradation of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP), sulforhodamine B (SRB) and Congo red. The photocatalytic reaction kinetics of 2,4,6-TCP was appropriately described by the pseudo-first-order model. In addition, the LDH film exhibits excellent recycleability compared with the corresponding powder sample, which facilitates its repeatable and cyclic usage over a long period. Owing to the high efficiency, low-cost preparation, easy manipulation and recyclability, it is expected that this film can be potentially used as photocatalyst in the field of water treatment. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and Uv-vis absorption spectroscopy indicate a successful intercalation of prednisone-containing micelles into galleries of the LDH matrix. The in vitro drug release studies show that no burst release phenomenon was observed at the beginning of release tests, and the pH value imposes very little influence on the release performance of prednisone in the studied pH range 4.8-7.6. It is, therefore, concluded that the MgAl-LDH can be used as an excellent inorganic drug carrier for prednisone in a wide range of pH values. Four kinetic models (first-order equation, Higuchi equation, Bhaskas equation, and Ritger-Peppas equation) were chosen to study the release kinetics of prednisone from the LDH carrier, and it was found that this process can be described by the Ritger-Peppas equation satisfactorily based on a directing Excel-based solver (DEBS). Moreover, the mechanism for drug release was also discussed. \u00a92009 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports the preparation of cobalt phthalocyanine/layered double hydroxide ultrathin films (UTFs) through an electrostatic layer-by-layer (LBL) technique as well as its application in electrocatalysis for dopamine oxidation. UV-vis absorption and electrochemical impedance spectra indicate the uniform deposition of the LBL films. XRD measurements demonstrate the long-range ordered structure of organic/inorganic UTFs, with an average repeating distance of 1.89 nm. SEM images show that the film surface displays a continuous and uniform morphology, with the root-mean-square (rms) roughness of \u223c6.4 nm revealed by AFM. The UTF modified ITO electrode exhibits significant electrocatalytic performance for the oxidation of dopamine which is related to the Co(ii)/Co(iii) couple in the (LDH/CoPcTs) n UTF. The dopamine biosensor shows rather high sensitivity, low detection limit and excellent anti-interference properties in the presence of ascorbic acid. Furthermore, compared with pristine organic multilayer (PDDA/CoPcTs) n modified electrodes, the (LDH/CoPcTs) n electrodes show superior repeatability and long-term stability, due to the immobilization and dispersion of electroactive CoPcTs molecules by LDH nanosheets. Therefore, this work demonstrates a successful paradigm for the fabrication of electroactive species in an inorganic 2D matrix, which can be potentially used for practical applications in bioanalysis and biodetection. \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

A uniform Al(2)O(3) coating was deposited on the surface of the biotemplate with an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process, and the film of ZnAl-layered double hydroxide (ZnAl-LDH), which faithfully inherits the surface structure of the biotemplate, was prepared by an in situ growth technique. Subsequently, a polycrystal ZnAl-MMO framework obtained by calcination of the LDH precursor has been demonstrated as an effective and recyclable photocatalyst for the decomposition of dyes in water, owing to its rather high specific surface area and hierarchical distribution of pore size. Therefore, the new strategy reported in this work can be used to fabricate a variety of biomorphic LDHs as well as MMO frameworks through replication of complicated and hierarchical biological structures for the purpose of catalysis, adsorbents, and other potential applications.",

        "abstract": "Multicolor luminescent films have great potential for use in optoelectronics, solid-state light-emitting materials, and optical devices. This work describes a systematic investigation of the ordered assembly of two- (blue/green, blue/orange, red/blue, red/green) and three-color (blue/red/green) light-emitting ultrathin films (UTFs) by using different photofunctional anions [bis(N-methylacridinium)@polyvinylsulfonate ion pairs and anionic derivatives of poly(p-phenylene), poly(phenylenevinylene), and poly(thiophene)] and Mg-Al-layered double hydroxide nanosheets as building blocks. The rational combination of luminescent components affords precise control of the emission wavelengths and intensity, and multicolored luminescent UTFs can be precisely tailored covering most of the visible spectral region. The assembly process of the UTFs and their luminescence properties, as monitored by UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, resulted in a gradual change in luminescence color in the selected light-emitting spectral region upon increasing the number of deposition cycles. X-ray diffraction demonstrates that the UTFs are periodic layered structures involving heterogeneous superlattices associated with individual photoactive anion-LDH units. These UTFs also exhibit well-defined multicolor polarized fluorescence with high polarization anisotropy, and the emissive color changes with polarization direction. Therefore, this work provides a way of fabricating heterogeneous UTFs with tunable-color luminescence as well as polarized multicolor emission, which have potential applications in the areas of light displays and optoelectronic devices. Heterogeneous two- (blue/green, blue/orange, red/blue, red/green) and three-color (blue/red/green) light-emitting ultrathin films have been fabricated using different photofunctional molecules and Mg-Al-layered double hydroxide nanosheets as building blocks.

        "abstract": "A novel inorganic-organic composite ultrathin film was fabricated by layer-by-layer assembly of naphthol green B (NGB) and layered double hydroxides (LDHs) nanoplatelets, which shows remarkable electrocatalytic behavior for oxidation of ascorbic acid. LDHs nanoplatelets were prepared using a method involving separate nucleation and aging steps (particle size: 25\u00b15 nm; aspect ratio: 2-4) and used as building blocks for alternate deposition with NGB on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and XRD display regular and uniform growth of the NGB/LDHs ultrathin film with extremely c-orientation of LDHs nanoplatelets (ab plane of microcrystals parallel to substrates). A continuous and uniform surface morphology was observed by SEM and AFM image. The film modified electrode displays a couple of well-defined reversible redox peaks attributed to Fe(2+)/Fe(3+) in NGB (\u0394E(p)=68 mV and I(a)/I(c)=1.1). Moreover, the modified electrode shows a high electrocatalytic activity towards ascorbic acid in the range 1.2-55.2 \u03bcM with a detection limit of 0.51 \u03bcM (S/N=3). The Michaelis-Menten constant was calculated to be K(M)(app)=67.5 \u03bcM.",

        "abstract": "The sulfonated phenylenevinylene polyanion derivate (APPV) and exfoliated Mg-Al-layered double hydroxide (LDH) monolayers were alternatively assembled into ordered ultrathin films (UTFs) employing a layer-by-layer method, which shows uniform yellow luminescence. UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy present a stepwise and regular growth of the UTFs upon increasing deposited cycles. X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy demonstrate that the UTFs are orderly periodical layered structure with a thickness of 3.3-3.5 nm per bilayer. The APPV/LDH UTFs exhibit well-defined polarized photoemission characteristic with the maximum luminescence anisotropy of approximately 0.3. Moreover, the UTF exhibit longer fluorescence lifetime (3-3.85-fold) and higher photostability than the drop-casting APPV film under UV irradiation, suggesting that the existence of a LDH monolayer enhances the optical performance of the APPV polyanion. A combination study of electrochemistry and periodic density functional theory was used to investigate the electronic structure of the APPV/LDH system, illustrating that the APPV/LDH UTF is a kind of organic-inorganic hybrid multiple quantum well (MQW) structure with a low band energy of 1.7-1.8 eV, where the valence electrons of APPV can be confined into the energy wells formed by the LDH monolayers effectively. Therefore, this work not only gives a feasible method for fabricating a luminescence ultrathin film but also provides a detailed understanding of the geometric and electronic structures of photoactive polyanions confined between the LDH monolayers.",

        "abstract": "Quantum dots (QDs) luminescent films have broad applications in optoelectronics, solid-state light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and optical devices. This work reports the fabrication of multicolor-light-emitting ultrathin films (UTFs) with 2D architecture based on CdTe QDs and MgAl layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets via the layer-by-layer deposition technique. The hybrid UTFs possess periodic layered structure, which is verified by X-ray diffraction. Tunable light emission in the red-green region is obtained by changing the particle size of QDs (CdTe-535 QDs and CdTe-635 QDs with green and red emision respectively), assembly cycle number, and sequence. Moreover, energy transfer between CdTe-535 QDs and CdTe-635 QDs occurs based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), which greatly enhances the fluorescence efficiency of CdTe-635 QDs. In addition, a theoretical study based on the F\u00f6rster theory and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrates that CdTe QDs/LDH UTFs exhibit superior capability of energy transfer owing to the ordered dispersion of QDs in the 2D LDH matrix, which agrees well with the experimental results. Therefore, this provides a facile approach for the design and fabrication of inorganic-inorganic luminescent UTFs with largely enhanced luminescence efficiency as well as stability, which can be potentially applied in multicolor optical and optoelectronic devices. \u00a9 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Moreover, the UTFs show a fast, selective and reversible luminescence response to different nitroaromatic explosives with the most significant luminescent red-shift occurring for picric acid; in addition, by combining suitable luminescent building blocks, the films can also be extended to other dual-color luminescence systems, which exhibit changes in both luminescence intensity and ratiometric fluorescence upon interaction with explosives, enlightening that these films can serve as new types of selective solid luminescent sensors towards nitroaromatic compounds. \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports the fabrication of a bi-protein/layered double hydroxide (LDH) ultrathin film in which hemoglobin (HB) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) molecules were assembled alternately with LDH nanosheets via the layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition technique, and its electrocatalytic performances for oxidation of catechol were demonstrated. The results of XRD indicate that the HB-HRP/LDH ultrathin film possesses a long range stacking order in the normal direction of the substrate, with the two proteins accommodated in the LDH gallery respectively as monolayer arrangement. SEM images show that the film surface exhibits a continuous and uniform morphology, and AFM reveals the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) roughness of \u223c10.2 nm for the film. A stable direct electrochemical redox behavior of the proteins was successfully obtained for the HB-HRP/LDH film modified electrode. In addition, it exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity towards oxidation of catechol, based on the synergistic effect of the two proteins. The catechol biosensor in this work displays a wide linear response range (6-170 \u03bcM, r=0.999), low detection limit (5 \u03bcM), high sensitivity and good reproducibility.",

        "abstract": "Two-photon solid-state fluorescence materials have received much attraction due to their wide optoelectronic applications. Herein, organic-inorganic hybrid two-photon fluorescence materials have been prepared by the introduction of a sulfonated stilbene (BSB, 4,4'-bis(2-sulfonatostyryl) biphenyl) assembled into layered double hydroxide (LDH) matrix. The structure and chemical composition of the composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA). Fluorescence spectra demonstrate that the fluorescent properties (such as emission wavelength and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY)) of the as-obtained samples can be tuned by changing the layered charge density and chemical composition, in which the BSB/Zn3Al-LDH sample exhibited the highest emission intensity and PLQY. Moreover, the BSB/Zn3Al-LDH film was further fabricated by a solvent evaporation method, and the film exhibited well-defined one-photon and two-photon excited polarized photoemission with the anisotropy of ca. 0.12. It can be expected that these BSB/LDH systems can serve as a good candidate for new type of solid-state up-conversion and polarized fluorescent materials. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Hydrophobic anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has been included in the carboxymethyl modified \u03b2-cyclodextrin (CMCD), and the inclusion complex (5-FU/CMCD) was further intercalated into galleries of a zinc aluminum layered double hydroxide (ZnAl-LDH) by the ion-exchange method. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and UV-vis spectroscopy indicate a successful intercalation of 5-FU/CMCD into the LDH gallery. The release behavior of 5-FU from drug/CMCD-LDH composite at different pH values was studied. It was found that 5-FU was released faster in pH 7.2 than in the acidic mediums (pH 4.8), and the released amount was higher. The introduction of CMCD into the LDH matrix could prolong the drug release time in comparison to that from LDH without CMCD, which can be attributed to the inclusion of 5-FU by the CMCD cavity. Studies on mathematical modeling of drug release show that the release of 5-FU from the drug/CMCD-LDH composite follows the Korsmeyer-Peppas equation very well at different pH values. The drug/CMCD inclusion complex intercalated LDH composite in this work provides a supramolecular formulation for controlled release behavior, which can be potentially applied for nonionic and hydrophobic drugs. \u00a9 2010 American Chemical Society.",

The structure and composition of the intercalated material have been studied by X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. A schematic model of the intercalated structure has been proposed. Furthermore, the thermal decomposition of the hybrid material has been characterized by in situ powder X-ray diffraction, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, differential thermal analysis, 13C solid-state magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, temperature-programmed decomposition, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The thermolysis of L-Asp LDH is quite different from that of the pristine L-Asp studied as a reference sample and is characterized by three steps: the first from room temperature to 150 \u00b0C is attributed to the loss of both adsorbed and interlayer water, accompanied by the destruction of the hydrogen bonding network and a decrease in basal spacing; the second step (250\u223c350 \u00b0C) involves the polymerization and deamination of L-Asp ions in the interlayer of LDH and dehydroxylation of the brucite-like layers; the third step in the temperature region of 350\u223c450 \u00b0C corresponds to dehydroxylation of the brucite-like layers as well as further decomposition of interlayer materials.",

UV-vis absorption spectroscopy indicates a stepwise and regular growth of the PTS/LDH UTFs upon increasing deposition cycles. X-Ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy demonstrate that the UTFs possess a periodical layered structure perpendicular to the substrates with a thickness of 1.93-1.98 nm per bilayer. Furthermore, the fluorescence chemosensor with film thickness of 48 nm (24 bilayers) exhibits a broad linear response range for Cu2+ solution (0.6-50 \u03bcM), good repeatability (RSD less than 5% in 20 consecutive measurements), high photostability and storage stability (\u223c93.2% of its initial fluorescence intensity remains after one month) as well as excellent selectivity. In addition, the study on mechanism of measurement-regeneration cycle of the fluorescence chemosensor shows that Cu2+ enters/departs from the PTS/LDH UTF with reversible change in chemical composition, surface morphology and fluorescence anisotropy. Therefore, this work provides new opportunities for fabrication and application of chromophore/LDH UTFs which can be used as fluorescence chemosensors. \u00a9 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

The Beryllon II/LDH UTFs display ratiometric fluorescence response for Be 2+ with a linear response range in 1.0\u00d710 -7-1.9\u00d710 -6molL -1 and a detection limit of 4.2\u00d710 -9molL -1. Furthermore, the ratiometric sensor exhibits good repeatability, high stability (thermal, storage and mechanical) as well as excellent selectivity toward Be 2+. XPS and Raman measurements demonstrate that the specific response of the sensor is attributed to the coordination between Be 2+ and Beryllon II in the UTF. The Beryllon II/LDH UTFs in this work can be potentially used as a chemosensor for the detection of Be 2+ in the environmental and biomedical field. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

ANS and a series of surfactants with different alkyl chain lengths (pentanesulphonate (PES), hexanesulphonate (HES), heptanesulphonate (HPS), decanesulphonate (DES), and dodecylsulphonate (DDS)) were respectively cointercalated into the galleries of ZnAl-LDH by the anion exchange method.

It was found that the ANS/HPS-LDH film showed the maximum fluorescence efficiency and the longest intensity-average lifetime among these ANS/surfactant-LDH composites owing to the \"size-matching\" rule between the organic dye and surfactant. Moreover, the fluorescence properties can be tuned by changing the relative molar ratio of ANS/HPS, and the film containing 20% ANS (molar percentage, expressed as ANS(20%)/HPS-LDH) exhibits the maximum fluorescence efficiency, the longest average lifetime, and significantly enhanced photo and thermal stability. In addition, the composite films show fluorescence anisotropy, attributed to the preferential orientation of ANS in the LDH gallery. Therefore, this work demonstrates a feasible approach to tuning the photoluminescence properties of a dye confined in an inorganic 2D matrix via changing the interlayer microenvironment, which may be considered to be a good candidate for solid photoluminescence materials, nonlinear optics, and polarized luminescence materials.",

        "abstract": "Multifunctional mixed metal oxide (MMO) thin films on quartz substrates have been fabricated by layer-by-layer assembly of layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles and poly(sodium styrene 4-sulfonate) (PSS) followed by calcination, which exhibited properties of both antireflection (AR) and antifogging (AF). The AR and AF performances are related to the low refractive index and superhydrophilicity originating from the nanoporous structure. The influences of deposition cycle, LDH particle size and calcination temperature on AR and AF behavior were thoroughly studied. A maximum transmittance of 98.7% at 650 nm and a minimum time of 0.2 s for a droplet to spread flat (water contact angle \u223c0\u00b0) were achieved with LDH particle size of 110 nm, 10 cycles of deposition and calcination temperature of 450 \u00b0C. Therefore, this work provides a facile approach for the fabrication of multifunctional coatings, which can be potentially used in photovoltaic devices, optical lens and underwater imaging systems. Keywords Layered double hydroxides Antireflection Antifogging Layer-by-layer Coatings 1 Introduction Antireflective (AR) coatings have recently attracted much interest for their applications in photovoltaic, displaying devices and all kinds of optical lenses [1\u20133] , owing to their ability to enhance the transmittance of light and remove ghost images. The principle of AR coatings is based on the destructive interference of reflected light from air-film and film-substrate interfaces. An ideal homogeneous single-layer AR coating satisfies the following conditions [4] : (1) the thickness of the coating is \u03bb /4, where \u03bb is the wavelength of the incident light; (2) n c = ( n a n s ) 1/2 , where n c , n a and n s are the refractive indices of the coating, air and substrate, respectively. For a glass substrate ( n s = \u223c1.5), the refractive index of AR material should be \u223c1.22. However, nature materials with such low refractive index are either rare or expensive to obtain in thin film form. As a substitute, nanoporous materials are usually chosen as AR coatings, since the introduction of the nanopores can reduce the refractive index of the coatings and satisfy the AR requirement [5\u20137] . The refractive index of porous coatings can be well tailored by controlling the percentage of pores introduced, in which larger percentage of pores leads to lower refractive index. Up to now, many methods have been developed to obtain nanoporous film materials for use as AR coatings, including sol\u2013gel process [8] , phase-separation [9] , sacrificial porogen approach [10\u201312] , layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition of nanoparticle multilayers [13,14] , plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition [15] and deposition of nanorods or nanowires [16,17] . Compared with other methods, the LBL assembly technique holds a great potential in the fabrication of AR coatings because of its simplicity in preparation of films with large area and its facility in depositing films on non-flat surfaces [18,19] . Although the materials and methods for the preparation of porous AR coatings are diverse, there are still several serious issues should be concerned for the application of the resultant AR coatings, especially the influence of water vapor existing in the external environment. Water vapor molecules condense and form water droplets on the surface, resulting in scattering and reflection of light, which in turn decreases the transmittance of the AR coating. A superhydrophilic coating, on which the water contact angle is less than 5\u00b0 within 0.5 s as soon as a water droplet contacts such surface, can solve this problem [20\u201322] . Superhydrophilic coatings can significantly suppress the fogging behavior by the rapid spread and flow of water droplets on their surface and therefore eliminate the light scattering caused by water droplets. In fact, AR coatings combined with an antifogging (AF) capability are highly desired in daily used eyeglasses, swimming goggles, periscopes, lenses in endoscopic surgery, and so forth. Layered double hydroxides (LDH) are layered anionic clays generally expressed by the formula [ M 1 \u2212 x 2 + M x 3 + ( OH ) 2 ] ( A n \u2212 ) \u22c5 m H 2 O , where M 2+ and M 3+ are di- and trivalent metal cations and A n \u2212 is a counter anion [23\u201326] . The host structure consists of brucite-like layers of edge-sharing M(OH) 6 octahedra, and the partial substitution of M 3+ for M 2+ results in positively-charged host layers, balanced by the interlayer anions [27\u201330] . It is well-known that calcination of LDH at intermediate temperatures in the range 300\u2013600 \u00b0C leads to the formation of mixed metal oxides (MMO) which possess porous structures and large specific surface areas as well as good thermal stability [31\u201333] . In our previous work [34] , a nanoporous MMO coating was fabricated by calcination of (LDH/PSS) n (\u2018 n \u2019 denotes the number of deposition cycles) multilayer films on quartz glass substrate, which exhibited erasable AR properties with excellent mechanical stability and good adhesion to substrates. However, detailed AR properties of the MMO coating dependent on the fabrication parameters (e.g. particle size, number of deposition cycle, calcination temperature) as well as its applicability in practical environment remain unresolved. In this work, nanoporous MMO films were fabricated via LBL assembly of (LDH/PSS) n films followed by calcination. The presence of nanopores in MMO coatings leads to multi-functionalities including both AR and AF properties, which are dependent on the number of deposition cycle, size of LDH nanoparticles and calcination temperature. The transmittance of the substrate increases to a maximum and then decreases along with the increase of coating thickness, owing to the diffuse scattering induced by the increased surface roughness. Larger nanoparticles of LDH precursor are more effective in enhancing transmittance and hydrophilicity than smaller nanoparticles. Systematic investigation gave an optimal condition for the fabrication of MMO film with excellent AR and AF behavior: a maximum transmittance of 98.7% at 650 nm and a minimum spread time of 0.2 s for a droplet (water contact angle \u223c0\u00b0) were achieved by calcination of the (LDH/PSS) 10 film with LDH particle size of 110 nm at 450 \u00b0C. Therefore, the present study provide a feasible strategy for the design and fabrication of antireflective and antifogging coatings, which can be used in optical devices and antifogging manipulation. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of colloidal LDH suspension Colloidal LDH suspension was prepared according to the reported procedure [35] . Typically, 100 ml of solution A (Mg(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O: 0.2 M and Al(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O: 0.1 M) and 400 ml of solution B (NaOH: 0.15 M) were simultaneously added to a colloid mill with rotor speed of 3000 rpm and mixed for 1 min. The resulting LDH slurry was obtained via centrifugation and washed twice with deionized water and then dispersed in 400 mL of deionized water. This aqueous suspension was transferred into a stainless steel autoclave with a Teflon lining. After hydrothermal treatment at 110 \u00b0C for a period of time (4\u201348 h), stable homogeneous LDH suspension with various particle size was obtained. 2.2 Construction of antireflection and antifogging coatings Multilayer films of LDH nanoparticles/PSS were fabricated by electrostatic layer-by-layer (LBL) method. Quartz glass slide or silicon wafer were pretreated in a bath of methanol/HCl (1/1, v/v) and then concentrated H 2 SO 4 for 30 min each to make the substrates surface hydrophilic and negatively charged. The overall LBL process consists of a cyclic repetition of the following steps: (a) dipping the pretreated substrates into the colloidal LDH suspension containing MgAl-LDH nanoparticles for 10 min, followed by rinsing with deionized water thoroughly; (b) dipping into an aqueous solution of PSS (1.0 g/L) for 10 min and washed with deionized water. Subsequently, a series of these operations for LDH nanoparticles and PSS were repeated n times to obtain multilayer films of (LDH/PSS) n . The resulting films were finally rinsed with deionized water and dried at ambient temperature. The substrates coated with (LDH/PSS) n film were annealed at appropriate temperature for 3 h to remove the porogen species and produce a mixed metal oxide (MMO) film with nanoporous structure. The typical procedures for the fabrication of AR and AF multifunctional coatings are shown in Scheme 1 . 2.3 Sample characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were collected using a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer under the following conditions: 40 kV, 30 mA, graphite filtered Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 0.1542 nm). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on a Zeiss Supra 55 field emission scanning electron microscope. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were collected using a NanoScope IIIa AFM from Veeco Instruments in the tapping-mode in air. UV\u2013vis absorption and transmittances spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-2501PC spectrometer. Static water contact angles were measured using a sessile drop at three different points of each film sample using a commercial drop shape analysis system (DSA100, KR\u00fcSS GmbH, Germany) at ambient temperature. The volume of water droplets used for measurement is 2 \u03bcL. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Preparation of LDH colloidal suspension and assembly of multilayer coatings The X-ray diffraction patterns of MgAl-LDH materials exhibit the typical layered features with a high crystallinity, as shown in Fig. 1 . In each case, the XRD pattern displays the characteristic reflections of the LDH structure with a series of (0 0 l ) peaks appearing as narrow, symmetric, strong lines at low angle. The basal spacing of all the LDH samples is \u223c0.873 nm and the lattice parameter a is 0.305 nm, close to the reported value for nitrate-containing LDH phase [36\u201339] . The well-dispersed LDH suspension was transparent and stable without any precipitation when stored in an N 2 atmosphere for more than one month. The morphology of LDH nanoparticles was examined by SEM ( Fig. 2 ), which reveals that the individual MgAl\u2013NO 3 LDH nanoparticles with narrow size distribution were obtained after hydrothermal treatment. The particle size can be steadily controlled by changing the hydrothermal time. LDH colloidal suspension with average particle size of 25 nm (denoted as LDH-25), 45 nm (LDH-45), 70 nm (LDH-70) and 110 nm (LDH-110) were obtained with treatment time of 4, 8, 18 and 48 h, respectively. It was reported the colloidal LDH nanoparticle suspension in aqueous solution shows a positive zeta potential in the range 30\u201350 mV [40] , indicating that the external surface of LDH nanoparticles is positively charged. Therefore, colloidal LDH nanopaticles can be used as building blocks without any surface modification for the assembly of functional multilayer films with negatively charged electrolytes by the electrostatic LBL technique. In this work, the positively charged LDH nanoparticles were alternately deposited with negatively charged PSS to fabricate LDH/PSS multilayer films. The subsequent growth of LDH/PSS multilayer film was monitored by means of the UV-vis absorption bands of PSS (193 and 225 nm) as depicted in Fig. 3 . From the inset of Fig. 3 , a linear increase in absorbance at 193 nm upon increasing the bilayer number was observed, indicating a stepwise and regular growth of LDH nanoparticle/PSS multilayer films. The LDH/PSS multilayer films deposited on quartz substrates were calcinated in an oven at 450 \u00b0C for 3 h to remove the organic components and interlayer anions of LDH, resulting in the formation of MMO films with a nanoporous structure. Fig. 4 shows the SEM images of (MMO- m ) n coatings obtained by calcination of (LDH- m /PSS) n films ( m denotes the particle size of LDH precursor; n represents the number of deposition cycle for the (LDH/PSS) n films). Dense and uniform nanopores can be clearly observed on the surface of (MMO- m ) 10 coatings, and the pore size increased from 10 nm to 60 nm upon increasing the precursor LDH particle size. The atomic force microscope (AFM) images ( Fig. 5 ) of the (MMO-25) n films with different bilayer number ( n = 8, 16, 24, 30) further reveals the porous structure. Clearly aggregated nanoparticles create hill-to-valley surface cavities that typically extend about 20\u201360 nm in depth. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the MMO film increases from 3.42 to 19.26 nm as the bilayer number varies from 8 to 30. The morphological feature of the film would be beneficial to enhance the transmittance of the substrates as well as superhydrophilicity, which will be discussed in the next section. 3.2 Multifunctionality of MMO coatings The AR properties of the calcinated LDH/PSS films were investigated by using the transmittance measurement. Fig. 6 A shows the transmission spectra of quartz substrates coated with (MMO-25) n ( n = 8, 16, 24, 30) film. The transmission spectrum of a bare quartz substrate was also provided for comparison, which exhibits a transmittance of \u223c92.1% in the spectral range between 300 and 800 nm. The transmittance of quartz substrates coated with (MMO-25) n films was dramatically enhanced compared with the bare substrate, indicating the AR property of the resultant coatings. Along with the increase of n , the transmittance first increased from n = 8 (\u223c93.1%) to n = 24 (\u223c95.9%) at the wavelength of 650 nm; however, it decreased with further increase of deposition cycle ( n = 30: \u223c95.0%). The decrease in transmittance results from the enhanced diffuse scattering accompanying the increase of surface roughness, which has already been confirmed by AFM characterization. A similar trend was also observed for the (MMO-45) n , (MMO-70) n and (MMO-110) n coatings; i.e., the transmittance reached a maximum value with a specific thickness and then decreased for thicker samples. The maximum transmittance values were found to be 95.9%, 96.7%, 97.7% and 98.7% for the films of (MMO-25) 24 , (MMO-45) 21 , (MMO-70) 14 and (MMO-110) 10 , respectively ( Fig. 6 A\u2013D). Therefore, the transmission of MMO films can be well tuned by changing the particle size of LDH precursor as well as the deposition cycle. The optimal AR property of the (MMO-110) 10 film was also exhibited straightforwardly in Fig. 6 E. The clear words below the AR coating demonstrate the increased transparency and reduced reflection, whereas the bare substrate reflects the sunlight significantly, and the words below are not as clear as those of the AR coating. Taking into account the potential application of these AR coatings in humid environment, the water wetting behavior of the MMO films was studied by water contact angle measurements with a water droplet of 2 \u03bcL as the indicator. As shown in Fig. 7 A and B , as the water droplet contacted the surface coated with (MMO-110) 10 film, it spread over the surface completely within 0.2 s, demonstrating a superhydrophilic surface. The hydrophilic MMO material accompanied with the three dimensional porous structure further increased the hydrophilicity of the film because of the nanowicking of water into the network of capillaries present in the coating. The time-dependent changes in water-droplet contact angle of the coating with various precursor LDH particle size are shown in Fig. 7 C, demonstrating excellent superhydrophilicity for all the samples. The time for water droplet spread flat ranges in 0.4\u20130.2 s as the LDH particle size varies from \u223c25 to \u223c110 nm. Superhydrophilic coatings can significantly suppress the fogging behavior, since condensed water droplets will spread flat almost instantaneously to form a thin sheet-like water membrane [20\u201322] . In this way, light scattering by the condensed water droplets is eliminated. The thin water membrane eventually disappears either by sliding down under the influence of gravity or by evaporation. The photograph in Fig. 7 D illustrates the antifogging behavior of the superhydrophilic MMO coatings. A quartz substrate coated with the (MMO-110) 10 film on both sides and a bare quartz slide were cooled to about \u221212 \u00b0C in a refrigerator, and then were exposed to the humid air simultaneously (relative humidity \u224845%). As shown in the upper part of Fig. 7 D, the bare quartz slide fogged immediately. The words below the slide were blurred by the strong light scattering resulting from the surface dewdrops. In sharp contrast, the quartz slide coated with the superhydrophilic MMO film remained highly transparent and the words below were clearly seen (bottom part of Fig. 7 D). 3.3 Effects of calcination temperature on the AR and wetting behavior The AR and AF properties of (MMO) n coatings originate from their nanoporous structure. Different calcination temperature induces diverse proportion of void fraction in the coating, which affects the final AR and AF behavior. The (LDH-110/PSS) 10 coating was treated at 200, 350, 450 and 500 \u00b0C for 3 h respectively, in order to study the influence of calcination temperature on the transmittance/wettability of the film. As shown in Fig. 8 , transmittance of the film increases gradually from 87.4% to 98.7% at 650 nm as the calcination temperature increases from 200 to 450 \u00b0C. Furthermore, effects of calcination temperature on the hydrophilicity of resultant coatings were also investigated. The water contact angle of the LDH/PSS film (\u223c57\u00b0, Fig. 9 A ) is much larger than that of the MMO coatings after calcination. It decreased from \u223c15\u00b0 to \u223c0\u00b0 as the calcination temperature increased from 200 to 450 \u00b0C. Further increase of the calcination temperature to 500 \u00b0C showed insignificant influence on the AR and hydrophilicity, indicating the achievement of decomposition equilibrium for the porogen (organic component and interlayer species of LDH) and the formation of stable nanopores at 450 \u00b0C. 3.4 Long-term stability of the AR and AF coatings In this work, the long-term stability of both AR and AF properties for the MMO films was investigated, which is extremely important for practical applications. The superhydrophilicity of the coating was maintained after 100 days storage ( Fig. 10 A ). The spread time for the water droplet on the porous MMO coating increased slightly (from 0.2 s to 0.32 s), indicative of the stability for the AF property. Compared with TiO 2 -based coatings [41\u201343] which lose their superhydrophilic properties with the absence of UV irradiation, MMO coatings in this work retained their superhydrophilicity even in the dark owing to the different mechanism of superhydrophilicity. As described above, the presence of nanopores in the MMO film structure leads to nanowicking of water into the network of capillaries in the coatings; therefore, the AF properties are retained without UV irradiation. Furthermore, the AR properties did not show any decrease after storage of the porous MMO films under ambient conditions for 100 days ( Fig. 10 B), demonstrating the excellent stability of the AR coatings. The highly durable stability of the porous MMO coatings was further confirmed by XRD ( Fig. 10 C) characterization. The presence of 2 0 0 and 2 2 0 reflections attributed to a MgO phase demonstrated that the reconstruction of LDH structure did not occur after 100 days at ambient temperature. The long-term stability of MMO films guarantees the application of the AR and AF coatings under practical conditions. 4 Conclusions This work provides a facile and cost-effective method for the fabrication of AR and AF coatings by LBL deposition of LDH nanoparticles with PSS on quartz substrates followed by calcination. The resulting MMO films possess nanopores resulting from the removal of organic components and interlayer species of LDH nanoparticles, and thus exhibit increased transmittance and superhydrophilicity simultaneously. The influences of the size of LDH nanoparticles, the number of assembly cycle and the calcination temperature on the AR and AF properties have been studied thoroughly. A maximum transmittance of 98.7% at 650 nm and a minimum time of 0.2 s for a droplet to spread flat were achieved by calcining the (LDH-110/PSS) 10 film at 450 \u00b0C. Additionally, the present method for the fabrication of AR and AF coatings has the advantages of simplicity, easy manipulation, low-cost and large area production.

        "abstract": "This paper describes a combined experimental and theoretical simulation investigation on the photophysical properties, thermolysis, and orientation of 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylate (PTCB) intercalated Mg-Al-layered double hydroxide (PTCB/Mg-Al-LDH). UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy show the existence of PTCB aggregates within the gallery of LDH, indicative of H-type (blue-shifted absorption band) and J-type dimers (red-shifted absorption band). In situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD), thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) and elemental analysis were used to study the thermal decomposition properties of PTCB/Mg-Al-LDH, and it was found that the decomposition temperature of the intercalated PTCB is lower than its pristine form (460 vs 565 degrees C), indicating that the strong pi-pi interaction among PTCB was weakened by the positively charged LDH host layers. Molecular dynamics (MD) calculations were employed to simulate the molecular arrangement and aggregation behavior of intercalated PTCB in the gallery of Mg-Al-LDH. The simulation results show that the intercalated PTCB anions exhibit a tendency from tilted to vertical orientation with respect to the layers as the interlayer water content increases, furthermore, the H and J-type dimer species are most likely populated under low and high hydration conditions, respectively. Moreover, the distribution of interlayer water molecules are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "Transparent and flexible multilayer films are fabricated based on the alternating assembly of cellulose acetate (CA) and layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoplatelets followed by thermal annealing treatment. The films exhibit tremendously enhanced oxygen barrier properties. The oxygen transmission rate (OTR) of the resulting (CA/LDH)n multilayer films can be tuned by changing the aspect ratio of high-crystalline LDH nanoplatelets from 20 to 560. The (CA/LDH)20 film displays excellent oxygen-barrier behavior with an OTR equal to or below the detection limit of commercial instrumentation (<0.005 cm3 m-2 day-1), much superior to the previously reported inorganic flake-filled barrier film. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that a hydrogen bonding network occurs at the interface of highly oriented LDH nanoplatelets and CA molecules, accounting for the suppression of oxygen transportation and the resulting largely improved barrier behavior. In addition, the durability of (CA/LDH)n films against humidity, temperature, and light irradiation is successfully demonstrated, which would guarantee their practical application. Therefore, this work provides a facile and cost-effective strategy for the fabrication of an LDH-based oxygen barrier material, which could potentially be used in flexible displays and drug and food packaging. ? 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The structure and chemical composition of the composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, thermogravimetry, and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA). Fluorescence spectra demonstrate that the sample with 4.76% SRB molar percentage, with respect to the total organic material, exhibits the optimal luminous intensity. The fluorescence lifetime of SRB in SRB-DBS/LDH is enhanced significantly compared with that of pristine SRB in solution (4.14 vs 2.05 ns). SRB-DBS/LDH thin films on the quartz substrates were constructed by the solvent evaporation method. Steady-state polarization photoemission spectra show that the luminescence anisotropy of SRB-DBS/LDH thin films (r=0.10) was enhanced remarkably compared with that of a powder sample (r=0+/-0.01) at ambient temperature, whereas the anisotropy of both film and powder samples was largely improved at low temperature (77 K). Furthermore, the SRB-DBS/LDH thin films exhibit a luminescence anisotropy decay effect in the range of their fluorescence lifetime. These results demonstrate that the SRB-DBS/LDH thin films could be used as a good candidate for the immobilization of laser dyes and polarized luminescence materials.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports the fabrication of layered double hydroxide nanosheets (LDH nanosheets)/Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) ultrathin films (UTFs) via the layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly technique, and their electrocatalytic performance for the oxidation of glucose was demonstrated. UV-vis absorption spectra show the uniform growth of the UTFs and the enhancement of interlayer plasmon coupling of AuNPs upon increasing deposition cycle. The XRD results indicate that the (LDH/AuNPs)n UTFs possess long-range order stacking in the normal direction of the substrate, with AuNPs accommodated between the LDH nanosheets as a monolayer arrangement. SEM, TEM and AFM images reveal a high dispersion of AuNPs on the surface of the LDH nanosheets without aggregation. The electrochemical behavior of the UTF modified fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode was studied by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The (LDH/AuNPs)n UTF shows improved electron transfer kinetics, owing to the formation of electron tunneling junctions resulting from the interlayer plasmon coupling. This leads to new channels for facilitating electron transfer within the UTFs. In addition, the (LDH/AuNPs)8 electrode displays significant electrocatalytic performance for glucose with a linear response range (50 \u03bcM-20 mM), low detection limit (10.8 \u03bcM), high sensitivity (343 \u03bcA mM-1 cm-2), good stability and reproducibility. Therefore, this work provides a feasible method to immobilize metal nanoparticles using the LDH nanosheet as a 2D matrix, which is promising for the development of enzyme-free sensors. \u00a9 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

The monomers of AA and AMPS were cointercalated into galleries of Mg 2Al-LDH (denoted as AA-AMPS/LDH) with various molar ratios by ion-exchange method, which was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and elemental analysis. The polymer-based superabsorbent was prepared through in situ free-radical aqueous copolymerization of AA and AMPS, with AA-AMPS/LDH as additive, N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (NMBA) as crosslinker and potassium persulfate (KPS) as initiator. The composition of this poly (AA-co-AMPS)/LDH was demonstrated as a good water superabsorbent. The LDH content, water absorbency, thermal stability, and swelling rate of this superabsorbent were also investigated in detail. Results showed that the incorporation of a 5 wt % AA-AMPS/LDH into polymer matrix increased its water absorbency significantly by 27.7% (in water) and by 51.5% (in 0.9 wt % NaCl solution). \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Firstly, several chromophore/LDH solid-state powdered materials with attractive photophysical properties are introduced. Attention is then focused on ordered photoemissive LDH-based thin films, and their polarized luminescence properties and stimuli-responsive behavior as sensors.

        "abstract": "Finely dispersed Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) anchored to CoAl layered double hydroxide nanowalls (LDH-NWs) have been fabricated via a facile in situ redox reaction between the LDH-NWs and the PdCl4 2- precursor. The integrated LDH-NWs play the roles of both a hierarchical support and a reductant without any external agent, ensuring the cleanness of the metal-support interface. Based on the effective exposure of the Pd active sites and the elaborate network architecture, the Pd/LDH-NW heterogenous material yields a largely improved catalytic activity as well as robust durability towards ethanol electrooxidation in comparison with the commercial Pd/C catalyst. Moreover, a density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicates that the enhancement in the electrocatalytic properties originates from the synergistic effect between the metal and support, in which the LDH support stabilizes the PdNPs via the formation of a Pd-HO bond which is accompanied by an electron transfer from the LDH to the PdNPs. This work provides a promising approach for the design and fabrication of highly efficient metal-supported nanocatalysts which can be used in fuel cells and other related catalytic reactions. \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.",

Furthermore, the hybrid NPA electrode also exhibits excellent rate capability with a specific energy of 39.4 Wh/kg at a current density of 40 A/g, as well as good long-term cycling stability (92.5% of its original capacitance is retained after 5000 cycles). These performances are superior to those of conventional supercapacitors and LDH NPA without the PEDOT coating. The largely enhanced pseudocapacitor behavior of the LDH@PEDOT NPA electrode is related to the synergistic effect of its individual components: the LDH nanoplatelet core provides abundant energy-storage capacity, while the highly conductive PEDOT shell and porous architecture facilitate the electron/mass transport in the redox reaction.",

The 1DPCs were prepared via the alternate deposition of titania and layered double hydroxide (LDH) by the spin-coating technique followed by calcination (which induces the phase transformation of LDH to MMO material). A photonic stop band (PSB) of MMO-TiO 2 1DPCs was obtained, which can be tuned throughout the whole visible light region by changing the thickness of either of the composing slabs, as a result of the sufficiently high refractive index contrast between TiO 2 and MMO. The 1DPC film as a colorimetric sensor shows significant color variation towards VOCs or RH, due to the change of refractive index induced by the adsorption of volatile gas or water molecule in the mesopores of the MMO-TiO 2 structure. In addition, the sensor displays high sensitivity, good stability and reproducibility. Therefore, this work provides a feasible method for the fabrication of 1DPCs based on porous MMO-TiO 2 films, which have potential applications as portable, recyclable and visually readable colorimetric sensors. \u00a9 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "The fluorescent ultrathin films (UTFs) based on layered double hydroxide/8-amino-1,3,6-naphthalenetrisulfonate (LDH/ANTS) have been prepared by employing a layer-by-layer assembly technique, and its application as an optical biosensor for dextran-40 was demonstrated. UV-vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy have been adopted to monitor the assembly process. The UTFs display a continuous and uniform morphology, with a long-range ordered structure. It was found that the UTFs can be used for dextran-40 sensing in the concentration range 1.0 \u00d7 10-5 to 1.0 \u00d7 10-2 M, and the detection limit of 2.7 \u00d7 10-6 M is obtained. Good selectivity toward dextran-40 over other saccharides, including glucose, fructose and sucrose, has been demonstrated. Furthermore, the UTFs show a good reusable ability for dextran-40 by recovering the UTFs in a H2O 2 aqueous solution (1.0 \u00d7 10-4 M), with the relative standard deviation of 4.18% toward dextran-40 for 10 cycles. The fluorescence response of the film sensor is attributed to a strong interaction between ANTS and dextran-40, which was verified by XPS, Raman and polarized photoemission spectroscopy, accounting for the significant fluorescence quenching of the LDH/ANTS film. The results indicate that the LDH/ANTS UTFs in this work can be used as a biosensor for the detection of dextran-40. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we report the fabrication of layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles/poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) ultrathin films (UTFs) via the layer-by-layer assembly technique, and their switchable electrocatalytic performance in response to temperature stimuli was demonstrated. X-ray diffraction and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy indicate a periodic layered structure with uniform and regular growth of the (LDH/pNIPAM)(n) UTFs; an interaction based on hydrogen bonding between LDH nanoparticles and pNIPAM was confirmed by X-ray-photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Temperature-triggered cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy switch for the UTFs was obtained between 20 and 40 \u00b0C, accompanied by reversible changes in surface topography and film thickness revealed by atomic force microscopy and ellipsometry, respectively. The electrochemical on-off property of the temperature-controlled (LDH/pNIPAM)(n) UTFs originates from the contraction-expansion configuration of pNIPAM with low-high electrochemical impedance. In addition, a switchable electrocatalytic behavior of the (LDH/pNIPAM)(n) UTFs toward the oxidation of glucose was observed, resulting from the temperature-controlled charge transfer rate. Therefore, this work provides a facile approach for the design and fabrication of a well-ordered command interface with a temperature-sensitive property, which can be potentially applied in electrochemical sensors and switching.",

The structure and composition of the intercalated materials have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and elemental analysis. It is found that intercalation can inhibit racemization of L-tyrosine under the influence of sunlight, high temperature or ultraviolet light. Therefore, this layered material may have potential application as a \"molecular container\" for storing or transporting unstable chiral biomolecules or pharmaceutical agents. In addition, the thermal decomposition of the L-tyrosine intercalated NiAl-LDH has been investigated in detail by means of in situ HT-XRD, in situ FT-IR and TG-DTA. Loss of interlayer water occurs between room temperature and 150C while decomposition of intercalated L-tyrosine and dehydroxylation of the host layers begin at about 250C and 300C respectively.

The effects of pH value and adsorption time on the adsorption behavior were studied. The CMCD-LDH film shows a higher selectivity for G than A under identical conditions of G and A, which results from the ability of selective recognition of the interlayer CMCD. The kinetic studies show that adsorption of A and G by the CMCD-LDH film can be described satisfactorily by the slab diffusion model. Both the values of diffusion coefficient (D) and adsorption capability (qe) of G by the CMCD-LDH film are larger than those of A, demonstrating the selective adsorption of the CMCD-LDH film for nucleosides. Due to its easy preparation and manipulation, this film is expected to be successfully applied in the field of selective adsorption and separation. \u00a92010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It was shown that the higher the calcination temperature, the more complete the crystal structure, and the larger the particle size. Moreover, the influence of calcination time on the crystal structure was insignificant when it was more than 3h at 700\u00b0C. With the increase of x in Li xMn2O4 in the range of 0.6-1.0, the d 111 and lattice parameter a increased first and then decreased. The electrochemical properties of nano-spinel LiMn2O4 using as cathode material of lithium-ion battery were studied. The low discharge capacity might be due to the irreversible capacity loss brought by the large surface area and lattice vacancies of the nano-spinel.",

Herein, Ni nanoparticles (NPs) immobilized on a TiO2 support were synthesized via a deposition-precipitation method followed by a calcination-reduction process (denoted as Ni/TiO2-DP), which can be used as a promising heterogeneous catalyst towards CO2 methanation. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images show that Ni NPs are highly dispersed on the TiO 2 surface (particle size: 2.2 nm), with a low Ni-Ni coordination number revealed by the hydrogen temperature programmed desorption (H 2-TPD) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) techniques. Moreover, the catalyst with a Ni loading of 15 wt% exhibits excellent catalytic behavior towards CO2 methanation (conversion: 96%; selectivity: 99%) at a reaction temperature as low as 260 \u00b0C. The good dispersion of Ni NPs with large unsaturation facilitates a high exposure of active sites, which accelerates the formation of surface-dissociated hydrogen and the subsequent hydrogenation removal of surface nickel carbonyl species, accounting for the resulting enhanced low-temperature catalytic performance. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

The following calcination at higher temperatures give ZnAl 2O 4 crystallines with a lathlike mesoporous framework.

        "abstract": "Periodic solid models have been employed to investigate the structural and energetic properties of cation-disordered Mg-Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs), including composition, ordering, and stacking pattern of layers. The geometry, lattice energy and density of states (DOS) of the periodic models were computed using the plane-wave pseudopotential implementation of density functional theory (DFT) with the virtual crystal approximation (VCA). The calculation results for the MgAl-Cl-LDH model show that a pure LDH phase is difficult to sustain when the Mg/Al ratio (R) is R > or = 4. The stability of the cation-disordered MgAl-Cl-LDH unit cell increases upon increasing R, owing to the decrease in the number of Al(III)-O-Al(III) linkages in the LDH sheets. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of MgAl-Cl-LDH receive contributions from the 3s and 3p orbitals of Mg and Al and the 2p orbitals of O and Cl, respectively, implying significant host-guest interactions. The increase of R leads to the decrease in electron density of 3s and 3p of metal cation and that of 2p in Cl. Consequently, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap as well as the systematical stability increase upon increasing R. From this point of view, it has been demonstrated that the cations distribute in an ordered arrangement with the absence of Al(III)-O-Al(III) linkages if R is in the low range (R = 2-3). It was also found that the 3R polytype is the most stable stacking pattern with the same Mg/Al ratio, owing to the fact that the conductive band energy levels decline with the increase of electron density of 3s and 3p of the metal cation in the 3R-stacking system. These findings agree well with the experimental results and provide a profound understanding of critical factors influencing the structure of LDHs, including metal composition and ordering, the stacking sequence, as well as the host-guest interactions.",

        "abstract": "Direct synthesis of ethanol from syngas derived from coal, natural gas, or biomass is one of the most promising routes for renewable energy production. In this work, Ce-promoted highly-dispersed Rh catalyst on TiO2 support was prepared by the deposition-precipitation method, which exhibits largely enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity for ethanol production from syngas. XRD and TEM reveal a high dispersion of Rh nanoparticles (~1 nm) on the surface of TiO2 support by the introduction of CeO2. It was found that the relative content of Rh and CeO2 imposes significant influence on the catalytic behavior, and the sample of 1 wt% Rh-1 wt% CeO 2/TiO2 exhibits the highest CO conversion (32 %) and the largest ethanol selectivity (33 %) under the conditions of 573 K, 3 MPa, H 2:CO = 2:1. H2-TPR and XPS results confirm a gradually enhanced electron interaction between Rh and CeO2 with the increase of Ce content; CO-TPD further reveals that the Rh-CeO2 interaction generates a new adsorption site for CO, accounting for the improved selectivity towards ethanol. Therefore, this work provides a facile and effective method for the preparation of Rh-CeO2/TiO2 catalysts with high catalytic behavior, which can be potentially used in syngas conversion to ethanol.

        "abstract": "The fabrication of fluorescence indicator/layered double hydroxide (LDH) ultrathin films (UTFs) by alternate assembly of Primuline and Mg-Al LDH nanosheets using the layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition technique has been reported, and their application as a raitometric fluorescence chemosensor for Hg2+ is demonstrated. The Primuline/LDH UTFs show a stepwise and regular growth of upon increasing deposition cycles proved by UV-vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectroscopy, and a periodical layered structure perpendicular to the substrates with a thickness of 2.41-2.48 nm per bilayer observed by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, a linear correlation between the fluorescence intensity ratio (I 422/I377) of the UTF and the concentration of Hg 2+ is obtained (I422/I377 = 2.63-0.01c nM, r2 = 0.99), with a detection limit of 0.13 pM. The results have also exhibited that the ratiometric fluorescence chemosensor possess a good repeatability, high stability (light, storage and mechanics) as well as excellent selectivity. In addition, the mechanism of measurement-regeneration cycle for the ratiometric fluorescence chemosensor indicates Hg2+ enters/departs from the Primuline/LDH UTF giving rise to reversible change in chemical composition, surface morphology and fluorescence anisotropy of the UTF. Therefore, this work provides new opportunities for fabrication and application of chromophore/LDH UTFs as ratiometric fluorescence chemosensors. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

        "title": "Theoretical study on the reaction mechanism and selectivity of acetylene semi-hydrogenation on Ni-Sn intermetallic catalysts.",
        "abstract": "Recently, Ni-Sn intermetallic compounds (IMCs) with unique geometric structures have been proved to be selective catalysts for acetylene hydrogenation to ethylene, but the origin of the selectivity remains unclear. In this work, a density functional theory (DFT) study has been carried out to investigate the mechanism of acetylene hydrogenation on six surfaces of Ni-Sn IMCs, and the geometric effects towards ethylene selectivity were revealed. Two key parameters (adsorption energy and the hydrogenation barrier of ethylene), which determine the ethylene selectivity, were studied quantitatively. The adsorption sites for C2Hy (y = 2, 3, 4) can be classified into three types: Type 1 (Ni3Sn(111) and Ni3Sn2(101)-2) with Ni trimers, Type 2 (Ni3Sn(001) and Ni3Sn2(001)) with Ni monomers, and Type 3 (Ni3Sn2(101) and Ni3Sn2(001)-2) with reconstructed metal trimers. The adsorption energy (Ead) decreases following the order: Type 1 > Type 3 > Type 2, which indicates that the adsorption strength depends significantly on site ensemble: a more isolated Ni site would facilitate the desorption of ethylene. However, the surface roughness mainly dominates the hydrogenation barrier of ethylene. Either low or high roughness decreases the interactions between H and C2H4 (Eint), resulting in an enhanced energy barrier for over-hydrogenation of C2H4 (Ea,hydr); while moderate roughness benefits Eint and lowers Ea,hydr. The selectivity to ethylene is denoted as \u0394Ea = Ea,hydr - |Ead|, thus depending on the interplay of site ensemble effects and surface roughness. From this point of view, Ni3Sn(001) and Ni3Sn2(101) surfaces with well-isolated Ni ensembles and low (or high) surface roughness exhibit decreased |Ead| and increased Ea,hydr, giving rise to excellent selectivity to ethylene. This work provides significant understanding of the origin of ethylene selectivity in terms of geometric effects, which gives helpful instruction for the design and preparation of intermetallic catalysts for acetylene semi-hydrogenation.",

Development of highly selective, efficient and economical catalysts towards H2 generation from hydrogen storage materials (e.g., hydrous hydrazine, N2H4\ufffd\ufffdH 2O) has been one of the most active research areas. In this work, a bifunctional NiFe-alloy/MgO catalyst containing both an active center and a solid base center was obtained via a calcination-reduction process of NiFeMg-layered double hydroxides (LDHs) precursor, which exhibits 100% conversion of N2H4\ufffd\ufffdH2O and up to 99% selectivity towards H2 generation at room temperature, comparable to the most reported noble metal catalysts (e.g., Rh, Pt). The XRD, HRTEM and HAADF-STEM results confirm that well-dispersed NiFe alloy nanoparticles (NPs) with diameters of \ufffd\ufffd22 nm were embedded in a thermally stable MgO matrix. The EXAFS verifies the electronic interaction between nickel and iron elements in NiFe alloy NPs, accounting for the significantly enhanced low-temperature activity. The CO2-TPD results indicate that the strong basic sites on the surface of the NiFe-alloy/MgO catalyst contribute to the high H2 selectivity. ? 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a systematic study on the intercalation of an unstable chiral drug L-dopa into layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and the enhancement of its chemical and stereochemical stabilities through host-guest interactions, by virtue of combining experimental and theoretical investigations. L-Dopa has been intercalated into a magnesium-aluminum LDH, and the structural characterization reveals that L-dopa anions are accommodated vertically in the interlayer region as a monolayer of partially superimposed species. Thermogravimetry-mass spectroscopy and polarimetry indicate that both the chemical and stereochemical stabilities of L-dopa are enhanced significantly in a confined region between LDH sheets compared with pristine L-dopa. The racemization phenomenon of pristine L-dopa has been rationalized by quantum mechanical calculations at the B3PW91/6-31G(d,p) level. The computed results suggest that in the solid state L-dopa undergoes racemization via an enol intermediate formed by hydrogen transfer from the chiral carbon atom to the carboxylate group. After intercalation in the interlayer galleries of the LDH, the carboxylate group of the L-dopa becomes involved in strong host-guest interactions with the layers, with the computed binding energy of L-dopa to the LDH layers being ca. -1100 kJ/mol. The host-guest interactions, including electrostatic and hydrogen bonding between L-dopa and LDH host, thus inhibit the racemization reaction of the guest because the carboxylate group is no longer able to act as a hydrogen acceptor. Therefore, the results of theoretical study are in good agreement with those of the experimental ones. The results show that these layered materials have potential applications as the basis of a novel storage and delivery system for L-dopa or other unstable chiral pharmaceutical agents. \u00a9 2008 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "A visible-light responsive photocatalyst was fabricated by anchoring NiTi-layered double hydroxide (NiTi-LDH) nanosheets to the surface of reduced graphene oxide sheets (RGO) via an in situ growth method; the resulting NiTi-LDH/RGO composite displays excellent photocatalytic activity toward water splitting into oxygen with a rate of 1.968 mmol g(-1) h(-1) and a quantum efficiency as high as 61.2% at 500 nm, which is among the most effective visible-light photocatalysts. XRD patterns and SEM images indicate that the NiTi-LDH nanosheets (diameter: 100-200 nm) are highly dispersed on the surface of RGO. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy exhibits that the introduction of RGO enhances the visible-light absorption range of photocatalysts, which is further verified by the largely decreased band gap (\u223c1.78 eV) studied by cyclic voltammetry measurements. Moreover, photoluminescence (PL) measurements indicate a more efficient separation of electron-hole pairs; electron spin resonance (ESR) and Raman scattering spectroscopy confirm the electrons transfer from NiTi-LDH nanosheets to RGO, accounting for the largely enhanced carrier mobility and the resulting photocatalytic activity in comparison with pristine NiTi-LDH material. Therefore, this work demonstrates a facile approach for the fabrication of visible-light responsive NiTi-LDH/RGO composite photocatalysts, which can be used as a promising candidate in solar energy conversion and environmental science.",

The XRD pattern for the film indicates a long-range stacking order in the normal direction of the substrate. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the MFA LDH/Mn-TPPS UTFs reveal a continuous and uniform surface morphology. Cyclic voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy, and chronoamperometry were used to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the film, and the results show that the MFA-0.5 (0.5 T magnetic field) CoFe-LDH/Mn-TPPS-modified electrode displays the strongest redox current peaks and fastest electron transfer process compared with those of MFA-0 (without magnetic-field) and MFA-0.15 (0.15 T magnetic field). Furthermore, the MFA-0.5 CoFe-LDH/Mn-TPPS exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of glucose with a linear response range (0.1-15 mM; R(2) = 0.999), low detection limit (0.79 \u03bcM) and high sensitivity (66.3 \u03bcA mM(-1) cm(-2)). In addition, the glucose sensor prepared by the MFA LBL method also shows good selectivity and reproducibility as well as resistance to poisoning in a chloride ion solution. Therefore, the novel strategy in this work creates new opportunities for the fabrication of nonenzyme sensors with prospective applications in practical detection.",

        "abstract": "High-density vertically aligned ZnO nanotube arrays were fabricated on FTO substrates by a simple and facile chemical etching process from electrodeposited ZnO nanorods. The nanotube formation was rationalized in terms of selective dissolution of the (001) polar face. The morphology of the nanotubes can be readily controlled by electrodeposition parameters for the nanorod precursor. By employing the 5.1 microm-length nanotubes as the photoanode for a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), a full-sun conversion efficiency of 1.18% was achieved. Furthermore, we show that the DSSC unit can serve as a robust power source to drive a humidity sensor, with a potential for self-powered devices.",

        "abstract": "Luminescent benzocarbazole anions (BCZC) intercalated into the interlayer region of Mg-Al-layered double hydroxides (BCZC/LDH) with different layered charge densities (LCD) were prepared. The structure and chemical composition of the composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), infrared spectra (FT-IR), UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. The photoemission behavior of BCZC in the LDH matrix with high (Mg/Al ratio = 1.801) and low (Mg/Al ratio = 3.132) LCD is similar to that of BCZC solid and aqueous solution states respectively, indicating that the luminescence performances of the intercalated dye anions can be tuned by adjusting the LCD of the LDH layer. Moreover, the thermal stability and stacking order of BCZC are largely improved upon intercalation, and the BCZC/LDH thin film exhibits well polarized luminescence with the luminescent anisotropy of 0.15-0.20. In addition, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was employed to calculate the basal spacing and molecular arrangement of the intercalated BCZC within the LDH matrix. The simulation results show that the distribution of BCZC anions is much broader in the gallery of Mg-Al-LDH with high LCD, while BCZC anions exhibit a more ordered arrangement in LDH with low LCD. Furthermore, the radial distribution functions of interlayer water molecules were also studied. Based on the combination of experiment and theoretical simulation, this work provides a detailed understanding of the tunable photoluminescence, orientation and diffusion behavior of the luminescent molecules confined within the gallery of a 2D inorganic matrix.",

        "abstract": "Recently, theranostic has drawn tremendous attention by virtue of the nanotechnology development and new material exploration. Herein, we reported a novel theranostic system by loading Au nanoclusters (AuNCs) and Chlorin e6 (photosensitizer, Ce6) onto the monolayer nanosheet surface of Gd-doped layered double hydroxide (Gd-LDH). The as-prepared Ce6&AuNCs/Gd-LDH exhibits a largely enhanced fluorescence quantum yield (QY) of 18.5% relative to pristine AuNCs (QY\u202f=\u202f3.1%) as well as superior T1 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performance (r1\u202f=\u202f17.57\u202fmM\u22121s\u22121) compared with commercial MRI contrast agent (Gd(III)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (Gd-DOTA): r1\u202f\u2248\u202f3.4\u202fmM\u22121s\u22121), resulting from a synergistic effect between AuNCs and Gd-LDH. In addition, both in vitro and in vivo therapeutic evaluations demonstrate an efficient dual-modality imaging guided anticancer performance, especially the synergetic enhanced magnetic resonance/fluorescence (MR/FL) visualization of tumor site. Therefore, this work demonstrates a successful paradigm for the design and preparation of LDHs monolayer-based theranostic material, which holds great promises in practical applications.",

The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) of \u03b1-NAA LDH and \u03b2-NAA LDH confirm the intercalation of guests between sheets of LDH. The XRD and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of \u03b1-NAA LDH and \u03b2-NAA LDH thin films show that they are well c-oriented assembly with platelet-like morphology. UV - vis absorption and fluorescence spectra (emission, lifetime, and time resolution) indicate that the intercalated NAA is accommodated in its monomer form and depolarization factors exhibit no influence on its fluorescence emission process, which makes the evaluation for its interlayer molecular orientation reasonable and feasible by polarized fluorescence method. Fluorescence polarization method was applied to investigate the preferential orientation of the interlayer \u03b1-NAA and \u03b2-NAA molecules, and the results show that \u03b1-NAA and \u03b2-NAA are intercalated between sheets of Zn2Al LDH as monomeric units with a tilt angle \u03a8 (defined as the angle between the transition moment of NAA molecule with respect to the normal to the LDH layer) of 60\u00b0 and 65\u00b0, respectively. Compared with the physical mixture samples of NAA and LDH, the intercalation of NAA leads to an increase in the fluorescence lifetime. This indicates a more dilute and constrained interlayer environment for the guest, which reduces the internal mobility and the flexibility of NAA and thus improves its fluorescence lifetime. \u00a9 2008 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Amphiphilic block copolymer, poly(tert-butyl acrylate-co-ethyl acrylate-co-methacrylic acid), was well established as building block for the preparation of negatively charged micelle, which contains hydrophobic drug prednisone (PNS) in the core. The micelle was further intercalated into galleries of magnesium\u2013aluminum layered double hydroxide (LDH) for the study of drug carrier and release behavior. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and UV\u2013vis spectroscopy indicate a successful intercalation of PNS-containing micelle between the LDH layers. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image shows that the as-synthesized drug/polymer\u2013LDH composite exhibits compact microspheres morphology. The release behavior at different pH values was studied in detail, and it was found that the release rate increases with the increase of pH value. Studies on mathematical modeling of drug release show that the system approaches a release mechanism described by approximately Fickian diffusion at pH 7.2 and exhibits anomalous transport at pH 6.4, while it shows the combination of diffusion through the matrix and degradation of the micelle at pH 4.8. The controlled release formulations in this work indicate that this drug-containing composite has potential application in the field of site-specific drug delivery to the colon (pH 7.2), taking advantage of the long transit time and almost complete release.",

Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements reveal that Ti sites are generated within these nanosized LDH platelets. The data show that the concentration of Ti cations in the nanoplatelets is size-dependent, the 40 nm nanoplatelets have a bandgap of ca. 2.3 eV. The combination of photochemcially activity and nanoparticle size results in materials that exhibit high antipathogen activity under visible light. The biocidal efficacies of the LDHs have been investigated under visible light. The ZnTi-LDHs display size-dependent cytotoxicity against S. cerevisiae, S. aureus and E. coli in culture. The 40 nm ZnTi-LDH nanoplatelets (ZnTi-LDH-RM1) are the most potent resulting in 95% cell death. These nanoplatelets are more active compared to a conventionally prepared ZnTi-LDH or the nanoparticulate metal oxides WO and TiO (P25). The nanosized ZnTi-LDHs severely inhibit the growth of S. cerevisiae, S. aureus and E. coli in culture.",

Based on the measurement results of XRD, Raman and FT-IR, it was found that the interlayer l -Cys was oxidized to cystine by Fe(CN) 6 3\u2212 . Furthermore, the kinetics of this reaction was investigated in batch mode. The influences of initial Fe(CN) 6 3\u2212 concentration, l -Cys-LDH quantity and reaction temperature on the interlayer oxidation reaction have been studied, respectively. The reaction follows a diffusion-controlled mechanism represented by Crank-Ginstling and Brounshtein kinetic model with the apparent activation energy of 29.93 kJ/mol. Therefore, this layered material may have prospective application as a novel \u201cmolecular reactor\u201d for confined chemical reactions.",

        "abstract": "The [M2Al(OH2)9(OH)4]3+ clusters (M = divalent cation Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, or Cd2+), which include the basic information of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) lattice structure with the most economical size, have been investigated by density functional theory (DFT) to shed light on the structural properties and relative stability of M(II)-Al binary LDHs layers with a M2+/Al3+ ratio of 2. The geometric parameters (bond distance and bond angle), natural bond orbitals (NBO), stretching vibration frequencies of three-centered bridging OH groups (nu(O3-H)), as well as binding energy of the cluster model were systematically studied. It was found that the geometries and the nu(O3-H) frequency for the calculated clusters are remarkably influenced by the electronic structure of the divalent cations, such as valence electronic configuration, natural bond orbitals, natural charge transfer, and bond order. The calculated binding energies are in good agreement with the relative stability of the experimental results for the corresponding LDHs. The calculation results reveal that the 2Ni-Al cluster shows the highest stability among the open-shelled cation-containing clusters, while the stability of the 2Cu-Al cluster is the weakest; the 2Mg-Al and 2Zn-Al clusters are the most stable ones among the closed-shelled cation-containing clusters. These findings are in high accordance with the experimental results. Therefore, this work provides a detailed understanding of how the electronic structure of cations plays a more significant role in the structural properties and relative stability of the corresponding LDHs layers rather than ionic size.",

The adsorption isotherms of enantioselective as well as non-enantioselective adsorption of PED by CMCD-LDH film have been investigated, and it was found that the Langmuir-Freundlich and Freundlich model can be, respectively, used to describe the two different adsorptions satisfactorily. Furthermore, the plane sheet diffusion model was successfully validated in this work. Diffusivities (D) of PED in CMCD-LDH film were determined from the Fickian diffusion model at various temperatures.

        "abstract": "The regular assembly of organic chromophores into ordered supramolecular solids has received much attention for developing high-performance luminescent materials. Herein, a fluorenone-containing dicarboxylate (FDC) has been organized into a metal organic framework (MOF) with zinc as the metal cation by a facile mechanochemical synthesis method. The obtained Zn-FDC MOF features a pillared structure, in which the fluorenone chromophore units exhibit a highly ordered arrangement. Compared with the pristine FDC sample, the Zn-FDC MOF presents blue-shifted emission, as well as enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime, demonstrating the ordered arrangement of the FDC within the MOF is beneficial for the improvement of the photo-related properties of the organic chromophore. Moreover, the Zn-FDC MOF film exhibits well-defined polarized photoemission with a polarized anisotropy of 0.10-0.15. Periodic density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations illustrate that no energy/electronic transfer occurs between the chromophore and the metal cation, and the valence electrons localized in the FDC are confined effectively due to the energy blocking action of the metal cations. Combining experimental and theoretical studies on the luminescent MOF system, this work not only gives a rapid and environmentally friendly way to prepare a highly ordered inorganic-organic hybrid system with improved fluorescence properties, but also provides a deep understanding of the electronic structure of the 2D pillared MOF. It is expected that the Zn-FDC MOF can be potentially applied as a polarized fluorescence material. This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.",

        "abstract": "The assembly of an organic dye molecule incorporated into inorganic host matrices has received considerable attention for developing new types of organic-inorganic hybrid photofunctional materials. In this work, we report 9-fluorenone-2,7-dicarboxylate (FDC) assembled into Mg-Al- and Zn-Al-layered double hydroxide (LDH) systems and their solid-state photophysical properties. The detailed structure and chemical compositions of the obtained composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), infrared spectra (IR) and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which show that the positively-charged LDH layer can delocalize the electronic density of the anionic FDC to some extent. Moreover, FDC/LDH systems exhibit a blue-shift photoemission and enhanced fluorescence lifetime compared with those of the pristine FDC sample, and the FDC/LDH thin films exhibit well-defined polarized luminescence with the fluorescence anisotropy of 0.15-0.25. In addition, a periodic density functional theoretical (DFT) calculation was employed to calculate the geometric and electronic structures of the FDC/LDH systems. It was found that the FDC/LDH can be regarded as energy transfer systems from the interlayer organic chromophore to the inorganic host layer due to close energy levels between two components. Therefore, based on the combination of experimental and theoretical studies on the chromophore assembled LDH systems, this work not only gives a detailed investigation on the relationship between the layered host-guest structures and photoluminescence properties, but also provides a new insight into the energy-transfer performance of guest dye molecules confined between the 2D inorganic host matrix.

        "abstract": "Optically transparent thin films with thermochromic properties have been fabricated by means of cointercalation of different molar ratios of 4-(4-anilinophenylazo)benzenesulfonate (AO5) and sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDS) into the galleries of a ZnAl layered double hydroxide (LDH). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of these thin films show that they are assembled in a highly c-oriented manner, and the basal spacing ranges from 2.95 to 2.63 nm with varying AO5/SDS molar ratio. The preferential orientation of AO5 in the galleries of 10% AO5-LDH (AO5/SDS = 10:90, molar percentage) was evaluated by the fluorescence polarization technique; the results show that AO5 anions are accommodated between sheets of ZnAl-LDH as monomeric units with a tilt angle Psi (defined as the angle between the transition dipole moment of the AO5 anion with respect to the normal to the LDH layer) of 74 degrees. It was found that the composite film exhibits marked thermochromic behavior (light yellow <==> reddish-orange) in the temperature range of 35-65 degrees C, which is reversible over a number of heating-cooling cycles. It has been demonstrated that the thermochromic behavior results from tautomerism of interlayer AO5 and furthermore that both the host-guest and guest-guest interactions are key factors, since pristine AO5 shows no thermochromic performance. The 10% AO5-LDH film shows the highest thermochromic efficiency of all the films examined. Furthermore, a reversible contraction and expansion of the LDH basal spacing was also observed for this thin film over the same temperature range.",

The SEM and TEM images revealed that the obtained microspheres display a three-dimensional architecture with core-shell, yolk-shell, and hollow interior structure respectively, with continuous changes in specific surface area and pore-size distribution. Moreover, the hollow NiAl-LDH microspheres exhibit excellent pseudocapacitance performance, including high specific capacitance and rate capability, good charge/discharge stability and long-term cycling life, owing to the greatly improved faradaic redox reaction and mass transfer.

        "abstract": "l-Tyrosine (represented as l-Tyr) intercalated MgAl, NiAl and ZnAl layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been obtained by the method of coprecipitation. In situ FT-IR, in situ HT-XRD and TG-DTA measurements allow a detailed understanding of the thermal decomposition process for the three intercalated composites. In situ HT-XRD reveals that the layered structure of l-Tyr/MgAl-LDH collapses completely at 450 \u00b0C with the first appearance of reflections of a cubic MgO phase, while the corresponding temperature for l-Tyr/NiAl-LDH is some 50 \u00b0C lower. In contrast, there is a major structural change in l-Tyr/ZnAl-LDH at 250 \u00b0C as shown by the disappearance of its (0 0 6) and (0 0 9) reflections at this temperature accompanied by the appearance of reflections of ZnO. In situ FT-IR experiments give information about the decomposition of the interlayer -Tyr ions. The decomposition temperature of l-Tyr in the ZnAl host is about 50 \u00b0C lower than the corresponding values for the MgAl and NiAl hosts. TG-DTA curves show a significant weight loss step (170-260 \u00b0C) in l-Tyr/ZnAl-LDH which is due to the dehydroxylation of the host layers, with a corresponding weak endothermic peak at 252 \u00b0C. This temperature range is much lower than that observed for MgAl and NiAl hosts, indicating that the ZnAl-LDH layers are relatively unstable. The data indicate that the order of thermal stability of the three intercalates is: l-Tyr/MgAl-LDH > l-Tyr/NiAl-LDH > l-Tyr/ZnAl-LDH. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "While organic micro/nanostructures for optoelectronic applications have attracted increasing recent attention, the assembly of aligned micro/nanostructure arrays continues to be a challenge. Herein, a one-dimensional (1D) microbelt has been fabricated by a hydrogen bonding assembly strategy with guanidinium cations and stilbene-based sulfonate anions as the building blocks. X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy demonstrate that the microbelt possesses a periodic layered structure with guanidinium cations and anionic stilbene-based chromophores regularly assembled within the microcrystal. The individual 1D microbelts show enhanced luminescent properties compared with pure stilbene-based units, with strong blue emission with a photoluminescent quantum yield of 46% and fluorescence lifetime of 2.8 ns, as well as well-defined polarized luminescence (an anisotropy value of 0.71). Moreover, a macroscopic 1D microbelt array can be fabricated by means of the spontaneous alignment of individual microbelts resulting from an evaporation-induced deposition process. The regularly oriented microbelt array maintains a uniform and highly polarized fluorescence and also exhibits both strong two-photon emission and an interesting second-harmonic response upon excitation with near-infrared laser pulses. Therefore, this work provides a procedure for the facile bottom-up self-assembly of highly ordered 1D organic microcrystal and microarray structures with high luminescent efficiency as well as polarized emission, which have potential applications in the areas of light displays, polarized thin films, frequency doubling materials and miniaturized optoelectronic devices. \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.",

        "abstract": "LiCoO2 precursors of the cathode material for lithium-ion batteries were prepared from lithium hydroxide, basic cobalt carbonate and citric acid by a sol-gel method. The LiCoO2 samples were obtained by sintering the gel precursors at different temperatures and for different times. The thermal decomposition behavior of the gel precursors was examined by means of thermo-gravimetric analysis and differential thermal analysis using a PCT-IA thermal analyzer system. Their structures and morphologies were characterized by powder XRD and SEM techniques. It was found that using citric acid realized that the formation of LiCoO2 crystal can be clearly differentiated to the nucleation and growth processes of the crystals; furthermore, the crystal size can be controlled. Electrochemical tests using the LAND BT1-10 test system showed the electrochemical performance of the material is affected by its integrity and stability.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a systematic study on the thermal polymerization of both pristine 4-vinylbenzenesulfonic anion (VBS) and intercalated VBS in the two-dimensional (2D) gallery of Ni-Al layered double hydroxide (VBS/Ni-Al-LDH), by virtue of combining experimental and theoretical investigations. In situ FT-IR, in situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD), UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, TG-DTA and elemental analysis were used to study the polymerization process, and it was found that the polymerization of VBS/Ni-Al-LDH occurs at ca. 150-170 degrees C, at least 40 degrees C lower than that of the pristine VBS, indicating that the layered structure of LDH is favorable for thermal polymerization of VBS. Therefore, this layered inorganic material may have potential application as a \"molecular reactor\" for enhancing the efficiency of polymerization reaction. Furthermore, the sheet-like polymerization product was obtained with the LDHs lamella as template. For better understanding the structure and arrangement of intercalated VBS and the polymerization product between the layers of Ni-Al-LDH, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation method was employed. The simulation results of hydration energies show that there are two relatively stable stages upon the increase of the number of interlayer water molecules. VBS molecules exhibit a tendency from tilted to vertical orientation with respect to the layers as the interlayer water content increases. Compared with the experimental results, the calculated interlayer spacing is more severely affected by interlayer water content. Finally, a typical tetramer product of VBS intercalated LDH was studied and the simulated equilibrium interlayer spacing is consistent with the experimental result of in situ HT-XRD. Based on the combination of experimental and theoretical studies on the interlayer polymerization system, the aim of this work is to deeply investigate the differences in thermal polymerization process between pristine monomers and intercalated ones in the gallery of LDHs, and to give detailed information of the arrangement and swelling behavior of guest molecules confined between the sheets of host layers.",

In the case\n of ZrO-MnO2, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) determination indicates that the Zr atom locates between the MnO2 layers forming a stable structure. Compared with the precursor, the cycling property of M-MnO2 was improved distinctly, while the capacity decreased to some degree due to the strong interaction between pillars and the\n host matrix.

        "abstract": "Oriented Mg/Al-NO 3-layered double hydroxide (LDH) films have been fabricated by the electrophoretic deposition method (EPD) on aluminum substrate, which can be used to remove heavy metal ion and anionic dye from aqueous solutions. The LDH films with thickness of \u223c4 \u03bcm by EPD method show a high degree of c-orientation of the LDH platelets (the ab-plane parallel to the substrate) and strong adhesion to the substrate confirmed by XRD and SEM. The sorption kinetics of the LDH film for Cr(VI) and Remazol Brilliant Blue R dye (RBBR) was appropriately described by the pseudo-second-order model. Sorption isotherms for Cr(VI) and RBBR by the LDH film were studied, which can be fitted by the Langmuir model more satisfactorily than by the Freundlich model. It was found that the sorption capacity (q MAX) reached \u223c79.4 mg g -1 for Cr(VI) and \u223c222 mg g -1 for RBBR respectively, much larger than that of the corresponding LDH powder sample (\u223c67.6 mg g -1 for Cr(VI) and \u223c192.3 mg g -1 for RBBR, respectively). Furthermore, the LDH film exhibits excellent sorption-regeneration performances as compared to the powder sample, which facilitates its repeatable and cyclic usage over a long period. Because of the low-cost preparation, high sorption capacity, convenient manipulation, as well as easy regeneration of the LDH film, it is expected that this film can be potentially used as a structured adsorbent in the field of water treatment. \u00a9 2011 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "This article reports a novel method to assemble a small anion with exfoliated Mg-Al-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets into ordered ultrathin films (UTFs) by employing the layer-by-layer assembly technique. The premixing solution of tris(8-hydroxyquinolate-5-sulfonate)aluminum(III) (AQS(3-)) with three kinds of polyanions-poly(acrylic acid), ((C(3)H(4)O(2))(n), PAA), poly(styrene 4-sulfonate) ([CH(2)CH(C(6)H(4))SO(3)](m), PSS), and poly[5-methoxy-2-(3-sulfopropoxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene] (C(12)H(13)O(5)S)(n), PPV)-has been used as building blocks to assemble alternatively with LDH nanosheets. The UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy of (AQS-polyanion/LDH)(n) UTFs presents stepwise growth upon increasing deposited cycles in comparison with the (AQS/LDH)(n) film under the same experimental process. (AQS-PPV/LDH)(n) UTF displays complex fluorescence originating from AQS and PPV. The (AQS/LDH)(n) and (AQS-polyanion/LDH)(n) UTFs exhibit higher blue-polarized photoemission character with a luminescence anisotropy (r) of ca. 0.12-0.20 and a longer fluorescence lifetime than that of the Na(3)AQS film with r = 0.04. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy demonstrated that the UTFs were orderly periodically layered structures with a thickness of ca. 3.0 nm per bilayer. Therefore, this work gives a feasible method for immobilizing small anions into the gallery of LDHs.",

UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectra demonstrate a stepwise and regular growth of the films upon increasing the number of deposition cycles. XRD, AFM and SEM indicate that the films possess a periodic layered and uniform surface morphology. In contrast to the disordered LDH/PVA/BTBS film prepared by a solvent evaporation method, the (LDH/PVA/LDH/BTBS)n films with ordered structures exhibit enhanced magnetic and optical properties, including higher saturation magnetization, longer luminescence lifetime and stronger polarized photoemission. Moreover, owing to the highly arrayed 2D-organized structure formed through LBL assembly, the presence of the free-standing film means that the alignment of the spins of the LDH nanoplatelets in random directions is avoided and imparts a high level of dispersion and orientation to the BTBS, which displays enhanced magnetic and luminescent anisotropy. Therefore, this work provides a facile method for the fabrication of anisotropic 2D-organized materials based on the LDH/PVA/LDH/BTBS system, which can be potentially used in magneto-optical sensors, magnetic data storage and magneto-resistive devices. \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.",

        "abstract": "CoMn-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanowalls were supported on flexible carbon fibers (CFs) via an in situ growth approach; the resulting CoMn-LDH/CF electrode delivers a high specific capacitance (1079 F g-1 at 2.1 A g-1 normalized to the weight of the active LDH material) with excellent rate capability even at high current densities (82.5% capacitance retention at 42.0 A g-1). A combined experimental and theoretical study reveals that the dramatic performance enhancement is mainly attributed to the homogeneous and ordered dispersion of metal units within the LDH framework, which enriches the redox reactions associated with charge storage by both Co and Mn. The hierarchical configuration further improves the exposure of active sites and enables a fast charge transfer to the electrode/electrolyte interface, with CFs serving as both the current collector and binderless electrode. In addition, a solid-state supercapacitor device with good flexibility was fabricated using the CoMn-LDH/CFs, which achieves a specific energy up to 126.1 W h kg-1 and a specific power of 65.6 kW kg-1. By virtue of rational design of the chemical composition and architecture, this work demonstrates a facile strategy for the fabrication of a hierarchical configuration based on CoMn-LDH nanowalls anchored to CFs, which can be potentially used in wearable and miniaturized devices for energy storage. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "The development of \ufffd\ufffd-conjugated molecular systems with high-efficiency generation of UV and blue light plays an important role in the fields of light-emitting diodes, fluorescent imaging, and information storage. Herein, supramolecular construction of solid-state UV/blue luminescent materials are assembled using 2,5-diphenyloxazole (DPO) with four typical co-assembled building blocks (1,4-diiodotetrafluorobenzene, 4-bromotetrafluorobenzene carboxylic acid, pentafluorophenol, and octafluoronaphthalene). Compared with the pristine DPO sample, the as-prepared two-component molecular materials feature ease of crystallization, high crystallinity, enhanced thermal stability and tunable luminescence properties (such as emissive wavelength, color, fluorescence lifetime, and photoluminescence quantum yield) as well as multicolor polarized emission in the UV/blue region. Moreover, pump-enhanced luminescence and reversible mechanochromic fluorescence (MCF) properties can also be obtained for these molecular solids, which are absent for the pristine DPO sample. Therefore, this work provides a procedure for the facile self-assembly of ordered two-component molecular materials with tunable UV/blue luminescence properties, which have potential application in the areas of light-emitting displays, polarized emission, frequency doubling, and luminescent sensors. By the formation of two-component molecular solids, 2,5-diphenyloxazole (DPO)-based crystalline materials exhibit tunable polarized emission, pump-enhanced luminescence, and mechanochromic response in the UV/blue region, which is absent for the pristine DPO sample. ? 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

        "title": "Density functional theory study on the influence of cation ratio on the host layer structure of Zn/Al double hydroxides",
        "abstract": "A density functional theory (DFT) study has been carried out for [Zn n \u22121 Al(OH 2 ) n +6 (OH) 2 n \u22122 ] 3+ ( n = 3\u20136) and [Zn n \u22121 Al(OH 2 ) 2 n \u22122 (OH) 2 n \u22122 ] 3+ ( n = 7) clusters, which include the basic structural information of the brucite-like lattice structure of Zn/Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with Zn/Al molar ratio ( R ) in the range 2\u20136, in order to understand the effect of the Zn/Al ratio on the structure and stability of binary Zn/Al LDHs. Based on systematic calculations of the geometric parameters and formation energies of the cluster models, it was found that it is possible for Zn 2+ and Al 3+ cations to replace Mg 2+ isomorphously in the brucite-like structure with different R values, resulting in differences in microstructure of the clusters and unit cell parameter a of the Zn/Al LDHs. Analysis of the geometry and bonding around the trivalent Al 3+ or divalent Zn 2+ cations reveals that Al 3+ plays a more significant role than Zn 2+ in determining the microstructure properties, formation and bonding stability of the corresponding Zn R Al clusters when R < 5, while the influence of Zn 2+ becomes the dominant factor in the case of R \u2265 5. These findings are in good agreement with experiments. This work provides a detailed electronic-level understanding of how the composition of cations affects the microstructure and stability of Zn-containing binary LDH layers.

The charge neutrality is ensured by interlayer anions that are easily exchangeable. The general formula of these compounds is [M 2+ 1\u2212 x M 3+ x (OH) 2 ] x + (A n \u2212 x / n )\u00b7 m H 2 O, where M 2+ and M 3+ are metal cations such as Mg 2+ , Ni 2+ , Mn 2+ , or Zn 2+ and Al 3+ , Ga 3+ , Fe 3+ or Cr 3+ that occupy octahedral positions in hydroxide layers; x is the molar ratio of the trivalent cation M 3+ /(M 2+ + M 3+ ), and A denotes interlayer charge-compensating anions ( Duan & Evans, 2006; Rives, 2001 ). The wide choice of composition for both the metal cations and the interlayer anions gives rise to numerous LDH compositions, both purely inorganic or hybrid inorganic\u2013organic phases. LDHs have received considerable attention due to their potential technological applications in the fields of catalysis ( Sels, de Vos, & Jacobs, 2005 ), as gene and molecular reservoirs ( Choy, Kwak, Park, Jeong, & Portier, 1999 ), optical materials ( Itoh et al., 2005 ), functional hybrid nanostructured materials ( Gursky et al., 2006 ), controlled drug-release systems ( Mohanambe & Vasudevan, 2005 ), and films ( Chen, Zhang, Fu, & Duan, 2006 ). Besides the best known Mg/Al LDHs, in recent years a great deal of attention has also focused on the development of Zn/Al hydrotalcite-like materials ( Chang et al., 2005; Vial, Ghanbaja, & Forano, 2006 ), stemming from their potential applications such as nanocomposite materials ( Cho, Jung, Jang, Oh, & Lee, 2008; Darder, L\u00f3pez-Blanco, Aranda, Leroux, & Ruiz-Hitzky, 2005; Liu et al., 2006 ), polymer nanofillers ( Illaik et al., 2008 ) and functional films ( Yarger, Steinmiller, & Choi, 2008; Zhang et al., 2008 ). The value of x , or the M 2+ /M 3+ ratio ( R ), plays an important role in the formation of the characteristic layered structure, since the charge density on the hydroxide layers of the LDH clearly depends on R . The anion-exchange capacity, and hence the number and arrangement of the charge-balancing anions in the LDH, may therefore be controlled by varying R ( Cavani et al., 1991 ). It is often said ( Duan & Evans, 2006 ) that pure LDH phases can only be formed for stoichiometries in the range 0.20 < x < 0.33, i.e. M 2+ /M 3+ ratios in the range 2\u20134. For Zn/Al LDHs, however, it has been claimed that at neutral pH by using the coprecipitation method, LDH phases can be obtained with Zn/Al ratio varying from 5 to 1 ( Barriga, Jones, Malet, Rives, & Ulibarri, 1998; Rojas, de Pauli, Barriga, & Avena, 2008 ). Understanding the properties and exploiting the chemistry of LDHs require a detailed knowledge of the structure. However, because of the inherently structural disorder and generally low crystallinity of LDHs, the determination of the complete LDH structure with different M 2+ /M 3+ ratios by X-ray diffraction is rarely possible. With recent advances in computational software and hardware, theoretical calculations are now capable of extending the scope of study of these materials beyond experimental observations. A number of force-field based simulations ( Aicken, Bell, Coveney, & Jones, 1997; Greenwell, Jones, Coveney, & Stackhouse, 2006; Hou, Kalinichev, & Kirkpatrick, 2002; Li et al., 2006; Lombardo, Pappalardo, Costantino, Costantino, & Sisani, 2008; Lombardo et al., 2005; Thyveetil, Coveney, Greenwell, & Suter, 2008 ) and quantum chemical calculations ( Greenwell, Stackhouse, Coveney, & Jones, 2003; Pu & Zhang, 2005; Refson, Park, & Sposito, 2003; Sainz-Diaz, Timon, Botella, & Hernandez-Laguna, 2000; Sato et al., 2003; Trave, Selloni, Goursot, Tichit, & Weber, 2002 ) have been reported for the study of some specific properties related to the interlayer anions and the electronic structure inside the LDH host layers. In our previous theoretical work ( Yan et al., 2008 ), the template-directed method was extended to the formation of LDH layers by using a series of cluster models, and further study has been carried out for the understanding of structural properties and relative stability of LDHs layer containing different divalent cations ( Yan et al., 2009 ). This finite cluster approach has been used many times in clay chemistry as has been documented in several reviews ( Sauer, 1989; Sauer, Ugliengo, Garonne, & Saunders, 1994 ), since it could handle accurate quantum computations for systematic energies and cluster structures. In this work, the structural properties and stability of a series of Zn R \u2013Al clusters ( R = 2\u20136) are studied in order to understand of the influence of the Zn/Al ratio on the structures and stability of the Zn/Al LDH layers. A series of clusters with formulae [Zn n \u22121 Al(OH 2 ) n +6 (OH) 2 n \u22122 ] 3+ ( n = 3\u20136, corresponding to R = 2\u20135) and [Zn n \u22121 Al(OH 2 ) 2 n \u22122 (OH) 2 n \u22122 ] 3+ ( n = 7, corresponding to R = 6), based on the characteristic octahedrally coordinated metal cations found in LDH layers, have been employed in the density functional theoretical study. These models are derived from our previous cluster models ([Mg n (OH 2 ) n +6 (OH) 2 n \u22122 ] 2+ ( n = 2\u20136)) for the formation of brucite ( Yan et al., 2008 ), by first substituting the Mg 2+ cations by Zn 2+ and subsequently replacing one of them by an Al 3+ ion. As a result, the cluster models can represent the ordered microstructure of the Zn/Al LDH layers with Zn/Al ratio R in the range 2\u20136 with the most economical size. In this paper, the geometric parameters (bond lengths, interatomic distances and bond angles) and formation energy of the cluster models are systematically discussed. 2 Computational details In order to carry out the theoretical study, it is necessary to choose an economical cluster model which includes the basic structural information. As referred to above, in the present work, the [Zn n \u22121 Al(OH 2 ) n +6 (OH) 2 n \u22122 ] 3+ ( n = 3\u20136) and [Zn n \u22121 Al(OH 2 ) 2 n \u22122 (OH) 2 n \u22122 ] 3+ ( n = 7) clusters are proposed to be the most practical model for understanding the Zn/Al LDH layers with Zn/Al ratio in the range 2\u20136. As shown in Fig. 1 , in these models, each bridging oxygen atom in the M\u2013O\u2013M angles is set to be bonded to one hydrogen atom (OH group), and the terminal oxygen atoms are set to be bonded to two hydrogen atoms (OH 2 group), to avoid the presence of unpaired electrons in the truncated ligands. Thus each model includes 2( n \u2212 1) OH groups at bridging positions and ( n + 6) OH 2 groups at terminal edges, except for the [Zn n \u22121 Al(OH 2 ) 2 n \u22122 (OH) 2 n \u22122 ] 3+ ( n = 7) cluster ( Fig. 1 (E)). These models are representative of the structure of the Zn/Al LDH crystal lattice since the results from XANES spectroscopy show that the Zn 2+ cation maintains an octahedral environment in the brucite-like layers, even though it is known to have some tendency to be tetrahedrally coordinated in other materials ( del Arco, Rives, Trujillano, & Malet, 1996 ). Theoretical calculations were carried out on the [Zn n \u22121 Al(OH 2 ) n +6 (OH) 2 n \u22122 ] 3+ ( n = 3\u20136) and [Zn n \u22121 Al(OH 2 ) 2 n \u22122 (OH) 2 n\u2013 2 ] 3+ ( n = 7) clusters (abbreviated hereafter as Zn R \u2013Al). The geometrical optimization for the cluster models was performed by density functional theory (DFT) with the three-parameter hybrid functional (B3LYP) ( Becke, 1988, 1993; Lee, Yang, & Parr, 1988 ). The effective core potential (ECP), LANL2DZ ( Hay & Wadt, 1985a, 1985b; Wadt & Hay, 1985 ), and the full electron basis sets, 6-31G(d) ( Petersson & Al-Laham, 1991 ), were employed for the metal ions and OH 2 ligands, respectively. The calculations were performed with the Gaussian 03 program suite ( Frisch et al., 2003 ). No constraints were imposed on the geometry in any of the computations. The attainment of the energy minimum of the structure in the full geometry optimization was tested by frequency calculations when R = 2 and 3 (i.e. n = 3 and 4). The reported energies were also corrected for zero-point energy (ZPE) when R = 2 and 3. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Geometry of the models The optimized structures of the Zn R \u2013Al ( R = 2\u20136) clusters with different Zn/Al ratios display different geometries with C1 symmetry. In the following discussion, we concentrate on the parts of the cluster which are linked around the bridging OH groups and are circled by dots in Fig. 1 . The optimized geometries of the calculated clusters such as average bond lengths, interatomic distances and bond angles are listed in Table 1 , along with the experimental data for LDHs. Fig. 1 and Table 1 show that the general geometry of the calculated Zn R \u2013Al ( R = 2\u20136) clusters is close to that of the octahedral layer of LDHs. The local geometries around the metal cations are distorted away from that of brucite (Mg(OH) 2 ) as a result of the substitution of Mg 2+ by Zn 2+ and Al 3+ . This leads to a decrease in the average metal\u2013oxygen distance Me\u2013O (0.2019\u20130.2083 nm), Me\u22efMe (0.3127\u20130.3190 nm) and O\u22efO MeMe (0.2600\u20130.2691 nm) distance compared with the corresponding values in brucite (0.2102 nm, 0.3142 nm, and 0.2787 nm for Mg\u2013O, Mg\u22efMg and O\u22efO, respectively) ( Zigan & Rothbauer, 1967 ), with the average O\u2013Me\u2013O bond angles (78.86\u201380.32\u00b0) being less distorted than those in brucite (83.30\u00b0). This result is consistent with the experimental findings that the bond lengths, interatomic distance and bond angles for LDH are all smaller than the corresponding values for brucite ( Rives, 2001 ). Good agreement was found between the theoretically calculated geometric parameters and the experimental values. The calculated Me\u2013O bond lengths, O\u22efO MeMe distances and O\u2013Me\u2013O bond angles are slightly shorter than the corresponding experimental ones, while the average Me\u22efMe distances are slightly longer than the experimental values. This may be due to the fact that the experimental values are derived from crystal data for LDHs, in which both the interactions between adjacent layers and the interaction between layers and interlayer anions are present. Indeed, the experimental Me\u22efMe distances vary for Zn/Al LDHs with the same R due to the different anions present. However, the calculated clusters only include the basic information about a single layer. On the other hand, the experimental crystal data obtained by diffraction techniques can only give the average values of parameters for Zn/Al LDH, since Zn and Al have effectively identical scattering power, making them indistinguishable by X-ray diffraction ( Ennadi, Legrouri, de Roy, & Besse, 2000a ). In this work, the cation arrangement is fixed; this allows us to obtain a detail understanding of the geometries around Zn 2+ or Al 3+ individually. Therefore, it is possible to investigate which cation plays a more significant role in determining the structural properties of the Zn R \u2013Al ( R = 2\u20136) clusters with different Zn/Al ratios. 3.1.1 Bond length, bond strength and bond angle Fig. 2 (A) illustrates the average bond lengths of the Zn R \u2013Al ( R = 2\u20136) clusters as a function of the Zn/Al ratio ( R ). All the Zn\u2013O (line (a)), Al\u2013O (line (b)) and Me\u2013O distances (line (c)) increase with increasing R (decreasing Al content). For the same R value, the Zn\u2013O distance is significantly longer than Al\u2013O as a consequence of the smaller ionic radius of Al 3+ , 0.0535 nm, as compared to that of Zn 2+ , 0.0740 nm ( Shannon, 1976 ). The Al\u2013O distance increases gradually when R < 5, while maintaining a nearly constant value from R = 5 to R = 6. On the other hand, the increase of the Zn\u2013O distance with R is much more uniform than that of the Al\u2013O distance. Comparing lines (a) and (b) with line (c) shows that the average metal\u2013oxygen bond length (Me\u2013O) is influenced more significantly by Al\u2013O, since the variation of Me\u2013O is closer to that of Al\u2013O. This indicates that the trivalent Al 3+ cation plays a more significant role than the divalent Zn 2+ cation in determining the average bond length (Me\u2013O) of the Zn R \u2013Al cluster, especially when R < 5. It is known that shorter bond lengths result in stronger bonds. Consequently, it is possible for us to analyze the bond strengths in the Zn R \u2013Al clusters by monitoring the relationship between the average metal\u2013oxygen bond length and R . Fig. 2 (A) shows that the metal\u2013oxygen bond strength becomes weaker with increasing R . In other words, the bonding around the cations should become more stable with decreasing R . This may imply that the pure Zn/Al LDH exists at relatively low R values. It can also be found from Fig. 2 (A) that the bond strength of Zn\u2013O is nearly constant from R = 2 to 6, while Al\u2013O rapidly becomes weaker with increasing R . These results show that the Al\u2013O distance dominates the bonding stability of the corresponding clusters, especially when R < 5. The average oxygen\u2013metal\u2013oxygen bond angles of the Zn R \u2013Al ( R = 2\u20136) clusters, which indicate the distortion of the octahedral layers, are displayed as a function of R in Fig. 2 (B). The O\u2013Zn\u2013O bond angles (line (a)) monotonically increase with increasing R . However, the O\u2013Al\u2013O bond angle (line (b)) fluctuates with increasing R with a minimum at R = 4. The O\u2013Zn\u2013O angle is smaller than the O\u2013Al\u2013O angle, suggesting the opposite relationship between the bond length and bond angle. Similar to the O\u2013Al\u2013O angle, the average O\u2013Me\u2013O angle fluctuates with increasing R , showing an inflection at R = 4, thus indicating that the trivalent Al 3+ cations make the major contribution to determining the oxygen\u2013metal\u2013oxygen bond angle in Zn R \u2013Al clusters. 3.1.2 Interatomic distances The average metal\u2013metal interatomic distances of the Zn R \u2013Al ( R = 2\u20136) clusters as a function of the Zn/Al ratio ( R ) are shown in Fig. 3 (A) . It is known that the average distance between two closest metal cations in the brucite-like layers is equivalent to the unit cell parameter a of LDH crystals ( Cavani et al., 1991 ). Therefore, the analysis of metal\u2013metal interatomic distances is helpful in understanding the structure of the corresponding LDHs. As displayed in Fig. 3 (A), the Zn\u22efZn distance (line (a)) is larger than the Zn\u22efAl distance (line (b)) for the same R . The Zn\u22efAl distance increases with increasing R , and the variation is more dramatic from R = 5 to 6 than from R = 2 to 5. However, the variation of the Zn\u22efZn distance is different from that of Zn\u22efAl, rising sharply to a maximum from R = 2 to 3 and then remaining nearly constant from R = 3 to 5, and then decreasing sharply from R = 5 to 6. The average metal\u2013metal interatomic distance Me\u22efMe increases gradually with R from 2 to 6, showing a similar upward trend to that of Zn\u22efAl. This trend is in accordance with reports that for samples prepared by coprecipitation, the a dimension of the unit cell steadily increased as the Zn/Al ratio was increased ( Barriga et al., 1998; Bonnet et al., 1996; Rojas et al., 2008; Seftel et al., 2008 ). This finding reveals that the geometry around Al 3+ plays a more important part in determining the Me\u22efMe distance, i.e. the unit cell parameter a . It is to be noted that the changes in Me\u22efMe distance from R = 3 to 6 are less evident than that from R = 2 to 3. When R = 6, the Me\u22efMe distances (0.3190 nm) are very close to that of Zn(OH) 2 (0.3194 nm), suggesting that when the Al 3+ content decreases sufficiently, the Zn 2+ cations become the dominant factor influencing the Zn n \u2013Al cluster, leading to a structure similar to that of Zn(OH) 2 . This can account for the experimental fact that pure LDHs were obtained only for Zn/Al ratios of 1\u20135; larger values lead to coprecipitation of zinc-containing impurities (ZnO and Zn(OH) 2 ) ( Barriga et al., 1998; Bonnet et al.,1996; Yarger et al., 2008 ). The O\u22efO distance is also closely related to the distortion of the LDH layers. The flattening of the octahedra brings about short O\u22efO distances in the shared octahedral edges, as shown in Fig. 3 (B). The O\u22efO distance across Zn\u22efZn (line (a)) fluctuates with R , while the O\u22efO distance across Zn\u22efAl (line (b)) increases from R = 2 to 5, and then decreases from R = 5 to 6. The O\u22efO distance across Zn\u22efZn is larger than that across Zn\u22efAl for the same value of R . On the other hand, the average O\u22efO distance (O\u22efO MeMe , line (c)) increases gradually with increasing R . This suggests that the trivalent cation plays a more significant role in determining the O\u22efO MeMe distance, especially when R < 5, since O\u22efO MeMe displays an upward trend from R = 5 to 6, which is similar to that of the O\u22efO distance across Zn\u22efZn but opposite to the trend for the O\u22efO distance across Zn\u22efAl. Based on the above discussion, it can be concluded that the trivalent Al 3+ cation plays a more significant role than the divalent Zn 2+ cation in determining the microstructure parameters of the calculated Zn R \u2013Al clusters especially when R < 5. This agrees well with the experimental observation that Zn/Al LDH phases can be obtained with Zn/Al ratios varying from 5 to 1 ( Barriga et al., 1998; Rojas et al., 2008 ). 3.2 Formation energy In order to investigate the influence of the Zn content on the formation of the clusters, the formation energy was calculated as the energy difference of the following reactions: (1) [Zn n \u22122 Al(OH 2 ) n +5 (OH) 2 n \u22124 ] 3+ + [Zn(OH 2 ) 6 ] 2+ + 2OH \u2212 \u2192 [Zn n \u22121 Al(OH 2 ) n +6 (OH) 2 n \u22122 ] 3+ + 5H 2 O ( n = 3\u20136), and (2) [Zn n \u22122 Al(OH 2 ) n +5 (OH) 2 n \u22124 ] 3+ + [Zn(OH 2 ) 6 ] 2+ + 2OH \u2212 \u2192 [Zn n \u22121 Al(OH 2 ) 2 n \u22122 (OH) 2 n \u22122 ] 3+ + 6H 2 O ( n = 7). The formation energy of the [Zn n \u22121 Al(OH 2 ) n +6 (OH) 2 n \u22122 ] 3+ ( n = 3\u20136) and [Zn n \u22121 Al(OH 2 ) 2 n \u22122 (OH) 2 n\u2013 2 ] 3+ ( n = 7) clusters can be obtained based on the equation: (3) \u0394 E f = E ( product ) \u2212 E ( reactant ) , where \u0394 E f denotes the formation energy of the Zn R \u2013Al ( R = 2\u20136) clusters, and E (product) and E (reactant) denote the optimized total energy of the products and reactants, respectively, in Eq. (1) or (2) . The formation energies and total energies of the calculated Zn R \u2013Al clusters are listed in Table 2 . The values E H 2 O = \u2212 76.4090 \u2009 a.u. , E H 2 O ( Z P E ) = \u2212 76.3878 \u2009 a.u. computed with 6-31G(d) basis sets (1 a.u. = 627.51 kcal/mol), and E [ Zn ( O H 2 ) 6 ] 2 + = \u2212 523.5 \u2009 a.u. , which represents the total energy of the [Zn(OH 2 ) 6 ] 2+ cluster, are adopted from our previous computations ( Yan et al., 2008 ). Fig. 4 illustrates the dependence of the formation energy of the Zn R \u2013Al clusters on the Zn/Al ratio ( R ). It can be seen that the formation energy changes only very slightly from R = 3 to 5 with an inflection when R = 4, while the increase is very obvious when R increases from 5 to 6. This indicates that the formation of the Zn R \u2013Al cluster from R = 3 to 5 is much more favorable than for R = 5 to 6. The formation energy of the Zn R \u2013Al clusters is similar when R is between 3 and 5. This also suggests that as the cluster size becomes larger and the Zn content becomes higher, the structure of the cluster becomes closer to Zn(OH) 2 and formation of the pure ZnAl-LDH phase becomes more difficult to sustain. The finding is also consistent with experiment, since it has been reported that low values of x lead to a high density of Zn octahedra in the brucite-like sheets, acting as nuclei for the formation of Zn(OH) 2 ( Barriga et al., 1998; Seftel et al., 2008 ). 4 Conclusions A series of density functional calculations for [Zn n \u22121 Al(OH 2 ) n +6 (OH) 2 n \u22122 ] 3+ ( n = 3\u20136) and [Zn n \u22121 Al(OH 2 ) 2 n \u22122 (OH) 2 n \u22122 ] 3+ ( n = 7) clusters have been performed at DFT/UB3LYP level, for the purpose of understanding the effect of varying Zn/Al ratios ( R ) on the structure and stability of Zn/Al binary LDH layers. The cluster models employed in this work include the basic information about the lattice structure of the Zn/Al LDH host layers while having the most economical size, with Zn/Al ratios in the range 2\u20136, and have succeeded in delineating the influences of the Zn/Al ratio on the structural properties and formation and bonding stability of the corresponding Zn/Al LDHs. It was found that both Zn 2+ and Al 3+ can isomorphically substitute Mg 2+ in the hydrotalcite-like structure. The formation or bonding stability of the corresponding Zn R \u2013Al ( R = 2\u20136) clusters decreases with increasing R . Different R values result in different microstructures of the clusters, and thus influence the variation of the unit cell parameter a of the LDH crystal. By analyzing the structural and bond properties of the Zn 2+ and Al 3+ cations separately, their individual contributions to the whole cluster is clearly presented. The trivalent Al 3+ cation plays a more significant role than the divalent Zn 2+ cation in determining the microstructure properties, formation and bonding stability of the corresponding Zn R \u2013Al ( R = 2\u20136) clusters, especially when R < 5. When R \u2265 5, the Zn 2+ cations occupy most of the cation sites of the cluster and the structure is closer to that of Zn(OH) 2 . These findings agree well with experimental results.

Scanning and transmission electron microscopy images reveal that the obtained microspheres display a three-dimensional architecture with hollow, yolk-shell and solid interior structure, respectively, with continuous changes in specific surface area and pore-size distribution. Moreover, the hollow MgFe-LDH microspheres exhibit excellent electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol in alkaline fuel cell, including high activity, long-term durability and cycling stability, owing to the significantly improved faradaic redox reaction and mass transport. Therefore, this work provides a promising approach for the design and synthesis of structure tunable materials with largely enhanced ethanol electrooxidation behavior, which can be potentially used in noble metal-free alkaline fuel cells.

        "abstract": "A valence force field named LDHFF was systematically developed for the layered double hydroxide (LDH) materials. Its potential function was referred from the polymer consistent force field (PCFF) by introducing a double-well potential to describe the oxygen-metal-oxygen (O-M-O) bending in the octahedral host sheets. The bonded (intramolecular) parameters, including the bond stretching constants, angle bending coefficients, as well as cross terms, were obtained from density function theory (DFT) calculations on the simplified but representative cluster models [M II 2M III(OH 2) 9(OH) 4] 3+ and [M III 3(OH 2) 9(OH) 4] 5+ (M II 2M III = Mg 2Al, Zn 2Al, Co 2Al, Ni 2Al, Cu 2Al, Mg 2Fe, Zn 2Fe, Ni 2Fe, Mg 2Cr, Zn 2Cr, Cu 2Cr, Co 2Cr; M III = Al, Fe, Cr). In the case of nonbonded potential, the van der Waals parameters were obtained by fitting them to the cluster models mentioned above. The partial charges used to calculate the Coulombic interactions were assigned as Mulliken charge from density functional theory (DFT) calculation. To validate these potential parameters, a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were subsequently employed for 24 LDH models, and the resulting structures, vibrational frequencies, as well as binding energies are in high accordance with the experimental findings. Using LDHFF, stable octahedral host structures were maintained over 2 ns in molecular dynamics simulations. These results demonstrate that LDHFF works effectively and accurately for MD studies of LDH materials, which provides a theoretical insight for understanding the structural property and exploiting the fabrication of functional LDH and related materials. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Ultra-small metal clusters with good activity and stability are of great significance for their practical applications in catalysis and materials science. Here we report a photohole-oxidation-assisted approach for anchoring ultra-small Ru clusters (\u223c1.5 nm) with an extremely high density (\u223c1017 m-2) onto TiO2 support. The resulting clusters have good thermal stability and exhibit excellent long-term catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methane (methanation). The anchoring process involves the oxidation of Ru3+ in solution by photogenerated holes on the TiO2 surface to give tiny RuO2 species (<0.8 nm) immobilized on the surface, followed by a H2 reduction step to produce Ru0 clusters. Aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (Cs-HRTEM) observations identify the Ru-Ru bond length contraction at the metal surface (relative to the interior of the particle) as well as bond length changes in the defect region at the metal-support interface. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further demonstrate that the ultra-small Ru clusters are well stabilized and tightly anchored onto the TiO2 substrate via Ru-O covalent bonding in the defect region of the metal-support interface. The high-dispersion of ultra-small Ru clusters as well as the strong chemical bonding at the interface account for their surprisingly high catalytic reactivity and excellent thermal/reaction stability. This synthetic method may open up a new way to fabricate thermally stable ultra-small metal clusters for practical industrial applications in catalysis. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "The ability to modulate and control the fluorescence properties of molecular solids at the micro/nanoscale is important to develop high-performance optoelectronic materials and sensors. Here we report the tunable one-photon and two-photon fluorescence as well as micro/nanostructures of dinitrostilbene- based (DNS) chromophore by the formation of layered multicomponent crystals with guanidinium cation (GD) through hydrogen-bonding assembly. The as-prepared GD2DNS bulk crystal shows a red-shift emission as well as enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime compared with those of the Na2DNS sample, which is related to the structural transfer of DNS from staggered arrangement to parallel fashion within the crystal. Periodic density functional theoretical calculations further show that the introduction of different cationic units can modify the frontier orbital distribution and electronic structure of DNS anions within the multicomponent crystals. Moreover, one-dimensional GD2DNS nanobelts with well-aligned orientation can be further obtained by a combined ultrasound and coprecipitation method. The GD2DNS nanobelts undergo a blue-shift fluorescence compared with its bulk crystal, and exhibit alternated photoresponse (such as emission wavelength and intensity) upon interaction with different nitroaromatic explosives (trinitrotoluene, picric acid and m-dinitrobenzen). Therefore, this work gives a facile bottom-up self-assembly rout to prepare organic multicomponent materials with tunable fluorescence properties and micro/nanostructures, which can be potentially used as luminescence detector for nitroaromatic explosives. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

        "title": "Calcined layered double hydroxides as a \u201cbiomolecular vessel\u201d for bromelain: Immobilization, storage and release",
        "abstract": "Calcined layered double hydroxide (LDO) has been used as the novel biomolecular vessel for the immobilization, storage as well as release of bromelain. The immobilization is attributed to physical adsorption without affecting the structure of LDO, and the optimum initial amount of bromelain was 20 ml of 4 mg/ml for 1 g LDO and the immobilized enzyme activity express was 33.4% at pH 6.5. The adsorption isotherm of bromelain/LDO can be well described with the Langmuir model with a R 2 of 0.9946, a maximum adsorption amount of 157 mg/g and the Langmuir adsorption equilibrium constant of 0.07 ml/mg. Significant improvements have been found in the stability of immobilized bromelain upon heat treatment (increase in residual activity and denaturation temperature) as well as storage time compared with those of free bromelain. In addition, the release maximum of bromelain reached to 70% and the residual activity maintained 81% in water solution at pH 7. Keywords Biomolecular vessel Bromelain Layered double oxides Layered double hydroxide Calcination 1 Introduction Enzymes are excellent catalysts with superb chemo-, regio-, stereo-, and chiral selectivities, but their use in chemical or industrial applications is severely limited for their insufficient availability, high price, sensitivity to pH/temperature, and their instability in organic solvents. Proteins/enzymes bound to solids, however, can overcome some of these problems. Among various solids used for enzyme binding, inorganic materials are extraordinarily interesting due to their hydrophilicity, thermal stability, chemical inertness, and their use as industrial catalysts or as catalyst support [1,2] . Layered inorganic solids such as LDHs (layered double hydroxides, which have the general formula [M 1\u2212 x 2+ M x 3+ (OH) 2 ] x + (X n \u2212 ) x / n \u00b7 m H 2 O, and consist of positively charged hydroxide sheets and interlayer guest anions and water molecules) [3] , have attracted much attention as the host for biomolecules binding among the inorganic materials, due to the reason that the layers of these solids can be expanded to accommodate biomolecules of different sizes. LDHs are chemically inert, thermally stable, and they can be prepared in a crystalline form in large quantities. A number of biomolecular have been intercalated into LDHs, such as l -phenylalanine [4] , deoxycholic acid [5] , pectin, xanthan gum, \u03ba-carrageenan, \u03b9-carrageean [6] and alginate [7] , DNA, mononucleotides, ATP, etc. [8] , to study the physi-chemical properties of the hybrid composites. However, it is generally difficult for the intercalation of larger enzymes/proteins within the sheets of LDHs, since this process will be kinetically limited by the slow diffusion of the biomolecular guests. Therefore, calcination products of LDHs, known as layered double oxides (LDO), have been paid more attention owing to their larger surface area and less diffusion resistance than those of LDHs. Moreover, LDO have the advantage of porous structure and both of abundant acid and basic sites [9,10] to bind with an enzyme. Ren et al. have investigated LDO as potential support for Penicillin G acylase (PGA), and the results showed that immobilization of the enzyme lead to the increase in its acid resistance [11] . Such improvements in the physical, chemical, and catalytic properties of bound enzymes are welcome changes for biocatalytic applications. Enzymes bound to solid surfaces are often less active than the corresponding enzymes in aqueous solutions, but improved stability of the bound enzyme can more than compensate for this loss [12] . The decrease in the activity of the bound enzymes is often attributed to the loss of enzyme structure, resulting from the unfavorable interactions between the enzyme and the surface functions of the solid matrix. Such enzyme-solid interactions also play a major role in the denaturation, stability, refolding, and degradation of the bound enzyme. Bromelain is a mixture of proteolytic enzymes that is derived from the stem of the pineapple plant, Ananas comosus . Others have previously shown that bromelain proteolytically removes certain cell surface molecules that affect lymphocyte migration and activation. In addition, bromelain treatment markedly affects the production of cytokines and inflammatory mediators by isolated leukocytes or colon epithelial cells in vitro [13] . These effects require that the bromelain be proteolytically active, therefore it is chosen as a representative example for current study. In this work, properties of bromelain upon immobilization, storage as well as release from LDO have been investigated to testify the possibility of LDO as a novel biomolecular vessel. Significant improvements have been found in the stability of immobilized bromelain upon heat treatment (increase in residual activity and denaturation temperatures) as well as storage time compared with those of free bromelain. In addition, the release behavior of the immobilized bromelain was studied in water solution, and the maximum release amount reached to about 70% and residual activity retained 81%. Therefore, LDO may have potential applications as the basis of a novel storage or delivery system for biomolecules or enzymes. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Bromelain (EC 3.4.22.32, formerly EC 3.4.22.4; from pineapple stem; 800 units per mg protein) was purchased from Sigma, and chemicals including Mg(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O, Al(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O, NaOH, NaNO 3 , CH 3 COOH, Casein, etc., were of analytical grade and purchased from the Beijing Chemical Plant Limited. 2.2 Preparation of LDO The precursor MgAl-NO 3 -LDH was synthesized by the hydrothermal method reported previously [14] . The pH value of solution (200 ml) containing 0.08 mol Mg(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O and 0.04 mol Al(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b79H 2 O was adjusted to 10.0 with NH 3 \u00b7H 2 O, and it was aged in an autoclave at 140 \u00b0C for 10 h. The precipitates were centrifuged, washed thoroughly with deionized and decarbon-dioxide water, and then dried at 60 \u00b0C for 24 h. Subsequently, LDO was obtained by calcination of MgAl-NO 3 -LDH at 500 \u00b0C for 5 h. 2.3 Immobilization of bromelain onto LDO The 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) with pH 5.8 was added to the suspension including 0.5 g LDO under N 2 atmosphere until the pH value reached to 6.5. Ten milliliters of 4 mg/ml bromelain solution was then added to the stirred suspension and maintained at room temperature for 24 h. The immobilized bromelain was obtained by centrifugation, washed and dried in vacuum at ambient temperature for 10 h. 2.4 Determination of bromelain content The amount of immobilized bromelain was determined from the concentration change of bromelain in solution before and after immobilization by measuring the absorbance photometrically at 275 nm. The immobilized bromelain was calculated by interpolation from a standard curve. 2.5 Measurement for the enzymatic activity The caseinolytic determinations were carried out essentially according to the method reported previously [15] , with minor modifications to solve the problem of the insolubility of LDO. The activities of free and immobilized bromelain were determined by the following way: 5 ml of enzyme solution containing 0.005 g of free bromelain or the immobilized bromelain was grinded for 10 min, and then it was added into a 5 ml of dilute solution of the enzyme which contained 2 mmol EDTA and 5 mm cysteine. After 10 min, 1 ml of above mixtures was hydrolyzed with 5.0 ml of 2.0 wt.% casein solution. The reaction mixture was maintained at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min, followed by termination with 5 ml of trichloroacetic acid solution containing 0.1 M trichloroacetic acid, 0.36 M sodium acetate and 0.32 M glacial acetic acid. The absorbance of the solution or the supernatant at 275 nm was plotted versus the enzyme weight to determine the enzymatic activity. The relative activity (RA) was defined as the ratio of the hydrolytic activity of the immobilized enzyme to that of the free enzyme, which was used to evaluate the activity of the immobilized bromelain. 2.6 Stability measurements for the immobilized and free bromelain The thermal stability of the immobilized bromelain was evaluated by measuring the residual activity (ZA) and denaturation of the enzyme. The solid enzymes exposed to various temperatures for 10 d were quickly cooled and assayed for their enzymatic activity at 37 \u00b0C immediately, and the denaturation exposed for 4 h was studied through monitoring the fluorescence spectrophotometer. The fluorescence spectra of bromelain (0.01 g) and bromelain/LDO (0.125 g) suspension in water were recorded at room temperature with 280 nm excitation. 338 nm emission is mostly due to the tryptophan residues present in the enzyme. The FT-IR absorbance at the amide I and II peak position of the enzyme samples was plotted as a function of temperature. The storage stability of the free and immobilized bromelain was evaluated by placing bromelain at 25 \u00b0C for various periods of time and by assaying for the activity. 2.7 Release of bromelain The release of bromelain was studied by putting the bromelain/LDO into the stirred pure water at pH 7.0, and the amount of bromelain released in solution at different time was determined with the method described in Section 2.4 . 2.8 Techniques of characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Rigaku XRD-6000 diffractometer, using Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 0.154 nm) at 40 kV, 30 mA, a scanning rate of 5\u00b0 min \u22121 , a step size of 0.02\u00b0 s \u22121 , and a 2 \u03b8 angle ranging from 3\u00b0 to 70\u00b0. The in situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded using a PERK 1 N ELMER spectrometer configured with a CKW-2 accessory and an automated temperature controller in the range of 4000\u2013400 cm \u22121 with 4 cm \u22121 resolution and heating rate of 5 \u00b0C min \u22121 . The standard KBr disk method (1 mg of sample in 100 mg of KBr) was used. The UV\u2013vis spectra were collected at 275 nm in a Shimadzu U-3000 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a RF-5301PC fluorophotometer in the range 300\u2013420 nm with the excitation wavelength of 280 nm and slit widths of 5 nm. The low-temperature N 2 adsorption experiments were carried out using a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 system. The samples were outgassed at 200 \u00b0C for 4 h. The specific surface area of the sample was calculated using the BET method based on the N 2 adsorption isotherm. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 The immobilization of bromelain onto LDO FT-IR spectra, in the 4000\u2013400 cm \u22121 wavenumber range at room temperature, of LDO, free bromelain and bromelain/LDO are shown in Fig. 1 . The spectrum of LDO ( Fig. 1 a) displays absorption bands at 3579 and 1645 cm \u22121 owing to the O\u2013H stretching and flexural oscillations of OH \u2212 group, respectively. The 1382 cm \u22121 band is assigned to absorption of NO 3 \u2212 group. Although heat treatment of LDH at 500 \u00b0C leads to its transformation to LDO, it still remains the basic layered structure. Based on the crystal structure of LDHs, each OH-group in the LDH layer is bonded to three metal cations [16] . Therefore, the superposition of bands belonging to 3Mg 2+ \u2013OH, 2Mg 2+ Al 3+ \u2013OH, Mg 2+ 2Al 3+ \u2013OH and 3Al 3+ \u2013OH resulted in the broad band at 3000\u20133750 cm \u22121 ( Fig. 1 a) [17] . For the free bromelain ( Fig. 1 b), the band around 3400 cm \u22121 is attributed to the N\u2013H stretching mode of the amidic binding of the enzyme, while the bands at 1650 and 1535 cm \u22121 arise from the C O stretching (amides I) and N\u2013H bending (amides II) vibrations, respectively. The band around 2934 cm \u22121 corresponds to the C\u2013H stretching of the CH 2 groups, and bands at 500\u2013700 cm \u22121 are assigned to absorption of deformation vibration belonging to amide in the area of crystallization. Compared with LDO, spectrum of bromelain/LDO ( Fig. 1 c) displays several new absorption peaks, such as the band around 2954 cm \u22121 due to the C\u2013H stretching of the CH 2 groups, 1533 cm \u22121 belonging to N\u2013H bending (amides II) vibrations, and 500\u2013700 cm \u22121 owing to absorption of deformation vibration of amide in the area of crystallization. Furthermore, there was a strong band at 1651 cm \u22121 resulting from the superposition of the absorption of LDO at 1645 cm \u22121 and of bromelain at 1650 cm \u22121 . The results above indicate the occurrence of the immobilization of bromelain onto LDO. No obvious shift in the bands corresponding to the C O stretching and N\u2013H bending vibrations of bromelain after immobilization can be observed (1650\u20131651 and 1535\u20131533 cm \u22121 ), implying a weak interaction between the bromelain and LDO. Moreover, compared with LDO, the spectrum of bromelain/LDO ( Fig. 1 c) showed a relatively narrow absorption peak at 3000\u20133700 cm \u22121 , and the O\u2013H stretching absorption of hydroxyl group shifted to low frequency from 3579 cm \u22121 of LDO ( Fig. 1 a) to 3438 cm \u22121 of bromelain/LDO ( Fig. 1 c). The immobilization of bromelain occurs through the formation of hydrogen bonding between \u2013OH groups on the surface of LDO and \u2013NH 2 of bromelain. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the precursor MgAl-NO 3 -LDH, LDO, bromelain/LDO, and LDO-PBS, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2 a, for the case of Mg/Al = 2, the LDH precursor displays the characteristic X-ray powder diffraction pattern of a layered hydrotalcite-like material. After calcinations at 500 \u00b0C, the layered structure disappeared and the XRD pattern ( Fig. 2 b) resembles that of poorly crystalline magnesium oxide as has been reported elsewhere [18] . When the LDO was dispersed in an aqueous solution containing PBS and bromelain under N 2 atmosphere for 24 h, the XRD pattern of bromelain/LDO ( Fig. 2 c) is rather similar to that of the pristine LDO except that the intensity of reflections both at 43.22\u00b0 and 62.58\u00b0 2 \u03b8 decreased and their half peak breadth widened attributed to the decrease in the crystallinity after the immobilization of bromelain onto the surface of LDO. In order to investigate the influence of PBS during the immobilization of bromelain, a comparison study was carried out by dispersing LDO in a PBS solution without bromelain under N 2 atmosphere. From Fig. 2 d, the characteristic pattern of MgAl-PO 4 -LDH [19] was observed. Therefore, the comparison between the XRD pattern of bromelain/LDO and that of the LDO-PBS indicates that the immobilization of bromelain on the surface of LDO prevents the regeneration of layered PO 4 -LDH structure under the experimental conditions. In order to find the optimal immobilization condition of bromelain on the surface of LDO, effects of both pH and initial amounts of bromelain on the activity of immobilized bromelain were examined. The effect of pH on the activity of immobilized bromelain was studied by adjusting the value of solution pH in the range 5.0\u20137.5 with PBS, taking into account the optimum pH range for free bromelain itself with maximum activity express in the reaction with casein substrates (6.0\u20137.0). As shown in Fig. 3 , the activity of immobilized bromelain has the highest value at pH 6.5, which accords well with the optimum pH of free bromelain. Thus, in all the following experiments, the pH value of reaction system was maintained at 6.5, unless otherwise mentioned. The relationship between the activity as well as the activity express of the immobilized enzyme and the initial amount of bromelain are shown in Fig. 4 . There was a tendency of the activity of immobilized bromelain coupling to increase with the initial amount of bromelain, however, the activity express of immobilized bromelain followed decrease due to possible effects of steric hindrance at higher immobilized densities. Similar conclusion has been reported by other researchers in the study of immobilization of \u03b2-fructofuranosidases on methacrylamide-based polymeric beads [20] . Based on the results above, the optimum amount of the initial enzyme was chosen as 10 ml of 4 mg/ml bromelain solution for 0.5 g dry LDO. In order to get further study of the immobilization of bromelain onto LDO, adsorption isotherm was conducted by filling with 4 mg/ml aqueous solution of bromelain ranging in volume from 0.0 to 20 ml into 0.5 g LDO solid in the system of immobilization of bromelain. The concentration of bromelain in the solutions, before and after adsorption experiments respectively, was determined by UV\u2013vis spectra at the wavelength of 275 nm. The amount of bromelain adsorbed by LDO was obtained from the difference between the initial ( C i ) and equilibrium concentrations ( C e ), per gram of LDO adsorbent: Q = ( C i \u2212 C e ) \u00d7 V / m . The adsorption isotherm was obtained by plotting the amount of bromelain adsorbed ( Q ) versus the adsorbate concentration ( C e ) in the equilibrium solution (as shown in Fig. 5 ). Three models, i.e., the Langmuir, the Freundilich, and the linear model were used to fit the experimental data, respectively. The experimental conditions, the estimated model parameters and regress coefficients ( R 2 ) are reported in Table 1 for all adsorption experimental runs. As can be seen from Table 1 , the regress coefficients ( R 2 ) for the Langmuir model (0.9946) are larger than that of Freundilich and the linear model, and the experimental q e values agree well with the calculated ones obtained from the Langmuir model. This indicates that the Langmuir model can be used to describe the adsorption of bromelain by LDO satisfactorily. The Langmuir adsorption equation is shown in Table 1 , where q m is the maximum amount of adsorbed bromelain per gram of adsorbent (mg/g) and K is the Langmuir adsorption equilibrium constant (ml/mg). From the results of fitting, the values of q m and K could be estimated as 157 mg/g and 0.07 ml/mg, respectively. 3.2 The storage properties of immobilized bromelain 3.2.1 Effect of temperature on thermal stability The thermal stability of immobilized enzymes is one of the most important criteria considered before their utilization in applications. The activity of immobilized enzymes is more resistant against heat treatment and denaturing agents than that of the soluble form. The effect of temperature on the stability of the immobilized bromelain on LDO was studied, and Fig. 6 illustrates the residual activity of both free and immobilized bromelain with casein hydrolysis at 37 \u00b0C after the preheat treatment for 10 days at different given temperatures. It can be seen that the immobilized bromelain is more stable than that of the free one in the higher temperature rang. For instance, immobilized enzyme retained 92% of its initial activity after heat treatment at 50 \u00b0C, while the corresponding free bromelain was 81%. This indicates that the immobilization of bromelain on LDO can improve its thermal stability remarkably and thus can be preserved at higher temperature. The FT-IR spectroscopy of enzymes provides direct method to monitor the temperature induced enzyme denaturation, for the amide I/amide II vibrational bands of the proteins/enzymes are sensitive to their structural changes [21] . Upon denaturation, the amide I and amide II bands shift to higher and lower frequency, respectively [22] , and the peak positions are estimated using the first or the second derivative method, as needed [23] . The in situ FT-IR spectra of both bromelain and bromelain/LDO at various temperatures are displayed in Fig. 7 (only a few spectra are shown for clarity). As can be observed from Fig. 7 A, the absorption bands at 1650 and 1535 cm \u22121 (at 30 \u00b0C) are characteristic of the amide I and amide II of free bromelain, respectively. With increasing the temperature to 80 \u00b0C, the amide I band moved to high frequency by 7 cm \u22121 (from 1650 to 1657 cm \u22121 ), and the amide II band shifted to low frequency by 2 cm \u22121 (from 1535 to 1533 cm \u22121 ). This indicates the occurrence of denaturation of free bromelain. However, no obvious shift in the amide bands of bromelain/LDO can be observed upon increasing the temperature from 30 to 100 \u00b0C. The FT-IR spectra indicate that the denatured temperature for the immobilized bromelain is much higher than that of the corresponding free bromelain. Moreover, the hydrogen bonding between bromelain and LDO might play an important role on the immobilization, for weak interaction may be more favorable to retain the native structure of enzyme [24] , while strong interactions between the enzyme and the matrix results in the distortion of the enzyme structure and thus the decrease in its stability [25] . The improvement in thermal stabilities for the immobilized bromelain was also verified by fluorescence studies. It is has been reported that excitation in the 280\u2013310 nm absorption bands of proteins usually results in fluorescence from the Trp residues in the 310\u2013390 nm region [26] . This is a convenient marker for protein, representing as large decreases or red shifts in fluorescence when denaturation of proteins occurs [27,28] . These changes are, most often, due to the exposure of the Trp residues that are buried in the protein, and they may also be due to the changes in the proximities of specific residues that may act as fluorescence quenchers [24] . The fluorescence emission spectra of free bromelain and bromelain/LDO recorded after heat treatment at various temperatures for 4 h are shown in Fig. 8 . The emission spectrum of free bromelain at 25 \u00b0C in water shows a maximum at 338 nm (280 nm excitation), which is indicative of the presence of tryptophan residues. Bromelain contains five tryptophan residues [29] and three of them may be buried in the hydrophobic core and other two may be located near the surface of the molecule [30] . The free bromelain denatured as the temperature increased to 70 \u00b0C, which was accompanied by the quenching of fluorescence at 338 nm, as well as the growth of a new peak at 387 nm ( Fig. 8 ). A similar thermal denaturation has been reported earlier for cyt c by Chaudhari [31] . The emission spectra of bromelain/LDO, in contrast, display a singe peak at 338 nm (280 nm excitation), and no significant changes in the position of the fluorescence maximum were observed on increasing the temperature from 25 to 100 \u00b0C. The decrease in the intensity of the band might be attributed to the presence of a non-native stable intermediate state similar to the molten globule formation, which has been reported previously for bromelain at low pH [30] . The improvement in the stability of immobilized bromelain testified by fluorescence spectroscopy is in accordance with the results obtained by in situ FT-IR presented above. 3.2.2 Effect of storage time on residual activity It was found in this study that no significant loss in the enzymic activity was observed for the solid and dry immobilized bromelain after storage in vacuum vessel at room temperature for as long as 3 months, whereas the corresponding free bromelain lost more than 60% of its initial activity under the same conditions. The higher storage stability of the immobilized bromelain can be attributed to the prevention of autodigestion and thermal denaturation as a result of the fixation of bromelain molecules on the surface of LDO. 3.3 The release of bromelain from LDO One of the most exploited properties of calcined LDHs is its \u201cmemory effect\u201d, i.e., it can reconstruct the original layered structure if being calcined at moderate temperatures (300\u2013500 \u00b0C), and then equilibrated with water vapor (forming meixnerite like materials, with interlayer hydroxyl anions), CO 2 (forming hydrotalcite-like materials), or immersed in a solution containing different anions. Generally, LDHs have greater affinities for multivalent anions than for monovalent anions. For example, CO 3 2\u2212 is preferentially adsorbed and not readily replaceable by other anions [32,33] . As a result, the release of bromelain from LDO was studied based on the \u201cmemory effect\u201d of LDO in this work. The release process was carried out in water solution without adding any other agent or under nitrogen atmosphere. Fig. 9 displays the XRD patterns of bromelain/LDO before and after the release reaction along with time. The characteristic pattern according to MgAl-CO 3 -LDH [34] was observed after 5 min release ( Fig. 9 b), including its (0 0 3), (0 0 6), (0 0 9), (1 0 1), (1 0 3), (1 0 6), (1 1 0) and (1 1 3) reflections, indicating the occurrence of the transformation from LDO to LDH. The XRD pattern after 10 min release ( Fig. 9 c) was rather similar to Fig. 9 b, while the intensity of the reflections after 15 min ( Fig. 9 d) decreased significantly and almost maintained unchanged along with the release time until to 30 min ( Fig. 9 g). The results indicate that the MgAl-CO 3 -LDH phase formed with higher crystallinity during the first 10 min release of bromelain from LDO, and after that the stacking sequence somewhat decreased. To demonstrate the practicability, the release amount of bromelain in water at pH 7.0 over a period of 35 min was investigated. Fig. 10 displays the release percentage of the immobilized bromelain along with time. The release percentage had a tendency coupling to increase with time during the first 20 min, while decreased at 25 min and retained unchanged. The maximum release amount reached to 70% and the residual activity retained as 81% at 20 min. As a result, the optimal release time should be chosen as 20 min. The release of bromelain from LDO was associated to two possible reasons: (1) the significant decrease in the specific surface area during the reconstruction of LDH by hydration of LDO (from 182 to 20 m 2 /g obtained by BET data), which has also been reported by other researchers [35] ; (2) the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged bromelain under the release condition and the host layer of LDHs. The unchanged release amount from 5 to 10 min ( Fig. 10 ) might be owing to the phase transformation from LDO to LDH which has been confirmed by XRD ( Fig. 9 b and c), while the decrease after 20 min might be due to the lower release rate of bromelain as a result of the better dispersion of LDHs particles along with release time, and the release equilibrium reached at 25 min. Therefore, this work provides a novel biomolecular vessel for prospective application on the storage or delivery system for bromelain. 4 Conclusions LDO has been demonstrated to be an effective support for the immobilization, storage and release of bromelain. The optimum initial amount of bromelain was 20 ml of 4 mg/ml for 1 g LDO and the immobilized enzyme activity express was 33.4% at pH 6.5. The immobilization is attributed to physical adsorption without affecting the structure of LDO and the adsorption isotherm of bromelain/LDO can be well described with the Langmuir model with a R 2 of 0.9946, a maximum adsorption amount of 156.92 mg/g and the Langmuir adsorption equilibrium constant of 0.07 ml/mg. Both thermal stability of the immobilized bromelain and its storage time were improved significantly compared with that of free bromelain. Furthermore, the release behavior of bromelain from LDO was investigated based on the \u201cmemory effect\u201d of LDHs. The release maximum of bromelain reached to 70% and the residual activity maintained 81%. Therefore, this work should be helpful for the development of LDO as the basis of a novel storage or delivery system for biomolecules or enzymes.

        "abstract": "A uniform and highly dispersed CuFe-based catalyst was obtained via a calcination-reduction process of a CuFeMg-layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursor, which exhibits good activity and selectivity towards catalytic conversion of syngas to mixed alcohols. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveal that the CuFeMg-LDH precursor possesses high crystallinity with a particle size of 40-60 nm. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) demonstrate a high dispersion of copper and iron species on the catalyst surface. The CuFe-based catalyst derived from CuFeMg-LDHs shows high CO conversion (56.89%) and the total alcohol yield (0.28 g mLcat. -1 h-1), as a result of the high dispersion of active species as well as the synergistic effect between the copper and the iron species revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) techniques. Therefore, this work provides a facile and effective method for the preparation of CuFe-based catalysts with high catalytic activity, which can be potentially used in syngas conversion to mixed alcohols. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "Cathode materials Li[CoxMn1-x]O2 for lithium secondary batteries have been prepared by a new route-precursor method of layered double hydroxides (LDHs). In situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis coupled with mass spectrometry (TG-MS) were used to monitor the structural transformation during the reaction of CoMn LDHs and LiOH\u00b7H2O: firstly the layered structure of LDHs transformed to an intermediate phase with spinel structure; then the distortion of the structure occurred with the intercalation of Li+ into the lattice, resulting in the formation of layered Li[CoxMn1-x]O2 with \u03b1-NaFeO2 structure. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data showed that the Co-O bonding length and the coordination number of Co were close to those of Mn in Li[CoxMn1-x]O2, which indicates that the local environments of the transitional metals are rather similar. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to measure the oxidation state of Co and Mn. The influences of Co/Mn ratio on both the structure and electrochemical property of Li[CoxMn1-x]O2 have been investigated by XRD and electrochemical tests. It has been found that the products synthesized by the precursor method demonstrated a rather stable cycling behavior, with a reversible capacity of 122.5 mAh g-1 for the layered material Li[Co0.80Mn0.20]O2. \u00a9 2007.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports a novel method to tune the fluorescence properties of fluorescein (FLU) in a 2D matrix of layered double hydroxide (LDH) by changing the interlayer microenvironment. FLU and surfactants with different alkyl chain lengths were cointercalated in the galleries of a Zn 2Al LDH by the anion exchange method. Thin films of FLU-C nH 2n+1SO 3/LDH (n = 5, 6, 7, 10, and 12, respectively; n stands for the number of carbon in the alkyl chain), which possess a well c-orientation revealed by XRD and SEM, were obtained by the solvent evaporation method on Si substrates. It was found that the orientation of FLU and its anisotropy, fluorescence wavelength, fluorescence quantum yield, and lifetime correlate with the microenvironment of the LDH gallery, which can be tuned by simply changing the alkyl chain length of the surfactant. The optimal fluorescence quantum yield, anisotropy, the longest fluorescence lifetime and the strongest photostability of the FLU-C nH 2n+1SO 3/LDH film can be obtained with n = 7, due to the \"size-matching\" rule between the organic dye and surfactant. \u00a9 2010 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Well-aligned hierarchical nanoarrays containing ZnO core and layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoplatelets shell have been synthesized via a facile electrosynthesis method. The resulting ZnO@CoNi-LDH core-shell nanoarray exhibits promising behavior in photoelectrochemical water splitting, giving rise to a largely enhanced photocurrent density as well as stability; much superior to those of ZnO-based photoelectrodes. This is attributed to the successful integration of photogenerated electron-hole separation originating from the ZnO core and the excellent electrocatalytic activity of LDH shell. This work provides a facile and cost-effective strategy for the fabrication of multifunctional nanoarrays with a hierarchical structure, which can be potentially used in energy storage and conversion devices. Hierarchical nanowire arrays based on a semiconductor core-layered double hydroxide shell are synthesized via a facile and cost-effective electrosynthesis method. The resulting core-shell ZnO@LDH NW array exhibits largely enhanced efficiency in photoelectrochemical watersplitting, including a large photocurrent and high stability, as a result of the significantly improved photogenerated carrier transfer and increased reaction kinetics of water splitting. ? 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

        "abstract": "The \"Hydrogen economy\" as an energy solution has received worldwide attention. Development of efficient, economic and recyclable catalysts for hydrogen generation from hydrogen storage materials (e.g., NH 3BH3, AB) under moderate conditions has been one of the most active research areas. In the well-studied transition metals, cobalt (Co) and copper (Cu) are very efficient catalysts towards NH3BH 3 dehydrogenation. In this work, we demonstrate the preparation of binary Cu-Co catalysts via the LDH precursor approach, which exhibit largely enhanced catalytic activity towards dehydrogenation of AB. The catalyst with a Cu/Co molar ratio of 1/1 yields a hydrolysis completion time less than 4.0 min at a rate of \u223c1000 mL (min-1 gcat) under the ambient conditions, comparable to the most reported noble metal catalysts (e.g., Ru, Pt). XRD, H2-TPR, XPS and HRTEM measurements verify that the synergistic effect between highly dispersive metallic Cu and Co 3O4 species plays a key role in the significantly enhanced activity of the Cu-Co catalyst. In addition, a monolithic Cu-Co film catalyst was fabricated by an in situ growth-reduction method, which displays further enhanced catalytic activity, recyclability and long-term reusability. This work provides an effective strategy for the fabrication of excellent Cu-Co catalysts for NH3BH3 decomposition, which can be used as promising candidates in pursuit of practical implementation of AB as a hydrogen storage material. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "A facile enzyme-free hydrogen peroxide electrochemical sensor was fabricated based on multilayer ultrathin film containing Naphthol green B anions (NGB) and exfoliated nanosheets of Co\u2013Al layered double hydroxide (LDH) via layer-by-layer self-assembly technique. The X-ray diffraction pattern indicates the superlattice structure of the film with repeating distance of 4.15 nm; SEM and AFM images show that the film surface is continuous and uniform. The electrochemical behavior of the ultrathin film was studied by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The ultrathin film modified electrode shows a fast direct electron transfer for the Co 2+ /Co 3+ redox couple with \u0394 E = 14 mV in 0.1 M NaOH solution. Furthermore, the modified electrode displays a significant electrocatalytic performance for H 2 O 2 with Michaelis\u2013Menten constant K M a p p = 169.3 \u2009 \u03bc M . The anodic peak current increased linearly with the concentration of H 2 O 2 from 8.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 to 1.8 \u00d7 10 \u22124 M with a low detection limit of 9.0 \u00d7 10 \u22127 M. The NGB/LDH ultrathin film was demonstrated as a feasible electrochemical sensor for detection of H 2 O 2 with rapid response, high stability, good reproducibility and excellent selectivity. Keywords Layered double hydroxide nanosheets Naphthol green B Layer-by-layer self-assembly Organic\u2013inorganic ultrathin film Enzyme-free sensor 1 Introduction Recently, electrochemical sensors have become one of the most promising analytical tools in medical science, pharmacology research and environmental detection due to their simplicity, high sensitivity and excellent selectivity [1\u20134] . Significant improvements continue to be made in methodologies and fabrication since the invention of electrochemical sensor. Considerable research interests have been focused on the subject of how to modify the electrodes for the purpose of obtaining electrochemical sensors with high stability, sensitivity and specificity [5\u20137] . Various methods including electrochemical deposition, screen-printing technique, sol\u2013gel technique and spin-coating approach, have been widely used and made great achievements in modifying electrodes [8\u201311] . More recently, the electrostatic layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly method has attracted much attention owing to the controllability of desirable thickness and architecture at a nanometer level. Some multilayer ultrathin films (UTFs) fabricated by LBL method have been extensively applied in electrochemical sensors [12\u201315] . Among them, the inorganic\u2013organic UTFs have become the intense research target attributed to their high stability, good biocompatibility and eminent conductivity [16\u201319] . Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), well-known as an important class of inorganic layered material, can be represented by the general formula [M 2+ 1\u2212 x M 3+ x (OH) 2 ] x + (A n \u2212 ) x / n \u00b7 m H 2 O, where M 2+ and M 3+ are divalent and trivalent metal ions respectively, and A n \u2212 is an exchangeable anion compensating for the positive charge of the hydroxide layers [20\u201323] . In recent years, LDHs, especially containing transition metals, have become the potentially attractive materials for electrode surface modifications due to the charge transport, redox catalysts, anion exchange and biocompatible properties [24\u201327] . However, further application was largely restricted because many macromolecules (enzymes and other electroactive molecules) cannot be intercalated into the LDH gallery but only absorbed onto the surface of LDH particles, resulting in low loading, serious aggregation as well as desorption. In addition, the generally used drop-casting method for the modification of electrodes leads to poor adhesion of LDH particles to the substrate. Recently, extensive efforts have been directed toward the delamination of LDH to obtain positively charged single nanosheets with ultimate 2D anisotropy [28\u201330] . One of the most important and attractive applications of such exfoliated nanosheets is that they serve as 2D building blocks to construct organic\u2013inorganic ultrathin films with superior functionalities to individual component [31,32] . This therefore inspires us to fabricate the electrochemical sensor by alternate LBL assembly of positively charged LDH nanosheets and negatively charged electroactive species. The resulting ultrathin film would exhibit the following advantages: firstly, the molecular level of assembly will result in a fast electron transfer between redox species and the underlying electrode owing to the high dispersion and uniform orientation of electroactive substance; secondly, the incorporation of LDH nanosheets can improve the adhesion of the ultrathin film to the electrode and thus facilitate the stability over a long period of usage. In this work, a novel enzyme-free electrochemical sensor was fabricated based on UTFs composed of Co\u2013Al LDH nanosheets and Naphthol green B (NGB, Fig. 1 ) via the electrostatic LBL assembly on the glass carbon electrode (GCE). Herein, Co\u2013Al LDH nanosheets worked as building blocks as well as electroactive substance and NGB, which was often used as a mediator in electrocatalysis [33,34] , served as negatively charged counterpart. The NGB/LDH UTF modified electrode was characterized by cyclic voltammetry and its electrocatalytic behavior for the oxidation of H 2 O 2 was thoroughly studied. We hope that the novel strategy in this work provides a feasible method for fabricating organic\u2013inorganic UTFs with superior electrochemical properties, for the purpose of potential applications in electroanalysis and electrochemical sensors. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and reagents Poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PSS, MW = 70,000), Naphthol green B (NGB) and an aqueous solution (20%) of poly(diallydimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA, MW: 100,000\u2013200,000) were purchased from Alfa Aesar Chemical Co. Ltd. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification. All the solutions were prepared by using water purified in a Milli-Q Millipore system (>18 M\u03a9 cm). 2.2 Fabrication of the multilayer UTFs The Co\u2013Al LDH nanosheets were prepared according to the reported method [28] . The detailed synthesis and characterization of Co\u2013Al LDH and Co\u2013Al LDH nanosheets were described in ESI ( Figs. S1 and S2 ). The (NGB/LDH) n UTFs were fabricated by applying the LBL assembly technique. Prior to assembly, the GCE (3 mm, diameter) was polished successively with 1.0, 0.3, and 0.05 \u03bcm alumina powder, and sonicated in 1:1 nitric acid/water, absolute ethanol and Milli-Q water for 1 min respectively. The cleaned GCE was firstly dipped into a PDDA solution (PDDA:H 2 O = 1:20, v/v) for 20 min and then washed thoroughly and dried with a N 2 flow. The fabrication of the (NGB/LDH) n multilayer films was carried out according to the following steps: the pretreated substrates were dipped alternately into the negatively charged NGB solution (1 mg mL \u22121 ) and the colloidal suspension of Co\u2013Al LDH nanosheets (1 mg mL \u22121 ), for 10 min each time. After each assembly step, the substrates were thoroughly rinsed with deionized water and dried with a N 2 flow. Subsequently, a series of deposition operations for NGB and LDH nanosheets were repeated n times to obtain (NGB/LDH) n UTFs ( Fig. 1 ). The fabrication process of the (NGB/LDH) n UTFs that deposited on quartz glass is similar to that described above. Quartz glass (3.0 cm \u00d7 1.0 cm) substrates were cleaned by immersing in a fresh piranha solution (H 2 SO 4 :H 2 O 2 (30%) = 3:1, v/v) ( warning : piranha solution is very corrosive and must be treated with extreme care) for 30 min, followed by rinsing in deionized water and drying with a N 2 flow. 2.3 Characterization and amperometric measurements X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded by a Rigaku XRD-6000 diffractometer, using Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 0.15418 nm) at 40 kV, 30 mA. The UV\u2013vis spectra were collected in a Shimadzu U-3000 spectrophotometer. The morphology of thin films was investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM Hitachi S-4700) with the accelerating voltage of 20 kV. The surface roughness was studied using the atomic force microscopy (AFM) software (Digital Instruments, Version 6.12). The electrochemical measurements were performed using a CHI 660C electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., China). A conventional three-electrode system was used, including a modified GCE as the working electrode, a platinum foil as the auxiliary electrode and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed on (NGB/LDH) n modified electrodes in 0.1 M NaOH with 5 mM Fe(CN) 6 3\u2212/4\u2212 solution at a potential of +0.22 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The EIS dispersions were recorded in the frequency range 0.01\u2013100 kHz. The solutions were purged with highly purified nitrogen for 20 min prior to measurement. All measurements were performed at room temperature. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural and morphological characterization of the (NGB/LDH) n UTFs The multilayer film buildup process was monitored with a UV\u2013vis spectrometer after each deposition of NGB as depicted in Fig. 2 A . The strong absorption bands at 239 and 292 nm are due to the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0* transition in the naphthoquinone structure of NGB. Compared with the pristine NGB in aqueous solution ( Fig. 2 A inset a, 235 and 283 nm), a little red-shift for the multilayer film can be attributed to interactions between individual molecules in the densely packed films. The intensities of the absorption bands at 239 and 292 nm correlate linearly with the bilayers number ( Fig. 2 A inset b), indicating a stepwise and uniform film growth procedure. XRD patterns ( Fig. 2 B) of the multilayer films illustrate the evolution of a Bragg peak at 2 \u03b8 = 2.1\u00b0 ( d 0 0 1 = 4.1 nm), which can be attributed to a so-called superlattice reflection of the organic\u2013inorganic periodic nanostructure [30] . Furthermore, the reflection intensity increased progressively with the increase of bilayers number, further confirming the successful fabrication of the (NGB/LDH) n UTFs. Further surface morphology and architecture of the (NGB/LDH) n UTFs were investigated by SEM and AFM. The top view of SEM images for the (NGB/LDH) n UTFs showed that both the homogeneity and surface coverage of the UTFs increased with the increase of bilayer number ( Fig. 3 A ). AFM topographical images (3 \u03bcm \u00d7 3 \u03bcm) of the (NGB/LDH) n UTFs are shown in Fig. 3 B. The value of root-mean-square (rms) roughness for the UTFs increased slowly from 2.87 nm (5 bilayers) to 6.98 nm (20 bilayers), indicating relatively smooth surface of the UTFs. Moreover, a linear correlation between the film thickness and bilayer number was observed from their side view SEM images ( Fig. S3 ), confirming that the UTFs possess a uniform and periodic layered structure. The thickness of one bilayer was calculated to be \u223c3.9 nm from the linear slope, in approximate agreement with the periodicity result obtained from XRD measurement (4.1 nm). 3.2 Direct electrochemistry of the UTFs modified electrode Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) in 0.1 M NaOH solution of the bare electrode, the (NGB/PDDA) 6 UTF modified and the (NGB/LDH) 6 UTF modified electrode are displayed in Fig. 4 A . No redox peaks were observed both for the bare electrode and the (NGB/PDDA) 6 UTF modified electrode (curve a and b respectively). However, the (NGB/LDH) 6 UTF modified electrode gives a couple of well-defined reversible redox peaks at 0.496 and 0.482 V respectively (curve c). These observations clearly demonstrate that this pair of peaks belongs to the redox reaction of Co\u2013Al LDH nanosheets. Moreover, a rather low \u0394 E p (14 mV) was obtained for the (NGB/LDH) 6 modified electrode, and the ratio between the anodic and cathodic peak current was \u223c1.2. Compared with the (NGB/LDH) 6 modified electrode, the (PSS/LDH) 6 modified electrode gave a couple of not well-resolved redox peaks at 0.536 and 0.434 V under the same conditions with \u0394 E p = 92 mV ( Fig. S4 ), indicating that NGB serves as a kind of conductive substance facilitating charge transfer. Furthermore, the CVs of (NGB/LDH) n modified electrodes with different bilayer numbers are shown in Fig. 4 B, from which the peak current (both anodic and cathodic) exhibits linear augment along with the bilayer number ( n ), suggesting the uniform growth of the (NGB/LDH) n UTFs. In addition, Fig. S5 shows CVs of the (NGB/LDH) 6 modified electrode performed at different pH values. As the pH value increases, the peak potential shifts to negative direction with a slope of \u221270.2 mV pH \u22121 , indicating a transfer of two-proton (OH \u2212 ) process in the pH range 12\u201313. Similar result has also been reported by Tian et al. [35] and the peak current increases simultaneously, suggesting that OH \u2212 plays a key role in the redox process of cobalt. According to the previous reports on the redox reaction of Co 2+ /Co 3+ in Co\u2013Al LDH in 0.1 M NaOH solution [25,36] , the redox reaction in this system can be described as Eq. (1) : (1) Co(OH) 2 \u2013LDH + OH \u2212 \u2194 CoOOH\u2013LDH + H 2 O + e \u2212 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is an effective method for probing the features of surface-modified electrodes and has been successfully used to characterize the formation of multiplayer films on different substrates [37,38] . The EIS consists of two sections: one is the linear part at lower frequencies representing the diffusion-limited process; the other one is a semicircle portion observed at higher frequencies corresponding to the electron-transfer-limited process. The Nyquist plots of the bare electrode and the (NGB/LDH) n UTF modified electrodes with different bilayers are shown in Fig. 5 . The bare electrode exhibits a straight line, which is a characteristic of diffusion limited electrochemical process. In contrast, a semicircle part of the impedance spectrum can be observed for the (NGB/LDH) n UTF modified electrode and the diameters of the semicircle increased with the increase of bilayer number, indicating the augment of electron-transfer resistance along with the deposition procedure. The results above confirm a successful LBL growth of the (NGB/LDH) n UTF on the surface of GCE. The effect of scan rate on the electrochemical response of the modified electrode is displayed in Fig. 6 A . The redox peak current increased linearly with the increase of the scan rate from 0.02 to 0.14 V s \u22121 , indicating that the redox reaction is a surface-controlled electrochemical process. Furthermore, according to the Laviron theory [39,40] , the electron transfer coefficient ( \u03b1 ) and the electron transfer rate constant ( k s ) for the (NGB/LDH) n modified electrode and (PSS/LDH) n modified electrode were calculated by the following equations: (2) E p a = E \u03b8 \u2032 + 2.303 R T ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 ) n F log \u2009 \u03bd (3) E p c = E \u03b8 \u2032 \u2212 2.303 R T \u03b1 n F log \u2009 \u03bd (4) log \u2009 k s = \u03b1 \u2009 log ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 ) + ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 ) log \u2009 \u03b1 \u2212 log R T n F \u03bd \u2212 n F \u0394 E p \u03b1 ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 ) 2.303 R T where \u03b1 is the charge transfer coefficient; k s is the electron transfer rate constant; \u03bd is the scan rate; n is number of transferred electron; R is the gas constant; F is the Faraday constant; T is the absolute temperature; E \u03b8 \u2032 is the apparent formal potential. Based on the linear relationship between E p and log \u03bd ( Fig. S6 ) and Eq. (4) , it was calculated that \u03b1 = 0.48 and k s = 1.4 s \u22121 for the (NGB/LDH) n UTF modified electrode; \u03b1 = 0.59 and k s = 0.9 s \u22121 for the (PSS/LDH) n UTF modified electrode. The results demonstrate that NGB accelerates the direct electron transfer between LDH nanosheets and the GCE than PSS. Moreover, the peak potentials of the (NGB/LDH) n UTF modified electrode were nearly independent on the scan rate in the range 0.02\u20130.14 V s \u22121 , also demonstrating the NGB accelerated the electron transfer between Co\u2013Al LDH nanosheets and the GCE. Furthermore, the stability of the UTFs was evaluated by consecutive voltammetric sweep method. After 40 consecutive cycles scanning, the relative standard deviation (RSD) was 0.8% for the anodic current and 0.6% for the cathodic current ( Fig. 6 B), indicating excellent stability of the (NGB/LDH) 6 UTF modified electrode. 3.3 Electrocatalytic behavior of the (NGB/LDH) 6 UTF modified electrode for H 2 O 2 The electrocatalytic behavior of the (NGB/LDH) n modified electrode towards the electrochemical oxidation of H 2 O 2 was investigated by CVs. Fig. S7 shows the response current of different bilayers in the same concentration of H 2 O 2 , from which the maximum current response for H 2 O 2 was obtained at the (NGB/LDH) 6 modified electrode. Therefore, the (NGB/LDH) 6 UTF modified electrode was chosen as the working electrode in this work. Fig. 7 A shows the CVs of the (NGB/LDH) 6 modified electrode in the absence and presence of H 2 O 2 . A remarkable increase in anodic peak current was observed after the addition of 0.1 mM H 2 O 2 , with a negative shift for the anodic peak from 0.496 V to 0.394 V. In contrast, no obvious current response was obtained for the bare electrode and the (NGB/PDDA) 6 modified electrode under the same conditions ( Fig. 7 B). The results elucidate that the (NGB/LDH) 6 UTF modified electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity to H 2 O 2 and H 2 O 2 participates and accelerates the redox reaction of Co\u2013Al LDH on the surface of GCE. Based on the previous reports [25,27] and the results above, it is proposed that the electrochemical reaction process can be described as the following equations: (1) Co(OH) 2 \u2013LDH + OH \u2212 \u2194 CoOOH\u2013LDH + H 2 O + e \u2212 (5) CoOOH\u2013LDH + H 2 O 2 + OH \u2212 \u2192 CoO 2 + 2H 2 O + 1/2O 2 + e \u2212 (6) CoO 2 + H 2 O + e \u2212 \u2192 CoOOH\u2013LDH + OH \u2212 The amperometric response of the (NGB/LDH) 6 modified electrode to H 2 O 2 was examined by successively increasing the concentration of H 2 O 2 at the constant potential of 0.38 V ( Fig. 8 A ). A linear relationship between anodic current and the concentration of H 2 O 2 was observed with the coefficient of 0.9991 when the concentration of H 2 O 2 ranges from 8 \u00d7 10 \u22126 to 1.8 \u00d7 10 \u22124 M ( Fig. 8 A inset). The detection limit is estimated to be as low as 0.9 \u03bcM (signal over noise S / N = 3). The required time to reach 95% steady-state response was 2.7 s, indicating a fast diffusion of H 2 O 2 through the UTFs. In addition, the electrocatalytic activity of the (PSS/LDH) 6 modified electrode was also investigated ( Fig. S8A ), and the result shows that the response current is much weaker than that of the (NGB/LDH) 6 modified electrode with the same H 2 O 2 concentration. This indicates that the electrocatalytic activity of the (NGB/LDH) 6 electrode is much higher than that of the (PSS/LDH) 6 electrode. Moreover, the response time for the (NGB/LDH) 6 electrode (2.7 s) is shorter than that of the (PSS/LDH) 6 electrode (5.8 s). Furthermore, it is well known that a smaller Michaelis\u2013Menten constant ( K M a p p ) implies a higher catalytic activity of the immobilized electrocatalyst [41,42] . Herein, a stimulant constant was used to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of the UTF for H 2 O 2 . The apparent K M a p p can be calculated from the electrochemical version of Lineweaver\u2013Burk equation: (7) 1 I s s = 1 I max + K M a p p I max C I ss is the steady-state current after the addition of substrate; I max is the maximum current measured under saturated substrate condition; C is the bulk concentration of the substrate. Based on the slope and intercept of the linear correlation between the reciprocals of I ss and C ( Fig. 8 B, Fig. S8B ), the apparent K M a p p was calculated to be 169.3 and 202.6 \u03bcM for the (NGB/LDH) 6 electrode and (PSS/LDH) 6 electrode respectively, indicating that the former electrode exhibits a higher electrocatalytic activity for H 2 O 2 than the latter electrode. Selectivity plays a vital role in practical use for sensors due to the objective always mixed with various interfering substrates. In order to study the selectivity of the (NGB/LDH) 6 modified electrode, the interference effect of uric acid, ascorbic acid, glucose and dopamine was examined respectively during amperometric response for H 2 O 2 (shown in Fig. 9 ). A sharp increase in current was obtained with the addition of 0.04 mM H 2 O 2 ; on the contrary, no obvious current response was observed with the addition of either of the interference compounds mentioned above, although the concentration is 10 times higher than that of H 2 O 2 . In addition, the stability and reproducibility of the sensor were also evaluated. Eight replicate measurements of one electrode over 0.04 mM H 2 O 2 show a RSD of 0.9%. The long-term stability was investigated by measuring the current response of 0.04 mM H 2 O 2 every day over 14 days. After two weeks, the current maintained 92% of its initial response. Furthermore, the reproducibility was evaluated by using five sensors fabricated independently, indicating an acceptable reproducibility with RSD of 1.9% for determining the same concentration of H 2 O 2 . The results above demonstrate that the (NGB/LDH) 6 UTF modified electrode has potential application in the determination of H 2 O 2 . 4 Conclusions In summary, organic\u2013inorganic UTFs involving two different electroactive species, NGB and Co\u2013Al LDH nanosheets, were successfully fabricated by LBL technique. The structural and surface morphology studies show that the ultrathin film is continuous and uniform, with long range stacking order resulted from a superlattice nanostructure. The (NGB/LDH) 6 UTF modified electrode demonstrates a couple of well-defined reversible redox peaks attributed to the electron transfer between Co\u2013Al LDH nanosheets and GCE. Furthermore, the UTF modified electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity toward H 2 O 2 with a linear response as the concentration of H 2 O 2 ranges from 8 \u00d7 10 \u22126 to 1.8 \u00d7 10 \u22124 M. Furthermore, the long-term stability and the excellent anti-interference performance of the sensor indicate that the (NGB/LDH) n UTFs will be a promising material for electrochemical sensor application. Therefore, this work provides a facile strategy to fabricate enzyme-free H 2 O 2 sensor based on organic\u2013inorganic LBL self-assembly film. It is anticipated that the method in this work can be used for the design and fabrication of various nano-scale electronic devices or sensors.

        "title": "Theoretical study of the hexahydrated metal cations for the understanding of their template effects in the construction of layered double hydroxides",
        "abstract": "A series of octahedral hexahydrated metal cations as model formula [M(OH 2 ) 6 ] n + (M = metal cation, n = 2, 3 and 1 for M = Li) have been investigated by density functional theory (DFT) to shed light on their template effects in the construction for layered double hydroxides (LDHs) layers. The metal cations were classified to three types according to their calculated structural distortion angle \u03b8 as follows: Type I (canonical structure, \u03b8 : 0\u20131\u00b0), Type II (slightly distorted structure, \u03b8 : 1\u201310\u00b0) and Type III (heavily distorted structure, \u03b8 : >10\u00b0), respectively. The structure and properties of the hydrated cations such as bond distance, O\u2013M\u2013O bond angle distortion, binding energy, the valence electronic configuration, ligand field and Jahn\u2013Teller effect and natural bond orbital (NBO), which are related to the construction of LDHs layers, were systematically investigated. It was found that in the case that the introduced cations which have close ionic radii to that of Mg 2+ , the distortion angles of their octahedral hexahydrated metal cations (which are governed by the coordination environment of the metal ion) play more significant role of structure directing for the LDHs layers than the ion size. These cations can be introduced into LDHs layers with the availability in the following order: Type I > Type II > Type III. The coordination preference of the cations with much larger size in the formation of LDHs are also been discussed. The calculation-based rule is in good agreement with the experimental results. Keywords Hexahydrated metal ions Layered double hydroxides Template effect Density functional calculation Natural bond orbital Structural direction 1 Introduction Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), also known as hydrotalcite-like materials and anionic clays, are available both as naturally occurring minerals and synthetic materials [1] . LDHs have brucite-like (Mg(OH) 2 ) intercalated structure and isomorphous replacement of trivalent cations for a fraction of divalent cations leads to the positively charged host layers, in which each metal cations M 2+ or M 3+ is coordinated by six oxygen atoms, forming the M 2+ /M 3+ (OH) 6 octahedron. These octahedra constitute the two-dimensional sheets via edge sharing, which then stack together by hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups of adjacent sheets, balanced by a wide range of interlayer anions A n \u2212 [2\u20134] ( Fig. 1 g), forming various kinds of LDHs materials represented by [M 2+ 1\u2212 x M 3+ x (OH) 2 ] x + (A n \u2212 x / n )\u00b7 m H 2 O [2] . These layered solid materials have received considerable attention due to their potential applications in the fields of catalysis [1a] , gene and molecular reservoir [1b] , optical materials [1c] , functional hybrid nanostructured materials [1d] , controlled drug-release system [1e] and thin films [1f\u2013h] . The above formula indicates that the value of the stoichiometric coefficient ( x ), the identities of the interlayer anions (A n \u2212 ) and the intra-layer cations can be varied over a wide range, which makes it possible to produce tailor-made materials for specific requirements. In recent years, many novel ternary and even quaternary LDHs have been synthesized [5] . In fact, the range of LDHs materials is even larger than suggested by the formula mentioned above because materials containing monovalent lithium ions of the type [LiAl 2 (OH) 6 ] + [A n \u2212 ] 1/ n \u00b7 y H 2 O are also known and have similar structure [6] . Based on the previous abundant experimental work, an empirical rule for the LDHs synthesis has been drawn, i.e., a metal cation, which is incorporated into LDHs layers, should have an ionic radius not too different from that of Mg 2+ (0.72 \u00c5) [2] . Although it is very helpful for the LDHs construction, there are still some exceptions. For instance, according to this rule, many researchers attempted to introduce Pd 2+ and Pt 2+ with close ionic radii (0.86 and 0.80 \u00c5, respectively) [7] to that of Mg 2+ into LDHs layers due to their great potential application in catalysis. However, it has been reported that only trace of them can be introduced (0.04\u20135.0% atomic ratio percent) [8] . On the other hand, Ca 2+ and Cd 2+ , with much larger ionic radius (1.00 and 0.95 \u00c5, respectively) than that of Mg 2+ , have been reported to be incorporated into LDHs layers with a relatively large amount to form stable structure [9,10] . These results indicate that the ion size is not the only crucial factor that influences the construction of LDHs, as a result, it is necessary to find another criteria that can work together with the ion size rule and then give more clear instruction for the design and preparation of LDHs materials. It is well known that the method of coprecipitation is the most commonly used preparative technique for LDHs [3,4] . Recently, there has been an increasing interest in applications of LDH thin films to functional materials [1f\u2013h] . Template-directed synthesis has been one of the most promising methods in the synthesis of inorganic films [11] . This method uses a floating monolayer as a template for the growth of a layered inorganic compound from an aqueous solution. Some efforts have been focused on clarifying such an effect from the viewpoint of structural consistency between a template and a growing crystal plane [12,13] . Herein, we attempt to extend this method to the formation of LDHs layer by theoretical study. Recently, the use of computational methods for the study of LDHs has become an essential adjunct to experimental techniques for the analysis of the microstructure. Force-field based simulations (molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo methods) form the bulk of the literature on the modeling of LDHs systems to study the swelling properties, the arrangement of interlayer anions, the reactivity and other properties [1e,14] . However, such methods are unable to investigate the electronic structure inside LDHs layers, which is very important for the stability of the LDHs. Hence, quantum chemical calculations have been alternatively carried out. In general, for previous electronic structure studies of LDHs materials, two main models have been considered [15] : a semi-infinite model and a cluster model. The first one focuses on properties related with the whole bulk of the LDHs crystal in its whole extension by periodicity mainly with ab initio plane-wave density functional theory (PW-DFT) [16] or linear-combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) methods [17] . The second one is used to cut a small piece of the solid (a cluster) including the main information for studying the property of LDHs. Semiempirical molecular orbital method was employed [18a,b] to predict the geometry of layer structure, and the structural and chemical properties of the layers were also investigated by the density functional theory (DFT) [18c,d] , claiming good agreement with experimental work. These studies show that the use of molecular cluster models is a valid approach for qualitative description of properties of LDHs layers. However, the cluster model were usually limited to a reasonable size that contains one or two kinds of cations in these studies (mostly Mg 2+ and Al 3+ ) due to the demand for the computational cost. In the present work, in order to study which cations can be introduced into the layers stably, we take a different insight into the formation of LDHs layer from the viewpoint of template effect. Since a LDH layer consists of edge-sharing octahedra of a mixture of di- and trivalent metal ions, it is reasonable for us to determine the most probable hexahydrated monomer of the metal ions [M(OH 2 ) 6 ] n + (M = metal cation) as the initial template to perform the density functional theoretic computation. By this way, we attempt to understand the template effect of the hexahydrated metal ions in the formation of the LDHs layer. Similar theoretical studies have been reported in the cases of Mg 2+ in brucite [18c] and Al 3+ in zeolite [19] . In this work, more di- and tri- valent hexahydrated metal ions which have been reported to be related to the LDHs layers ( Table S3, Supplementary Information ) are analyzed besides the most common hydrated Mg 2+ and Al 3+ ones. Moreover, the hydrated monovalent lithium ion is also investigated for the understanding of the formation of Li-Al-LDH. According to the well-known crystal field theory and Jahn\u2013Teller theorem, it can be expected that besides the ion size, the effects of the constrained environment of cations would also affect the relative stability of the octahedral hexahydrated metal ions. For instance, Cu 2+ shows the Jahn\u2013Teller effect significantly in the six-coordination environment, and for Pd 2+ and Pt 2+ , they prefer to be fourfold coordinated to form square-planar geometry. Although some studies have been focused on the coordination properties of metal cations sixfold coordinated to water [20] , the template effect on the formation of LDHs layers are still unclear. Therefore, herein the characteristic coordination parameters (such as bond distance, bond angle and binding energy) of the octahedral hexahydrated metal ions are systematically discussed, and the valence electronic configuration of metal ions, Jahn\u2013Teller effects and natural bond orbitals (NBO) which influence on the structure of octahedral hexahydrated metal ions have also been illustrated, so as to find out some rational rules other than the empirical ion size one for the preparation of prospective LDH compounds or related materials. The results provide important insight into formation of the main hydroxide layer, and quantitatively reveal that the distortion angle of the octahedral hexahydrated metal ions could be used as a more effective criterion for the construction of LDHs layers when an introduced cation has a close ionic radius to that of Mg 2+ . It was found that the theoretical results are in high accordance with the experimental findings. 2 Computational method 2.1 Model of the octahedral hexahydrated metal ions as an initial template in the formation of LDHs layer Since the metal\u2013oxygen sixfold coordination octahedra are edge-shared in the LDHs layers, the edge length is an important factor for the formation of the LDHs layers. Consequently, in the formation of a layer, the O\u22efO edge length of the initial template, octahedral metal ions, becomes an important factor for the formation of LDHs materials. It is evident that the metal ion included octahedron with closer O\u22efO edge length to that of Mg 2+ octahedron can combine with each other to form a layer more easily. As can be seen from Fig. 1 a and b, the O\u22efO edge length of octahedral metal ions is determined by both the M\u2013O bond length and O\u2013M\u2013O angle, which actually indicates the two important factors related to the formation of LDHs layers. The former derives from the electrostatic interaction between metal ion and oxygen atom while the latter correlates to the coordination environment of the metal ion. However, the empirical criterion associated with the ionic size, which has been generally adopted in the LDHs construction, is only focused on the former factor. In contrast, the latter factor has received little attention before, although geometrically, the latter factor plays a more important role than the former due to the more significant contribution to the distortion of O\u22efO edge length by the O\u2013M\u2013O angle than the M\u2013O bond length. This is actually also the reason for the failure in explaining several LDHs formation ( vide supra ) on the basis of the empirical criterion. In this work, theoretical methods were used to understand the influence of O\u2013M\u2013O angle of the octahedral metal ions on the construction of the octahedral LDHs sheets. The model of the hexahydrated octahedral metal ion is shown in Fig. 1 a with initial T h symmetry [20] . To test the dependence of the template effect of the hexahydrated octahedral metal ions in the formation of LDHs layer, repeating calculations are extended to a system cluster contain a larger number of atoms modeled as formula [Mg n (OH 2 ) n +6 (OH) 2 n \u22122 ] 2+ ( n = 2\u20137) consisting of 2\u20137 Mg atoms, since it includes only one kind of metal ion (Mg 2+ ), which greatly simplifies the identification of the crystal structure compared with other LDHs. In these models, each Mg\u2013O\u2013Mg bridging oxygen atom is set to be bonded to one hydrogen atom, and the terminal oxygen atoms are set to be bonded to two hydrogen atoms, in avoidance of the appearance of the unpaired electrons in the truncated ligands. Fig. 1 b\u2013e displays the top views of [Mg n (OH 2 ) n +6 (OH) 2 n \u22122 ] 2+ ( n = 2, 3, 5, 7) clusters. The calculation results will be discussed in Section 3.1 . 2.2 Density functional calculations Theoretical calculations were carried out on the series of [M(OH 2 ) 6 ] n + (M = metal cation, n = 2, 3 and 1 for M = Li) cluster, where M is metal cation with di- and trivalence ( Fig. 1 a). For the transition periods, the ions are calculated only in high-spin state. Moreover, for some d 5 or d 6 ions such as Mn 2+ , Ru 3+ , Os 3+ , Co 3+ , Rh 3+ and Ir 3+ , which in most cases form low-spin ground-state complexes due to the larger ligand field stabilization energy (LFSE) in low-spin state configuration than in high-spin one [21] , have also been calculated in low-spin state. At the same time, the models of [Li(OH 2 ) x ] + ( x = 2, 3, 4) have been calculated for the comparison with their sixfold coordination complex. The model geometrical optimization was performed by the density functional theory (DFT) with the three-parameter hybrid functional (B3LYP) [22] . The effective core potential (ECP), LANL2DZ [23] , and the full electron basis sets, 6-31G(d) [24] , were employed to the metal ions and OH 2 ligands, respectively. In addition, Mg, Ca, Al, Ga and Li have been treated with 6-31G(d) basis sets and CEP-121G basis set [25] were used for indium in order to test the performance of LANL2DZ basis sets. It was found that these two kinds of basis sets give comparable optimized geometries of [M(OH 2 ) 6 ] n + (M = Mg, Ca, Al, Ga and Li), as shown in Table 2 . The calculations were performed with the Gaussian 03 program suite [26] . No constraints were imposed on the geometry in any of the computations. The attainment of the energy minimum of each structure in full geometry optimization was tested by frequency calculations. The reported energies in this work were corrected by zero-point energy (ZPE). 2.3 Natural bond orbital analysis Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis has been demonstrated as a useful tool to provide chemists with a quantitative description of interatomic and intermolecular interactions in accordance with the classical Lewis structure concepts and with the basic Pauling\u2013Slater\u2013Coulson pictures of bond hybridization and polarization [27] . In the present work, we use NBO analysis to describe the bonding interaction between the metal ions and OH 2 ligands in the [M(OH 2 ) 6 ] n + model. The natural localized molecular orbitals/natural population analysis (NLMO/NPA) was also performed to illustrate the formation of the bond between them. We select different divalent cations which have been reported to be related to the LDHs layers and the trivalent cation Al 3+ and Ga 3+ which are the most commonly trivalent component in LDHs layers to perform the NBO calculations in high-spin state. NBO analysis is carried out at the UB3LYP/LANL2DZ/6-31G(d) level using the NBO 5.0 program and built-in NBO 3.1 [28] subroutines of the Gaussian 03 program. The program NBOView 1.1 [29] is used for visualization of pre-NBO orbitals. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 The reliability to choose the model of the octahedral hexahydrated metal ions as an initial template in the formation of LDHs layer A cluster model, [Mg n (OH 2 ) n +6 (OH) 2 n \u22122 ] 2+ ( n = 2\u20137), is calculated for testify the reliability of our model for the octahedral hexahydrated metal ions [M(OH 2 ) 6 ] n + as an initial template in the formation of LDHs layer ( Fig. 1 ). Suppose the formation of the cluster follows as the reaction as 2 [ Mg ( OH 2 ) 6 ] 2 + + 2 OH - \u2192 [ Mg 2 ( OH 2 ) 8 ( OH 2 ) ] 2 + + 4 H 2 O [ Mg n - 1 ( OH 2 ) n + 5 ( OH ) 2 n - 4 ] 2 + + [ Mg ( OH 2 ) 6 ] 2 + + 2 OH - \u2192 [ Mg n ( OH 2 ) n + 6 ( OH ) 2 n - 2 ] 2 + + 5 H 2 O ( n = 3 \u2013 7 ) Table 1 summarizes binding energies and the optimized geometries of [Mg n (OH 2 ) n +6 (OH) 2 n \u22122 ] 2+ ( n = 2\u20137) clusters. The binding energy is defined as: (1) \u0394 E bind = nE Mg 2 + + ( n + 6 ) E H 2 O + ( 2 n - 2 ) E OH - - E [Mg n (OH 2 ) n + 6 (OH) 2 n - 2 ] 2 + ( n = 2 \u2013 7 ) where \u0394 E bind denotes the total binding energy, which indicate the relative stability of the system, E Mg 2+ denotes the calculated energy of the ground-state Mg 2 + , E H 2 O = \u221276.4090 a.u., E H 2 O ( ZPE ) = \u221276.3878 a.u., E OH - = \u221275.1224 a.u. computed with 6-31G(d) basis set (1 a.u. = 627.51 kcal mol \u22121 ), and E [ Mg n (OH 2 ) n + 6 (OH) 2 n - 2 ] 2 + denotes the total energy of the cluster, respectively. The binding energies listed in Table 1 were corrected by zero-point energy (the detailed results of each term in Eq. (1) are given in Supplementary Information Table S1 ). Fig. 2 a shows the dependence of the binding energy of a cluster on the size of a cluster. As is shown, the binding energy increases in proportion to the number of Mg atoms. It is, thus, expected that the larger the number of Mg atoms is, the more stabilized the oligomer is. On the other hand, the average distances of Mg\u2013Mg, Mg\u2013O and O\u22efO edge decrease dramatically to minima as the Mg number varying from the one to two, and then increase to the value which are nearly constant (average 3.105, 2.064, 2.728 \u00c5, respectively), as shown in Fig. 2 b and Table 1 . The average bond angle Mg\u2013O\u2013Mg and O\u2013Mg\u2013O follow the similar trend to those of the average distance (average constant value 96.00\u00b0, 82.32\u00b0, respectively). The calculated average constant interatomic distances and bond angles agree well with the experimental data for brucite ( Table 1 ) [30] . This indicates that the hypothetical reaction of the formation of the layer is rational. It is worth noting that for the average distances, there have slight deviation between the mono [Mg(OH 2 ) 6 ] 2+ cluster (2.102 \u00c5) and the constant value (average 2.064 \u00c5) when Mg atom number is larger than 2. However, for the average bond angle, the deviation is much larger (89.91\u00b0 and 83.32\u00b0, respectively). This finding allows us to substantiate the earlier viewpoint that the O\u2013M\u2013O angle plays a more important role than the M\u2013O bond length during the formation of the LDH layer. On the other hand, it also suggests that the O\u2013M\u2013O angle of the mono [Mg(OH 2 ) 6 ] 2+ cluster is the main factor influencing the formation of the LDH layer. It can be expected that for the metal ion which has the close ion sizes to that of Mg 2+ , if they show the close O\u2013M\u2013O angles, their O\u2013M\u2013O angle would distort in similar values and then easily to form a layer. Otherwise, the quite different distortion of the O\u2013M\u2013O angles would lead difficulty to form a layer. As a result, studying the electronic structure of different hexahydrated metal ion which related to the LDHs is helpful for the preparation of prospective LDHs compounds or related materials. 3.2 Classification of the calculated metal cations based on the distortion angles of octahedral hexahydrated metal ions Through the geometric optimization at the DFT/(U)B3LYP level, the computation models show three different types of structure in the results ( Fig. 3 ). The optimized structures are all shown with C1 symmetry. The geometry in Fig. 3 a nearly has no distortion compared with the initial form, while Fig. 3 b and c show a slight and a flatted heavy distortion, respectively. As discussed above, the O\u2013M\u2013O angle in the octahedral hexahydrated metal ion is more crucial for the construction of LDHs layers. For the convenience to study the O\u2013M\u2013O angle, we defined the calculated structural distortion angle \u03b8 as: (2) \u03b8 = ( \u03b1 \u00af - \u03b2 \u00af ) / 2 where \u03b1 \u00af and \u03b2 \u00af denote the mean of the bond angle larger than 90\u00b0 and smaller than 90\u00b0, respectively. It can been seen from Fig. 3 a that Mg 2+ and Al 3+ both have very small distortion angle (0.09\u00b0 and 0.00\u00b0, respectively). Since Mg 2+ and Al 3+ are usually the main components of the LDHs layer, when another di- or trivalent metal ion is intend to be incorporated into the layer, it should combine with the Mg 2+ or Al 3+ to get the same O\u22efO edge length to form an octahedral dimer at first based on the hypothetical reaction. Therefore, the distortion angle difference between each divalent ions and Mg 2+ or between each trivalent ions and Al 3+ can help us to analysis the corporation of these cations to the LDHs layers. Herein, we use the distortion angle directly to classify the calculated cations due to the zero-closed distortion angles of Mg 2+ and Al 3+ . The geometries of the [M(OH 2 ) 6 ] n + models can be well characterized by their structural distortion angles. According to the values of distortion angle \u03b8 , the calculated ions can be classified into three categories as follows: (1) Type I: the canonical structure with \u03b8 in the range 0\u20131\u00b0 ( Fig. 3 a); (2) Type II: slightly distorted structure with \u03b8 of 1\u201310\u00b0 ( Fig. 3 b); (3) Type III: heavily distorted structure with \u03b8 larger than 10\u00b0 ( Fig. 3 c). The metal cations of different types and their distortion angles are also listed in Table 2 . 3.3 Geometries and electronic configurations of the hydrated cations in different cation types The optimized metal\u2013oxygen distances of three different types of ions compared with experimental values [31] are listed in Table 2 . Some of the experimental values are estimated as the sum of the effective ionic radii given by reference [7] for cations in sixfold coordination and oxygen ions O 2\u2212 (1.40 \u00c5). Recently, various metal hexahydrated ions have been investigated by means of quantum mechanical methods [20,32\u201334] . These calculations have reproduced experimental trends in metal\u2013oxygen distances or hydration energies in a reasonable way. Some of the reported values are also listed in Table 2 . For Type I, the M\u2013O bond lengths show the same value in different orientations except Cr 2+ and Mn 3+ which exhibit slightly elongated axial M\u2013O distance. This is the result of Jahn\u2013Teller effect, since in the crystal-field model where the overlap of metal and ligand orbital is neglected, the five metal d orbital split into a low-energy (t 2g ) and a high-energy (e g ) set in the octahedral field. Cr 2+ and Mn 3+ ions have the same electronic configuration d 4 with an odd number of electrons in the two metal d orbital directed toward the ligands, d z 2 and d x 2 - y 2 [35] . In the case of Type II, the first transition metal Cu 2+ (d 9 ) ion shows strong Jahn\u2013Teller effect with elongated axial M\u2013O distance, while Co 2+ (d 7 ) and Fe 2+ (d 6 ) ions with compressed axial M\u2013O distance. On the other hand, the low-spin Ru 3+ and Os 3+ (d 5 ) ions show weak Jahn\u2013Teller effect with slightly elongated axial M\u2013O distance, which is due to the uneven occupation of the degenerate t 2g orbital. In contrast to the ions in Type I, the stronger Jahn\u2013Teller effect in Type II not only elongates or compresses the axial M\u2013O distance, but also leads to heavier distortion of O\u2013M\u2013O bond angles. It should be noted that all the calculated low-spin ions are included in Type II. However, for some d 5 ions such as Mn 2+ , Ru 3+ and Os 3+ , although they have larger distorted angles in their low-spin state classified to Type II, their high-spin state are included in Type I because of the less distorted angles. Pd 2+ and Pt 2+ with d 8 configuration are the ions included in Type III. They have a triplet ground state with two electrons with parallel spins in the e g ( O h ) orbital if being set in a weak octahedral field. However, if two axial ligands are removed from the system, giving a square-planar configuration of D 4 h symmetry, the ligand field splits the e g orbital into a pair with a 1g and b lg symmetries [35] . For a strong D 4 h ligand field this energy gain may be sufficient to stabilize square-planar low-spin geometry. This is the reason why these ions show much larger distorted angles than those of in Type I and Type II in an octahedral field. On the other hand, the calculated M\u2013O lengths of different types show some characters in common. The calculated bond lengths are close to the experimental mean distances (deviations ca. 0.1 \u00c5) and in most cases longer than the experimental mean distances for the main group cations and the transition metal ions. It can be seen from Table 2 that for the transition metal ions, the M\u2013O distances of the intermediate ions are shorter than expected, with minima for the d 3 and d 8 electronic configurations which have the largest ligand field stabilization energies. This trend is very similar to the change of ionic radii shown in the references [35] . As a result, the M\u2013O distances change as follows for the same ion: divalence > trivalence; the M\u2013O distances of high-spin ions are longer than those of low-spin ions for the transition metal ions. In addition, the calculated ions in main groups (Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ ) are included in Type I and they have the closed-shelled electronic configuration. Most of the calculated transition ions in Type I show the stable configuration such as s 0 , d 0 , d 5 , d 10 or d 2 , d 3 , d 4 in high-spin state, while the ions in Type II are in transition period with d 6 or d 7 configuration in high-spin state and d 5 configuration in low-spin state, except the Ni 2+ and Cu 2+ ions with d 8 and d 9 configuration in the first transition period. However, the ions in Type III are not intended to form octahedral complexes. As a result, the high-spin state transition ions which have closed-shelled, half-filled configuration or have less electrons filled in e g orbital show less angle distortion in geometry. The only monovalent Li + ion with s 2 configuration is classified in Type III and shows two sets of M\u2013O distance along three orientations. This is evidently not caused by Jahn\u2013Teller effect, since the valence electrons are filled in s orbital without d splitting. The coordination between Li + and the ligands has no fixed orientation, as a result large distortions are found in [Li(OH 2 ) 6 ] + octahedral complex. Actually, the hydration number of Li + was 3\u20134, estimated from the chemical shift of proton NMR spectra [36] , and the lithium ion usually has only four water molecules in the first coordination sphere according to the results of the previously reported calculation [33b] . As listed in Table 2 , the calculated M\u2013O distances are in accordance with the experimental [31] and calculation values in the literature [20,32\u201334] overall. Minor differences between our calculation results and the referred ones may be caused by the different experimental conditions and computational levels. For instance, the calculated geometries of [Li(OH 2 ) x ] + ( x = 2, 3, 4) clusters in this work agree well with those in the literature [32f,33b] , but the Li\u2013O distances are slightly smaller than those reported in [33,33b] . This is due to different computational levels, i.e., MP2 and B3LYP level, which were used, respectively, in literatures and in this work. In the case of the trivalent ions of Sc, V, Cr, Mn and Fe, our calculation results also show minor differences from those of the literature [34] , which is possibly caused by the different basis sets for metal ions used ((6-31+G\u2217) in [34] and (LANL2DZ) in this work). 3.4 Binding energies of hydrated cations in different type Binding energy of a system is usually used to be a criterion for the abilities of the metal ions combining with the ligands. The binding energy, which corresponds to a gas-phase reaction at 0 K, can be obtained based on the equation: (3) \u0394 E bind = E M n + + 6 E H 2 O - E [ M(OH 2 ) 6 ] n + where E [ M ( OH 2 ) 6 ] n + denotes the total energy of the [M(OH 2 ) 6 ] n + cluster and the denotation of the other symbols are the same as those of Eq. (1) . The binding energies of the [M(OH 2 ) 6 ] n + ( n = 2, 3) clusters given in Table 2 were corrected by zero-point energy (ZPE). As shown in Table 2 , the binding energies of all ions decrease with the increase of the ionic radii and M\u2013O distance in general. For the same element, the divalent or high-spin state ion has lower binding energy than that of the trivalent or low-spin state ion. The lower binding energy of these ions is a result of the larger ion size. The overall binding energies of the 4d ions are lower than those of 3d ions while higher than those of 5d ions for the same electronic configuration in outer d shell, which is also related to the ion size. The calculation results with two different basis sets for Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ , Al 3+ , Ga 3+ and In 3+ are listed in Table 2 . Slight deviation was found between the geometry parameters such as M\u2013O bond length, bond angle distortion and binding energy calculated by LANL2DZ ECP basis sets and those calculated by all-electron 6-31G(d) basis sets or CEP-121G basis set (only for In 3+ ). However, the total energy calculated by all-electron 6-31G(d) basis sets or CEP-121G basis sets shows larger value than that of calculated by LANL2DZ ECP basis sets. Since the geometry and the binding energy are, in the present cases, not very sensitive to the change of the basis sets of the cations, we calculated all the other cations with LANL2DZ ECP basis sets in order to compute with the most efficient method yielding the necessary accuracy and make comparisons among cations at the same level. It is to be noted that since Ru 3+ , Os 3+ , Rh 3+ and Ir 3+ ions have slightly lower zero-point energy corrected total energies in low-spin than those of in high-spin (see Table S2, Supplementary Information ), it is evident that they have the low-spin grand-state, which is in agreement with the experiment results [21] . Consequently, both Ru 3+ and Os 3+ are classified into Type II. In contrast, Mn 3+ and Co 3+ are classified into Type I owing to their high-spin grand-state. For the Pd 2+ and Pt 2+ ions in Type III, although their binding energies are not very low in an octahedral field, they would show larger binding energies to attain more stable low-spin square-planar structure [21] . The calculated average binding energies of fourfold Pd 2+ and Pt 2+ clusters [M(OH 2 ) 4 ] 2+ are listed in Table 2 . They are larger than those of the sixfold ones, suggesting that they prefer to coordinate with OH 2 ligand in fourfold state to form square complexes. Furthermore, since both experimental and theoretical studies of Ca 2+ in solution indicate that 7, 8, and even 9 water molecules can be accommodated in the first solvation shell due to the large ionic radius of calcium [37] , the calculation of the seven-water coordinated Ca 2+ was performed. The same computation is carried out to Cd 2+ owing to its large ion size. The calculated binding energies of sevenfold Ca 2+ and Cd 2+ clusters [M(OH 2 ) 7 ] 2+ listed in Table 2 are larger than those of the sixfold ones. This indicates that their more stable coordination preference is sevenfold other than six, though their sixfold coordination ions are also stable with little distortion angle. It also can be seen from Table 2 that in the case of Li + , all the calculated average binding energies (equal to binding energy divided by coordination number) of [Li(OH 2 ) x ] + ( x = 2, 3, 4) clusters are larger than that of [Li(OH 2 ) 6 ] + . The calculated average binding energy increases along with x changing from 2 to 4 (38.05, 51.76 and 61.91 kcal mol \u22121 , respectively), and then declines to a lower value of 24.65 kcal mol \u22121 when x = 6. This indicates that the Li\u2013O bond is the most stable in the four-coordinated complex, and thus Li + prefers to form four- or threefold coordination complex other than sixfold one. This is consistent with the experimental results [36] . The calculated binding energies in Table 2 are in most cases larger than the calculation values in the literature, which may be caused by the different basis sets and different environments set to perform computation between our calculation and the literature work [20] . For instance, many reported data were obtained in solvent environment [20] , while no constrains are imposed in our calculation. 3.5 Natural bond orbital analysis of the selected hexahydrated metal cations For the understanding of the interaction between metal ion and OH 2 ligands in [M(OH 2 ) 6 ] n + ions, natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis was utilized in terms of a Lewis-like structure, and the M\u2013OH 2 bonds are considered as donor\u2013acceptor bonds [38] . Herein, we select the following divalent cations from different types: Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ , Zn 2+ , Cd 2+ (Type I); Fe 2+ , Co 2+ , Ni 2+ , Cu 2+ (Type II); Pd 2+ , Pt 2+ (Type III), which have been reported to be related to the formation of LDHs layers, to perform the NBO calculations. However, the same computations for trivalent cations are carried out only on Al 3+ and Ga 3+ (Type I), since they are the most common trivalent components of the LDHs. The NBO analysis provides information about the Lewis and the non-Lewis (Rydberg) structure. Therefore, the electrons are located in bonds (BD) (electron pairs centered on two atoms), lone pairs (LP) (electron pairs centered on one atom), and core pairs (CR) (electron pairs centered on the core of one atom). The analyses of the individual electron densities were carried out separately for \u03b1 (spin-up) and \u03b2 (spin-down) orientations for the open-shelled systems. The latter reflect the two different opportunities by which a single electron can occupy a metal orbital in terms of the spin direction [27] . The percentage of the \u201cnatural lewis structure\u201d, NLMO/NPA bond orders between metal cation and oxygen atoms, the significant NBO interactions and their NBO stabilization energies E (2) along the different orientations are listed in Table 3 A. All the studied systems present more than 99% natural lewis structure, suggesting the dominance of the Lewis-type component of the bonding. Firstly, let us focus the discussion on hexahydrated metal ions containing divalent cations. In general, the NBO representations of all systems studied show similar characteristics. The calculations of NBOs predict that they do not present a BD between the oxygen atoms and the divalent cations, i.e., no formal metal\u2013oxygen bonding orbital is identified among the NBOs in each of these studied divalent octahedral hexahydrated metal ions. In contrast, as shown in Table 3 A, the interaction between the metal atom and oxygen atom is seen through an electronic delocalization between bond orbitals from O hybrid orbitals containing s character and p character to metal pure ( n + 1)s or d orbitals. The electronic delocalizations are estimated by second order perturbation theory from the stabilization energy E (2) associated with the donor\u2013acceptor interaction between two NBOs [28b] . For the divalent systems including Type I and Type II cations, the most significant interactions are delocalization from O sp hybrid orbitals to metal ( n + 1)s orbitals. On the other hand, for the open-shelled hexahydrated metal ions consisting of Fe 2+ , Co 2+ , Ni 2+ and Cu 2+ , another second significant interaction takes place from O sp hybrid orbitals to metal d orbitals, since these metal ions have unoccupied d orbitals. Pre-NBOs (PNBOs), which are a set of localized Lewis NBO precursors that lack the final interatomic orthogonalization step, provide a convenient way to visualize interactions between orbitals in different bond regions, because their overlap is proportional to their interaction energy [39] . The 3D view and 2D contour of pre-NBOs for the most significant interactions of the calculated Type I and Type II divalent hexahydrated metal ions are illustrated on xz plane in Fig. 4 a. It is shown that the \u03c3 -interaction from O sp hybrid orbitals to metal ( n + 1)s orbitals are very strong in these systems. However, it is quite different for the Type III (Pd 2+ , Pt 2+ ) systems. The most significant interactions are not the delocalization from O sp hybrid orbitals to metal ( n + 1)s orbitals, but the delocalization from O sp 2 hybrid orbitals to metal d orbitals, as displayed in Fig. 4 b. It can be seen from Fig. 4 a and b that the overlap between O sp x lone pair and Mg 3s orbital in [Mg(OH 2 ) 6 ] 2+ displays the same phase, but the overlap between O sp 2 x lone pair and Pd 4 d z 2 - 4 d x 2 - y 2 hybrid orbital in [Pd (OH 2 ) 6 ] 2+ shows the opposite phase, indicating the more stronger M\u2013O interaction in [Mg(OH 2 ) 6 ] 2+ . The contributions of n d interaction and ( n +1)s \u03c3 -interaction to charge transfer in [M(OH 2 ) 6 ] n + in electrons are reported in Table 3 B. The amount of electron density shifted from the oxygen donor lone pairs (LPs) to the metal ions was judged by means of occupation numbers of the formally unoccupied n d and ( n +1)s orbitals in the NBO basis for divalent cations. Applications of this method in the analysis of electronic structure of 3d [M(H 2 O) 6 ] 3+ ions have been reported recently [34] . As can be seen in Table 3 B, the total amount of charge transfer obtained in this way is virtually identical to the occupancy of n d and ( n +1)s orbitals of natural electron configuration of the systems obtained via natural population analysis (NPA) of the natural atomic orbitals (NAOs) [27a] . The agreement between these numbers shows that delocalization of metal electrons into empty antibonding orbitals at the ligands and n p metal orbitals does not contribute significantly to the M\u2013L interaction in these cases. In addition, the system including closed-shelled Type I cations (Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ , Zn 2+ , Cd 2+ ) shows the strongest \u03c3 -interaction (>80%) and the weakest d interaction (<0.1%); the system including open-shelled Type II cations (Fe 2+ , Co 2+ , Ni 2+ , Cu 2+ ) shows the moderate \u03c3 -interaction and d interaction (about 50%); Type III cations (Pd 2+ , Pt 2+ ) contained system exhibits the weakest \u03c3 -interaction (<40%) and the strongest d interaction (>59%). From this point of view, the Type I cations reveal the strongest stability in hexahydrated metal ions, while the stability of the Type III cations are not significant, since the s orbital is sphere and the interaction between s orbital and O LPs are stronger than that of between d orbital and O LPs along three orientations. This is consistent with the result which has been obtained above. The most common trivalent cation components in LDHs layers, Al 3+ and Ga 3+ (Type I), have also been demonstrated by the NBO analysis. As displayed in Table 3 A and B and Fig. 4 c, formal metal\u2013oxygen bonding orbital exists in these studied systems, and the most significant interaction is the delocalization from the M\u2013O \u03c3 -bonding orbital to the M\u2013O \u03c3 -antibonding orbital. These interactions are very strong with larger stabilization energies E (2) (17.89 and 21.56 kcal mol \u22121 for Al and Ga hexahydrated metal ions, respectively) than those of divalent systems except Mg 2+ (26.22 kcal mol \u22121 ). This further confirms the relative stability of octahedral hexahydrated metal ions containing Mg 2+ , Al 3+ and Ga 3+ . The natural localized molecular orbitals/natural population analysis (NLMO/NPA) bond orders [27] in Table 3 A indicate the interaction of the M\u2013L bonding. The bond orders are listed for three orientations( x , y and z ) and two spin states ( \u03b1 and \u03b2 ). It is well known that the larger the bonder order is, the stronger the bond strength is. As shown in Table 3 A, the systems including closed-shelled Type I cations represent the same bond order in different orientations, indicating the same strength of each M\u2013L bond in different orientations. Moreover, trivalent cations Al 3+ and Ga 3+ have much larger bond orders (0.1521 and 0.1736, respectively) than those of divalent cations. This suggests that the octahedral hexahydrated metal ions consisting of these cations possess canonical geometries, which is in agreement with the previous calculations. It can be expected that distortion will occur if the bond strength of the different orientations shows different value. Therefore, the calculated systems including Type II and Type III cation exhibit different bond orders along different orientations, implying their distorted geometries. For the purpose of estimating of the distortion, the difference between the maximum and minimum of the M\u2013L bond orders (\u0394BO) of each system has been listed in Table 3 A. The \u0394BOs of the Type II cations are less than the Type III cation, which indicates that the distortions in hexahydrated metal ions including Type II are weaker than those in Type III. This accounts well for the above-mentioned trend in distortion angle: Type I < Type II < Type III. Furthermore, the Jahn\u2013Teller effect of some ions was also suggested by the bond order analysis. The Cu 2+ (d 9 ) ion shows strong Jahn\u2013Teller effect with much longer axial M\u2013O bond orders than the equatorial ones, which leads to the elongated axial M\u2013O bond length. In contrast, Co 2+ (d 7 ) and Fe 2+ (d 6 ) ions exhibit slightly shorter axial M\u2013O bond orders than the equatorial ones, which induces their compressed axial M\u2013O distance. On the other hand, for the Pd 2+ and Pt 2+ ions, the bond orders of two orientations are larger than that of the third orientation, indicating the preference of Pd 2+ and Pt 2+ cations for square-planar coordination than for the octahedral sites. 3.6 The template effect of the hydrated metal ions in the construction of LDHs sheets related to the different types The hexahydrated octahedral coordination cations, the initial template to form LDHs sheets, show different characters in different types. Therefore, whether an ion can combine with Mg 2+ to form LDHs sheet easily is related closely to the type in which they are included, i.e., the distortion angles of their hexahydrated ions. From this point of view, we summarized the previous reports on different ions related to the formation of LDHs and made comparison with our calculations. Table S3 (Supplementary Information) lists the relationship between the reported ions which have been introduced into LDHs layers and the ionic classification in this work. Table S3A indicates that the reported metal ions introduced into LDHs layers with relatively large amount (>10% atomic ratio percent) include more cations in Type I than in Type II, and the reported Type II ions are all in 3d transition period. When a hexahydrated cation in Type I combine with Mg 2+ or Al 3+ , the close distortion angles of them (the difference is not larger than 1.00\u00b0) would make each of them to be flatted with the similar angle to obtain a stable structure. As for 3d Type II ions, which have larger distortion angles than those of Type I, when combined with Mg 2+ and Al 3+ , the flatted angle of them will be different, which would need more energy to maintain a stable structure. This suggests that Type II ions are more difficult to be incorporate into the LDHs layer. In spite of the fact that the 3d divalent ions in Type II can combine with Al 3+ to construct binary LDHs layers, the resulting LDHs are usually not very stable to maintain pure phase, especially for Cu 2+ ion owing to the relatively large distortion angle caused by strong Jahn\u2013Teller effect [2] . Thus, they are generally to be incorporated into LDHs layers in the presence of other Type I or Type II cations with the same valence. For instance, Cu 2+ ion could be introduced into the layers with a certain ratio of other divalent ions in order to get a stable layer structure. It has been reported that the atomic ratio of the divalent ions effects remarkably on the stability of the Cu-Ni-Mg-Al LDHs: a stable LDH can be obtained only under the condition of Mg 2 + / \u2211 ( M 2 + ) = 0.250 , Cu 2 + / \u2211 ( M 2 + ) < 0.438 or Mg 2 + / \u2211 ( M 2 + ) = 0.500 , Cu 2 + / \u2211 ( M 2 + ) < 0.375 [40] . Other cations such as Fe 2+ and Co 2+ which also show Jahn\u2013Teller effect can be easily oxidized to trivalent cations. As a result, three-component LDHs containing one element with different valence such as Mg-Co(II)-Co(III) LDHs and Co-Fe(II)-Fe(III) LDHs have been reported by controlling preparation conditions [41,42] . The Ni 2+ ion is the only divalent ion in Type II which can form stable binary LDHs with Type I ions for its weak Jahn\u2013Teller effect ( Table 2 ). On the other hand, for the noble metals such as Ru 3+ , Os 3+ , Rh 3+ , Ir 3+ included in Type II and Pd 2+ and Pt 2+ ions ( Table S3B ) included in Type III, although there have been reports in an attempt to incorporate these ions into LDHs layers owing to their excellent catalytic properties, the resulting materials only contained trace amount of them (0.04\u20135.0% atomic ratio percent), or just be supported by LDHs, especially for Pt 2+ and Pd 2+ [8] . This is due to the stronger preference of Pd 2+ and Pt 2+ cations for square-planar coordination than the octahedral sites of brucite-type sheets of the LDHs structure. It has also been reported that Ru 3+ , Rh 3+ and Ir 3+ can be introduced into the LDHs layers with trace amount but more easily than Pd 2+ and Pt 2+ [8h] , which is in agreement with the distortion angles of their hexahydrated ions. Based on the discussion above, it can be concluded that the easiness of the metal ions to be introduced into LDHs layers is in the following order: Type I > Type II > Type III. From this point of view, it is easy to understand the fact mentioned in the introduction section that both Pd 2+ and Pt 2+ , with much closer ionic radius to Mg 2+ , were hard to be introduced into LDHs layer because of the large distortion angle (10.29\u00b0 and 13.22\u00b0, respectively), which is related to their preferential coordination of fourfold but not the sixfold environment in a LDH layer. In contrast, Ca 2+ and Cd 2+ , with much larger ionic radius than that of Mg 2+ , have been reported to be incorporated into LDHs layers to form stable structure. Based on our calculation, although the octahedral sixfold hydrated ions are stable with small distortion angle (0.20\u00b0 and 0.31\u00b0, respectively), their sevenfold coordination are more stable due to their large size. For Cd 2+ , the coordination environment in Cd-Al-LDH is still unclear in report [10] . However, in fact, the reported Ca 2 Al-LDHs are, indeed, among the most stable. And each Ca 2+ in this structure can be more accurately described as being 7-coordinated, with the 7th oxygen being provided by a water molecule from the interlayer [9] . This is accordance with the calculation in this work, and also suggest that when an ion\u2019s size is much larger than that of Mg 2+ , it is possible for it to get more than sixfold coordination with interlayer ions but not only coordinate with the oxygen in LDH layer, so as to obtain a more stable structure. It should be pointed out that although Li + is classified into Type III in this work, many researchers reported its incorporation into LDHs layers (only Li-Al-LDHs) [6] . In fact, the formation mechanism of the well known unique Li-Al LDHs is different from that of the brucite-like M(II)-M(III) LDHs. The crystal structure of Li-Al LDH formulated by [LiAl 2 (OH) 6 ] + [A n - ] 1/ n \u00b7 y H 2 O is derived from gibbsite ( \u03b3 -Al(OH) 3 ) in which the lithium ions are located in the remaining one-third of the octahedral holes within the Al(OH) 3 layers which are not filled by Al 3+ ions [6a] . From this point of view, it can also be understood that the Li + is an exception for the distortion angle rule in the construction of brucite-like LDHs based on our calculation. Consequently, when the ion which is intend to be introduced into the LDHs layer has the close ionic radius to Mg 2+ , the distortion angle of the octahedral hydrated ions plays a more important role to direct stability of the structure in the construction of LDHs layers. On the other hand, for the ions which have much larger size than Mg 2+ , the possibility of their more-than-6 coordination preference is important in the formation of LDHs. 4 Conclusions A series of density functional calculation of the hexahydrated octahedral coordination metal cations with model formula [M(OH 2 ) 6 ] n + (M = metal cation, n = 2, 3 and 1 for M = Li) were performed at DFT/B3LYP level, for the purpose of understanding the template effect of these ions in the formation of LDHs layers and finding out which cation can be introduced into the LDHs layers easily. For the cation with similar ion size to Mg 2+ , the computational models presented here have succeeded in exhibiting the structure directing relationship between initial template octahedral hexahydrated cations and the relative stability of related LDHs. The structural properties of the hexahydrated cations, such as metal\u2013oxygen bond length, O\u2013M\u2013O bond angle distortion, binding energy, valence electronic configuration, ligand field, Jahn\u2013Teller effect and natural bond orbital (NBO), which are related to the construction of LDHs layers have been systematically illustrated and were in good agreement with the experimental results. In conclusion, the distortion angle of an octahedral coordination hexahydrated cation has been quantitatively revealed to play a significant role in the formation of LDHs layers on the basis of our DFT theoretical calculation results. The metal cations which can form the canonical hexahydrated structure with the distortion angle ( \u03b8 ) smaller than 1\u00b0 are easily incorporated into LDHs layers to form stable structures, while those which form octahedral hexahydrated structure in heavy distortion with \u03b8 larger than 10\u00b0 are difficult to be introduced into LDHs layers. Co-working with the ion size rule, the distortion angles of hexahydrated cations will surely play important part in giving clear hint to the design and preparation of LDHs and related materials with prospective applications.

        "abstract": "This paper reports patterned films with thermal colorimetric and fluorescent response fabricated by a combined approach based on electrophoretic deposition (EPD)-photolithography. A composite film of diacetylene (DA)/layered double hydroxide (LDH) was prepared by the method of EPD, and the photolithography technique was subsequently employed to further obtain a polydiacetylene (PDA)/LDH patterned fluorescence film via UV-induced polymerization of DA in the two-dimensional (2D) gallery of LDH matrix. The PDA/LDH film shows a well c-orientation of LDH platelets (the ab plane of the LDH platelets parallel to the substrate) confirmed by XRD and SEM. Both the in situ UV-vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectroscopy indicate that the composite film exhibits marked thermal colorimetric and fluorescent behavior in the temperature range 20-130 \u00b0C, which is reversible over a number of heating/cooling cycles. It should be noted that the pristine PDA shows no reversible thermal colorimetric and fluorescent performance at all. The transformation of an organic chromophore from irreversible to reversible thermal response material upon incorporation into a 2D layered matrix is the most distinct feature in this work. It was demonstrated that the thermally response behavior resulted from the strong hydrogen bond interaction between the PDA and LDH matrix, which was confirmed by in situ Raman and in situ attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR FT-IR) spectroscopy. Therefore, this work provides new opportunities for the fabrication of thermally responsive patterned films with high stability and reversibility, which can be used in intelligent response and display devices. \u00a9 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "Multi-color emission materials (especially white light) have broad applications in optoelectronics, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and optical devices. This work describes the fabrication of multicolor and white-light-emitting ultrathin films (UTFs) with 2D architecture based on CdTe quantum dots (QDs: red or green emission), an organic chromophore (BTBS: blue emission) and MgAl layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets via the layer-by-layer assembly method. The hybrid UTFs possess a periodic long-range ordered layered structure, which is verified by X-ray diffraction. By rational selection of the building unit and control of the assembly sequence, the luminescence color of the resulting UTFs can be precisely tuned throughout the whole visible-light region. Especially, finely controlled white-light emission was successfully achieved with the color coordinates at (0.322, 0.324), rather close to the standard coordinates of white light (0.333, 0.333). In addition, the QDs-BTBS-LDH UTF displays intelligent photoluminescence behavior, i.e., white, orange, or red emission can be obtained for the same UTF by changing the excitation light. Therefore, this work provides a facile approach for accurate fabrication of multi-color/white-light photoemission UTFs, which is expected to be used in full-color displays, sensing and intelligent response.

        "abstract": "The chemoselective hydrogenation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds is one of the most important and challenging chemical processes in the fine chemical synthesis field, where intermetallic compounds (IMCs) have attracted extensive interest as efficient catalysts. In this work, we demonstrate the preparation of several Ni-In IMCs (Ni3In, Ni2In, NiIn, and Ni 2In3) with a tunable particle size via the utilization of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) precursors that exhibit largely enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity toward the hydrogenation of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes. H2-TPR and semi-in situ XRD measurements reveal a coreduction process in the topotactic transformation of NiIn-LDHs materials to Ni-In IMCs. The catalytic behavior toward various unsaturated carbonyl compounds (e.g., furfural, 1-phenyltanol, crotonaldehyde, and 2-hexenal) can be improved by the modulation of the Ni/In ratio and the particle size of these Ni-In IMCs. For instance, a yield of 99% for the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol was obtained over supported Ni2In catalyst (particle size 5.1 nm, 110 C, 3 MP, 2 h). The XAFS characterization and DFT calculation further reveal the electron transfer and active-site isolation in Ni-In IMCs, accounting for the largely enhanced hydrogenation selectivity. The control over the activity and selectivity of Ni-In IMCs catalysts makes them promising candidates for the chemoselective hydrogenation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

The film of H-acid/LDH with the thickness of 1 \u03bcm possesses a well c-orientation of the LDH microcrystals confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The fluorescence detection for Hg(II) in aqueous solution was performed by using the H-acid/LDH film sensor at pH 7.0, with a linear response range in 1.0 \u00d7 10(-7) to 1.0 \u00d7 10(-5) mol L(-1) and a detection limit of 6.3 \u00d7 10(-8) mol L(-1). Furthermore, it exhibits excellent selectivity for Hg(II) over a large number of competitive cations including alkali, alkaline earth, heavy metal and transitional metals. The specific fluorescence response of the optical sensor is attributed to the coordination between Hg(II) and sulfonic group in the H-acid immobilized in the LDH matrix, which was verified by NMR spectroscopy and UV-vis spectra. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculation further confirms that the coordination occurs between one Hg(2+) and two O atoms in the sulfonic group, which is responsible for the significant fluorescence quenching of the H-acid/LDH film. The results indicate that the H-acid/LDH composite film can be potentially used as a chemosensor for the detection of Hg(2+) in the environmental and biomedical field.",

In this work, we report the layer-by-layer co-assembly of two types of two-color (blue/red) luminescent ultrathin films (UTFs) by using different photofunctional anions (optical brightener VBL, sulfonated poly(thiophene), and tris(1,10-phenanthroline-4,7-diphenylsulfonate) ruthenium(ii)) and Mg-Al-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets as the basic building blocks. UV-visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy showed an orderly growth of the two types of UTFs upon increasing the number of deposition cycles. XRD and SEM measurements indicated that the films feature periodic layered structure as well as uniform surface morphology. Moreover, these UTFs can exhibit well-defined two-color polarized fluorescence with high polarization anisotropy. In addition, changeable ratiometric luminescence can also be obtained at different viewing angles. Therefore, this work provides a facile way of fabricating two-color UTFs which have potential applications in the areas of both polarized multi-color emission and angle-dependent luminescent materials. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.",

HRTEM, HAADF-STEM, EXAFS, and positron annihilation spectroscopy demonstrate the existence of abundant surface vacancy clusters that serve as active sites, accounting for the significantly enhanced low-temperature activity of the supported Ni nanoparticles.

Benefiting from the atomic-scale uniform distribution of metal cations in the brucite-like layers and the ability to intercalate a diverse range of interlayer anions, LDHs display great potential as precursors/supports to prepare catalysts, in that the catalytic sites can be preferentially orientated, highly dispersed, and firmly stabilized to afford excellent catalytic performance and recyclability. The approaches to prepare catalysts based on LDH materials include, but are not limited to, exfoliation of the brucite-like layers, lattice orientation/lattice confinement by the brucite-like layers, and intercalation.

This paper reports the UV-shielding mechanism of layered double hydroxide (LDH) materials in terms of chemical composition, structure and morphology, by using (LDH/PAA)n films (n stands for bilayer number) through alternate LBL assembly of LDH nanoparticles and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) on quartz substrates as a model system. A combination investigation based on experimental and theoretical study demonstrates that the maximum UV scattering can be achieved when \u03bb/d \u2248 1.98; the introduction of Zn element is an effective way to tune the electron structure, band gap, transition mode and resulting UV-shielding property of LDH materials. A UV-shielding efficiency as high as 95% can be obtained by modulating the particle size, composition and thickness of the LDHs. Furthermore, the UV anti-aging capacity of LDH-modified bitumen was studied, which demonstrates a large improvement in UV-resistance performance of bitumen by the incorporation of LDH materials. Therefore, this work systematically discloses the relationship between UV-shielding property and chemical/structural parameters of LDH materials, which can be potentially used as anti-aging agents in various organic matrices and polymer areas.",

The structure and composition of the intercalated materials have been studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP). The study indicates that the 2,3-PDC and 2,5-PDC anions are accommodated as interdigitated bilayer and monolayer arrangement respectively between the sheets of LDHs. Furthermore, their thermal decomposition processes were studied by the use of in situ high temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD), and the combined technique of thermogravimetry- differential thermal analysis-mass spectrometry (TG-DTA-MS) under N2 atmosphere. Based on the comparison study on the temperatures of both decarboxylation and complete decomposition of interlayer PDC, it can be concluded that 2,5-PDC-ZnAl-LDHs has higher thermal stability than that of 2,3-PDC-ZnAl-LDHs. \u00a9 2006 Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3.",

        "title": "The synthesis of hierarchical Zn\u2013Ti layered double hydroxide for efficient visible-light photocatalysis",
        "abstract": "Zn\u2013Ti layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with different Zn/Ti ratio have been synthesized by co-precipitation of zinc and titanium salts from homogeneous solution, which were demonstrated as efficient visible-light photocatalysts. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) revealed that the resulting Zn\u2013Ti LDHs possess high crystallinity, hierarchical structure as well as large specific surface area (91.96\u2013107.9 m 2 g \u22121 ). UV\u2013vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS) confirmed that Zn\u2013Ti LDHs show a broad absorption in visible light region (400\u2013700 nm). With a low band gap of \u223c3.06 eV, the as-prepared Zn\u2013Ti LDHs displayed significant photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible-light irradiation (\u223c100% of degradation percentage in 100 min), which is much higher than that of commercial product (Degussa P25). Therefore, this work provides a detailed understanding of semiconductor properties of Zn\u2013Ti LDHs which was unrevealed previously, and demonstrates its potential application in the field of photocatalysis. Keywords Layered double hydroxides Photocatalysis Visible-light Methylene blue 1 Introduction Energy shortage and environmental deterioration have become the major obstacles to the development of economy and society in the past decades. With wide applications in solar energy conversion and environmental remediation (water purification and decontamination, deodorization of air etc.), photocatalysis using semiconductors has been extensively investigated [1] . Many materials including TiO 2 and ZnO, have attracted great interests as promising photocatalysts in areas of environment and energy, due to their high photocatalytic activity, resistance to photocorrosion, photo-stability, low cost and non-toxicity. However, they only can be activated under UV-light irradiation because of large band gap [2] , resulting in a low photo-electronic transition efficiency since the ultraviolet light is only 4% in solar spectrum. Therefore, photocatalysts that respond to visible-light are needed to improve the utilization of sunlight for production of hydrogen energy by splitting water [3,4] , degradation of organic pollutants [5,6] and other applications. Traditional visible-light photocatalysts are either unstable upon illumination with light (e.g., CdS, CdSe) or have low activity (e.g., WO 3 , Fe 2 O 3 ) [7,8] . Visible-light semiconductor photocatalysts consisting of anion doping [9\u201312] (N, C, S) and metal doping in MTiO 2 (M = Fe, V, Cr, Mn) [13,14] have attracted much attention, for the purpose of introducing energy levels in the band gap. Recently, Dionysiou et al. synthesized N\u2013F-codoped TiO 2 which showed highly efficient visible light-activated photocatalysis [15] . Intermediate states of the energy levels in the band gap lead to visible light absorption which increases light-harvesting abilities. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are a large class of typical inorganic layered host materials which can be described by the general formula [M II 1\u2212 x M III x (OH) 2 ] z + (A n \u2212 ) z / n \u00b7 y H 2 O (M II and M III are divalent and trivalent metals, respectively; A n \u2212 is the interlayer anion compensating for the positive charge of the brucite-like layers). The tunable metal ions in a wide range without altering the structure of the material and anion exchange properties of LDH materials make them attractive candidates as catalysts or catalyst precursors [16\u201320] , ion exchangers [21] and absorbents [22,23] . Furthermore, thermal decomposition of LDH materials at moderate temperature (300\u2013600 \u00b0C) leads to the formation of highly active mixed metal oxides (MMOs) nanocomposites with high specific surface area and thermal stability [24\u201327] , which have been used as photocatalysts for the decomposition of dye or phenol in water [24,27,28] . In our previous work, a combined method of atomic layered deposition \u2013 in situ growth \u2013 calcination was reported to fabricate hierarchical MMO framework, which was used as an efficient photocatalyst for the decomposition of sulforhodamine B and an azobenzene-containing polymer [29] . Although MMO materials as photocatalysts have been thoroughly studied, the application of LDHs in photocatalysis was rarely investigated. Metal hydroxides were seldom applied as photocatalysts, for the photoinduced electron could be easily captured by hydroxyl groups. Recently however, Garcia et al. reported the visible oxygen generation from water with photocatalysis of Zn\u2013M LDH (M = Cr, Ti, Ce), and the results showed that the LDH can be regarded as \u201cdoped semiconductors\u201d [30] . This motivates us to further study the semiconductor properties of LDH materials, owing to the low-cost, easy preparation and environmental friendliness. In this work, the Zn\u2013Ti LDH with hierarchical structure has been synthesized by the co-precipitation method, which exhibited effective photocatalysis for the decomposition of methylene blue (MB) in water. The synthesized Zn\u2013Ti LDH possesses microspheric morphology with diameter of 5\u201310 \u03bcm which consists of two-dimensional thin nanoflakes (width and length: 1\u20132 \u03bcm; thickness: 80\u2013120 nm). It was found that the Zn\u2013Ti LDH displayed superior photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible-light irradiation compared with TiO 2 , ZnO and P25, as a result of its hierarchical structure, high specific surface area (91.96\u2013107.9 m 2 g \u22121 ) as well as low band gap (\u223c3.06 eV). Moreover, Zn\u2013Ti LDH showed the advantages of low-cost preparation, structural durability and long-term sustainability. Therefore, this work provides a facile approach for the preparation of Zn\u2013Ti LDH with rather high photocatalytic activity in the visible-light region, which can be used in the field of pollutant degradation of water treatment. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Analytical grade chemicals including Zn(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O, TiCl 4 , NH 4 NO 3 were purchased from the Beijing Chemical Co. Limited and used without further purification. The deionized and decarbonated water was used in all the preparation processes. 2.2 Synthesis The Zn\u2013Ti LDH was prepared by co-precipitation of zinc and titanium salts from homogeneous solution. A typical synthetic procedure is as follows: 0.22 ml of TiCl 4 , 1.19 g of Zn(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O and 3.0 g of urea were dissolved in 100 ml of deionized water under vigorous stirring. The resulting reactant was aged in an autoclave at 130 \u00b0C for 48 h. The precipitate was centrifuged and washed thoroughly with water and finally dried overnight at 60 \u00b0C. The Zn\u2013Ti LDHs with different molar ratio of Zn 2+ /Ti 4+ were prepared using the same procedure by varying Ti 4+ dosage. 2.3 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction of Zn\u2013Ti LDH samples were collected on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer using a Cu K\u03b1 source, with a scan step of 0.02\u00b0 and a scan range between 3\u00b0 and 70\u00b0. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a Thermo VG ESCALAB250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer at a pressure of about 2 \u00d7 10 \u22129 Pa using Al K\u03b1 X-ray as the excitation source. The morphology of the Zn\u2013Ti LDH was investigated using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Zeiss Supra 55) with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV, combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) for the determination of metal composition. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded with Philips TECNAI-20 and JEOL JEM-2010 high-resolution transmission electron microscopes. The accelerating voltage was 200 kV. The specific surface area determination and pore volume and size analysis were performed by Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) and Barret\u2013Joyner\u2013Halender (BJH) methods using a Quantachrome Autosorb-1C-VP Analyzer. Prior to the measurements, the samples were degassed at 120 \u00b0C for 5 h. Solid-state UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded at room temperature in air by means of a Shimadzu UV-3000 spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere attachment using BaSO 4 as background. 2.4 Photocatalytic reactions The photocatalytic activity of Zn\u2013Ti LDH was monitored by degradation of methylene blue (MB) under irradiation with visible-light. Pure ZnO, TiO 2 , Degussa P25 were performed as reference samples, respectively. The visible-light irradiation source was a 300 W xenon lamp equipped with a wavelength pass filter with a length of 420 nm. Running water was circulated through the jacket to ensure constant temperature of the reaction mixture, which was stirred magnetically. Typically, a mixture of 60 ml of MB (1.6 \u00d7 10 \u22125 M) solution and 60 mg of catalyst was vigorously stirred for 30 min to establish an adsorption/desorption equilibrium. Then the reaction solution was stirred under visible-light irradiation. At given time intervals, 3 ml aliquots were sampled and centrifuged to remove the particles. The filtrates were analyzed by measuring the absorption band maximum (664 nm) using a Shimadzu UV-3000 UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer. The blank reaction was carried out following the same procedure without adding catalyst. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of Zn\u2013Ti LDHs Fig. 1 A illustrates the powder XRD patterns for Zn\u2013Ti LDHs with Zn 2+ /Ti 4+ molar ratio of 2:1, 3:1 and 4:1 in the preparation process. A strong reflection (0 0 3) was observed for the three samples; XRD patterns also show the reflections of (0 0 6), (0 0 9), (1 0 0), (1 0 1), (0 1 2), (1 1 0) and (1 1 3) which can be indexed to typical LDH materials [31] . It was found that the basal reflection (2 \u03b8 \u2248 13.2\u00b0, d 0 0 3 = 0.66 nm) of Zn\u2013Ti LDHs displays a little shift to higher scattering angle compared with natural and synthetic carbonate-containing hydrotalcites with divalent and trivalent cations in the host layers (2 \u03b8 \u2248 11.7\u00b0, d 0 0 3 = 0.76 nm) [32,33] , indicating that the basal spacing decreases with the incorporation of tetravalent metal (Ti) in hydrotalcite materials. This is in accordance with the previous report on Ti-containing LDHs [30] . The contraction in the interlayer distance of Zn\u2013Ti\u2013CO 3 LDH is possibly related to the reason that the presence of Ti 4+ results in a strong electrostatic interaction between host layer and guest carbonate. Several weak reflections at 2 \u03b8 = 22\u00b0, 31\u00b0 and 36\u00b0 were observed, which can be assigned to small amount of zinc hydroxide impurity (PDF Card No. 20-1437). XPS measurement shows that the surface is essentially dominated by Ti 4+ ( Fig. 1 B). The Ti 2p 1/2 and Ti 2p 2/3 spin-orbital splitting photo-electrons for Zn\u2013Ti LDH are located at binding energies of 463.6 and 458.0 eV, respectively. The peak separation of 5.6 eV between the Ti 2p 1/2 and 2p 2/3 signals is in well agreement with the reported value [34] . The FT-IR technique was also used to identify the nature and symmetry of interlayer anions (see Supporting Information Fig. S1 ). The spectrum showed a broad intense band between 3500 and 3100 cm \u22121 due to the OH stretching mode of hydroxyl groups in host layers and interlayer water molecules. The band at 1503 cm \u22121 together with its accompanying band at 1398 cm \u22121 is attributed to mode \u03bd 3 of interlayer carbonate species [35] . The SEM coupled with EDX and TEM image of the Zn\u2013Ti LDH (molar ratio Zn/Ti of 3:1) are shown in Fig. 2 . The synthesized Zn\u2013Ti LDH shows microspheric morphology with a diameter of about 5\u201310 \u03bcm ( Fig. 2 A). The high-magnification SEM image of an individual microsphere ( Fig. 2 B) clearly exhibits the presence of hierarchical structure consisting of two-dimensional thin nanoflakes with 1\u20132 \u03bcm in width and length and 80\u2013120 nm in thickness. More importantly, these nanoflakes form a 3D architecture involving macropores with different size, which may serve as paths for transportation of species. The energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) analysis of the Zn\u2013Ti LDH ( Fig. 2 C) shows the presence of Zn, Ti and O with a Zn/Ti molar ratio of \u223c3.2, approximately matching with the nominal ratio (Zn/Ti = 3.0). The structure of Zn\u2013Ti LDH material was further characterized by HR-TEM image ( Fig. 2 D). The pattern of individual nanoflake of Zn\u2013Ti LDH exhibits hexagonally arranged spots ( Fig. 2 D, inset), confirming the single-crystal nature [36] . The lattice with a d spacing of 0.15 nm was observed, corresponding to the (1 1 3) plane of the Zn\u2013Ti LDH phase. This value is in accordance with the in-plane structural parameter of Zn\u2013Ti LDH crystal determined from the XRD characterization ( d 1 1 3 = 0.155 nm). To give a further insight on the specific surface area and porosity of the as-prepared Zn\u2013Ti LDH, nitrogen sorption measurement was carried out. Fig. 3 displays the N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherm and the corresponding pore size distribution curve for the Zn\u2013Ti LDH samples with different molar ratios. The Zn\u2013Ti LDH material exhibits a typical IV isotherm with a H3-type hysteresis loop ( P / P 0 > 0.4), indicating the presence of mesopores. Furthermore, any limiting adsorption at higher P / P 0 was not observed, indicative of the existence of macropores [37] . This is in accordance with the SEM observations ( Fig. 2 B). This result is further confirmed by the corresponding wide distribution of pore size in Fig. 3 B (15\u2013100 nm, maximum at 65 nm), resulting from the hierarchical structure stacking of LDH nanoflakes. A high specific surface area (91.96\u2013107.88 m 2 g \u22121 ) was obtained for the three Zn\u2013Ti LDHs owing to the hierarchical structure. 3.2 Photocatalytic activities To demonstrate the potential applicability of Zn\u2013Ti LDH in photocatalysis, the photodegradation of MB was carried out under irradiation with visible-light ( \u03bb > 420 nm). 60 mg of catalyst was added into a 60 ml of MB (1.6 \u00d7 10 \u22125 M) solution and stirred vigorously for 30 min in dark to establish an adsorption/desorption equilibrium. Then the solution was stirred under visible-light irradiation for photocatalytic reaction. The Zn\u2013Ti LDH photocatalyst was dispersed in MB solution under irradiation of visible-light, and the absorption spectra of the solution as a function of irradiation time were recorded by using a UV\u2013vis spectrometer. The decomposed percentage of MB was calculated by C / C 0 , where C and C 0 are the absorbance intensity of the sample at time intervals and initial state, respectively. The strong absorption bands of MB located at \u03bb = 292 nm and \u03bb = 664 nm decreased gradually upon increasing irradiation time and the absorbance of dye solution was close to zero after 100 min of irradiation for Zn/Ti = 3:1 LDH catalyst ( Fig. 4 ). In addition, the solution color changed from an initial deep blue to nearly transparent during the degradation process of MB. Taking into account the important role of Ti in the photocatalysis, the influence of molar ratio of Zn/Ti on its photocatalytic activity was also studied, which are shown in Fig. S2 . It was found that all the Zn\u2013Ti LDHs with 2:1, 3:1 and 4:1 displayed high photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation. The decomposition of MB by the Zn\u2013Ti LDH (Zn/Ti = 3:1) reaches \u223c100% over 100 min, comparative to \u223c95% and \u223c96% by the samples with Zn/Ti = 2:1 and 4:1, respectively. The Zn\u2013Ti LDH (Zn/Ti = 3:1) shows the strongest absorption in the visible light region among the three samples (shown in Fig. S3 ), accounting for the highest photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic behavior of Zn\u2013Ti LDH was further evaluated by a comparison study with the performance of TiO 2 , ZnO as well as P25. As shown in Fig. 5 , MB degraded \u223c40% under light exposure without catalyst, indicating that photolysis reaction also contributes to the degradation of the dye. However, the photodegradation of MB was enhanced remarkably with the presence of Zn\u2013Ti LDH (Zn/Ti = 3:1). Especially, the photocatalytic activity of the Zn\u2013Ti LDH (Zn/Ti = 3:1) was significantly higher than that of commercial P25. As shown in Fig. S4 , the plots of ln( C 0 / C ) vs irradiation time suggest that the photodegradation of MB follows the pseudo-first-order rate law. The rate constant was calculated to be 0.0407 min \u22121 ( t 1/2 = 50 min) with Zn\u2013Ti LDH (Zn/Ti = 3:1) as the photocatalyst, much larger than that of TiO 2 , ZnO as well as P25. In order to give a further understanding of the high photocatalytic performance of the Zn\u2013Ti LDH, measurements of the optical properties were also performed. Fig. 6 shows the UV\u2013vis absorption spectra of Zn\u2013Ti LDH and other reference samples using the diffuse reflection method. A comparison of the corresponding absorption spectra between Zn\u2013Ti LDH and ZnO, TiO 2 and P25 clearly shows that the Zn\u2013Ti LDH exhibits enhanced absorption in the visible-light region (400\u2013700 nm). In addition, the absorbance of Zn\u2013Ti LDH in the region 200\u2013400 nm indicates the octahedral coordination of Ti atoms in the brucite-like sheets. It is well-known that light absorption by the material and the migration of the light-induced electrons and holes are the most key factors controlling a photocatalytic reaction, which is relevant to the electronic structure characteristics of the material [38] . Moreover, UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples was also used to determine the band gap ( Fig. 6 , inset), from which a band gap of \u223c3.06 eV for Zn\u2013Ti LDH was obtained. This value is smaller than that of P25 (\u223c3.19 eV), pure ZnO (\u223c3.21 eV) and TiO 2 (\u223c3.22 eV). The lower band gap of Zn\u2013Ti LDH in this work accounts for its high visible-light photocatalytic activity. In addition, the high photocatalytic activity of Zn\u2013Ti LDH is also attributed to its hierarchical structure and high specific surface (91.96\u2013107.88 m 2 g \u22121 ). The high specific surface area is responsible for providing strong adsorption ability toward target molecules and thus the generation of photoinduced electron\u2013hole pairs of active sites [39,40] . A wide distribution of macropores of Zn\u2013Ti LDH is favorable for the transportation and diffusion of species. The long-period performance of the Zn\u2013Ti LDH (Zn/Ti = 3:1) was also tested. As shown in Fig. S5 , the photocatalyst is stable under five repeated application cycles with nearly constant photodecomposition percentage, indicating that Zn\u2013Ti LDH does not deactivate during the photocatalytic process of the pollutant molecules. Moreover, this material can be easily separated from the reaction system due to the microscopic particle size of Zn\u2013Ti LDH. The results thus indicate that the Zn\u2013Ti LDH can be used as an attractive photocatalyst for large-scale environmental purification with high photocatalytic activity, long-term sustainability and excellent recyclability. 4 Conclusion In summary, the Zn\u2013Ti LDH was prepared with the method of co-precipitation, which displayed superior photocatalytic activity in the visible part of the solar spectrum for the degradation of MB compared with TiO 2 , ZnO as well as P25. The remarkable visible-light photocatalytic activity of Zn\u2013Ti LDH is attribute to its lower band gap (\u223c3.06 eV), hierarchical microsphere structure as well as high specific surface (91.96\u2013107.88 m 2 g \u22121 ). In addition, Zn\u2013Ti LDH retained its activity after several recycles of the MB photodegradation. Therefore, it is expected that the Zn\u2013Ti LDH with hierarchical structure in this work can be potentially used as an effective and recyclable visible-light photocatalyst for large-scale environmental purification.

        "abstract": "A novel fluorescent film based on 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonate/ layered double hydroxide composite (ANTS/LDH) has been synthesized by the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method, and its application as an optical sensor for Mg 2+ is demonstrated. The ANTS/LDH film with a thickness of 2 \u03bcm exhibits a good c-orientation of LDH platelets, which is confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The ANTS/LDH film shows a good fluorescent response for Mg 2+ ion. Meanwhile, a linear correlation between the fluorescence intensity of the ANTS/LDH film and the concentration of Mg 2+ is obtained (I = 0.496 + 0.0708 log c (Mg 2+), R 2 = 0.996), with a detection limit of 2.37 \u00d7 10 -7 M. The results indicate that ANTS/LDH film has a high fluorescence selectivity for Mg 2+ ions, with no significant response to other metal ions, including Ca 2+, Na +, K +, Fe 3+, Co 2+, Ni 2+, or Cu 2+. Furthermore, the ANTS/LDH thin film shows a good reusable ability for Mg 2+ by alternately changing the solution of Mg 2+ (5.0 \u00d7 10 -3 M) and EDTA (8.0 \u00d7 10 -2 M), and the relative standard deviation of 8 cycles is calculated as 1.7% (EDTA) and 0.14% (Mg 2+). The specific fluorescence response of the film sensor is attributed to the complexation between ANTS and Mg 2+, which is verified by 13C solid state NMR spectroscopy. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculation confirms that a strong interaction occurs between Mg 2+ and ANTS molecule, which is responsible for the significant fluorescence quenching of the ANTS/LDH film. The results indicate that the ANTS/LDH thin film in this work can be used as a chemsensor for the quantitative detection of Mg 2+. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "A ratiometric fluorescence sensor for Be(2+) has been fabricated via alternate assembly of 2-(3,6-disulfo-8-hydroxynaphthylazo)-1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene-3,6-disulfonate (Beryllon II) and MgAl-LDH nanosheets on quartz substrates using the layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition technique. UV-vis absorption and the fluorescence emission spectroscopy indicate a stepwise and regular growth of the Beryllon II/LDH UTFs upon increasing deposition cycle. The film of Beryllon II/LDH possesses a periodic layered structure perpendicular to the substrate revealed by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Atomic force microscopy images show that the film surface is continuous and uniform. The Beryllon II/LDH UTFs display ratiometric fluorescence response for Be(2+) with a linear response range in 1.0\u00d710(-7)-1.9\u00d710(-6) mol L(-1) and a detection limit of 4.2\u00d710(-9) mol L(-1). Furthermore, the ratiometric sensor exhibits good repeatability, high stability (thermal, storage and mechanical) as well as excellent selectivity toward Be(2+). XPS and Raman measurements demonstrate that the specific response of the sensor is attributed to the coordination between Be(2+) and Beryllon II in the UTF. The Beryllon II/LDH UTFs in this work can be potentially used as a chemosensor for the detection of Be(2+) in the environmental and biomedical field.",

To stabilize Li metal anode, preplanting Li nucleation seeds on lithiophilic substrates is an efficient strategy to regulate initial nucleation process of Li-metal. Herein, we first reported the activated ultrathin layered double hydroxide (U-LDHs) as a promising lithiophilic 2D material to realize the uniform deposition of Li metal. The experimental studies and DFT calculations reveal that the active oxygen on U-LDHs provides abundent atomic-scale active sites for Li homogeneous nucleation and plating. Moreover, the lithiophilic property of active oxygen is also related to its coordination environments. This work opens up an opportunity to more accurate regulation and understanding of Li nucleation from atomic-scale based on 2D ultrathin materials.",

The results show that the Run cluster prefers a 3D geometry when n \ufffd\ufffd 4 and that the Ru-TiO2 interface is predominantly composed of Ru-O and Ti-O bonds. Calculation studies based on the density of states (DOS), Hirshfeld charge analysis, and electron deformation density (EDD) demonstrate that the electronic interaction is mainly localized at the Ru-TiO2 interface through the electron transfer via the Ru-O bond. Additionally, the investigation on catalytic behavior of Ru n/TiO2 toward CO oxidation reveals the largely enhanced catalytic activity of the supported Run clusters, which originates from the significant reduction of the activation barrier as a result of the electron transfer from Ru to TiO2. ? 2014 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "We report the preparation of a reversible photoresponsive ultrathin film containing a photoactive azobenzene polymer poly{1-4[4-(3-carboxy-4-hydroxyphenylazo)benzenesulfonamido]-1,2-ethanediyl sodium salt} (PAZO) and exfoliated layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets using a layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly technique. Alternate irradiation with UV and visible light (lambda > 450 nm) results in a reversible switching between the trans isomer and the cis-rich photostationary state of the azobenzene group with concomitant significant changes in film color. Fluorescence polarization measurements indicated that the orientation of the azobenzene chromophores in the LDH matrix undergoes a reversible realignment during the photoisomerization processes. Photoisomerization induced by alternate UV and visible light irradiation was accompanied by reversible morphological changes of the LBL film, observable by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Molecular dynamics (MD) studies demonstrated that the LDH monolayers allow sufficient free space for the PAZO to undergo isomerization of its azobenzene chromophores. The reversible photoalignment of PAZO was also followed by MD simulations, and the results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental findings, further validating the configurational and orientational changes proposed for PAZO during the reversible photoprocess. It has been demonstrated that the host (LDH nanosheet)-guest (PAZO) interactions are key factors in determining the reversible photoresponsive performances of the film, since the comparative pristine PAZO film shows no such properties. Therefore, the incorporation of a photoactive moiety within the inorganic nanosheets of LDH by the LBL technique provides an attractive and feasible methodology for creating novel light-sensitive materials and devices with potential read-write capabilities.",

The materials M-MnO crystallize in the hexagonal system, the same structure as the precursor, with a larger interlamellar spacing. In the case of ZrO-MnO, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) determination indicates that the Zr atom locates between the MnO layers forming a stable structure. Compared with the precursor, the cycling property of M-MnO was improved distinctly, while the capacity decreased to some degree due to the strong interaction between pillars and the host matrix. Among these pillared materials, ZrO-MnO has an advanced reversible capacity of 161.5\u00a0mAh\u00b7g and improved cycling behavior compared with the precursor.",

        "abstract": "Overall water splitting through solar radiation is highly attractive for alternative energy utilization. Herein, we designed and fabricated a Cu2O@ZnCr-layered double hydroxide (LDH) core-shell photocatalyst to achieve a high-performance, visible-light overall water splitting. The Cu2O@ZnCr-LDH nanostructure exhibits a high activity (with H2 and O2 production rate of 0.90 and 0.44 \u03bcmol h\u22121, respectively) under visible-light without any sacrificial agent and co-catalyst, which is among the highest level of reported photocatalysts under the same conditions. Both experimental and computational investigations demonstrate that the Cu2O@ZnCr-LDH heterostructure fully exploits the synergistic effect of Cu2O and ZnCr-LDH, in terms of band structure matching. Most significantly, the S2O32\u2212 group in the gallery of ZnCr-LDH acts as an effective mediator between these two individual components, which not only inhibits the photocorrosion of Cu2O but also accelerates the immigration of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. Therefore, this work provides a deep insight for the design and preparation of visible-light-responsive photocatalysts, which show promising applications in photochemical reactions and energy conversion.",

        "abstract": "Intermetallic compounds (IMCs) have shown excellent catalytic performance toward the selective hydrogenation of acetylene, but the theoretical understanding on this reaction over Ni-based IMCs is rather limited. In this work, the adsorptions of the C species, Bader charge, projected density of states (PDOS) and the reaction pathways were calculated by the density functional theory (DFT) method to investigate the mechanism and selectivity for the acetylene hydrogenation on the (111) surface of NiGa (n = 1, 3) IMCs, with a comparative study on the pristine Ni(111) surface. The results indicate that the adsorption energy of acetylene increased along with the Ni/Ga ratio, therefore a feasible acetylene adsorption on the Ga-rich surface guaranteed a low effective barrier, leading to the best activity for the NiGa(111) surface among three surfaces. Bader charge analysis shows that electrons transferred from Ga atoms to Ni atoms and further delivered to C species, decreasing the adsorption capacity of C species on NiGa(111) in comparison with those on Ni(111) and NiGa(111). The reaction pathway of acetylene hydrogenation to ethylene via vinyl or even over-hydrogenation to ethane via ethyl is more favorable than the pathway involving the ethylidene intermediate on all surfaces. Moreover, the ethylene selectivity has a positive correlation with the gallium content by comparing the desorption barrier with the hydrogenation barrier of ethylene, thus the NiGa(111) surface also exhibits the best selectivity. Therefore, the NiGa(111) surface demonstrates to be an excellent reaction facet for the semihydrogenation of acetylene, which agreed with the experimental findings, and would provide helpful instructions for designing and preparing highly-selective and noble-substitute catalysts of alkyne semihydrogenation.",

        "title": "Insights into Interfacial Synergistic Catalysis over Ni@TiO 2- x Catalyst toward Water-Gas Shift Reaction.",
        "abstract": "The mechanism on interfacial synergistic catalysis for supported metal catalysts has long been explored and investigated in several important heterogeneous catalytic processes (e.g., water-gas shift (WGS) reaction). The modulation of metal-support interactions imposes a substantial influence on activity and selectivity of catalytic reaction, as a result of the geometric/electronic structure of interfacial sites. Although great efforts have validated the key role of interfacial sites in WGS over metal catalysts supported on reducible oxides, direct evidence at the atomic level is lacking and the mechanism of interfacial synergistic catalysis is still ambiguous. Herein, Ni nanoparticles supported on TiO2-x (denoted as Ni@TiO2-x) was fabricated via a structure topotactic transformation of NiTi-layered double hydroxide (NiTi-LDHs) precursor, which showed excellent catalytic performance for WGS reaction. In situ microscopy was carried out to reveal the partial encapsulation structure of Ni@TiO2-x catalyst. A combination study including in situ and operando EXAFS, in situ DRIFTS spectra combined with TPSR measurements substantiates a new redox mechanism based on interfacial synergistic catalysis. Notably, interfacial Ni species (electron-enriched Ni\u03b4- site) participates in the dissociation of H2O molecule to generate H2, accompanied with the oxidation of Ni\u03b4--Ov-Ti3+ (Ov: oxygen vacancy) to Ni\u03b4+-O-Ti4+ structure. DFT calculations further verify that the interfacial sites of Ni@TiO2-x catalyst serve as the optimal active site with the lowest activation energy barrier (\uf07e0.35 eV) for water dissociation. This work provides a fundamental understanding on interfacial synergistic catalysis toward WGS reaction, which is constructive for the rational design and fabrication of high activity heterogeneous catalysts.",

        "abstract": "The intercalation of the anions of diclofenac (Dic), naproxen (Nap), and valproic acid (Val) into three hydroxy double salts (HDSs) has been explored in this work. Experiments were performed with [Co1.2Zn3.8(OH)8](NO3)2\u00b72H2O (CoZn-NO3), [Ni2Zn3(OH)8](NO3)2\u00b72H2O (NiZn-NO3) and [Zn5(OH)8](NO3)2\u00b72H2O (Zn-NO3). It proved possible to intercalate diclofenac and naproxen into all three HDSs. In contrast, Val could be intercalated into CoZn-NO3 but when it was reacted with Zn-NO3 the HDS structure was destroyed, and the product comprised ZnO. Successful intercalation was verified by X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy, and elemental microanalysis. Molecular dynamics simulations showed the Dic and Nap ions to arrange themselves in an \u201cX\u201d shape in the interlayer space, forming a bilayer. Val was found to adopt a position with its aliphatic groups parallel to the HDS layer, again in a bilayer. In situ time resolved X-ray diffraction experiments revealed that intercalation of Dic and Nap into CoZn-NO3 and Zn-NO3 is mechanistically complex, with a number of intermediate phases observed. In contrast, the intercalation of all three guests into NiZn-NO3 and of Val into CoZn-NO3 are simple one step reactions proceeding directly from the starting material to the product. The HDS-drug composites were found to have sustained release profiles.",

Due to the thermodynamic stability of CO2, developing highly efficient and cost-effective catalysts is the main challenge with respect to large scale production. CeO2-based materials have aroused increasing research interest as supports or catalysts toward CO2 conversion. By virtue of the unique structural properties resulting from oxygen vacancies and reversible valence change (Ce4+ and Ce3+), CeO2 exhibits great potential as a support to immobilize catalytically-active species or even as an active site to activate the oxygen-containing bond in catalytic reactions involving CO2. In this review, the latest advances in the design, preparation and application of CeO2-based heterogeneous catalysts toward CO2 conversion are summarized.",

Structural characterizations based on SEM and BET display their slice morphology with average thickness of 5.2 nm and a large specific surface area of 244.3 m2 g\u22121. This gives rise to excellent catalytic performance toward phenol hydroxylation (conversion: 45.6%; selectivity: 97.3%). Especially, the normalized activity value is as high as 330.8 (mol phenol/mol Cu2+) with the efficiency of peroxide up to 91.1%. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest value for Cu-based heterogeneous catalysts in this reaction. This work demonstrates the unique structural feature of CuMgAl-LDH@mSiO2 nanosheets with efficient exposure of active sites and its remarkably enhanced catalytic activity toward phenol hydroxylation.",

Herein, we fabricated a series of Cu2O@ZnCr-layered double hydroxide (LDH) photocatalysts with tunable interfacial properties, by precise regulation over a covalent-bonding-bridge structure at the heterointerface. The Cu2O@ZnCr-LDH photocatalyst with an optimized interface exhibits a stoichiometric production of H2 and O2 with a generation rate of 3.42 and 1.63 \u03bcmol h\u22121, respectively, without any sacrificial agents or co-catalysts. This activity is among the highest reported for photocatalysts under the same conditions. By using extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and coincidence Doppler broadening positron annihilation spectroscopy (CDB-PAS), for the first time, we substantiated that a bridge-type bonding at the heterointerface strongly facilitates the interfacial transportation of photo-induced carriers via a Z-scheme route. This provides direct experimental evidence for carrier interfacial transportation, beyond previously reported theoretical predictions and simulations. It is expected that this modulation and optimization over the heterostructure interface can be extended to other dual-semiconductor photocatalysts with high performance.",

        "abstract": "In a number of heterogeneous catalysis processes, the promotion effect toward active sites is of vital importance and remains a challenge to obtain largely-improved catalytic performance. Herein, rehydrated Ca4MnxAl-layered double hydroxides (denoted as re-Ca4MnxAl-LDH) were prepared based on a structure memory effect of LDH precursors, which exhibited extremely high heterogeneous catalytic performance for the aldol condensation reaction, with the assistance of the promotion effect of Mn. A combination study including XRD, EXAFS, XPS, CDCl3-FTIR and DFT calculations confirms that re-Ca4MnxAl-LDH samples with Ca\u2013O\u2013MnIV structure show a highly-exposed Ca2+ s-orbital and strengthened coordination between Ca2+ with 7-fold OH\u2212, providing a weakened Bronsted basic site compared with the reference sample re-Ca4Al-LDH. The optimized re-Ca4Mn0.5Al-LDH catalyst exhibits prominent catalytic performance toward the condensation of isobutyraldehyde (IBD) and formaldehyde (FA) to produce hydroxypivaldehyde (HPA), with a HPA yield of 70.3%. This is significantly higher than re-Ca4Al-LDHs (63.3%) and even comparable to the level of liquid alkali catalysts (73.2%). Studies on the structure\u2013property correlation reveal that the weakened basic site originating from Ca\u2013O\u2013MnIV serves as a promoted active center, which accelerates the product desorption and thus largely improves HPA selectivity. This promoted re-Ca4Mn0.5Al-LDH catalyst can be potentially applied as a promising candidate in heterogeneous aldol condensation reactions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Solid basic catalysts are extremely desirable in green catalytic processes, due to their advantages of facile separation, negligible corrosion and environmental friendliness. Great progress has been made in solid basic catalysts in the last decade, which have been widely used in the synthesis of organics and fine chemicals as well as environmental catalysis. Development of solid basic catalysts is therefore of significant importance both in academic area and industrial application. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of solid basic catalysts in several based-catalyzed organic reactions. The first part introduces history and significant application in chemical industry of heterogeneous basic catalysis. The second part overviews numerous solid basic catalysts classified by the type of basic sites toward fine chemicals synthesis; furthermore, the relationship between basic site structure ( e.g.,  strength, concentration, geometric and electronic structure) and catalytic performance is also emphasized in this section. In the final section, current challenges and future strategies in field of solid basic catalysts are discussed from the viewpoint of material design, structure\u2013property correlation and practical applications in heterogeneous catalysis processes.",

EXAFS, in situ CO-FTIR and DFT calculation results reveal that the introduction of Sn in Co\u2013Sn IMCs dramatically optimizes the geometric and electronic structures of active Co, in which Sn isolates the Co active-site and electron transfer occurs from Sn to the Co atom. H2-TPD measurements indicate the presence of four different Co sites (labeled as \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03c3) on the surface of these IMCs; the sample of CoSn IMC shows the largest \u03b2/(\u03b3 + \u03c3) ratio, which results in the highest selectivity toward unsaturated alcohols (SUA: 67.6%). DFT studies prove that the geometric and electronic effects of the CoSn IMC weaken the hydrogenation of the CC group, accounting for the largely enhanced hydrogenation selectivity of citral to unsaturated alcohols.",

        "abstract": "The selective hydrogenation of benzene is one promising route to obtain cyclohexene, a key intermediate for the production of various value-added fine chemicals. Herein, we report the preparation of a novel Ru/TiO2 catalyst encapsulated by a porous TiO2 coating (denoted as (Ru/TiO2)@p-TiO2) for this reaction, in which the supported Ru particles serve as active sites for hydrogen dissociation while the porous TiO2 surface acts as the active center for benzene hydrogenation. By virtue of the shielding effect of the porous TiO2 layer with a suitable pore size, only hydrogen molecules can diffuse into the interior Ru surface for dissociation adsorption, followed by hydrogen spillover from Ru to the porous TiO2 surface and subsequent hydrogenation of adsorbed benzene there. Cyclohexene temperature programmed desorption (CHE-TPD) and DFT calculations demonstrate that cyclohexene shows a more beneficial desorption and a much higher activation energy for its further hydrogenation over the TiO2 surface in comparison with the Ru surface, accounting for the largely enhanced catalytic performance (benzene conversion: 98.1%, cyclohexene selectivity: 76.6%). This double-active-site synergistic catalysis, to the best of our knowledge, gives the highest cyclohexene yield ever reported.",

        "abstract": "In heterogeneous catalysis processes, development of high-performance acid\u2013base sites synergistic catalysis has drawn increasing attention. In this work, we prepared Mg/Zr/Al mixed metal oxides (denoted as Mg2ZrxAl1\u2212x\u2013MMO) derived from Mg\u2013Zr\u2013Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs) precursors. Their catalytic performance toward the synthesis of diethyl carbonate (DEC) from urea and ethanol was studied in detail, and the highest catalytic activity was obtained over the Mg2Zr0.53Al0.47MMO catalyst (DEC yield: 37.6%). By establishing correlation between the catalytic performance and Lewis acid\u2013base sites measured by NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD, it is found that both weak acid site and medium strength base site contribute to the overall yield of DEC, which demonstrates an acid\u2013base synergistic catalysis in this reaction. In addition, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (in situ FTIR) measurements reveal that the Lewis base site activates ethanol to give ethoxide species; while Lewis acid site facilitates the activated adsorption of urea and the intermediate ethyl carbamate (EC). Therefore, this work provides an effective method for the preparation of tunable acid\u2013base catalysts based on LDHs precursor approach, which can be potentially used in cooperative acid\u2013base catalysis reaction.",

        "abstract": "Oxidant-free dehydrogenation of alcohols has attracted considerable attention, owing to the largely improved utility value of alcohols. Herein, mixed metal oxides (MMOs) via topological transformation of Mg\u2013Al hydrotalcite precursors were prepared and used as support for the immobilization of metallic Ag nanoparticles. The resulting Ag/MgAl-MMO shows an excellent catalytic performance toward oxidant-free dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol (conversion of benzyl alcohol: 95.9%; selectivity of benzaldehyde: 93.3%), which is close to platinum-group catalysts commonly used in this reaction. A combination study based on a series of characterization methods reveals a synergistic catalysis between Ag\u03b4+ and medium-strong acid/basic sites (Mg\u03b4+\u2013O\u03b4\u2212) from support: Ag\u03b4+ facilitates the breakage of \u03b1-C\u2013H bond while Mg\u03b4+\u2013O\u03b4\u2212 accelerates the cleavage of O\u2013H bond. This work provides an effective approach to enhance catalytic behavior toward dehydrogenation reactions by virtue of metal\u2013support interactions.",

        "abstract": "Selective hydrogenation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds plays a key role in the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical agents. In this work, two kinds of intermetallic compounds (IMCs: CoIn3 and CoGa3) were prepared via structural topotactic transformation from layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors, which exhibited surprisingly high catalytic activity and selectivity toward hydrogenation reaction of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes (C\u2550O vs C\u2550C). Notably, the CoGa3 catalyst shows a hydrogenation selectivity of 96% from cinnamaldehyde (CAL) to cinnamyl alcohol (COL), significantly higher than CoIn3 (80%) and monometallic Co catalyst (42%). A combination study including XANES, XPS, and CO-IR spectra verifies electron transfer from Ga (or In) to Co, leading to the formation of Co\u2014Ga (or Co\u2014In) coordination.

Herein, two heterogonous Ni catalysts supported on mixed metal oxides (MMO) were prepared via structural topological transformation from hydrotalcites (LDHs) precursors with carbonate or nitrate in interlayer region (denoted as Ni/MMO-CO3 and Ni/MMO-NO3), which were featured by highly-exposed Ni(111) facet as well as multi-facets with abundant steps/vacancies, respectively. Interestingly, the selectivity of furfural hydrogenation can be switched by using these two catalysts: Ni/MMO-NO3 exhibits a high selectivity (97%) to furfural alcohol (FOL) (hydrogenation product of C=O bond); whereas Ni/MMO-CO3 shows an exclusive selectivity (99%) toward tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFOL, hydrogenation product of both C=O and furan ring).

        "abstract": "Abstract   Ethanol conversion to high-value-added products has attracted considerable attention in both academic research and industrial fields. In this study, we synthesized a series of tunable acid\u2013base bifunctional Zn-Zr-Al metal oxides (represented as Zn 2 Zr  x  Al-MMO) in light of the structural topotactic transformation of Zn 2 Zr  x  Al-hydrotalcite precursors (Zn 2 Zr  x  Al-LDH). The resulting Zn 2 Zr  x  Al-MMO catalysts were employed in the conversion of ethanol to diethyl carbonate. The Zr 4+  ion content of the LDH precursor plays a key role in modulating the acid-base properties and determining catalytic performance: the Zn 2 Zr 0.1 Al-MMO sample exhibits the optimal catalytic behavior with a diethyl carbonate (DEC) yield of 42.1%, which is the highest reported for metal oxide catalysts. Structure-property correlation investigations revealed that the synergic catalysis between medium-strong basic sites and weak acid sites plays a predominant role in the catalytic behavior. Furthermore,  in situ  Fourier transform infrared measurements showed that the weak acidic site promotes activation adsorption of the reactant (urea) and the intermediate product (ethyl carbamate), while the medium-strong basic site accelerates ethanol activation. Moreover, the Zn 2 Zr 0.1 Al-MMO catalyst has the advantages of cost effectiveness, good stability, and reusability. Therefore, the acid-base bifunctional catalysts developed in this work can be employed as promising candidates in acid-base catalytic reactions such as ethanol conversion.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   C1 chemistry is the essence of coal chemistry and natural gas chemistry. Catalytic methods to efficiently convert C1 molecules into fuels and chemicals have been extensively studied. Syngas (CO + H 2 ) conversion is the most important industrial reaction system in C1 chemistry, and Fe and Co catalysts, two major industrial catalysts, have been the focus of fundamental research and industrial application. In the last decade, considerable research efforts have been devoted to discoveries concerning catalyst structure and increasing market demands for olefins and oxygenates. Since the development of efficient catalysts would strongly benefit from catalyst design and the establishment of a new reaction system, this review comprehensively overviews syngas conversion in three main reactions, highlights the advances recently made and the challenges that remain open, and will stimulate future research activities. The first part of the review summarizes the breakthroughs in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis regarding the optimization of activity and stability, determination of the active phase, and mechanistic studies. The second part overviews the modulation of catalytic structure and product selectivity for Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTO). Catalysts designed to produce higher alcohols, as well as to tune product selectivity in C1 chemistry, are described in the third section. Finally, present challenges in syngas conversion are proposed, and the solutions and prospects are discussed from the viewpoint of fundamental research and practical application. This review summarizes the latest advances in the design, preparation, and application of Fe/Co-based catalysts toward syngas conversion and presents the challenges and future directions in producing value-added fuels.",

The concentration of Ni active site and acid\u2013base sites can be simultaneously enhanced by precisely tuning the in situ structural topotactic transformation parameters of LDH precursor as revealed by CO pulse chemisorption, CO2-TPD, and NH3-TPD, so as to achieve a promoted synergic catalysis between metal Ni and acid\u2013base sites. The resul...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Metal-support synergistic catalysis plays a crucial role in heterogeneous reaction processes from viewpoint of both fundamental research and practical applications. Herein, a series of Cu-based nanocatalysts were prepared by virtue of topotactic structure transformation from CuMgAl-layered double hydroxide (CuMgAl\u2009\u2212\u2009LDH) precursors. Various  in situ  investigations including XRD, XPS, EXAFS and FTIR demonstrate that the structural transformation of CuMgAl\u2009\u2212\u2009LDH results in well-dispersed Cu nanoparticles (metallic Cu\u00b0 as the single species) supported on mixed metal oxides (MgO and Al 2 O 3 , denoted as Cu/MMO). The optimal catalyst (Cu/MMO\u2212S3) exhibits an excellent catalytic performance toward hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate (DMO) to ethylene glycol (EG) (yield: 94.4%) at an exceptionally low operation temperature (438\u2009K). This is, to the best of our knowledge, at least 30\u201540\u2009K lower than normally accepted temperature for Cu-based catalysts (above 473\u2009K). Structure\u2009\u2212\u2009property correlation investigations were performed  via in situ  FTIR, N 2 O pulse chemisorption, NH 3 \u2212TPD and CO 2 \u2212TPD, and the results revealed that a ternary synergistic catalysis of Cu and acid\u2009\u2212\u2009base sites makes a predominant contribution: Lewis acid sites (Al 3+ ) and medium-strong basic sites (Mg 2+ \u2212O 2\u2212  pair) of supports serve as active sites for adsorption of polarized C O/C O group in DMO molecule; while H 2  undergoes dissociation adsorption on Cu\u00b0 site. This precise control over metal and acid\u2009\u2212\u2009base sites based on LDHs precursor approach would lead to new possibilities in rational design and preparation of heterogeneous catalysts for hydrogenation of C O/C O group.",

The selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene over these metal phosphides was evaluated, and the as-prepared Ni2P/Al2O3 catalyst shows a much higher selectivity to styrene (up to 88.2%) than Ni12P5/Al2O3 (48.0%), NiP2/Al2O3 (65.9%), and Ni/Al2O3 (0.7%) catalysts. EXAFS and in situ IR measurements reveal that the incorporation of P increases the bond length of Ni\u2013Ni, which imposes a key influence on the adsorption state of alkene intermediates: as the Ni\u2013Ni bond length extends to 0.264 nm, the alkene intermediate undergoes di-\u03c0(C\u2550C) adsorption, facilitating its desorption and the resulting enhanced selectivity. Moreover, electron transfer occurs from Ni to P, as confirmed...",

        "abstract": "For catalytic processes involving multiple reaction pathways such as the ethanol steam reforming (ESR), tailoring the active site structure of catalysts to achieve the desired catalytic selectivity is of vital importance and remains a challenge. Here, we report a heterogeneous Ru\u2013Ni catalyst by anchoring Ru clusters onto the defect sites of Ni nanoparticles. The resulting strained Ru\u2013Ni interface shows a high activity toward the C\u2013C bond cleavage that is essentially required for hydrogen production via ESR. The C\u2013O bond rupture in the side reaction (methanation) is significantly inhibited. This results in an extremely high H2 yield of 4.2 molH2/molEtOH at 350 \u00b0C, superior to the previously reported ESR catalysts working at medium-low temperature (300\u2013500 \u00b0C). An experimental-computational combination study verifies that the conversion of Ni surface defects to the Ru\u2013Ni interface plays a decisive role in the remarkably improved H2 yield.

        "abstract": "Flexible and lightweight wire-shaped supercapacitors (WSSCs) have recently attracted increasing interest, due to their versatility in the device design and application potentials in portable or wearable electronics. However, practical applications of WSSCs are still limited by the relatively poor performances, owing to the challenges in the rational modification of one-dimensional (1D) substrates with sophisticated nanostructure. Herein, we demonstrate a WSSC by virtue of material exploration and fabrication strategy. A 1D nanoarray electrode consisting of CuO nonowires core and CoFe-layered double hydroxide (CoFe-LDH) nanoplatelets shell supported on a copper wire is prepared with fine control over the structure/morphology, which displays a largely improved specific capacitance, high rate capability and long cycling lifespans. Based on this sophisticated core\u2013shell nanostructure, a flexible all-solid-state asymmetric WSSC was fabricated, which exhibits excellent supercapacitive performances with a high energy density (1.857 mWh cm\u22123) and long-term cycling stability (99.5% device capacitance retention over 2000 cycles).By virtue of the versatility of metal wire substrates, transition metal oxides and LDHs materials, the synthesis strategy presented here can be extended to the fabrication of other portable and flexible micro energy storage devices.",

Ultrathin MFe-LDH nanoplatelets (200-300 nm in lateral length; 8-12 nm in thickness) perpendicular to the substrate surface are directly prepared within hundreds of seconds (<300 s) under cathodic potential. The as-obtained NiFe-LDH nanoplatelet arrays display promising behavior in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), giving rise to a rather low overpotential (0.224 V) at 10.0 mA cm with largely enhanced stability, much superior to previously reported electro-oxidation catalysts as well as the state-of-the-art Ir/C catalyst. Furthermore, the MFe-LDH nanoplatelet arrays can also efficiently catalyze several other fuel molecules' oxidation (, hydrazine, methanol and ethanol), delivering a satisfactory electrocatalytic activity and a high operation stability. In particular, this preparation method of Fe-containing LDHs is amenable to fast, effective and large-scale production, and shows promising applications in water splitting, fuel cells and other clean energy devices.",

Despite tremendous efforts, the development of ORR electrocatalysts with high activity and low cost remains a great challenge. Here, we report the fabrication of well-defined carbon network with honeycomb-like structure as a high-performance catalyst toward ORR, via pyrolysis of bimetallic Co, Zn-zeolitic imidazolate (Co, Zn-ZIF) crystal arrays grown on the surface of layered double hydroxide nanoplatelets (LDHs@Co, Zn-ZIF). The concentration of doped-heteroatoms (N, Co), the graphitic degree as well as the surface porosity of the resulting carbon network can be finely controlled by tuning the Co/Zn molar ratio in the LDHs@Co, Zn-ZIF precursors. The optimal carbon catalyst (CoZn-2) exhibits excellent ORR activity with an onset potential of 0.976 V vs. RHE and a limited current density of 5.8 mA cm\u22122, which is superior to commercial Pt/C catalyst. In addition, both an extraordinary long-term stability (\u223c99.5% current retention over 20,000 s) and a strong tolerance against methanol corrosion are also obtained. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to artificially regulate the nanostructure and intrinsic active site of carbon-based ORR electrocatalysts.",

However, the widely application of FSSCs has been limited by relatively deficient of the electrode materials, such as low electrical conductivity and modest reaction kinetics, which limit the practical energy output and stability. Herein, we introduce the design and fabrication of a sophisticated FSSCs device which consists of conducting carbon materials modified transition metal oxides/hydroxides nanorod arrays (NRAs). The well-defined carbon conducting layer was rationally introduced on the micro NRAs substrate by using metal-organic framework (MOF) as precursor, which was epitaxial grown on the surface of ZnO NRAs. Subsequently, the as-synthesized ZnO@MOF core-shell NRAs were transformed to the well-uniformed ZnO@C@CoNi-layered double hydroxide (LDH) and Fe2O3@C core-shell NRAs through in situ electrodeposition and cation exchange strategy, respectively. Furthermore, an asymmetric ZnO@C@CoNi-LDH//Fe2O3@C FSSC device was constructed with a high energy density (1.078 mW h cm\u20133), power density (0.4 W cm\u20133) as well as outstanding cycling lifespans (retention 95.01% after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles), which is superior to majority asymmetric FSSCs.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have shown promising performance in electrocatalytic water splitting. However, the sluggish kinetic of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process deteriorates their activity toward overall water splitting. To overcome this issue, two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin arrays of metal-doped CoP (MCoP; M = Fe, Ni, and Mg) were successfully prepared by using layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as precursors. The as-obtained 2D ultrathin arrays exhibit an outstanding electrocatalytic activity and long-term durability toward both half-reaction in overall water splitting. As a result, the electrolyzer assembled by FeCoP UNSAs consumes a cell potential as low as 1.60 V (at 10 mA cm\u22122). An experimental-theoretical combination study reveals that the electronic structure of Co is modulated via the incorporation of Fe, which benefits the adsorption of water molecule and the dissociation of OH group, accounting for the largely enhanced activity toward overall water splitting.",

Here we report the design and fabrication of free-standing nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (NCNT) arrays via a directed growth approach as a high-performance bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst. By virtue of the unique hierarchical nanoarray structure, uniform N-doping and decreased charge-transfer resistance, the as-prepared NCNT array exhibits rather high activity and stability in both ORR and OER, even superior to the mono-functional commercial Pt/C (for ORR) and IrO2 (for OER). A flexible, rechargeable all-solid-state zinc\u2013air battery is successfully fabricated by using this self-supporting NCNT electrode as air-cathode, which gives excellent discharge-charge performance and mechanical stability.",

In this work, well-aligned, hierarchical zinc-iron layered double hydroxide (LDH) is in situ synthesized on the surface of TiO2 by a facile and effective photo-assisted electrodeposition (PED) method. An experimental-computational combination study reveals that the photogenerated holes of TiO2 tend to travel to ZnFe-LDH which enhances the bulk charge separation; while ZnFe-LDH acts as a cocatalyst which accelerates the surface water oxidation reaction. The resulting TiO2/ZnFe-LDH-PE photoanode exhibits a largely enhanced PEC performance: the photocurrent density at 1.0 V vs. RHE is 2.29 and 1.31 times higher than that of the pristine TiO2 and TiO2/ZnFe-LDH-E (prepared by a conventional electrosynthesis method) photoanode, with 150 mV and 50 mV of negative shift for onset potential. This can be ascribed to the enhanced interface interaction and highly-matched band structure between ZnFe-LDH and TiO2. It is expected that this strategy can be extended to other heterostructures for advanced performance in the fields of energy conversion and storage.",

Different from traditional catalysis or photocatalytic process, here we report an effective photoelectrochemical (PEC) approach for selective anaerobic oxidation of alcohols accompanied with H production by means of solar energy. By using TiO nanowires modified with graphitic carbon layer as photoanode, benzyl alcohol (BA) has been oxidized to benzaldehyde with high efficiency and selectivity (>99\u2009%) in aqueous media at room temperature, superior to individual electrocatalytic or photocatalytic processes. Moreover, this PEC synthesis method can be effectively extended to the oxidation of several other aryl alcohols to their corresponding aldehydes under mild conditions. The electron spin resonance (ESR) results indicate the formation of intermediate active oxygen (O ) on the photoanode, which further reacts with alcohols to produce final aldehyde compounds.",

Benefiting from the unique architecture, NiFe-LDH HMS shows highly efficient OER electrocatalytic activity with a preferable current density (71.69 mA cm at \u03b7 = 300 mV) and a small onset overpotential (239 mV at 10 mA cm), which outperforms the 20 wt % commercial Ir/C catalyst.

However, the slow interfacial kinetics and fast charge recombination are the major obstacles which limit the performance of LDH-based photocatalysts. Here, we demonstrate the doping of rare earth ions into the host layer of LDHs to inhibit the charge recombination and increase the charge injection efficiency simultaneously. A series of terbium ion (Tb3+) doped ZnCr\u2013LDHs (Tb-ZnCr\u2013LDHs) have been successfully synthesized via a co-precipitation method, and their photocatalytic water splitting activities were evaluated under visible light irradiation. The sample with a Tb3+ doping content of 0.5% (molar ratio) shows optimal performance for oxygen evolution (1022 \u03bcmol h\u22121 g\u22121) among all these Tb-ZnCr\u2013LDH materials. The photoluminescence and photoelectrochemistry measurements over the Tb-ZnCr\u2013LDH samples prove effective separation of photo-induced charge carriers and high charge injection efficiency, compared with a pristine ZnCr\u2013LDH.

        "abstract": "The ever-increasing demand for renewable and clean power sources has triggered the development of novel materials for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, but how to improve the solar conversion efficiency remains a big challenge. In this work, we report a conceptual strategy in a ternary material system to simultaneously enhance the charge separation and water oxidation efficiency of photoanodes by introducing reduced graphite oxide (rGO) and NiFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) on TiO2 nanorod arrays (NAs). An experimental\u2013computational combination study reveals that rGO with a high work function and superior electron mobility accepts photogenerated electrons from TiO2 and enables fast electron transportation; while NiFe-LDH acts as a cocatalyst which accelerates the surface water oxidation reaction. This synergistic effect in this ternary TiO2/rGO/NiFe-LDH photoanode gives rise to a largely enhanced photoconversion efficiency (0.58% at 0.13 V) and photocurrent density (1.74 mA cm\u22122 at 0.6 V). It is worth mentioning that the photocurrent density of TiO2/rGO/NiFe-LDH, to the best of our knowledge, is superior to previously reported TiO2-based photoanodes in benign and neutral media. In addition, the method presented here can be extended to the preparation of other efficient photoanodes (WO3/rGO/NiFe-LDH and \u03b1-Fe2O3/rGO/NiFe-LDH) toward high level PEC performance.",

        "abstract": "How to develop cost-effective electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the critical issues in renewable energy storage and conversion technology. Here, we report the preparation of well-ordered ultrathin film (UTF) electrodes based on layered double hydroxide nanosheets (LDH NSs) and iron porphyrin (Fe-PP) through an electrostatic layer-by-layer (LBL) technique, which show excellent OER performance. By virtue of the high catalytic activity of LDH NSs and good electron-transfer ability of Fe-PP, the resulting CoNi-LDH NS/Fe-PP UTF exhibits a remarkably low overpotential (264 mV) to attain an OER current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 and a substantially decreased Tafel slope of 37.6 mV dec\u22121, much superior to that of the IrO2 catalyst. Moreover, this method can be extended to the preparation of other UTFs based on LDHs and Fe-PP (e.g., CoMn-LDH NS/Fe-PP, CoFe-LDH NS/Fe-PP and ZnCo-LDH NS/Fe-PP) with significantly enhanced OER performance relative to pristine LDH NSs. To illustrate the advantage of these UTFs in practical water splitting, a prototype electrolyzer cell is also fabricated by using the (CoNi-LDH/Fe-PP)30 UTF as the anode and Pt wire as the cathode, which achieves the production of both oxygen and hydrogen by using a 1.5 V AA battery as the power source.",

        "abstract": "Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation has received considerable attention owing to its key role in the overall water splitting. In this work, several reduced titania@layered double hydroxide (CoAl\u2013LDH, CoCr\u2013LDH, and CoFe\u2013LDH) hybrid photoanodes were fabricated via electrochemical deposition of LDH on the reduced titania, and their PEC properties for water oxidation were studied systematically. The reduced titania@CoCr\u2013LDH photoanode shows a much improved PEC performance compared with pristine reduced titania, with a photocurrent density enhancement of 43% (from 0.65 mA cm\u22122 to 0.93 mA cm\u22122) and an onset potential decrease of 21% (from 0.23 V to 0.18 V vs. the RHE). This improvement is also successfully demonstrated in the reduced titania@CoAl\u2013LDH and reduced titania@CoFe\u2013LDH system. The photoconversion efficiency of reduced titania is significantly enhanced after the incorporation of LDH (0.42\u20130.51% at \u223c0.46 V vs. the RHE). Both the experimental studies and DFT calculations confirm a synergistic effect between the reduced titania and LDH. The results show that a good match of the band structure facilitates the fast electron\u2013hole separation and the migration of holes from reduced titania to LDH, followed by the LDH catalyzed water oxidation. The CoCr\u2013LDH has the highest driving force for oxygen evolution among these LDHs, accounting for the optimal PEC performance of the reduced titania@CoCr\u2013LDH photoanode.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Developing safe and efficient lithium (Li)-metal anode is promising for the next-generation rechargeable batteries, such as Li\u2013S and Li\u2013O 2  batteries. The design of lithium plating host with unique nanostructure and lithiophilic surface has been proven to be one of the most efficient strategies to control Li plating/stripping process and inhibit lithium dendrite growth. Here we first report the fabrication of well-defined oxygen-rich carbon nanotube (O-CNT) network via a facile and scalable ultrafast \u201cbarbecue\u201d approach. Remarkably, the as-obtained three-dimensional (3D) O-CNT network electrode can serve as a promising Li-metal host with a low Li deposition overpotential and a flat voltage profile at various current densities, as well as long-term durability. The DFT calculation and experimental results further prove that the ketonic (C=O) group on CNT surface acts as efficient lithiophilic site to guide Li-metal nucleation and growth. In addition, the 3D porous network structure of O-CNT network with high conductivity facilitates electron and Li ions transport. Thus, this work provides a new strategy to construct high-performed Li-metal anodes toward high-performance Li-based batteries.",

The as-obtained NCNTs exhibit excellent performance in electrocatalytic oxygen reduction with an onset potential of 0.95 V vs. RHE, a diffusion-limited current of 6.82 mA cm\u22122 and excellent stability in alkaline media, much superior to that of reported CNT-based ORR catalysts as well as commercial Pt/C. Moreover, the ratio of different nitrogens (pyridinic, pyrrolic and graphitic N) can be tuned easily by changing the coating amount of PPy in the CNTs@PPy core\u2013shell precursors; and the results indicate that the pyridinic-N in the CNTs@PPy derived NCNTs plays a key role in promoting the ORR performances.",

        "abstract": "To achieve highly efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, great efforts have been dedicated to develop various photoelectrode materials in pure water electrolytes. Recently, some studies are turning to hydrogen production from seawater or wastewater, to save valuable freshwater resources and make waste profitable. Here, we fabricate one-dimensional SnO2@BiVO4 core\u2013shell nanorod arrays decorated with cobalt-phosphate cocatalyst (1D SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi NRAs), which show efficient charge separation and transport properties due to the rational design of conducting core-layer and introduction of the cocatalyst. The as-obtained SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanodes exhibit largely enhanced PEC water oxidation performance: the maximum photocurrent density of 2.63 mA cm\u22122 at 1.23 V vs. RHE is 6.58 times higher than that of pristine BiVO4 films (\u223c0.40 mA cm\u22122). Moreover, the ternary photoanode exhibits promising PEC performance for urea oxidation, giving rise to a current density of 3.44 mA cm\u22122 at 1.23 V vs. RHE in a neutral urea electrolyte. This work presents a sunlight-driven, eco-friendly and sustainable method to produce hydrogen and simultaneously treat urea-rich wastewater.",

Here we report a facile and effective method to largely enhance the transfer ability of charge carriers  via  fabrication of an oxygen vacancy-rich WO  x   modulated WO 3  photoanode (WO 3 -OV). Experimental studies show that the oxygen vacancies significantly increase the charge carrier density of WO 3 -OV (\u223c6.89 times larger than that of pristine WO 3 ). Moreover, density functional theory calculations reveal that a WO 3 /WO  x   heterojunction is formed due to the energy difference between WO 3  and oxygen vacancy-rich layer, which improves the build-in electronic field and reduces the charge recombination. As a result, the WO 3 -OV photoanode gives largely improved charge separation efficiency (67.2%) and a high photocurrent density of 1.35\u202fmA\u202fcm \u22122 \u202fat 1.23\u202fV  vs.  RHE, among the highest level in WO 3 -based materials. It is expected that the surface modulation by oxygen vacancy can be extended to other semiconductor systems for advanced performance in the fields of energy conversion and storage.",

The patient underwent immediate coronary angiography, which revealed normal coronary arteries. Finally, the diagnosis of viral myocarditis was made on consideration of his fever, scattered red dots on his arms and legs and other auxiliary examination results obtained in the following days, which were supportive of the diagnosis. The patient improved on antiviral and myocardial protection therapy and was discharged 2 weeks later. Viral myocarditis is a common disease with a variable natural history. It remains challenging for doctors to differentiate between acute myocarditis and myocardial infarction, particularly in the early stages. A diagnosis of myocarditis should be made on the basis of synthetic evaluation of the evidence, including medical history, clinical presentation and results of the available auxiliary tests, in order to provide guidelines for treatment.",

        "abstract": "Au nanoparticles sensitized ZnO nanorod@nanoplatelet (NR@NP) core\u2013shell arrays have been synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method followed by a further modification using Au nanoparticles. The resulting Au\u2013ZnO NR@NP nanoarray exhibits promising behavior in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, giving rise to a largely enhanced photocurrent density, photoconversion efficiency as well as incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE), much superior to those of pristine ZnO nanorods arrays and ZnO NR@NP. This is attributed to the coordination of ZnO core\u2013shell hierarchical nanostructure and the surface-plasmon-resonance effect of Au nanoparticles, which facilitates the exposure of active sites and utilization of visible light. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm that the photogenerated electrons of ZnO transfer to Au, which suppresses the recombination of electron\u2013hole pairs. Therefore, this work provides a facile and cost-effective strategy for the construction of hierarchical metal/semiconductor nanoarrays, which can be potentially used in the field of energy storage and conversion.",

The sophisticated copolymer designed in this work can load the PDT photosensitizer (ZnPc) and chemotherapy drug (DOX) simultaneously, which exhibits an excellent performance in chemotherapy-PDT targeted cancer and tumor therapy for both in vitro studies performed with HepG2 cells and in vivo tests with mice.

This supramolecular agent was proved to exhibit excellent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorescence imaging (FI) behavior, as well as chemotherapy toward cancer (KB cell). The co-intercalated FA enables an efficient and selective drug delivery with good specificity.

Herein, Gd -doped monolayered-double-hydroxide (MLDH) nanosheets are prepared via a facile bottom-up synthesis method, with a precisely controlled composition and uniform morphology. MLDH nanosheets as drug carrier are demonstrated in coloading of doxorubicin and indocyanine green (DOX&ICG), with an ultrahigh drug loading content (LC) of 797.36% and an encapsulation efficiency (EE) of 99.67%. This is, as far as it is known, the highest LC level at nearly 100% of EE among previously reported 2D drug delivery systems so far. Interestingly, the as-prepared DOX&ICG/MLDH composite material shows both pH-controlled and near-infrared-irradiation-induced DOX release, which holds a promise in stimulated drug release. An in vivo dual-mode imaging, including near-infrared fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging, enables a noninvasive visualization of distribution profiles at the tumor site. In addition, in vitro and in vivo therapeutic evaluations demonstrate an excellent trimode synergetic anticancer activity and superior biocompatibility of DOX&ICG/MLDH. Therefore, MLDH nanosheets provide new perspectives in the design of multifunctional nanomedicine, which shows promising applications in controlled drug delivery and cancer theranostics.",

To solve this conundrum and obtain highly-efficient fluorescent emission, 2D exfoliated layered double hydroxide (ELDH) nanosheets were employed to localize Au NCs with a density as high as 5.44 \u00d7 10(13) cm(-2), by virtue of the surface confinement effect of ELDH. Both experimental studies and computational simulations testify that the excited electrons of Au NCs are strongly confined by MgAl-ELDH nanosheets, which results in a largely promoted QY as well as prolonged fluorescence lifetime (both \u223c7 times enhancement). In addition, the as-fabricated Au NC/ELDH hybrid material exhibits excellent imaging properties with good stability and biocompatibility in the intracellular environment. Therefore, this work provides a facile strategy to achieve highly luminescent Au NCs via surface-confined emission enhancement imposed by ultrathin inorganic nanosheets, which can be potentially used in bio-imaging and cell labelling.

However, the photosensitizers which require for the generation of singlet oxygen remain inadequate because of their lack of long-wavelength absorption, weak hydrophilicity, and poor biocompatibility. Here, we develop near-infrared laser activated supramolecular photosensitizers (isophthalic acid/layered double hydroxide nanohybrids) for efficient two-photon photodynamic therapy. The singlet oxygen quantum yield of nanohybrid is up to 0.74. Critically, in vitro tests verify the superior anti-cancer properties of nanohybrid with an IC determine to be 0.153\u2009\u03bcg\u2009mL. The nanohybrids take advantage of the superior tissue penetration of 808\u2009nm laser irradiation and exhibit a dramatically strong ability to ablate tumors in vivo, with extremely low toxicity. This work provides the proof of concept that ultralong-lived triplet excitons can function as two-photon-activated photosensitizers for an effective singlet oxygen generation.",

        "abstract": "Recently, ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have attracted considerable research interest in biomedical applications, owing to their intriguing quantum size and surface effects. In this work, a one-step \"bottom-up\" method is developed to prepare rare-earth (Gd and Yb) co-doped layered double hydroxide (LDH) monolayer nanosheets, with a precisely controlled composition and uniform morphology. Due to the successful introduction of Gd and Yb into the LDH host layer, the Gd&Yb-LDH monolayer nanosheets exhibit excellent magnetic resonance (MR)/X-ray computed tomography (CT) dual-mode imaging functionality. Moreover, the Gd&Yb-LDH monolayer nanosheets achieve an ultrahigh loading of a chemotherapeutic drug (SN38) with a loading content (LC) of 925%, which is a one order of magnitude enhancement compared with previously reported delivery systems of hydrophobic drugs. Interestingly, by further combination with indocyanine green (ICG),  tri-mode imaging, including CT, MR and near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging, is achieved, which enables a noninvasive visualization of cancer cell distribution with deep spatial resolution and high sensitivity. In addition,  and  therapeutic evaluations demonstrate an extremely high tri-mode synergetic anticancer activity and superior biocompatibility of SN38&ICG/Gd&Yb-LDH. Therefore, this work demonstrates a paradigm for the synthesis of novel multifunctional 2D monolayer materials  a facile \"bottom-up\" route, which shows promising applications in cancer synergetic theranostics.",

        "abstract": "A new targeted photothermal agent used in cancer photothermal therapy (PTT) is synthesized by co-intercalation of indocyanine green (ICG) and targeting folic acid (FA) into the interlamellar gallery of layered double hydroxide (LDH). The resulting composite material (ICG\u2013FA/LDH) possesses an interlayer distance of 2.503 nm, and a uniform particle size with an equivalent hydrodynamic diameter of 127 nm. ICG presents a monomeric state in the LDH gallery, owing to the supermolecular interactions between the LDH host and ICG guest, which results in a largely-enhanced photothermal conversion efficiency. In vitro tests performed with KB cells demonstrate a highly enhanced cellar uptake and excellent imaging ability for the ICG\u2013FA/LDH. The photothermal conversion studies show that an ultra-low dosage of ICG\u2013FA/LDH (equivalent ICG 10 \u03bcg mL\u22121) under weak near-infrared (NIR) irradiation (8 min; 1.1 W cm\u22122) achieves a significant temperature increase from 19.8 \u00b0C to 51.0 \u00b0C. Therefore, a satisfactory in vitro PTT effectiveness of the ICG\u2013FA/LDH composite is obtained, and it exhibits cellular damage as high as 87.4% with an ultra-low dosage of ICG (8 \u03bcg mL\u22121) and weak NIR irradiation (1.1 W cm\u22122, 12 min). In addition, the photothermal agent ICG\u2013FA/LDH displays good targeting capability, biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity. It is expected that the unique ICG\u2013FA/LDH with integrated fluorescence imaging and photothermal therapy can be potentially used in the cell labeling and PTT area.",

The nanovehicle shows a uniform platelet morphology with an average diameter of \u223c171 nm. The unique host-guest interactions lead to a high dispersion of DOX, and in vitro tests reveal a legible and strong fluorescence imaging for the DOX-FA/LDH sample. In addition, the DOX-FA/LDH material produces a high anticancer activity toward HepG2 cells but rather low cytotoxicity to the normal cells (L02 cells), as a result of the overexpression of FA towards cancer cells. This work provides a facile approach for the design and preparation of a drug nanovehicle with significantly enhanced biocompatibility, diagnosis and targeted therapy, which can be potentially applied in medical imaging and chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) systems have broad applications in visual detection, intelligent materials, and biological imaging, all of which favor the transmission of light through multiple dimensions and in diverse directions. Herein, we have demonstrated multi-dimensional (0D and 2D) FRET within a multi-layer ultrathin film (UTF) by employing a layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly technique. The anionic block copolymer micelle poly(tert-butyl acrylate-co-ethyl acrylate-co-methacrylic acid) (PTBEM) is chosen as a molecular carrier for the incorporation of bis(8-hydroxyquinolate) zinc (Znq2) and open-ring merocyanine (MC) (denoted as (Znq2/MC)@PTBEM). Alternatively, electrostatic assembly is performed with cationic layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets (denoted as [(Znq2/MC)@PTBEM/LDH]n). This [(Znq2/MC)@PTBEM/LDH]n system offers a multi-dimensional propagation medium and ensures that the FRET donor and acceptor are located within their Forster radii in each direction. The system demonstrates a FRET process that can be switched via alternating ultraviolet/visible (UV/vis) irradiation, with tunable blue\u2013green/red fluorescence, resulting in a FRET efficiency as high as 81.7%. It is expected that this assembly method, which uses 0D micelles on a 2D layered material, can be extended to other systems for further development of multi-dimensional FRET.",

        "abstract": "Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) resonance energy transfer (ERET) systems have shown excellent potential in analysis and detection fields because of its supersensitivity, high level of controllability, and amplified signal. Herein, a solid film sensor (described as (3-AMS-CoAl LDHs/CdTe QDs)n) was fabricated layer-by-layer by assembling positive luminol (3-AMS)-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles and negative CdTe quantum dots (QDs), which produces an effective ERET from luminol (donor) to QDs (acceptor). The ECL intensities of luminol and QDs are enhanced simultaneously, which can be related to the sensitization of QDs and occurrence of ERET, respectively. The optimized ECL intensity of the thin film (3-AMS-CoAl LDHs/CdTe QDs)10 (pH = 7.5) can be obtained by tuning the pH and cycle number (n). Moreover, the (3-AMS-CoAl LDHs/CdTe QDs)10 modified electrode shows good sensitivity and selectivity towards trinitrotoluene (TNT) detection based on the ratiometric ECL signal, which could open up an effective way to apply solid ERET films in trace ECL sensors.",

        "title": "In situ synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbon dots in the interlayer region of a layered double hydroxide with tunable quantum yield",
        "abstract": "Carbon dots (CDs) have drawn considerable research interest due to their fascinating physicochemical properties and optical performance. Herein, we report the preparation of nitrogen-doped carbon dots (N-CDs) via an in situ hydrothermal reaction of citric acid (CA) and ethylenediamine (EDA) in the confined two-dimensional gallery of a layered double hydroxide (LDH). The resulting N-CDs/LDH material shows a long-range ordered structure, with blue-emissive, sheet-like ultrathin N-CDs (\u223c0.62 nm) accommodated in the LDH gallery. In particular, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) can be tuned by adjusting the charge density of the LDH host layer, and the maximum value accomplishes 61.63%. This variable performance is attributed to different N-doping contents, which is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), elemental analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Moreover, the N-CDs/LDH composite exhibits temperature-responsive emission under sub-zero conditions (from \u2212150 \u00b0C to 0 \u00b0C). Its potential application is demonstrated by incorporating N-CDs/LDH within a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) polymer matrix, which is then used as a modulator to transfer ultraviolet light to blue emission. This work provides a facile method for the preparation of highly luminescent N-CD-based solid-state materials through an in situ interlayer reaction, which can serve as promising candidates in optical and display devices.",

        "abstract": "Multi-therapeutic methodologies have attracted considerable attention toward cancer therapy, which can overcome the limitation of a single therapy and achieve an optimized anticancer efficacy. Herein, we prepared a systematic anticancer drug by intercalating zinc phthalocyanines (ZnPc) into a layered double hydroxide (LDH) gallery, followed by loading doxorubicin (DOX) on the surface (denoted as ZnPc-DOX/LDH). ZnPc is accommodated in the interlayer region of the LDH, which results in a largely enhanced photodynamic therapeutic (PDT) efficiency; while the physisorbed DOX affords a chemotherapeutic effect. In vitro tests performed with KB cells indicate a synergistic anticancer performance as well as excellent biocompatibility compared with pristine ZnPc and DOX. This study demonstrates a promising bio-composite for PDT-chemotherapy systematic therapy, which shows potential application in the field of cancer therapy.",

Structural characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that the DOX molecule is uniformly arranged and oriented at the surface of the MLDHs with a binding energy of 15.90 eV, showing significant electrostatic interaction. With the assistance of the targeting agent folic acid (FA), DOX-FA/MLDHs demonstrate targeted cellular uptake and superior anticancer behavior based on in vitro tests performed with cancer cells. In addition, this composite material exhibits a selective release toward cancer cells and good biocompatibility with normal cells, which would guarantee its practical applications in cancer therapy.",

Herein, we report the fabrication of fluorescent ultrathin films (UTFs) by embedding CDs into the 2D layered double hydroxides (LDHs) nanosheets through layer-by-layer assembly. The resulting UTFs present long-range ordered structure and improved luminescent properties compared with the CDs drop-casted films, including quantum yield (57.17% vs 3.04%) and fluorescence lifetime (14.47 ns vs 0.813 ns). This significant enhancement is due to the molecular level dispersion of CDs and the confinement of photoexcited electrons imposed by LDH nanosheets, which is confirmed by both experimental studies and density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations. Moreover, the UTFs display temperature-responsive photoluminescence (PL) and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) performances. Therefore, this work p...",

However, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) usually determines the efficiency of practical water electrolysis due to its sluggish four-electron process. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have attracted increasing attention as one of the ideal and promising electrocatalysts for water oxidation due to their excellent activity, high stability in basic conditions, as well as their earth-abundant compositions. In this review, we discuss the recent progress on LDH-based OER electrocatalysts in terms of active sites, host-guest engineering, and catalytic performances. Moreover, further developments and challenges in developing promising electrocatalysts based on LDHs are discussed from the viewpoint of molecular design and engineering.",

This article describes the design and fabrication of a photoresponsive switch via a two-step procedure: (i) spiropyran (SP) as a chromophore was encapsulated within a block copolymer (poly(tert-butyl acrylate-co-ethyl acrylate-co-methacrylic acid), PTBEM) to produce SP@PTBEM micelle; (ii) an organic\u2013inorganic ultrathin film (UTF) was prepared by layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly of the negatively charged SP@PTBEM micelle and positively charged MgAl-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoplatelets (denoted as (SP@PTBEM/LDHs)n UTF; n represents the bilayer number). Fluorescence spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicate a uniform and ordered layered structure with stepwise growth. The resulting (SP@PTBEM/LDHs)n UTF serves as an intelligent photoresponsive switch based on the structural transformation between SP and merocyanine (MC), which is triggered...",

        "abstract": "The thermal topotactic transformation mechanism of MgAl layered double hydroxides (LDHs) is investigated by a combined theoretical and experimental study. Thermogravimetric differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) results reveal that the LDH phase undergoes four key endothermic events at 230, 330, 450, and 800\u2009\u00b0C. DFT calculations show that the LDH decomposes into CO2 and residual O atoms via a monodentate intermediate at 330\u2009\u00b0C. At 450\u2009\u00b0C, the metal cations almost maintain their original distribution within the LDH(001) facet during the thermal dehydration process, but migrate substantially along the c-axis direction perpendicular to the (001) facet; this indicates that the metal arrangement/dispersion in the LDH matrix is maintained two-dimensionally. A complete collapse of the layered structure occurs at 800\u2009\u00b0C, which results in a totally disordered cation distribution and many holes in the final product. The structures of the simulated intermediates are highly consistent with the observed in\u2005situ powder XRD data for the MgAl LDH sample calcined at the corresponding temperatures. Understanding the structural topotactic transformation process of LDHs would provide helpful information for the design and preparation of metal/metal oxides functional materials derived from LDH precursors.

In this work, the electronic properties (band structure, density of states (DOS), and band edge placement) of MIIMIII-LDHs (MII = Mg, Co, Ni and Zn; MIII = Al and Ga) were studied in detail. The thermodynamic mechanism toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was investigated by using the density functional theory plus U (DFT + U) method. The calculation results of band structure indicate that Mg and Zn-based LDHs (band gap energies larger than 3.1 eV) are ultraviolet responsive, while Co and Ni-based LDHs are responsive to visible light (band gap energies less than 3.1 eV). The DOS calculations reveal that the photogenerated hole localizes on the surface hydroxyl group of LDHs, facilitating the oxidization of a water molecule without a long transportation route.

X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and elemental microanalysis confirmed the successful intercalation of the guest ions into the LDH. The guests could also be de-intercalated and recovered from the host intact. In situ XRD was used to probe the mechanisms of the reactions, and the intercalation of PAA proceeded via clear intermediate phases. In contrast, the SAA and DPA reactions did not show any intermediates, but the organic intercalates exhibited changes in their interlayer spacing as the reaction progressed. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to investigate the interlayer structure of the intercalation compounds. It was found that the intermediates observed in situ correspond to local energy minima in the MD simulations. MD can thus predict the course of ...",

        "abstract": "MgAl-CO(3) layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been employed to treat high fluoride concentration solution. The influences of solution pH, initial fluoride concentration and other anions in the solution were investigated by a series of batch experiments. A marked decrease in the amount of adsorbed fluoride by LDHs is observed with increasing pH. The extent of fluoride removal in the presence of other anions decreases in the order HCO(3)(-)>Cl(-)>H(2)PO(4)(-)>SO(4)(2-). The equilibrium isotherm for fluoride uptake corresponds closely to the Langmuir-Freundlich (L-F) model. The maximum capacity of LDHs for fluoride ions and the Gibbs free energy (DeltaG(0)) for the defluoridation process were calculated to be 319.8+/-5.7mg/g and -9.0+/-0.66kJ/mol, respectively. The negative value of DeltaG(0) indicates the spontaneous nature of the treatment process. Four kinetic models have been evaluated in order to attempt to fit the experimental data, namely the pseudo-first order, the pseudo-second order, the modified multiplex and the double exponential models. It was found that the modified multiplex model, involving a rapid first order step and a slow second order step most closely described the kinetics. The activation energies for the two steps are 37.2+/-5.26 and 72.6+/-4.52kJ/mol, respectively, suggesting that the rapid step is controlled by diffusion processes, whilst the second step is controlled by the reaction of fluoride with the LDHs.",

        "abstract": "Gas barrier films with water-vapor-permeability have exhibited broad application prospects in gas separation and dehumidification. Herein, multilayer films comprised of layered double hydroxides (LDH) nanosheets and carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMC) were fabricated via layer-by-layer assembly. The resulting (LDH/CMC)n films show excellent gas barrier properties, which are ascribed to the significantly increased pathway for gas permeation originating from the large aspect ratio and high orientation of two-dimensional LDH nanosheets. Unlike traditional gas barrier films with nonselective blocking effect for various gases (including water vapor), the (LDH/CMC)n films exhibit unusual moisture permselective property. The moisture-permeable property was related with the hygroscopicity of CMC and hydrophilicity of LDH, which can enrich the water molecules from the surroundings and aggrandize the osmotic pressure for water vapor, resulting in an uncommon improvement of water vapor transmission. It is interesting to find that the (LDH/CMC)n films exhibit enhanced gas (O2, CO2, CH4 and N2) barrier properties upon treatment in a humid environment, due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the infiltrated water molecules and hydrophilic groups in CMC, thus padding the interstitial space of the CMC molecular chains and increasing the gas transmission path. The reduction of free volume and extension of the gas transmission path further enhance the gas barrier properties of (LDH/CMC)n films. Moreover, the (LDH/CMC)n films represent the water vapor permselective property in mixed gas (including O2, CO2, CH4, N2 and water vapor), while maintaining the barrier for other gases, which can be potentially applied in air dehydration and dehumidification of natural gas.",

Herein, we designed and fabricated an excellent gas barrier film by using polyvinyl pyrrolidone modified ultrathin layered double hydroxide nanoplatelets (U-mLDH) and nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) as building blocks. The resultant (U-mLDH/NBR) 30  film displays significantly decreased (reduced by 92.2% compared with NBR film) oxygen transmission rate with 0.626\u00a0cm 3 \u00a0m \u20132 \u00a0day \u20131 \u00a0atm \u20131 , and much lower relative permeability in comparison with reported rubber composites. The improved gas barrier performance is ascribed to the prolonged passage of oxygen molecules and the decreased free space arising from large aspect ratio of U-mLDH and good interfacial compatibility. In addition, the (U-mLDH/NBR) 30  film also possesses high thermal stability and satisfactory mechanical property, which would guarantee its practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Gas and moisture barrier materials are of crucial importance in various application fields, including food/drug packaging and encapsulation of electronic devices. Herein, a dual-barrier film to gas and water vapor was fabricated by a facile and cost-effective spin-coating of amphiphilic surfactant (Tween 80) modified LDH nanoplatelets (denoted as LDH-80) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The resultant (LDH-80/PDMS)15 film exhibits low O2 and H2O transmission rates with \u223c0.701 and \u223c0.049 cm3 m\u22122 d\u22121 atm\u22121, respectively, smaller than those for most of the reported barrier materials. The remarkable barrier properties are ascribed to the prolonged diffusion length for gas permeation and improved inorganic\u2013organic interfacial compatibility between LDH-80 and PDMS. Taking advantage of this unique dual-barrier property, an aluminum foil substrate coated with (LDH-80/PDMS)n film displays an excellent anti-corrosion effect due to the inhibition of oxygen-consuming corrosion, which enables the (LDH-80/PDMS)n films to be promising candidates in metal surface protection.",

        "abstract": "For Asians, prominent zygomatic region is a sign of masculinity; therefore, reduction malarplasty is becoming more and more popular in Asian women.The purpose of this study is to analyze the biomechanical changes of zygomaticus and masseter, and to explore the underlying causes of relevant complications using the 3 popular techniques of reduction malarplasty.From May 2000 to August 2009, 259 female patients underwent traditional osteotomy through coronary incision, malomaxillary suture with L-shaped osteotomy through intraoral approach, and the modified X.M.'s technique. The mechanical and anatomical causes of the relevant complications such as facial asymmetry caused by detachment of zygomaticus and masseter, facial sagging, and downward movement of malar point in 3 surgical procedures were analyzed and compared postoperatively among the 3 procedures.In the traditional osteotomy through coronary incision, the inside cheek fat pad moved interoinferiorly because the greater and lesser zygomatic muscles were stripped from the attachment points, whereas masseter was relatively less stripped from its attachment point, which affects mechanical direction and contraction strength less, which possibly leads to the downward movement of the fractured extremity of zygomatic bone. In the L-shaped osteotomy, the zygomatic arch slided interoinferiorly because of the operative design, and masseter's strong extroinferior traction often caused fixation loosening between the former and latter bone margin. As a result, the fractured zygomatic bone moved downward along with zygomaticus, masseter, and fat pad. In the modified X.M.'s technique, complications were relatively fewer, which may be related to less injury to the fixation system of zygomatic bone and less biomechanical changes in masseter and zygomatic muscles.Surgeons should base their choice of reduction malarplasty not only on thoroughness of the operation but also on biomechanical changes in the zygomatic region and patients' individual conditions.",

The reconstructed complex was placed in new position with rigid fixation. Clinic evaluations were performed before and after operative osteotomies such as cephalometry (measurement of interorbital distance, IOD), exophthalmos (measurement with Hetel exophthalmometer), the angle (between orbital horizontal level and bilateral tragus linkage, A-OT), and the linear distance (between lateral canthus and tragus, LC-T), then the gap differences were analyzed before and after operation.Nearly normal orbital volumes, better contour of orbit and midface, improved eyelids and visions were achieved in total 44 cases. There were 5 cases of supraorbital osteotomy (intracranial routine), 8 cases of medial orbital osteotomy, 3 cases of inferior orbital osteotomy, and 28 cases of both lateral and inferior orbital osteotomy in these series. No complications were found after surgery. The orbital and midfacial appearances were improved significantly.Lamella and complex osteotomies of orbital rim and wall are proved to be safe and effective to correct most deformities of orbital and periorbital region and various kinds of orbital malposition.",

The osteoblast phetotypes (osteocalcin, alkaline, osteoponcin and type-1 collagen) were measured with the RT-PCR and ELISA, and the explanted sagittal sutures were then evaluated under light microscopy.The cells, treated with the insulin-like growth factor 1, significantly produced more osteocalcin, alkaline, osteoponcin and type-1 collagen than those without insulin-like growth factor 1. The fusion of the sagittal suture explants will delay till to 30 days when it was not treated with IGF1. However, in the group with IGF1 the fusion was observed to start in 8 days, and a small amount of the sagittal suture fusion was found at the 20th day while a large amount was at the 30th day.The IGF1 has a direct effect on the fusion of cranial suture due to enhancing bone induction of cranial suture cell.",

In patients aged 1 - 3 years old, the fronto-orbital advancing osteotomy to deepen the upper part of orbital cavity was employed. In patients aged 4 - 15 years old, Le Fort III osteotomy and distraction osteogenesis were selected. In patients aged 16 years old or more, Le Fort III osteotomy or monobloc craniofacial osteotomy with immediately advancement of the midface segments were selected.Good results were achieved for all 18 patients. The proptosis reduced 7.8 mm postoperatively. The depth of the skull base increased 8.2 mm and inferior orbit margin was advanced 7.8 mm as compared with the preoperative measurements. The angle between the maxilla and skull base (SNA) increased 9 degree. All of these measurements indicated that the proptosis and craniofacial contouring were approached to the normal situation after surgical intervention.Both immediate advancement and gradual distraction after frontal, orbital, and maxillar osteotomy to enlarge the orbital cavities are the best approaches for the treatment of exophthalmos in craniofacial synostosis.",

Numerous surgical resections of the malar and mandibular angles began in the 1980s. The objective of this study was to investigate the facial proportion index before and after facial contour surgery. All 266 patients were subjected to L-shaped reduction malarplasty and reduction of mandibular angles with partial masseter muscle resection. All computed tomographic parameters (preoperative and 2 years postoperative) were conducted on facial morphometry to reveal the change of the facial proportion index of hard and soft tissue, respectively, such as the widest part of the mid face (WM), widest part of the lower face (WL), facial height (FH), WM/WL, WM/FH, and WL/FH. All patients were satisfied with the optimal outcome of the combined facial contour surgery. Morphometric analysis indicated that the ideal WM/WL ratio was 1.27 \u00b1 0.1 (1.21 \u00b1 0.09 preoperative) in hard tissue and 1.2 \u00b1 0.12 (1.16 \u00b1 0.12 preoperative) in soft tissue 2 years postoperatively. The combined facial contour surgery could acquire an ideal facial contour for Chinese patients. Furthermore, the relative proportion index can be referenced as the standard for preoperative design.",

        "abstract": "Augmentation rhinoplasty is one of the most popular cosmetic surgeries in Asia, and both dorsal augmentation and mobile nose modifications are emphasized for the characters of the Asian nose and for Asians who are fond of the Western nasal shape. The goal in rhinoplasty is to create a balanced and natural appearance. Therefore, the cosmetic aspects, postoperative complications, and functional aspects should be regarded as a whole. In fact, the first 2 aspects had been widely reported in a large number of literatures. However, the functional aspects about mobility have been ignored by most surgeons. A sample method was used in this article to investigate the range of mobility of normal nasal tip in Asians and analyze the correlations of the nasal mobility and alloplastic materials. A total of 170 healthy adult subjects aged from 18 to 35 were included and were classified into 3 groups standing for normal nose and rhinoplasty with L-shaped silicon implants with e-PTFE implants. A 3D raster surface scanner was used to capture the images of the subjects accurately and rapidly in this detailed anatomical study. The range of nasal mobility (to right or left) in Asian normal women was 35.53\u200a\u00b1\u200a4.84 degrees, and the length of mobile part was 16.62\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.94\u200amm, which accounts for 40%\u200a\u00b1\u200a5% of nasal length. The L-shaped alloplastic implants would reduce the nasal mobility, and there had been differences among the changes caused by different implants, which might cause unsatisfactory outcomes in patients. Results of the study indicated that augmentation rhinoplasty should be performed as well as augmented mammaplasty which attaches importance not only to the static and dynamic appearance of the nasal tip but also to the feeling when it is touched.",

Furthermore, according to the position of soft tissue or bone, the character and degree of clefts or dysplasia and the results of CT scanning, we subdivided the congenital deformities based on S (skin), T (tissue), and O (OS). Arabic numerals were used to express the degree of the abnormality.Of all the cases analyzed with the STO classification, No. III and IV clefts are often seen in the infraorbital region (24.70%). No. IX and X clefts are mostly seen in the supraorbital region (38.27%). The relationship between the cleft types and involved tissue has not been found.The STO classification reinforces Tessier classification. It offers the basis for craniofacial cleft repair.",

We found that the content of Mn in spoiled heap soil (up to 3869.14 mg/kg) was highest in five heavy metals, and the next in order was Pb> Ni > Cu >Cd. There was similar distribution of the five heavy metals both in plants and in soil. The value of AC of the tested dominant plants to heavy metals was low, however the value of TC relative high. The value of TC of Carpesium abrotanoides L. to Cu, Tridaxprocumbens L. to Pb, and Artemisia indica Willd to Cd, was 5.1, 3.3 and 6.0, respectively. Furthermore, the value of TC to Mn in 8 out of 12 species of plants exceeded 1.

        "abstract": "Neuronal remodeling in response to deafferenting lesions in the brain can be enhanced by estradiol (E2). Astrocytes are among the targets of E2 in complex interactions with neurons and may support or inhibit neuronal remodeling. In ovariectomized female rats given entorhinal cortex lesions, E2 replacement inhibited the increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) protein. To model the role of E2 in these complex processes, we used the \"wounding-in-a-dish\" of astrocyte-neuron cocultures. Low physiological E2 (1 pM) blocks the wound-induced increase of GFAP expression (transcription and protein) and enhances neurite outgrowth. The transcriptional responses to E2 during wounding are mediated by sequences in the 5'-upstream region of the rat GFAP promoter. Concurrently, E2 reorganized astrocytic laminin into extracellular fibrillar arrays, which others have shown support neurite outgrowth. The inhibition of GFAP expression by E2 in this model is consistent with in vivo findings that E2 enhanced recovery from deafferenting cortical lesions by increased neurite outgrowth in association with decreased GFAP expression. More generally, we hypothesize that physiological variations in E2 levels modulate neuronal plasticity through direct effects on GFAP transcription that, in turn, modify GFAP-containing intermediate filaments and reorganize astrocytic laminin.",

        "abstract": "Periodic changes in ovarian steroid levels during fertility cycles affect learning both in humans and in rats in parallel with electrophysiological and morphological fluctuations in selective neuronal populations. In particular, during the estrous cycle of the female rat, hippocampal CA1 region undergoes cyclic modifications in synaptic density. To investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in synaptic remodeling during the estrous cycle, we analyzed the expression of three presynaptic markers, synaptotagmin I, synaptotagmin IV, and synaptophysin, in the female adult rat brain by in situ hybridization. Relative abundance in mRNA for these three markers was quantified at four phases of the estrous cycle: diestrus, proestrus (AM and PM), and estrus. mRNA levels for syt1 exhibited cyclic variations in pyramidal neurons of the CA3 region of hippocampus during the estrous cycle, while mRNA levels for syt4 and SYN were relatively invariant in this or other regions of the hippocampus. Because CA3 pyramidal neurons make synaptic contacts in CA1, modulation of syt1 expression in CA3 may participate in the changes in synaptic density observed in CA1 during the estrous cycle. Furthermore, both syt1 and SYN mRNA varied cyclically in layer II, but not in layer III of entorhinal cortex, while syt4 remained unchanged throughout the cycle. These data suggest that regular variations in steroid hormone levels during fertility cycles may alter the properties of several networks involved in information processing and learning and memory through altered levels of presynaptic proteins.",

The primary source of secreted ApoE and ApoJ (clusterin) in the brain is glia. Regulation of these apolipoproteins in mixed glial cultures from rat cerebral cortex differed most strongly between neonatal- and adult-derived glia. Basal secretion of ApoJ was two-fold greater in neonatal than adult glia. Responses to cytokines also differed by donor age. In adult glia, IL-6 increased ApoE secretion, but slightly decreased ApoJ. Both IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 treatments increased ApoJ secretion from adult glia, with little effect on ApoE. In contrast to adult glia, neonatal ApoJ secretion did not respond to IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, or TNF\u03b1, and ApoE secretion from neonatal glia was slightly increased by IL-6. These differences may contribute to age-related neuroinflammatory processes, and are pertinent to the general use of neonatal-derived primary glia in models for neurodegenerative disease.",

Here, we describe a differential stress resistance (DSR) method that focuses instead on protecting the organism but not cancer cells against chemotherapy. Short-term starved S. cerevisiae or cells lacking proto-oncogene homologs were up to 1,000 times better protected against oxidative stress or chemotherapy drugs than cells expressing the oncogene homolog Ras2(val19). Low-glucose or low-serum media also protected primary glial cells but not six different rat and human glioma and neuroblastoma cancer cell lines against hydrogen peroxide or the chemotherapy drug/pro-oxidant cyclophosphamide. Finally, short-term starvation provided complete protection to mice but not to injected neuroblastoma cells against a high dose of the chemotherapy drug/pro-oxidant etoposide. These studies describe a starvation-based DSR strategy to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy and suggest that specific agents among those that promote oxidative stress and DNA damage have the potential to maximize the differential toxicity to normal and cancer cells.",

        "abstract": "The study of the chronological life span of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which measures the survival of populations of non-dividing yeast, has resulted in the identification of homologous genes and pathways that promote aging in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals. Using a competitive genome-wide approach, we performed a screen of a complete set of approximately 4,800 viable deletion mutants to identify genes that either increase or decrease chronological life span. Half of the putative short-/long-lived mutants retested from the primary screen were confirmed, demonstrating the utility of our approach. Deletion of genes involved in vacuolar protein sorting, autophagy, and mitochondrial function shortened life span, confirming that respiration and degradation processes are essential for long-term survival. Among the genes whose deletion significantly extended life span are ACB1, CKA2, and TRM9, implicated in fatty acid transport and biosynthesis, cell signaling, and tRNA methylation, respectively. Deletion of these genes conferred heat-shock resistance, supporting the link between life span extension and cellular protection observed in several model organisms. The high degree of conservation of these novel yeast longevity determinants in other species raises the possibility that their role in senescence might be conserved.",

        "abstract": "Sir2 is a conserved deacetylase that modulates life span in yeast, worms, and flies and stress response in mammals. In yeast, Sir2 is required for maintaining replicative life span, and increasing Sir2 dosage can delay replicative aging. We address the role of Sir2 in regulating chronological life span in yeast. Lack of Sir2 along with calorie restriction and/or mutations in the yeast AKT homolog, Sch9, or Ras pathways causes a dramatic chronological life-span extension. Inactivation of Sir2 causes uptake and catabolism of ethanol and upregulation of many stress-resistance and sporulation genes. These changes while sufficient to extend chronological life span in wild-type yeast require severe calorie restriction or additional mutations to extend life span of sir2Delta mutants. Our results demonstrate that effects of SIR2 on chronological life span are opposite to replicatve life span and suggest that the relevant activities of Sir2-like deacetylases may also be complex in higher eukaryotes.",

        "abstract": "During normal aging, microglia develop an activated phenotype characterized by morphologic changes and induction of CD11b, MHC II, and other inflammatory markers. We show that macrosialin (CD68), a macrophage-specific protein, is increased by aging in selected brain regions of male C57BL/6NNia mice. In corpus callosum and striatum, macrosialin mRNA and protein increased >or=50% (24 months versus 4 months); hippocampus and cerebellum were unchanged. Caloric restriction (CR) attenuated these age-related increases. Since CR attenuates age-related increases in oxidative damage and inflammation, we examined whether oxidized lipoproteins and inflammatory processes regulate macrosialin using murine BV-2 microglial cells as a model. Oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL) induced macrosialin protein by 50%. Moreover, macrosialin was induced in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) which activates inflammatory pathways in BV-2 cells. Thus, the previously documented increase in oxidized lipoproteins, inflammation, and microglial activation during normal aging may contribute to the age-related increase in macrosialin expression.",

        "abstract": "Dietary interventions are potentially effective therapies for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). We tested the effect of 4-day fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) cycles on a chronic dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced murine model resulting in symptoms and pathology associated with IBD. These FMD cycles reduced intestinal inflammation, increased stem cell number, stimulated protective gut microbiota, and reversed intestinal pathology caused by DSS, whereas water-only fasting increased regenerative and reduced inflammatory markers without reversing pathology. Transplants of Lactobacillus or fecal microbiota from DSS- and FMD-treated mice reversed DSS-induced colon shortening, reduced inflammation, and increased colonic stem cells. In a clinical trial, three FMD cycles reduced markers associated with systemic inflammation. The effect of FMD cycles on microbiota composition, immune cell profile, intestinal stem cell levels and the reversal of pathology associated with IBD in mice, and the anti-inflammatory effects demonstrated in a clinical trial show promise for FMD cycles to ameliorate IBD-associated inflammation in humans.",

        "abstract": "Aging is associated with neuron atrophy and impaired sprouting after lesions. In contrast during normal aging without neurodegenerative diseases, astrocytes display increasing activation, with progressive increases of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) beginning before midlife. Because many neuronal functions depend on astrocytic support, we developed a heterochronic co-culture system to study influences of aging astrocytes on neurons. Neurite outgrowth by embryonic neurons (E18) was markedly less when co-cultured with confluent astrocytes derived from old (24 mo) versus young (3 mo) cortex. These impairments were reversible. Diminishing the GFAP levels of old astrocytes by RNAi restored neurite outgrowth, whereas overexpression of GFAP in young astrocytes modeled these effects of aging by reducing neurite outgrowth. Quantitative relationships were found such that neurites were co-localized with high intensity laminin, which both varied inversely with GFAP. These results implicate increased astrocytic GFAP expression as a proximal cause of neuron atrophy during normal aging.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To study the effects of GP \u2161b/\u2162a on matrix metalloproteinase of blood platelets-endothelial cells mRNA express.Methods:The HUVECs was cultured in vitro.When the cells were sub-confluent,add serum free medium,resting platelets,\u03b1-thrombin-stimulated platelets and interleukin-l\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) into the 24 well plate respectively.After 60 min co-incubation under cell culture conditions,all platelets were removed by gentle washing.After an additional 6 hours of incubation of the endothelial cells,supernatant was aspirated and detected the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by SDS-PAGE zymography and detected the mRNA by RT-PCR.HUVEC was analyzed by flow cytometry.Results:HUVEC was incubated with \u03b1-thrombin-activated platelets.SDS-PAGE zymography revealed expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was only slightly induced by resting platelets(P<0.05).However,activated platelets significantly induced secretion of the 2 MMPs(P<0.01) to a comparable extent as achieved by IL-1\u03b2.In addition,a second,lower band at 66kDa revealed MMP-2 activation on adhesion of activated platelets.Endothelial expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was significantly restrained by GRGDSP and monoclonal antibody of anti-GP \u2161b/\u2162a (7E3). HUVEC incubation with activated platelets induced mRNA significantly expression of MMP-2,MT1-MMP and uPAR(P<0.01) comparable with the control group,but nonstimulated platelets did nothing.Expression of mRNA greatly decreased after administrating GRGDSP or 7E3.Conclusion: Activated platelets significantly induced secretion of the 2 MMPs to a comparable extent as achieved by IL-1\u03b2,and can increase mRNA expression of MMP-2,MTl-MMP,and uPAR.GP \u2161b/\u2162a blockade may not only inhibit platelet aggregation at the vulnerable plaque,but also may prevent platelet adhesion mediated inflammatory cascades.",

        "abstract": "AIM To observe the effect of sulodexide on early diabetic nephropathy,and to seek new treatment method for diabetic nephropathy.METHODS The treatment research was made within 60 cases of type 2 diabetic nephropathy patients (with 30 male,and 30 female aging from 43-70 a),their urine albumin excretion rate (UAER) within 24 h was 30-300 mg,and non was accompanied by hypertension,the illness course of them was from 6 mo to 30 a.After the metabolic control was stabilized,the original treatment plan was maintained.The patients were divided randomly into 3 treatment groups:routine group,losartan group (50 mg po,qd),and sulodexide group (using 600 LSU,iv,or im, bid,sulodexide for 4 wk;and then continuing with 250 LSU,po ,bid,for 8 wk),and compared the index changes after 3 mo treatment.The test index includesd:UAER ( be tested every 4 wk before and after the treatments),BP,FPG, HbAlc,C peptide on an empty stomach,TC,TG,high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C),low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C),ALT,r-GT,BUN,Cr,blood viscosity,Hct,FIB,blood plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), endothelin (El'),serum nitric oxide(NO).RESULTS The results showed that the UAER change of routine group was not obvious,and the statistic analysis showed no obvious difference.The UAER of losartan group dropped from (90.33\u00b135.56) mg\u00b724 h~(-1) to (58.76\u00b133.21 )mg\u00b724 h~(-1),and the UAER of sulodexide group dropped from (88.83\u00b143.18) mg\u00b724 h~(-1) to ( 56.64\u00b132.96)mg\u00b724 h~(-1) after the treatment.UAER of these 2 groups both appeared obvious difference after the use of this drug (P values were both less than 0.01).After 3 rno treatment the UAER of losartan group dropped by 34.04%,while that of sulodexide group dropped by 33.62%,there was no obvious difference between these 2 groups.The UAER of these 2 groups decreased as the treatment was prolonged,and the after treatment UAER was obvi- ously different from that of conventional treatment group.After applying the drug,and serum NO was obviously increased, blood viscosity,whole blood deoxidized viscidity,and index of PAI-1,FIB,ET,etc,all had certain decrement.The blood plasma ET level of losartan group dropped obviously after the treatment.However,there was no obvious change with the index like FPG,HbAlc,TC,TG,HDL-C,LDL-C,ALT,r-GT,BUN,Cr,C peptide on an empty stomach, Hct,and BP for these 3 groups.CONCLUSION Sulodexide can reduce the UAER of type 2 early diabetic nephropathy, and postpone or even reverse the development of nephropathy.The longer the drug is applied,the more the patient can benefit.The effect of sulodexide on diabetic nephropathy is realized through decreasing blood viscosity,PAI-1,FIB,and ET level in circulation,as well as increasing serum NO.It can help maintain the selective permeability function of blood vessel wall,prevent various macro-molecule (for example albumin,fibrinogen,and lipoprotein) leak through the blood vessel wall;preserve the normal negative charge on blood vessel wall;and control cell multiplication as well as the after- ward occurring function loss of blood vessel wall basement memberane,and extracellular matrix (ECM).",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The islet cell transplantation has provided a solid basis for diabetic therapy, but the insufficient donor limits its development. OBJECTIVE: Improving the method of isolating and purifying islets to observe the transplantation effect. DESIGN: A laboratory animal research. SETTING: Key Laboratory of Animal and Department of Cell Biology, China Medical University. MATERIALS: The experiment was carried out in the Key Laboratory of Animal and Department of Cell Biology in China Medical University between January and October in 2006. Donors were Wistar rats of either gender, weight 250-300 g; Acceptors were SD male rats, weight 180-220 g. The two kinds of rats were all common closed population and from the Experimental Animal Department of China Medical University (The Admission Number of Experimental Animal Institute is SYXK(LIAO)2003-0013). METHODS: \u2460Isolation and exaltation of islet cells as well as the functional evaluation of pancreas: After etherisation, the Wistar rat without fasting was executed. A little cut was made on the beginning of the biliary pore, then the little cut lumbar anesthesia ductus, which were connected with a 1-mm-diameter syringe and full of cold collagenase solution (1.5 g/L), was inserted directly to dilate pancreas thoroughly. The pancreatic gland was isolated and digested in the water of centrifuge, when doing that, 1 mol/L NaOH was put interruptedly into the centrifuge tube to keep the pH value of the solution at 7.8\u00b11.0. The rat pancreas purified by centrifugation of Ficoll density gradient. The identification of purified islets was evaluated by dithizone staining. The viability of islet was assessed by fluorescence staining of aridine orange and propidium iodide. The motility rate=the total number of live cells/(the total number of live cells + the total number of dead cells)\u00d7100%. Pancreatic activity was calculated: insulin release index=the level of insulin at the third hour (high concentration glucose)/the level of insulin at the second hour (low concentration glucose).\u2461The blood from vena caudalis of SD rat was sampled and measured the blood sugar after the intraperitoneal injection of streptozocin. The rat was diagnosed as DM when blood sugar was more than 16.7 mmol/L twice without fasting. The DM rats were divided into two groups, every group 8 rats. The experimental group rats were injected about 1 000 islet cells into the location below renal capsule, and the control group rats were injected the same volume of 1640 culture solution. Eight normal rats, whose glucose concentration \u2264 5.5 mmol/L, were taken randomly as normal controlled group. The blood sugar was measured every day after the surgery. The blood sugar less than 11.1 mmol/L without fasting was taken as the sign of successful islet transplantation. Intravenous sugar tolerance test was applied to the rats of normal control group, DM control group and experimental group 3 days after islet transplantation. Fasting for 12 hours before test, the blood sugar was measured at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Purity quotient, survival rate and activity of islet cells. RESULTS: All 24 SD acceptor rats were involved in the result analysis without miss.\u2460The total number of purified islets of one pancreas was (1 150\u00b1141) in well morphology. The purity of islets was more than 95%. The viability of islets was more than 98%.\u2461The insulin secretion response to glucose challenge in vitro showed the mean value of insulin in the low-glucose medium was (70.5\u00b16.9) mIU/L, while that of high-glucose medium was (321.4\u00b111.6) mIU/L, the insulin release index was 4.6\u00b10.52, that meant the beta cell of islet functioned well.\u2462The blood glucose level and the insulin level in plasma of the transplanted recipients restored to normal 3 days after transplantation. The survival period of transplanted islets was (6\u00b12) days. But there was not any change in the concentration of blood sugar in the control group (16.7 mmol/L). The intravenous glucose tolerance test showed the identical outcome between the islet transplantation group and the normal control group. CONCLUSION: There are high yield and high purify of islet cells in rats, which are isolated by in situ perfusion and purified by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation.",

Methods: A total of 60 patients with early diabetic nephropathy (albuminuria: 30 to 300 mg/24 h, male/female: 30/30, mean age: 51.23 years, mean course of disease: 12.9 years) were randomized equally into three groups: the routine treatment group, cozaar group (50 mg qd, po for 12 weeks) and sulodexid group (600 LSU qd, iv or im for 4 weeks, 250 LSU bid, po for 8 weeks). The levels of urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER), urea nitrogen and creatinine were determined. Results: After three months of treatment, the level of UAER was decreased significantly in both the sulodexide group and cozaar group (P<0.01), but not in the routine treatment group (P>0.05). The level of UAER was reduced by 34.04% and 33.62% in the cozaar group and the sulodexide group, respectively. Significant difference was noted in the level of UAER between the cozaar/sulodexide groups and the routine treatment group (P<0.01), but no significant difference was observed between cozaar group and sulodexide group (P>0.05). Conclusion: Sulodexide could decrease the level of UAER in patients with early diabetic nephropathy. It has similar efficacy to cozaar. \u00a9 2008 Editorial Board of Chin J Evid-based Med.",

Methods 60 hospitalized patients of acute conoary syndrome (ACS) are divided into two groups: one is older-age group (n=30),the other one is non-older-age group(n=30).Apply urgent coronary arteriongraphy and PCI aiming at the obstructive coronary artery to the patients of both groups. Apply another coronary arteriongraphy to the patients in the period of 3\uff5e6 months after PCI and evaluate the pathological changes of coronary artery by counting the number and the score of involved coronary artery.Results \u2460The average perfusion time is alike of the two groups. There is no obvious difference of the obstructive ratio between coronary artery of LAD,LCX and RCX;and the incident rate of multi-branches of coronary artery involved in older-age group is more than that in non-older-age group(P<0.01).\u2461 As far as the coronary arteriongraph in the acute period and the stage of recovery concerned,the score of involved coronary artery in older-age group is more than that in non-older-age group(P<0.05);the incident rate of restenosis in older-age group is more than that in non-older-age group significantly(P<0.01).Conclusions The incident rate of multi-branches involved of the patients with senile ACS is high;and the incident rate of restenosis of coronary artery in the stage of recovery is high after PCI in the period of acute myocardial infarction.",

        "abstract": "Objective We evaluated the effects of GRGDSP/7E3 to matrix metalloproteinase of Blood platelets-endothelial cells mRNA express.Methods The HUVECs was cultured in vitro. When the cells were sub-confluent,add serum free medium,resting platelets,\u03b1-thrombin-stimulated platelets,and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) into the 24-well plate respectively.After 60-minute coincubation under cell culture conditions,all platelets were removed by gentle washing.After an additional 6 hours of incubation of the endothelial cells,supernatant was aspirated and used for SDS-PAGE zymography and RT-PCR. HUVEC was analyzed by flow cytometry.Results HUVEC was incubated with \u03b1-thrombin-activated platelets. SDS-PAGE zymography revealed expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was only slightly induced by resting platelets. However,adhesion of activated platelets induced secretion of the 2 MMPs to a comparable extent as achieved by IL-1\u03b2.In addition,a second,lower band at 66kDa revealed MMP-2 activation on adhesion of activated platelets.Endothelial expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was significantly restrained by GRGDSP and mAbs anti-GP\u2161b/\u2162a(7E3).HUVEC incubation with \u03b1-thrombin-activated platelets induced mRNA expression of MMP-2,MT1-MMP,and uPAR comparable with the control group,but nonstimulated platelets did nothing. Expression of mRNA after administrating GRGDSP or 7E3 decreased greatly.Conclusions These data indicate that platelets can focus matrix-degrading activity to the particular sites of platelet adhesion at the vessel wall.GP\u2161b/\u2162a blockade may not only inhibit platelet aggregation at the vulnerable plaque and thereby prevent physical vessel occlusion but also may prevent platelet adhesion mediated inflammatory cascades leading to matrix degradation and plaque rupture.",

HERC4, one component, is a recently identified ubiqutin ligase. However, the expression level and function role of HERC4 in lung cancer remain unknown. Our objective was to investigate any correlation between HERC4 and development of lung cancer and its clinical significance.To determine HERC4 expression in lung cancer, an immunohistochemistry analysis of a tissue microarray containing samples of 10 lung normal tissues, 15 pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas, 45 squamous epithelial cancers and 50 adenocarcinomas was conducted. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was applied to obtain a cut-off point of 52.5%, above which the expression of HERC4 was regarded as \"positive\".On the basis of ROC curve analysis, positive expression of HERC4 was detected in 0/10 (0.0%) of lung normal tissues, in 4/15 (26.7%) of pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas, in 13/45 (28.9%) of squamous epithelial cancers and in 19/50 (38.0%) of adenocarcinomas. It showed that lung tumors expressed more HERC4 protein than adjacent normal tissues (\u03c72=4.675, p=0.031). Furthermore, HERC4 positive expression had positive correlation with pT status (\u03c72=44.894, p=0.000), pN status (\u03c72=43.628, p=0.000), histological grade (\u03c72=7.083, p=0.029) and clinical stage (\u03c72=72.484, p=0.000), but not age (\u03c72=0.910, p=0.340).Our analysis suggested that HERC4 is likely to be a diagnostic biomarker for lung cancer.",

PCR labeling was performed with the fluorescently labeled universal primer (Cy3-UP) whose sequence is designed according to the adaptor of the RD-PCR approaches. The labeled samples were then hybridized with the oligonucleotide microarray. Results Both single and multiple HPV DNA samples could be detected with oligonucleotides microarray, and the corresponding HPV subtypes were recognized as well.

This technique accelerates demonstration of anti-tumor drug mechanisms and discovery of new drug targets. This study was designed to investigate the differential gene expression of K562 cells after cytochalasin B treatment using cDNA microarray.Restriction display polymerase chain reaction (RD-PCR) products of 277 human genes were spotted on a glass slide in microarray. K562 cells grew in RPMI 1640 medium with 10 microg/ml cytochalasin B. After 24 hours, the total RNA was isolated from K562 cells, and mRNA was purified. Both mRNA from the treated K562 cells and the controlled K562 cells were reversely transcribed into cDNA and labeled with two different fluorescence dyes: Cy5 or Cy3, using a method of restriction digestion and PCR labeling (RD-PCR). The probes were hybridized to the cDNA microarrays. After high-stringent washing,the cDNA microarray was scanned for the fluorescent signals and showed difference between the two cells.Among the 277 target genes, 18 down-regulated genes were identified after cytochalasin B treatment.There is a consistent tendency toward lower-expressed genes in partial K562 cells after cytochalasin B treatment. Most down-regulated genes were correlated with cell proliferation, signal transduction, and transcription factor.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To explore the inhibitory effect of small interfering RNA(siRNA) targeting the X gene sequence of hepatitis B virus(HBV) in vitro on HBV replication and its antigen expression. Methods:siRNA targeting HBV X gene (HBVx) mRNA were designed and generated by PCR amplification and siRNA expression cassettes (SEC) methods. The product of PCR was transfected into HepG2.2.15 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent. The expression levels of HBVx mRNA at different transfection times were assayed by RT-PCR. At 24,48 and 72 hours after transfection,the levels of HBsAg and HBeAg in the cell culture supernatant were determined with ELISA kits. The HBV DNA in the supernatant was also determined by fluorogenic quantitative PCR(FQ-PCR). Results:The method of using SEC to generate siRNA was successfully. HBVx mRNA expression in the cells treated by HBVx-siRNA at 24,48 and 72 h were significantly reduced by about 57%,78% and 40% respectively. HBVx-siRNA had shown to efficiently and specifically inhibit the synthesis of surface antigen and e antigen of HBV,with inhibitory rate of 43% and 42%,peaking at 48 h after transfection. FQ-PCR also showed the replication of HBV DNA was reduced to lower levels. Conclusion:Results in this experiment demonstrates that the short interfering RNA targeting HBVx gene exert s robust inhibition on HBV replication and antigen expression.",

        "abstract": "It is known that chemoresistance is a major cause of treatment failure in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Substantial data indicate that the CD44 adhesion molecule is strongly expressed on AML blasts and that it can also inhibit apoptosis. Our study shows that drug resistance of the AML cell line HL60/ADM is due to overexpression of CD44. In an in vitro study, we knocked down CD44 in the HL60/ADM cell line using small interfering RNA (siRNA). Cell proliferation and the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cell apoptosis and intracellular ADM accumulation were detected by flow cytometry. Expression of CD44, Bcl-2, c-Myc were assayed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. The results indicate that the expression of CD44 in HL60/ADM cell line was much higher than in HL60 cell, and siRNA targeted CD44 (siRNA/CD44) could silence its expression in both mRNA and protein levels effectively. siRNA/CD44 substantially induces cell apoptosis, inhibits cell proliferation, enhances susceptibility to ADM and Ara-C, and at the same time increases intracellular ADM accumulation even reverses chemoresistance to ADM and Ara-C. Furthermore, by qRT-PCR and Western blot, we found that siRNA/CD44 decreases Bcl-2 and c-Myc synthesis. Our study provides a novel clue that CD44 plays a significant role in the chemoresistance of AML cells to Ara-C and ADM. Moreover, this provides a new direction to the approaches that combination therapy including targeting CD44 may overcome drug resistance and improve treatment effects.",

A total of 22 different specific gene fragments of HCV-1b ranging from 250 to 750 bp were isolated and sequenced, and these fragments were further used as probes in the microarray preparation. The diagnostic validity of the microarray method was evaluated after the washing and scanning process. The results of hybridization and sequence data analysis showed a significant specificity and sensitivity in the detection of HCV-1b RNA. The method of preparing microarray probes by construction of cDNA fragments library was effective, rapid, and simple; the optimized microarray was sensitive in the clinical detection of HCV-1b. The RD-PCR technique for the sample labeling was useful for significantly increasing the sensitivity of the assay. The cDNA microarray assay can be widely used in the clinical diagnosis of HCV-1b.",

Methods The total RNAs were extracted from K562 cells treated with ART for 24 hours and from the control K562 cells. All the RNAs were purified into mRNA and then converted to double-stranded cDNAs by reverse transcription. The cDNAs were labeled with a fluorescence dye Cy3 or Cy5 and hybridized to a human whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray. The change in the gene expression profiling of K563 cells following treatment with artemisinin was analyzed by using bioinformatics. Results A total of 238 differential genes were found,136 of which were up-regulated and 102 were down-regulated. Their biologic function was classified. Conclusions By analyzing the differential gene expressions with the whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray combined with the Panther software,we find that artemisinin induces the apoptosis of K562 cells by its cytotoxic effect on the cells and that the inhibitory effect of artemisinin on the cell growth is not evident.",

Methods The neural cell model of HSV-2 latent infection and reactivation in SH-SY5Y cells was established. PCR was used to authenticate the latency and reactivation of HSV-2 and then sequenced. siRNAs targeting the mRNA of HSV LAT ORF were designed and transfected into SH-SY5Y cells through Lipoectamine? 2000 reagent. The expression of LAT ORF mRNA before and after transfection was assayed by RT-PCR. cDNA microarray was prepared to study the changes of gene expression profiles of HSV-2 after inhibition of LAT ORF mRNA. Results The neural cell model system of HSV-2 latent infection and reactivation was established successfully in SH-SY5Y cells. PCR results of LAT and gG genes proved the latency and reactivation of virus. The mRNA expression of LAT ORF in the cells treated by HSV LAT ORF-siRNA at 24, 36 and 48h were significantly reduced by 39%, 51% and 60%, respectively. After hybridization, a statistic analysis following microarray scanning showed that 28 genes differentially expressed in the LAT-siRNA transfected cells as contrast to untransfected cells. An increase of expression was found in 4 genes and a decrease in 24. Conclusion LAT ORF plays an important role in the reactivation of HSV-2 latent infection, and it provides a foundation for understanding the regulatory mechanism of LAT in latent infection and reactivation of HSV-2.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To explore the effects of aquaporin-1 (AQP1) overexpression on erythroid differentiation and cell proliferation of human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells in vitro . Methods: The coding sequence of AQP 1 gene was amplified by PCR from Human Brain cDNA Libraries. The eukaryotic expression vector pBABE-puro-AQP1 was constructed and transfected into K562 cells. The K562 cells stably overexpressing AQP1 protein (K562-AQP1 cells) were selected. Real-time PCR and the immunocytochemical staining and Western blotting were used to examine the transcription level of AQP1 mRNA and the expression of AQP1 protein, respectively. The cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay, the expression of gamma-globin was detected by real-time PCR, and the haemoglobin content was detected by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. Then the effects of AQP1 overexpression on erythrod differentiation and proliferation of K562 cells were analyzed. Results: As compared with transfection with empty vector, the expression levels of AQP1 mRNA and protein in K562 cells transfected with pBABE-puro- AQP1 were both significantly increased (P < 0.01). The contents of gamma-globin and haemoglobin relating to erythroid differentiation were significantly increased in K562-AQP1 cells, while the cell proliferation rate was markedly reduced (P <0.05). Conclusion: The overexpression of AQP 1 gene can obviously promote the erythroid differentiation of K562 cells and inhibit the cell proliferation. It is suggested that AQP 1 may become a gene target of differentiation induction therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia. Copyright \u00a9 2012 by TUMOR.",

        "abstract": "To establish an experimental culture system of herpes simplex virus type II (HSV-2) latent infection and reactivation in SH-SY5Y cells.Changes of biological character were observed after 20, 40, 60, 80,100, 120 and 140 micromoL/L ACV were added into cell cultures, and also the morphological observation was detected with phase-contrast microscopy after HSV-2 was inoculated into SH-SY5Y cells using MOI of 0.1, 1, 10 and 100. The optimum condition of time and temperature was approached using temperature of 41 degrees C, 42 degrees C, 43 degrees C, 44 degrees C and 45 degrees C, and time of 0.5 h, 1.0 h, 1.5 h, 2.0 h and 2.5 h to induce HSV-2 reactivation. The optimum concentration of Forskolin was also decided using 25, 50, 75, 100 and 125 micromoL/L to activate the virus from latency. PCR was used to authenticate HSV-2 latent infection and reactivation. The morphological changes were observed when the virus was reactivated from latency.The optimum concentration of ACV was 60 micromoL/L to establish latency in SH-SY5Y cells. Suitable infective dose of HSV-2 was 1-10 MOI to construct latency and reactivation in SH-SY5Y cells. The time of virus latency in SH-SY5Y cells could reach up to 14 d. Heat stress of 43 degrees C, 1.5 h and 75 micromoL/L Forskolin were the optimum condition to induce virus reactivation. The morphologic changes in SH-SY5Y cells recurred by HSV-2: Cytopathic effects-were more and more obvious with time lasting from 24 h to 72 h after reactivation from latency. PCR and results of electrophoresis proved the cell model of latent infection and reactivation was set up successfully.The cell model system of HSV-2 latent infection and reactivation in SH-SY5Y cells was established. The research provided usefulness for study on HSV-2 of latency, reactivation and pathogenic mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Pin2/TRF1 binding protein X1 (PinX1) has been identified as an endogenous telomerase inhibitor and a major haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene. Increasing evidence suggests that reduced expression of PinX1 plays a key role in tumorigenesis. However, the PinX1 expression status and its correlation with the clinicopathological features in prostate cancer (PCa) have not been investigated.PinX1 mRNA and protein expression in PCa and adjacent normal prostate tissues were evaluated by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. The clinicopathological significance of PinX1 was investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis on a PCa tissue microarray (TMA). The cut-off score for positive expression of PinX1 was determined by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The correlation between PinX1 expression and clinicopathological features of PCa was analyzed by Chi-square test.Reduced expression of PinX1 mRNA and protein was observed in the majority of PCa, compared with their paired adjacent normal prostate tissues. When PinX1 positive expression percentage was determined to be above 60% (area under ROC curve\u2009=\u20090.833, P\u2009=\u20090.000), positive expression of PinX1 was observed in 100% (8/8) of normal prostate tissues and 32.5% (13/40) of PCa tissues by IHC. Reduced expression of PinX1 in patients was correlated with advanced clinical stage (\u03c7(2)\u2009=\u200910.230, p\u2009=\u20090.017), high Gleason score (\u03c7(2)\u2009=\u20094.019, p\u2009=\u20090.045), positive regional lymph node metastasis (\u03c7(2)\u2009=\u200910.852, p\u2009=\u20090.004) and distant metastasis (\u03c7(2)\u2009=\u20097.965, p\u2009=\u20090.005).Our findings suggest that reduced expression of PinX1 is correlates to progressive features in patients with PCa and may serve as a potential marker for diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Aquaporin genes are differentially expressed in primitive versus definitive erythropoiesis. Our previous research results showed that over-expression of aquaporin-1 (AQP1) gene greatly promotes the erythroid differentiation of erythroleukemia K562 cells, using benzidine staining and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis for representative erythroid-related genes, including \u03b3-globin. But the molecular mechanisms underlying erythroid-specific gene regulation remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that AQP1 induced hemoglobins expression and altered erythroid gene expression by microarray analysis in K562 cells. The retroviral expression vector of AQP1 (pBABE-puro-AQP1) was constructed and infected K562 cells to establish a stable AQP1 over-expression cell line (K562-AQP1). AQP1 over-expression effectively inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell growth arrest in G1 phase of K562 cells. Then microarray profile was applied to analyze the differentially expressed genes which involved the mechanism of AQP1 in erythroid differentiation induction. The DAVID functional annotation clustering tool was used to identify biological functions enriched with the differentially expressed genes (n\u2009=\u2009466 genes) and to group genes into clusters based on their functional similarity. Significant enrichment of genes involved in \"oxygen transporter activity\" (p\u2009=\u20093.8E-7) including hemoglobins (HBD, HBG, HBB, HBE1, and HBQ1), HEMGN, and EBP42 were validated by qRT-PCR. Moreover, silencing of HEMGN by RNA interference in K562-AQP1 cells resulted in down-regulation of these genes. These data provide a better understanding of the role of AQP1 in erythroid differentiation, by promoting HEMGN induction and other potential signaling pathways associated with hemoglobin induction.",

        "abstract": "To explore the role of aquaporin-1 (AQP1) gene in erythroid differentiation of erythroleukemia K562 cells induced by retinoic acid (RA).K562 cells were cultured in the presence of 1 \u00b5mol/L RA for varying lengths of time, and \u03b3-globin mRNA expression and hemoglobin content in the cells were detected by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and ultraviolet spectrophotometry, respectively, to evaluate the erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to examine AQP1 expression in the cells following RA treatment. A retroviral expression vector of AQP1 small interfering RNA (pSUPER-retro-puro-shAQP1) was constructed and transfected into K562 cells to establish a K562 cell line with stable AQP1 down-regulation (K562-shAQP1), in which the changes in \u03b3-globin and hemoglobin expressions after RA treatment were detected.RA treatment significantly increased \u03b3-globin and hemoglobin expressions in K562 cells (P<0.01), causing also significantly enhanced AQP1 mRNA and protein expressions over time (P<0.01). Transfection with the recombinant plasmids pSuper-retro-puro-shAQP1 resulted in stable AQP1 suppression in K562 cells (P<0.01), which showed markedly reduced \u03b3-globin and hemoglobin expressions after RA induction as compared to the control K562 cells (P<0.01).K562 cells show a significant increase of AQP1 expression after RA-induced erythroid differentiation, and suppression of AQP1 expression can partially block the effect of RA, suggesting the important role of AQP1 in RA-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells.",

        "abstract": "Objective To develop the cDNA microarray for the combined detection of hepatitis virus, and to study the feasibility of applying the microarray in clinical setting. Methods For the small and simple genome of HBV and HDV, the specific primers of PCR were designed with Primer Premier 5.0 program according to the conserved region of HBV and HDV, and 10 and 4 gene fragments were obtained respectively, which could be used as the probes of gene chip. As for the complex genome of HCV, the technique of restriction display PCR (RD-PCR) was employed. Some of gene fragments were selected which were comparatively more specific and sensitive as microarray probes. In order to explore the experimental conditions of microarray in vitro detection, three types of gene chip were prepared successively including HBV and HDV simultaneous detection, HCV detection and modified HCV detection. Results The hybridized signals on the gene chip showed that the effect in detection was satisfactory. Through the prepared gene chips mentioned above, some probes with good quality were selected and the microarray was prepared for HBV, HCV and HDV simultaneous detection. The diagnostic capability of the microarray was evaluated following the washing and scanning steps. Linearity: Serial dilutions of the target DNA or cDNA showed that a strong linear relationship existed between the various concentrations of target DNA or cDNA and the fluorescence intensities obtained from microarray assay (r=0.990 2, r=0.992 1, r=0.981 9), and that the detection range for the microarray was from 104 to 1011 copies/ml. Specificity: Samples from other viruses such as YFV, JET and DV were also subjected to the test and the results were all negative. Reproducibility: The reproducibility of this assay system was evaluated by repeated measurements, and the within-run coefficient of validation of HBV, HCV and HDV were 7.1%, 7.2% and 6.6%, respectively, while the between-run coefficient of validation was 7.9%, 8.2% and 7.6%, respectively. Accuracy: By using the BLAST and the GenBank database, the identity of the obtained sequences including 16 fragments of PCR, 24 RD fragments of HCV and some positive serum samples were verified, each sequenced product was confirmed to be a genome fragment of expected size. In order to fulfill the request of clinical diagnosis, a modified protocol for microarray detection was established. This new protocol consisted of two hours of hybridization, omitting the steps of prehybridization and purification of samples, and the hybridization temperature was elevated from 42\u2103 to 52\u2103, et al. The whole protocol could be completed in less than 8 hours. 98, 42 and 5 serum samples from hepatitis B, C and D patients and 130 samples from healthy people were analyzed, respectively, by microarray assay and real-time PCR (Taqmam method). There was a significant correlation between the results of these assays (HBV, r=0.985 4 and HCV, r=0.958 2, P<0.01). The sensitivity of HBV, HCV and HDV detection by microarray method were 85.7%, 76.2% and 80%, respectively, and the specificity were 96.7%, 95.0% and 100%, respectively. Conclusion The specificity and sensitivity for the simultaneous detection of hepatitis virus are satisfactory. It is clear that the microarray is expected to be a useful diagnostic method in the clinical laboratory.",

        "abstract": "Excision repair crossing-complementing group 2 (ERCC2), also called xeroderma pigmentosum complementary group D (XPD), plays a crucial role in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. Previous epidemiological studies have reported associations between ERCC2 polymorphisms and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) risk, but the results have remained controversial.We conducted this meta- analysis based on eligible case-control studies to investigate the role of two ERCC2 polymorphisms (Lys751Gln and Asp312Asn) in determining susceptibility to NHL. Ten case-control studies from several electronic databases were included in our study up to August 14, 2014. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed- or random-effects models to estimate the association strength.The combined results based on all studies did not show any association between Lys751Gln/Asp312Asn polymorphisms and NHL risk for all genetic models. Stratified analyses by histological subtype and ethnicity did not indicate any significant association between Lys751Gln polymorphism and NHL risk. However, a significant reduced risk of NHL was found among population-based studies (Lys/Gln versus Lys/Lys: OR=0.87, 95% CI=0.77-0.99, P=0.037) but not hospital-based studies. As for Asp312Asn polymorphism, there was no evidence for the association between this polymorphism and the risk of NHL in all subgroup analyses.This meta-analysis suggests that there may be no association between Lys751Gln/Asp312Asn polymorphism and the risk of NHL and its two subtypes, whereas ERCC2 Lys751Gln heterozygote genotype may provide protective effects against the risk of NHL in population-based studies. Therefore, large-scale and well-designed studies are needed to clarify the effects of haplotypes, gene-gene, and gene-environment interactions on these polymorphisms and the risk of NHL and its different histological subtypes in an ethnicity specific population.",

        "abstract": "Sleep disorders are a common symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) and they significantly impair the sleep quality of the PD patients. However, there is no conclusive evidence to support the relation between PD and the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The purpose of this meta-analysis review is to evaluate the association between PD and the prevalence of OSA.A comprehensive literature search was conducted on PubMed and Embase through July 2013. Only studies that referred to PD and the prevalence of OSA and that met the selection criteria were included in the analysis. The odds ratios (ORs) were used to evaluate the relationship of PD and the prevalence of OSA by the fixed-effect model.Five eligible studies were analyzed in this study including 322 cases and 6,361 controls. The pooled-analysis showed the OR to be 0.60 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.44 to 0.81, P = 0.001) and I(2) = 0.0% (\u03c7(2) = 3.90, P = 0.420) in the fixed-effect model.Although we only included five small sample studies that indicated high homogeneity in the heterogeneity test, the results suggest that there is a significant negative association between PD and the prevalence of OSA; PD patients generally have a reduced prevalence of OSA. According to our analysis, these results are primarily due to the lower BMI of PD patients when compared with the general population controls.",

The gene microarray probes were prepared by RD-PCR technique, then the microarray of gene expression map was constructed; the morphologic changes of K562 cells were observed under phase-contrast microscopy before and after treatment with STI571; the apoptosis of K562 cells treated with STI571 was assayed by MTT method; the expression level of genes was analyzed by self-made microarray. The results indicated that after the treatment of STI571 for 24 hours, in K562 cells appeared major morphological changes, which included nuclear shrinkage, membrane bleb and scattered apoptotic bodies. DNA gel electrophoresis also showed that the typical \"DNA ladder\" phenomena existed in the treated group. After hybridization, detection and analysis with microarray method, expression of 9 genes significantly down-regulated and expression of 4 genes up-regulated. These differentially expressed genes included cell cycle related genes, cell metabolizing pathway related genes, signal transduction and transcription regulation related genes and antiapoptosis genes. It is concluded that STI571 can effectively inhibit the K562 cell growth and induce K562 cell apoptosis. The genes screened from this microarray offer new information for exploration of pathogenesis of K562 cell malignant transformation and shows abundant potential targets for the treatment of CML.",

        "title": "Increased expression of Six1 correlates with progression and prognosis of prostate cancer.",
        "abstract": "Sineoculis homeobox homolog 1 (Six1), normally a developmentally restricted transcriptional regulator, is frequently dysregulated in mutiple cancers. Increasing evidences show that overexpression of Six1 plays a key role in tumorigenesis. However, the Six1 expression status and its relationship with the clinicopathological characteristics in prostate cancer were unclear. In this study, the mRNA and protein levels of Six1 in prostate cancer tissues and normal prostate tissues were evaluated. The clinicopathological significance of Six1 was investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on a prostate cancer tissue microarray. The cut-off score for high expression of Six1 was determined by the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The correlation between Six1 protein expression and clinicopathological characteristics of prostate cancer was analyzed by Chi-square test. Increased expression of Six1 protein was observed in the majority of prostate cancer, compared with their paired adjacent normal prostate tissues. When Six1 high expression percentage was determined to be above 55\u00a0% (area under ROC curve\u2009=\u20090.881, P\u2009=\u20090.000), high expression of Six1 was observed in 55.6\u00a0% (80/144) of prostate cancer tissues and low expression of Six1 was observed in all normal prostate tissues by IHC. Increased expression of Six1 in patients was correlated with high histological grade (\u03c72\u2009=\u200958.651, P\u2009=\u20090.00), advanced clinical stage (\u03c72\u2009=\u200957.330, P\u2009=\u20090.000), high Gleason score (\u03c72\u2009=\u200963.480, P\u2009=\u20090.000), high primary tumor grade (\u03c72\u2009=\u200957.330, P\u2009=\u20090.000) and positive regional lymph node metastasis (\u03c72\u2009=\u200919.294, P\u2009=\u20090.000). Furthermore, univariate and multivariate survival analysis suggested that Six1 was an independent prognostic indicator for overall survival (P\u2009<\u20090.05). This study suggests that Six1 could be served as an additional biomarker in identifying prostate cancer patients at risk of tumor progression, might potentially be used for predicting survival outcome of patients with prostate cancer.

The induction of EMT by Six1 has been described as a common mode of cancer progression, which could promote breast cancer migration and invasion. In the study, we found that miR-204-5p could suppress the migration and invasion of breast cancer cell lines. Since overexpression of Six1 promote EMT, we identified a mechanism by which miR-204-5p inhibited the EMT by downregulating the Six1, which was mediated by a conserved miR-204-5p seed-matching sequence in the 3\u2032-UTR of Six1 mRNA. We also identified that upregulation of Six1 could downregulate miR-204-5p expression, affecting the migration and invasion of breast cancer cell lines. In conclusion, the frequent upregulation of Six1 and/or downregulation of miR-204-5p in breast cancer may shift the equilibrium of these reciprocal regulations and lock breast cancer cells in the mesenchymal state.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been shown by certain studies to be associated with diabetes mellitus (DM); however, the results of these studies were controversial. For that reason, a meta-analysis of the literature was performed in order to determine the association between HBV infection and the prevalence of DM more accurately. The PubMed, Embase, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wan Fang databases, as well as the Chinese Science and Technology Journal Database, were searched for literature published until June 2014. The reference lists of all relevant articles were also searched. The summary odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated based on a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on study type and region for the purpose of assessing the factors that could potentially affect the outcome. A total of 15 eligible studies (in 14 articles) were selected for the meta-analysis, involving 12,974,690 HBV-infected patients and 231,776,232 controls. The OR for the prevalence of DM was 1.33 (95% CI, 1.09\u20131.62; P=0.005) between the patients with HBV infection and the controls. The subgroup analysis based on study type revealed a significantly higher prevalence of DM in the HBV-infected group than that in the control group in both case-control (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.08\u20133.30; P=0.025) and cross-sectional (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.04\u20131.90; P=0.027) studies. The subgroup analysis based on region revealed a significantly higher prevalence of DM in the HBV-infected group than in the control group in the Asia-Pacific region (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.08\u20132.58; P=0.022). Compared with uninfected patients, the pooled results suggest that HBV-infected patients have a higher risk of developing DM; however, given the fact that this is a meta-analysis of observational studies, further randomized controlled trials are required in order to reach a more accurate conclusion.",

        "abstract": "Sushi domain containing 2 (SUSD2) has been identified as a gene encoding an 822-amino acid protein, which contains a transmembrane domain and functional domains inherent to adhesion molecules. Previous studies have reported that increased expression of SUSD2 has a critical role in tumorigenesis in human breast cancer. However, to the best of our knowledge, SUSD2 expression status and its correlation with the clinicopathological features of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have not previously been investigated. In the present study, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used to evaluate SUSD2 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression in NSCLC and adjacent normal lung tissues. The clinicopathological significance of SUSD2 was investigated by immunohistochemical analysis of an NSCLC tissue microarray. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to determine the cut-off score for positive expression of SUSD2. Furthermore, the correlation between SUSD2 expression and the clinicopathological features of NSCLC was analyzed by \u03c7(2) test. The results revealed that SUSD2 mRNA (P<0.0001) and protein (P<0.0001) expression levels were significantly decreased in NSCLC tissues compared with those of adjacent normal tissues. When the SUSD2 positive expression percentage was determined to be >47.5% (area under ROC curve, 0.799; P<0.000), positive expression of SUSD2 was observed in 100% (32/32) of normal lung tissues and 55% (88/160) of NSCLC tissues by immunohistochemistry (\u03c7(2)=21.160; P<0.000). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the reduced SUSD2 protein levels in cancer tissues were positively correlated with poor histological grade (\u03c7(2)=41.764; P<0.000), advanced clinical stage (\u03c7(2)=10.790; P=0.013), higher pT (\u03c7(2)=9.070; P=0.028) and positive regional lymph node metastasis (\u03c7(2)=15.399; P=0.002). In conclusion, these data suggest that the reduced expression of SUSD2 is associated with the progression of NSCLC and may have a role in the pathogenesis of NSCLC.",

        "abstract": "The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of aquaporin-1 (AQP1) level and intratumoral microvessel density (IMD) on the clinicopathological features of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The AQP1 expression levels, IMD and AQP1/IMD ratios in patients with HCC were measured using a semi-quantitative immunohistochemical technique. The association between these features and clinicopathological variables were evaluated. The prognostic impact of AQP1 and IMD on overall survival (OS), and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) of HCC patients was investigated retrospectively. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. A total of 90 cases of HCC were included in the present study. AQP1 was markedly expressed in the membranes of microvessels and small vessels, but seldom in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Blood vessels in the tumors were markedly stained by anti-cluster of differentiation 34 antibody. AQP1 expression and IMD was significantly correlated with tumor size, histologic grade, Child-Pugh classification, microvascular invasion and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage (P<0.05). Concurrently, for the 5-year DFS and OS, a larger tumor size, poorly differentiated histological grade, B and C Child-Pugh classification, presence of microvascular invasion, high TNM stage, a high AQP1 expression and a high IMD were significant risk factors for mortality. Multivariate analysis revealed that TNM stage and IMD were independent unfavorable prognostic markers for 5-year DFS (P=0.049 and P=0.025, respectively) and OS (P=0.043 and P=0.042, respectively). These data suggest that high AQP1 expression and IMD are associated with tumor progression and prognosis in HCC. The IMD level may serve as an independent indicator for the 5-year DFS and OS.",

        "abstract": "Human Pinx1 protein, associated with shelterin proteins, is widely revealed as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. Growing evidence has manifested the deregulation of PinX1 in distinct cancers. Nonetheless, the loss status of PinX1 and its diagnostic, prognostic and clinicopathological significance in Basal-like breast cancer are still unclear. In the present study, the PinX1 expression levels of breast cancer tissues were investigated by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting assays. Then immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to detect PinX1 expression on a tissue microarray. The optimal threshold for PinX1 positivity was determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. To clarify the probable role of PinX1 in BLBC, the PinX1 knockout and stably over-expressed MDA-MB-231 cell lines were constructed by the CRISPR-Cas9 system and gene transfection. The association of PinX1 expression with cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells were observed by CCK-8 assay, wound healing assay, transwell assay, flow cytometric analysis and immunoblotting of the cleaved caspase-3 protein level. Our results showed that both PinX1 mRNA and protein expression were downregulated in breast cancer tissues (P<0.05). In IHC analysis, the optimal cut-off parameter for PinX1 positive expression was 62.5% (the AUC was 0.749, P<0.01). PinX1 positivity was 76.9% (10/14) in luminal subtypes, 50% (5/10) in Her2-enriched breast cancer and 27.3% (9/33) in basal-like subtypes. Besides, in 59 invasive ductal breast carcinomas, PinX1 expression was inversely related to histology grade (P<0.05) while it was positively associated with PR status (P<0.05) and ER status (P<0.05). These results indicated that low expression of PinX1 correlated with aggressive clinicopathological significance of breast cancer, especially in the basal-like subtype. Besides, we identified that overexpression of PinX1 inhibited the proliferation rates and migration ability and increased the apoptosis rates of BLBC. Our findings demonstrated that low expression of PinX1 was associated with malignant behaviors in basal-like subtype of breast cancer. PinX1 is likely a feasible biomarker and molecular target of BLBC.",

This study aimed to investigate the expression and clinical significance of TMEM40 in TSCC and its roles in TSCC cells. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to detect the expression levels of TMEM40 in 60 tongue tissue samples. Furthermore, TMEM40 was overexpressed and inhibited in two TSCC cell lines by transfection with pEZ\u2011M98\u2011TMEM40 plasmid or TMEM40 small interfering RNA, respectively. Cell Counting Kit\u20118 and colony formation assays were used to investigate the effects of TMEM40 on cell proliferation and colony formation ability, respectively. Flow cytometry was performed to determine cell apoptosis and cycle conditions of transfected cells. Wound\u2011healing and Transwell assays were processed to explore the effects of TMEM40 on cell migration and invasion, respectively. The results indicated that TMEM40 expression levels were significantly increased in TSCC tissues compared with adjacent normal tongue tissues (P<0.01). Clinicopathological analysis revealed that TMEM40 expression was positively correlated with pathological TNM (pTNM) status (P<0.05), histological grade (P<0.001) and clinical stage (P<0.01), but not with sex or age. Results of cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion assays indicated that when TMEM40 had been successfully overexpressed or knocked down in CAL27 and SCC9 TSCC cell lines, cell growth and invasion increased in the TMEM40 overexpressing cells, while they decreased in TMEM40\u2011knockdown cells. Furthermore, experiments revealed that TMEM40 knockdown resulted in increased levels of p53 and Bax, and decreased levels of MMP\u20119, which indicated that TMEM40 regulated cell apoptosis and migration via involvement of p53, Bax and MMP\u20119 in TSCC cells. Our findings indicated that increased expression of TMEM40 contributed to progressive features of TSCC via regulation of p53, Bax and MMP\u20119.",

        "abstract": "The adhesion of tumor cells with platelets is important in the process of tumor metastasis. A huge work has indicated that anti-adhesion is an effective strategy for metastasis inhibition. In this article, we assess the role of platelet integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in adhesion of melanoma cells to platelets and the effects of heparin and modified heparins on the adhesion in vitro and in vivo. We show that platelet integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is involved in the interaction of human melanoma A375 cells with platelets, and the high affinity epitope resides on the \u03b1IIb subunit rather than \u03b23 subunit. Heparin sulfate-like proteoglycans on tumor cell surface are implicated in the adhesion of A375 cells to integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23. We also show that RO-heparin, CR-heparin, N-2,3-DS-heparin and 2,3-O-DS-heparin can significantly inhibit A375 cells binding to the CHO cells expressing integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 under static and flow conditions, and remarkably inhibit the adhesion of A375 cells to the immobilized platelet layers under flow conditions. We find that A375 cells and B16F10 cells are arrested in the pulmonary vessels and adhered to platelets, and the initial interaction of tumor cells with platelets in lung vessel and long-term establishment of metastatic foci can be inhibited by heparin as well as CR-heparin and N-2,3-DS-heparin. These data suggest that modified heparins can inhibit tumor cellplatelet interaction mediated by platelet integrin \u03b1 IIb\u03b23 and modified heparins may be a potential substitute for heparin in inhibiting tumor metastasis. \u00a9 2009 UICC.",

        "abstract": "The interaction between platelets and tumor cells is critical for the hematogenous metastasis of tumor cells. We recently reported that fibrinogen was capable of bridging and enhancing the interaction of platelets and tumor cells under conditions of physical shear force. In the present study, we aimed to detect the effects of 8 chemically modified heparins on the binding of fibrinogen to platelets or tumor cells using flow cytometry assays, as well as the fibrinogen-bridged adhesion of platelets and tumor cells using flow chamber assays. The results showed that fibrinogen binds to platelets and tumor cells in a \u03b23 integrin-dependent manner and bridges the adhesion between platelets and tumor cells. Heparin and certain chemically modified heparins, including borohydride-reduced (RO)-, carboxyl-reduced (CR)- and 2-O, 3-O-desulfated (2/3ODS)-heparins, inhibited the \u03b23 integrin-dependent adhesion of fibrinogen to platelets or tumor cells, and consequently blocked the fibrinogen-bridged indirect adhesion of platelets to tumor cells. These data indicate that chemically modified heparins should be potential inhibitors for the fibrinogen-bridged indirect adhesion of platelets and tumor cells, which provides a novel explanation of the anti-adhesion property of heparin and proposes a new anti-metastatic target for cancer treatment.",

The results show that the sulfochitosans exhibit inhibitory activity in this general order: heparin > N-sulfated/6-O-sulfated chitosan \u2265 3-O,6-O-sulfated chitosan > 6-O-sulfated chitosan > N-sulfated chitosan.

Smith degradation, methylation analyses, GC/MS analyses and NMR analyses were used for the structure analyses of SB1-1. The results reveal that SB1-1 has a lower branched structure. The main chain is composed of GalA and Gal; the inner part is \u03b1-1,4-linked-GalA; the border is 1,4-linked-Gal. Some of the 1,4-linked-GalA and 1,4-linked-Gal residues are substituted at O6. On an average, there is one branch for every ten hexose residues. The side chain is composed of 1,6-linked-Gal and 1,3,6-linked-Gal. The nonreduced end is composed of Rha, Ara and Gal.

However, little information is available about the specific oligosaccharide structures of heparin in recognition by P-selectin. Two chemically modified heparins, CR-heparin and SCR-heparin were prepared, to explore if such heparin derivatives can reduce the P-selectin-mediated A375 tumor cell adhesion. The results indicated that CR-heparin with low anticoagulant activity could significantly inhibit the P-selectin-mediated A375 tumor cell adhesion, demonstrating that 6-carboxyl group of the glucuronic acid in heparin may not be crucial for recognizing by P-selectin. In contrast, SCR-heparin reduced the inhibiting activity dramatically, suggesting that the recognition of P-selectin to heparin depend on not only densities of negative charge. These results provide valuable experimental evidence for clarifying the molecular mechanism of P-selectin-mediated tumor cell adhesion.",

The mechanism of inhibition by the heparin derivatives in part accounts for the interference of tumor cell-platelet interaction mediated by P-selectin.In the present study, we demonstrated that both heparin and chemically modified heparins inhibited the adhesion of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells to P-selectin under static or flow conditions in vitro.Flow cytometric analysis with the heparan sulfate-specific monoclonal antibody revealed that both NSCLC cells express heparan sulfate-like proteoglycans. Furthermore, heparinase treatment impaired P-selectin binding, indicating that heparan sulfate-like proteoglycans on the tumor cell surface are implicated in the adhesion of NSCLC cells to P-selectin.These findings suggest that some chemically modified heparins with low anticoagulant activity may deserve further testing in the experimental NSCLC treatment protocols.",

        "abstract": "The functions of platelets and fibrinogen in protecting tumor cells from natural killer cytotoxicity have been discussed for more than 20 years. However, their exact roles and relationships in the process are still not clear. In this study, we show that tumor cells prefer to adhere to fibrinogen than to platelets, and fibrinogen can enhance the adhesion of tumor cells to platelets. Beta3 integrin plays an important role in the adhesion of B16F10 to platelets enhanced by fibrinogen. In the presence of thrombin, fibrinogen forms dense fibrin(ogen) layers around tumor cells. Tumor cells can induce platelets to aggregate and form thrombin. Platelets, as well as thrombin, can help fibrinogen protect tumor cells from lethal contact with natural killer cells and natural killer cytotoxicity. Hirudin, a specific inhibitor of thrombin, can reverse the effect of platelets on fibrinogen in blocking natural killer cytotoxicity. Our results suggest that fibrinogen helps platelets to adhere to tumor cells, and platelets in turn promote more fibrinogen to aggregate around tumor cells by forming thrombin. They facilitate each other in protecting tumor cells from natural killer cytotoxicity.",

        "abstract": "The accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in tumor-bearing hosts is a hallmark of tumor-associated inflammation, which is thought to be a barrier to immunosurveillance. Multiple factors secreted by tumor cells and tumor stromal cells are reported to be involved in promoting the expansion of MDSCs. Here, we showed that the subcutaneous inoculation of tumor cells and intravenous injection of tumor-conditioned medium increased the number of MDSCs. Subsequent investigation elucidated that CXCL1 and CXCL2, which were originally characterized as the chemokines of neutrophils, specifically promoted the expansion of mo-MDSCs, a subtype of MDSCs, in the presence of GM-CSF. Depletion of CXCL1 or CXCL2 in B16F10 cells or in B16F10-bearing mice noticeably decreased the generation of mo-MDSCs in bone marrow. Moreover, we found that, in addition to the tumor cells, the tumor-infiltrated CD11b myeloid cells also expressed CXCL1 and CXCL2. Furthermore, the CXCL1 and CXCL2-induced increase of mo-MDSCs was not correlated with the chemotaxis, proliferation or apoptosis of mo-MDSCs. These findings illuminate a novel role of CXCL1 and CXCL2 in promoting mo-MDSC generation by favoring the differentiation of bone marrow cells in tumor-bearing conditions, which suggests that inhibition of CXCL1 and CXCL2 could decrease mo-MDSC generation and improve host immunosurveillance.

Changes in the prevalence of visual impairment due to blinding trachoma were analyzed while accounting for other factors including gender, age and residence (urban vs. rural).In 1987, blinding trachoma ranked second among the eight major visual impairment causes assessed with a prevalence of 172.9 (95% CI: 152.2-196.6) per 100,000, while in 2006 it ranked eighth with a prevalence of 58.1 (95% CI: 45.5-73.0) per 100,000. The prevalence in 2006 decreased significantly compared to 1987 in both rural and urban areas, as well as in both genders. Furthermore, in both 1987 and 2006, visual impairment due to blinding trachoma tended to be concentrated among individuals over 40, although it was also seen in young people.In the past 20 years, the prevalence and percentage of visual impairment due to blinding trachoma was significantly reduced in Sichuan province, and we anticipate a further decrease in the future.",

The age-adjusted prevalence of major causes of VI and the prevalence stratified by age in each cause were calculated and compared. The association between age and each cause of VI was also analyzed.Retinal disease increased and became the second leading cause of VI in 2006 while blinding trachoma decreased markedly. Cataract and non-trachomatous corneal diseases were among the leading causes of VI in both years. We found associations between age and causes of VI, with age showing the strongest association with cataract and relatively lower associations with other causes.In the last two decades, dramatic changes occurred in the major causes of VI with significantly increased retinal disease and decreased blinding trachoma. Aging of the population might be an important factor accounting for the changed trends of VI. Understanding the prevalence of VI, its major causes and trends over time can assist in prioritizing and developing effective interventional strategies and monitoring their impact.",

METHODS: According to the second national sampling survey of the disabled, our sampling was carried out by means of multi-level, multi-phase, whole group and probability. We investigated 38 counties/cities, 152 towns, 304 communities, 40 351 households, total 125 641 people (male 62 735, account for 49.93%; female 62 906 ,50.07%. urban people 38 125, account for 30.34%;rural people 87 516, 69.66% ). RESULTS: There are 966 (0.77%) blind persons while 1 513 low-vision (1.20%) people; the proportion of low-vision to blindness is 1.56. The main cause of visual disability is cataract (55.71%), which ranks the first; retinopathy (9.52%) is the second while corneal disease (6.49%) is the third. The others are as follows: optic nerve disease(4th,6.01%), hereditary/congenital (5th, 4.72%), glaucoma(6th, 3.87%), ametropia (7th, 3.19%), trauma(8th, 2.66%), miscellaneous(9th, 2.62%),trachoma(10th, 1.86%), amblyopia(11th, 1.74%), unknown(12th, 1.33%) and toxication (ranks the last, 0.28%). The number of people suffering visual disability is increasing with the increase of age, especially the group over 50 years old (occupying 17.42% of visual disability), while the group over 70 years old (44.81%) is of the highest proportion in visual disability. The majority of visual disability are farmers living in the countryside. The incidence of visual disability in rural area (2.22%) is markedly higher than that in city (1.40%). CONCLUSION: The main cause of visual disability is senile eye disease (senile cataract, age-related retinal diseases ,etc). The focus of blindness prevention should be put in the rural area. \ue624",

Participants underwent a comprehensive eye examination, including standardized visual acuity (VA) tests using logarithm of the minimum angle resolution charts. Prevalence was age- and gender-standardized to the 2000 China Census.Population-weighted prevalence of blindness was 0.77% (95%CI: 0.72-0.82, n=966) and low vision was 1.22% (95%CI: 1.14-1.27, n=1513). Overall, the prevalence of visual disability was 1.40% in the urban population, and 2.22% in the rural population (P<0.01). Cataract was the leading cause of visual disability (55.7%, n=1381), and was of similar frequency in both urban and rural populations. Retinal disease was the second leading cause(9.7%, n=236), but was more common in urban than in rural participants (34.3% vs 2.7%, P<0.01). Corneal disease accounted for 6.5% (n=161) of cases of visual disability, and was more common in the rural population (7.2% vs 3.9%, P=0.006).We estimate that 1.72 million people suffer from visual disability within Sichuan province, of which 525000 are blind, the focus of blindness prevention should be in rural area.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To investigate the influence of Astragalus Injection on morphology,cell cycle and oxidative stress of rat's glomerular mesangial cells(GMC) cultured with advanced glycation end products(AGEs). METHODS: GMC were incubated in culture medium containing AGEs in the presence of Astragalus Injection and aminoguanidin for 48 h.At the same time,the normal and control groups were established.Then the cultured GMC was stained by mixed fluorescence liquid and observed under fluorescence microscope.Cell cycle of GMC was analyzed using flowcytometry.The activity of SOD\u3001MDA and GSH-PX in GMC supernatant were measured by test kit.The level of ROS was detected by flowcytometry. RESULTS: Morphology analysis showed that the morphology and structure of normal GMC were normal.The structure of most cells in AGEs was unclear,cell counts increased markedly and they grew intensively.Cell cycle analysis showed that cell percentage of S phase increased and G_0/G_1 reduced.The level of ROS,MDA remarkably increased,and SOD,GSHPX activity reduced.Whereas Astragalus Injection was added,cell morphology tended to be basically normal and cell counts decreased,the percentage of S phase also decreased.The level of ROS,MDA and the SOD,GSH-PX activity restored in comparison with the control groups. CONCLUSION: Astragalus Injection can prevent GMC from lesion caused by AGEs.Astragalus Injection may protect GMC from retarding the progression of diabetic nepropathy by partially inhibiting the occurrence of oxidative stress.",

        "abstract": "The modifying effects of nonylphenol and genistein on cancer induction were assessed in a multi-organ carcinogenesis model in male F344 rats initially treated with five different carcinogens. In experiment 1 rats received 250 or 25 ppm nonylphenol, or 250 or 25 ppm genistein in their diet for 28 weeks. The total incidences of adenomas and carcinomas in the lungs of animals treated with nonylphenol and genistein were significantly higher than in the control group. 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeling indices, reflecting cell proliferation, were also significantly elevated in the lungs of rats given 250 and 25 ppm nonylphenol and 250 ppm genistein. In experiment 2, rats were treated with nonylphenol or genistein at concentrations of 250 ppm after DHPN initiation. In the lung, formation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, a marker of oxygen radical-mediated DNA damage, was significantly increased. These results indicate that nonylphenol and genistein have the potential to promote rat lung carcinogenesis, possibly via a mechanism involving stimulation of cell proliferation and DNA damage caused by oxygen radicals.",

        "abstract": "The incidence of urinary bladder cancer in the Ukraine increased from 26.2 to 43.3 per 100,000 population between 1986 and 2001 after the Chernobyl accident. The present study was conducted to evaluate the development of radiation-dependent lesions in the urinary bladders of people living in cesium 137 ((137)Cs) radio-contaminated areas of the Ukraine. Bladder urothelial biopsies from 159 male and 5 female patients were subjected to histological examination and immunohistochemical study of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), as well as the p50 and p65 subunits of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). A pattern of chronic proliferative atypical cystitis accompanied with large areas of sclerosis of connective tissue in the lamina propria was commonly observed in all cases. Interestingly, these lesions were associated with a dramatic increase in the incidences of dysplasia/carcinoma in situ, and, moreover, small urothelial carcinomas were incidentally detected. We defined the overall condition as \"Chernobyl cystitis.\" Greatly elevated levels of p38, p65 and p50 expression in the urothelium were evident and the patients showed increased (137)Cs in urine. The data support conclusions from our previous studies of a critical role for increased oxidative stress in generation of urinary bladder urothelial lesions in individuals chronically exposed to low-dose (137)Cs radiation. Alterations in the p38 MAPK cascade and accumulation of NF-kappa B subunits could be crucial early molecular events in the pathogenesis of Chernobyl cystitis.",

A total of 144 rats (10 weeks old at the start) were divided into four groups of 36 rats each. Groups 1-4 received DMA (purity 100%) at concentrations of 200, 50, 12.5 and 0 p.p.m. in the drinking water, respectively, for 104 weeks. From weeks 97 to 104, urinary bladder tumors were observed in 12 of 31, eight of 31 and none of 33 in groups 1-3, respectively. No bladder tumors were observed in group 4. The present study demonstrated that long-term p. o. administration of DMA induced urinary bladder carcinomas in male F344 rats. Therefore, the results indicate that DMA is carcinogenic for the rat urinary bladder, which may be related to the human carcinogenicity of arsenicals.",

In the present experiment, initiation (experiment 1) and promotion (experiment 2) effects of KA-induced hepatocarcinogenesis were studied by rat medium-term bioassay for carcinogenicity. Male F344 rats were administered a diet containing 0-2% KA. Experiment 1 demonstrated that KA had no effect on induction of liver preneoplastic lesions or glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) positive foci, in either number or area. In experiment 2, 2% KA treatment significantly increased the number and area of GST-P positive foci, but concentrations less than 0.5% did not. Moreover, 2% KA treatment significantly increased 8-OHdG levels and PCNA positive hepatocytes. The results indicated that low concentrations of KA do not have initiation effects on rat hepatocarcinogenesis, while higher concentrations of KA do promote hepatocarcinogenesis in rats. Thus, the results indicate that KA is a non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogen, showing the possible existence of a perfect threshold.",

        "abstract": "Humans may be exposed to 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f ]quinoxaline (MeIQx) at low doses during the period of gestation and lactation, and thereafter throughout life. The current study was designed to examine the possibility that early exposure may increase the risk of liver tumor development and related genetic changes. Male and female F344 rats were therefore administered MeIQx in diet (1, 10 and 100 ppm) for 4 weeks before mating and also during gestation and lactation. We also examined the carcinogenic risk of low-dose maternal and post-weaning exposure (MeIQx at doses of 1 and 10 ppm). Surviving male F1 rats were sacrificed under ether anesthesia at 19 weeks of age for analyses of glutathione S-transferase placental form-positive foci in the liver and aberrant crypt foci in the colon, as putative preneoplastic lesions. Transplacental and trans-breast milk exposure to MeIQx did not enhance development of the lesions, and levels of cell proliferation in the liver also did not differ from control values. However, excretion of MeIQx into breast milk and transfer to the fetus and offspring were observed with resultant hepatic MeIQx-DNA adducts and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine formation. Thus, our data suggest that maternal exposure to MeIQx during the period of pregnancy and lactation may not increase the risk of hepatocarcinogenesis in male offspring, despite causing genetic damage. If this result can be extrapolated to humans, exposure to MeIQx may not increase carcinogenic risk in offspring at usual human exposure levels.",

Here we show that a food-derived, genotoxic hepatocarcinogen, 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline, forms DNA adducts at low doses, but does not induce glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P)-positive foci (considered to be preneoplastic lesions) or 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine in rat liver. Moreover a N-nitroso compound, N-nitrosodiethylamine, at low doses was also found not to induce GST-P-positive foci in rat liver. These results imply that there is a no-observed effect level for hepatocarcinogenesis by these genotoxic carcinogens.",

        "abstract": "Arsenic is a well-documented human carcinogen, and contamination with this heavy metal is of global concern, presenting a major issue in environmental health. However, the mechanism by which arsenic induces cancer is unknown, in large part due to the lack of an appropriate animal model. In the present set of experiments, we focused on dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), a major metabolite of arsenic in most mammals including humans. We provide, for the first time, the full data, including detailed pathology, of the carcinogenicity of DMA in male F344 rats in a 2-year bioassay, along with the first assessment of the genetic alteration patterns in the induced rat urinary bladder tumors. Additionally, to test the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species (ROS) may play a role in DMA carcinogenesis, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) formation in urinary bladder was examined. In experiment 1, a total of 144 male F344 rats at 10 weeks of age were randomly divided into four groups that received DMA at concentrations of 0, 12.5, 50 and 200 p.p.m. in the drinking water, respectively, for 104 weeks. From weeks 97-104, urinary bladder tumors were observed in 8 of 31 and 12 of 31 rats in groups treated with 50 and 200 p.p.m. DMA, respectively, and the preneoplastic lesion, papillary or nodular hyperplasias (PN hyperplasia), was noted in 12 and 14 rats, respectively. DMA treatment did not cause tumors in other organs and no urinary bladder tumors or preneoplastic lesions were evident in the 0 and 12.5 p.p.m.-treated groups. Urinary levels of arsenicals increased significantly in a dose-responsive manner except for arsenobetaine (AsBe). DMA and trimethylarsine oxide (TMAO) were the major compounds detected in the urine, with small amounts of monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and tetramethylarsonium (TeMa) also detected. Significantly increased 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling indices were observed in the morphologically normal epithelium of the groups treated with 50 and 200 p.p.m. DMA. Mutation analysis showed that DMA-induced rat urinary bladder tumors had a low rate of H-ras mutations (2 of 20, 10%). No alterations of the p53, K-ras or beta-catenin genes were detected. Only one TCC (6%) demonstrated nuclear accumulation of p53 protein by immunohistochemistry. In 16 of 18 (89%) of the TTCs and 3 of 4 (75%) of the papillomas, decreased p27(kip1) expression could be demonstrated. Cyclin D1 overexpression was observed in 26 of 47 (55%) PN hyperplasias, 3 of 4 (75%) papillomas, and 10 of 18 (56%) TCCs. As a molecular marker of oxidative stress, increased COX-2 expression was noted in 17 of 18 (94%) TCCs, 4 of 4 (100%) papillomas, and 39 of 47 (83%) PN hyperplasias. In experiment 2, 8-OHdG formation in urinary bladder was significantly increased after treatment with 200 p.p.m. DMA in the drinking water for 2 weeks compared with the controls. The studies demonstrated DMA to be a carcinogen for the rat urinary bladder and suggested that DMA exposure may be relevant to the carcinogenic risk of inorganic arsenic in humans. Diverse genetic alterations observed in DMA-induced urinary bladder tumors imply that multiple genes are involved in stages of DMA-induced tumor development. Furthermore, generation of ROS is likely to play an important role in the early stages of DMA carcinogenesis.",

Male Big Blue rats were fed a diet containing 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, or 100 ppm of MeIQx for 16 weeks, and the frequencies of lacI mutants and glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) positive foci in the liver were determined. The mutation frequencies significantly increased at doses of 10 and 100 ppm, and GST-P positive foci significantly increased at a dose of 100 ppm. However, no statistical increases in both frequencies were observed at lower doses. MeIQx most frequently induced G frameshifts, followed by G to T transversions. Thus, no observed effect level (NOEL) was demonstrated for both carcinogenicity in terms of preneoplastic lesion induction and in vivo mutagenicity of MeIQx, and the NOEL for in vivo mutagenicity was lower than that for carcinogenicity.",

        "abstract": "1,4-Dioxane is primarily used as industrial solvent for paints, surface-treating agent for artificial leather and is a stabilizer for chlorinated solvent. However, little is known about the in vivo mutagenic effects of this rat liver carcinogen. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the dose-response relationship for in vivo mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of 1,4-dioxane in the livers of gpt delta transgenic rats, an animal model for in vivo mutagenicity analysis. Thirty, 6-week-old male gpt delta rats were divided into four groups and received 1,4-dioxane in drinking water at the concentrations of 0, 200, 1000, 5000 ppm up to 16 weeks, respectively. After the completion of treatment, all the rats were killed under ether anesthesia and livers were excised. Halves of the livers were fixed in 10% buffered formalin followed by paraffin embedding for histological analysis and the rests were frozen for molecular analysis. The number of glutathione S -transferase placental form (GST-P)-positive foci, a rat liver preneoplastic marker and PCNA-positive cell index, a marker for cell proliferation, were determined immunohistochemically, and mutation frequency followed by DNA sequencing was examined using frozen liver tissue. The number of GST-P-positive foci and PCNA-positive cell index were significantly ( p <0.0001, 0.01, respectively) increased only in the 5000 ppm group compared with control group. No difference was detected in all other groups. Mutation analysis revealed that treatment with 5000 ppm significantly ( p <0.001) increased the mutation frequencies of gpt transgene gene compared to control group, while doses up to 1000 ppm showed no effects. These results indicate the existence of threshold for liver carcinogenicity and in vivo mutagenicity of 1,4-dioxane.",

LMO7 was highly expressed in the mouse lung and predominantly localized to the apical membrane domain of bronchiolar epithelial cells. Although mice lacking LMO7 were viable and fertile in specific pathogen-free conditions, they developed protruding epithelial lesions in the terminal and respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts at 14-15 weeks of age. Furthermore, they tended to develop spontaneous adenocarcinoma in the lung at over 90 weeks of age. The cumulative incidence ratios of lung cancer were 22% in LMO7(-/-) mice and 13% in LMO7(+/-) mice whereas no primary lung cancer was observed in wild-type mice. Ex vivo analyses of the cancer cells showed numerical chromosome abnormalities and tumorigenicity in nude mice.

        "abstract": "We investigated promotion potential of ethanol after initiation of hepatocarcinogenesis in male, 21-day-old, F344 rats by exposure to 10 ppm 2-amino-3, 8-dimethylimidazo[4,5- f ]quinoxaline pellet diet for 8 weeks. The rats in group 1 were then fed on liquid control diet for 16 weeks, group 2 receiving the same diet containing 5% ethanol for 8 weeks followed by 8 weeks on the control diet, while group 3 animals were given 5% ethanol containing liquid diet for the entire16 weeks. On sacrifice at the end of week 24, glutathione S-transferase placental form positive foci, putative preneoplastic lesions in the liver, cell proliferation as indicated by proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunohistochemical staining and levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, a marker of oxidative DNA damage, were significantly increased in the liver of group 3 along with non significant alteration of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase mRNA expression. Lack of persistent increase of above parameters was found in transient ethanol exposure group. These results suggest that chronic consumption of ethanol promotes hepatocarcinogenesis by increasing oxidative stress and cell proliferation. It is also evident that abstinence of ethanol during the second stage stops its persistent promotion effect.",

        "title": "Understanding arsenic carcinogenicity by the use of animal models.",
        "abstract": "Although numerous epidemiological studies have indicated that human arsenic exposure is associated with increased incidences of bladder, liver, skin, and lung cancers, limited attempts have been made to understand mechanisms of carcinogenicity using animal models. Dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), an organic arsenic compound, is a major metabolite of ingested inorganic arsenics in mammals. Recent in vitro studies have proven DMA to be a potent clastogenic agent, capable of inducing DNA damage including double strand breaks and cross-link formation. In our attempts to clarify DMA carcinogenicity, we have recently shown carcinogenic effects of DMA and its related metabolites using various experimental protocols in rats and mice: (1) a multi-organ promotion bioassay in rats; (2) a two-stage promotion bioassay by DMA of rat urinary bladder and liver carcinogenesis; (3) a 2-year carcinogenicity test of DMA in rats; (4) studies on the effects of DMA on lung carcinogenesis in rats; (5) promotion of skin carcinogenesis by DMA in keratin (K6)/ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) transgenic mice; (6) carcinogenicity of DMA in p53(+/-) knockout and Mmh/8-OXOG-DNA glycolase (OGG1) mutant mice; (7) promoting effects of DMA and related organic arsenicals in rat liver; (8) promoting effects of DMA and related organic arsenicals in a rat multi-organ carcinogenesis test; and (9) 2-year carcinogenicity tests of monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and trimethylarsine oxide (TMAO) in rats. The results revealed that the adverse effects of arsenic occurred either by promoting and initiating carcinogenesis. These data, as covered in the present review, suggest that several mechanisms may be involved in arsenic carcinogenesis.",

        "abstract": "A novel serratane-type triterpenoid, 13alpha,14alpha-epoxy-3beta-methoxyserratan-21beta-ol (PJJ-34) derived from cuticles of Picea jezoensis Carr. var. jezoensis, has proved to be highly effective at suppressing carcinogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. To investigate possible anti-carcinogenic efficacy at the whole-body level, male Fischer 344 rats were subjected to an established rat multi-organ carcinogenesis bioassay (DMBDD model). After initiation with five carcinogens, groups 1-3 (20 in each) were intragastrically (i.g.) administered PJJ-34 dissolved in 1 ml of 0.5% CMC (5 times/week) at doses of 0, 5 and 10mg/kg body weight (b.w.), respectively, until the end of week 30. PJJ-34 did not show apparent toxicity. Incidences of adenomas (100-->75%) and carcinomas (63-->30%) in the lung were significantly decreased in the 5mg/kg b.w. group, and multiplicity of alveolar hyperplasias and total lung tumors (adenomas+carcinomas) were significantly reduced by both 5 and 10mg/kg. The incidence of colorectal tumors was also significantly decreased in the 10mg/kg group (63-->28%) along with the multiplicity. Rat liver pre-neoplastic lesions, glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) foci, and tumor development in the other organs were not affected. Immunohistochemical indices for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and cyclin D1 in normal alveolar epithelium of the lung were significantly suppressed at both doses. In conclusion, PJJ-34 is chemopreventive against lung and colon carcinogenesis without exerting apparent toxicity, and suppression of cell proliferation could play a key role in the underlying mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Sodium L-ascorbate (Na-AsA) is widely known to be a tumor promoter of rat bladder carcinogenesis but tests negative in standard 2-year bioassays. In the present study, bladder-cancer-susceptible transgenic rats designated Hras128 were used to further examine the tumorigenicity of Na-AsA. A total of 40 7-week-old male transgenic (Tg) and 42 littermate nontransgenic (Non-tg) rats were divided into 4 groups and given powdered MF diet with or without 5% Na-AsA for 57 weeks. Tg rats showed significantly short survival compared with Non-tg, independent of Na-AsA treatment. Tg rats treated with Na-AsA showed a slightly higher incidence of carcinoma (29.6%) as compared to those without Na-AsA treatment (15.4%), but this was without statistical significance. Moreover, the total bladder tumor incidences, including papillomas, did not differ statistically (with Na-AsA, 37.0%; without Na-AsA, 30.8%). No bladder tumor was detected in Non-tg rats. Various kinds of other lesions in various organs were noted in Tg rats treated with or without Na-AsA treatment, but no intergroup differences were evident. In conclusion, Na-AsA did not show tumorigenicity in highly bladder-cancer-susceptible transgenic Hras128 rats. These results suggest that Na-AsA is a pure promoter but not a complete carcinogen in rats.",

        "abstract": "Triterpenoid compounds, isolated from plants of Abies genus (Pinceae), are known to exert anti-tumor promotion activities in mouse skin carcinogenesis. In the present study, we investigated whether AVB-1 and acid and acid methyl ester derivatives have inhibitory effects on rat hepatocarcinogenesis by using a liver medium-term bioassay for carcinogens (Ito's test), immunohistochemically assessing the numbers and areas per cm(2) of preneoplastic lesions, glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P)-positive foci. In experiment 1, 6-week-old male Fisher 344 rats were given a single intraperitoneal injection of diethylnitrosamine (200 mg/kg b.w.) and subjected to two-thirds partial hepatectomy at week 3. From weeks 2 to 8, the compounds were given three times a week at a dose of 1 mg/kg b.w. by i.g. gavage and found to significantly decrease the number of GST-P-positive foci in the liver. In experiment 2, AVB-1 was given three times a week at doses of 3, 1, or 0.3 mg/kg b.w. by i.g. gavage from weeks 2 to 8. All doses of AVB-1 significantly decreased the numbers of GST-P-positive foci. Thus, our results suggest that AVB-1 is a chemopreventive agent for rat hepatocarcinogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Although ethanol is thought to be a tumor-promoter, there are conflicting results concerning its effects on experimental hepatocarcinogenesis. Furthermore, the relationship between the amount of ethanol consumed and tumor promoting effects has hitherto not been investigated in detail. In the present study, 21-day-old F344/DuCrj rats were fed 200 p.p.m. 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) in their diet for 8 weeks and thereafter received ethanol at doses of 0, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 20% in drinking water ad libitum for 16 weeks. The incidences of hepatocellular adenoma and total tumors increased dose-dependently with statistical significance at doses of 10% and 20%, compared to the initiated control value. Similarly, dose dependence was observed for the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, which was elevated significantly at the dose of 20%. No alteration in development of preneoplastic glutathione-S-transferase placental form positive foci or tumors was observed with 0.1-1%. Cell proliferation also increased dose-dependently and CYP2E1 protein induction was recognized in centrilobular regions without alteration in mRNA levels, but no effects were evident on formation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, an oxidative DNA damage marker, or lipid peroxidation in any of the initiated groups. The mRNA expression of cyclin D1 increased dose dependently. The results demonstrated that ethanol dose-dependently promotes hepatocarcinogenesis induced by MeIQx, but with no adverse influence at doses of 1% or less, comparable to sensible drinking levels in humans.",

        "abstract": "Oxidative stress to DNA is recognized as a mechanism underlying carcinogenic effects of some environmental agents. Here, we hypothesized that dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V)), an organic metabolite of inorganic arsenic in humans, might exert carcinogenic potential in a mouse line carrying a mutant Mmh allele of the Mmh/OGG1 gene encoding the enzyme 8-hydroxyguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1). Ogg1 mutant and wild type mice were treated with DMA(V) in their drinking water at a dose of 200 p.p.m. for up to 72 weeks. All DMA(V)-treated Ogg1(-/-)animals developed tumors, with a tendency for lower total incidences in the Ogg1(+/+) cases. Lung tumors in particular were induced as compared to the lack in non-carcinogen controls and were significantly more frequent in the homozygotes. At week 4, the levels of DNA 8-OH-dG and cell proliferation were significantly elevated in the lungs of non-treated Ogg1(-/-) as compared to Ogg1(+/+) mice and were strongly enhanced by DMA(V) treatment. Marked induction of Pola1, Cyp7b1, Ndfua3, Mmp13 and other genes specific to cell proliferation, cell signaling and xenobiotic metabolism in the lungs of DMA(V)-treated Ogg1(-/-) mice was found. Electron microscopic examination revealed the growth of microvilli, with increased numbers of mitochondria only in lungs and lung tumors of DMA(V)-exposed Ogg1(-/-) mice. Therefore, we strongly suggest that DMA(V) exerts carcinogenicity in the lungs of Ogg1(-/-) mutant mice, with a possible role for persistent accumulation of DNA oxidative adducts.",

Dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) has also been reported to act as a carcinogen/or a promoter in rat models. To elucidate molecular mechanisms, we conducted an 18 month carcino- genicity study of DMA in p53 heterozygous (/-) knockout mice, which are susceptible to early spontaneous develop- ment of various types of tumors, and wild-type (/) C57BL/6J mice. Totals of 88-90 males, 7-8 weeks of age, were divided into three groups each administered 0, 50 or 200 p.p.m. DMA in their drinking water for 18 months. Mice that were found moribund or died before the end of the study were autopsied to evaluate the tumor induction levels, as well as those killed at the end. Both p53/- knockout and wild-type mice demonstrated spontaneous tumor development, but lesions were more prevalent in the knockout case. Carcinogenic effect of DMA was evident by significant early induction of tumors in both treated p53/- knockout and wild-type mice, significant increase of the tumor multiplicity in 200 p.p.m.-treated p53/- knockout mice, and by significant increase in the incidence and multiplicity of tumors (malignant lymphomas) in the treated wild-type mice. By the end of 80 weeks, tumor induction, particularly malignant lymphomas and sar- comas, were similar in treated and control p53/- knockout",

The revised bioassay resulted in increasing preneoplastic or neoplastic lesions in the colon, urinary bladder and liver. S-Methylcysteine (SMC), a water-soluble organosulfur compound, was used as a test chemical in the new initiation regimen. Though SMC did not express clear-cut inhibitory effects in tumor levels, it showed modifying effects on the development of lung hyperplastic and colon preneoplastic lesions. In conclusion, the present model featuring high yields of preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions with low mortality in a short period (30 weeks), might be suitable for testing the efficacy of possible chemopreventive chemicals at the whole-body level.",

        "abstract": "Sodium l -ascorbate (Na-AsA) has been demonstrated to be a strong promoter of rat urinary bladder tumor development initiated by N -butyl- N -(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN). In the present study, we investigated variation in its promoting activity when the same total dose was given with different concentrations and exposure times. After 4 weeks administration of 0.05% BBN, group 1 served as a control without any post-initiation treatment. The rats in groups 2\u20134 received 1.25% Na-AsA diet for 36 weeks, 2.5% Na-AsA for 18 weeks and 5% Na-AsA for 8 weeks, respectively. Tumor number (papillomas and carcinomas) was greatest in group 3, and area in group 4 ( P <0.05). However, no enhancement was noted in group 2, although preneoplastic lesions were significantly increased. These results suggest that with the same total administration dose, high concentration of Na-AsA has the strongest promoting effects on tumor development in urinary bladder carcinogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Our recent research indicated that phenobarbital (PB) may inhibit the development of N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-initiated pre-neoplastic lesions at low doses in a rat liver medium-term bioassay (Ito test), while high doses exhibit promoting activity. This raises the question of whether treatment with low doses of PB might reduce cancer risk. For clarification, male 6-week-old F344 rats were treated with PB at doses of 0, 2, 15 and 500 p.p.m. in the diet for 10 or 33 weeks after initiation of hepatocarcinogenesis with DEN. In a second, short-term experiment, animals were given PB at doses of 2, 4, 15, 60 and 500 p.p.m. for 8 days. Formation of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) positive foci and liver tumors was inhibited at 2 p.p.m. Generation of oxidative DNA damage marker, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), cellular proliferation within the areas of GST-P positive foci and apoptosis in background liver parenchyma were suppressed. Suppression of 8-OHdG formation by PB at low dose might be related to the enhanced mRNA expression of 8-OHdG repair enzyme, oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (Ogg1). Moreover, as detected by cDNA microarray analysis, PB treatment at low dose enhanced mRNA expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), an enzyme involved in the synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and suppressed MAP kinase p38 and other intracellular kinases gene expression. On the contrary, when PB was applied at a high dose, GST-P positive foci numbers and areas, tumor multiplicity, hydroxyl radicals and 8-OHdG levels were greatly elevated with the increase in CYP2B1/2 and CYP3A2 mRNA, protein, activity and gene expression of GST, nuclear tyrosine phosphatase, NADPH- cytochrome P-450 reductase and guanine nucleotide binding protein G(O) alpha subunit. These results indicate that PB exhibits hormetic effect on rat hepatocarcinogenesis initiated with DEN by differentially altering cell proliferation, apoptosis and oxidative DNA damage at high and low doses.",

A total of 129 rats at 10 weeks of age were randomly divided into three groups and received drinking water containing MMA(V) at doses of 0 (Control), 50, and 200 ppm ad libitum for 104 weeks. No significant differences were found between the control and the MMA(V)-treated groups regarding clinical signs, mortality, hematological, and serum biochemistry findings. Quantitative analysis of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) positive foci in liver revealed a significant increase of numbers and areas in the 200 ppm MMA(V)-treated group. In the urinary bladder MMA(V) induced simple hyperplasia and significantly elevated the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive index in the urothelium. A variety of tumors developed in rats of all groups, including the controls, but all were histologically similar to those known to occur spontaneously in F344 rats and there were no significant differences among the groups. Thus, it could be concluded that, under the present experimental conditions, MMA(V) induced lesions in the liver and urinary bladder, but did not cause tumor development in male F344 rats even after 2 years exposure.",

In the present study, the role of MT in urinary bladder carcinogenesis induced by N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN) treatment was investigated using C57BL/6 mice. One hundred 5-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were divided into two groups, which were given drinking water with or without 0.05% BBN throughout the experimental period. Subgroups of ten animals from each group were sacrificed at weeks 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25, and urinary bladder samples were examined immunohistochemically for MT, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and apoptosis. MT was found to be abundant in normal-looking mucosa, but decreased with progression from precancerous lesions to invasive carcinoma in the urinary bladder obtained from BBN-treated mice. Lesions could be divided into MT-positive and negative. There was a tendency for greater MT expression in PCNA-positive lesions, while apoptosis was rather associated with MT-negativity. These data suggest that the overexpression of MT may play a role in mouse urinary bladder carcinogenesis.",

In Experiment 1, starting at six weeks of age, 65 rats were injected with DMH or saline alone once a week for four weeks. Rats in Groups 1 and 2 were fed diets containing 1% ginseng for five weeks, starting one week before the first dose of DMH. Animals in Groups 3 and 4 received ginseng for eight weeks after DMH treatment; Group 5 served as a carcinogen control group. In Experiment 2, 60 rats were injected with DMH or saline alone four times at one-week intervals. They were also fed diets containing 1% ginseng or the control diet throughout the 30 days of the experiment. In Experiment 1, numbers of foci with at least four crypts were significantly reduced in Group 2 treated with red ginseng during the initiation phase (p < 0.005). In Experiment 2, treatment with red ginseng also resulted in a decrease in the total number of DMH-induced ACF accompanied by a reduction in 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeling indexes in colonic crypts comprising ACF (p < 0.005 and p < 0.05, respectively). These findings suggest that dietary administration of red ginseng in combination with DMH suppresses colon carcinogenesis of rats, and the inhibition may be associated, in part, with suppression of cell proliferation in the colonic mucosa.",

        "abstract": "To search for a reliable biomarker of preneoplastic lesions arising early in mouse hepatocarcinogenesis the proteomes of microdissected basophilic foci, hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs), carcinomas (HCCs) and normal-appearing liver of B6C3F1 mice initiated with diethylnitrosamine (DEN) were analysed on anionic (Q10) surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) ProteinChip arrays. Significant overexpression of cytokeratin 8 (CK8; m/z 54, 565), cytokeratin 18 (CK18; m/z 47,538) proteins was found in basophilic foci as well as in HCAs and HCCs. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry demonstrated profound overexpression of CK8 and CK18 proteins (CK8/18) in all basophilic foci, mixed cell type foci, HCAs and HCCs in B6C3F1 and C57BL/6J mice initiated with DEN. A strong correlation between CK8/18-positive foci development and multiplicity of liver tumors in B6C3F1 and C57Bl/6J mice was further observed. Moreover, formation of CK8 and CK18 complexes due to CK8 phosphorylation at Ser73 and Ser431 was found to be strongly associated with neoplastic transformation of mice liver basophilic foci. Elevation of CK8/18 was strongly correlated with induction of cell proliferation in basophilic foci and tumors. In conclusion, our data imply that CK8/18 is a novel reliable marker of preneoplastic lesions arising during mouse hepatocarcinogenesis which might be used for prediction of tumor development and evaluation of environmental agents as well as drugs and food additives using mouse liver tests.",

        "abstract": "Monomethylarsonic acid (MMA(V)), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V)) and trimethylarsine oxide (TMAO(V)) are well-documented inorganic arsenic (iAs) methylated metabolites. In our previous studies, DMA(V) and TMAO(V) were shown to exert carcinogenicity in the rat bladder and liver, respectively. Furthermore, MMA(V), DMA(V) and TMAO(V) exhibited promoting activity on rat hepatocarcinogenesis. To clarify mechanisms of arsenical carcinogenicity and compare biological responses in the liver and bladder, male F344 rats were sequentially treated for 5, 10, 15, 20 days with MMA(V), DMA(V) and TMAO(V) in their drinking water at a dose of 0.02%. Significant increase of P450 total content and generation of hydroxyl radicals in the liver were observed from 10 and 15 days of treatment with arsenicals, respectively, with the highest levels induced by TMAO(V). Similarly, elevation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) formation was found in the DNA with significant increase by TMAO(V) treatment in the liver at days 15 and 20, and DMA(V) in the bladder after 20 days treatment. In addition, cell proliferation and apoptosis indices were significantly increased by TMAO(V) in the liver and by DMA(V) in the bladder of rats. These events were accompanied by differential up-regulation of phase I and II metabolizing enzymes, cyclins D1 and E, PCNA, caspase 3 and FasL. The results indicate that early elevation of 8-OHdG and cell proliferation via generation of oxidative stress by TMAO(V) and DMA(V) contributes to their carcinogenicity in the rat liver and bladder.",

The present experiment was designed to assess the potential chemopreventive properties of JTE-522, a new selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, on the induction of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF), a marker of rat colon carcinogenesis. A total of 80 male F344 rats were treated with 3 or 10 mg/kg of body weight JTE-522 or vehicle by oral gavage five times weekly from the start of the experiment. One week later, rats received s.c. injections of saline or 20 mg/kg of body weight DMH once weekly for four successive weeks. At the end of 12 weeks after the start of experiment, all rats were sacrificed and colons were evaluated for ACF. 10 mg/kg JTE522 significantly suppressed the total ACF/colon. No inhibitory effect was observed in the 3 mg/kg JTE-522 treatment group. This result suggests that JTE-522 possesses chemopreventive activity against colon carcinogenesis.",

        "abstract": "The mastic (Pistacia lentiscus var. chia) tree is native throughout the Mediterranean region and has long proved a source of food additives and medical treatments. To investigate the modifying effects of Chios Mastic Gum on rat liver carcinogenesis, 6-week-old male F344 rats were subjected to the established rat liver medium-term carcinogenesis bioassay (Ito-test). At the commencement, rats (groups 1-4) were intraperitoneally injected with 200 mg/kg body weight of diethylnitrosamine (DEN). After two weeks, mastic was added to CRF (Charles River Formula)-1 powdered basal diet at doses of 0, 0.01, 0.1 and 1% in groups 1-4, respectively. At week 3, all rats were underwent two-thirds partial hepatectomy. The experiment was terminated at week 8. As results show, liver weights were significantly increased in a mastic dose-dependent manner among groups 1-4. The numbers (/cm(2)) and the areas (mm(2)/cm(2)) of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P)-positive cell foci (>or=0.2 mm in diameter) were significantly increased in the DEN-1% group compared to the DEN-alone group, along with the average areas per foci and larger-sized foci (>or=0.4 mm). 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)+GST-P double-immunohistochemistry showed the highest BrdU-labeling indices within GST-P foci in the DEN-1% group. 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels in liver DNA did not vary, while real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of livers revealed many up- or down-regulated genes in the DEN-1% group. In conclusion, this is the first report to display a promotion potential of Chios Mastic Gum on the formation of preneoplastic lesions in the established rat liver medium-term carcinogenesis bioassay.",

Furthermore, formation of CK8 and CK18 complexes due to CK8 phosphorylation at Ser73 and Ser431 was found to be strongly associated with promotion of hepatocarcinogenesis by PB and the development of hepatocellular carcinomas. The data were confirmed by immunohistochemistry and real-time Q-PCR and profound overexpression of CK8 and CK18 (CK8/18) proteins and mRNAs were detected in several large size GST-P positive foci and liver tumors. A strong correlation between CK8/18 positive foci development and multiplicity of hepatocellular carcinomas was further observed. Moreover, elevation of CK8/18 was strongly associated with induction of cell proliferation in GST-P positive foci and tumors. In conclusion, our data imply that CK8/18 overexpression, those two cytokeratins complex formation associated with histone type 2 H2aa3 up-regulation and intermediate filament reorganization may drive neoplastic transformation of GST-P positive foci during rat hepatocarcinogenesis leading to the formation of hepatocellular carcinomas.",

The aim of this study was to examine the role of Th-2 cytokines during the development of Barrett's esophagus, using a rat model.Barrett's esophagus was induced by Levrat's esophagojejunostomy technique in Brown-Norway (BN) rats. Rats were killed at 8, 15, 30, and 50 weeks after the operation. We studied the incidences of esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus, and the mRNA expression of cytokines and CDX2 by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining. Finally, we compared the incidence of Barrett's esophagus in BN rats with that in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats.Esophagitis was found in all rats. Barrett's esophagus appeared 8 weeks after the operation, and its incidence and length increased over time. Levels of Th-2 cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, and IL-13 were significantly increased in Barrett's esophagus as compared to those in non-Barrett's esophagus, while there were no differences in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The peak of elevated IL-4 mRNA was observed before that of CDX2 mRNA. IL-4 was co-localized in CD4-positive cells and CDX2-positive goblet cells. The incidence of Barrett's esophagus was more common in BN rats (8/10, 80%) than in SD rats (2/7, 28%) at 30 weeks.Th-2 cytokines, especially IL-4, may play a crucial role in the development of Barrett's esophagus in an early phase. These results provide understanding of the pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus from the aspect of the Th-2 immune response.",

        "abstract": "Arsenic is a notorious environmental toxicant known to be carcinogenic for the skin, lung and urinary bladder in human beings. The carcinogenicity of trimethylarsine oxide (TMAO), one organic metabolite of inorganic arsenics in humans and experimental animals, was investigated here in male Fischer 344 rats in a 2-year carcinogenicity test. TMAO was administered to a total of 129 male rats ad libitum at concentrations of 0 (Control), 50 or 200 p.p.m. in the drinking water. In animals that died or were killed from the 87th week until the end of 104th week, incidences of hepatocellular adenomas were 14.3, 23.8 and 35.6% in the 0, 50 and 200 p.p.m.-treated groups, respectively; the multiplicities were 0.21, 0.33 and 0.53. Both were significantly increased in the 200 p.p.m.-treated group. While a variety of other tumors developed in various organs, they were present in all groups, including the controls, and were histologically diagnosed as those known to occur spontaneously in F344 rats. To test the contribution of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to TMAO tumorigenicity in the liver, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) formation was assessed by high performance liquid chromatography. The 8-OHdG values for the 200 p.p.m. TMAO group were significantly higher than those for the control group. Furthermore, as assessed by the proliferating cell nuclear antigen index, cell proliferation in the normally appearing parenchyma was elevated by the TMAO treatment. These results indicate that TMAO exerts liver tumorigenicity with possible mechanistic roles for oxidative DNA damage and enhanced cell proliferation.",

KBrO3 was dissolved in tap water and administered to groups 1-8 at concentrations of 0, 0.02, 0.2, 2, 8, 30, 125 and 500 ppm, respectively, for 16 weeks. Experiment 2 was performed to investigate the effects of KBrO3 at the 0.002 ppm dose approximately contained in the tap water on rat kidneys. Ten Big Blue rats were divided into 2 groups and given distilled water and tap water, respectively, for 16 weeks. In experiment 1, treatment with 500 ppm KBrO3 significantly increased the mutant and total mutation frequencies and frequency of GC to TA transversion of the lacI gene in the kidney compared to non-treatment control group, but 125 ppm and lower doses of KBrO3 had no effects. Histopathologically, renal toxic changes were observed in groups administered KBrO3 at 30 ppm or higher in a dose-dependent manner. PCNA positive cell indices in renal tubular cells were significantly increased in the kidney at doses of 125 and 500 ppm, but not at 30 ppm or lower doses, as compared to the control group. Furthermore, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine formation, a marker of oxidative stress, was significantly increased at 500 ppm. In experiment 2, there were no differences in any parameter between the distilled water and tap water groups. These results suggest the existence of no-effect levels for in vivo mutagenic and toxic effects, proliferation stimulus, and oxidative stress of KBrO3 in rat kidneys.",

In this experiment, inhibition of rat bladder carcinogenesis by intravesically instillated KRN7000 was investigated. Male Fischer 344 rats, 6-weeks-old at the start, were divided into 4 groups, all first receiving the carcinogen, 0.05% N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine, in their drinking water for 12 weeks. Then groups 1 and 2 respectively were administered 500 and 50 \u00b5 \u00b5 \u00b5 \u00b5 \u00b5g/kg of KRN7000 intravesically once weekly for 17 weeks. Group 3 similarly received only 0.3 ml of saline (vehicle control). Group 4 did not undergo bladder catheterization. On macroscopic examination at 30 weeks, multiplicities and sizes of bladder tumors in the KRN 7000 high and low-dose groups were not significantly different from those of the vehicle control group. Histologic examination confirmed no significant variation in incidences of carcinomas or preneoplastic lesions in the bladder among groups 1 to 4. Thus the results indicate that intravesical instillation of KRN7000 does not inhibit bladder carcinogenesis in rats.",

        "abstract": "We have previously demonstrated that JTE-522, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, inhibited development of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in rats, a putative preneoplastic lesion in colon, and suggested its inhibitory potential in rat colon carcinogenesis. To evaluate the chemopreventive properties of JTE-522, the present study was design to evaluate the inhibitory effects of JTE-522 on rat colon tumorigenesis induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH). Rats at 6 weeks of age were divided into 4 groups. One week after the start of the experiment, all rats received DMH by s.c. injection at a dose of 40 mg/kg body weight once a week for 4 successive weeks. As the initiation and postinitiation treatment groups, groups 1-3 were fed diets containing 0, 50, or 150 ppm JTE-522, respectively, from the start of the study to the end. As the postinitiation treatment group, group 4 was given 150 ppm JTE-522 from 1 week after the last DMH injection to the end of the study. Forty weeks after the start of the experiment, administration of 150 ppm JTE-522 during both initiation and postinitiation stages significantly inhibited the incidences of tubular adenocarcinomas and total carcinomas, as well as total tumors in the colon. The inhibitory effect of JTE-522 was most prominent for tubular adenocarcinomas, but was not observed in the nontubular carcinomas (signet-ring cell and mucinous carcinomas). Almost equal inhibitory effects on tubular adenocarcinomas were also observed in the rats given 150 ppm JTE-522 during the postinitiation stage, suggesting that its major anticancer action is at the postinitiation phase. However, JTE-522 had no effect on the size or invasive extent of tubular adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, microarray analyses revealed that JTE-522 had no effect on gene expression levels in DMH-induced tubular adenocarcinomas. These findings suggest that JTE-522 possesses chemopreventive activity against induction but not progression of tubular adenocarcinomas in rat colon. In view of the significant inhibitory effects of JTE-522 on ACF, its major anticancer action may occur in the postinitiation stage but before the malignant conversion stage of DMH-induced colon carcinogenesis.",

However, only limited information is available regarding dose-response curves for combination effects of multiple carcinogens at low dose. In the present study, 280 male F344 rats were divided into 14 groups to determine the effects of co-administration of various doses of 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 10% ethanol on the development of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P)-positive foci in the liver. The results provided concrete evidence for the existence of no effect levels for hepatocarcinogenicity of MeIQx either in presence or absence of ethanol and, therefore, for a practical threshold for this genotoxic carcinogen.",

        "abstract": "The dose dependence of the promoting effects of the \u03b1-isomer of benzene hexachloride (\u03b1-BHC) on hepatocarcinogenesis was investigated in a medium-term rat liver bioassay (Ito test). A total of 195 F344 male rats, 6 weeks old, were given a single intraperitoneal injection of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) at the start of the experiment and subjected to two-thirds partial hepatectomy at week 3. Two weeks after the administration of DEN, \u03b1-BHC were fed to rats at doses of 0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 7.5, 15, 30, 60, 125 and 500 ppm in diet for 6 weeks. All surviving animals were killed at week 8, and their livers were examined immunohistochemically for detection of glutathione S -transferase placental form (GST-P)-positive foci, surrogate preneoplastic lesions. Quantitative values for numbers and areas were dose-dependently increased in rats given \u03b1-BHC at 0.5\u2013500 ppm. However, those for groups treated with 0.01 and 0.1 ppm were decreased, albeit not significantly in comparison to the controls. Cytochrome P450 3A2 (CYP3A2) protein levels and activities showed a good correlation to the number and area of GST-P-positive foci. These results support evidence of hormesis and indicate a no-observed effect level for \u03b1-BHC promoting potentials may exist regarding rat liver carcinogenesis, which correlates with expression of CYP3A2 in the liver.",

        "title": "Testicular toxicity of DEHP, but not DEHA, is elevated under conditions of thioacetamide-induced liver damage",
        "abstract": "As part of an investigation of possible enhancement by liver disease of testicular toxicity caused by phthalates, we tested the effects of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) and di(2-ethylhexyl)adipate (DEHA) in a thioacetamide (TAA)-induced rat liver damage model. Male, 6-week-old, F344 rats ( n = 60) were divided into ten groups. Animals of groups 1\u20135 received TAA (200 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, three times per week) for 4 weeks, and groups 6\u201310 served as controls without TAA. After a 1 week interval, at week 5, powder diet containing DEHP or DEHA was provided to the animals of groups 1 and 6 (DEHP 25 000 ppm), groups 2 and 7 (DEHP 6000 ppm), groups 3 and 8 (DEHA 25 000 ppm) and groups 4 and 9 (DEHA 6000 ppm), while groups 5 and 10 received basal diet. All animals were sacrificed at week 9. Significant decrease in sperm numbers and motility and increase in morphology abnormalities were evident in group 1 as compared to groups 5 and 6 ( p < 0.01). However, DEHA treatment was not associated with any apparent testicular toxicity in either TAA- or vehicle-treated animals. Histopathological examination of the testes revealed severe atrophy and degeneration of testicular tubules in all animals given TAA and DEHP at high dose, only mild to moderate lesions being found with DEHP alone. We conclude that liver toxicity induced by TAA is associated with the enhancement of testicular toxicity of DEHP, but not DEHA, in rats. Keywords Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate Di(2-ethylhexyl)adipate Thioacetamide Testicular toxicity 1 Introduction Phthalates are plasticizers that impart flexibility and durability to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) products including building materials, food packaging, toys, blood bags, intravenous fluid bags and infusion sets and other medical devices [1] . They are ubiquitous environmental contaminants and are therefore found at some concentration in virtually all people [2\u20134] , high exposure being associated with toxicity, especially in reproductive systems [5\u20137] . While reproductive risk appears were minimal with general levels of intake, specific uses are potentially more problematic [8] , and recent U.S. FDA reports indicated that some individuals undergoing medical treatment may receive doses of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) which are far higher than does the population at large [9] . It is likely that levels of exposure to industrial chemicals that have no discernible effect on healthy personals can have profound impact with a background of illness, and exposure to phthalates may be more harmful in persons suffering from liver disease. With decreased hepatic detoxification or altered function, severe toxicity may result [10,11] and our previous report suggested that liver injury may enhance the rat testicular toxicity of di- n -butyl phthalate (DBP) [12] . The present investigation was conducted in order to determine whether this might also be the case with other phthalates. Among wildly used examples, we selected two representative phthalates, DEHP and di(2-ethylhexyl)adipate (DEHA) as test chemicals. DEHP is the principal phthalate used in a variety of products including medical devices, cabling, flooring and interiors, and DEHA can be found in many consumer items such as bath oils, eye shadow and cosmetic foundations. We here used thioacetamide (TAA), a hepatotoxin which causes liver cirrhosis on medium term treatment [13] , associated with oxidative stress [14] , and decreased catalase and glutathione peroxidase [15] . To investigate the possible enhancement of testicular toxicity in liver disease, we examined the effect of DEHP or DEHA in TAA-induced liver injury of rats. 2 Material and methods 2.1 Chemicals DEHP (>99.5%), DEHA (>99.5%), ethyl acetate and acetonitrile were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Adipic acid (AA), mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (MEHP) and TAA were from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) and bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and \u03b2-glucuronidase (from Escherichia coli ) were from Sigma\u2013Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). 2.2 Animals and treatment Sixty, 5-week-old, male F344 rats were obtained from Charles River Japan Inc. (Atsugi, Japan), and housed in rooms maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle, at constant temperature and humidity. They were allowed free access to MF powder diets (Oriental Yeast Co., Tokyo, Japan) during the experiment. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Osaka City University Medical School. The experimental design is illustrated in Fig. 1 . At 6 weeks of age, the rats were divided into ten groups (six rats per group). Animals of groups 1\u20135 were treated with TAA (200 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, three times per week) dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 4 weeks, and those of groups 6\u201310 received PBS alone without TAA. After a 1 week interval, at week 5, powder diet containing DEHP or DEHA was provided to the animals of groups 1 and 6 (DEHP 25 000 ppm), groups 2 and 7 (DEHP 6000 ppm), groups 3 and 8 (DEHA 25 000 ppm) and groups 4 and 9 (DEHA 6000 ppm), while groups 5 and 10 received basal diet. Body weights were measured every week and all animals were sacrificed at week 9 under ether anesthesia. At necropsy, blood samples were collected from the abdominal vein for measurement of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (\u03b3-GTP). The organs of interest (liver, testes, epididymes, prostates, seminal vesicles) were measured, resected and processed. 2.3 Analysis of spermatogenesis For the investigation of spermatogenesis, the testes and epididymes were removed. Sperm head counts were determined by methods as a previous report [16] with some modification. In briefly, the right testes were homogenized (Politoron-TP20, Politron, Switzerland) for 1 min in 10 mL water and counts of sperm heads were made in 1 mL chambers (Kova \u00ae Glasstic \u00ae Slide 10 with grids, Hycor Biomedical Inc., USA) under a microscope at 200\u00d7 magnification. Sperm collected from the caudal epididymes were incubated in Medium 199 (with Hank's salt, l -glutamine; Invitrogen) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Calbiochem) at 37 \u00b0C for 5 min. Subsequently more than 100 sperms were assessment for sperm motility and for sperm morphology abnormalities by manual counting under a microscope at 200\u00d7 and 400\u00d7 magnification, respectively. 2.4 Histopathological examination Liver, testes, epididymes, prostates and seminal vesicles were fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin, and routinely processed for embedding in paraffin, and staining of 4 \u03bcm sections with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathological examination. Samples of whole blood, a part of each liver and testes from all animals were also snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for measurement of concentrations of phthalates and their metabolites. 2.5 Measurement of DEHP and its metabolite, MEHP and MEHP-glucuronide Whole blood was diluted with Milli-Q water and liver and testis specimens were homogenized in Milli-Q water using a Polytron homogenizer. To an aliquot of diluted or homogenized sample, a four-fold volume of acetonitrile was added. For analysis of MEHP-glucuronide, \u03b2-glucuronidase was added to the diluted or homogenized samples in 0.1 M pyrophosphate buffer solution (pH 6.0) and the mixture was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 8 h prior to the addition of acetonitrile. After centrifugation at 3000 \u00d7 g for 20 min, the supernatant was then analyzed with a high-performance liquid chromatography system (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan), comprising with a pump PU-986, a UV/VIS detector UV-2070 and Borwin software for data collection and analysis under the following operating conditions: column, Develosil ODS-HG-5 (4.6 mm i.d. \u00d7 250 mm, Nomura Chemical Co. Ltd, Aichi, Japan); column temperature, 40 \u00b0C; flow rate, 1 mL/min; mobile phase, 92% or 70% acetonitrile containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid; detector wavelength, 225 nm. The recoveries of DEHP and MEHP were 96 \u00b1 1% and 102 \u00b1 1%, respectively. The detection limit for both DEHP and MEHP was 0.02 \u03bcg/mL. 2.6 Measurement of DEHA and its metabolite, AA and AA-glucuronide Blood and tissue samples were treated as described above. After acidification to pH 2\u20133 with 4 M HCl, aliquots of diluted or homogenized samples were extracted three times with ethyl acetate\u2013methanol (9:1) solution. For hydrolysis of conjugates, \u03b2-glucuronidase was added to the diluted or homogenized samples in 0.1 M pyrophosphate buffer solution (pH 6.0) and the mixture was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 8 h prior to extraction. The collected organic layer was dehydrated with anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated to dryness in vacuo, then the residue was dissolved in a small volume of ethyl acetate\u2013methanol (9:1) solution. After centrifugal elimination of insoluble compounds and evaporation of the solvent, the extract was trimethylsilylated with BSTFA, and DEHA and its metabolites were detected with a gas chromatograph system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an FID and Chromatopac C-R6A under the following operating conditions: column, silicone OV-17 5% uniport HP 80/100 (3.2 mm i.d. \u00d7 2 m, GL Science Inc., Tokyo Japan); column temperature, 70 \u00b0C (5 min isothermal), 70\u2013230 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0C/min), 230 \u00b0C (40 min isothermal); injector and detector temperatures, 260 \u00b0C; carrier gas, N 2 (60 mL/min). The recoveries of DEHA and AA were 87 \u00b1 2% and 98 \u00b1 6%, respectively. The detection limit for both DEHA and AA was 1 \u03bcg/mL. 2.7 Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using the JMP program (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). For all comparisons, probability values less than 5% ( p < 0.05) were considered to be statistically significant. The body weights, organ weights, sperm data, and metabolites data were analyzed by Bartlett's test (significance concluded at the 5% level) for homogeneity of variance for mean values of each group following the decision tree mentioned below. Homogenous data in Bartlett's test were subjected to the Tukey\u2013Kramer test. Heterogenous data in Bartlett's test were subjected to the Wilcoxon/Kruskal\u2013Wallis and subjected to Dunnett test. 3 Results 3.1 Change of body weights and relative organ weights Marked growth retardation was noted in the TAA treatment groups ( Fig. 2 ). From weeks 7 to 9 there was a significant decrease of body weight in group 1 compared to group 5 ( p < 0.05, p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively), and also in groups 6 and 8 compared to group 10 ( p < 0.01, respectively). Table 1 summarizes final body and relative organ weights. The final body weight in group 1 was significantly decreased compared to group 5 ( p < 0.01), and those of groups 6 and 8 were also significantly decreased compared to group 10. Those of TAA-treated groups (groups 1\u20135) were significantly decreased compared to vehicle-treated groups (groups 6\u201310) ( p < 0.01). Relative testes and epididymes weights of group 1 were significantly decreased compared to group 5 ( p < 0.01, p < 0.05, respectively), and there was also significantly decrease in group 1 compared to group 6 ( p < 0.05). Relative liver weights of groups 1\u20133 were significantly increased compared to group 5 ( p < 0.01), and those of groups 6\u20138 were also significantly increased compared to group 10 ( p < 0.01). There were no differences in relative prostate and seminal vesicles weights among the groups (data not shown). 3.2 ALT, AST and \u03b3-GTP serum values There was a significant increase of the ALT level in group 1 compared to group 5 ( p < 0.01). However, there were no differences in AST and \u03b3-GTP values among the groups (data not shown). 3.3 Analysis of spermatogenesis Data for sperm number, motility and morphology abnormality in rats treated with DEHP or DEHA are summarized in Table 2 . Sperm number and motility of group 1 were significantly decreased compared to group 5 or 6 ( p < 0.01), and morphology abnormality in group 1 was significantly increased compared to groups 5 and 6 ( p < 0.01). In group 6, sperm number and motility were lower, and morphology abnormality was higher as compared to group 10. 3.4 Histopathological examination of testes, epididymes and liver In group 1, severe atrophy of seminiferous tubules and loss of spermatogenic cells were evident in testes, and some tubules showed completely loss of spermatogenesis with empty lumina ( Fig. 3 A). In group 6, atrophy of seminiferous tubules and tubular degeneration in testes were also apparent but to a lesser extent than in group 1 ( Fig. 3 B). The animals treated with DEHA did not exhibit evident testicular toxicity. Hypertrophy of hepatocytes was evident in livers from animals of groups 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8. 3.5 Concentrations of DEHP, DEHA and their metabolites Data for concentrations of DEHP and its metabolites are shown in Fig. 4 . The MEHP concentration in livers of group 1 was significant lowered compared to group 6 ( p < 0.05), while the MEHP-glucuronide concentration was significantly increased ( p < 0.05). There was no such variation in DEHP, MEHP and MEHP-glucuronide concentrations in blood and testis. Data for concentrations of DEHA and its metabolites are shown in Fig. 5 . In the DEHA treatment groups, the AA concentration in blood of group 3 was significantly lowered compared to group 8 ( p < 0.05). However, the AA-glucuronide concentration in blood of group 3 was not different from that in group 8. There were no differences DEHA, AA and AA-glucuronide concentrations in liver and testis. The concentration of DEHA was under the detection of level in all groups. 4 Discussion In the present study, high dose treatment with DEHP caused testicular toxicity in rats, and this was enhanced under conditions of liver damage induced by TAA. In contrast, DEHA did not show major testicular toxicity in any group. Apparent testicular lesions such as seminiferous tubule atrophy and degeneration caused by DEHP treatment are in line with previous reports [17,18] . However, 6000 ppm treatment was not associated with evident toxicity in either TAA- or vehicle-treated animals. In rodents, DEHP or MEHP, a major DEHP metabolite, are established as testicular toxicants [19\u201321] , the observed changes being related to anti-proliferative effects on Sertoli cells [22,23] , and interference with testosterone synthesis in the developing organism [24,25] . In general, phthalate esters are rapidly converted to their corresponding monoesters and then to ultimate metabolites that are excreted in urine [26] . DEHP is absorbed from the gut of rodents, mostly in the form of the monoester, then metabolized to several proximate active compounds, and excreted in the urine and feces [27\u201329] . In this study, even though the liver MEHP concentration in group 1 was significant decreased as compared to group 6, there were no differences in DEHP, MEHP or MEHP-glucuronide concentrations in blood and testis. Therefore, it seems the observed enhancement of testicular toxicity is not associated with alteration of DEHP and its metabolites in rats with liver damage. Furthermore, since hypertrophy of liver was evident with both low and high dose DEHP treatment as well as with high dose DEHA treatment, irrespective of TAA treatment, this also do not correlate with testicular toxicity. As experimental cirrhosis is associated with decrease of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase in the testis [30] as well as liver [15] , an imbalance of the antioxidant system could play a role, even after withdrawal of TAA. In this condition, DEHP treatment may cause increased oxidative stress. This hypothesis now needs to be tested and the mechanisms of enhanced phthalate toxicity with liver damage further investigated in detail, taking into consideration variation in susceptibility with the age [24,31] , and species [8] . The growth retardation found with high dose DEHA treatment is in accordance with previous reports [32,33] .

        "abstract": "2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), the most abundant food-derived mutagenic/carcinogenic heterocyclic amine (HCA), has attracted particular attention as a probable human colon carcinogen. Some studies have shown that PhIP administered in the post-initiation phase is able to enhance rat colon carcinogenesis remarkably. To determine whether this genotoxicant leaves a DNA footprint in colon carcinogenesis, 6-week-old male F344 rats were first subcutaneously injected with azoxymethane (AOM) and then continuously treated with various doses (0-200 ppm) of PhIP added to their diet. Animals were killed at week 36 for histopathological examination, and colonic adenocarcinomas derived from animals receiving 0, 50 and 200 ppm PhIP were subjected to a novel three-dimensional (3D)-microarray and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. A total of five candidate genes were identified in adenocarcinomas following 200 ppm of PhIP and AOM initiation, with a dose-dependent increment. Among them, Stat1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) and VEGFc (vascular endothelial growth factor c) demonstrated statistically significant upregulation by real-time RT-PCR. In addition, HSP90 (heat shock protein 90) and VEGFa showed a non-significant tendency to increase. In summary, overexpression of Stat1, VEGF and other genes could be involved in PhIP-enhanced colon tumorigenesis in the post-initiation phase.",

        "abstract": "Recently the idea of hormesis, a biphasic dose-response relationship in which a chemical exerts opposite effects dependent on the dose, has attracted interest in the field of carcinogenesis. With non-genotoxic agents there is considerable experimental evidence in support of hormesis and the present review highlights current knowledge of dose- response effects. In particular, several in vivo studies have provided support for the idea that non-genotoxic carcinogens may inhibit hepatocarcinogenesis at low doses. Here, we survey the examples and discuss possible mechanisms of hormesis with cytochrome P450 inducers, such as phenobarbital, 1,1-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichloroethane (DDT), \u03b1-benzene hexachloride (\u03b1-BHC), and other non-genotoxins. Epigenetic processes differentially can be affected by agents that impinge on oxidative stress, DNA repair, cell proliferation, apoptosis, intracellular communication and cell signaling. Non-genotoxic carcinogens may target nuclear receptors, cause aberrant DNA methylation at the genomic level and induce post-translational modifications at the protein level, thereby impacting on the stability or activity of key regulatory proteins, including oncoproteins and tumor suppressor proteins. Via multiple epigenetic lesions, non- genotoxic carcinogens can elicit a variety of changes contributing to cellular carcinogenesis. (J Toxicol Pathol 2006; 19: 111-122)",

F344 rats were administered ETBE at doses of 0, and 1,000 mg/kg body weight twice a day by gavage for 3, 10, 17 and 28 days. It was found that the previously observed significant increase of P450 total content and hydroxyl radical levels after 7 days of ETBE administration, and 8-OHdG formation at day 14, accompanied by accumulation of CYP2B1/2B2, CYP3A1/3A2, CYP2C6, CYP2E1 and CYP1A1 and downregulation of DNA oxoguanine glycosylase 1, was preceded by induction of cell proliferation at day 3. Furthermore, we observed an increase in regenerative cell proliferation as a result of ETBE treatment at day 28, followed by induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by day 14. These results indicated that short-term administration of ETBE led to a significant early increase in cell proliferation activity associated with induction of oxidative stress, and to a regenerative cell proliferation as an adaptive response, which could contribute to the hepatotumorigenicity of ETBE in rats.

        "abstract": "This paper studied the effects of different NO3- concentration on the photosynthetic rate, photochemical efficiency, and absorbed light energy allocation in cucumber seedling leaves. The results indicated that when the available NO3- concentration in the medium was low (14-98 mmol NO3- x L(-1)), an appropriate supplement of NO3- could enhance the capability of cucumber leaves in capturing light energy, and promote the photosynthesis. However, with further increase of NO3-, the photochemical efficiency of PS II decreased, electron transfer restrained, and net photosynthetic rate as well as the absorbed light energy used in photochemical reaction of PS II decreased. At the same time, the light energy used in antenna heat dissipation increased, while the photochemical efficiency decreased. After treated with 140 and 182 mmol NO3- x L(-1) for 6 days, the photosynthetic rate (P(n)) was decreased by 35% and 78%, respectively, maximal PS II efficiency at open centers in the absence of NPQ (F(v)/F(m)), antenna efficiency at open centers in the presence of NPQ (F(v)'/F(m)'), actual PS II efficiency (phi (PSII ) and photochemical quenching (q(P)) were lower, non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) was higher, and the deviation from full balance between PS I and PS II (beta/alpha - 1) was improved significantly, compared with the control. The fluctuant ranges of these chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were increased at higher NO3- concentration, compared with those at lower NO3- concentration. The absorbed light energy allocated to the photochemical reaction of PS II (P) was reduced by high light intensity and high NO3- concentration. Meanwhile, the proportion allocated in antenna heat dissipation (D) increased significantly. Antenna heat dissipation was the main way for excessive energy dissipation.",

Five treatments were designed by mixing vermicompost and soil at ratio of 0:7, 1:7, 2:7, 4:7, 7:0 (w/w). Marketable weight of Chinese cabbage was significantly (p < 0. 05) higher in the 2:1 treatment than in the other treatments, while plants grown in the full soil treatment (0:7) showed the lowest marketable weight (Fig. 1a). Vermicompost application significantly increased the nutrient content of Chinese cabbage leaves (p < 0. 05), especially in the 4:7 treatment, with increases in the contents of soluble sugar (Fig. 2a), soluble protein (Fig. 2b), vitamin C (Fig. 3a), total phenols (Fig. 3b), and total flavonoids (Fig. 3c) by 62%, 18%, 200%, 25%, and 17% compared to the full soil treatment, respectively.

Comparing with continuous cropping, the increasing amplitude of soil pH and the decrease amplitude of soil EC of rhizosphere soil of rotated cucumbers were bigger, the content of available P in the rhizosphere soil was higher in the early growth stage and became lower later, the content of available N and available K were higher all the time. The activities of urease, phosphatase and catalase were higher. There were more bacteria and actinomycetes in the soil but the amount of fungi was smaller. Rotation with Welsh onion could repair the the rhizosphere micro ecological environment of cucumber and it can be used as a high efficiency farming mode in preventing cucumber continuous cropping obstacles.",

Under the stress of 100 mmol NaCl x L(-1), the leaf electrolyte leakage rate and malondialdehyde (MDA) content of the grafted seedlings were significantly lower than those of self-rooted seedlings, and the seedlings grafted on 'Figleaf gourd' showed the lowest electrolyte leakage rate and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, followed by the seedlings grafted on 'Tielizhen', 'Shintosa' , and 'Sherpa'. The leaf proline and soluble sugar contents and peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities of the grafted seedlings were significantly higher than those of the self-rooted seedlings, and the POD, SOD, CAT, and APX activities were the highest for the seedlings grafted on 'Figleaf gourd' and the lowest for the seedlings grafted on 'Sherpa', but had no significant differences for the seedlings grafted on 'Tielizhen' and 'Shintosa'. The leaf Na+ content of the seedlings grafted on different rootstock varieties ranked as 'Figleaf gourd' < 'Tielizhen' < 'Shintosa' < 'Sherpa', while the leaf K+ content had little difference for the seedlings grafted on 'Figleaf gourd', 'Tielizhen', and 'Shintosa' but was significantly higher than that for the seedlings grafted on 'Sherpa'. The self-rooted seedlings had the highest leaf Na+ content but the lowest leaf K+ content. The leaf Na+/K+ ratio of grafted seedlings was significantly lower than that of self-rooted ones, and the seedlings grafted on 'Figleaf gourd' had the lowest leaf Na+/K+ ratio.",

        "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) is one heavy metal which is toxic and can cause physiological disorder of plants. In the present experiment, effects of Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), A NO donor, on the phenotype, photosynthesis and oxidative stress of cucumber leaves were studied under Cd stress. Application of 100\u03bcM CdCl2 induced obvious chlorosis of cucumber leaves with lower pigment content and lower net photosynthetic rate (PN). Higher accumulations of H2O2 and thiobarbituric acidreactive substances (TBARS) were observed in Cd-treated cucumber leaves, which indicated Cd induced oxidative stress to cucumber leaves. Application of 100\u03bcM SNP reversed the chlorosis and lower PN induced by Cd treatment. Activities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes and antioxidant capacity expressed by \u03b1,\u03b1-diphenyl-\u03b2-picryllhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity, chelating activity of ferrous ions and hydroxyl radical (OH\u00b7) scavenging activity were significantly increased by SNP under Cd stress. On the contrary, the above effects of SNP were not observed after the application of potassium ferrocyanide which is an analog of SNP that does not release NO. Therefore, it could be concluded that the NO from SNP might account for the alleviating effect of Cd stress on cucumber plants.",

In winter, the temperature and heat flux of the wall inner surface and outer surface varied over a wide range, which was in accordance with the variation trend of indoor and outdoor air temperature. Overall, the wall temperature decreased from the inner to the outer surface, and the layers of the inner wall with higher variation range of temperature and heat flux were more than those of the outer wall. The variation range of temperature and heat flux decreased gradually from the shallow layers to deep layers of the wall. In successive cloudy days, the temperature of each layer of inner wall decreased to different degrees, and the layers releasing heat to the indoor deepened constantly, whereas the heat in the layers of outer wall was mainly released to the outdoor. According to the variation patterns of temperature and heat flux in the wall, the wall from inside to outside could be divided into heat storage layer, transitional layer, and cold resistant layer, and their thickness was 0.8-1.0 m, 2.2-2.6 m, and 0.4-0.6 m, respectively, under the condition of the outer surface being covered. Without considering the transitional layer, the suitable thickness of the soil wall in Shouguang solar greenhouse would be 1.4-1.6 m.",

        "abstract": "The ultrastructural localization of calcium in cucumber seedling leaves was determined with the improved cytochemical method of calcium pyroantimonate precipitation, and the changes of calcium level in cells under NO 3 - stress were observed. After 7 d of treatment under optimum NO3 - conditions, calcium antimonite deposits, which indicate calcium distribution, were mainly localized in intercellular spaces, cell wall and chloroplast, and smaller amounts of calcium precipitates randomly resided in plasma membrane and mitochondria. But under excessive NO3 - stress, the distribution of Ca2+ in subcellular was changed greatly. Under 56, 98, 140 mmol\u00b7L-1 of NO3 - concentrations, Ca2+ level in cytoplasm and nucleus increased with the increases in NO3 - concentration, due possibly to the opening of the channels in plasma membrane and tonoplast as well as the decrease or activity loss of the calcium pump. The increase of Ca2+ in the protoplasm might cause a series of disorders in metabolic processes. With the increasing NO3 - concentrations, larger Ca2+ deposits localized on the envelope of plastid and Ca2+ were also deposited together in the intercellular spaces, while Ca2+ deposits were small and dense on the plasma membrane. In addition, Ca2+ accumulation in the mitochondria remained low and the shape and amount were also changed. Under 182 mmol\u00b7L -1 NO3 -, Ca2+ deposits in each compartment became smaller and denser, shacked tonoplast was not found, and Ca in vacuoles was distributed closely to tonoplast. The possible relationship between the responsiveness of Ca2+ distribution in leaf cells and cucumber NO3 - tolerance was discussed.",

A full-length cDNA clone encoding\n nitrate reductase (NR; EC 1.6.6.1) was isolated from cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) by RT-PCR and RACE techniques. The NR of cucumber (CsNR), a full-length cDNA sequence of 3032\u00a0bp contains an open reading frame of 2748\u00a0bp encoding 915 amino acids. The deduced\n 915 amino acid sequence showed high identities with NR from other plants. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that\n CsNR expression was different in root, stem, leaf, flower and mature fruit tissues. CsNR transcript level and nitrate reductase activity (NRA) was down-regulated and the change in NO3\n \u2212 concentration showed a negative trend with NRA in leaves when subjected to the 182\u00a0mM NO3\n \u2212 treatment. However, the CsNR transcript level was up-regulated in roots by 182\u00a0mM NO3\n \u2212 treatment. Furthermore, NRA in roots lagged behind CsNR expression and there was no obvious lag of NRA in leaves. This study found that in roots, there was no obvious relationship\n between NRA and NO3\n \u2212 content.

Comparing with continuous cropping, rotation improved the components of soil microbial communities, which was manifested in the increase of bacteria and actinomycetes and the decrease of fungi. Rotation and fallowing enhanced the activities of soil invertase, urease, catalase, and polyphenol oxidase significantly. The quantities of soil bacteria and actinomycetes and the activity of soil invertase increased at the fruiting stage of cucumber plants, being the maximum at harvest stage, but decreased thereafter. In contrast, the quantity of soil fungi had a linear increase, and the activities of soil urease, catalase, and polyphenol oxidase decreased gradually during fruit development. Welsh onion and waxy maize promoted the growth and fruiting of the followed cucumber plants significantly, being the optimal rotation crops for cucumber.",

On the 7th day under nitrate stress, the shoot fresh mass per plant decreased by 12. 77 g, leaf SOD, POD and CAT activities increased, while leaf APX, DHAR and GR activities decreased significantly, compared with the control. The addition of low concentration (0.05 mmol \u00b7 L-1) LaCl3 increased the shoot fresh mass per plant by 35%, enhanced the leaf thermally stable protein content and SOD, POD, CAT, APX, DHAR and GR activities, and decreased the leaf MDA content and electrolytic leakage, resulting in a definite alleviation of the inhibitory effects of nitrate. However, an addition of high concentration. (0. 5 mmol \u00b7 L LaCl3 had no obvious alleviation effect. It was concluded that the addition of certain concentration LaCl3 could alleviate the nitrate stress on cucumber via increasing anti-oxidative enzymes activities and thermally stable protein content.",

Under the stress of 140 mmol \u00b7 L-1 NO3 -, treating with 0.1 mmol \u00b7 L-1 of SNP for 1 d or 7 d increased the leaf soluble protein content and superoxidase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbic acid peroxidase (APX) activities, and decreased the leaf malondialdehyde ( MDA ) content significantly, suggesting that exogenous NO could enhance the capacity of cucumber seedlings in scavenging active oxygen species, protect the seedlings from the peroxidation of membrane lipids, and promote the seedlings growth and increase their resistance to high concentration NO3 - stress. After the cucumber seedlings grew in 0.3 mmol \u00b7 L-1 of SNP for 7 d, the activities of leaf SOD, POD, and CAT decreased, and the MDA content increased, resulting in the injury of cucumber seedlings.

Light-emitting diodes were used as the light source and there were five light combinations: white light (420-680\u202fnm); blue light (460\u202fnm); red light (635\u202fnm); RB31 (ratio of red and blue light, 3: 1); and RB71 (ratio of red and blue light, 7: 1). Compared with other treatments, blue light significantly decreased the incidence of powdery mildew in leaves of melon seedlings. Under blue light, HO showed higher accumulation, and the content of phenolics, flavonoid and tannins, as well as expression of the genes involved in synthesis of these substances, significantly increased compared with other treatments before and after infection. Lignin content and expression of the genes related to its synthesis were also induced by blue light before infection. Melon irradiated with RB31 light showed the best growth parameters. Compared with white light, red light and RB71, RB31 showed higher accumulation of lignin and lower incidence of powdery mildew. We conclude that blue light increases melon resistance to powdery mildew, which is dependent on the induction of secondary metabolism that may be related to HO accumulation before infection. Induction of tolerance of melon seeds to powdery mildew by RB31 is due to higher levels of sucrose metabolism and accumulation of lignin.",

        "abstract": "Overwinter cucumber with summer fallow (SF) rotation is the predominant cropping system in plastic greenhouses in China; however, problems with continuous cropping systems have become increasingly serious as the greenhouse ages, for example, acidification, secondary salinisation and an imbalance of nutrients and microbial communities. In this study, we evaluated the effects of short-term rotations on enzyme activities, physico- chemical properties and microbial populations in soils (0-20 cm) of plastic greenhouses in ShouGuang City, China. Soil samples were collected from different stages of treatments. Specifically, soil was sampled before fallow and rotation (BFR), after fallow and rotation (AFR) and at following cucumber harvest period (AHP). Compared with SF and RC (rice-cucumber), a rotation composed of cucumber and scallion (SC) was effective in preventing continuous-cropping soil acidification and cucumber rotations with maize (MC) alleviated soil secondary salinisation. AFR and AHP, invertase, urease and catalase activities were higher in MC, SC and RC treatments than in SF. In addition, cucumber rotated with scallion, maize improved the soil microbial flora. Compared to fallow and rice rotations, the number of bacteria and actinomycetes increased under scallion and maize rotations, while the number of fungi decreased. So our results show that continuous cropping cucumber rotation with scallion or maize in summer fallow period, not rice, has positive effects on soil quality parameters such as physicochemical and biological properties.",

The results indicated that compared with white light, red light could significantly promote the growth of G. bicolor and induce the accumulation of dry substance and soluble sugar content, but blue light inhibited the plant growth. The content of chlorophyll significantly decreased under the colored LEDs. Although the combination of red, blue and yellow light did not increase the dry substance accumulation, it resulted in significant elevation of total phenols, flavonoids and anthocyanins. The accumulation of these reduced substances could increase the tolerance to oxidative stress and the nutrient value in G. bicolor.

There were five different treatments which were spraying water, ABA, CaCl+ABA, LaCl(calcium channel inhibitor)+ABA and EGTA (calcium ion chelating agent)+ABA under drought stress. The results showed that drought stress inhibited the growth of cucumber seedlings, and reduced the activities of antioxidant enzymes, nitrate reductase, net photosynthetic rate and fluorescence parameters of the cucumber seedlings leaves. The application of ABA reduced the inhibition of activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), photosynthesis (P, g) and the fluorescence parameters (F'/F', q and ETR), and decreased the damage of drought stress on plant. Spraying CaCl+ABAsignificantly promoted the positive effect of ABA, while EGTA+ABA and LaCl +ABA didn't show the promoting effect.",

        "abstract": "'Jinyan No. 4'cucumber was used as experimental material. The growth of cucumber radicles treated with different concentrations of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5 and 20 mmol\u00b7L) was investigated firstly, and 10 mmol\u00b7L p-hydroxybenzoic acid was chosen for the further experiment. To investigate if melatonin alleviate p-hydroxybenzoic acid stress on cucumber radical elongation, 0, 1, 10, 25, 50, 75 and 100 \u03bcmol\u00b7L melatonin were used to pretreat cucumber seeds for 24 h before 10 mmol\u00b7L p-hydroxybenzoic acid treatment. The results suggested that exogenous melatonin could alleviate the radicle growth inhibition induced by p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and 75 \u03bcmol\u00b7L melatonin showed the best effect. The growth of cucumber radical was significantly inhibited with an increase in p-hydroxybenzoic acid concentration, which was accompanied with lower activity of amylase. The melatonin pretreatment could significantly increase the activities of amylase and antioxidant enzymes in cucumber seeds resulting in lower accumulation of O, HO and MDA. Exogenous melatonin effectively reduced the PHBA stress on cucumber germination, which might be due to its function in decreasing oxidative stress and promoting starch catabolism.",

The results showed that, under low N condition, PHA could significantly increase the total root length, root surface area, root tip number and root volume of cucumber seedlings, and promote plant height, stem diameter and leaf area. Proline and soluble sugar contents in cucumber leaves were significantly increased by PHA. The absorption of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe in cucumber seedlings was promoted. According to the response of the two cucumber cultivars to PHA under low N stress, some traits of two cultivars showed different sensitivity to PHA level. The comprehensive analysis of the above results inferred that the PHA level from 100 mg\u00b7L to 150 mg\u00b7L could significantly enhance the growth and nutrient absorption of cucumber seedlings.",

The results indicated that the growth was significantly inhibited under suboptimal temperature compared with appropriate temperature treatment; the plant heights, leaf areas and dry matter accumulations were markedly decreased. The effects of iron deficiency under suboptimal temperature on the growth of tomato seedlings were larger than that of under appropriate temperature treatments. Under suboptimal temperature, the plant heights of tomato seedlings in iron deficiency and/or NO stress treatments were not significantly different from no stress treatment, but leaf areas and leaf chlorophyll content of tomato seedlings were decreased obviously. The leaf electrolytic leakage, root activity and Fe reductase activity of tomato seedlings were markedly increased under suboptimal temperature, but chlorophyll content, total root length, root surface area, root tip number and root volume were obviously reduced. The iron contents in roots, stems and leaves of tomato seedlings were also remarkably decreased. The NO stress and the combined stress of iron deficiency and NO stress under suboptimal temperature aggravated the reduction of dry matter, leaf electrolytic leakage and the inhibition of iron ion absorption in tomato seedlings. The iron ion absorption showed the antagonistic impact on the absorption of potassium and calcium ion, but showed different effects among different organs. The iron deficiency symptom of tomato seedlings was aggravated by reducing the concentration of iron ion in the nutrient solution.",

The results indicated that after 7 d of treatment, iron deficiency inhibited the tomato seedling growth, decreased chlorophyll (a and b) and carotenoid contents, and led to obvious chlorosis; iron deficiency also reduced the activity of SOD, POD and CAT, resulting in significant accumulation of MDA contents and higher electrolytic leakage; proline and soluble sugar contents were not significantly changed; contents of N, P, K, Ca, Mg and Fe in both leaves and roots of tomato seedlings were decreased under iron deficiency in varying degrees. The combined stress of NO stress and iron deficiency promoted the inhibition of plant growth, decreased chlorophyll (a and b), carotenoid contents and the activities of SOD, POD and CAT; electrolytic leakage MDA, proline and soluble sugar contents of N, P, Mg, Fe in both leaves and roots of tomato seedlings were much lower, but the contents of K and Ca were significantly increased. Compared to the treatment without SNP, adding 0.1 mmol\u00b7L SNP could alleviate the growth inhibition of stressed tomato seedlings. Adding 0.1 mmol\u00b7L SF (sodium ferrocyanide) also showed alleviating or promoting effect on some above indexes including the activity of SOD, POD and CAT to some degree, but the other physiological indexes were not significantly changed because iron was contained in SF.",

The results showed that yield and quality of eggplants were significantly influenced by N, PO and KO concentrations. The yield was most influenced by KO concentration, and followed by N and then PO. The quality was also most influenced by KO concentration, and followed by PO and then N. There were significant interactive effects of N+PO, N+KO and PO+KO on yield, and significant interaction of N+KO on eggplant quality. Under lower concentrations, the yield and quality of eggplants enhanced with the increasing N, PO and KO concentrations. When the nutrient concentrations exceeded a threshold, both yield and quality decreased. According to computer simulations, the yield could reach to 3600 g\u00b7plant when the fertilization schemes were N 16.0-20.0 mmol\u00b7L, PO 2.2-2.6 mmol\u00b7L and KO 9.9-12.9 mmol\u00b7L; the fertilization scheme needed to obtain a comprehensive quality score of higher than 90 were N 18.0-21.1 mmol\u00b7L, PO 1.9-2.6 mmol\u00b7L and KO 10.6-13.3 mmol\u00b7L. In summary, fertilization scheme of high yield (43.2 kg\u00b7plot) and high quality(comprehensive score of higher than 90) of eggplants were N 18.0-20.0 mmol\u00b7L, PO 2.2-2.6 mmol\u00b7L, KO 10.6-12.9 mmol\u00b7L, with an appropriate N, PO and KO proportion of 1:0.13:0.62.",

The results showed that NaHCO stress significantly induced production of O and accumulation of HO in leaves and roots, resulting in the increases of MDA content and electrolyte leakage. Under NaHCO stress, activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, dehydroascorbatereductase, monodehydrodroascorbate reductase, and glutathione reductase as well as contents of ascorbic acid and glutathione were firstly increased and then decreased with progress of stress time. Exogenous EBR application significantly increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes and contents of antioxidants as well as the ratio of AsA/DHA (dehydroascorbic acid) and GSH/GSSG (L-glutathione oxidized) in leaves and roots of cucumber under NaHCO stress. Such changes improved the redox hemostasis in plants, reduced the level of reactive oxygen species, and alleviated the membrane lipid peroxidation.

The results showed that when the ratio of red to blue light was 4:1, the chlorophyll content, RuBP carboxylase activity, electron transport efficiency of photosynthesis, net photosynthetic rate and growth were all significantly higher than that in control and other treatments, whereas the nitrate content was the lowest. When the ratio of red to blue light was 1:2, the contents of soluble protein, vitamin C, secondary metabolites such as anthocyanins, flavonoids, total phenolic compounds, and the contents of antioxidant capacity were significantly higher than those in the control and other treatments. We concluded that adding appropriate ratios of red to blue light to the white light could increase photosynthesis and improve commercial quality of purple lettuce.",

The results showed that there were significant differences in growth of tomato seedlings under treatments of different proportions of R and B light. The plant height, specific leaf area and intercellular CO concentration of tomato seedlings were significantly promoted by R light, while F/F and \u03c7 were decreased, the root growth was inhibited as the root activity declined, so that the seedling index was reduced. The seedling growth was significantly suppressed under B light and the chlorophyll content was decreased, while the chlorophyll a/b was enhanced. Furthermore, combination of R+B light was be-neficial to the growth and development of tomato seedlings, and the plant dry mass, chlorophyll content and photosynthetic performance were significantly increased under 3R1B. In addition, seedlings grew strongly and had the highest value of seedling index under this treatment. In conclusion, the combination of R+B light could promote photosynthetic pigment content and photosynthetic efficiency in leaves of tomato seedlings, as well as plant growth, especially for treatment of 3R1B.",

The biochars were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), and nitrogen sorption (BET) before and after modification. The adsorption properties of the modified biochars for Cd (II) were investigated in detail via adsorption isotherm models, adsorption kinetics models, and selective adsorption experiments. The surfaces of the cystamine-modified biochars with granular nanopolymers of sufficient functional groups of primary amine and disulfide linkage rendered the biochar surface more conducive to electrostatic attraction and surface complexation. The theoretical maximum adsorption capacity of the modified biochars (81.02 mg g) was almost 10-fold greater than that of the raw biochars (8.347 mg g) for Cd (II). Besides, the cystamine-modified biochars had a better affinity for Cd (II) compared to other heavy metals (Zn, As, Cd, Co, Ni, Cr), showing six-fold greater affinity for Cd (II) than Zn. The results of this study indicate that the modification of biochars derived from rice husks shows great potential in the removal of Cd (II) from contaminated water.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Light qualities are thought to affect many plant physiological processes during growth and development. To investigate how light qualities influence tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) seedlings, the present study evaluated the effects of different light qualities generated by light emitting diodes (LEDs) with the same photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), including monochromic light red (657\u00a0nm, R), blue (457\u00a0nm, B), purple (417\u00a0nm, P) or white (W), combination of R and B lights (R:B\u00a0=\u00a01:1, 1R1B and R:B\u00a0=\u00a03:1, 3R1B) on the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), growth rate, carbohydrate content and sucrose-metabolizing enzyme activities. The results showed that relative to W, the seedling plant height and stem diameter were significantly promoted by combination of R and B lights and monochromic R light. However, the level of root growth was lower under R and P light, and the seedling growth and Pn were significantly suppressed under the latter. Additionally, R light significantly increased the contents of fructose and glucose, and combination of R and B lights significantly enhanced total carbohydrate, starch and sucrose accumulation, especially for 3R1B treatment. Activity of sucrose synthase (SS) was promoted under the different treatments and reached its highest value under 3R1B, which appeared to be a major contributor to the significantly higher content of starch under this treatment. Furthermore, R, B and P light reduced activity of sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS). Activities of acid invertase (AI) and neutral invertase (NI) were significantly increased by R light, but were markedly reduced under P. The results presented here indicated that monochromic R and combination lights 3R1B, could regulate the plant morphology and photosynthesis by the effects on the metabolism of carbohydrate into fructose, glucose, sucrose and starch, mainly through the enhanced activities of AI and NI under the former treatment, while SS and SPS in the latter treatment, respectively. They also improved the end-product output in tomato leaves, and may ultimately improve the yield and quality of tomato fruit.",

        "abstract": "Plant phospholipase D (PLD), which can hydrolyze membrane phospholipids to produce phosphatidic acid (PA), a secondary signaling molecule, has been proposed to function in diverse plant stress responses. In this research, a qRT-PCR analysis indicated that the expression of a cucumber phospholipase D alpha gene (CsPLD\u03b1) was induced by salt and drought stresses in the roots and leaves. To further study the roles of CsPLD\u03b1 in regulating plant tolerance to salt, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and abscisic acid (ABA) stresses, transgenic tobacco plants constitutively overexpressing CsPLD\u03b1 were produced. A qRT-PCR analysis showed that the CsPLD\u03b1 transcript levels were high in transgenic tobacco lines, whereas no expression was found in wild type (WT) tobacco, indicating that CsPLD\u03b1 was successfully transferred into the tobacco genome and overexpressed. Under normal conditions for 30 d, seeds of transgenic lines germinated neatly, and the seedlings were robust and bigger than WT plants. When treated with different concentrations of NaCl, PEG and ABA, germination rates and seedling sizes of the transgenic lines were significantly greater than WT. In addition, the germination times for transgenic lines were also remarkably shorter. Further studies indicated that transgenic lines had longer primary roots and more biomass accumulation than WT plants. The water loss in transgenic lines was also much lower than in WT. These findings suggest that the CsPLD\u03b1 overexpression positively regulates plant tolerance to hyperosmotic stresses, and that CsPLD\u03b1 is involved in the ABA regulation of stomatal closure and the alleviation of ABA inhibition on seed germination and seedling growth.",

        "abstract": "Melatonin (MT) plays integral roles in regulating several biological processes including plant growth, seed germination, flowering, senescence, and stress responses. This study investigated the effects of MT on adventitious root formation (ARF) of de-rooted tomato seedlings. Exogenous MT positively or negatively influenced ARF, which was dependent on the concentration of MT application. In the present experiment, 50 \u03bcM MT showed the best effect on inducing ARF. Interestingly, exogenous MT promoted the accumulation of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) by down-regulating the expression of S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR). To determine the interaction of MT and NO in ARF, MT synthesis inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine, NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide potassium salt as well as GSNOR-overexpression plants with low NO levels were used. The function of MT was removed by NO scavenger or GSNOR-overexpression plants. However, application of MT synthesis inhibitor did little to abolish the function of NO. These results indicate that NO, as a downstream signal, was involved in the MT-induced ARF. Concentrations of indole-3-acetic acid and indole-3-butyric acid, as well as the expression of several genes related to the auxin signaling pathway (PIN1, PIN3, PIN7, IAA19, and IAA24), showed that MT influenced auxin transport and signal transduction as well as auxin accumulation through the NO signaling pathway. Collectively, these strongly suggest that elevated NO levels resulting from inhibited GSNOR activity and auxin signaling were involved in the MT-induced ARF in tomato plants. This can be applied in basic research and breeding. ",

In the present study, we found that the effect of exogenous SA depended on the concentration and 75\u202f\u03bcM SA showed the best remission effect on cucumber plants under alkaline stress. The effect of 75\u202f\u03bcM SA on detailed change of photosynthetic capacity, reactive oxygen metabolism and ionic homeostasis in alkaline-treated cucumber plants were further investigated. Alkaline stress significantly caused ion imbalance, decreased photosynthetic pigment content, inhibited PSII activity and net photosynthetic rate. With prolonging stress time, electrolyte leakage, MDA and H 2 O 2  contents were significantly increased in cucumber leaves, while antioxidative enzymes activity and ascorbate-glutathione cycle increased first and then decreased. Application of 75\u202f\u03bcM SA reduced Na +  accumulation, maintained ionic homeostasis and normal operation of photosystem, enhanced the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging system, reduced oxidative damage, and alleviated lipid peroxidation, thereby improved the alkaline-tolerance of cucumber plants.",

        "abstract": " S-adenosylmethionine synthetase is a member of the stress-induced family genes. Our previous research indicated that overexpression of SlSAMS1 confers alkali stress tolerance to tomato seedlings. However, information regarding the alkali stress tolerance mechanism of SlSAMS1 and the cross-linked network between SlSAMS1 and downstream signal has been limited. To study how SlSAMS1 improves alkali stress tolerance, we manipulated the SlSAMS1 transgenic calluses through a pharmacological approach and found that overexpression of SlSAMS1 was positively correlated with polyamine (PA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulation leading to improve alkali stress tolerance. Additionally, the accumulation of H2O2 in SlSAMS1 overexpression calluses depended on polyamine oxidase activity. The activities of antioxidant system, accumulation of organic acid, Na+ detoxification as well as alkali stress tolerance of the SlSAMS1 transgenic calluses were reversed by PA biosynthesis inhibitors, but not significantly influenced by ethylene biosynthesis inhibitors. These results suggest that overexpression of SlSAMS1 enhances alkali stress tolerance through PA and H2O2 cross-linked networks, which provide new insight into how SlSAMS1 functions as a stress mediatory element in regulating plants tolerance to alkali stress.",

        "abstract": "In China, nitrogen fertilizer application rates in intensive agricultural systems have increased dramatically in recent years, especially in protected vegetable production systems. This excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer has resulted in soil secondary salinization, which has become a significant environmental stress for crops such as cucumber, in the protected farmland of China. So it is necessary to illuminate how crops respond to nitrate stress. The objective of this work was to examine the effects of increased nitrate concentration [14 (CK) and 140 mmol L-1 (T)] on NO3- concentration, and in vitro and in vivo nitrate reductase activities in the roots and leaves of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L. cv. Xintaimici) seedlings with hydroponic culture. The results showed that the NO3- concentration in the roots and leaves of T seedlings significantly increased over treatment course, and at 12 d increased by 1.08 and 1.72 times with respect to CK seedlings, respectively; in vitro nitrate reductase activity of T was increased dramatically to 1.74 times of CK in the roots at 2 d and 1.56 times of CK in the leaves at 6 d, and then decreased. At 12 d, in vitro activity was still 24.3% higher in the roots and only 9.9% lower in the leaves than CK. Compared with in vitro nitrate reductase activity, in vivo activity responded differently to the increase of treatment time. At the beginning, in vivo nitrate reductase activity in the roots and leaves of T had no significant difference from CK, whereas with the increase of treatment duration, the activity decreased. At 12 d, in vivo activity in the roots and leaves of T lowered by 20.1 and 52.8% with respect to CK, respectively. This evidence suggests that posttranslational activation of nitrate reductase in cucumber seedlings may be seriously inhibited by nitrate stress.",

However, limited comprehensive genomic and functional analyses of these genes in eggplant ( Solanum melongena  L.) have been performed. In this study, 73  R2R3MYB  genes were identified in the recently released eggplant genome and further classified into 20 subgroups based on the phylogenetic analysis of their complete protein sequences. Phylogenetic comparisons of this superfamily\u2019s members among eggplant, tomato,  Arabidopsis , grape, rice, poplar, soybean, cucumber and apple revealed that the putative functions of some of the eggplant R2R3MYB proteins were clustered into the  Arabidopsis  functional clades. The tissue specificity or differential expression of  SmR2R3MYBs  in different tissues suggested the differential regulation of tissue development as well as metabolism. The transcript abundance analysis under abiotic stress identified a group of  R2R3MYB  genes that responded to one or more treatments, suggesting that  SmR2R3MYBs  played major roles in the plants response to abiotic stress and were involved in signal transduction pathways. Genes related to anthocyanin synthesis were also identified. This study not only provides a solid foundation for the functional dissection of the eggplant  R2R3MYB  gene family, but may also be useful for the future synthesis of anthocyanins in eggplant.",

In this research, we characterized the roles of the cucumber phospholipase D alpha gene (PLD\u03b1, GenBank accession number EF363796) in growth and tolerance to short- and long-term salt stress in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). Fresh and dry weights of roots, PLD activity and content, mitogen activated protein kinase gene expression, Na+\u2013K+ homeostasis, expression of genes encoding ion exchange, reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism and osmotic adjustment substances were investigated in wild type and CsPLD\u03b1 overexpression (OE) tobacco lines grown under short- and long-term high salt (250 mM) stress. Under short-term stress (5 h), in both OE lines, the PA content, and the expression levels of mitogen activated protein kinase and several genes related to ion exchange (NtNHX1, NtNKT1, NtHAK1, NtNHA1, NtVAG1), were promoted by high PLD activity. Meanwhile, the Na+/K+ ratio decreased. Under long-term stress (16 d), ROS scavenging systems (SOD, POD, CAT and APX activities) in leaves of transgenic lines were more active than those in wild type plants. Meanwhile, the contents of proline, soluble sugar and soluble protein significantly increased. In contrast, the contents of O2\u2022\u2212 and H2O2, the electrolytic leakage and the accumulation of malondialdehyde in leaves significantly decreased. The root fresh and dry weights of the OE lines increased significantly. Na+\u2013K+ homeostasis had the same trend as under the short-term treatment. These findings suggested that CsPLD\u03b1-produced PA can activate the downstream signals\u2019 adaptive response to alleviate the damage of salt stress, and the main strategies for adaptation to salt stress are the accumulation of osmoprotective compounds, maintaining Na+\u2013K+ homeostasis and the scavenging of ROS, which function in the osmotic balancing and structural stabilization of membranes.",

        "abstract": "Nitrate reductase is a key enzyme in the overall process of nitrate assimilation by plants. A full-length cDNA clone encoding nitrate reductase (NR; EC 1.6.6.1) was isolated from cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) by RT-PCR and RACE techniques. The NR of cucumber (CsNR), a full-length cDNA sequence of 3032\u00a0bp contains an open reading frame of 2748\u00a0bp encoding 915 amino acids. The deduced 915 amino acid sequence showed high identities with NR from other plants. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that CsNR expression was different in root, stem, leaf, flower and mature fruit tissues. CsNR transcript level and nitrate reductase activity (NRA) was down-regulated and the change in NO3 \u2212 concentration showed a negative trend with NRA in leaves when subjected to the 182\u00a0mM NO3 \u2212 treatment. However, the CsNR transcript level was up-regulated in roots by 182\u00a0mM NO3 \u2212 treatment. Furthermore, NRA in roots lagged behind CsNR expression and there was no obvious lag of NRA in leaves. This study found that in roots, there was no obvious relationship between NRA and NO3 \u2212 content. These results indicated that NRA was not only controlled by the level of CsNR mRNA and there was an obvious negative relationship between NO3 \u2212 content and NRA in leaves but not in roots.",

Results: Child's daily life, condition management effort, family life difficulty, parental mutuality, living in urban area, employed mother, duration of condition (<1 year) and diagnosis (renal disorder or genetic condition) were predictors of family functioning. Conclusion: Family management is an important determinant of family functioning. Improving the key aspects of family management may directly affect family functioning.",

Method Total RNAs from normal and disease patients were isolated using Trizol BD. cDNA was produced by SMART RT-PCR. SSH was used to obtain genes associated with kidney-yin deficiency of IgA nephropathy by comparing blood cDNA of patients with kidney-yin deficiency of IgA nephropathy (as Tester or Driver) with normal blood cDNA (as Tester or Driver). After Rsa\u2160 enzyme digestion, Tester cDNA was divided into two groups for the ligation with the specific adaptor l and adaptor 2. Tester cDNAs were hybridized with Driver cDNA twice and then nested PCR twice. The PCR product was ligated with Uplasmid vectors, transformed into E.coli TOP10 and screened through the blue-white screening system. Positive recombinant clones were confirmed by PCR. Result cDNA subtractive library was successfully produced. 325 clones were obtained from the forward subtractive library and 306 clones were obtained from the reverse subtractive library. Conclusion SSH can be used for the rapid isolation of differentially expressed cDNA. The cDNA subtractive library may be used for cloning the genes involving kidney-yin deficiency in patient with IgA nephropathy.",

        "abstract": "Objective To demonstrate the influence of the linezolid\u2032s adverse events, especially the thrombocytopenia, and compare the safety and efficacy of linezolid and vancomycin in patients after liver transplantation. Method One prospective, randomized, comparative-controlled clinical study was conducted. Eighty-five patients who did the liver transplantation were enrolled between September 2007 and June 2009. Palates counts, cumulative incidence of substantially low platelet counts among patients, two drugs\u2032 efficacy were measured and compared on day 3, day 5, day 7, at the end of treatment, or at follow-up for 44 linezolid and 40 vancomycin recipients. Results There was no relationship between thrombocytopenia and duration of treatment. When prolonged the treatment, the decrease trend with the platelet was not distinct and also has no significant difference between the two groups. Before the therapy and at the end of treatment the platelet counts in linezolid group were (71.25\u00b111.01)\u00d7109/L vs (86.74\u00b111.60)\u00d7109/L respectively, whereas in vancomycin group there were (62.0\u00b119.11) \u00d7109/L vs (85.2\u00b112.73)\u00d7109/L. Percentage of patients treated for \u22655 days who had \u22651 substantially low platelet count during the study was similar between treatment groups, 1(2.3%) of 44 linezolid recipients and 1(2.5%) of 40 vancomycin recipients, whereas one-half of all patients experienced increases or no change of percentage change in platelet count, including 20 linezolid recipients(45%) and 19 vancomycin recipients (47%). Besides, the efficacy and safety between this two groups didn\u2019t have significant difference. Conclusions Clinically significant thrombocytopenia is uncommon in our analysis, and linezolid is not associated with a greater risk of thrombocytopenia in liver transplantation patients than is vancomycin.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the safety of fluid resuscitation with 6% hydroxyethyl starch(HES 130/0.4) for patients with shock during surgical perioperative period. Methods Clinical data of 279 patients with shock during surgical perioperative period in Department of Surgical Intensive Care Unit(SICU), the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from March 2009 to December 2012 wereanalyzed retrospectively. The informed consents of all patients were obtained and the ethical committee approval was received. The patients were divided into HES group and albumin group according to whether they were resuscitated with 6% HES 130/0.4 within 48 hours of shock. There were 168 patients in HES group [109 males and 59 females, age of(64\u00b117) years old], and 111 patients in albumin group[72 males and 39 females, age of(63\u00b116) years old]. All patients received anti-shock therapy immediately after they were admitted in SICU. In HES group, 6% HES 130/0.4 was administered by intravenous infusion as the main colloid supplement, while albumin was administered in albumin group. The mortality, acute renal injury, new-onset function failure of other organs and adverse events of skin in two groups were observed. The comparison of measurement data between two groups was conducted using t test or rank sum test, and comparison of enumeration data was conducted using Chi-square test. Results The mortality was 17.9%(30/168) in HES group, and 17.1%(19/111) in albumin group. There was no significant difference between two groups( \u03c7 2 =2.01,P >0.05). In HES group, 54.8%(92/168) of the patients were in renal injury risk period, 34.5%(58/168) of the patients were in renal injury period and 10.7%(18/168) of the patients were in renal failure period, while those were 55.0%(61/111),35.1%(39/111) and 9.9%(11/111) respectively in albumin group. There was no significant difference( \u03c7 2 =1.98,1.82,1.04;P>0.05). Renal-replacement therapy was used in 11.3% of the patients(19/168) in HES group, and that was 8.1%(9/111) accordingly in albumin group. There was no significant difference between two groups( \u03c7 2 =20.23,P <0.05). The incidences of respiratory system and hematologic system failure were 26.8%(45/168), 5.4%(9/168) respectively in HES group and 25.2%(28/111), 5.4%(6/111) accordingly in albumin group. There was no significant difference between two groups(\u03c7 2 =1.07,2.30;P>0.05). Compared with albumin group, the incidence of cardiovascular system failure significantly decreased in HES group [39.6%(44/111) vs. 36.3%(61/168); \u03c7 2 =43.71, P<0.05], while the incidence of liver failure significantly increased in HES group [1.8%(2/111) vs. 2.4%(4/168); \u03c7 2 =17.25, P<0.05]. Erythema, rash and pruritus were the common adverse events in two groups. The incidence of skin adverse events was 4.8%(8/168) in HES group, and 4.5%(5/111)in albumin group. There was no significant difference between two groups( \u03c7 2 =1.78,P>0.05). Conclusion Fluid resuscitation with 6% HES(130/0.4) for patients with shock during surgical perioperative period cannot reduce the mortality but can increase the probability of patients receiving the renal-replacement therapy.",

Methods Clinical data of 300 patients who underwent LT from January 2007 to August 2013 in Liver Transplantation Center, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University were retrospectively analyzed. The informed consents of all participating subjects were obtained and the localethical committee approval had been received. According to whether the patients developed AKI after operation, the patients were divided into AKI group(n=93, 83 males and 10 females, age: 24-72 years old, median age of 48 years old) and non-AKI group(n=207, 183 males and 24 females, age: 20-75 years old, median age of 48 years old). The hospital mortality of two groups and mortality of patients with different stages in AKI group were observed. The differences of clinical parameters such as preoperative serum albumin(ALB), serum creatinine(Scr), glomerular filtration rate(GFR), model for end-stage liver disease with serum sodium( MELD-Na) score, intraoperative blood loss and transfusion, cold ischemia time, anhepatic period, duration of operation and development of sepsis after operation of two groups were compared. And the differences of clinical parameters of patients with different stages in AKI group were further compared. The comparison of normal distribution data was performed using t test and one-way analysis of variance. The comparison of non-normal distribution data was performed using rank sum test. The comparison of ratio was performed using Chi-square test. Results The hospital mortality was 12%(11/93) in AKI group, and was 5%(10/207) in non-AKI group, where significant difference was observed( \u03c72=4.826, P<0.05). The mortality of patients in AKI group in risk stage, injury stage, failure stage were 3%(1/39), 15%(5/33), 33%(7/21) respectively with a gradual upward trend( \u03c72=10.806,P<0.05). The development of AKI was related with preoperative ALB, Scr, GFR, MELD-Na score, intraoperative blood loss and transfusion(t=-11.7, t=7.88, t=-4.37, Z=7.1, Z=10.0, t=3.89; P<0.05). The incidence of postoperative sepsis was 22%(20/93) in AKI group, and was 13%(27/207) in non-AKI group, where significant difference was observed( \u03c72=4.157, P<0.05). The development of acute kidney failure in AKI group was related with preoperative Scr, GFR, MELD-Na score, intraoperative blood loss and transfusion( F =18.31, F =7.03, H=22.49, H=6.58, H=8.68; P<0.05). Conclusions The mortality of patients with AKI after LT is high. The development of AKI after LT is related with preoperative ALB, renal function, MELD-Na score, intraoperative blood loss and transfusion. Perioperative monitoring should be enhanced to prevent AKI.",

The prevention should be emphasized on decreasing the risk factors of DIC, such as: appropriate collocation of blood product transfusion, anti-inflammatory therapy, and correction of hypothermia, acidosis, massive hemorrhage, infection, blood stasis and so on. When DIC occurs, blood product and heparin could be used in condition, in the basis of treatment of primary diseases. AT and APC could be administered when DIC complicates with sepsis.

All patients received nucleoside analogues therapy formally before entering into the waiting list and nucleoside analogues combined low-dose HBIG therapy during and after transplantation. Patients were regularly followed up at the outpatient, monitoring the HBV recurrence and survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the risk factors for hepatitis recurrence.33 patients suffered from HBV recurrence post transplantation. The 1-, 3- and 5- year recurrence rates were 7.0%, 10% and 13% respectively. The median HBV recurrence time was 5 months (1-21 months). COX regression analysis revealed that risk factors for HBV recurrence were HCC (HR = 2.98; 95% CI 1.08-8.25; P < 0.05) and pre-transplantation HBV-DNA load over 5 log10 copies/ml (HR = 3.99; 95% CI 1.85-8.62; P < 0.01). Further stratified analysis showed that patients who suffered from carcinoma recurrence had a higher incidence of HBV recurrence than those who did not, which were 27.9% and 8.7% (HR = 4.58;95% CI 1.88-11.12; P < 0.01) respectively. 12 patients suffered from both HCC and HBV recurrence. Spearman correlation analysis demonstrated a strong correlation between HBV and HCC recurrence times (r = 0.583, P < 0.05).Post transplantation HCC recurrence is a risk factor for HBV recurrence.",

        "abstract": "Many studies showed that benzodiazepines could modulate immune responses through interaction with peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) in immune cells but most of the studies were focused on monocytes and macrophages. In the present study, we revealed that diazepam, a mixed-type benzodiazepine, inhibited IFN-gamma production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) induced by anti-CD3 in dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that diazepam could inhibit the frequency of IFN-gamma-producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. The inhibitory effect of diazepam on IFN-gamma production is similar to that of R(0)5-4864, a selective PBRs ligand. However, D8555, a selective ligand for PBRs in microglia in the central nervous system, is a much weak inhibitor compared with R(0)5-4864 or diazepam. The inhibitory effect of R(0)5-4864 could be antagonized by PK11195, which is recognized as selective PBRs antagonist, and suppressive effect of diazepam on T cells is partially antagonized by PK11195. Collectively, these results suggested that diazepam suppressed human T cell function through PBRs.",

Methods: The improved steam distillated method was used to isolated the essential oil of Schizonepeta tenuifo-lia Briq. Tween-80 was used to dissolve the essential oil and diluted by saline. The human lung cancer cell line A549 was applied in this study. The anti-tumor effect was assayed by the SRB method and the inducing-apoptosis as assayed by hochest33258 stain. The experiment groups were divided into the time-dependence group (24h, 48h, 72h) and the dose-dependence group (0.25 mg/ml - 16 mg/ml). Results: 4 mg/ml or more of essential oil in Schizonepeta tenuifo-lia Briq obviously inhibited the growth of A549 with the highest inhibitive rate being 91.2% while the minimum inhibitive dose was 1 mg/ml with the rate being 43.3%. According to the morphological observation, the atrophy of necrotic cells and the number of the surviving cells in the experiment groups were lower than in the control groups. More over, the best effect were achieved at the time of 48 h and 72 h, and obvious effect on inducing cell apoptosis of oil were found for dose between 0.25 mg/ml and 1 mg/ml in 72h. Conclusions: The high dose (4 mg/ml-16 mg/ml) of essential oil in Schizonepeta tenuifo-lia Briq can kill the cells of human lung cancer A549, and the low dose can inducing its apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "This study aims at carrying out a content analysis related to the application of econometric methods in tourism research.To accomplish this objective,the paper analyzed the contents of 122 relevant articles published in two leading tourism journals: Annals of Tourism Research(ATM)(1974-2005) and Tourism Management(TM)(1980-2005).The results show that econometric methods have been increasingly used in tourism research abroad.Specifically,regression models are the most commonly used method followed by time series analysis models and panel data models.It was found that 68 articles focused on tourism demand research.In contrast,only 20 investigated the supply side of tourism.Approximately a quarter of the 122 articles examined in the present study explored into the causal relationships between tourism expansion and economic,social,and environmental development.It appears that the use of econometric methods in tourism research has gradually advanced from static and sporadic applications to dynamic and integrated applications in the past three decades.",

        "abstract": "We report on a biosensor for organophosphate pesticides (OPs) by exploiting their inhibitory effect on the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). A boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode was modified with a nanocomposite prepared from carbon spheres (CSs; with an average diameter of 500\u00a0nm) that were synthesized from resorcinol and formaldehyde, and then were coated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) by chemically growing them of the CSs. Compared to a bare BDD electrode, the electron transfer resistance is lower on this new electrode. Compared to an electrode without Au-NPs, the peak potential is negatively shifted by 42\u00a0mV, and the peak current is increased by 55\u00a0%. This is ascribed to the larger surface in the AuNP-CS nanocomposite which improves the adsorption of AChE, enhances its activity, and facilitates electrocatalysis. Under optimum conditions, the inhibitory effect of chlorpyrifos is linearly related to the negative log of its concentration in the 10\u221211 to 10\u22127\u00a0M range, with a detection limit of 1.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221213\u00a0M. For methyl parathion, the inhibition effect is linear in the 10\u221212 to 10\u22126\u00a0M range, and the detection limit is 4.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221213\u00a0M. The biosensor exhibits good precision and acceptable operational and temporal stability.",

        "abstract": "In this work, a novel aptamer-based electrochemical biosensor was developed for the determination of Ochratoxin A (OTA) by using carbon aerogels (CAs) and methylene blue (MB) as signal amplification strategy. CAs was used as carrier to load the abundant of complementary DNA (cDNA), which could enhance the hybridization between CAs-cDNA and aptamer immobilized on the electrode surface, thus provide more double-stranded DNA for MB intercalation. The current of MB on the CAs-cDNA/apt/AuE sensor was twice that on the cDNA/apt/AuE sensor, which indicated that the CAs with high surface area enabled a higher loading of the cDNA and absorbed more MB, thus realized the signal amplification strategy. The optimum experimental conditions including MB incubation time of 15\u00a0min, aptamer concentration of 4.0\u00a0\u03bcmol/L, hybridization time of 2.0\u00a0h, and OTA incubation time of 18\u00a0min were obtained. The change of peak current was linearly proportional to the OTA concentration in the range of 0.10-10\u00a0ng/mL with the actual detection limit of 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u00a0ng/mL. The experimental results showed that the prepared CAs-cDNA/apt/AuE exhibited good specificity, acceptable reproducibility and repeatability. This sensor was applied to detect OTA in the spiked corn samples, and obtained an acceptable average recovery of 89%.",

        "abstract": "The authors describe a fluorometric method for improving the determination of the cancer biomarker 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). A nicking endonuclease (NEase)-powered 3-D DNA nanomachine was constructed by assembling hundreds of carboxyfluorescein-labeled single strand oligonucleotides (acting as signal reporter) and tens of swing arms (acting as single-foot DNA walkers) on a gold nanoparticle (AuNP). The activity of this DNA nanomachine was controlled by introducing the protecting oligonucleotides. In the presence of aptamer against 8-OHdG, the protecting oligonucleotides are removed from the swing arms by toehold-mediated strand displacement reaction. In the next step, detached DNA walker hybridizes to the labelled DNA so that the DNA nanomachine becomes activated. Special sequences of signal reporter in the formed duplex can be recognized and cleaved by NEase. As a result, the DNA walker autonomously and progressively moves along the surface of the AuNP, thereby releasing hundreds of signal reporters and causing a rapid increase in green fluorescence. This 3-D nanomachine is highly efficient because one aptamer can release hundreds of signal reporters. These unique properties allowed for the construction of a DNA nanomachine-based method for sensitively detecting 8-OHdG in concentrations as low as 4 pM. This is three orders of magnitude lower compared to previously reported methods. Graphical abstract Schematic of a fluorometric method for determination of the cancer biomarker 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. A nicking endonuclease powered 3D-DNA nanomachine was used to improve the sensitivity. Limit of detection is three orders of magnitude lower than reported methods.",

        "abstract": "Telomerase, a widely accepted cancer biomarker for early cancer diagnostics, is considered as an important therapeutic target. To now, it is still a challenging subject to develop a simple and sensitive strategy for telomerase activity detection. Herein, we reported a simple colorimetric strategy for label-free quantification of human telomerase activity in urine by using hemin-graphene nanomaterial (H-GNs). H-GNs possessed tailored dispersibility in the high salt concentration and highly active biomimetic oxidation catalyst property. In this strategy, H-GNs were adjusted to coagulate to appropriate degree by carefully selecting the contained NaCl amount in the presence of original TS primer. The supernatant of the solution contained few H-GNs and showed light blue color. Under the action of telomerase, TS primer was elongated with repeating sequences of (TTAGGG). These negatively charged DNA enhanced individual H-GNs electrostatic repulsion and resisted salt-induced H-GNs coagulation. As a result, the supernate of the corresponding solution containing more dispersed H-GNs and showed dark blue color after chromogenic reaction. Thus, telomerase activity could be quasi-quantified by naked eye and precise quantified by UV spectrometer. The proposed method has the linear range from 100 to 2300 HeLa cells/mL and the detection limit was 60 cells/mL. It has been successfully applied to detect telomerase activity in real urine samples. Obtained results were in good agreement with the clinical diagnosis. Therefore, this colorimetric approach affords simplicity, sensitivity and reliability in telomerase activity detection.",

        "abstract": "Telomerase has become one of the most typical tumor marker because it is closely related to cancers. In this paper, a simple label-free electrochemical detection of telomerase activity by using methylene blue (MB) as a G-quadruplex binding probe was proposed, avoiding commonly used complex label procedures, nano-probe synthesis, complicated electrode modification, probe immobilization or signal amplification. In the presence of telomerase substrate (TS) primer, the binding of MB on primer was weak. When repeats of (TTAGGG) were extended on the TS primer under the action of telomerase, they formed multiple G-quadruplexes with the help of K. As a result, a large amount of MB bounded to multiple G-quadruplexes because they have more strong interaction with G-quadruplexes than TS primer. As a result, the diffusion current of MB decreased sharply, which was strongly dependent on the telomerase activity. The DPV current change has a linear correlation with the logarithm of HeLa cell number in the range of 10-10,000 cells, with the detection limit of 3 cells. The high sensitivity was due to the formed multiple G-quadruplexes. Using indium tin oxide (ITO) as working electrode without modification ensured the good reproducibility of the method. The method was also simple, rapid, and has been successfully applied in the telomerase activity detection in urine with good selectivity and reproducibility, which is significant for cancer diagnosis, anticancer drugs screening, and cancer therapy evaluation.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in the regulation of cellular activities and are next-generation biomarkers for early cancer detection. Simultaneous monitoring of multiplexed miRNA is very important for enhancing the accuracy of cancer diagnostics. Traditional fluorescence methods for multicomponent analysis were usually operated under multiple excitation wavelengths, because spectral crosstalk is very detrimental to detecting accuracy for multicomponent analysis. Herein, we present a fluorescence strategy for multi-miRNAs detection in plasma under a single excitation wavelength. Nucleic acid stain TOTO-1 and three labeled fluorescence dyes Cy3, Cy3.5, and Cy5 emit no fluorescence in their free state. Target miRNA hybridized the auxiliary and probe oligonucleotides into duplex nucleic acid. Intercalation interaction localized TOTO-1 and labeled dyes into the duplex nucleic acid. As a result, TOTO-1 emitted strong fluorescence and efficient F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) happened. MicroRNAs miRNA-155, miRNA-182, and miRNA-197, which are significant for the early diagnosis of lung cancer, were simultaneously detected as models. Deviations from spectral crosstalk in the presence of other miRNAs were corrected by mathematical methods. Results demonstrated that, after spectra crosstalk corrections, every miRNA at high or low concentration in plasma was determined accurately in the presence of either high or low concentrations of the other two miRNAs. This new multiplexed assay for miRNAs is promising for clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring of early-stage lung cancer.",

        "abstract": "Early diagnosis and life-long surveillance are clinically important to improve the long-term survival of cancer patients. Telomerase activity is a valuable biomarker for cancer diagnosis, but its measurement often used complex label procedures. Herein, we designed a novel, simple, visual and label-free method for telomerase detection by using enzymatic etching of gold nanorods (GNRs). First, repeating (TTAGGG) sequences were extented on telomerase substrate (TS) primer. It formed G-quadruplex under the help of Hemin and K. Second, the obtained horseradish peroxidase mimicking hemin/G-quadruplex catalyzed the HO-mediated etching of GNRs to the short GNRs, even to gold nanoparticles (GNPs), generating a series of distinct color changes due to their plasmon-related optical response. Thus, this enzymatic reaction can be easily coupled to telomerase activity, allowing for the detection of telomerase activity based on vivid colors. This can be differentiated sensitively by naked eyes because human eyes are more sensitive to color variations rather than the optical density variations. As a result, telomerase activity can be quantitatively detected ranging from 200 to 15000 HeLa cells mL. The detection limit was 90 HeLa cells mL (S/N = 3). Importantly, the application of this method in bladder cancer samples was in agreement with the clinical results. Thus, this method was considerably suitable for point-of-care diagnostics in resource-constrained regions because of the easy readout of results without the use of sophisticated apparatus.",

In this paper, a simple and sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) aptasensor was constructed to detect OTA based on electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET) and a nicking endonuclease-powered DNA walking machine. Originally, the signal of cadmium sulfide semiconductor quantum dots (CdS QDs) was quenched efficiently by Cy5. After the addition of OTA, the walker autonomously hybridized with Cy5-labeled DNA and released plenty of Cy5-DNA from the electrode surface with the help of a nicking endonuclease. As a result, the signal of CdS QDs recovered efficiently. As an artificial and popular signal amplification technique, the DNA walking machine greatly improved the sensitivity. Under optimal conditions, the aptasensor not only detected OTA in a linear range from 0.05\u202fnM to 5\u202fnM with a detection limit of 0.012\u202fnM (S/N\u202f=\u202f3), but also showed an excellent selectivity for OTA over other mycotoxins.",

DTN, which modified with OTA aptamer on top vertex and thiol group on other three vertices, was constructed on the modified electrode surface via Au-S bond and prominent template for PANI deposition owing to their numerous negative charges. The prepared gold nanorods (AuNRs) was used as a carrier to immobilize DTN and promote electron transfer. In the presence of OTA, the aptamer specific for OTA was formed G-quadruplex structure. The hemin/G-quadruplex was formed when hemin was intercalated into G-quadruplex, which had high catalytic activity to catalyze PANI deposition in the presence of H 2 O 2  and amplify DPV signal. The amount of generated PANI was dependent on the number of hemin/G-quadruplex induced by OTA. Therefore, DPV currents was related to the concentration of OTA. The fabricated aptasensor exhibited a good linear response toward OTA over a wide range of concentrations from 0.001 ng/mL to 0.5 ng/mL, and the limit of detection of the proposed aptasensor was 0.26\u2009pg/mL.",

        "abstract": "In this work, a novel signal-off aptasensor was constructed for the determination of Ochratoxin A (OTA) using differential pulse voltammetry. Methylene blue (MB) was used as an electrochemical indicator by intercalating into a single-stranded aptamer through guanine bases and double-stranded DNA and produced a strong current signal. The prepared carboxylic porous carbon (cPC) and Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) are successively utilized to modify an aminated Au electrode (AuNPs/cPC/NH2\u2013AuE), which not only enables a higher loading of the capture DNA (cDNA), but also effectively enhances the electron transfer between MB and the electrode surface to improve the determination sensitivity. By immobilization of cDNA and hybridization with the aptamer on the AuNPs/cPC/NH2\u2013AuE, the apt/cDNA/AuNPs/cPC/NH2\u2013AuE sensor was constructed. In the presence of OTA, the complex formation between the aptamer and OTA prohibited the binding between cDNA and the aptamer, which led to the release of MB from the electrode surface and a decreased amount of adsorbed MB, producing a lowered electrochemical signal. The change of the MB electrochemical signal can be applied for OTA detection. The linear relationship between the change of peak current and the logarithmic concentration of OTA was observed in the range of 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22126\u20135.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 ng mL\u22121 with a correlation coefficient of 0.999.

In the presence of cholesterol and glucose, H2O2 was produced under the catalytic action of their corresponding enzymes such as glucose oxidase (GOx) or cholesterol oxidase (ChOx), which etched the AgNPs shell of Au@Ag NPs. As a result, their characteristic absorbance at 375 nm decreased, accompanied with a perceptible color change from orange to red, which could be used to detect glucose and cholesterol by the naked eye. Under optimum conditions, the linear ranges for the detection of glucose and cholesterol by UV-vis spectroscopy were from 0.5 to 400 \u03bcM and 0.3 to 300 \u03bcM, respectively. The detection limit of the biosensors for glucose and cholesterol were 0.24 \u03bcM and 0.15 \u03bcM, respectively. The practical applications of this method in urine or human serum have been realized with satisfactory results. This work provides a simple and sensitive approach for glucose and cholesterol detection, which has broad application prospects in clinical diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "A novel aptasensor based on AuNPs\u2013carboxylic porous carbon (cPC) is developed for the ultrasensitive detection of ochratoxin A (OTA) via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The prepared AuNPs\u2013cPC, which combines the porous structure of cPC with the good conductivity of AuNPs, is used as an excellent carrier for the immobilization of capture DNA (cDNA), which enhances the loading of the aptamer and amplifies the impedimetric signal. When the target OTA is present, due to the complex effect of the three-dimensional macroporous structure of the AuNPs\u2013cPC on the immobilization of cDNA, hybridization between the aptamer and cDNA and the conformational change of the OTA-aptamer, the OTA-aptamer complex may not be released from the electrode surface, which leads to an increase in the Rct signal. Through optimization of the important parameters, the optimal aptamer concentration of 10 \u03bcmol L\u22121 and optimal incubation time of 9 min are obtained. Under the optimal conditions, the \u0394Rct is linearly proportional to OTA concentration in a logarithmic way in the range of 1 \u00d7 10\u22128 to 0.1 ng mL\u22121, and the actual limit of detection is 1 \u00d7 10\u22128 ng mL\u22121.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) monitoring has attracted extensive attention because it serves a vital role in human pathologies. However, only a few researches about its detection methods have been reported because PARP-1 and its catalyzed product poly(ADP-ribose) polymer (PAR) are lack of optical or electrochemical activity. Herein, a convenient fluorescence \u201cturn-off-on\u201d nanosensor based on cationic conjugated polymer (PFP) and MnO 2  nanosheets has been designed for selective detection of PARP-1 in vitro. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to use manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ) nanosheets for PARP-1 detection. The fluorescence intensity of PFP can be quenched by MnO 2  nanosheets via a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). While the subsequently joined electronegative poly(ADP-ribose) polymer (PAR), catalysate of PARP-1, take positively charged MnO 2  nanosheets away from PFP via electrostatic interaction, causing sufficient recovery of fluorescent signal. The sensing platform displayed a sensitive response to PARP-1 in a linear range of 0.03\u202f\u2212\u202f1.5 U (0.024\u202f\u2212\u202f1.2\u202fnM), with a detection limit of 0.004 U (0.003\u202fnM), which is 10\u2013100 lower than reported methods. As expected, this method was successfully applied to the detection of PARP-1 in human serum samples with recoveries ranging from 97.6\u202f\u2212\u202f102.7%. Especially, it has also been applied to the determination of PARP-1 in human breast cancer cells SK-BR-3 in the 40 to 1000 cells per mL range, with a detection limit as low as 25 cells per mL.",

Therefore, developing of accurate and visual detection methods for miRNAs is important for early diagnosis of cancer. In this study, we established a visual detection method for miRNA 155 based on DNAzyme amplification strategy in living cells. MnO2 nanosheets were employed to deliver Locked DNAzyme and Substrate DNA into cells. AuNPs-Probe were taken up by cells autonomously. Then, MnO2 nanosheets were reduced to Mn2+ by glutathione (GSH) in cells and DNA modules were released. MiRNA 155 took away Locker DNA by strand displacement reaction to activate the DNAzyme. Then the DNAzyme cleaved substrate DNA and released single-stranded DNA named Key DNA. Key DNA opened the hairpin DNA that modified on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and turn on the fluorescence of cy5. One target miRNA led to plenty of released Key DNA when lots of substrate DNA were added. Thus, the visual detection of miRNA 155 in living cells would be initiated. Under confocal laser microscopy, the fluorescence was obviously observed in tumor cells but not in normal cells. The method has a linear range from 0.1 nM to 10 nM and a low detection limit of 44 pM in vitro detection.",

        "abstract": "Developing a simple and reliable method for the detection of the highly concerning mycotoxin, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), is of great importance to food safety monitoring. In this study, a simple electrochemical aptasensor was presented for the detection of AFB1 based on the host-guest recognition between ferrocene and \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD). Fc-labeled aptamer of AFB1 first hybridized with its complementary Fc-cDNA. Two ferrocene molecules were brought closely together and couldn't enter into the cavity of \u03b2-CD modified on the electrode. Negligible signal could be observed. Once AFB1 captured the aptamer from the AFB1-sensitive dsDNA, Fc-cDNA was released and subsequently entered into the cavity of \u03b2-CD to form inclusion complexes, giving rise to an distinct increase of R and peak current because of the molecular recognition of \u03b2-CD. AC impedance method is more sensitive than DPV method. The electrochemical aptasensor displayed a sensitive response to AFB1 in a wide linear range of 0.1\u202fpg/mL to 10\u202fng/mL, with a low detection limit of 0.049\u202fpg/mL (0.147\u202fpmol/mL) by AC impedance detection, which is 10-100 lower than previously reported methods. The aptasensor has good selectivity and reliability, which has been successfully applied to the determination of AFB1 in real peanut oil samples with recoveries ranging from 94.5% to 106.7% and inter-assay RSD lower than 11.51%.",

        "abstract": "Doping is an effective way to extend the optical absorption of TiO2 to the visible range. Doping of TiO2 by carbon has been found to enhance the water splitting efficiency significantly in experiment. However, the mechanism behind this is elusive. Using the ab initio many-body Green's function theory, we find that the C2 dimer formed on the TiO2 surface produces a shallow delocalized occupied Ti 3d state just below the bottom of the conduction bands. Therefore, band-gap narrowing in carbon-doped TiO2 is caused by the opposite shifts of both valence and conduction bands simultaneously, which is in contrast to the generally accepted idea that anionic dopants can only affect the valence band of TiO2. Optical absorption in the infrared region is also increased compared to reduced TiO2. The spatially well-separated photogenerated electrons and holes might help to reduce the recombination rate of carriers, in favor of improvement in photocatalysis efficiency. This novel behavior of anionic dopants is distinct from previous understandings and may guide the engineering of TiO2.",

        "abstract": "Water clusters are an important species in the environment and atmosphere and take part in various chemical and biological reactions. How their optical properties vary with size is still an open question. Using the GW method and Bethe-Salpeter equation within the ab initio many-body Green's function theory, we study the electronic excitations in a series of water clusters (HO) with n = 1-48. We find that their absorption peaks blueshift with increasing cluster size due to the reducing electron-hole binding energy which arises from the enhanced electronic screening and gradually delocalized excitonic spatial distribution. The position of the first absorption peak has a close relation to the average number of hydrogen bonds per molecule. Off-diagonal matrix elements of the self-energy operator have pronounced effects on the unoccupied electronic levels and optical absorption for small clusters with n \u2264 10 when using density functional theory as the starting point for GW calculations. Although the optical absorption is predominated by delocalized excitons, highly localized excitons on a single water molecule are always present on the cluster surface in the vicinity of the absorption edge. These localized excitons may facilitate the photodissociation of water molecules. This can provide inspiration on the excited-state dynamics and photolysis in water clusters.",

        "abstract": "Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a metal-free two-dimensional photocatalyst, has drawn increasing attention due to its application in photocatalytic water splitting. However, its quantum efficiency is limited by the poor performance of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, it is important to clarify the behavior of photogenerated holes in the OER. In this work, we investigate the energy level alignment using the GW method and the exciton properties using the Bethe-Salpeter equation within the ab initio many-body Green's function theory at the g-C3N4/water interface. We found that the g-C3N4 substrate can elevate energy levels of OH- and H2O molecules at the interface by up to 0.6 eV. This effect can make the electronic levels of OH- surpass the valence band maximum (VBM) of g-C3N4. However, orbital energies of H2O molecules remain far below the VBM of g-C3N4. This indicates that a photogenerated hole after exciting g-C3N4 can relax to OH- instead of neutral H2O. Moreover, OH- could be directly oxidized through electron transfer from OH- to g-C3N4 by light near the optical absorption edge of g-C3N4, which is beneficial for efficient carrier separation at the interface.",

However, the mechanism, especially how photogenerated holes participate in, behind the reaction remains highly debated. It is fundamental to identify the capability of groups at the TiO2/water interface to attract photogenerated holes. In this work, we applied the first-principles many-body Green\u2019s function theory to investigate the behaviors of free photogenerated holes and coupled electron\u2013hole pairs at three kinds of TiO2/water interfaces. Our calculations show that interaction between TiO2 and water elevates their respective valence band edges significantly. The groups derived from water, including Ti\u2013OH, OH\u2013, and H2O, cannot be oxidized by holes from photons at the optical absorption edge of TiO2. With higher-energy UV light, holes may be trapped by Ti\u2013OH and OH\u2013.

This approach employs the accurate wave functions of excitons, which are derived from the Bethe-Salpeter equation, in the donor and acceptor to set up the electronic coupling terms. Dexter coupling, which arises from the exchange-correlation effect, is evaluated based on the GW method which is a state-of-the-art ab initio theory for the description of self-energy. This approach is applicable to various situations, especially for periodic systems. The approach is tested on some model molecular dimers and compared with other high-level quantum chemistry methods together with the exact supermolecule scheme. Finally, we apply it to study the EET between periodic single-walled carbon nanotubes, exploring the dependence of EET on the chirality of nanotubes and the type of excitation transferred, finding that dark states play key roles in the EET between nanotubes. The EET rate falls as \u223cD approximately with the distance D between nanotubes for small D, much faster than the traditional F\u00f6rster model.",

Experiments find that S1 and T1 dissociate at quite different time scales at the donor/acceptor interface. Using the pentacene/TiO2 heterojunction as the model, we investigate the dissociation of pentacene excitons by a combination of many-body Green\u2019s function theory and the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. Singlet and higher-energy triplet (Tn) excitons of pentacene could dissociate at the same timescale of \u223c100 fs, benefiting from their capability to scatter into charge-transfer (CT) states and weakly bound charge-separated (CS) states across the interface. Resonance of pentacene excitons with CS states could facilitate the creation of free charge carriers. However, dissociation of T1 is hampered due to its poor density of states projected onto the interfacial states, preventing its scattering into C...",

        "abstract": "Room-temperature Na-ion batteries (NIBs) have been generally expected to offer a hopeful perspective for renewable energy storage applications on a large scale. However, a shortage of appropriate anode materials for NIBs has hindered their large-scale applications. Here, we report the strong chemical bonding of tin sulfide on amino-functionalized graphene that is prepared by a facile amine-thermal reaction. In contrast to previous reports on graphene-based composite electrodes, our strategy has the following merits: the one-step formation of amino-functionalized reduced grapheme oxide (RGO) from GO and tight contact of SnS2 nanocrystals at an amino-functionalized graphene interface. This concept has been demonstrated by experimental results which are in congruence with first principles theoretical calculations. When investigated as an anode material for NIBs, the composite maintained a capacity of 680 mA h g\u22121 after cycling for 100 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g\u22121, and 480 mA h g\u22121 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g\u22121. The outstanding performance results from the unique structure of the hybrid nanosheets.",

This study combined internal transcribed spacer region sequencing and quantitative\u00a0real-time\u00a0polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to investigate the ambient fungi in fine (PM 2.\u20095 , 50  % cutoff aerodynamic diameter  D  a50 \u2009=\u2009  2.5  \u00b5m, geometric standard deviation of collection efficiency  \u03c3   g  \u2009=\u2009  1.2) and submicron (PM 1 ,  D  a50 \u2009=\u2009  1  \u00b5m,  \u03c3   g  \u2009=\u2009  1.2) particles at the summit of Mt.\u00a0Tai located in the North China Plain, China. Fungal abundance values were 9.4  \u2009\u00d7\u2009  10 4  and 1.3  \u2009\u00d7\u2009  10 5  copies  m \u22123  in PM 2.\u20095  and PM 1 , respectively. Most of the fungal sequences were from Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, which are known to actively discharge spores into the atmosphere. The fungal community showed a significant seasonal shift across different size fractions according to Metastats analysis and the Kruskal\u2013Wallis rank sum test. The abundance of  Glomerella  and  Zasmidium  increased in larger particles in autumn, whereas  Penicillium ,  Bullera , and  Phaeosphaeria  increased in smaller particles in winter. Environmental factors, namely Ca 2+ , humidity, and temperature, were found to be crucial for the seasonal variation in the fungal community. This study might serve as an important reference for fungal contribution to primary biological aerosol particles.",

        "abstract": "The North China Plain is the agricultural heartland in China. High PM levels and elevated chemical pollutants have been observed during crop harvest seasons due to open biomass burning. Biomass burning in the wheat-harvest season may significantly deteriorate the regional air quality. The harmful ingredients in smoke particles also have severe implications for toxicity and health effects. Previous studies have illustrated the potential role of bioaerosols as ice-nuclei and cloud condensation nuclei and highlighted their influence on biochemical cycles and human health effects. In a monthly field observation campaign of biomass burning conducted at the summit of Mount Tai in July 2015, we reported the composition, potential role, size distribution of microorganisms in particulate matters PM, PM, and estimated their contribution to particles. The wide-range particle spectrometer suggested that the predominant particles were distributed in submicron particles (PM), which resulted in a similar community structure for bacteria and fungi in PM and PM. Among bacteria, the predominant Pseudomonas accounted for 18.06% and 21.29% in PM and PM, respectively. Alternaria covered up to 69.01% and 72.76% of the fungal community in PM and PM, respectively. A disparity between bacterial communities was identified by the abundance of rare species, such as Bacilli being higher in PM (2.4%) than in PM (1.8%), and Defluviicoccus being higher in PM (2.5%) than in PM (0.5%), which may be related to cell size and cell growth patterns. Quantitative PCR revealed that microbial cell numbers in PM were higher than in PM, and that the bacterial cell number was about an order of magnitude greater than the fungal cell number. However, the mass concentration and contribution of fungi to particulate matter was much higher than that of bacteria, suggesting the underestimated role of fungi in atmospheric aerosols. Airborne microorganisms in alpine areas remained less characterized. The findings presented here illustrated the potentially important impacts on air quality and bioaerosol pollution by biomass burning, which provides an essential reference for understanding the transmission and health effects of bioaerosols.",

Tai (36\u00b015' N, 117\u00b006' E, 1534m a.s.l) in China. Diverse bacterial population were identified and the gram-negative bacteria contributed the majority of total bacteria including Proteobacteria (81.6%) and Bacteroidetes (3.9%), followed by gram-positive bacteria Firmicutes (7.1%) and Actinobacteria (2.3%). These gram-negative taxa mainly inhabited in leaf-surface and cold environments. Meanwhile bacteria involved in the cloud condensation nuclei and ice nuclei formation were observed such as Sphingomonas (6.7%), Pseudomonas (4.1%), and Bacillus (1.1%). In addition, Sphingmonas was more active than that in daytime and participated in the cloud chemistry process. Meanwhile O and SO critically contributed to the variation of bacterial community. It is the first report on the bacterial community structure of cloud water over Asian area. Our results can serve as an important reference for environmental scientists, and biologists.",

Limitation in tracking bacterial diversity accurately has thus far prevented the knowledge of airborne bacteria and their pathogenic properties. We performed a comprehensive assessment of bacterial abundance and diverse community in PM collected at Mt. Tai, via high-throughput sequencing and real-time PCR. The samples exhibited a high microbial biodiversity and complex chemical composition. The dominating populations were gram-negative bacteria including Burkholderia, Delftia, Bradyrhizobium, and Methylobacterium. The PM mass concentration, chemical composition, bacterial concentration and community structure varied under the influence of different air-mass trajectories. The highest mass concentration of PM (61\u202f\u03bcg\u202fm) and major chemical components were recorded during periods when marine southeasterly air masses were dominant. The local terrestrial air masses from Shandong peninsula and its adjacent areas harbored highest bacterial concentration loading (602\u202fcells\u202fm) and more potential pathogens at the site. In contrast, samples influenced by the long-distance air flow from Siberia and Outer Mongolia were found to have a highest richness and diversity as an average, which was also marked by the increase of dust-associated bacteria (Brevibacillus and Staphylococcus). The primary research may serve as an important reference for the environmental microbiologist, health workers, and city planners.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  Bacteria are widely distributed in atmospheric aerosols and are indispensable components of clouds, playing an important role in the atmospheric hydrological cycle. However, limited information is available about the bacterial community structure and function, especially for the increasing air pollution in the North China Plain. Here, we present a comprehensive characterization of bacterial community composition, function, variation, and environmental influence for cloud water collected at Mt Tai from 24 July to 23 August 2014. Using Miseq 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the highly diverse bacterial community in cloud water and the predominant phyla of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, and Firmicutes were investigated. Bacteria that survive at low temperature, radiation, and poor nutrient conditions were found in cloud water, suggesting adaption to an extreme environment. The bacterial gene functions predicted from the 16S rRNA gene using the Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) suggested that the pathways related to metabolism and disease infections were significantly correlated with the predominant genera. The abundant genera  Acinetobacter ,  Stenotrophomonas ,  Pseudomonas , and  Empedobacter  originated from a wide range of habitats including cloud condensation nuclei and ice nuclei active species, opportunistic pathogens, and functional species, demonstrating the importance of ecology and health in cloud water. Cluster analysis including hierarchical cluster (Hcluster) and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) indicated a significant disparity between polluted and non-polluted samples. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) demonstrated that potential pathogens were enriched in the polluted cloud samples, whereas the diverse ecological function groups were significant in the non-polluted samples. Discrepant community structure determined by redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the major ions in cloud water and PM 2.\u20095  in the atmosphere have a negative impact on bacteria, playing a vital role in shaping microbial community structure. The major ions might provide nutrition to bacteria and directly influence the bacterial community, whereas PM 2.\u20095  in air has an indirect impact on bacterial community structure. During wet deposition, soluble particulate matter was dissolved in water droplets resulting in elevated concentration in cloud water. PM 2.\u20095  was possibly associated with different origins and pathways of air mass as determined using source tracking by the backward trajectory, mainly related to long-range transport. This work enhanced our understanding of the characteristics of bacterial ecology in the atmospheric aqueous phase, highlighting the potential influence of environmental variables on the bacterial community in cloud processes. It may provide fundamental information of the bacterial community response in cloud water under increasing pollution. However, due to the limited sample size (13\u00a0samples) collected at the summit of Mt Tai, these issues need in-depth discussion. Further studies based on an annual series of field observation experiments and laboratory simulations will continue to track these issues.",

        "abstract": "In January 2014, severe haze episodes which sweep across Chinese cities have attracted public concern and interest at home and abroad. In addition to the physicochemical properties of air pollutants, bacteria are thought to be responsible for the spread of respiratory diseases and various allergies. We attempted the bacterial characterization of submicron particles (PM, PM, and PM) under severe haze episodes using high-throughput sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR detecting system based on 21 samples collected from January to March 2014 at Ji'nan, China. The high bacterial concentration in PM (7314cells m), PM (7212cells m), and PM (6982cells m) showed significant negative correlations with SO, NO and O. Under sufficient sequencing depth, 37 phyla, 71 classes, 137 orders, 236 families, and 378 genera were classified, and the bacterial community structure varied significantly in different size fractions. For example, Holophagaceae (Acidobacteria) in PM showed 6-fold higher abundance than that in PM. Moreover, functional categories and bacterial species (Lactococcus piscium, Pseudomonas fragi, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Pseudomonas cichorii) that may potentially be responsible for infections and allergies were also discovered. Source track analysis showed that the ambient bacteria mainly originated from soils, leaf surfaces, and feces. Our results highlighted the importance of airborne microbial communities by understanding the concentration, structure, ecological and health effects, especially those in submicron particles during haze episodes.",

        "abstract": "Biomass burning (BB) in North China Plain has been urgent issue in recent years due to the severe environmental impaction. Bacteria and fungi are ubiquitous in particulate matter. Their taxonomic composition, concentration, ecophysiological functions have potentially important implications in atmospheric biochemical cycle and human health. However, current knowledge about airborne microbes during biomass burning period is scant. Here we investigated bacterial and fungal community composition, abundance and potential function in Yucheng, the center of the North China Plain during summer harvest season in 2014. Monthly field observation suggested serious pollution with high concentration of PM and water-soluble ions during biomass burning period. Elevated total bacterial and fungal concentration determined by real-time quantitative PCR was observed for samples during burning events. The predominant bacterial taxa were gram-negative, e.g. Acinetobacter, Cyanobacterium, Janthinobacterium, Massilia, Pseudomonas, accounted for 70.9% of total bacteria. The filamentous fungi Alternaria, Aspergillus, Cladosporium and Penicillium were predominant fungal genera. Metastats analysis showed significant disparity in terms of carbohydrate, amino acids metabolism, human and plant disease predicted by PICRUSt analysis between BB and non-BB events. Microbial community structure were mainly influenced by organic carbon and water-soluble ions (magnesium and potassium) suggested by redundancy analysis (RDA) and co-occurrence analysis. Our data yielded insights into microbial community dynamics following biomass burning disturbance. This study may provide potentially important reference for environmental, agricultural and health management.",

        "abstract": "Background: Recently, total ankle replacement has been widely used and the efficacy has also been recognized, but the efficacy is often assessed through various types of assessment criteria. However, there lacks the researches on the gait changes in the patients with total ankle replacement. Objective: To evaluate the walking ability of the patients before and after total ankle replacement by using Kofoed scoring system and gait analysis system. Methods: From September 2007 to June 2011, the patients received total ankle replacement were selected from Department of Orthopedics, Renji Hospital of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine and were evaluated by using Kofoed scoring system and gait analysis system. Then compared with 15 normal control subjects and observed the changes of ankle joint function before and after total ankle replacement. Results and Conclusion: After total ankle replacement, the Kofoed scoring score and most of the gait parameters were significantly improved (P < 0.05), such as the step length, gait velocity, the affected single leg supporting time and legs supporting time, as well as the activity of ipsilateral ankle joint, contralateral ankle joint, ipsilateral hip, ipsilateral knee and contralateral knee.",

        "abstract": "A well-defined amphiphilic graft copolymer consisting of a hydrophilic poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) backbone and hydrophobic poly(lactic acid) side chains was synthesized by the combination of reversible addition\u2013fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, ring open polymerization (ROP), and the grafting-from strategy. RAFT homopolymerization of an OH-containing tert-butyl 2-((4-hydroxy-butanoyloxy)methyl)acrylate (tBHBMA) monomer was first conducted to give a well-defined PtBHBMA homopolymer bearing pendant hydroxyls in every repeat unit. The pendant hydroxyls of PtBHBMA directly initiated the ROP of lactide without post-polymerization functionality transformation so as to provide a well-defined poly(tert-butyl acrylate)-g-poly(lactic acid) (PtBA-g-PLA) graft copolymer via the grafting-from strategy. The hydrophobic PtBA backbone was transformed into a hydrophilic PAA backbone to afford the target well-defined PAA-g-PLA amphiphilic graft copolymer (Mw/Mn = 1.17) containing equally-distributed carboxyls along the backbone. The PAA-g-PLA amphiphilic graft copolymer shows pH-responsive micellization behavior and it can self-assemble into non-toxic large compound micelles under certain conditions for loading methotrexate (MTX). The in vitro accumulative release characteristics of MTX-loaded micelles were investigated by UV/vis spectroscopy. In comparison with free MTX, the MTX-loaded nanoparticles display higher cytotoxicity against MG-63 in 24, 48 and 72 h.",

        "abstract": "Nephronophthisis (NPHP) is a group of autosomal recessive tubulointerstitial cystic kidney disorders. This article reports a case of NPHP type 12 caused by TTC21B mutations. The girl had an insidious onset, with moderate proteinuria, renal dysfunction, stage 2 hypertension, situs inversus, and short phalanges when she visited the hospital for the first time at the age of 3 years and 6 months. The renal lesions progressed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) before she was 4 years old. Urine protein electrophoresis showed glomerular proteinuria. There were significant increases in urinary \u03b22-microglobulin and \u03b11-microglobulin. Gene detection revealed two compound heterozygous mutations, c.1552T>C (p.C518R) and c.752T>G (p.M251R), in the TTC21B gene, which came from her father and mother respectively. The c.752T>G mutation was a novel mutation. It is concluded that besides typical tubular changes of NPHP, marked glomerular damage is also observed in patients with TTC21B gene mutations.",

        "abstract": "When subchondral bone defects are present in osteochondral lesions of the talus (OCLT), it is inconclusive whether to allow early weightbearing after microfracture treatment because of the lack of effective support of the newly-formed fibrocartilage. After performing arthroscopic debridement and microfracture treatment on OCLT patients with subchondral bone defects, we allowed patients to have an early postoperative weightbearing exercise to observe their clinical outcome. Forty-two OCLT patients with subchondral bone defects were analyzed. Patients were randomly divided into two groups with 21 patients in each group. After arthroscopic debridement and microfracture treatment, group A was allowed to have early partial weightbearing while weightbearing was delayed in group B. Visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to evaluate joint pain before and after surgery. American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score was used to evaluate joint function. Tegner activity scale was used to assess patient's exercise level. The AOFAS ankle-hindfoot score in group A increased from 54.4 to 87.6, and that in group B increased from 54.9 to 87.3. The VAS score in group A decreased from 6.5 to 2.2, and that in group B decreased from 6.4 to 2.3. The Tegner activity scale increased from 2.6 to 4.4 in group A, and that in group B increased from 2.6 to 3.9. There was significant difference in the Tegner activity scale between group A and group B (P<0.05). It was suggested that when performing microfracture treatment on OCLT patients with subchondral bone defects, early postoperative weightbearing may achieve similar clinical outcomes as delayed weightbearing, and patients may be better able to return to sports.",

        "abstract": "Surveys do! We examine the forecasting power of four alternative methods of forecasting U.S. inflation out-of-sample: time-series ARIMA models; regressions using real activity measures motivated from the Phillips curve; term structure models that include linear, non-linear, and arbitrage-free specifications; and survey-based measures. We also investigate several methods of combining forecasts. Our results show that surveys outperform the other forecasting methods and that the term structure specifications perform relatively poorly. We find little evidence that combining forecasts produces superior forecasts to survey information alone. When combining forecasts, the data consistently places the highest weights on survey information.",

The statistical evidence against UIRP is mixed and is currency- not horizon-dependent. Economically, the deviations from UIRP are less pronounced than previously documented. The evidence against the EHTS is statistically more uniform, but, economically, actual spreads and theoretical spreads (spreads constructed under the null of the EHTS) do not behave very differently, especially at long horizons. Partly because of this, the deviations from the EHTS only play a minor role in explaining deviations from UIRP at long horizons.",

This AZO thin film was deposited via RF magnetron sputtering using a ceramic target, in which the concentration of Al was about 30at%. UV/dark contrast nearly three orders of magnitude has been achieved by using it in a simply fabricated photodetector, under 254 nm UV illumination with power of 0.5 mW/cm2 and bias of 80 V. The photocurrent can be generated even without external electric field after illumination and come to saturation when the bias reaches 80 V. Conventional UV emission peak around 380 nm in photoluminescence spectra of ZnO is absent in the AZO thin film. Optical band gap of the AZO thin film is estimated to be 4.41 eV and corresponding cutoff wavelength is 281 nm. Negative surface potential of this thin film that enables high emitting efficiency is detected using Kelvin probe microscope, due to the elimination of surface barrier.\u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The IGZO films show optical transparency over 80 % both before annealing and after annealing. It was found that performances of transistors with IGZO thin films annealed in air at 450 \u00b0C were significantly improved. Through annealing treatment, Saturation current of TFTs increased from 2.8 to 181 \u03bcA at bias of VDS = 20, VGS = 20 V, and saturation mobility is up from 1.49 to 15.8 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121. In addition, X-ray photoelectric spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to provide elemental information on the surface of the IGZO films before and after annealing.

Al doped ZnO (AZO) thin film prepared on quartz substrate was chosen to be a bottom electrode owing to its high transparency and conductivity, then an InGaZnO (IGZO) thin film with high electronic mobility and ductility was grown on the substrate acting as a dielectric layer. We designed a CuO layer to be an electronic buffer layer between IGZO and top Cu electrode, which can play a critical role in increasing the On/Off current ratio. All of these four layers were prepared by RF magnetron sputtering at a low temperature of 200\u00b0C. Test results indicate that Cu/CuO/IGZO/AZO switching devices have about 102 on/off current ratio, (3.8\u223c4 V)/(\u22124\u223c\u22123.6 V) set/reset threshold voltage, and over 103 cycles anti-fatigue properties.",

X-ray diffraction results showed the obtained films had highly c-axis oriented with hexagonal (002) structures and GZO film with 20\u00a0nm buffer layer had the best crystalline quality. The resistivity in GZO/ZnO bi-layer films decreased significantly than that in GZO film without a ZnO buffer layer, and GZO film with 20\u00a0nm buffer layer showed the lowest resistivity of 4.09\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22124 \u00a0\u03a9\u00a0cm. The bi-layer films exhibited the highest transmittance of over 80% in the visible light range and displayed a low near infrared transmittance. The correlation between surface morphology and wettability was studied and GZO/ZnO bi-layer films exhibited hydrophobic property with contact angle of \u03b8 from 104\u00b0 to 108.5\u00b0, indicating acceptable property of environmental durability.",

AZO thin films and zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films, as comparison, were deposited on Cu foils by radio frequency magnetron sputtering. Subsequently, InP was grown by metal organic chemical vapor deposition with gold catalysts. InP nanowire networks formed on the AZO thin films, while no InP nanowires grew on the ZnO thin films. Morphological, crystalline, and optical properties of the InP nanowires on AZO thin films were compared with those of InP nanowires grown on silicon (Si) substrates. Zinc diffusion from AZO thin films into InP nanowire networks was suggested as the cause of substantial modifications on the optical properties of the InP nanowires on AZO thin films; redshift in photoluminescence spectra and a larger relative TO/LO intensity ratio in Raman spectra were observed, in comparison to those of the InP nanowires grown on Si substrates. In this paper, we proposed and demonstrated a new route to grow semiconductor nanowires on metals that potentially provide low-cost and mechanically flexible substrates and establish a reliable electrical contact by utilizing conductive oxide thin films as a template, which could offer a new material platform for such applications as sensors and thermoelectric devices.",

Indium phosphide nanowire networks coated with different nominal thicknesses of gold were prepared and optically studied. Scanning electron microscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy were used to study the dependence of surface morphology and phonon modes of the nanowire networks on the nominal thickness of the gold coating. The Raman peak of longitudinal optical phonon mode for as grown sample was negligible, while the peak intensity for 1 and 5\u00a0nm gold coated sample reached to 1,379 and 792 a.u. respectively. Electromagnetic enhancement and extinction coefficient are discussed to qualitatively assess the role of the gold coating on indium phosphide nanowire networks.",

ZnO:Al thin films were prepared on quartz substrates by radio frequency magnetron sputtering, then InP NWs were grown on them by plasma enhanced metal organic chemical vapor deposition with gold catalyst. Microstructure and optical properties of InP nanowires on ZnO:Al thin films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectric spectroscopy (XPS), photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopy at room temperature. SEM shows that randomly oriented and intersecting InP nanowires were grown to form a network on ZnO:Al thin films. Both wurtzite (WZ) and zincblende (ZB) structures coexist in the random orientation InP NWs on ZnO:Al thin film had been proved by XRD analysis. XPS result indicates Zn diffusion exists in the InP NWs on ZnO:Al. The photoluminescence spectra of InP nanowires with Zn diffusion present an emission at 915\u00a0nm. Zn diffusion also bring effect on Raman spectra of InP NWs, leading to more Raman-shift and larger relative intensity ratio of TO/LO.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and silencing of the S100A8 gene, which encodes the S100 calcium-binding protein A8 (S100A8), and apoptosis and phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) in tissue samples of endometrial carcinoma and HEC-1A endometrial adenocarcinoma cells in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect expression of the S100A8 protein in 74 tissue samples of endometrial cancer and 22 normal endometrial tissue samples. A stable S100A8 gene knockdown cell line was constructed using lentiviral packing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) transfected into HEC-1A cells. S100A8 mRNA and S100A8 protein levels were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. The effects of expression of the S100A8 gene by endometrial cancer cells was investigated by the MTT assay, cell cycle and apoptotic assays, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting. RESULTS IHC showed high levels of expression of S100A8 protein in endometrial carcinoma tissues, and HEC-1A adenocarcinoma cells (in G1 and G2). Increased expression of S100A8 protein was found endometrial cancer tissues compared with normal endometrial tissues (79.7% vs. 4.5%). S100A8 gene knockdown reduced cell proliferation in the HEC-1A cells compared with control cells, induced cell apoptosis, inhibited the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt), and induced the expression of pro-apoptotic genes, including the cytochrome C gene, CYCS, BAD, BAX, FOXO1, FOXO3, CASP9, and CASP3. CONCLUSIONS In endometrial carcinoma cells, down-regulation of the S100A8 gene induced cell apoptosis via inhibition of the phosphorylated or active form of protein kinase B (Akt).",

        "abstract": "Endometrial carcinoma is the most common gynaecological malignancy. The pathological factors triggering this disease are largely unknown. Although the role of GNA11 in melanoma has been described, the involvement of GNA14 in endometrial carcinoma remains to be determined. Here, we found that GNA14 expression was increased in endometrial carcinoma tissues compared with simple hyperplasia tissues. Based on lentivirus-mediated knockdown assay, we showed that GNA14 silencing significantly suppressed the proliferation of both HEC-1-A and ishikawa cells. The caspase 3/caspase 7 activity and apoptosis were enhanced by GNA14 knockdown. GNA14 depletion led to cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. In addition, Apoptosis Array analysis revealed that caspase-3 and Fas were up-regulated by GNA14 knockdown. Our study suggests that GNA14 silencing blunts endometrial carcinoma cell proliferation. Targeting GNA14 may bring help for the patients of endometrial carcinoma.",

Most obviously, the IC 50  of POM4-NP on Hela cells is 0.042\u202f\u03bcmol increased by 2.5-fold than POM4 with the IC 50  value of 0.105\u202f\u03bcmol and 38-fold than (NH 4 ) 6 [Mo 7 O 24 ] ([Mo 7 O 24 ] 6\u2212 ) with the IC 50  value of 1.618\u202f\u03bcmol, the anti-tumor activity of which has been greatly improved. POMs 1-4 NPs revealed stronger penetration and lower side effects of dose-dependent by cellular uptake compared with POMs 1-4. It proves that the POMs 1-4 and POMs 1-4 NPs have good stability for 24\u202fh by UV-vis and SEM. Further studies on its mechanism have shown that POMs can arrest cell cycle and induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. These studies will supply direction for developing NPs for intervention therapy against relevant cancers and also have implications in determining nanotoxicity.",

        "title": "A Novel Method to Enhance Dynamic Rhinoplasty Outcomes: Double \"V\" Carving for Alloplastic Grafts.",
        "abstract": "Augmentation rhinoplasty is one of the most common plastic surgery procedures performed in Asia. Most Asian patients desire not only a natural-looking nose but also a nose with natural feel. Achieving such rhinoplasty outcomes with grafts has been a challenge for surgeons due to rigidity of grafting material. We propose a novel technique to address this limitation. A total of 200 healthy adult patients aged from 18 to 25 years were randomly chosen and classified into 5 groups: A, B, C, D, and control. Each group included 40 patients. The patients assigned to conventional grafting underwent rhinoplasty with L-shaped silicone prosthesis (group A) or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE; group B), using traditional carving methods. The patients assigned to dynamic rhinoplasty underwent silicone (group C) or e-PTFE grafts (group D) using the modified double \"V\" method, which involves removing bilateral wedges from the graft to decrease rigidity. Patients in control group do not undergo the surgery. A 3-dimensional raster surface scanner was used to capture the images of the patients accurately and nasal mobility was measured. Subjective evaluations were carried out by a series of questionnaires asked to the patients. The angle \u03b1 of nasal mobility was significantly lower in conventional grafting (23.09 [5.34] mm for silicone and 17.88 [4.96] mm for e-PTFE) versus the \"V\" carving (30.53 [3.76] mm for silicone and 23.77 [4.53] mm for e-PTFE; P < .05). The double \"V\" carving method is a simple, effective, and practical method for improving dynamic nasal outcomes in patient undergoing augmentation rhinoplasty.",

A total of 11 collimated laser beams generated from outputs of fiber-coupled diode lasers formed a two-dimensional 5    \u00d7    6 orthogonal beam grids and measured at two H 2 O absorption transitions (7154.354/7154.353\u00a0cm \u22121  and 7467.769\u00a0cm \u22121 ). The measurement system was designed on a rotation platform to achieve a two-folder improvement in spatial resolution. Numerical simulation showed that the proposed two-step algebraic reconstruction technique for temperature and concentration, respectively, greatly improved the reconstruction accuracy of species concentration when compared with a traditional calculation. Experimental results demonstrated the good performances of the measurement system and the two-step reconstruction technique for applications such as flame monitoring and combustion diagnosis.",

The CoMoS 4  nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the graphite nanosheets, leading to large specific surface area and good electrical conductivity. The GN-CoMoS 4  hybrids were systematically studied for electrode materials of supercapacitors. Due to the amorphous characteristic of CoMoS 4 , which can supply more transportation channels for ion diffusion, together with the large specific surface area and excellent conductivity of GN, the as-prepared hybrid electrode material exhibited a high specific capacitance of 774\u202fF\u202fg \u22121  at the current density of 1\u202fA\u202fg \u22121  and an excellent cyclic stability (94.49% of its initial specific capacitance retained after 6000 cycles at a current density of 8\u202fA\u202fg \u22121 ). An all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated using GN-CoMoS 4  as positive electrode and porous active carbon (AC) as negative electrode, which exhibited a highest energy density of 42.85\u202fW\u202fh\u202fkg \u22121  at 900\u202fW\u202fkg \u22121  and excellent cycling stability (93.2% retention after 8000 cycles). The results demonstrate that the GN-CoMoS 4  hybrids are promising candidate for the electrode materials in high-performance supercapacitors because of the well-designed microstructure.",

Microstructure analysis showed that the CoMoO 4 /rGO hybrid composite is composed of one- dimensional CoMoO 4  nanorods grown on reduced graphene oxide nanosheets, which exhibited higher specific capacitance than pure rGO, CoMoO 4  nanorods with good rate capability. The composite retained 84.7 % of its original specific capacitance after 1000 charge\u2013discharge cycles at a current density of 1 A g -1 , which demonstrated that the long-term cycling stability of CoMoO 4 /rGO aerogel is outstanding.. Conductive graphene improves electron conductivity and enhances the Faradaic pseudo-capacitance of CoMoO 4 . The remarkable electrochemical performance makes the 3D CoMoO 4 /rGO aerogel one of the most competitive electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage, which provides a potential way to fabricate the all-solid-state and wearable energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Fluid flow maldistribution is considered as one of the main causes of performance deterioration in various energy and process systems, especially when parallel micro- or mini-channel fluidic networks are involved. For a specific purpose, the optimal flow distribution is not necessarily uniform. However, specific non-uniform distributions are somewhat more difficult to achieve than uniform ones. The insertion of a geometrically optimized baffle has been numerically confirmed as an effective solution to this issue, but experimental validation is still lacking which is indispensable for bridging the gap between theory and practice.  This paper presents a numerical and experimental investigation on the realization of target flow distribution among parallel mini-channels, using the optimized baffle insertion method. A 15-channel fluidic network integrated with the distributor and the collector is fabricated and tested. Various perforated baffles are optimized and fabricated corresponding to different target distributions (uniform, ascending and descending). PIV technique is used for the flow distribution measurement while CFD simulations are also performed for comparison. CFD results and PIV data show that different target distributions could be successfully achieved by the optimized baffle insertion method. The robustness of the optimized baffle for uniform distribution is also evaluated and discussed to provide some guidelines for future applications.",

The novel contactor having 16 Y-junctions in parallel equipped with multi-scale tree-like fluid distributor and collector was realized and experimentally tested. Oils with different physical properties and water were used as continuous phase and dispersed phase, respectively. Influences of different factors including the parallelization, the water/oil flow-rate ratio and two-phase physical properties on the two-phase flow characteristics and on the coefficient of variation were studied and discussed. Results showed that for water-pure oil flow, the novel parallel minichannel contactor is capable of producing monodisperse water-in-oil emulsions with high throughput and low energy consumption under our tested conditions. The Ohnesorge number ( Oh ) has a significant influence on the emulsion monodispersity and the capillary number ( Ca ) appears as a proper indicator for liquid-liquid break-up regimes. A predictive correlation for the  Oh  number was proposed by fitting the experimental data obtained in the study.",

        "abstract": "Fluid flow distribution among parallel channels usually plays an important role on the global performance improvement of tubular process equipment, but remains difficult to be properly measured by experimental methods. This paper presents a systematic study on the measurement of flow distribution in a multi-channel fluidic network using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique. For the precise measurement of flow-rate in each individual channel, standard 2 dimensions, 2 components PIV technique is used to obtain velocity vectors on multiple sampling planes parallel to the flow direction, so as to reconstruct accurate velocity profiles on the cross-sectional surface. Such procedure is repeated for every micro- (mini-) channel to obtain the actual flow distribution properties in the fluidic network.Pre-test results on a double-channel device indicate that the maximum possible deviation of PIV measurements is 13.1% with respect to those of a flange flowmeter, implying that the PIV technique is relatively accurate and reliable. PIV results on the flow distribution in a 15-channel fluidic network are then compared with Computational Fluid Dynamics simulation results under the same working conditions. A quite good agreement could be observed. Moreover, the locations and sizes of vortices in the distributor have a significant influence on the flow distribution. \u00a9 2016 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley u0026 Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Carbon materials have attracted much attention in many applications. Herein, high performance activated carbons (ACs) were synthesized from cheap coal raw material via a facile strategy by KOH activation. AC4T800t2 exhibited the higher BET surface area (2457 m2 g\u22121) and larger total pore volume (1.448 cm3 g\u22121) among the as-synthesized ACs samples. The optimized material (AC4T800t2) displayed a specific capacitance as high as 384 F g\u22121 at a scan rate of 5 mV s\u22121 in 6 M KOH. The capacitance remained still at 279 F g\u22121, even at a high scan rate of 200 mV s\u22121, showing good rate performance. AC4T800t2 also showed excellent cycle performance (95% retention capacity after 5000 cycles) at a current density of 5 A g\u22121. Furthermore, these ACs samples for CO2 sorption were also investigated using a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) process. The CO2 sorption behaviors of these samples were tested at 298.15 K in a pressure range of 0\u20131 MPa by the volumetric method. The Langmuir model provided good agreement with the experimental data (correlation coefficient above 0.99). The optimized material (AC4T800t2) showed a high CO2 sorption capacity of 169.44 mL g\u22121 (7.56 mmol g\u22121) at 1 MPa, also a high CO2 saturated uptake of 20.81 mmol g\u22121 (91.56 wt%). Better CO2 uptake is dependent on a larger micropore volume and higher specific surface area. In brief, the high performance AC samples have been synthesized for supercapacitors and CO2 sorption.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A homogeneous better-dispersed ultrathin nanosheets (ca. 5\u202fnm) of cobalt-nickel layered double hydroxides (LDH) supported on nickel foam scaffold was synthesized using controllable electrodeposition approach for high efficiency electrode materials of new supercapacitor. The morphology and electrochemical performances of the samples can be controlled by adjusting the precursor ratio, i.e., Ni(OAc) 2 /Co(NO 3 ) 2  molar ratio in the electrodeposition approach. With the increase of this molar ratio, the electrochemical performances give a volcano trend. When the optimized molar ratio is 0.64/0.36, the hybrid delivered a high specific capacitance of 1587.5 F g \u22121  at a current density of 0.5 A g \u22121 , with good rate capability (1155 F g \u22121  was retained even at 10 A g \u22121 ) and a robust recycle stability (remaining 91.5% after 1000 cycles at 5 A g \u22121 ). The good performance could be attributed to the enlarged interlayer spacing, ultrathin nanosheets and synergistic effects between Co(OH) 2  and Ni(OH) 2 . Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor with a high energy density of 34.5\u202fWh kg \u22121  at 425\u202fW kg \u22121  and excellent cycling stability of 85.4% after 5000 charge-discharge cycles at 2 A g \u22121  was fabricated. We believe that this fantabulous new electrode material would have encouraging applications in electrochemical energy storage and a wide readership.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Fast and low-cost fabrication of high performance electrode materials is of great importance for the application of supercapacitors. Herein, in our research, three-dimensional (3D) flower-like NiCo double hydroxide (NiCo DH) microsphere was successfully synthesized via a rapid, inexpensive and energy-saving microwave route without using any template or surfactant under atmospheric pressure. The as-obtained NiCo DH microsphere endowed with \u03b1-phase structure with CNO \u2212  ions intercalation in the interlayers (7.3\u00a0A) was composed of ultrathin nanosheets with thickness less than 10\u00a0nm. Electrochemical test revealed the NiCo DH electrode showed a high specific capacitance of 1120\u00a0F\u00a0g \u22121  at 1\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121  and remained 996\u00a0F\u00a0g \u22121  at 10\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121  (88.9% retention). Moreover, after 2000 cycles, the capacitance reached 122.5% of its initial value at 10\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121  and still retained 93.8% at 30\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121  after another 1000 cycles, showing superb stability compared with reported \u03b1-phase hydroxides. The admirable stability could be attributed to the synergistic effect between Ni and Co elements, the ion exchange phenomenon between CNO \u2212  and OH \u2212  ions in the interlayer of NiCo DH during cycling test, and the coherent 3D superstructure. Besides, the asymmetric supercapacitor, with NiCo DH as positive electrode and activated carbon from coal as negative electrode, delivered a superior energy density of 42.5\u00a0Wh\u00a0kg \u22121 . Consequently, the pleasant synthesis procedure and excellent integrated performance of NiCo DH enable it to be a promising electrode material for the energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The paper reports a microwave assisted rapid synthesis of NiCo 2 O 4 @CNTs composite for the first time. Ultrafine NiCo 2 O 4  nanoparticles approximately 6\u201310\u202fnm in size dispersed uniformly along the CNTs walls are obtained. Interestingly, nanosheets structure is formed in the absence of CNTs. The distinctive morphology difference is attributed to the different nucleating and growing mechanisms. Due to the small NiCo 2 O 4  nanoparticle size derived from microwave enabled fast synthesis and the unique 1D nanostructure, the NiCo 2 O 4 @CNTs composites materials exhibit more excellent lithium storage performance than that of counterparts.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   An OH \u2212 -slow-release strategy was established to controllably tune the (\u03b1- and \u03b2-) phase of nickel cobalt binary hydroxide in the presence of ammonium chloride. Ammonium chloride is added to the ionic solution to regulate the pH of the solution and slow down the release of OH \u2212 , effectively regulating the phase, nanostructure, interlayer spacing, surface area, thickness, and the performance of binary Ni Co hydroxide. The ion-slow-release mechanism is conducive to the formation of \u03b1-phase with larger interlayer spacing and thinner flakes rather than \u03b2-phase. Attributed to the enlarged interlayer spacing, thinner nanosheets, and more exposed active sites, the resultant \u03b1-phase hydroxides (NCNS-5.2), displayed much lower over potential of 285\u202fmV with respect to the dense-stacked \u03b2-phase hydroxides (362\u202fmV) for OER at 10\u202fmA/cm 2 . It also exhibited high specific capacitance of 1474.2 F/g, when tested at 0.5 A/g within a voltage range of 0\u20130.45\u202fV vs. Hg/HgO. This composite was also stable for water oxidation reaction and supercapacitor. The proof-of-concept of using controlled-release agent may provide suggestive insights for the material innovation and a variety of applications.",

While label-free imaging has been the prevailing strategy in Raman microscopy, recent development and applications of vibrational/Raman tags, particularly when coupled with stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy, have generated intense excitement in biomedical imaging. SRS imaging of vibrational tags has enabled researchers to study a wide range of small biomolecules with high specificity, sensitivity and multiplex capability, at a single live cell level, tissue level or even in vivo. As reviewed in this article, this platform has facilitated imaging distribution and dynamics of small molecules such as glucose, lipids, amino acids, nucleic acids, and drugs that are otherwise difficult to monitor with other means. As both the vibrational tags and Raman instrumental development progress rapidly and synergistically, we anticipate that this technique will shed light onto an even broader spectrum of biomedical problems.",

        "title": "Imaging complex protein metabolism in live organisms by stimulated Raman scattering microscopy with isotope labeling.",
        "abstract": "Protein metabolism, consisting of both synthesis and degradation, is highly complex, playing an indispensable regulatory role throughout physiological and pathological processes. Over recent decades, extensive efforts, using approaches such as autoradiography, mass spectrometry, and fluorescence microscopy, have been devoted to the study of protein metabolism. However, noninvasive and global visualization of protein metabolism has proven to be highly challenging, especially in live systems. Recently, stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy coupled with metabolic labeling of deuterated amino acids (D-AAs) was demonstrated for use in imaging newly synthesized proteins in cultured cell lines. Herein, we significantly generalize this notion to develop a comprehensive labeling and imaging platform for live visualization of complex protein metabolism, including synthesis, degradation, and pulse-chase analysis of two temporally defined populations. First, the deuterium labeling efficiency was optimized, allowing time-lapse imaging of protein synthesis dynamics within individual live cells with high spatial-temporal resolution. Second, by tracking the methyl group (CH3) distribution attributed to pre-existing proteins, this platform also enables us to map protein degradation inside live cells. Third, using two subsets of structurally and spectroscopically distinct D-AAs, we achieved two-color pulse-chase imaging, as demonstrated by observing aggregate formation of mutant hungtingtin proteins. Finally, going beyond simple cell lines, we demonstrated the imaging ability of protein synthesis in brain tissues, zebrafish, and mice in vivo. Hence, the presented labeling and imaging platform would be a valuable tool to study complex protein metabolism with high sensitivity, resolution, and biocompatibility for a broad spectrum of systems ranging from cells to model animals and possibly to humans.",

        "abstract": "Study of metabolic changes during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells is important for basic understanding and therapeutic management of cancer progression. We here used metabolic labeling and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy, a strategy of bioorthogonal chemical imaging, to directly visualize changes in anabolic metabolism during cancer EMT at a single-cell level. MCF-7 breast cancer cell is employed as a model system. Four types of metabolites (amino acids, glucose, fatty acids, and choline) are labeled with either deuterium or alkyne (C\u2261C) tag. Their intracellular incorporations into MCF-7 cells before or after EMT are visualized by SRS imaging targeted at the signature vibration frequency of C-D or C\u2261C bonds. Overall, after EMT, anabolism of amino acids, glucose, and choline is less active, reflecting slower protein and membrane synthesis in mesenchymal cells. Interestingly, we also observed less incorporation of glucose and palmitate acids into membrane lipids, but more of them into lipid droplets in mesenchymal cells. This result indicates that, although mesenchymal cells synthesize fewer membrane lipids, they are actively storing energy into lipid droplets, either through de novo lipogenesis from glucose or direct scavenging of exogenous free fatty acids. Hence, metabolic labeling coupled with SRS can be a straightforward method in imaging cancer metabolism.",

However, current technology is limited by a 'multiplexing ceiling' from existing optical materials. Here we engineered a class of polyyne-based materials for optical supermultiplexing. We achieved 20 distinct Raman frequencies, as 'Carbon rainbow', through rational engineering of conjugation length, bond-selective isotope doping and end-capping substitution of polyynes. With further probe functionalization, we demonstrated ten-color organelle imaging in individual living cells with high specificity, sensitivity and photostability. Moreover, we realized optical data storage and identification by combinatorial barcoding, yielding to our knowledge the largest number of distinct spectral barcodes to date. Therefore, these polyynes hold great promise in live-cell imaging and sorting as well as in high-throughput diagnostics and screening.",

In the present study, irNCs were derived from A375\u00a0cells by inducing the 'forced' overexpression of specific genes, including achaete\u2011scute homolog\u00a01 (Ascl1), neuronal differentiation factor 1 (Neurod1), myelin transcription factor\u00a01 (Myt1), brain protein 2 (Brn2, also termed POU3F2) and human brain\u2011derived neurotrophic factor (h\u2011BDNF). irNCs induced from A375 cells express multiple neuronal markers and fire action potentials, exhibiting properties similar to those of motor neurons. The reprogramming procedure comprised reverse transcription\u2011polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence staining; furthermore, electrophysiological profiling demonstrated the characteristics of the induced\u2011resembled neurons. The present study obtained a novel type of human irNC from human melanoma, which secreted BDNF continuously, providing a model for neuron\u2011like cells.

        "abstract": "Background:  MicroRNAs regulate adult neurogenesis. Conditional deletion of Dicer in neural stem cells (NSCs) causes postnatal death. The functional role of Dicer in adult neurogenesis remains unknown. Using mice with inducible conditional knock-down of Dicer in adult NSCs, we investigated the effect of ablation of Dicer on neurogenesis and cognitive function.   Methods and Results:  Young adult Ascl1-CreER:Dicerflox/flox mice (Dicer Cko, n= 32) were administered (i.p) with tamoxifen daily for 5 consecutive days and age matched wild-type litters (n= 30) were used as control. The mice were sacrificed at 2, 14 or 30 days after injection. Immunstaining was performed to detect phenotypes of subventricular zone (SVZ) cells. An array of cognitive tests including Morris Water Maze, odor-based novelty recognition, and sociability test were performed. Primary NPCs were isolated from the SVZ for vitro studies. Compared to control, Dicer CKo had 54% reduction of Dicer protein in NPCs. Cognitive tests showed that CKo spent 35% less time in the correct quadrant (p   Conclusion:  Our data demonstrated that inducible conditional ablation of Dicer in Ascl1 lineage NPCs impairs neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis in adult SVZ niche and white matter, and induces cognitive impairment, indicating that Dicer in adult NPCs is essential for maintaining neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis and is important for cognitive function.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:  Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with cognitive decline and dementia in the elderly. The glymphatic system mediates clearance of the interstitial solutes in the brain by exchange of cerebrospinal and interstitial fluid (CSF and ISF). We recently demonstrated that DM in aged rat induces impairment of the glymphatic system and cognitive decline. Exosomes, membrane vesicles, mediate intercellular communication by transferring their cargo into recipient cells. The present study investigated whether cerebral endothelial exosomes (CEE) ameliorate glymphatic system impairment and improve cognitive function in aged DM rats.   Methods and Results:  DM was induced in male Wistar rats (13 months, n=48) by injection of nicotinamide and streptozotocin. Two months after DM, rats were treated with CEE (1x10 11  exosomes/rat, IV) twice a week for 4 weeks. Age matched DM and non-DM rats were used as controls. CEE were harvested from the cultured cerebral endothelial cells of health young adult rats. Exchanges of CSF and ISF were measured by intracisternal injection of fluorescent tracer, Texas Red-dextran (TR, 3kD). Confocal microscopic analysis of brain slices revealed a progressive slowdown of ISF clearance in the hippocampi, assessed by retention of TR starting at 2.5 fold at 2M (13\u00b15 vs 5\u00b13% of area) and increasing to 4 fold at 4M (21\u00b14 vs 5\u00b12%) of DM. Paravascular amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) accumulation was only detected at 4M of DM. The CEE treatment significantly (p 2 ) and parenchymal fibrin deposition (9\u00b15 vs 23\u00b15/mm 2 ) compared to untreated DM rats. Moreover, the CEE treatment significantly improved hippocampal related learning and memory measured by the Morris Water Maze and odor-based novelty recognition for olfactory memory, without altering the glucose level. In vitro, cerebral endothelial cells isolated from 2M DM rats exhibited substantial dysfunction as measured by capillary-like tube formation and cell migration, whereas incubation with the CEE substantially reversed endothelial dysfunction.   Conclusions:  The CEE treatment reduces DM-induced glymphatic and cerebral endothelial dysfunctions, leading to improvement of cognitive function in aged DM rats.",

The results show that after ligin removal and enzymatic hydrolysis, the hydrolysate of black liquor contained 9.18 g L\u22121 of reducing sugar. When the hydrolysate was used for Scenedesmus obliquus (S. obliquus) cultivation, a 1.23 g L\u22121, 24.52%, and 23.20 mg L\u22121d\u22121 was obtained for growth yield, oil content, and the lipid productivity, seperately. The hemicellulose was extracted from black liquor and hydrolyzed. With addition of 3 g L\u22121 yeast extract, the growth yield of S. obliquus in hemicellulose hydrolysate increased to 2.7 g L\u22121, an increase of 26.8% than that of in glucose medium, oil content was 25.7% and the final lipid productivity reached 53.37 mg L\u22121d\u22121. The results indicate that black liquor can not be directly used by microalgae, but with approprate treatment, the carbohydrate of it could be recovered and uitilized for the oil production from microalgae.",

        "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease posing threats to multiple organs in the human body. As a typical manifestation of SLE, lupus nephritis is characterized by a series of pathological changes in glomerulus as well as accumulation of pathogenic autoreactive IgG with complement in the kidney that dramatically disrupts renal functions. Activation-induced deaminase (AID), which governs both somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class-switch recombination (CSR), has been shown to be essential for the regulation of SLE. However, the relative contributions of SHM and CSR to SLE pathology have not been determined. Based on the available AID mice, we successfully established an AID MRL/lpr mouse model, in which SHM is specifically abolished, although CSR is largely unaffected. We found that the abrogation of SHM effectively alleviated SLE-associated histopathological alterations, such as expansion of the mesangial matrix and thickening of the basement membrane of Bowman's capsule as well as infiltration of inflammatory cells. Compared with SLE mice, AID MRL/lpr mice exhibited decreased proteinuria, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine, indicating that the loss of SHM contributed to the recovery of renal functions. As a consequence, the life span of those SHM-deficient MRL/lpr mice was extended. Together, we provide direct evidence pinpointing a vital role of SHM in the control of SLE development.",

        "abstract": "Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) is an important C-type lectin and plays a critical role in the recognition of pathogens and self-antigens. It has recently been shown that DC-SIGN directly interacts with acute T lymphoblastic leukemia cells. However, the mechanism regulating DC-SIGN-dependent DC association as well as related functions is still elusive. Here we showed that DC-SIGN preferentially bound to a set of malignant T lymphocytes, including Jurkat, CCRF-HSB2 and CCRF-CEM. ICAM-2/3 on Jurkat cells appeared to be the responsible ligands and the block of ICAM-2/3 dramatically impaired DC-SIGN association. We also found that ICAM-2/3 bear a considerable amount of Lewis X, Lewis Y and Lewis A residues, which are important for DC-SIGN recognition. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed an upregulation of fucosyltransferase 4 (FUT4) in Jurkat cells and downregulating FUT4 limited DC-SIGN binding, indicating a previously unappreciated role of FUT4 in the control of Lewis antigens on malignant T lymphocytes. In addition, the presence of Jurkat cells impaired DC maturation and the block of DC-SIGN improved Jurkat cell-mediated effects on DC function and T cell differentiation. Together, we provide evidence that DC-SIGN orients DC association with acute T lymphoblastic leukemia cells and orchestrates DC functions.",

Because catalytic naphtha reforming has a complicated reaction mechanism along with multiple operation variables and objectives, its optimization is challenging. We herein report the modeling and optimization steps employed to resolve these issues. A detailed continuous catalytic regenerative (CCR) reforming process model was established, integrating the reaction kinetic model, reactor model, heater model, compressor model, and separator model. On the basis of the CCR model, multiobjective optimizations were performed, and a hierarchical structure of stochastic algorithm was proposed, thus reducing computation costs during model calculations.

In the present work, we design an economic model predictive control (EMPC) with a production mode switching strategy to cope with these problems. First, a rigorous dynamic process model is established to simulate the naphtha reforming process. Then, we formulate different economic objective functions and simplify the process model for each production mode, and also enable the EMPC controller to switch the production mode automatically according to empirical equations. Three case studies are presented to test the performance of our proposed control strategy.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) is an important refinery process by cracking heavy hydrocarbons to form lighter valuable products, including gasoline and diesel oil. However, the FCCU also generates the largest amount of CO 2  emissions among all the refinery units. To solve this problem, solvent-based carbon capture can be introduced to capture CO 2  in the flue gas from FCCU, but the energy consumption from the reboiler of the carbon capture plant will undoubtedly reduce the economic benefits of the refinery. In this paper, solvent-based carbon capture for an FCCU in a real life refinery is studied through process simulation. This study takes into account the process design and heat integration. An industrial FCCU with a feed capacity of over 1.4 million tons vacuum gas oil per year was modelled, and the process model was validated according to industrial operating data. A carbon capture plant model with MEA solvent was also developed in Aspen Plus\u00ae at pilot scale, and scaled up to match the capacity of the FCC unit. Case studies were performed to analyze the integration of the FCCU with commercial scale carbon capture plant, in which different heat integration options were discussed to reduce the energy consumption. The simulation results indicated that a proper design of heat integration will significantly reduce the energy consumption when the carbon capture plant is integrated with an industrial FCCU.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Catalytic naphtha reforming is one of the most important processes for high octane gasoline manufacture and aromatic hydrocarbons production. In this article, a modified differential evolution (DE) algorithm is proposed to optimize an actual continuous catalytic naphtha reforming (CCR) process. The optimization problem considers to minimize the energy consumption and maximize the aromatics yield. The CCR process model is established by adopting the 27-lumped kinetics reaction network, and all parameters are adjusted based on the actual process data. The DE algorithm is modified to maintain the diversity of the population. In this mechanism, individuals further from the best individual have larger possibilities to be selected in the mutation operator. The modified DE is evaluated by solving 6 benchmark functions, and the performance is compared with classic DEs. The results demonstrate that the modified DE has better global search ability and higher computation efficiency. Furthermore, the optimization results of catalytic naphtha reforming process indicate that the proposed algorithm has the ability of locating the optimal operating points, in which the aromatics yield is improved, while energy consumption is reduced. Meanwhile, the optimal operating points and results are discussed at the end of the article.",

        "abstract": "Temozolomide (TMZ) is a DNA alkylating agent, used for treating several malignancies, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with brain metastasis. PARP inhibition could potentially enhance the cytotoxicity of TMZ by hindering the base excision repair (BER) pathway. BGB-290 is a potent and selective inhibitor of PARP1 and PARP2, which is currently under clinical investigation in solid tumors. BGB-290 has significant brain penetration, making it attractive for combining with TMZ in treating brain tumors or tumors with brain metastasis. In this study, we evaluated the combination effect of BGB-290 and TMZ in cellular assays and in animal models.  The in vitro combination effect of BGB-290 and TMZ was evaluated in 7 SCLC and 8 GBM cell lines. BGB-290 demonstrated strong synergism with TMZ in most of those cells lines, lowering EC50 of TMZ by at least 5-fold in 4 out of 7 SCLC cell lines, and 7 out of 8 GBM cell lines.  The in vivo combination activity was explored in H209 SCLC xenograft model. TMZ single agent was quite effective in this model. One cycle of treatment resulted in all animals tumor-free. However, resistance occurred quickly during the second cycle. Combination of BGB-290 and TMZ significantly delayed resistance without additional toxicity. Tumors remained sensitive to the combination treatment after multiple cycles. In order to investigate whether BGB-290 could overcome the TMZ resistance, TMZ-resistant (TR) H209 tumors were generated by treating the H209 tumors with multiple cycles of TMZ in vivo. The derived H209-TR lines remained sensitive to the combination of BGB-290 and TMZ both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting BGB-290/TMZ combo might work in the TMZ-resistant settings.  Approximately 50% of SCLC patients have brain metastases at the time of postmortem examination. BGB-290 showed significant brain penetration in C57 mice. The drug exposure in brain vs. that in plasma was close to 20% after oral administration of BGB-290. Mice with established intracranial H209 xenografts were used to further investigate the combination activity of BGB-290 and TMZ on SCLC in brain. PARylation in brain/tumor tissues was well inhibited at 4 hours after single oral administration of 3 mg/kg of BGB-290. Addition of BGB-290 significantly prolonged animal survival compared to TMZ single agent in this intracranial model.  In conclusion, BGB-290 demonstrated strong synergism with TMZ in cellular assays and in SCLC subcutaneous and intracranial xenograft models. When combined with TMZ, BGB-290 can overcome the induced TMZ resistance. Its favorable brain penetration ability warrants further evaluation of BGB-290 in combination with TMZ in GBMs as well as in SCLCs with brain metastasis.

        "abstract": "Dysregulations of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling through abnormal expression or activating mutations of key signaling molecules, including RAS and RAF, have been identified in a wide range of cancers. Targeting these signaling molecules in the pathway represents a promising strategy to target dysregulated MAPK signaling. BGB-283 is a novel pan-RAF inhibitor and currently under clinical development to treat BRAF and KRAS/NRAS mutated tumors. In this study, we show that BGB-283 inhibits WT B-RAF dimer much more potently than vemurafenib at millimolar ATP concentration that is representative of the cellular ATP level, although BGB-283 and vemurafenib display similar inhibitory activity at the K m  ATP concentration. BGB-283 has very slow off-rate and the dissociation half-life (t 1/2 ) on WT B-RAF enzyme is well above 24 hrs. In comparison, vemurafenib has much faster off rates with t 1/2  in the range of minutes. The crystal structure of BGB-283/B-RAF protein complex shows the benzimidazole and trifluoro group of BGB-283 binds significantly deeper into pocket formed by \u03b1-C helix and activation loop than vemurafenib. BGB-283 exhibits time-dependent inhibition both in biochemical assay and in B-RAF or K-RAS mutated cells. BGB-283 potently inhibits the p-ERK signaling in splicing isoform p61B-RAF(V600E) cells which were reported to be resistant to vemurafenib through a dimer mechanism. In vivo, BGB-283 significantly suppressed the tumor growth in A375-p61B-RAF(V600E) melanoma xenograft model. In addition, BGB-283 inhibits vemurafenib induced p-ERK activation and selumetinib induced p-MEK feedback activation in K-RAS mutated cancer cells. In both cases, activation is reported to be mediated by RAF dimers. Taken together, we propose that BGB-283 is a novel, slow-off RAF dimer inhibitor that targets the MAPK signaling differently from the first generation BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. This feature of BGB-283 may help to address the drug resistance issues in BRAF mutated tumors and further expand its utility as mono- or combination therapy into RAS mutated patient populations.

        "title": "Abstract 4698: BET protein inhibitors prevent TKI-induced drug resistance in solid tumors",
        "abstract": "Acquired drug resistance is one of the major challenges for clinical application of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in cancer treatment. TKI-induced drug resistance could develop as a result of adaptive cell reprogramming that leads to pathway feedback activation in the same signaling pathway or parallel pathways or gatekeeper mutations abolishing drug binding. The findings of reversible drug response and lack of genetic mutations in TKI-resistant tumor cells suggest epigenetic basis during resistance development process. Targeting epigenetic modifiers and readers, in particular, the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) protein family, has shown promising efficacies against both primary and drug-resistant hematological malignancies via modulating transcription profile and suppressing the MYC oncogene. BGB-3619 is a novel, potent inhibitor of BET family proteins (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT) with IC 50  ranging from 20 to 49 nM. It demonstrates superior anti-proliferation activity than iBET762 in multiple leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. In this study, we investigated the effect of BGB-3619 and iBET762 on solid tumor cells during and after TKI-resistance development. From cell killing assays, BET inhibitors were found to be much more potent to TKI-resistant cells (vemurafenib-resistant A375, HT29, SK-MEL-5, cells and erlotinib-resistant HCC827 cells) than their parental cells. Notably, long-term colony formation assays showed that combination of low dose BET inhibitors and TKI effectively suppressed the expansion of TKI-tolerated cell populations. The enhanced sensitivity of TKI-resistant cells to BET inhibitor was due to strong G1 phase arrest rather than induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, BET inhibitors blocked cell proliferation independent of c-Myc inhibition, suggesting they might affect a broad transcription network and provide favorable epigenetic state to induce cell cycle arrest. Taken together, these findings suggested potential therapeutic activity of BET inhibitor in TKI-resistant solid tumors and a strategy of combining BET inhibitors with TKIs to overcome resistance to targeted cancer therapies.

        "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the most aggressive forms of lung cancer with a 5-year survival rate of less than 10%. Despite the initial high response rate to the frontline platinum based chemotherapy, relapse is common and rapid. The clinical activity of PARP inhibitors has shown good correlation with platinum sensitivity in breast and ovarian cancers. Thus, there is good rationale to test PARP inhibitors in SCLC. BGB-290 is a novel PARP-1/2 inhibitor, which is currently under clinical investigation in solid tumors. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo activities of BGB-290, and its combination activity with chemotherapies in patient biopsy derived SCLC xenograft models.  In the biochemical assays, BGB-290 demonstrated great potency for PARP1/2 (IC50 = 0.83 and 0.11 nM, respectively) and high selectivity over other PARP enzymes. The DNA-trapping activity of BGB-290 was measured in a fluorescence polarization (FP) binding assay. BGB-290 showed potent DNA-trapping activity with IC50 of 13 nM. In the cellular assays, BGB-290 inhibited intracellular PAR formation with an IC50 of 0.24 nM. Tumor cell lines with homologous recombination defects were profoundly sensitive to BGB-290. Oral administration of BGB-290 resulted in time-dependent and dose-dependent inhibition of PARylation in MDA-MB-436 (BRCA1 mutant) breast cancer xenograft, correlating well with the tumor drug concentrations. Compared to olaparib, BGB-290 induced PAR inhibition was more sustained. Consistent with this finding, BGB-290 demonstrated excellent anti-tumor activity in this model, over 10-fold more potent than olaparib.  In a panel of 7 SCLC cell lines tested, 3 of them were sensitive to BGB-290. SCLC primary tumor models were established in house using patient biopsy samples obtained from Beijing Cancer Hospital. The anti-tumor activities of BGB-290 as single agent or in combination with etoposide/carboplatin (E/C) were evaluated in 8 SCLC primary tumor models. BGB-290 showed weak single agent activity in these models. Six of the 8 models (75%) were sensitive to E/C treatment, consistent with the clinical response observed in these patients. Addition of BGB-290 as concomitant treatment or maintenance therapy significantly prolonged the response duration in these chemo-sensitive models. In the two chemo-insensitive models, BGB-290 and E/C combo was less effective. Addition of BGB-290 to the chemo regiment was well-tolerated throughout the study.  In conclusion, BGB-290 is a potent and selective inhibitor of PARP1/2. It is highly active both in vitro and in vivo in BRCA mutant tumors. BGB-290 has also demonstrated good combination activity with chemotherapeutics in patient biopsy derived SCLC models, supporting further investigation in the clinic.

        "abstract": "Mutation in K-RAS, which drives constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, is one of the most frequent genetic alterations in human cancers. Pharmacological targeting RAS mutants directly is extremely challenging and targeted inhibition of K-RAS downstream effector MEK has shown limited clinical activity in suppressing the progression of K-RAS mutant tumors. The reduced sensitivity of K-RAS-mutated cancer cells to MEK inhibitors (MEKi) is associated with feedback phosphorylation of MEK and rebound of phosphorylated ERK levels after prolonged treatment. A synthetic lethal screen provided the rational of targeting both RAF1 and MEK in K-RAS mutated cancers. In this study, we investigated whether combining BGB-283, a potent inhibitor to RAF dimers, and a series of MEKi could achieve better therapeutic effect of the latter. We confirmed that selumetinib (AZD6244) induced strong MEK phosphorylation in K-RAS mutated cancer cells. Either knockdown of B-RAF/C-RAF or addition of BGB-283 in the presence of selumetinib potently inhibited RAF-dependent MEK phosphorylation and led to sustained inhibition of ERK activity. Furthermore, BGB-283 and selumetinib showed synergistic effect in inhibiting proliferation of several non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines harboring RAS mutations. In vivo, combined dosing of BGB-283 and AZD6244 also exhibited enhanced antitumor activity in K-RAS mutant NSCLC and CRC xenograft models compared to monotherapies. Pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis revealed improved inhibition of ERK phosphorylation in dually treated tumors. Together, these findings suggested that combining RAF dimer inhibitor BGB-283 and MEKi could be a promising strategy in treating RAS mutated cancers.

        "abstract": "Proceedings: AACR 106th Annual Meeting 2015; April 18-22, 2015; Philadelphia, PAOncogenic B-RAF, which drives cell transformation and proliferation, has been detected in approximately 70% of human malignant melanomas and 5-15% of colorectal cancers (CRC). B-RAFV600E mutation, which gives rise to constitutive MAPK signaling, accounts for at least 90% of oncogenic B-RAF mutations. Despite the remarkable clinical activities achieved by vemurafenib and dabrafenib in treating B-RAFV600E metastatic melanoma, their clinical efficacy in B-RAFV600E CRC is far less impressive. Prior studies suggested that feedback activation of EGFR and MAPK signaling upon B-RAF inhibition contributed to the intrinsic resistance of CRC to the first generation B-RAF inhibitors. This report represents the first characterization of a dual RAF kinase/EGFR inhibitor, BGB-283, which is currently under clinical investigations. BGB-283 is a potent and selective pan-RAF and EGFR inhibitor with IC50 ranging from 5 to 47 nM on RAF and EGFR kinases. In vitro, BGB-283 potently inhibits B-RAFV600E-activated ERK phosphorylation and cell proliferation. It demonstrates selective cytotoxicity and preferentially inhibits proliferation of cancer cells harbouring B-RAFV600E and EGFR mutation/amplification. In B-RAFV600E CRC cell lines, BGB-283 effectively inhibits the reactivation of EGFR and achieved sustained inhibition of MAPK pathway. In vivo, BGB-283 is highly efficacious in inhibiting tumor growth accompanied by partial and complete tumor regressions in both BRAFV600E mutant cell derived CRC xenograft models, including HT29, Colo205, WiDr, as well as two primary human CRC xenograft models. In particular, BGB-283 shows compelling efficacy and potent inhibition of EGFR/MAPK signaling in WiDr xenograft model where EGFR reactivation occurs upon B-RAF inhibition. These findings support BGB-283 as a potent antitumor drug candidate with clinical potential for treating CRC harboring B-RAFV600E mutation.Citation Format: Zhiyu Tang, Xi Yuan, Rong Du, Shing-Hu Cheung, Guoliang Zhang, Jing Wei, Yuan Zhao, Yingcai Feng, Yi Zhang, Yunguang Du, Xiaoxia Hu, Wenfeng Gong, Yong Liu, Yajuan Gao, Rui Hao, Jiafu Ji, Lianhai Zhang, Shuangxi Li, David Sutton, Min Wei, Changyou Zhou, Lai Wang, Lusong Luo.

        "abstract": "Background: Tim-3 (T-cell immunoglobin and mucin-domian containing-3) is a \u201ccheckpoint\u201d inhibitory receptor, which is primarily expressed in activated or \u201cexhausted\u201d T cells, NK cells, macrophages and DCs. Engagement of Tim-3 receptor by its ligand phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) or galectin-9 leads to activation of negative regulatory signaling in T-cells, promoting functional exhaustion of tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes. BGB-A425 is a novel humanized IgG1 (variant) anti-Tim-3 antibody under preclinical development. The immunomodulatory activity of BGB-A425 was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo.  Materials and methods: BGB-A425 was generated through hybridoma fusion, humanized by CDR grafting and structural simulation. The Fc region (IgG1) of BGB-A425 was engineered to remove Fc gamma receptor (Fc\u03b3R) binding. The binding affinity and specificity were studied by ELISA, FACS and SPR (Biacore). The immunomodulatory functions of BGB-A425 were evaluated using primary immune cells as well as cell lines.  Results: BGB-A425 binds to the extracellular domain of human Tim-3 with high affinity (K D  = 0.36 nM) and specificity. In a competition assay, BGB-A425 efficiently blocks the interactions between Tim-3 and PtdSer. In vitro, BGB-A425 significantly enhances IFN-\u03b3 production of primary T cells and NK-mediated cytotoxicity against tumor cells. In a MLR assay, BGB-A425 augments T-cell response to allogeneic antigens either alone or in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody BGB-A317. Besides blocking Tim-3, BGB-A425 can also induce the internalization of Tim-3 receptor on cell surface. In vivo, BGB-A425 in combination with BGB-A317 inhibits tumor growth in a mouse xenograft cancer model.  Conclusions: BGB-A425 demonstrates potent activity to stimulate immune cell function both in vitro and in vivo, supporting its clinical development for the treatment of human cancers.

        "abstract": "Liver cancer has the third highest mortality rate among all cancers in China and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is often constitutively active in HCC. The growth of HCC requires the formation of new blood vessels. and VEGF is critical in this process. Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor that targets both RAF and VEGF receptor, is to date the only approved drug to treat advanced stages of HCC. Despite sorafenib extended the survival in patients with HCC, its clinical benefits remain modest and drug resistance is common. BGB283 is a second generation RAF inhibitor with unique RAF dimer and VEGFR inhibition activity. Thus, there is good rationale to test BGB-283 in HCC. In this study, we compared the in vitro and in vivo activities of BGB-283 and sorafinib in human HCC cell lines and patient derived HCC xenograft models.  In the biochemical assays, BGB-283 demonstrated great potency for BRAF-V600E, BRAF-WT, CRAF(IC50 = 32, 69 and 6.5 nM, respectively) and for VEGFR family enzymes, VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 (IC50 = 25, 14 and 58 nM, respectively). In the cellular assays, the anti-proliferative effect of BGB-283 and sorafinib was evaluated in several HCC cell lines. A head-to-head comparison of in vivo anti-tumor activities of BGB-283 and sorafinib were also evaluated in human primary HCC xenograft mouse models. The patient derived xenograft (PDX) HCC models were established in house using HCC patient surgical samples. Sorafinib was not active in 2 out of 7 models. Oral administration of BGB-283 resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition in all 7 models and was significantly more efficacious than sorafinib in 4 models and similar in the other 3 models.  In conclusion, BGB-283 is a unique RAF dimer inhibitor with VEGFR inhibition activity. BGB-283 has also demonstrated better anti-tumor activity than sorafinib in HCC PDX models, suggesting BGB-283 could be a promising drug candidate for treating HCC patients.

        "abstract": "Oncogenic B-RAF, which drives cell transformation and proliferation, has been detected in approximate 50% of human malignant melanomas and 5-15% of colorectal cancers (CRC). Despite the remarkable clinical activities achieved by vemurafenib and dabrafenib in treating B-RAFV600E metastatic melanoma, their clinical efficacy in B-RAFV600E CRC is far less impressive. Prior studies suggested that feedback activation of EGFR and MAPK signalling upon B-RAF inhibition might contribute to the relative unresponsiveness of CRC to the first generation B-RAF inhibitors. Here, we report characterization of a dual RAF kinase/EGFR inhibitor, BGB-283, which is currently under clinical investigation. In vitro , BGB-283 potently inhibits B-RAFV600E-activated ERK phosphorylation and cell proliferation. It demonstrates selective cytotoxicity and preferentially inhibits proliferation of cancer cells harbouring B-RAFV600E and EGFR mutation/amplification. In B-RAFV600E CRC cell lines, BGB-283 effectively inhibits the reactivation of EGFR and EGFR-mediated cell proliferation. In vivo , BGB-283 treatment leads to dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition accompanied by partial and complete tumor regressions in both cell-line derived and primary human colorectal tumor xenografts bearing B-RAFV600E mutation. These findings support BGB-283 as a potent antitumor drug candidate with clinical potential for treating CRC harbouring B-RAFV600E mutation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The phosphatase of regenerating liver (PRL) family, also known as protein tyrosine phosphatase 4A (PTP4A), are dual-specificity phosphatases with largely unknown cellular functions. However, accumulating evidence indicates that PRLs are oncogenic across a broad variety of human cancers. PRLs are highly expressed in advanced tumors and metastases compared to early stage cancers or matched healthy tissue, and high expression of PRLs often correlates with poor patient prognosis. Consequentially, PRLs have been considered potential therapeutic targets in cancer. Persistent efforts have been made to define their role and mechanism in cancer progression and to create specific PRL inhibitors for basic research and drug development. However, targeting PRLs with small molecules remains challenging due to the highly conserved active site of protein tyrosine phosphatases and a high degree of sequence similarity between the PRL protein families. Here, we review the current PRL inhibitors, including the strategies used for their identification, their biological efficacy, potency, and selectivity, with a special focus on how PRL structure can inform future efforts to develop specific PRL inhibitors.",

        "title": "Abstract 2364: The phosphatase PRL-3 is a pro-survival oncogene in acute lymphoblastic leukemia",
        "abstract": "PRL-3, phosphatase of regenerating liver 3, is one member of a subfamily of protein tyrosine phosphatases that belongs to the dual-specificity phosphatases (DSPs). Accumulating evidence shows that PRL-3 is a biomarker of tumor progression and metastasis and high PRL-3 expression is associated with reduced overall and disease-free survival in a variety of solid tumors, suggesting it9s importance in tumor recurrence. However, the role for PRL-3 in leukemia relapse has not yet been described.  We have found that PRL-3 contributes to Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) malignancy by acting as a pro-survival gene, both in vitro and in vivo. Expression of PRL-3 in a MYC-induced zebrafish T-cell ALL model showed that PRL-3 expressing ALL had shorter latency and higher penetrance, compared with the fish injected with rag2:Myc; rag2:GFP alone. Growth after transplantation at low cell number was also significantly faster in the PRL3 expressing T-ALL, suggesting that PRL-3 plays an important role in ALL development and progression.  We found PRL-3 to be highly expressed in a majority of human ALL compared to normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC), which suggests clinical relevance. Analysis of gene expression microarray data of 119 patient samples reveals that PRL-3 was highly expressed in 58% of the patients. In addition, PRL-3 had the highest expression in the most aggressive and treatment resistant subgroups of T-ALL, the TAL/LMO and Immature subtypes. PRL-3 is also expressed by human T-ALL cell lines using quantitative RT- PCR and immunoblotting. PRL-3 knockdown leads to significant apoptosis in T-ALL cells. The treatment of T-ALL cells using small molecule drugs including 2-cyano-2-ene-ester compound (Analog 3) and thieno [3,2-b] pyridine 1-oxide (thienopyridone) , also resulted in significant growth inhibition of T-ALL cells in part through u003e4-fold increase in apoptosis, measured by annexin V staining.  In summary, our study provides evidence for a role of PRL-3 in T- ALL malignancy, and suggests that PRL3 may be a useful drug target in the treatment of this disease. Our future studies are focused on identifying the mechanisms by which PRL3 promotes T-ALL progression and survival.

        "abstract": "In mammals, microtubule-dependent trafficking could participate the immune response, where the motor proteins are suggested to play an important role in this process, while the related study in fish was rare. In this study, dctn5, a subunit of dyactin complex for docking motor protein, was obtained by previous immune QTL screening. The full-length cDNAs of two dctn5 transcript variants were cloned and identified (named dctn5_tv1 and dctn5_tv2, respectively). Tissue distribution showed that dctn5_tv1 was widely distributed and high transcription was observed in immune tissue (skin), while dctn5_tv2 was predominantly detected in gonad and very low in other tissues. Time-course expression analysis revealed that dctn5_tv1 could be up-regulated in gill, intestine, skin, spleen, and kidney after Vibrio harveyi challenge. Moreover, recombinant Dctn5_tv1 exhibited high antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae due to binding to bacteria cells. Taken together, these data suggest Dctn5_tv1 is involved in immune response of bacterial invasion in Chinese tongue sole.",

In the present study, the aqp1aa gene of half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) was cloned and characterized. The full-length cDNA of aqp1aa is 1411 bp with a 786 bp open reading frame encoding a 261-amino acid putative protein with a characteristic structure consisting of 6 membrane-spanning \u03b1-helical domains and two highly conserved asparagine-proline-alanine motifs. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that aqp1aa mRNA is expressed predominantly in the testis of males and pseudo-males, while its expression is low in the ovary and lowest in doublesex and mab-3-related transcription factor 1(DMRT1) knock out fish and triploid males. In situ hybridization indicated that aqp1aa mRNA is expressed mainly in the germ cells of males and pseudo-males, especially in spermatozoa and spermatids. These results suggest that the aqp1aa may play a role in spermatogenesis of C. semilaevis.",

        "abstract": "\u03b2-catenin is a key signalling molecule in the canonical Wnt pathway, which plays a role in cell adhesion, embryogenesis and sex determination. However, little is known about its function in teleosts. We cloned and characterized the full-length \u03b2-catenin1 gene from half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis), which was designated CS-\u03b2-catenin1. The CS-\u03b2-catenin1 cDNA consists of 2,346 nucleotides and encodes a protein with 782 amino acids. Although CS-\u03b2-catenin1 was transcribed in the gonads of both sexes, the level was significantly higher in ovaries compared to testes. Furthermore, the mRNA level of CS-\u03b2-catenin1 was significantly upregulated at 160 days and constantly increased until 2 years of age. In situ hybridization revealed that CS-\u03b2-catenin1 mRNA was mainly localized in oocyte cells, especially in stage I, II and III oocytes. When CS-\u03b2-catenin1 expression was inhibited by injection of quercetin in the ovaries, levels of CS-Figla and CS-foxl2 mRNA were significantly down-regulated, and CS-dmrt1 was up-regulated, which suggested that CS-\u03b2-catenin1 is a potential upstream gene of CS-Figla and is involved in the development of the ovaries, i.e., folliculogenesis.",

        "abstract": "A full-length cDNA encoding phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit gamma b gene in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), termed as On-pik3r3b, was identified and characterized in this study. The sequence analysis demonstrated that the full-length cDNA of On-pik3r3b was 2018 bp, containing a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 171 bp, an open reading frame (ORF) of 1422 bp and a 3' UTR of 425 bp. Its protein sequence displayed a high degree of identity with other fish. Using qPCR, the expression patterns of On-pik3r3b were investigated. In healthy Nile tilapia, the transcripts of On-pik3r3b were detected in all examined tissues, except the skin. Upon the stimulation with Streptococcus agalactiae, the On-pik3r3b expression level in liver, spleen, kidney and gill were significantly increased at 12\u202fh after infection. The recombinant On-pik3r3b showed wide spectrum of antibacterial activity in vitro, especially against S. agalactiae. Our observation strongly indicates that On-pik3r3b is involved in the innate immune response in Nile tilapia.",

In this study, a Rac1 homolog (CsRac1) and a Rac2 homolog (CsRac2) were cloned from the Cynoglossus semilaevis. The full-length of CsRac1 and CsRac2 cDNA was 1219 bp and 1047 bp, respectively. Both CsRac1 and CsRac2 contain a 579 bp open reading frame (ORF) which encoding a 192 amino acids putative protein. The predicted molecular weight of CsRac1 and CsRac2 was 21.41\u202fkDa and 21.35\u202fkDa, and their theoretical pI was 8.50 and 7.91, respectively. Sequence analysis showed that the conserved RHO domain was detected both from amino acid of CsRac1 and CsRac2. Homologous analysis showed that CsRac1 and CsRac2 share high conservation with other counterparts from different species. The CsRac1 and CsRac2 transcript showed wide tissue distribution, in which CsRac1 and CsRac2 exhibit the highest expression level in liver and gill, respectively. The expression level of CsRac1 and CsRac2 fluctuated in the liver and gill tissues at different time points after challenged by Vibrio harveyi. Specifically, CsRac1 and CsRac2 were significantly up-regulated at 48\u202fh and 96\u202fh post injection. Moreover, the knocking down of CsRac1 and CsRac2 in cell line (TSHKC) reduced the expression of CsPAK1, CsIL1-\u03b2 and CsTNF-\u03b1. The present data suggests that CsRac1 and CsRac2 might play important roles in the innate immunity of half-smooth tongue sole.",

We present here the mitochondrial genome of Cynoglossus gracilis, which is 16,565bp in length. Numerous distinct regions were identified, including 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 tRNA genes, two rRNA genes, a light-strand replication origin, and a control region. Interestingly, we detected rearrangement of genes in C. gracilis, including a control region translocation, tRNA(Gln) gene inversion, and tRNA(Ile) gene shuffling. Additionally, a phylogenetic analysis based on the nucleotide sequences of the 13 PCGs using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods reveals that C. gracilis is closely related to Cynoglossus semilaevis. This study provides important mitogenomic data for analyzing phylogenetic relationships in the Cynoglossinae. ",

In Chinese tongue sole, stat5bl was suggested to be a candidate related to Vibrio harveyi resistance based on previous QTL screening. In this study, the full length of stat5bl cDNA was cloned and its expression patterns were analyzed. stat5bl was predominantly expressed in immune tissues, where the highest level was observed in liver, followed by skin and gill. Time course expression patterns were examined in six tissues (liver, skin, gill, kidney, intestine, spleen) after V. harveyi infection. stat5bl could be up-regulated by V. harveyi infection in all tissues except liver, despite the timepoints of peak were different. In contrast, stat5bl was significantly downregulated in liver. To elucidate the role of stat5bl in liver, in vitro RNAi were performed using primary liver cell culture. Knockdown of stat5bl could regulate the expression of genes closely related to JAK/STAT pathway. This study would enlarge our understanding of stat5bl in fish immunity.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this paper, a novel type of icosahedron AuPd \u2013 copper oxide (CuO) core shell nanoparticles (AuPd@CuO NPs) \u2013 modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) electrode for sensitive nonenzymatic glucose detection has been fabricated. AuPd@CuO core shell NPs were synthesized with icosahedron bimetallic AuPd nanocrystals as core and CuO nanoparticles (CuO NPs) as shell in a mild condition and a short time. MWCNT and AuPd@CuO NPs were characterized by field emission electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray detector (EDS) and Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR). In this sensor, icosahedron AuPd@CuO NPs showed much higher electrocatalytic activity towards glucose oxidation. At an applied potential of +0.34\u00a0V, this sensor showed a good sensitivity of 744.98\u00a0\u03bcA\u00a0mM \u22121 \u00a0cm \u22122  to glucose. In addition, a linear range of 3.00\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22125  to 9.31\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22123 \u00a0M ( R  2 \u00a0=\u00a00.997) was obtained with a detection limit of 0.10\u00a0\u03bcM ( S / N \u00a0=\u00a03). More importantly, the AuPd@CuO NPs/MWCNT modified electrode is highly resistant against poisoning by chloride ion and inference and was used to analyze glucose concentration in human serum samples. The modified electrode exhibits an enhanced electrocatalytic property, low working potential, good sensitivity, low detection limit, excellent selectivity, and good stability towards glucose oxidation, thus the AuPd@CuO NPs/MWCNT modified electrode is promising for the future development of nonenzymatic glucose sensors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A novel electrochemical sensor based on 3D reduced graphene oxide supported high-index Au NCs@CuO (RGO-Au NCs@CuO) for detection of glucose was reported in this work. A facile one-pot hydrothermal synthetic method was employed at room temperature with electrostatic self-assembly technology for the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide supported high-index Au nanocrystals. Morphology, structure and composition of RGO-Au NCs@CuO were characterized by various technologies including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Significantly, with the combination of large active surface area and high conductivity, electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of glucose was markedly enhanced. Under the best experimental conditions, the steady-state current response was linearly proportional to glucose concentration in the range from 0.1\u00a0\u03bcM to 3\u00a0mM with a low detection limit (30\u00a0nM). Meanwhile, the sensor was of excellent selectivity and stability and successfully applied to the detection of glucose in human serum.",

The biosensing properties of Au NRs-CuO nanocomposites toward glucose were studied based on electrochemical methods. Electrochemical studies indicated that the obtained Au NRs-CuO nanocomposites showed excellent electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of glucose compared with CuO NPs. The enhanced performance was related to the synergetic catalytic effect of Au NRs and CuO NPs. At an oxidation potential of +\u00a00.43\u00a0V, the current response of the Au NRs-CuO nanocomposites modified glassy carbon electrode (Au NRs-CuO/GCE) presented a good linear relation with the glucose concentration in the range of 0.01\u00a0mmol/L (mM) to 9.35\u00a0mM.

Field scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Raman were employed to characterize the morphologies and analyse the composition of the as-prepared samples. And according to electrochemical studies, MWCNT, as a carrier, showed good chemical stability and excellent electronic conductivity. Therefore, in our work, differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) demonstrated that the synthesized nanocomposites were applied to the electrochemical determination of glucose owing to its capability, such as good chemical stability and excellent electronic conductivity. The non-enzymatic glucose sensor displayed low detection limit of 0.15\u00a0\u03bcM with linear range of 0.001\u20135.6\u00a0mM in 0.20\u00a0M NaOH as the solvent, suggesting that this sensor possessed excellent accuracy and stability.

Currently, HIV contains multiple subtypes, circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms (URFs). Here, from an HIV-positive mother and her child in Tianjin, China, we identified a novel HIV-1 second-generation recombinant virus (TJ20170316 and TJ20170317) between CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC. Near full-length genomes were obtained from both samples, and they shared very close sequences, except some point mutations. Phylogenetic analyses of the near full-length genomes showed that they consist of CRF01_AE backbone and part CRF07_BC sequences. Recombinant Identification Program (RIP) and Simplot software identified four breakpoints in gag, pol, vif, tat genes in TJ20170316, totally different from other reported CRFs and URFs. The emergence of such URF in Tianjin, China, highlights the complexity of HIV-1 epidemic and more measures should be taken to prevent HIV transmissions.",

There are few cohort studies reported in China.  Methods: All data from the clinic HIV/AIDS patients in the database of Tianjin Second People\u2019s Hospital, a branch of the National Free Antiretroviral Treatment Program database, from April 1, 2010 to March 31, 2016 were retrospectively assessed and analyzed.  Results: We analyzed 2270 HIV-positive, hepatitis B virus (HBV-), hepatitis C virus (HCV-) negative patients, who received cART and followed for 13334.8 person-years. A total of 67 patients (3.0%, or 5.0 per 1000 person-years) died of non-liver-related causes. The incidence of liver-related deaths in persons without HCV or HBV co-infections was zero percent during follow-up. Only 30 cases (1.3% or 2.2 per 1000 person-years) developed hepatotoxicity, but liver function of these patients improved after changing cART regimens.  Conclusion: cART-related hepatotoxicity can be well-controlled and managed by modifying the therapeutic regimens. Liver-related mortality in HIV-positive, HBV-, HCV-negative patients is currently zero percent in Tianjin, China.",

Here we identified another novel HIV-1 recombinant virus (TJ20170315) from an HIV-1 positive man who has sex with men (MSM) in Tianjin, China. Phylogenetic analysis of the near full-length genome (NFLG) of TJ20170315 showed that it formed a monophyletic branch within the cluster of CRF01_AE reference sequences. Recombinant analysis showed that the virus kept the CRF01_AE parental backbone, and one CRF07_BC segment was inserted into gag, pol genes of the CRF01_AE backbone. Nowadays, multiple kinds of circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms (URFs) were identified among MSM in China. The emergency of URFs highlights the complexity of HIV-1 infection in Tianjin, China, and implies the next new CRF and HIV-1 epidemic are coming on the road.",

        "abstract": "C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) is the main co-receptor for HIV entry into the target CD4+ cells, and homozygous CCR5\u039432/\u039432 cells are resistant to CCR5-tropic HIV infection. However, the CCR5\u039432/\u039432 homozygous donors in populations are rare. Here we developed a simple approach to induce CCR5\u039432/\u039432 homozygotes through CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing technology. Designing a pair of single-guide RNA targeting the flank region of the CCR5\u039432 mutation locus, we applied the CRISPR-Cas9 and lentiviral packaging\u00a0system to successfully convert wild-type CCR5 into CCR5\u039432/\u039432 homozygotes in the human Jurkat CD4+ cell line and primary CD4+ cells, exactly the same as the naturally occurring CCR5\u039432/\u039432 mutation. The successful rate is up to 20% in Jurkat cells but less in primary CD4+ cells. The modified CCR5\u039432/\u039432 CD4+ cells are resistant to CCR5-tropic HIV infection. Whole-genome sequencing revealed no apparent off-target sites. This approach has the promise to promote HIV/AIDS therapy from the only cured unique Berlin patient to a routine autologous cell-based therapy.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To estimate routes of transmission among HIV-infected persons with unknown-risk histories in China. DESIGN/METHOD: All newly reported cases of HIV infection between year 1985 and 2009 were obtained from the National Databank of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). A large number of unknown-risk HIV-positive samples were found. To estimate the transmission routes HIV gag sequences were amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and phylogenetically analyzed. The cases with unknown-risk history were compared with those with known-risk histories from the same local region and time period. A statistical model was developed to predict the transmission routes and was validated on known-risk samples before testing 324 unknown-risk samples collected from 1996 to 2006. RESULTS: Newly reported cases of HIV infection in China increased steadily between 1985 and 2009 from just a handful of cases to 30340 in 2009. Injecting drug use (IDU) was the dominant route of transmission among reported cases in the early years and decreased from 83.4% in 1985-2001 to 28.2% in 2009. Conversely sexual transmission increased from 6.9% in 1985-2001 to 60.9% in 2009. Among the 324 unknown-risk HIV sequences collected from 1996 to 2006 our model identified 100 samples most likely transmitted by blood 114 by IDU and 110 by sexual transmission. Our validation samples showed that our model has 90.8% 94.8% and 69.6% sensitivity and 87.3% 87.5% and 85.5% specificity for blood IDU and sexual transmission respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a model to estimate transmission route of unknown-risk HIV-positive samples and found that these unknown-risk patients could be transmitted by blood IDU or sex.",

        "abstract": "The isolation and characterization of monoclonal broadly neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) from natural HIV-1-infected individuals play very important roles in understanding nAb responses to HIV-1 infection and designing vaccines and therapeutics. Many broadly nAbs have been isolated from individuals infected with HIV-1 clade A, B, C, etc., but, as an important recombinant virus, the identification of broadly nAbs in CRF01_AE-infected individuals remains elusive. In this study, we used antigen-specific single B-cell sorting and monoclonal antibody expression to isolate monoclonal antibodies from a CRF01_AE-infected Chinese donor (GX2016EU04), a broad neutralizer based on neutralizing activity against a cross-clade virus panel. We identified a series of HIV-1 monoclonal cross-reactive nAbs, termed F2, H6, BF8, F4, F8, BE7, and F6. F6 could neutralize 21 of 37 tested HIV-1 Env-pseudotyped viruses (57%) with a geometric mean value of 12.15\u2009\u03bcg/ml. Heavy and light chains of F6 were derived from IGHV4-34 and IGKV 2-28 germlines, complementarity determining region (CDR) 3 loops were composed of 18 and 9 amino acids, and somatic hypermutations (SHMs) were 16.14% and 11.83% divergent from their respective germline genes. F6 was a GP120-specific nAb and recognized the linear epitope. We identified for the first time a novel broadly HIV-1-neutralizing antibody, termed F6, from a CRF01_AE-infected donor, which could enrich the research of HIV-1 nAbs and provide useful insights for designing vaccine immunogens and antibody-based therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "Calorie restriction or changes in dietary composition can enhance healthy aging, but the inability of most subjects to adhere to chronic and extreme diets, as well as potentially adverse effects, limits their application. We randomized 100 generally healthy participants from the United States into two study arms and tested the effects of a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD)-low in calories, sugars, and protein but high in unsaturated fats-on markers/risk factors associated with aging and age-related diseases. We compared subjects who followed 3 months of an unrestricted diet to subjects who consumed the FMD for 5 consecutive days per month for 3 months. Three FMD cycles reduced body weight, trunk, and total body fat; lowered blood pressure; and decreased insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). No serious adverse effects were reported. After 3 months, control diet subjects were crossed over to the FMD program, resulting in a total of 71 subjects completing three FMD cycles. A post hoc analysis of subjects from both FMD arms showed that body mass index, blood pressure, fasting glucose, IGF-1, triglycerides, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and C-reactive protein were more beneficially affected in participants at risk for disease than in subjects who were not at risk. Thus, cycles of a 5-day FMD are safe, feasible, and effective in reducing markers/risk factors for aging and age-related diseases. Larger studies in patients with diagnosed diseases or selected on the basis of risk factors are warranted to confirm the effect of the FMD on disease prevention and treatment.",

        "abstract": "Dietary interventions have not been effective in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we show that periodic 3-day cycles of a fasting mimicking diet (FMD) are effective in ameliorating demyelination and symptoms in a murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. The FMD reduced clinical severity in all mice and completely reversed symptoms in 20% of animals. These improvements were associated with increased corticosterone levels and regulatory T (Treg) cell numbers and reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TH1 and TH17 cells, and antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Moreover, the FMD promoted oligodendrocyte precursor cell regeneration and remyelination in axons in both EAE and cuprizone MS models, supporting its effects on both suppression of autoimmunity and remyelination. We also report preliminary data suggesting that an FMD or a chronic ketogenic diet are safe, feasible, and potentially effective in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients (NCT01538355).",

        "abstract": "Summary  Immune-based interventions are promising strategies to achieve long-term cancer-free survival. Fasting was previously shown to differentially sensitize tumors to chemotherapy while protecting normal cells, including hematopoietic stem and immune cells, from its toxic side effects. Here, we show that the combination of chemotherapy and a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) increases the levels of bone marrow common lymphoid progenitor cells and cytotoxic CD8 +  tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), leading to a major delay in breast cancer and melanoma progression. In breast tumors, this effect is partially mediated by the downregulation of the stress-responsive enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). These data indicate that FMD cycles combined with chemotherapy can enhance T\u00a0cell-dependent targeted killing of cancer cells both by stimulating the hematopoietic system and by enhancing CD8 + -dependent tumor cytotoxicity.",

As such, studies of fasting (the complete withdrawal of food) and dietary restriction (DR, generally described as a 20- 40% reduction in calories) have contributed to the understanding of the relationship between nutrients, cellular aging, cancer development and cancer cell survival. DR may only be feasible in delaying tumor development but might not present an effective treatment modality due to the time required to achieve beneficial effects. Further, chronic DR may also have negative impacts on wound healing, which could be detrimental in patients undergoing surgery. Our findings in yeast indicated that starvation decreases age-dependent mutations whereas in mouse xenograft tumor models fasting alone can be as effective as chemotherapy drugs in delaying the progression of certain tumor types, in part through the reduction of extracellular glucose and IGF-1 concentration/signaling. Fasting, although results indicate efficacy as a treatment option, on the other hand may not be feasible for patients at risk for undernutrition or cachexia.To address the need for a dietary based intervention that both delays cancer development and progression, we developed a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) to ensure micronutrient supply and tested its effectiveness in rodent models. Periodic bi-weekly FMD cycles had a significant impact on the development and progression of multiple cancer models while allowing the preservation of lean body mass even at old age and extending longevity in healthspan study. As a treatment modality, FMD cycles alone significantly reduced tumor progression and sensitized various cancer models to chemotherapeutic drugs.Citation Format: Sebastian Brandhorst, Gerardo Navarrete, Min Wei, Todd E.

        "abstract": "Fasting reduces glucose levels and protects mice against chemotoxicity, yet drugs that promote hyperglycemia are widely used in cancer treatment. Here, we show that dexamethasone (Dexa) and rapamycin (Rapa), commonly administered to cancer patients, elevate glucose and sensitize cardiomyocytes and mice to the cancer drug doxorubicin (DXR). Such toxicity can be reversed by reducing circulating glucose levels by fasting or insulin. Furthermore, glucose injections alone reversed the fasting-dependent protection against DXR in mice, indicating that elevated glucose mediates, at least in part, the sensitizing effects of rapamycin and dexamethasone. In yeast, glucose activates protein kinase A (PKA) to accelerate aging by inhibiting transcription factors Msn2/4. Here, we show that fasting or glucose restriction (GR) regulate PKA and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to protect against DXR in part by activating the mammalian Msn2/4 ortholog early growth response protein 1 (EGR1). Increased expression of the EGR1-regulated cardioprotective peptides atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in heart tissue may also contribute to DXR resistance. Our findings suggest the existence of a glucose\u2013PKA pathway that inactivates conserved zinc finger stress-resistance transcription factors to sensitize cells to toxins conserved from yeast to mammals. Our findings also describe a toxic role for drugs widely used in cancer treatment that promote hyperglycemia and identify dietary interventions that reverse these effects.",

In mice, a 4-day fasting mimicking diet (FMD) induces a stepwise expression of Sox17 and Pdx-1, followed by Ngn3-driven generation of insulin-producing \u03b2\u00a0cells, resembling that observed during pancreatic development. FMD cycles restore insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis in both type 2 and type 1 diabetes mouse models. In human type 1 diabetes pancreatic islets, fasting conditions reduce PKA and mTOR activity and induce Sox2 and Ngn3 expression and insulin production. The effects of the FMD are reversed by IGF-1 treatment and recapitulated by PKA and mTOR inhibition. These results indicate that a FMD promotes the reprogramming of\u00a0pancreatic cells to restore insulin generation in islets from T1D patients and reverse both T1D and T2D phenotypes in mouse models.

        "title": "Brain structure and function associated with younger adults in growth hormone receptor deficient humans",
        "abstract": "Growth hormone receptor deficiency (GHRD) results in short stature, enhanced insulin sensitivity, and low circulating levels of insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Previous studies in mice and humans suggested that GHRD has protective effects against age-related diseases, including cancer and diabetes. Whereas GHRD mice show improved age-dependent cognitive performance, the effect of GHRD on human cognition remains unknown. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we compared brain structure, function, and connectivity between 13 people with GHRD and 12 unaffected relatives. We assessed differences in white matter microstructural integrity, hippocampal volume, subregional volumes, and cortical thickness and surface area of selected regions. We also evaluated brain activity at rest and during a hippocampal-dependent pattern separation task. The GHRD group had larger surface areas in several frontal and cingulate regions and showed trends toward larger dentate gyrus and CA1 regions of the hippocampus. They had lower mean diffusivity in the genu of the corpus callosum and the anterior thalamic tracts. The GHRD group showed enhanced cognitive performance and greater task-related activation in frontal, parietal, and hippocampal regions compared to controls. Furthermore, they had greater functional synchronicity of activity between the precuneus and the rest of the default mode network at rest. The results suggest that compared with controls, GHRD subjects have brain structure and function that are more consistent with those observed in younger adults reported in previous studies. Further investigation may lead to improved understanding of underlying mechanisms and could contribute to the identification of treatments for age-related cognitive deficits.   SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT   People and mice with growth hormone receptor deficiency (GHRD or Laron syndrome) are protected against age-related diseases including cancer and diabetes. However, in humans it is unknown whether cognitive function and brain structure are affected by GHRD. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we examined cognition in an Ecuadorian population with GHRD and their unaffected relatives. The GHRD group showed better memory performance than their relatives. The differences in brain structure and function we saw between the two groups were not consistent with variations typically associated with brain deficits. This study contributes to our understanding of the connection between growth genes and brain aging in humans and provides data indicating that GHR inhibition has the potential to protect against age-dependent cognitive decline.",

However, it is difficult to guarantee both security and the real-time performance at same time in deterministic industrial wireless networks. Through the analysis of industrial wireless network requirements, a novel security mechanism in chip is proposed in this paper. A hardware-based mechanism for data link sub-layer and a real-time data security process scheme are designed and implemented. Then the mechanism is verified and tested by FPGA, and is successfully implemented in an IEEE 802.15.4-based RF chip. Finally, security functional test and time overhead analysis of the sample chip have been finished. It shows that the proposed security mechanism is efficient and satisfies the real-time requirement.",

Our results showed that GO nanocolloids treatment induced autophagosome accumulation in mESCs. In addition, we found that this effect was mediated by the blockade of autophagic flux rather than autophagic induction, as evidenced by the elevated autophagic substrate SQSTM1/p62 level and LC3B turn over. Moreover, our data further revealed that GO nanocolloids disrupted autophagic flux by impairing lysosomal function, including lysosomal alkalinization and lysosome membrane permeabilization. These results indicate that GO nanocolloids can block autophagic flux in mESCs via autophagy-lysosome dysfunction. Our findings may reveal the putative mechanism of GO nanocolloids-modulated autophagy and provide experimental evidence for the importance of future safety evaluation of nanomaterials.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small and evolutionary conserved non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Differential expression levels of miRNAs can be used as potential biomarkers of disease. Previous animal studies have indicated that the expression level of miR-132 is negatively correlated with its downstream molecule nuclear receptor related 1 protein (Nurr1), which is one of the key factors for the maintenance of dopaminergic function and is particularly vulnerable in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, this correlation has not been confirmed in human patients with PD. Moreover, the possible involvement of miR-132 during the pathogenesis and progression of PD is not fully investigated. Therefore, in the present study, we determined the peripheral circulation levels of miR-132 and Nurr1 in patients with PD, neurological disease controls (NDC) and healthy controls (HC) by reverse transcription real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Our data clearly demonstrated that the plasma miR-132 level in PD was significantly higher than those in HC (178%, p < 0.05) and NDC (188%, p < 0.001). When adjusted for gender and age, higher level of miR-132 expression was associated with the significantly increased risk for PD in male, and was closely related with the disease stages and disease severity. Furthermore, peripheral Nurr1 was significantly decreased in PD compared with HC (56%, p < 0.001) and NDC (58%, p < 0.001). Much more interestingly, further analysis revealed a negatively correlation between the decreased Nurr1 level and the elevated miR-132 level in PD. All these findings indicated that the combination of high miR-132 level with its downstream low Nurr1 level might be a potential biomarker aiding in the diagnosis of PD and monitoring the disease progression.",

        "abstract": "Piperine, the major alkaloid constituent of black pepper, has been reported to possess a wide range of pharmacological effects on the central nervous system, including antidepressant, anticonvulsant and anti-ischemic activities. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential and neuroprotective mechanisms of piperine in an experimental mouse model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) induced by intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of streptozotocin (STZ). STZ was infused bilaterally at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day on day 1 and day 3. From day 8, piperine (2.5-10 mg/kg body weight) was administered intraperitoneally once daily for 15 consecutive days. The locomotor activity and cognitive performance of mice were evaluated using open field test and Morris water maze test, respectively. On day 23, all animals were sacrificed, and the hippocampus was used for biochemical, neurochemical and neuroinflammatory determinations. Our data revealed that the ICV-STZ-infused sAD mouse showed an increased oxidative-nitrosative stress, an altered neurotransmission and an elevated neuroinflammation in hippocampus, as well as significant cognitive deficits. All these alterations can be ameliorated by piperine in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, our findings predict a therapeutic potential of piperine against cognitive deficits in sAD mouse. This effect might be due to its abilities to ameliorate oxidative-nitrosative stress, restore neurotransmission and reduce neuroinflammation.",

        "title": "Double-Edged Roles of Nitric Oxide Signaling on APP Processing and Amyloid-\u03b2 Production In Vitro: Preliminary Evidence from Sodium Nitroprusside",
        "abstract": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is thought to be caused in part by the age-related accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) in the brain. Recent findings have revealed that nitric oxide (NO) modulates the processing of amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (APP) and alters A\u03b2 production; however, the previously presented data are contradictory and the underlying molecular mechanisms are still incomplete. Here, using human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with wild-type APPwt695, we found that NO, derived from NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP), bi-directionally modulates APP processing in vitro. The data from ELISA and Western blot (WB) tests indicated that SNP at lower concentrations (0.01 and 0.1\u00a0\u03bcM) inhibits BACE1 expression, thus consequently suppresses APP \u03b2-cleavage and decreases A\u03b2 production. In contrast, SNP at higher concentrations (10 and 20\u00a0\u03bcM) biases the APP processing toward the amyloidogenic pathway as evidenced by an increased BACE1 but a decreased ADAM10 expression, together with an elevated A\u03b2 secretion. This bi-directional modulating activity of SNP on APP processing was completely blocked by specific NO scavenger c-PTIO, indicating NO-dependent mechanisms. Moreover, the anti-amyloidogenic activity of SNP is sGC/cGMP/PKG-dependent as evidenced by its reversal by sGC/PKG inhibitions, whereas the amyloidogenic activity of SNP is peroxynitrite-related and can be reversed by peroxynitrite scavenger uric acid. In summary, these present findings predict a double-edged role of NO in APP processing in vitro. Low (physiological) levels of NO inhibit the amyloidogenic processing of APP, whereas extra-high (pathological) concentrations of NO favor the amyloidogenic pathway of APP processing. This preliminary study may provide further evidence to clarify the molecular roles of NO and NO-related signaling in AD and supply potential molecular targets for AD treatment.",

        "abstract": "Fabrication and assembly of electrodes and electrolytes play an important role in promoting the performance of electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices such as batteries and supercapacitors. Traditional fabrication techniques have limitations in controlling the geometry and architecture of the electrode and solid-state electrolytes, which would otherwise compromise the performance. 3D printing, a disruptive manufacturing technology, has emerged as an innovative approach to fabricating EES devices from nanoscale to macroscale, providing great opportunities to accurately control device geometry (e.g., dimension, porosity, and morphology) and structure with enhanced specific energy and power densities. Moreover, the \u201cadditive\u201d manufacturing nature of 3D printing provides excellent controllability of the electrode thickness with much simplified process in a cost effective manner. With the unique spatial and temporal material manipulation capability, 3D printing can integrate multiple nano-materials in the same print, and multi-functional EES devices (including functional gradient devices) can be fabricated. Herein, we review recent advances in 3D printing of EES devices. We focus on two major 3D printing technologies including direct writing and inkjet printing. The direct material deposition characteristics of these two processes enable them to print on a variety of flat substrates, even a conformal one, well suiting them to applications such as wearable devices and on-chip integrations. Other potential 3D printing techniques such as freeze nano-printing, stereolithography, fused deposition modeling, binder jetting, laminated object manufacturing, and metal 3D printing are also introduced. The advantages and limitations of each 3D printing technology are extensively discussed. More importantly, we provide a perspective on how to integrate the emerging 3D printing with existing technologies to create structures over multiple length scale from nano to macro for EES applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Among different printing techniques, direct ink writing is commonly used to fabricate 3D battery and supercapacitor electrodes. The major advantages of using the direct ink writing include effectively building 3D structure for energy storage devices and providing higher power density and higher energy density than traditional techniques due to the increased surface area of electrode. Nevertheless, direct ink writing has high standards for the printing inks, which requires high viscosity, high yield stress under shear and compression, and well-controlled viscoelasticity. Recently, a number of 3D-printed energy storage devices have been reported, and it is very important to understand the printing process and the ink preparation process for further material design and technology development. We discussed current progress of direct ink writing technologies by using various electrode materials including carbon nanotube-based material, graphene-based material, LTO (Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 ), LFP (LiFePO 4 ), LiMn 1-x Fe x PO 4 , and Zn-based metallic oxide. Based on achieve electrochemical performance, these 3D-printed devices deliver performance comparable to the energy storage device fabricated using traditional methods still leaving large room for further improvement. Finally, perspectives are provided on the potential future direction of 3D printing for all solid-state electrochemical energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Current supercapacitors suffer from low energy density mainly due to the high degree of microporosity and insufficient hydrophilicity of their carbon electrodes. Development of a supercapacitor capable of simultaneously storing as much energy as a battery, along with providing sufficient power and long cycle stability would be valued for energy storage applications and innovations. Differing from commonly studied reduced graphene oxides, in this work we identified an inexpensive heteroatom polymer (polyaniline-PANI) as a carbon/nitrogen precursor, and applied a controlled thermal treatment at elevated temperature to convert PANI into 3D high-surface-area graphene-sheet-like carbon materials. During the carbonization process, various transition metals including Fe, Co, and Ni were added, which play critical roles in both catalyzing the graphitization and serving as pore forming agents. Factors including post-treatments, heating temperatures, and types of metal were found crucial for achieving enhanced capacitance performance on resulting carbon materials. Using FeCl as precursor along with optimal heating temperature 1000 \u00b0C and mixed acid treatment (HCl+HNO), the highest Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 1645 mg was achieved on the mesopore dominant graphene-sheet-like carbon materials. The unique morphologies featured with high-surface areas, dominant mesopores, proper nitrogen doping, and 3D graphene-like structures correspond to remarkably enhanced electrochemical specific capacitance up to 478 Fg in 1.0 M KOH at a scan rate of 5 mV s. Furthermore, in a real two-electrode system of a symmetric supercapacitor, a specific capacitance of 235 Fg using Nafion binder is obtained under a current density of 1 Ag by galvanostatic charge-discharge tests in 6.0 M KOH. Long-term cycle stability up to 5000 cycles by using PVDF binder in electrode was systematically evaluated as a function of types of metals and current densities.",

CTA films doped with 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([emim][BF 4 ]) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide ([emim][dca]) were prepared; and the effect of IL loading on properties of the CTA, such as crystallinity, density, degradation temperature, glass transition temperature, and gas transport properties, were determined. The IL doping reduces the glass transition temperature and degree of crystallinity of CTA, increasing gas diffusivity and permeability. The IL doping also increases CO 2 /CH 4  solubility selectivity and CO 2 /N 2  permeability selectivity, due to the affinity of these ILs with CO 2 , compared to light gases such as CH 4  and N 2 . This study demonstrates a promising route in manipulating the morphology and gas transport properties of semi-crystalline polymers by doping with ILs.",

For multi-level inverter, it is very difficult to realize the SVB-PWM because its vector space is very complex. In this paper, a unified TCB-PWM strategy for three-phase N-level diode clamped inverter, including continuous PWM (CPWM) and discontinuous PWM (DPWM), is proposed. With the proposed strategy, the final modulation signals can be easily obtained by twice common mode voltage (CMV) injections. The PWM driver signals are generated by comparing the final modulation signals and phase deposition triangle carriers. Especially, the procedures to realize different types of PWM method are demonstrated in this paper. The proposed method can be directly implemented in digital processers.",

The function equivalent relationship of the proposed TCB-DPWM and space vector-based DPWM (SVB-DPWM) is mathematically analyzed in this paper. The proposed TCB-DPWM method effectively simplified the implementation of the SVB-DPWM by injecting twice common mode voltages (CMVs) to original modulation signals, where different DPWM methods can be easily obtained in a unified scheme by setting different values of the proportional allocation factor for small vectors in different sectors. In addition, a TCB-DPWM-based neutral-point voltage balancing method is investigated to demonstrate its application. The polarity of the CMV injection is regulated according to the polarity of the proportional allocation factor to realize the neutral-point voltage balancing. Finally, the proposed TCB-DPWM and the neutral-point voltage balancing method are both verified by simulation and experimental results. The results show that the proposed TCB-DPWM can effectively simplify the implementation of modulation and improve system efficiency.",

Firstly, the CMV of the 3LT 2 Is is analyzed and only six medium and one zero voltage vectors (6MV1Z) which generate zero CMV are defined as the candidate voltage vectors (VVs) for the FCS-MPC. Furthermore, the dead time effects when utilizing the defined candidate VVs with 6MV1Z are investigated and a new FCS-MPC based CMV elimination (CMV-EL) method is proposed. In the proposed CMV-EL method, the candidate voltage VVs are redefined by pre-excluding the VVs which will cause CMV fluctuations during the dead time from 6MV1Z. Besides, the proposed CMV-EL method can effectively eliminate the CMV as well as control the grid current and balance the neutral point potentials (NPPs). Finally, experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed CMV-EL method.",

To explore the relationship between geographical location of heavy metal content in Ch. indicum and the content of heavy metal elements in soil. The results showed that the Ch. indicum had high enrichment of Cd and had a synergistic effect on the absorption of five heavy metal elements. Elevation directly affected the accumulation of Pb and Cd in Ch. indicum and was a positive effect. The direct positive effect of latitude acts on the accumulation of Hg and Cu in Ch. indicum. The effect of longitude on the Cd content was the negative effect of longitude. The geographical location had different effects on the accumulation of heavy metal elements in Ch. indicum. There was a certain interaction between direct and indirect effects. Ch. indicum had different absorption and enrichment characteristics for different heavy metal species. When controlling the heavy metal content and medicinal material quality of Ch. indicum, we must fully consider the influence of geographical location on the quality of medicinal materials, select suitable geographic regions to carry out acquisitions, and choose a good ecological environment.

The content of Cd in different parts of Ch. indicum and the content of buddleoside and the total flavonoids in Ch. indicum were determined. The absorption characteristics of Cd elements in Ch. indicum were analyzed. And the influence of Cd elements on the quality of the herbs. The results showed that the application of soil Cd in the range of 0-100 mg\u00b7kg~(-1) had no significant effect on the biomass of Ch. indicum,and the root-shoot ratio showed a decreasing-increasing-decreasing trend. The content of Cd in different parts of Ch. indicum was significantly different,and the content of aboveground part was higher than that of underground part. The enrichment factors of Cd elements in different parts of Ch. indicum are different. The enrichment coefficient of aboveground parts is larger than that of underground parts. The whole parts and plants show an increase first and then decrease,and the overall enrichment factor is greater than1. The transfer coefficient of the aerial part/underground part of Ch. indicum showed a decreasing-increasing-decreasing-increasing trend with the increase of the amount of Cd applied in the soil,and the transfer coefficient was higher than 1. The contents of buddleoside and total flavonoids in Ch. indicum after Cd stress treatment were lower than the control,and the overall performance was lower and then increased,but it was still significantly lower than the control,indicating that Cd pollution directly led to the decrease of chemical quality of Ch. indicum.",

        "abstract": "The forecast skill of BCC-CSM1.1 model in summer East Asian climate was evaluated with the decadal prediction experiments launched annually during 1961\u20132005. Results of the decadal prediction were compared with those of the historical simulation to estimate contribution of the initialization. Improved prediction skill is found for summer surface air temperature (SAT) in central eastern China measured by both root mean square error (RMSE) and anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) for the forecast years 2\u20135. The decadal hindcast of precipitation in central eastern China shows increased skill in RMSE but not ACC. Such improvement in East Asia is related to enhanced prediction skill of the western Pacific (WP) sea surface temperature (SST) originated from the oceanic initialization. In the decadal hindcast, the lower tropospheric atmospheric circulation associated with warm WP exhibits an anticyclone over the South China Sea, which resembles the observation. The southwesterly increases over southeast China associated with warm WP, favouring higher SAT in central eastern China. This reveals that the decadal predictions could more realistically reproduce the relationship between summer East Asian atmospheric circulation and WP SST. The 4-year average forecast within a decade shows that the initialization increases the ACC skill up to forecast years 4\u20137 for summer SAT in central eastern China.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Decadal prediction experiments of Beijing Climate Center climate system model version 1.1 (BCC-CSM1.1) participated in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) had poor skill in extratropics of the North Atlantic, the initialization of which was done by relaxing modeled ocean temperature to the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) reanalysis data. This study aims to improve the prediction skill of this model by using the assimilation technique in the initialization. New ocean data are firstly generated by assimilating the sea surface temperature (SST) of the Hadley Centre Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature (HadISST) dataset to the ocean model of BCC-CSM1.1 via Ensemble Optimum Interpolation (EnOI). Then a suite of decadal re-forecasts launched annually over the period 1961\u20132005 is carried out with simulated ocean temperature restored to the assimilated ocean data. Comparisons between the re-forecasts and previous CMIP5 forecasts show that the re-forecasts are more skillful in mid-to-high latitude SST of the North Atlantic. Improved prediction skill is also found for the Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation (AMO), which is consistent with the better skill of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) predicted by the re-forecasts. We conclude that the EnOI assimilation generates better ocean data than the SODA reanalysis for initializing decadal climate prediction of BCC-CSM1.1 model.",

As compared with the observations and historical experiments, the contribution of initialization for climate model to predict the seasonal scale AO and its interannual variations is estimated. Results show that the spatial correlation coefficient of AO mode simulated by the decadal experiment is higher than that in the historical experiment. The two groups of experiments reasonably reproduce the characteristics that AO indices are the strongest in winter and the weakest in summer. Compared with historical experiments, the correlation coefficient of the monthly and winter AO indices are higher in the decadal experiments. In particular, the correlation coefficient of monthly AO index between decadal hindcast and observation reached 0.1 significant level. Furthermore, the periodicity of the monthly and spring AO indices are achieved only in the decadal experiments. Therefore, the initial state of model is initialized by using sea temperature data may help to improve the prediction skill of AO in the decadal prediction experiments to some extent.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Spray jet in cold kerosene-fueled supersonic flow has been characterized under different injection pressures to assess the effects of the pressure variation on the mixing between incident shock wave and transverse cavity injection. Based on the real scramjet combustor, a detailed computational fluid dynamics model is developed. The injection pressures are specified as 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0\u00a0MPa, respectively, with the other constant operation parameters (such as the injection diameter, angle and velocity). A three dimensional Couple Level Set u0026 Volume of Fluids approach incorporating an improved Kelvin-Helmholtz u0026 Rayleigh-Taylor model is used to investigate the interaction between kerosene and supersonic air. The numerical simulations primarily concentrate on penetration depth, span expansion area, angle of shock wave and sauter mean diameter distribution of the kerosene droplets with/without evaporation. Validation has been implemented by comparing the calculated against the measured in literature with good qualitative agreement. Results show that the penetration depth, span-wise angle and expansion area of the transverse cavity jet are all increased with the injection pressure. However, when the injection pressure is further increased, the value in either penetration depth or expansion area increases appreciably. This study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the combination of Couple Level Set u0026 Volume of Fluids approach and an improved Kelvin-Helmholtz u0026 Rayleigh-Taylor model, in turn providing insights into scramjet design improvement.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Effective fuel injection and mixing is of particular importance for scramjet engines to be operated reliably because the fuel must be injected into high-speed crossflow and mixed with the supersonic air at an extremely short time-scale. This study numerically characterizes an injection jet under different spray angles in a cold kerosene-fueled supersonic flow and thus assesses the effects of the spray angle on the mixing between incident shock wave and transverse cavity injection. A detailed computational fluid dynamics model is developed in accordance with the real scramjet combustor. Next, the spray angles are designated as 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, and 135\u00b0 respectively with the other constant operational conditions (such as the injection diameter, velocity and pressure). Next, a combination of a three dimensional Couple Level Set u0026 Volume of Fluids with an improved Kelvin-Helmholtz u0026 Rayleigh-Taylor model is used to investigate the interaction between kerosene and supersonic air. The numerical predictions are focused on penetration depth, span expansion area, angle of shock wave and sauter mean diameter distribution of the kerosene droplets with or without evaporation. Finally, validation has been implemented by comparing the calculated to the measured in literature with good qualitative agreement. Results show that no matter whether the evaporation is considered, the penetration depth, span-wise angle and expansion area of the kerosene droplets are all increased with the spray angle, and most especially, that the size of the kerosene droplets is surely reduced with the spray angle increase. These calculations are beneficial to better understand the underlying atomization mechanism in the cold kerosene-fueled supersonic flow and hence provide insights into scramjet design improvement.",

Atmospheric duct is an anomalous phenomenon of electromagnetic waves in the atmosphere that affects the use of radio equipment, obtaining real-time atmospheric duct information is of great significance for ship communication, navigation and radar detection. In order to achieve a real-time inversion system, a multilayer perceptron (MLP), a quintessential deep learning model is chosen as the inversion method. After trial-and-error, a five-hidden-layer MLP with rectified linear unit activation function is chosen. Since refractivity inversion is a regression problem, the mean-squared error is utilized to construct the loss function, and the adaptive moment estimation (Adam) algorithm is chosen to accelerate the training convergence. A pregenerated database is used to train the MLP, and thus invert the refractivity profile. The results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of this MLP-based inversion method.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTAtmospheric duct propagation has a significant influence on the performance of wireless communication and radar systems in the maritime environment that makes it essential to master the detailed knowledge of the atmospheric refractivity profile. Automatic identification system (AIS) is a maritime navigation safety communication system that operates in the very high frequency mobile band and the propagation path of AIS signals will be influenced by different atmospheric conditions. In this paper, a new refractivity estimation method based on the AIS signal level is proposed and the Levy flight quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (LFQPSO) algorithm is presented and applied in the new estimation method to estimate the surface based duct parameters. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the LFQPSO algorithmhas good robustness and the new refractivity estimation method based on the AIS signal level can provide near-real-time estimation ofatmospheric refractivity.",
