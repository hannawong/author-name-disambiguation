By this method, the dimension of data is reduced greatly, the complexity in the process of SVM classification is decreased highly, the occupied memory is cut down and the over-fit of training model is prevented at some extent, also the good classification performance is obtained. Finally, the simulation experiment of radar signal recognition and its results show this hybrid method is effective.",

The air flow field model of the dual slot die is established and solved numerically using the finite volume method and SIMPLE algorithm. The air temperature is measured with a temperature measuring system built for this research. Experimental results show that the simulation results of the air temperature coincide with the measured data which indicates the air flow flied model is effective.

Therefore, the fiber diameter is strongly affected by the air flow field. Dual slot die is one of the widely used melt blowing dies. Hot air emits from the two slots symmetrically. What will happen to the polymer drawing if the air jets are unsymmetrical? In this paper, the unsymmetrical air flow field of the dual slot die in melt blowing process is simulated numerically. The distributions of air velocity and air temperature are obtained. The polymer drawing model is then solved with the aid of the simulation results of air velocity and air temperature. The diameter and transverse displacement of the threadline along the spinline is achieved. The result shows that the threadline diameter of unsymmetrical air flow field is larger than that of the symmetrical air flow field and the threadline tends to deflect because of the unsymmetrical air jets. This paper helps to indicate the research direction for further decreasing the fiber diameter of melt blown nonwoven fabrics. \u00a9 (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",

        "abstract": "The relationship between yarn properties, fabric parameters, and shear stiffness of worsted fabrics is modeled using the soft computing technique. Because of the small number of samples, the artificial neural network model to be established must be a small-scale one. Therefore, this soft computing approach includes two stages. First, the yarn properties and fabric parameters are selected by utilizing an input variable selection method, so as to find the most relevant yarn properties and fabric parameters as the input variables to fit the small-scale artificial neural network model. The first part of this method takes the human knowledge on the shear stiffness of fabrics into account. The second part utilizes a data sensitivity criterion based on a distance method. Second, the artificial neural network model of the relationship between yarn properties, fabric parameters, and shear stiffness of fabrics is established. The results show that the artificial neural network model yields accurate prediction and a reasonably good artificial neural network model can be achieved with relatively few data points by integrating with the input variable selecting method developed in this research. The results also show that there is great potential for this research in the field of computer-assisted design in textile technology. Copyright \u00a9 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Efforts have been made to introducing novel natural fibers, micro fibers and differential fibers into spunlaced nonwoven production, while spunlacing technology is adopted in the process for making nonwoven composites. This has enlarged the product range and opened wider application field for spunlaced nonwovens beyond the traditional medical and artificial leather applications. The method for making nonwoven composites based on spunlacing technology is described in this paper: layers formed by different web forming methods are bonded together by spunlacing technology. The properties of the resultant nonwoven composites are also introduced, which show the potential of spunlacing technology.",

        "abstract": "Melt blowing process can produce superfine fibers. In this process, the polymer is drawn by the high velocity hot air jets from the dual slot die. The die parameters have great effects on the fiber diameter. In this paper, the die parameters of the dual slot die in an industrial melt blowing equipment are studied using the orthogonal experimental design method. Three parameters namely the inset distance, slot width and slot angle are considered. Each parameter has three levels. Nine sizes of dual slot dies with different design parameters are numerically simulated using the established air flow field model of melt blowing process. Distributions of air velocity and air temperature of nine air jet flow fields are obtained. Effects of the three parameters are studied with range analysis and variance analysis. The results show that the inset distance and slot width have significant effects on the air flow field while effect of the slot angle is unremarkable. Finally the optimal die parameters are obtained. The results lay the theoretical foundation for further studies on the computer assisted design for the dual slot die in the melt blowing process. \u00a9 (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",

Methods:Bile samples were enzymatic hydrolyzed before analysis by RP-HPLC. SB-C_(18) HPLC column (250 mm\u00d74.6mm, 5\u03bcm)was used. The mobile phase was methanol-0.2% phosphoric acid (52:48,v/v) with the flow rate of 1.0mL\u00b7min~(-1); the UV detector was set at 350 nm. Results:A good separation was obtained. The standard curves for luteolin and apigenin in bile were linear over the range of 0.1745-6.986\u03bcg\u00b7mL~(-1) and 0.3693-11.08\u03bcg\u00b7mL~(-1), respectively. The absolute recovery for luteolin and apigenin was 84.6% to 106.2% and assay recovery was 80.1% to 106.9%. The intra -and inter -day precisions (RSD) for luteolin and apigenin were all less than 14%. The relative biliary excretion rate of intake dose Of luteolin and apigenin during 36 hours after oral administration were 2.05% and 6.34%, respectively. Conclusion:The method developed is accurate, sensitive for the determination of luteolin and apigenin in bile. Enterohepatic circulation of luteolin and apigenin associated with double peaks in the blood concentration-time curves can be proved by the biliary excretion.",

After centrifugation, 4.0 ml of supernatant was separated and vaporized to dryness, and the residue was reconstituted in mobile phase for HPLC analysis. The HPLC analysis was performed on an SB C18 column using acetonitrile and water (65:35, v/v) as mobile phase with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min with UV detection at 220 nm.The calibration curves for BFTS and BFDS in sample were linear over the concentration ranges of 0.04712-14.78 microg/g(r=0.999) and 0.04831-23.96 microg/g(r=0.999), respectively. The limits of quantification were 0.04712 microg/g and 0.04831 microg/g for BFTS and BFDS, respectively. The assay recoveries for BFTS and BFDS ranged from 95.71%-107.2% and 90.00%-110.5%, respectively. The precisions were obtained with RSD of <10%. The developed method was successfully applied to study the content of BFTS and BFDS in the lungs of rats after intravenous injection of 12.5 mg/kg BFTS.The method developed is simple, selective, repeatable and accurate, which can be applied to study the tissue distribution of BFTS and BFDS.",

METHODS: The concentrations of luteolin and apigenin in plasma were determined by HPLC method after a single oral dose of 200 mg\u00b7kg -1 of intact CME and hydrolysate of CME was administered to rabbits. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by software 3P87 and statistical analysis was performed by software Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: The plasma concentration of luteolin was determined accurately and the pharmacokinetic profile was discribed by an one-compartment model. However, the present study showed that the concentration of apigenin was too low to be measured accurately. There were some differences in pharmacokinetic parameters for active component (luteolin) between the hydrolysate of CME and intact CME apparently. Furthermore, the oral hydrolysate of CME resulted in a delayed t max, lower \u03c1 max and longer MRT (mean residence time) for luteolin than those after an oral dose of intact CME. CONCLUSION: By statistical analysis, the bioavailability of luteolin reveals no significant difference (P > 0.05) after an oral administration of acid hydrolysate of CME or intact CME to rabbit.",

Methods Orthogonal experiment was designed to optimize the formulation of rutin submicron emulsion. The content and entrapment efficiency of the preparation were determined by HPLC, and its properties such as particle size, zeta potential and hemolysis were studied. Results The optimized formulation was composed of rutin 2 g\u00b7L-1, oil phase 100 g\u00b7L-1 with MCT-LCT (m:m=1:1), SPC 18 g\u00b7L-1 , Poloxamer F-68 8 g\u00b7L-1 , sodium oleate 5 g\u00b7L-1, vitamin E 4 g\u00b7L-1, and glycerin 22.5 g\u00b7L-1. Homogenizing the sample for 6 times at 100 MPa at room temperature was optimal. Both drug content and mean entrapment efficiency of rutin submicron emulsions were above 90.0 % , with the pH value between 5 and 6, mean particle size of 143 nm, and \u03b6 potential of -27.4 mV Conclusion By using this optimized formulation and preparation technique, stable rutin submicron emulsion can be obtained without hemolysis.",

Methods Totally 1,188 elderly people were investigated by questionnaire. The exercise situation and its influencing factors were analyzed. Results The proportion of elderly people in sports population was 58.7%, and 47.3% actively taking part in exercise. Major sports event in the elderly was walk, accounting for 67.8%, Jogging, health exercises, fast walking and dancing accounted for 14.4%, 13.1%, 13.6% and 12.9% respectively. The motivation of participating in physical exercise of the elderly was mainly for exercise and diseases prevention, accounting for 90.0% and 43.6% respectively. The main reasons of the non-participating were no interest in sports and no time, accounting for 46.0% and 43.9%, while having no playground only account for 3.6%. The significant factors influencing exercise participation were profession, whether living with their children, whether working, time in doing daily housework, and satisfaction degree of their economic situation. Conclusion The level of exercise of the elderly in Baoshan District is growing. Physical exercise of the elderly should be organized and promoted in terms of communities, families and others.",

Results More than 91.8% counseling spots reached the standards. The area of 64.5% counseling spot is about ten to twenty square meters. There were about ten persons to seek counseling health every time in 68.2% counseling spots. 70.0% residents and 79.1% respondents thought that the counseling is important. However, only 39.7% consultants thought that residents paid more attention to consultation. Residents hoped to receive health service and respondents hoped to receive disease prevention and control guidance. Consultants wanted to be trained on health behavior, mental health care, chronic disease prevention and control. In face of difficulties, doctors were lack of time and health promotion volunteers were lack of techniques. Consultants suggested improving counseling condition, increasing free materials and organizing well, while respondents suggested increasing free materials, improving counseling condition and advancing counsel level.

Methods There were 4 questionnaires were composed based on 66 items of healthcare knowledge as people should know necessarily, and assigned among community residents. Analysis was conducted on the difference of knowledge rates of varied question types, and to figure out whether question type itself would cause vast variation of the results. Results There were significant differences in all 5 groups of different types of questions with the same content (P<0.01). Among the accuracy rates, the truth-descriptive True/False (T/F) questions took the first place, best-choice questions the second and false-descriptive T/F questions the worst. No significant difference was found among the six of seven study groups of true-descriptive T/F questions with the same content and question type, no significant difference as well in the three of five false-descriptive ones (P>0.05). Conclusion The results of evaluation differed largely among different question types. Because of the better performance in reflecting the actual knowledge, the choice question and the false-descriptive T/F question could be used more widely in a scientific way.",

Methods 5 635 people of 15 to 69 years old were investigated on their smoking and quitting status and related factors in Baoshan District by using behavioral risk factor monitoring method. Results The smoking rate in Baoshan male residents accounts for 54.4%, with no significant change in the latest 5 years(P>0.05). While the successful quitting rate takes up 7.9%. The participants of different age, occupation, or hypertension also have significant disparity with other groups(P<0.01). Smokers either older than 60, or nearly the age of retirement, or with hypertension present better quitting rate than their counterparts; Besides, adequate knowledge and attitude to the adversity of tobacco also contribute to a higher rate of successful smoking quitting(P<0.01). According to multivariate analysis, the initial incentives of successful smoking quitting are age, accompanying ailment and the awareness of smoking harmful results. Conclusion The prevalence of smoking in Baoshan District remained the same across time, with a relatively low rate of smoking quitting. These findings have implications for clinical and public health interventions to educate the residents, so as to reduce and prevent smoking.",

        "abstract": "The roles of specific active ingredients in Chinese medicinal formulas have not been clearly elucidated. In this study, we selectively deleted and replenished paeoniflorin from Si-Ni-San, a traditional Chinese prescription, and aimed to identify the molecular basis of how paeoniflorin exerted its effect in Si-Ni-San.Contact dermatitis was induced in mice with picryl chloride. Paeoniflorin was selectively deleted from Si-Ni-San by an immunoaffinity column. Quantitative real-time PCR, western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used in this study.Both Si-Ni-San and paeoniflorin significantly reduced ear swelling in mice while the paeoniflorin-deleted Si-Ni-San (Si-Ni-San(PF-)) showed little ameliorative effect. In lipopolysaccharide-evoked macrophages, Si-Ni-San and paeoniflorin markedly inhibited tumor necrosis factor-alpha production, cyclooxygenase-2 activity, as well as extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation while Si-Ni-San(PF-) exhibited no or slight inhibitory effect. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect on the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha reappeared when different proportions of paeoniflorin were replenished in Si-Ni-San(PF-). In addition, the expression of macrophage migration inhibitory factor in T cells, rather than macrophages, was significantly inhibited by Si-Ni-San, but not Si-Ni-San(PF-). Our data indicate paeoniflorin is the principal component of Si-Ni-San, exerting negative regulation on the function of macrophages in contact dermatitis.The present study suggests that dissecting the role of specific constituents in medicinal formulas through selective deletion and replenishment may be a useful strategy in recognizing and validating an active ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine.",

        "abstract": "Artemisia vestita is a common traditional Tibetan medicinal plant which has been used widely in China for treating various inflammatory diseases. Since little is known about its active components, the purpose of this study was to isolate and identify the immunosuppressive compounds from Artemisia vestita.A bioassay-guided isolation was performed with picryl chloride-induced contact hypersensitivity in mice. MTT assay and Flow cytometric analysis were used for determining Con A-induced lymphocyte proliferation and CD25 expression in T cells, respectively.The ethanol extract of the Artemisia vestita was found to possess significant inhibitory activity against the picryl chloride-induced contact hypersensitivity in mice. Then 4 fractions were isolated by macroporous adsorption resin and one of these fractions (AV3), which showed the highest activity in in vivo test, was further subjected to column chromatography. Nine known flavones were isolated and identified as pectolinarigenin (1), jaceosidin (2), cirsilineol (3), cirsimaritin (4), hispidulin (5), quercetin (6), 6-methoxytricin (7), acacetin (8), and apigenin (9). The structures of the 9 flavones were elucidated by spectral techniques. All the compounds were evaluated for their inhibitory activity on the proliferation and activation of T cells in vitro. Among the 9 flavones, cirsilineol (3), 6-methoxytricin (7) and apigenin (9) significantly inhibited T cell proliferation and activation in the bioassays.The result suggests that cirsilineol, 6-methoxytricin and apigenin are the major active components in Artemisia vestita.",

        "abstract": "Artemisia vestita Wall., a traditional Tibetan medicine, has wide clinical application for inflammatory diseases. However, its molecular mechanism of anti-inflammatory effect is poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory activity and underlying mechanism of the ethanol extract from Artemisia vestita (AV-ext) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis. Pretreatment with AV-ext significantly decreased the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in serum and liver and lung tissues, and improved the survival of mice with experimental sepsis. AV-ext also remarkably reduced the expression levels of TNF-alpha, interleukin-1beta and cyclooxygenase-2 in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages and dose dependently suppressed the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), such as p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). Furthermore, pretreatment with AV-ext dose dependently inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), as well as the degradation and phosphorylation of inhibitory kappaB (IkappaB) in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages. These results collectively reveal that AV-ext inhibits TNF-alpha release from macrophages by suppressing MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways and suggest that AV-ext may be beneficial for the treatment of endotoxin shock or sepsis.",

The optimal conditions of separation and detection were achieved on a Lichrospher C18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 microm), with a gradient elution program, detected at 291 nm. The correlation coefficients of all the calibration curves showed good linearity (r>0.999) within test ranges. The relative deviation of this method was less than 3% for intra- and inter-day assays, and the average recoveries (n=3) were between 96.2 and 103.1%. The extraction process was also optimized as 2 h immersion and 30 min sonication in 60% ethanol. Eight samples of rhizoma smilacis glabrae from different locations in China were analyzed. The results indicate that the assay is reproducible and precise and could be readily utilized for the quality control of rhizoma smilacis glabrae.",

        "abstract": "Astilbin is a flavonoid isolated from the rhizome of Smilax glabra. In a previous study, we revealed its unique immunosuppressive activity, a selective inhibition against activated T lymphocytes. This characteristic of astilbin is beneficial for the treatment of human immune diseases.We incubated astilbin with rat liver microsomal/cytosolic fractions and isolated the metabolite of astilbin, which was fully characterized by mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We administered astilbin orally via a gastric tube to rats at 0.22 mmol/kg and collected whole blood samples after 30 min and urine samples after 0 to 12 h. We applied HPLC and liquid chromatography/MS to measure the metabolite in the samples, and we assayed cytokine expression by reverse-transcription PCR.After incubation of astilbin with rat liver microsomal/cytosolic fractions, we detected a new metabolite of astilbin and isolated it from the culture solution. We characterized this metabolite by MS and NMR techniques as 3'-O-methylated astilbin. We detected the metabolite in both blood and urine samples after oral administration of astilbin, and the metabolite inhibited picryl chloride-induced ear swelling in mice and suppressed the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma, similarly to astilbin.This is the first identification of 3'-O-methylastilbin as a new flavonoid, as well as an active metabolite of astilbin in vivo, and is helpful for studying the kinetics of astilbin and its clinical applications.",

        "title": "Selective depletion of glycyrrhizin from Si-Ni-San, a traditional Chinese prescription, blocks its effect on contact sensitivity in mice and recovers adhesion and metalloproteinases production of T lymphocytes.",
        "abstract": "In the present study, we performed to selectively deplete glycyrrhizin from Si-Ni-San, a traditional Chinese prescription that consists of 4 Chinese herbs including Radix Glycyrrhizae Uralensis, and examined its influence on the suppressing activity of Si-Ni-San against contact sensitivity in mice. An immunoaffinity column was made by covalently coupling the polyclonal antibody, obtained by the immunization with glycyrrhizin-BSA conjugate, to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. By using this column, glycyrrhizin in Si-Ni-San was selectively and almost completely depleted from the whole extract, which was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Both 200 mg/kg of Si-Ni-San and 10 mg/kg of glycyrrhizin, the dose corresponding to its proportion contained in Si-Ni-San, significantly reduced the ear swelling of picryl chloride (PCl)-induced ear contact sensitivity in mice and the inhibition by Si-Ni-San was stronger than that by glycyrrhizin. The adhesion activity to type IV collagen of the isolated spleen cells from PCl-sensitized mice was significantly decreased by both Si-Ni-San and glycyrrhizin. However, the glycyrrhizin-depleted sample of Si-Ni-San (Si-Ni-San(GL-)) only showed a slight inhibition on the cell adhesion. Furthermore, the spleen cells from PCl-sensitized mice produced more matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 than naive spleen cells did, and both Si-Ni-San and glycyrrhizin remarkably reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 production. In contrast, Si-Ni-San(GL-) only showed a slight inhibition. These results suggest that glycyrrhizin may act as one of the active constituents of Si-Ni-San in inhibiting delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction via down-regulating the MMP production and the cell adhesion to extracellular matrix. The present study also provides a new approach to recognize and validate an active constituent in traditional prescription through a selective depletion.",

In this study, we aimed at examining the anti-proliferative activity of cirsilineol against multiple types of cancer cells and the underlying mechanisms. Cirsilineol significantly inhibited proliferation of Caov-3, Skov-3, PC3 and Hela cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The compound also dose-dependently induced apoptosis in Caov-3 cells, as determined by annexin V/propidium iodide staining. Besides, cirsilineol induced a remarkable change in mitochondrial membrane potential and caused release of cytochrome c to cytosol. Furthermore, the compound caused a marked activation of capase-3, caspase-9 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). These results suggested that the induction of apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway was involved in the anti-proliferative activity of cirsilineol against cancer cells.",

        "abstract": "Previously, we demonstrated the inhibitory effects of Si-Ni-San, a traditional Chinese prescription, on picryl chloride-induced ear contact sensitivity (PCl-CS). This study aimed to evaluate the role of the four major constituents contained in the prescription (saikosaponins, paeoniflorin, naringin and glycyrrhizin) in the inhibitory effect. When administered during the induction phase, saikosaponin a and glycyrrhizin showed significant inhibitory effects, while paeoniflorin and naringin did not. These components in Si-Ni-San also inhibited the activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes as well as the production of cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma to different extents. Saikosaponin a and paeoniflorin dose-dependently reduced the splenocyte adhesion to type I collagen, while glycyrrhizin only showed a slight tendency. Furthermore, treatment with glycyrrhizin or saikosaponin a, rather than paeoniflorin or naringin, moderately inhibited the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 activity of the splenocytes from PCl-CS mice, and the combination of all four components showed a strong inhibition against MMP-2. Moreover, the components markedly decreased the serum level of nitric oxide in PCl-sensitized mice. The results indicated that saikosaponin a and glycyrrhizin may be the major contributors in the alleviation effect of Si-Ni-San on contact sensitivity, and paeoniflorin and naringin may exhibit a co-operative effect.",

        "abstract": "Objective To explore the anti-oxidation effect and mechanism of the total flavones from the leaf of Lindera aggregata (LA-flavonoids). Methods The total antioxidation and anti-superoxide anion capacities were measured to evaluate the anti-oxidation activity of LA-flavonoids in the chemical model system in vitro. Acute liver injury mice model was induced with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4),and the effect of LA-flavonoids on serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels as well as the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA),superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total anti-oxidation capacity were examined. RT-PCR was used for the determination of oxidation-related genes expression in liver tissues of mice with liver injury. Results In the chemical model system in vitro,with the increase of LA-flavonoids concentration,the total anti-oxidation and anti-superoxide anion capacities were increased. In mice with CCl4-induced acute liver injury,LA-flavonoids at the concentrations of 50\uff5e200 mg/kg significantly decreased the ALT and AST activities and MDA content,and increased the activities of SOD and total antioxidation capacity in serum. The mRNA expression of thioredoxin,heme oxygenase-1 and peroxiredoxin-1 in liver tissues were also increased by LA-flavonoids. Conclusion LA-flavonoids has protective effect against CCl4-induced acute liver injury by clearing away free radicals and inhibiting lipid peroxidation. Its antioxidant activity may be related to the regulation of some antioxidant-related genes.",

In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of Si-Ni-San and its ingredient glycyrrhizin in trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced experimental colitis in mice, a well-characterized murine model for Crohn's disease. Si-Ni-San and glycyrrhizin significantly ameliorated TNBS-induced colitis with reduced mortality and recovery of body weights. In addition, Si-Ni-San and glycyrrhizin dose-dependently decreased macroscopic inflammation scores, microscopic histological scores, and myeloperoxidase activity. Furthermore, Si-Ni-San and glycyrrhizin caused a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines including IFN-gamma, IL-12, TNF-alpha and IL-17 and an increase in regulatory cytokine IL-10 in colon of the mice. It should be noticed the therapeutic effect of Si-Ni-San at 450 mg/kg was much better than that of its contained content of glycyrrhizin at 10 mg/kg.

        "abstract": "Selectively inducing apoptosis of activated T cells is essential for the clearance of pathogenic injurious cells and subsequent efficient resolution of inflammation. However, few chemicals have been reported to trigger apoptosis of activated T cells in the treatment of hepatitis without affecting quiescent T cells. In the present study, we found that fraxinellone, a small natural compound isolated from the root bark of Dictamnus dasycarpus, selectively facilitated apoptosis of concanavalin A (Con A)-activated CD4(+) T cells rather than those non-activated, by disrupting the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, decreasing the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, and increasing cytochrome c release from the mitochondria to the cytosol. The enhancement in Fas expression and caspase-8 activity, truncation of Bid, and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein expression by fraxinellone also suggested the participation of an extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Furthermore, fraxinellone significantly alleviated Con A-induced T-cell-dependent hepatitis in mice, which was closely associated with reduced serum transaminases, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and pathologic parameters. Consistent with the in vitro results, fraxinellone dramatically induced apoptosis of activated peripheral CD4(+) T cells in vivo, consequently resulting in less CD4(+) T-cell activation and infiltration to the liver. These results strongly suggest fraxinellone might be a potential leading compound useful in treating T-cell-mediated liver disorders in humans.",

Our study indicated that the habitats of shelter have significant effects on the survival,foraging and growth of P.clarkii.Burrow has the biggest cover area which can provide protection to the greatest degree.Hiden in the burrows P.clarkii live in a relative conservative way,foraging and fighting little,which is good for survival.On the contrary,the cover area of corner is not as big as burrow,crayfish are fighting each other for shelter,their foraging and fighting behaviors are more obvious,their living strategies is relatively more adventurous,which is good for growth.",

        "abstract": "To explore the risk factors on the symptoms of lumbar intervertebral disc herniation so as to develop a predictive model for the disease.With a population-based case-control study, 303 of 50 123 residents were diagnosed as having lumbar intervertebral disc herniation symptoms. 152 cases and 167 healthy controls, matched by gender and age, were randomly chosen as case and control groups. Questionnaires were used to collect information on the exposure to risk factors and logistic predictive model was then established.Through non-conditional logistic regression analysis, data showed that the positive family history of lumbar vertebra disorder, lumbar treatment or surgery, mental stress, acute low back injury, permanent work pose, and body mass index >/= 23.0 kg/m(2) were the risk factors among residents from the countryside. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of logistic predictive model was 0.809. When 0.4 was set as the classification cutoff, the total predictive correct rate, sensitivity, and specificity were 74.0%, 73.7%, and 74.3% respectively.The occurrence of lumbar disk herniation can in countryside population was affected by multi-variables including genetic and environmental, and could be predicted with the logistic regression model established by our group. The positive predictive results could be used to alarm the patients and doctors for prevention and treatment of the disease.",

In the first step, three villages in Liuyang were selected by stratified cluster random sampling method and all local residents were investigated by face-to-face interview. Then some patients with hypertension found in the first step were randomly sampled to case group, while healthy adults with no hypertension and in similar compositions of gender and age with the case group were selected to control group. Independent effects of risk factors were analyzed by Logistic regression, and the interaction among risk factors was analyzed by using an additive effects model.Effective investigation data for 218 patients in the case group and 182 healthy people in the control group were used. The main risk factors of hypertension in rural areas of Liuyang, Hunan province were overweight (OR = 4.048), obesity (OR = 6.476), central obesity (OR = 2.632), and family history of hypertension (OR = 2.527). After adjusting some confounding factors, significant positive interaction were observed between family history, overweight/obesity and central obesity; the relative excess risk of interaction (RERI), attributable proportion of interaction (API), and the interaction index (S) were 3.268 vs 0.569, 48.365% vs 14.880%, and 2.313 vs 1.249, respectively.The cause of hypertension in rural areas of Liuyang, Hunan province was closely related with overweight, obesity, central obesity and family hypertension history.

Methods: 1 Totally 63 patients with chronic renal failure treated in the Department of Nephrology, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical College from December 2004 to February 2006 were selected, of whom, there were 16 patients with conservative therapy, and 47 haemodialysis patients, who were divided into short-term, medium-term and long-term dialysis groups according to dialysis time; 15 healthy examinees were selected as control. 2 5.0 -6.0 mL heparin-anticoagulated whole blood was harvested in the early morning or before dialysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and cultured for 24 hours after divided into 3 groups: AGE-BSA group, which was given 25 mg/L glycosylated bovine serum albumin (BSA); BSA group was given 25 mg/L BSA; control group without any intervention. 3 Twenty-four hours later, the supernatant was collected to measure the mass concentration of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) by ELISA method. Results: 1 Secretions of IL-1\u03b2 in PBMCs: The spontaneously secretions of the control group and conservative therapy group were (10.08\u00b10.77), (14.32\u00b10.54) ng/L, and the short, medium and long term dialysis groups were higher than the conservative group [(78.55\u00b17.89), (56.16\u00b11.66), (37.03\u00b11.78) ng/L, P < 0.05], and the secretion was decreased with dialysis time (P < 0.05); after BSA stimulation, IL-1\u03b2 secretion of each group changed lightly compared with the control group (P > 0.05); after AGE-BSA stimulation, IL-1\u03b2 secretion of each group was increased significantly compared with the control group (P < 0.01); the secretions of the short, medium and long term dialysis groups were lower than the conservative group [(132.09\u00b123.66), (94.09\u00b113.07), (68.14\u00b110.56), (160.34\u00b117.06) ng/L], and decreased with dialysis time (P < 0.05). 2 Secretions of TNF-\u03b1 in PBMCs: The spontaneously secretions of the control group and conservative therapy group were (8.57\u00b10.32), (10.89\u00b10.68) ng/L, and the short, medium and long term dialysis groups were higher than the conservative group [(43.12\u00b18.01), (30.78\u00b15.34), (19.06\u00b13.91) ng/L, P < 0.05], and the secretion was decreased with dialysis time (P < 0.05); after BSA stimulation, TNF-\u03b1 secretion of each group changed lightly compared with the control group (P > 0.05); after AGE-BSA stimulation, TNF-\u03b1 secretion of each group was increased significantly compared with the control group (P < 0.01); the secretions of the short, medium and long term dialysis groups were lower than the conservative group [(72.62\u00b120.11), (51.08\u00b114.78), (35.03\u00b16.67), (103.14\u00b19.05) ng/L], and decreased with dialysis time (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Microinflammation in patients with chronic renal failure is general. AGE takes part in the occurrence and development of microinflammation in chronic renal failure. Long-term haemodialysis could result in monocyte dysfunction, and worsen renal function failure.",

The control groups (n = 20, N1 and N2 group) were fed with normal diet, and the model groups (n = 30, M1, M2 and T group) were fed with fat-rich diet consisting of 0.88 standard normal diet + 0.10 lard oil + 0.02 cholesterol. Therapeutic group (T group) was treated from wk 13 and finished at wk 20. The levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total protein (TP), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high density lipoprotein (HDL) were measured. The hepatic histologic changes were observed with HE and Masson staining. RESULTS: At the end of the experiment, compared with those in the normal control groups, the liver index (t = 8.65, P < 0.01) and serum ALT (t = 4.65, P < 0.01), AST (t = 4.74, P < 0.01), ALP (t = 3.56, P < 0.01), TP (t = 6.35, P < 0.01), TC (t = 8.41, P < 0.01), and LDL (t = 8.86, P < 0.01) levels were increased significantly in the model control groups, and the hepatic steatosis (Z = -4.135, P < 0.01), inflammation (Z = -3.752, P < 0.01) and fibrosis (Z = -4.156, P < 0.01) were more serious. Compared with those in the model control groups, the serum ALT, GGT, ALP, TP, TG, and TC levels were all down-regulated in the therapeutic group without significances, while AST (t = -2.404, P < 0.05) level was reduced significantly. The degrees of hepatic steatosis and inflammation were decreased without statistical significances, but fibrosis degrees were lightened markedly (Z = -3.101, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The medical instrument on hepatic diseases of type I DSG has some therapeutic effect in treating NAFLD of rats.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To explore the in vitro effects of a novel nucleoside analog (\u03b2-LPA) against hepatitis B virus (HBV). METHODS: HepG2.2.2.15 cells were cultured and treated with various concentrations of \u03b2-LPA. Serum HBsAg and HBeAg were deter- mined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Intracelluar DNA was extracted and subjected to Southern blotting, hybridized with 32P-labeled HBV probe and autoradiographed. The intensity of the autoradiographic bands was quantified by densitometric scans of computer and ED50 value was calculated. Cytotoxicity with different concentrations of drugs was examinedby methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) method and ID50 value was calculated. RESULTS: Autoradiographic bands showed that \u03b2-LPA inhibited the replication of HBV DNA in a dose-dependent manner. ED50 value was 0.01 \u03bcmol/L. Cytotoxicity experiment showed that the ID50 value of \u03b2-LPA was 50 \u03bcmol/L. The con- tents of HBsAg and HBeAg were decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. \u03b2-LPA at a low concentration had no marked effect on HBsAg and HBeAg in supernate. CONCLUSION: \u03b2-LPA possesses potent inhibi- tory effect on the replication of HBV in vitro with little cytotoxicity.",

        "abstract": ". To investigate the effects of Tong-Xie-Yao-Fang (TXYF) on intestinal mucosal mast cells in rats with postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS). . PI-IBS rat models were established using a multistimulation paradigm. Then, rats were treated with TXYF intragastrically at doses of 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 g\u00b7kg\u00b7d for 14 days, respectively. Intestinal sensitivity was assessed based on abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scores and fecal water content (FWC). Mast cell counts and the immunofluorescence of tryptase and c-Fos in intestinal mucosa were measured; and serum IL-1, TNF-, and histamine levels were determined. . AWR reactivity and FWC which were significantly increased could be observed in PI-IBS rats. Remarkably increased mast cell activation ratio in intestinal mucosa, together with increased serum TNF- and histamine levels, could also be seen in PI-IBS rats; furthermore, PI-IBS-induced changes in mast cell activation and level of serum TNF- and histamine could be reversed by TXYF treatment. Meanwhile, tryptase and c-Fos expression were also downregulated. . TXYF improves PI-IBS symptoms by alleviating behavioral hyperalgesia and antidiarrhea, the underlying mechanism of which involves the inhibitory effects of TXYF on activating mucosal mast cells, downregulating tryptase and c-Fos expression, and reducing serum TNF- and histamine levels.",

The ethanol-soluble extracts of ginkgo biloba and Tibetan capillaris were shown to have some antimicrobial effects against S.aureus, but no antimicrobial effects against E.coli and S.cerevisiae, and all the water extracts had no inhibitory effect on the above three bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentration against S.aureus is 450 \u03bcg/mL and 160 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration of the two extracts increased with pH increasing, but the trends were weaker than potassium sorbate and benzoic acid. Under alkaline conditions, the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the two extracts were better than potassium sorbate. In mode food, extracts exhibited antimicrobial activities in combination with the two preservatives, especially benzoic acid, can completely inhibit the growth of S.aureus.",

Before and after irradiation, no marked potential bending and very low current flow are observed at GBs, suggesting that GBs behave as a charge recombination site and an obstacle for charge transport. Furthermore, CdS nano-islands are synthesized via successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method on the surface of CZTSSe.

        "abstract": "The adsorption and adlayer structure of p-nitrobenzoic acid (pNBA) on a Au(111) surface in 0.1 M HClO 4 are investigated by in-situ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and cyclic voltammetry. The pNBA adlayer is prepared by dipping Au(111) into a saturated pNBA aqueous solution. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of the so-prepared Au(111) electrode shows an irreversible cathodic peak at 0.24 V, which corresponds to the electro-reduction reaction from pNBA to hydroxylamine, and a pair of reversible peaks at ca. 0.7 V, corresponding to redox reaction of hydroxylamine to nitrosobenzoic acid. STM is employed to investigate the pNBA adlayer structure. The molecules form ordered adlayers in (16\u00d72\u221a3), (7\u00d74\u221a3) and (9\u00d76\u221a3) structures at the double layer potential region. High resolution STM image reveals the details of the molecular arrangement in the adlayers. On the basis of the STM image and the chemical structure of pNBA, structural models for three adlayers are proposed. In all three structures, pNBA molecules adsorb perpendicularly with the carboxylic groups contacting with the Au(111) substrate. The effect of dipping time on the adlayer formation is investigated. Upon shifting the electrode potentials in negative direction to induce the electroreduction reaction, the bright dots corresponding to the molecular aggregations start emerging on the surface and selectively locate at the elbow position along Au(111) reconstruction lines. The results provide direct evidence for the adsorption and electrochemical behavior of nitro-benzene derivatives. Copyright \u00a9 2011 American Scientific Publishers.",

        "abstract": "Solvent effect on chirality of 1,4-di[4-N-(trihydroxymethyl)methyl carbamoylphenyl]-2,5-didodecyloxybenzene (DTCD) self-assembled adlayer on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) is investigated by in situ scanning tunneling microscopy using tetrahydrofuran (THF), 1-phenyloctane (PO), 1-octanol, and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) as solvent. Different chiral patterns are acquired in these solvents, suggesting that the chiral assembly of DTCD is solvent-dependent. With use of THF or PO as solvent, chiral patterns with windmill-shaped tetramer units are observed. In contrast, a racemic lamellar structure is revealed in 1-octanol. The coadsorption of 1-octanol molecules makes an important contribution to the formation of racemic lamellar structure. A structure transition from racemic lamellar structure to tetramer-based chiral patterns is observed with removal of 1-octanol molecules by thermal annealing. When TCB is used as solvent, a chiral meshy structure is formed at the TCB/HOPG interface. The results reported here demonstrate that solvent can significantly affect the chirality in molecular self-assembly and provide a potential approach to finely tune the chiral molecular architectures on solid surfaces. \u00a9 2010 American Chemical Society.",

All Gn-Cn molecules self-organize into the Type I lamellar structure with close-packed alkyl side chains, whereas Type II lamellar structure with interdigitated alkyl side chains is also observed for Gn-C6 and -C8. Two different dipole-dipole interaction modes, that is, collinear and antiparallel arrangement of Schiff base molecular dipole, are proposed to modulate the formation of two types of lamellar assemblies. The results highlight that the tethered alkyl chain length is far from being a passive part of the self-assembled system and plays a definitive role in the supramolecular engineering at the liquid-solid interface. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

Under modulation of the substrate potential, three distinct phases labeled as I, II, and III are observed. DHB molecules take the flat-lying configuration and form the herringbone structure in phase I, which exists at lower potential range. DHB molecules take upstanding configuration and form short-range ordered phase II at higher potential range. A transitional phase consisted of alternately arranged flat-lying and upstanding DHB molecules is disclosed at intermediate potential. The potential induced structural transition can be ascribed to the deprotonation process of carboxylic group and redox reaction of hydroquinone moiety. The present study provides important experiment evidence for understanding the adsorption, redox, and structural transition of hydroquinone molecules on solid electrodes. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "A tri-stable structural switching between different polymorphisms is presented in 2D molecular assembly of 5-(benzyloxy)-isophthalic acid derivative (BIC-C12) at the liquid/solid interface. The assembled structure of BIC-C12 is sensitive to the applied voltage between the STM tip and the sample surface. A compact lamellar structure is exclusively observed at positive sample bias, while a porous honeycomb structure or a quadrangular structure is preferred at negative sample bias. Selective switching between the lamellar structure and the honeycomb structure or the quadrangular structure is realized by controlling the polarity and magnitude of the sample bias. The transition between the honeycomb structure and the quadrangular structure is, however, absent in the assembly. This tri-stable structural switching is closely related to the molecular concentration in the liquid phase. This result provides insights into the effect of external electric field on molecular assembly and benefits design and construction of switchable molecular architectures on surface.",

The controllable assembly and molecular adlayer structures of tetrachlorinated diPBI derivatives with different alkyl chains substitutions on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite were studied by scanning tunneling microscopy. When the molecule was substituted by butyl, the formation of multilayer or monolayer can be regulated by the solution concentration. When the molecule was substituted by 2-ethylhexyl, however, it can only form monolayer assembly. The unit cell of 2-ethylhexyl substituted diPBI adlayer was expanded to a rectangular shape compared to that of the butyl substituted diPBI. The steric repulsion of the alkyl chains (straight or branched) substitution is proposed as the key factor to control the adlayer structures of diPBI derivatives.

A linear monodendron molecular template with periodic hydrogen-bond binding sites is shown to accommodate a variety of molecules with pyridylethynyl terminals. The unit cell parameters in the transverse direction of the linear pattern can be tuned from 3.4 to 7.3 nm in response to the packing of the guest molecules with different sizes, shapes, and aggregation number. The introduction of hydrogen-bonding partners into the host template and into guest molecules is responsible for the steering of the linear pattern of guest molecules. The modular approach could greatly facilitate the ordering of guest molecules with desired functional moieties.",

Molecules with freely rotatable single bonds have many interconvertable conformers. Herein, we report the surface-adsorption-induced conformer resolution by employing azobenzene-3,3-dicarboxylic acid (ADA-33) as a model compound. Two linear assembly phases composed of trans conformers on a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface are observed by scanning tunneling microscopy. With the codeposition with 1-octanoic acid (OA), only one trans conformer of ADA-33 can be recognized by OA to form a two-component assembly with alternately arranged ADA-33 and OA stripes, which can be attributed to the epitaxial assembly of ADA-33 and OA on the HOPG surface, and weak hydrogen bonding exists between conformer I and OA molecules. The results are of significance with respect to the discrimination and resolution of conformers on a solid surface and provide molecular insights into the coadsorption assembly on the surface.",

The SAM exhibits a wormlike disordered structure from 1.0 V to 260 mV vs RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode). At 260 mV, an irreversible disorder-order phase transformation occurs and results in an ordered striped phase. High resolution STM images and DFT calculations suggest that TTCA molecules are parallel to each other within the stripes, which prompts the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions between the molecules. Each molecule adsorbs vertically on the substrate via two S atoms and one heterocyclic N atom anchoring on the surface at the bridge sites and the top site, respectively. This adsorption geometry promises the SAM with good stability (binding energy 3.27 eV) and free reactive S terminals. The high stability and free S terminals of the TTCA SAM makes it a promising scaffold for applications in molecular electronics and chem/bio sensors. \u00a9 2011 American Chemical Society.",

Herein, we report the construction of a series of 2D chiral hierarchical structures by trinary molecular self-assembly with copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), 2,3,7,8,12,13-hexahexyloxy-truxenone (TrO23), and 1,3,5-tris(10-carboxydecyloxy) benzene (TCDB). A series of flower-like chiral hierarchical molecular architectures with increased generations are formed, and the details of these structures are investigated by high resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The flower-like hierarchical molecular architectures could be described by a unified configuration in which the lobe of each architecture is composed of a different number of triangular shape building units (TBUs). The off-axis edge-to-edge packing of TBUs confers the organizational chirality of the hierarchical assemblies. On the other hand, the TBUs can tile the surface in a vertex-sharing configuration, resulting in the expansion of chiral unit cells, which thereby further modulate the periodicity of chiral voids in the multilevel hierarchical assemblies. The formation of desired hierarchical structures could be controlled through tuning the molar ratio of each component in liquid phase. The results are significant for the design and fabrication of multicomponent chiral hierarchical molecular nanostructures.",

In this contribution, we investigated the mixing behavior of 5-(benzyloxy)-isophthalic acid homologues (BIC-Cn, n = 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14) at the liquid/solid interface using a scanning tunneling microscope. Deposition of the single component of BIC-Cn always results in typical honeycomb networks, whereas co-deposition of two BIC-Cn homologues leads to hybrid double-walled honeycomb networks or phase separation depending on the difference in the length of their alkyl chains. 2D co-crystallization can only be realized for BIC-C6/BIC-C10 or BIC-C8/BIC-C12 which have a four-methyl unit difference in their alkyl chains. The size complementarity of the alkyl chains in the two components suggests that it is responsible for the 2D co-crystallization, though hydrogen bonding contributes a lot both to the pristine honeycomb network and to the hybrid co-crystal. This result is of importance for understanding the role of van der Waals interaction and its interplay with hydrogen bonding in 2D co-crystallization.",

All three thiols form oriented molecular cluster lines along the reconstruction line direction at 0.55 V. With the electrode potential shifting negatively, the molecules undergo a disordered-ordered structural transition. Molecularly resolved STM images show that all three molecules form striped adlayers in the desorption region on the Au(111) surface. The different heteroatoms in the heteroaromatic rings result in different electrochemical behavior of the MB self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). MBI, MBT, and MBO are proposed to interact with the substrate via the S-Au bonds from thiol group and the coordination interaction of N, S, and O with the substrate from the heteroaromatic ring, respectively.

        "abstract": "Hydrogen bonds with high selectivity and directionality are significant in harnessing molecules to form 2D supramolecular nanostructures. The competition and reorganization of hydrogen bond partners determine the ultimate molecular assembly and pattern in a 2D supramolecular system. In this study, multicomponent assemblies of a monodendron (5-benzyloxy-isophthalic acid derivative, BIC) and pyridylethynyl derivatives [1,4-bis(4-pyridylethynyl)-2,3-bis-dodecyloxy-benzene (PBPC12) and 1,4-bis(4-pyridylethynyl)-2,3-bis-octadecyloxy-benzene (PBPC18)] have been studied by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) on a graphite surface. BIC molecules are able to associate with PBPC12 and PBPC18 molecules to induce the rearrangement of hydrogen bond partners and form coassembly structures. Interestingly, BIC acts as a template molecule in the coassembly process, and these multicomponent structures exhibit similar structural features to the assembly structures of BIC itself. The structural details of the coassembled structures are revealed by high-resolution STM images, and their relationship with the original BIC assemblies is discussed. These results provide important insights into the design and fabrication of hydrogen-bond-directed multicomponent molecular nanostructures on solid surfaces.",

Various surface nanopatterns as molecular templates were developed by self-assembly and molecular engineering. These molecular templates were used and led to the formation of ordered assembly of alien species into designed two-dimensional matrices targeting at future applications. Both molecular template and so-fabricated nanopatterned assembly were clearly observed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). This paper summarizes some recent results on molecular templates for controlling and ordering organic molecules on solid surfaces mainly from our group. Several typical molecular templates and the consequent nanofabrication of ordered assemblies are described, including template design and fabrication, molecule ordering and patterning with the template as well as the possible application of these systems. \u00a9 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.",

Two-dimensional (2D) porous molecular networks and disordered adlayers are found, respectively, in the M and UA-M assembly on graphite. Uniformly dispersed nanoparticles of M and UA-M are found at various concentrations by AFM. Owing to complementary NH...O and NH...N hydrogen bonds, the CA-M mixture forms 2D densely packed adlayers and nanoscale crystals on graphite and aggregates into three-dimensional (3D) clusters on the surfaces. The size of the cluster is dependent on the molecular concentration. The results provide important information for the self-assembly of triazine compounds and are significant in the study of kidney disease related to melamine.",

Local electrical and optoelectronic properties of the CZTSSe thin-film are explored by Kelvin probe force microscopy and conductive atomic force microscopy. Before and after irradiation, no marked potential bending and very low current flow are observed at GBs, suggesting that GBs behave as a charge recombination site and an obstacle for charge transport. Furthermore, CdS nano-islands are synthesized via successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method on the surface of CZTSSe. By comparing the work function and current flow change of CZTSSe and CdS in dark and under illumination, we demonstrate photo-induced electrons and holes are separated at the interface of p-n junction and transferred in CdS and CZTSSe, respectively.",

Here we report the induction of global homochirality in two-dimensional enantiomorphous networks of achiral molecules via co-assembly with chiral co-absorbers. The scanning tunnelling microscopy investigations and molecular mechanics simulations demonstrate that the point chirality of the co-absorbers transfers to organizational chirality of the assembly units via enantioselective supramolecular interactions, and is then hierarchically amplified to the global homochirality of two-dimensional networks. The global homochirality of the network assembly shows nonlinear dependence on the enantiomeric excess of chiral co-absorber in the solution phase, demonstrating, for the first time, the validation of the 'majority rules' for the homochirality control of achiral molecules at the liquid/solid interface. Such an induction and nonlinear chirality amplification effect promises a new approach towards two-dimensional homochirality control and may reveal important insights into asymmetric heterogeneous catalysis, chiral separation and chiral crystallization.",

        "abstract": "Noncovalently introducing stereogenic information is a promising approach to embed chirality in achiral molecular systems. However, the interplay of the noncovalently introduced chirality with the intrinsic chirality of molecules or molecular aggregations has rarely been addressed. We report a competitive chiral expression of the noncovalent interaction\u2013mediated chirality induction and the intrinsic stereogenic center\u2013controlled chirality induction in a two-dimensional (2D) molecular assembly at the liquid/solid interface. Two enantiomorphous honeycomb networks are formed by the coassembly of an achiral 5-(benzyloxy)isophthalic acid (BIC) derivative and 1-octanol at the liquid/solid interface. The preferential formation of the globally homochiral assembly can be achieved either by using the chiral analog of 1-octanol, (S)-6-methyl-1-octanol, as a chiral coadsorber to induce chirality to the BIC assembly via noncovalent hydrogen bonding or by covalently linking a chiral center in the side chain of BIC. Both the chiral coadsorber and the intrinsically chiral BIC derivative can act as a chiral seeds to induce a preferred handedness in the assembly of the achiral BIC derivatives. Furthermore, the noncovalent interaction\u2013mediated chirality induction can restrain or even overrule the manifestation of the intrinsic chirality of the BIC molecule and dominate the handedness of the 2D molecular coassembly. This study provides insight into the interplay of intrinsically chiral centers and external chiral coadsorbers in the chiral induction, transfer, and amplification processes of 2D molecular assembly.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the mechanism in chiral transmission from a single molecule to a supramolecular level is fundamentally important to decipher the nonlinear amplification effect in the two-dimensional (2D) chiral assembly process. In this contribution, we report on the dramatically different nonlinear amplification effect in the chiral co-adsorber induced homochiral assemblies constructed by a series of homologous achiral building blocks on the graphite surface under control of the majority-rules principle. Homologous hexagonal networks are formed for 5-(benzyloxy)-isophthalic acid (BIC) derivatives with different alkyl lengths. While globally homochiral monolayers of BIC-C6 or BIC-C16 can be obtained by using a mixture of chiral co-adsorber 2-octanol with a small enantiomeric excess, such majority-rules principle based nonlinear chiral amplification is inoperative for the assembly of BIC-C10. Molecular mechanistic analysis indicates that BIC-C10 assembly can accommodate a chiral mismatched motif to form long-range ordered but short-range disordered crystalline networks, leading to the co-adsorption of enantiomers without enantioselectivity. The present results shed important insights into the significance of chirality mismatch during chiral transmission and benefit the understanding of chiral communication in a surface monolayer.",

By activating the above two reactions in one-step and employing asymmetrical substituted monomers and the 3-fold symmetric monomer 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene (TAPB), highly ordered imine-boroxine hybrid single-layered covalent organic frameworks (sCOFs) have been successfully constructed on HOPG by a gas-solid interface reaction method and characterized by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). In particular, the reaction between the -substituted monomer and TAPB generates sCOFB with a windmill structure, which is the first sCOF with surface chirality so far reported. The demonstration of the one-step synthesis of multiple linkages to form sCOFs can further enlarge the sCOF family and expand the design routes for functional 2D organic nanomaterials.",

        "abstract": "Spontaneous resolution of enantiomers is an intriguing and important phenomenon in surface chirality studies. Herein, we report on a two-dimensional (2D) structural transition from the heterochiral to homochiral assembly tuned by changing the enantiomeric excess (ee) of enantiomers in the solution phase. Enantiomers cocrystallize as racemates on the surface when the ee of the R-enantiomer (or S-enantiomer) remains below a critical value, whereas chiral segregation is achieved, and globally homochiral surfaces composed of exclusively one enantiomer are obtained as the critical ee is exceeded. The heterochiral\u2013homochiral transition is ascribed to the formation of energetically unfavored homochiral molecular dimers under the control of the majority-rules principle at high ee values. Such results present an intriguing phenomenon in chiral ordering at surfaces, promising a new enlightenment toward understanding chiral resolution and the evolution of chirality.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Two-dimensional (2D) chiral self-assembly system of 5-(benzyloxy)-isophthalic acid derivative/(S)-(+)-2-octanol/highly oriented pyrolytic graphite was studied. A combined density functional theory/molecular mechanics/molecular dynamics (DFT/MM/MD) approach for system of 2D chiral molecular self-assembly driven by hydrogen bond at the liquid/solid interface was thus proposed. Structural models of the chiral assembly were built on the basis of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images and simplified for DFT geometry optimization. Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF) was singled out as the suitable force field by comparing the optimized configurations of MM and DFT. MM and MD simulations for hexagonal unit model which better represented the 2D assemble network were then preformed with MMFF. The adhesion energy, evolution of self-assembly process and characteristic parameters of hydrogen bond were obtained and analyzed. According to the above simulation, the stabilities of the clockwise and counterclockwise enantiomorphous networks were evaluated. The calculational results were supported by STM observations and the feasibility of the simulation method was confirmed by two other systems in the presence of chiral co-absorbers (R)-(-)\u22122-octanol and achiral co-absorbers 1-octanol. This theoretical simulation method assesses the stability trend of 2D enantiomorphous assemblies with atomic scale and can be applied to the similar hydrogen bond driven 2D chirality of molecular self-assembly system.",

Accurate atomic configuration for the AS-OPV self-assembled pattern has been identified by means of multi-scale simulation combined with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments. The weak interactions which contribute to the formation of AS-OPV self-assembly are studied by analysis of non-covalent interactions existing in the system and theoretical calculation of their energy values. Investigation of the molecular structure of self-assembly and STM images at a certain temperature range is performed by molecular dynamics and density functional theory simulations. This work paves the way to explore the contribution of weak interactions for the self-assembly system, as well as providing a reference to observe the possible self-assembled structure at temperatures not convenient for direct experimental observation.",

The recombinant plasmids were then amplified in E. coli DH5\u03b1 and transformed into competent BCG. The expression of BZLF1 and LMP2A fusion proteins in recombinant-BCG (rBCG) was shown by Western blot. After the injection of recombinant-BCG into mice, antibodies against the fusion protein BZLF1 and LMP2A were measured by ELISA, and the cellular immune effects were determined by the lactate dehydrogenate (LDH) release assays. The results confirmed that the cloned genes of BCG-Ag85B and Z2A were correctly inserted into the vector pMV261. The recombinant plasmid pMVZ2A expressed Z2A in BCG effectively after transformation. The rBCG proteins were recognized by the BZLF1 (LMP2A) antibody. An ELISA demonstrated that rBCG could stimulate the generation of antibody against the fusion protein.

Sucrose, maltotriose, and maltose could be used\n as glucosyl donors for glycosylation of puerarin, but uridine-diphosphate glucose, glucose, fructose, lactose, cyclodextrin,\n and starch could not. Regardless of the position of B-ring in the (iso)flavonoids core structure, the glycosylation of the\n phenolic hydroxyl group at the 7-position of (iso)flavonoids was governed by the presence or absence of a glucosyl residue\n at 8-C. The apparent solubility of puerarin-7-O-glucoside and puerarin-7-O-isomaltoside was approximately 18 and 100 times that of natural puerarin, respectively. Like parent puerarin, puerarin-7-O-glucoside maintained its physiological ability to relax the contractions of isolated rat thoracic aortic rings in vitro induced\n by phenylephrine.

Both growing culture and resting cells could transform IMI into 5-hydroxy IMI. Adding 2%\n sucrose to the growing culture transformation broth and 5% sucrose to the resting cell transformation broth resulted in biotransformation\n yields, respectively, 2.5 and 9 times greater than without sucrose. In the growing culture transformation, sucrose increased\n biomass, which led to enhance hydroxylation of IMI. In the resting cell transformation, sucrose was used not as a carbon source\n but as an energy source for cofactor regeneration for hydroxylation of IMI. The hydroxylation activity of IMI was promoted\n eightfold by adding reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to the cell-free extract. The hydroxylation of IMI was\n significantly inhibited by P450 inhibitor piperonyl butoxide. It seems that the hydroxylation of IMI by S.\n maltophilia CGMCC 1.1788 might proceed through a system by cooperating with P450 enzyme.",

IM 2-1 retained\n only 10.5% contact activity and 13.1% oral activity of AAP against horsebean aphid. Time course of biotransformation under\n existing of sucrose revealed that 58.9% of AAP disappeared, but only 16.7% of reduced AAP was transformed to IM 2-1, after\n 8\u00a0days. Both demethylation and degradation of AAP contribute to the weak bioefficacy of AAP in soil application.

The enzyme catalyzed the stereoselective hydroxylation at position C12 of IMI in the imidazolidine ring. Under acidic conditions, 5-hydroxyl IMI was converted into olefin IMI in high molar conversion yield. The olefin IMI exhibited about 19 and 2.2 times more insecticidal efficacy than IMI against horsebean aphid imago and nymph, respectively, and about 1.4 times more active than IMI against brown planthopper imago. The transformation rate of IMI by resting cells of S. maltophilia CGMCC 1.1788 was promoted significantly by some carbohydrates and organic acids.

        "abstract": "A nicotinate dehydrogenase (NaDH) gene cluster was cloned from Comamonas testosteroni JA1. The enzyme, termed NaDH(JA1), is composed of 21, 82, and 46 kDa subunits, respectivley containing [2Fe2S], Mo(V) and cytochrome c domains. The recombinant NaDH(JA1) can catalyze the hydroxylation of nicotinate and 3-cyanopyridine. NaDH(JA1) protein exhibits 52.8% identity to the amino acid sequence of NaDH(KT2440) from P. putida KT2440. Sequence alignment analysis showed that the [2Fe2S] domain in NaDH(JA1) had a type II [2Fe-2S] motif and a type I [2Fe-2S] motif, while the same domain in NaDH(KT2440) had only a type II [2Fe-2S] motif. NaDH(KT2440) had an additional hypoxanthine dehydrogenase motif that NaDH(JA1) does not have. When the small unit of NaDH(JA1) was replaced by the small subunit from NaDH(KT2440), the hybrid protein was able to catalyze the hydroxylation of nicotinate, but lost the ability to catalyze hydroxylation of 3-cyanopyridine. In contrast, after replacement of the small subunit of NaDH(KT2440) with the small subunit from NaDH(JA1), the resulting hybrid protein NaDH(JAS+KTL) acquired the ability to hydroxylate 3-cyanopyridine. The subunits swap results indicate the [2Fe2S] motif determines the 3-cyanopyridine hydroxylation ability, which is evidently different from the previous belief that the Mo motif determines substrate specificity.",

Here we first report that S. maltophilia CGMCC 1.1788 can demethylate acetamiprid (AAP) to form IM 2-1 that was characterized by HPLC-MS/MS and NMR. IM 2-1 retained only 10.5% contact activity and 13.1% oral activity of AAP against horsebean aphid. Time course of biotransformation under existing of sucrose revealed that 58.9% of AAP disappeared, but only 16.7% of reduced AAP was transformed to IM 2-1, after 8 days. Both demethylation and degradation of AAP contribute to the weak bioefficacy of AAP in soil application. The differences in metabolism and detoxification pathways between AAP and IMI are probably originated from the structural differences of these insecticides.",

However in the laboratory under simulated sunlight, olefin IMI was unstable and easily degraded. Its photolytic reaction fitted the first-order kinetic equation (r>0. 99), and its half life was figured out to be 4 days. Its photolytic reaction followed two pathways, either through hydroxylation into 4,5-dihydroxy IMI, which is oxidized, breaking its nitroimine pharmacophore and turned into carbonyl product, or through formation of guanidine metabolites by breaking off nitroimine group.",

Some Pseudomonas species were reported to be able to convert nicotinic acid to 6-hydroxynicotinate by nicotinate dehydrogenase. So far, previous\n reports on NaDH in Pseudomonas genus were confused and contradictory each other. Recently, Ashraf et al. reported an NaDH gene cloned from Eubacterium barkeri and suggested some deducted NaDH genes from other nine bacteria. But they did not demonstrate the activity of recombinant\n NaDH and did not mention NaDH gene in Pseudomonas. In this study we cloned the gene of NaDH, ndhSL, from Pseudomonas putida KT2440. NdhSL in P. putida KT2440 is composed of two subunits. The small subunit contains [2Fe2S] iron sulfur domain, while the large subunit contains\n domains of molybdenum cofactor and cytochrome c. Expression of recombinant ndhSL in P. entomophila L48, which lacks the ability to produce 6-hydroxynicotinate, enabled the resting cell and cell extract of engineering P. entomophila L48 to hydroxylate nicotinate. Gene knockout and recovery studies further confirmed the ndhSL function.",

Sucrose, maltotriose, and maltose could be used as glucosyl donors for glycosylation of puerarin, but uridine-diphosphate glucose, glucose, fructose, lactose, cyclodextrin, and starch could not. Regardless of the position of B-ring in the (iso)flavonoids core structure, the glycosylation of the phenolic hydroxyl group at the 7-position of (iso)flavonoids was governed by the presence or absence of a glucosyl residue at 8-C. The apparent solubility of puerarin-7-O-glucoside and puerarin-7-O-isomaltoside was approximately 18 and 100 times that of natural puerarin, respectively. Like parent puerarin, puerarin-7-O-glucoside maintained its physiological ability to relax the contractions of isolated rat thoracic aortic rings in vitro induced by phenylephrine. However, puerarin-7-O-glucoside was able to maintain higher plasma concentrations and have a longer mean residence time in the blood than the parent puerarin.",

        "abstract": "Separation of Puerarin-7-O-glucoside from its precursor, puerarin, using a common chromatography column packed with AB-8 macroporous resin was unsuccessful. Therefore, in this study a 8 m super-long flexible reinforced PVC column was externally added to the common column in order to improve the chromatography efficiency by increasing the number of theoretical plates. Both the PVC and common columns were separately packed with AB-8 macroporous resin slurry. The packed PVC column was coiled after washing and stored until use. The microbial transformation mixture with puerarin-7-O-glucoside and puerarin (250 mL) was loaded onto the common column, followed by washing with 2000 mL H(2)O. After attaching the coiled external PVC column to the common column, a linear gradient of 10-30% ethanol was applied to elute the target compound. Two peaks appeared: peak I contained puerarin-7-O-glucoside at 97.9% purity and 88.1% recovery rate, and peak II was puerarin at 98.7% purity and 87.0% recovery rate. The use of the coiled external flexible reinforced PVC column avoided spatial restriction for long columns, which made it much more convenient for column packing and chromatography operations. Furthermore, this method eliminated the resin blockage problem caused by stationary water pressure in a rigid vertical long column. Using an external super-long column, the PVC tube was connected with the common column only during elution, which avoided delay in time period during sample loading and column washes associated with the use of long external columns.",

With the increasing of continuous planting years, the Shannon index and Margalef index of bacterial community in the rhizosphere soils decreased after an initial increase. After 4-year continuous planting, the diversity of the bacterial community decreased significantly, and the community structure became simple. The similarity coefficient of the bacterial community in the rhizosphere soils of continuously planting burley tobacco for 1 and 2 years and of the control was decreased with increasing year of continuous planting. Actinobacteria were predominant in the soils under 1 and 2 years continuous planting and in the control, but decreased in the soil continuously planted with burley tobacco for 4 years, in which, Bacilli of Firmicute was the dominant. It was suggested that continuously planting burley tobacco could result in the decrease of beneficial microbes such as Sphingomonas and Streptomyces while increase the species of pathogenic bacteria such as Bacillus cereus in rhizosphere soil, which in return, could lead to the imbalance of bacterial community and deteriorate the micro-ecological conditions in rhizosphere soil.",

        "abstract": "From the perspectives of developmental genetics and molecular ecology,this study reviewed the current state and issues of local and international rice grain-filling research.The authors contended that rice grain development was a complicated molecular ecological process,involving signal transductions,multi-gene regulations and environmental interactions.Different gene expressions in space and time,coupled with the action modes of functional proteins in superior and inferior grains caused significant differences in developmental programs of endosperm cells,grain-filling rates and dry matter accumulation at different spikelet positions on the panicle.Previous studies showed that superior grains were usually filled earlier and faster,leading to a significant genetic stability.The reverse was true for inferior grains,where stagnant and poor properties were associated with seed development and grain filling.It was noted that genetic characters were easily regulated by environmental factors during inferior rice grain-filling.Molecular ge-netic manipulations and molecular ecological regulations were two effective ways of improving inferior grain endosperm cell devel-opment,timely initiation of inferior grain filling,high percent setting and 1000-grain weight,and high yield.It was therefore em-phasized to deeply understand the underlying mechanisms and properties of genetic ecology in grain filling(and especially in inferior grain-filling processes).This had become a priority grain production research area across the globe.Based on current understandings,it was suggested to focus further studies on investigating and answering the critical scientific questions of why there existed a stag-nant phase in inferior grain filling and how different were protein expressions and associated functions of relevant genes between superior and inferior grains during the period of grain-filling.",

        "abstract": "ince allelopathy was defined by Rice in 1984,important research progress has been made on the plant allelopathy.Previous studies demonstrated that plant allelopathy has four types(or action modes),amensalism,autotoxicity,stimulation and facilitation.Plant allelopathy was widely understood as the harmful effects(amensalism) of one plant on another plant due to chemicals that were released into the environment,especially into the soil environment.Increasing studies showed that plant allelopathy was the result of the comprehensive effect of plant-microbe interactions mediated by root exudates.Amensalism has been applied in weeds control,and great achievements have been made in the practice.Allelopathic autotoxicity,also known as consecutive monoculture problems,was shown as serious soil disease in plants,consequently resulting in decreased biomass and quality of plant under consecutive monoculture.The allelopathic autotoxicity of medical herbs,especially those with tuberous roots for medicinal use,was just the case with much more sensitive reaction.Recent researches has displayed that the ecological effects of soil microbial functional disorder mediated by root exudates were the main reasons for the consecutive monoculture problems.The findings suggested that the improvement of disease-conducive soil environment was crucial to the remediation of unbalanced microbial community consturcture,and increase of ecosystem functions to overcome the problems.Positive allelopathic stimulation referred to that the monocultured plants graw well,showing higher biomass and better quality with the increasing years of consecutive cropping.Although the mechanism for positive allelopathic stimulation was not deeply understood,it suggested that the ecological phenomena mainly resulted from the improvement of soil microbial community constructure and their interaction mediated by root exudates,including positive and negative facilitation among microorganisms in rhizosphere soil,and hence increased soil fertility and nutrient supply ability,thereby,enforced root resistance to disease,consequently resulted in enhanced plant yield and quality.Achyranthes bidentata Blume was found to be a typical medicinal plant with positive allelopatic effects after continuously monocultured,and had been used as a rotation/intercropping crop with other medicinal plants sensitive to consecutive cropping to keep sustainable production of medicinal herbs.Positive interspecific interactions(facilitation) including commensalism,mutualism and protocooperation,have become a hotspot at home and abroad.Many scholars found that the mutually beneficial relationships in rhizosphere between plant species,especially the plant-microbe interactions mediated by root exudates,played important roles in the yield increase of intercropping system and efficient utilization of soil nutrients.Finally,the authors emphasized that the compositon of metagenome of the complex plant-associated microbial community existing in rhizosphere was the key to the crop plants whether they can healthily grow in the monoculture system.More in-depth studies in the second genome and oriented control of rhizospheric biological processes based on the principle and technology of modern synthetic biology would become the priority research areas to promote the sustainable development of agricultural production.",

The results showed that the Shannon diversity index, Margalef index, and similarity index of bacterial community in the rhizosphere soil all decreased in the order of control > one-year cropping > two-year continuous cropping. Under continuous cropping, the proportion of dominant bacterial species declined obviously. In one-year cropping soil, the class Bacilli of phylum Firmicute dominated the bacteria community; while in two-year continuous cropping soil, the class Epsilonproteobacteria of phylum Proteobacteria became dominant. Continuous cropping of R. glutinosa decreased the bacteria species, and simplified the bacterial community structure. The changes of bacterial community diversity under continuous cropping of R. glutinosa led to the disorder of the functions of bacterial community, and thereby, the destruction of the ecological balance in rhizosphere soil, which might be one of reasons causing the obstacles of continuous cropping of R. glutinosa.",

        "abstract": "Aims Soil microbes play a key role in material recycling and energy conversion in forest ecosystems. We studied the functional diversity of microbial communities and soil physical-chemical properties in order to illustrate variations of soil microbial community diversity along an elevational gradient in the Wuyi Mountains of China and influencing factors. Methods Evergreen broad-leaved forest (EBF), coniferous forest (CF), dwarf forest (DF) and alpine meadow (AM) were chosen as experimental sites along an elevation gradient in the National Natural Reserve of the Wuyi Mountains. We used Biolog EcoPlate analysis to study the functional diversity of microbial communities. Important findings There were significant differences in functional diversity of microbial communities in different soil elevations. The average well color development (AWCD), which directly reflected microbial activity and functional diversity, increased over time, while AWCD at the same soil depth gradually decreased along with increasing altitude and in the order of EBF > CF > DF > AM. The AWCD of different soil depths for the same vegetation type was in the order of 0\u201310 cm > 10\u201325 cm > 25\u201340 cm. The Simpson index, Shannon-Wiener index, richness index and McIntosh index of EBF were all higher than AM. There was variation among substrates used by soil microbial communities in different soil elevations. The substrate used in EBF was significantly higher than the substrate used in AM. The carbon sources mostly used by soil microbes were carbohydrates and carboxylic acids, followed by amino acids, phenolic acids and polymers; the lowest was amines. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified two factors in relation to carbon sources; they explained 75.27% and 16.14% of the variation. The carbon sources used by soil microbial communities were different among different vegetationtypes. Amino acids and amides were the two main carbon sources separating the two principal component factors. Soil microbial community diversity decreased along the elevation gradient and with soil thickness, and vegetative biomass, forest litter, soil nutrient, microzoon and plant roots might be the major factors controlling this diversity.",

        "abstract": "The authors reviewed the developmental history and characteristics of agroecology,and pointed out that the research areas of agroecology were broadening in both macroscopic and microscopic aspects,and the researches were going more deeply.On the macroscopic level,the investigation of agroecology was expanding from a pure macroscopic study of agricultural biology to a sociological study concerning the issues related to agriculture,farmer and rural areas.The research works shifted from the relationships between structure and function of agroecosystem to the food system.The major task was to study the impacts of the energy and material flow in agroecosystem on the social and economic development,and the regulation of food system by policy and laws from the eco-economic perspective.Modern agroecology emphasized the awakening of social ecological consciousness and the important role of ecological consciousness which played great roles in the protection of argoecosystem and the promotion of pollution-free production.Therefore,in western countries,community movements or actions were important ways that agroecologists relied on to make government,production units,sell units and administrations accept the agroecological concepts,act in compliance with agroecological laws and ensure the health and efficiency of the food system.These activities had become essential subjects in the education,research and practice of modern agroecology,which involved all processes in agroecology,including scientific research,demonstration and its extension of experiments,promotion by society or association actions,spontaneous participation of publics.All these efforts embodied the feature of the modern agroecology. On the microscopic level,modern agroecology was entering the age of molecular agroecology.Molecular agroecology employed the state-of-art techniques of modern biology and introduced the theories and assays from systems biology to unveil the underlying relationships and mechanisms of the structure and function of agroecosystem.With the development of modern biology techniques,especially the breakthroughs of environmental(meta-) genomics and proteomics,molecular agroecology largely enriched our knowledge of the unknown biological world.The ability to analyze biodiversity and genetic diversity in depth enabled molecular agroecology to examine the processes and mechanisms underlying ecosystem development on the molecular level,which fueled the transformation of agroecology from a qualitative and half-quantitative study into a quantitative and mechanism study.This change urged the agroecologists to keep pace with the times.The agroecologists needed to improve their knowledge structure and scientific research ability in order to follow the transformation of agroecology from traditional science into modern science.This article took many case-studies as examples to demonstrate the necessity and importance of this scientific development,and aimed at inspiring introspection and thinking among peers.",

        "abstract": "An experiment was conducted on the allelopathic effects of rhizospheric soil extracts (by water and polarity solvents) from newly planted and ratoon sugarcane (\"FN28\",\"GZ18\") and non-sugarcane (CK) soils.Putative allelochemicals of the rhizospheric soil extracts were then identified via GC-MS.In comparison with CK,high concentration water extracts inhibit lettuce growth whereas low concentration extracts promote growth.Inhibitory effects of rhizospheric soil water extracts of ratoon sugarcane are higher than that of newly planted sugarcane.Rhizospheric soil extracts from newly planted and ratoon sugarcanes by weak polarity petroleum ether and ether solvents promote lettuce growth.The reverse is true for extracts by medium polarity chloroform and strong polarity methanol.Further allelochemical analysis suggests that inhibitory effect of methanol extract is the strongest.Allelopathic effect of rhizospheric soil of \"GZ18\" is higher than that of \"FN28\" both by water extracting and polarity solvent extracting.GC-MS analysis of methanol extract substances from \"GZ18\" rhizospheric soils shows 54 compounds related with allelopathy,including acids,terpenoids,phenols,steroids and esters.",

The results reveal 7 proteins with regular patterns of daily change in expression abundance and 6 of them are successfully identified and predicted. The proteins are chloroplast photosystem I reaction center subunit \u2161-proteinoid (spot 1 protein),UMP/CMP kinase b (spot 2 protein),OSJNBa0027P08.12 protein (spot 3 protein),putative reductase (spot 4 protein),putative chaperonin (spot 5 protein) and putative sesquiterpene cyclase 1 (spot 6 protein). Expression abundance of all identified proteins drop at midday (12:00 \uff5e 14:00),except for spots 2 and 3 proteins. This implies that the molecular behavior ecological properties are related to deferentially expressed protein abundance in functional rice leaves in response to changes in daylight.",

        "abstract": "By using phospholipid fatty acid biomarkers(PLFAs),this paper studied the microbial diversity in the rhizosphere soils of 1-,6-,and 20-year-old tea trees.In the rhizosphere soil of 6-year-old tea trees,the total amount of PLFAs was the highest,and the PLFAs contents of bacteria,actinomycetes,and protozoa were higher than those in the other rhizosphere soils.The rhizosphere soil of 20-year-old tea trees had a higher content of fungi PLFAs but lower contents actinomycetes and protozoa PLFAs than the other rhizosphere soils,whereas the content of bacterial PLFAs was close to that in the rhizosphere soil of 1-year-old tea trees.In the rhizosphere soil of 20-year-old tea trees,the abundance of several microbial groups participating in soil nutrient cycling declined,while the abundance of several microbial groups with low metabolic capacity increased.As compared with those in the rhizosphere soil of 6-year-old teat trees,the activities of urease,phosphomonoesterase and peroxidase in the rhizosphere soil of 20-year-old tea trees were lower,while the activities of invertase and polyphenol oxidase were higher.In the rhizosphere soils of different planting year tea trees,the PLFAs of different microbial groups were closely correlated to the soil enzyme activities and fertility factors.With the increasing year of tea planting,the microbial community structure in rhizosphere soils changed greatly,reflecting in the decline of microbial diversity and the increase of the microbial groups with low metabolic capacity and adapting to poor soil condition,and the soil quality and the activities of some key enzymes had a larger decrement.",

Acid-catalyzed solutions of \u03b3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane mixed with gemanium isopropoxide are used as matrix precursors. Thermal gravimetric analysis, UV\u2013visible spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy are used to study the structural and optical properties of the thin films. The results indicate that crack-free and high transparency in the visible and near infrared range thin films with a thickness of about 0.7 \u03bcm can be obtained by a single spin-coating process after a heat treatment at 500 \u00b0C.

The effect of Nd 3+ doping concentration on up-conversion emission of the thin films is studied. An intense room-temperature violet up-conversion emission at 397 nm is observed from the thin film with an optimum Nd 3+ concentration of 0.5 mol% upon excitation with a xenon lamp at the wavelength of 586 nm.

Germania\u2013silica 1 Introduction Sol\u2013gel techniques have been playing significant role towards the development of optical materials in the planar waveguide film format for use in integrated optics [1\u20133] , this is because it can provide different rare-earth-ion-doped silica glasses at much lower temperature without melting the materials and it has successfully been applied to obtain planar and stripe waveguides with low propagation loss for integrated optics applications. Among the different systems which can be obtained by sol\u2013gel technique, GeO 2 \u2013SiO 2 has been recognized as being excellent for obtaining optical waveguide films with controllable refractive index [4,5] and a large concentration dopant of rare-earth ions [6,7] . Especially, with great advances in the development of semiconductor laser diodes in recent years has stimulated researches in the areas of the up-conversion pumped by laser diodes due to the potential applications in numerous photonic devices including three-dimensional displays, high-density optical data reading and storage, up-conversion lasers, infrared laser viewers and indicators [8\u201311] . Moreover, the GeO 2 -based systems are photosensitive, which can be employed for the formation of photorefractive Bragg grating [12] . Due to such promising applications, a number of research groups have reported progress in such material systems doped rare-earth ions by the sol\u2013gel route [13,14] . However, these reported material systems generally employ tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as a SiO 2 source, the heat treatment temperature needs quite high (around 1000 \u00b0C) and it is very difficult to produce a thicker than 0.2 \u03bcm by a single-coating process. This is because a large shrinkage of the film during the thermal densification process causes cracking in a thicker layer. In this work, we present the optical properties in neodymium-doped GeO 2 \u2013SiO 2 waveguide films obtained by the sol\u2013gel technique. Here, organically modified silane (\u03b3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane) was used as a precursor for SiO 2 to expect obtaining a thicker single layer GeO 2 \u2013SiO 2 waveguide film. In addition, we also report the effects of the heat treatment temperature and neodymium ion doping concentration on up-conversion emission properties of the waveguide films. 2 Experimental procedure GeO 2 \u2013SiO 2 sols were prepared from germanium isopropoxide (TEOG, Ge[OCH(CH 3 ) 2 ] 4 ) and \u03b3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GLYMO, (CH 2 OCH)CH 2 O(CH 2 ) 3 Si(OCH 3 ) 3 )) hybrid system, which were used as precursors for GeO 2 and SiO 2 resources, respectively. Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37 wt% in water) was used as catalyst, 2-methoxyethanol (CH 3 OCH 2 CH 2 OH) as chelating agent of TEOG, ethanol as solvent and de-ionized water for hydrolysis. One mole of GLYMO was mixed with 4 mol of ethanol and 4 mol of de-ionized water, and after being stirred for about 30 min, 0.01 molar hydrochloric acid was added into the solution. Then the solution was stirred for an hour again. TEOG was added to 2-methoxyethanol at a molar ratio of 1:4 and the solution was agitated until homogenization was reached. Then, the two solutions were mixed with a molar ratio of TEOG to GLYMO=30:70. Neodymium nitrate was dissolved in ethanol and added drop-by-drop to the 30GeO 2 \u201370GLYMO solution to obtain with an Nd/(GeO 2 +GLYMO) molar concentration of 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mol% Nd 3+ , respectively. The final mixture was stirred for about 2 days at room temperature. Following the common practice for spin coating, a 0.1 \u03bcm pore filter was attached to a syringe in removing foreign particles before the resultant solution was spin-coated onto a substrate. The substrates, including quartz and silicon, were used in our experiment. One layer of the sol\u2013gel thin film was spun onto the substrate at 3500 rpm for 30 s. The film-coated samples were then heated for 10 min at different temperatures of 400, 500, and 600 \u00b0C. It should be mentioned here that all reaction and manipulations were carried out under dry nitrogen environment due to the extreme moisture sensitivity of the germanium alkoxides. GeO 2 \u2013SiO 2 waveguide films (or powders) were characterized by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), UV\u2013visible (UV\u2013VIS) spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). A Perkin\u2013Elmer 7 Series was used for TGA measurement of the gel powder obtained from the corresponding solution, which was done at a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C/min in a flowing nitrogen gas environment. The UV\u2013VIS absorption spectra were measured for the films deposited on quartz in the range of 200\u20131000 nm on an UV\u2013VIS spectrometer, which has a resolution of \u00b10.3 nm. The FTIR spectra of the films deposited on silicon substrates were measured in the range of 4000\u2013400 cm \u22121 with a resolution of \u00b11 cm \u22121 . The up-conversion emission spectra of the Nd 3+ -doped GeO 2 \u2013SiO 2 thin films were measured under a yellow light excitation at the wavelength of 586 nm on a Spex Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer with a 1934D3 phosphorimeter attached. This system employs the Datamax software package to acquire the spectra. The source of excitation is a Xe continuous wavelength (cw) source for the steady state up-conversion emission measurement. 3 Results and discussion The thickness of the film was estimated by a Filmetrics F20 thin-film measurement system and a thickness of about 0.7 \u03bcm could be obtained on the quartz or silicon substrate by a single spin-coating process at a heat treatment temperature of 500 \u00b0C. Fig. 1 shows the optical transmittance spectra of the films deposited on the quartz and heated at different temperatures. It can be seen that the films are transparent and colorless. All films have high transmittance, and the transmittance of the film increases with the increase of the heat treatment temperature. For example, the film heated at 400 \u00b0C shows a relative low transmittance at short wavelength range as compared with those of the films heated at 500 and 600 \u00b0C. This is probably related to those organic compounds which remained inside the thin films, as well as the holes produced due to the incomplete combustion and decomposition of the organic compounds at the heat treatment of 400 \u00b0C. It should be mentioned here for both films heated at 500 and 600 \u00b0C that a strong UV absorption at short wavelengths \u223c200 nm accompanied with an obvious shoulder absorption located at \u223c240 nm can be identified. There is a consensus over the assignment of the absorption band at round \u223c200 nm to Si E\u2032 and Ge E\u2032 centers [15,16] . The absorption at \u223c240 nm is also well characterized and associated with an increase in the concentration of neutral oxygen monovacancies defects [17] . For the film heated at 400 \u00b0C, there is no obvious \u223c240 nm absorption band observed, an explanation is that the large degree of scattering of incident light by the holes caused by the incomplete combustion and decomposition of the organic compounds covers the \u223c240 nm absorption band. It can be also seen that the film heated at 500 or 600 \u00b0C has a relative high transmittance as compared with that heated at 400 \u00b0C. When the heat treatment temperature was increased to 500 \u00b0C or above, the organic compounds have been combusted or decomposed and a relative dense film was probably formed. Consequently, the scattering and absorption caused by the relative large holes was substantially suppressed. In order to understand these results well, TGA was employed to characterize the thermal process of the sample. Fig. 2 shows the TGA curves of the gel powder. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the weight loss occurs at three stages mainly, namely, below 100 \u00b0C, between 350 and 450 \u00b0C, and from 450 to 520 \u00b0C. Below 100 \u00b0C, the weight loss is considered to be due to the evaporation of water and the volatilization and thermal decomposition of the remnant of organic solvents. Between 350 and 450 \u00b0C, the weight loss is attributed to the carbonization or combustion of the organic compounds. Between 450 and 520 \u00b0C, the weight loss is probably ascribed to the evaporation of physically absorbed water and the further combustion of the organic compounds. As there is no major weight loss afterwards, it can be considered that the organic compounds have been completely burnt off and the sample to be inorganic glass. It can be seen clearly from Fig. 2 that the obvious and faster weight loss occurs at the stage between 350 and 450 \u00b0C. Obviously, these results are helpful to understand the results obtained by UV\u2013VIS spectra, where the film heated at 400 \u00b0C shows a relative low transmittance due to the incomplete combustion and decomposition of the organic compounds at the heat treatment of 400 \u00b0C. Fig. 3 shows the FTIR absorption spectra of the films deposited on the silicon substrates and heated at different temperatures. The main band peak at about 1100 cm \u22121 is assigned to be Si\u2013O\u2013R stretching vibrations of O\u2013R groups directly bonded to silicon. This band intensity increases with an increase of the heat treatment temperature. The peak at 600 cm \u22121 observed for all the films is from the silicon substrate. The band at 970 cm \u22121 present in every film, is attributed to Ge\u2013O\u2013Ge anti-symmetric stretching. Furthermore, a broad band between 3100 and 3600 cm \u22121 is attributed to O\u2013H stretching vibration. It should be noted that the OH stretching vibration is still observed in the film heated even at 600 \u00b0C and the intensity of the O\u2013H broad band is not weakened obviously with the increase of the heat treatment temperature. An accurate quantitative calculation of the OH content in our films was not made due to the difficulties in measurement. The up-conversion was observed under cw xenon lamp excitation. A yellow light at 586 nm ( 4 I 9/2 \u2192 4 G 5/2 ) was chose as an excitation of the up-conversion to measure the emission spectra of the films doped with neodymium ions. Fig. 4(a) shows the up-conversion emission spectra of the films having different neodymium ion content and heated at 500 \u00b0C. It should be noted that there are two-layer films deposited on the quartz. It can be seen from Fig. 4(a) that apart from a bright violet up-conversion emission transition at 397 nm corresponding to the 4 D 3/2 \u2192 4 I 13/2 or 2 P 3/2 \u2192 4 I 11/2 transitions of the neodymium ions, a relative weak ultraviolet emission transition at 371 nm ( 4 D 3/2 \u2192 4 I 11/2 or 2 P 3/2 \u2192 4 I 9/2 ) and a blue emission transition at 469 nm ( 4 D 3/2 \u2192 4 I 15/2 or 2 P 3/2 \u2192 4 I 13/2 ) are also observed. Obviously, the film doped with 0.5 mol% Nd 3+ has the highest intensity of up-conversion emission transition. With increase in neodymium ion molar concentration, the up-conversion emission intensity first increases and then decreases due to concentration quenching effect which results from the cross-relaxation process as a result of the reduced inter-ionic distance at higher neodymium ion content. Fig. 4(b) shows the up-conversion emission spectra of the 0.5 mol% Nd 3+ -doped two-layer films deposited on the quartz and heated at different heat treatment temperatures. The spectra illustrate clearly that the up-conversion emission intensity of the film changes with the heat treatment temperature. However, the peak position and the shape of the spectra are independent of the heat treatment temperature. The up-conversion emission intensity of the film heated at 600 \u00b0C is the highest of all the films measured. The result indicates that with an increase of the heat treatment temperature, the up-conversion emission intensity increases due to a more dense thin film. It can be explained that the observed up-conversion emission in Fig. 4 is a result of a sequential two-photon absorption process. Ref. [18] provides the schematic diagram to explain the mechanism of up-conversion emission from a neodymium ion via a two-photon absorption process. In this process, by an initial absorption of a 586 nm photon, electron from the ground state of 4 I 9/2 first gets excited to an upper state of 4 G 5/2 . Since this state is unstable, the electron rapidly decays non-radiatively to a metastable 4 F 3/2 level. Because this metastable level has a relative long lifetime, before it further decays, the electron has a good chance to absorb a second 586 nm photon and excited to the 4 D 3/2 state. Afterwards, some electrons could decay radiatively to the 4 I J ( J = 11 2 , 13 2 , and 15 2 ) states, resulting up-conversion emission transitions, or electrons could decay non-radiatively firstly to the 2 P 3/2 state, and then cause other up-conversion photon emissions again. 4 Conclusion Nd 3+ -doped GeO 2 \u2013SiO 2 thin films with an about 0.7 \u03bcm thick have been studied for photonic applications by the sol\u2013gel process from an organically modified silane precursors. The optical and structural properties of the thin films have been characterized by TGA, UV\u2013VIS and FTIR spectroscopy. Up-conversion luminescence emission of the thin films deposited on quartz heated at different temperatures and doped with different Nd 3+ concentration have been measured. Experimental results show a strong violet up-conversion at 397 nm, a UV emission at 371 nm, and a blue emission at 469 nm. The up-conversion mechanism has been proposed due to a sequential two-photon absorption process upon excitation with a yellow radiation at 586 nm from xenon lamp source.

The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and Raman spectra showed that with the temperature increasing from 500 \u00b0C to 750 \u00b0C, the average diameter of most CNTs decreased, and the crystallinity of the nanotubes increases as shown by the narrower and more intense G peak in the Raman spectra.

The carbon nanotubes field emission display (c-FED) has the potentials to be developed as a flat panel display for large screen TV applications [6,7] , because the cathodes and anodes can be formed by a low cost screen-printing process [8,9,23] . It eliminates sophisticated process steps (such as micron range lithography), and enables a lower investment in equipment and facilities [20\u201322] . Many fabrication techniques including chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [12,20] , DC arc discharge [10] and laser ablation [11] can produce an amount of CNTs. Arc-grown CNTs based FED has been reported [25] , however the preparation of arc-grown CNTs cathode needs several steps, such as purification. Due to its simplicity, low cost, and high yield, CVD-grown CNTs are believed to be the most promising material for screen-printed FED cathode [12,13] . For CVD process, many parameters such as the temperature, the pressure, carbon source and the catalyst can affect the morphology and structure of CNTs, therefore affect FE properties of the screen-printed CNTs cathode. There are some reports on the temperature effect on the morphology of CNTs grown on Si/glass substrate with catalyst films [14\u201316] or directly on metallic substrates [17\u201319] , but growth temperature effect on FE properties of CVD-grown CNTs used as field emission cathode by screen printing is not well known [23,24] . In this work, the morphologies depending on the CNTs growth condition factor were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Raman spectrum was also used to know the structure of as-grown CNTs. By using I \u2013 V , luminescence image measurements, the dependence of FE properties on the CNTs growth temperature was studied. 2 Experiment The multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were synthesized by thermal CVD system (made by Shanghai Nanoking Ltd. Co.) as the field emission cathode materials. CNTs were grown on nickel plate with the thickness of 0.4 mm, in the H 2 ambient at the temperature of 500\u2013750 \u00b0C, using acetylene (C 2 H 2 ) as the carbon source. The CNTs grown at different conditions were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM LV5610). A Raman spectrometer (Renishow 1000) was also used to identify the structure and the crystallinity of CNTs. The 514.5 nm line of an Ar + laser was used for excitation. The as-grown CNTs were scraped off from the nickel substrates and then milled into powder. The milled CNTs powder was mixed with ethylcellulose and terpineol, and then sufficiently stirred in an agate bowl for about 1 h to make the nanotubes homogeneously dispersed in the organic materials. After that, the CNTs slurry was screen printed through a mesh on the glass substrate, which had already been coated with a silver conducting layer by screen-printing process. After exposure to air at room temperature for about 20 min, the substrate was put into 200 \u00b0C sinter furnace to remove the organic binders in the paste. The CNTs film cathode was finally formed after heated at 550 \u00b0C in hydrogen for 15 min. The effect of growth temperature on the production of CNTs was studied in this work. When growth temperature varied from 500 \u00b0C to 750 \u00b0C at intervals of 50 \u00b0C maintaining the C 2 H 2 /H 2 flow rate at 50/200 sccm and gas pressure at 20 kPa, variable amounts of CNTs were obtained. The emission current\u2013voltage characteristics of screen-printed CNTs cathodes were measured in a vacuum chamber with a parallel diode-type configuration at 10 \u22125 Pa at room temperature ( Fig. 1 ). An anode of indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass was separated from the as-made CNTs film cathode by glass spacer with the thickness of 340 \u03bcm. The measured emission area was 4.0 cm 2 . An ITO glass with a phosphor layer fabricated by screen-printing process was then used as the anode to observe the distribution and density of the field emission. 3 Results 3.1 CNTs morphological features 3.1.1 Scanning electron microscope (SEM) Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the MWCNTs fabricated by CVD method at different growth temperatures (500\u2013750 \u00b0C). CNTs are all randomly distributed with different morphologies. The thickness of the grown CNTs film on the Ni substrates ranges from about 2 mm to 6 mm. Thinner CNTs film is synthesized at higher temperature. The diameter of the CNTs grown at 500 \u00b0C is in the range of 150 nm \u00b1 50 nm, some amorphous carbon included ( Fig. 2 a). With the temperature increased to 600 \u00b0C, the average diameter of CNTs decreases to 75 nm \u00b1 25 nm, and amorphous carbon phase decreased. When the temperature reaches 700 \u00b0C or 750 \u00b0C, the diameter of CNTs becomes 40 nm \u00b1 10 nm and purity further increases as shown in Fig. 2 e and f. After milling process, the CNTs become slightly shorter and more uniform in length. A typical morphology of the CNTs grown at 650 \u00b0C after milling is shown in Fig. 2 g, looking more uniform comparing with the as-grown CNTs ( Fig. 2 d). After screen-printing process, the CNTs are randomly distributed in the inorganic matrix, the morphology is similar except the density is lower as shown in Fig. 2 h. The same results are founded for the other growth temperatures. 3.1.2 Raman spectra Fig. 3 exhibits the Raman spectra of the CNTs grown at different temperatures. The peaks imply that CNTs are characteristic of graphite. Two peaks were located at approximately 1350 cm \u22121 and 1580 cm \u22121 respectively in the spectra showing the typical graphite structure features [26,27] . The first-order Raman spectrum of CNTs shows strong sharp peaks at \u223c1580 cm \u22121 , which is identified as the G peak of crystalline graphite arising from zone-center E 2 g mode and \u223c1350 cm \u22121 (roughly corresponding to the D-line associated with disorder-allowed zone-edge modes of graphite). The 1350 cm \u22121 band is normally explained by relaxation of the wave vector selection rule, due to the effect of the finite size of the crystal in the material. Normally, the intensity of the 1350 cm \u22121 peak increases (i) with an increase in the amount of disordered carbon in the samples and (ii) with a decrease in the graphite crystal size. Fig. 3 a presents that as the temperature increases the G peak becomes stronger and sharper, implying that the diameters of CNTs decrease when the temperature is increased from 500 \u00b0C to 750 \u00b0C, which is consistent with the SEM results ( Fig. 2 ). In Fig. 3 b, it is found that the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of D peak and G peak decreases with increasing growth temperature, showing the graphitization of CNTs enhances. The G peak position shifts from \u223c1590 cm \u22121 (500 \u00b0C) to \u223c1568 cm \u22121 (750 \u00b0C), which indicates decreasing of the diameter size of CNTs and better graphite structure at higher growth temperatures. The intensity ratio of G and D bands ( I (D)/ I (G)) decreases from 1.05 to 0.95 with increasing the growth temperature. The result are consistent with the crystallinity of graphitic sheets improves progressively as the growth temperature increases. This phenomenon corresponds to the previous SEM results. 3.2 FE characteristics 3.2.1 I \u2013 V curve The current\u2013electric field ( I - F ) plot and corresponding Fowler\u2013Nordheim (F\u2013N) of the CNTs cathode plot shown in Fig. 4 a, indicating the field emission characteristics of CNTs grown at different temperatures. In all the curves, the current increases exponentially when the field is low (i.e. E < 3.10 V/\u03bcm at 600 \u00b0C). However, the current at high field (i.e. E > 3.10 V/\u03bcm at 600 \u00b0C) is limited by the resistivity or the absorbated states of CNT cathode to close to a saturation state. All the curves are smooth and emission current changes rapidly when applied field increases from 0.5 V/\u03bcm to 3.0 V/\u03bcm for 700\u2013750 \u00b0C CNTs. The gradient of the curve of 500\u2013550 \u00b0C CNTs is smaller than those of higher temperatures (600\u2013650 \u00b0C), and 750 \u00b0C CNTs has the largest slope. From the insert F\u2013N plots in Fig. 4 a, we observe F\u2013N behavior (1) I \u221d aF 2 exp ( - b / F ) where a and b are constant and F 2 is the electrical field strength at emitting point. In order to compare the detail properties of field emission, Fig. 4 b shows the turn-on electric field (Eon) (here the emission current defined at 1 \u03bcA) of different temperatures grown CNTs. It can be seen that the higher the temperature is, the lower the Eon is. When the temperature decreases from 750 \u00b0C to 500 \u00b0C, Eon increases nearly by three times from 0.58 V/\u03bcm to 2.20 V/\u03bcm. Fig. 4 c shows emission currents of different CNTs at the same applied field (2.5 V/\u03bcm). With the temperature rising, the emission current increases rapidly from a few microampere (5 \u03bcA) at 500 \u00b0C to hundreds of microampere (333.3 \u03bcA) at 750 \u00b0C. 3.2.2 Luminescence spots From the measurement of luminescence of the phosphor on the anode, the uniformity and density of the emission sites can be deduced. Fig. 5 shows the luminescence images of the field emission of the screen-printed CNTs film grown at different temperatures. The images on the anode plate show the spacial distribution of emission sites. At low temperatures, there are a few electron emission sites ( Fig. 5 a and b). When the growth temperature is increased, more and more sites take part in emission ( Fig. 5 c\u2013f). At the same applied electric field of 2.65 V/\u03bcm, emission current density is only 5.75 \u03bcA/cm 2 for 500 \u00b0C grown CNTs, 77.25 \u03bcA/cm 2 for 600 \u00b0C grown CNTs, 101.6 \u03bcA/cm 2 at 700 \u00b0C growth temperature. With growth temperature increasing, the uniformity of field emission of screen-printed CNTs film improves greatly. For 750 \u00b0C grown CNTs, the emission sites density is the highest, lots of emitters emit electron exciting the phosphor anode which leads to uniform and compact emission images, as shown in Fig. 5 f. As shown in Fig. 5 , the luminescence spots of lower temperature grown CNTs ( Fig. 5 a and b) are bigger and less than those of higher growth temperature ( Fig. 5 e and f). That means the CNTs grown at higher temperature can produce more uniform luminescence image. All these results come to a conclusion that the higher growth temperature is, the smaller diameter of the CNTs is, and the better the FE properties are, i.e. lower turn-on emission field, higher emission current and more uniform emission. Since CNTs productive yield is low when growth temperature is above 700 \u00b0C, the optimized growth temperature for CVD method should be 600\u2013700 \u00b0C. 4 Discussion The Fowler\u2013Nordheim (F\u2013N) model of field emission dates back to the beginnings of quantum mechanics and is still widely used today [28] . Although this model has been originally developed for flat metallic surfaces at 0 K, it has proven adaptable to describe field emission from carbon-based electron emitters [24,29] . The F\u2013N model states that the current I ( A ) per emitter varies with the local field at the emitter surface F (V/m) as (2) I ( 0 ) = A 1.56 \u00d7 10 - 6 \u03d5 \u00d7 t ( y ) F 2 exp - 6.83 \u00d7 10 9 \u03d5 1.5 F v ( y ) \u03d5 : work function, \u03b3 : field emission factor, where A has the dimension of an area [m 2 ] and represents in first approximation the emitting area, \u03d5 is the work function in eV (CNTs \u223c 4.9 eV), and t ( y ) and v ( y ) are the Nordheim elliptic functions. These functions can be approximated by t ( y ) \u2248 1.1, v ( y ) \u2248 0.95 \u2212 y 2 . The local electric field is not simply V / d (applied voltage, V , divided by interelectrode distance, d ) but is higher by a factor \u03b3 , which gives the aptitude of the emitter to amplify the field and is accordingly termed the field-enhancement factor. \u03b3 is a strictly geometrical parameter that depends on the dimensions, shape of the emitter and on its surroundings, as well as on the shape and distance of the counterelectrode. The field at the emitter surface is written as (3) F = \u03b3 V / d \u03b3 can be estimated from the geometry: for nanotubes, one can use the models developed for a cylinder of height h terminated by a half sphere of radius r on a flat surface, which states that (4) \u03b3 \u2248 0.7 \u00d7 h / r The height and the radius of CNTs will directly affect its emission properties, the bigger the h is and the smaller the r is, the bigger the \u03b3 is. That means the emission current is larger. The CNTs grown at higher temperature have smaller radius as shown in Fig. 2 , which is agreed with the bigger emission current ( Fig. 4 a and c). In addition, the effect of the increased growth temperature is to increase the crystallinity of the nanotubes emitters as shown in Raman experiment. Thus improves the CNTs\u2019 conductivity and reduces the resistivity, resulting in the higher currents during the electron emission process from CNTs. Amorphous carbon has weaker emission ability and worse stability than CNTs. For its high proportion of amorphous carbon, lower temperature grown (500\u2013550 \u00b0C ) CNTs perform worse emission properties such as high turn-on electric field, low emission current, and few emission sites. 5 Conclusion In summary, the carbon nanotubes have been grown on nickel substrate by chemical vapor deposition at different temperatures, and the CNTs film field emission cathode is fabricated by screen-printing method. With the temperature increasing from 500 \u00b0C to 750 \u00b0C, the diameter of CNTs becomes smaller and the purity increases. Whilst, the field emission properties of the screen-printed CNTs cathodes become better, i.e. lower turn-on emission field (from 2.20 V/\u03bcm to 0.58 V/\u03bcm), higher emission current (from 5 \u03bcA to 333.3 \u03bcA) and more luminescence spots density. The experiment shows there is an optimal growth temperature range (600\u2013700 \u00b0C) for CNTs to be used for field emission cathode fabrication regarding the CNTs production yield and field emission properties.

Growing carbon nanotubes on glass substrate surface requires the formation of high-density catalyst nanoparticles. This, in turn, requires the minimum diffusion of catalyst into the substrate at the growth temperature for carbon nanotubes. In this work, four metals (W, Ni, Cr and Ti) as the diffusion barrier have been optimized and examined for growing carbon nanotubes on glass substrate.

The growth rate of CNTs increased first with temperature increase from 500\u00b0C, and reached a maximal value at 650\u00b0C, then decreased when the temperature increased further. The morphologies and structures of deposited CNTs were characterized by scanning electron microscope and Raman spectroscopy. The diameter, length, uniformity and crystallinity of the deposited CNT also showed a temperature dependence. The field emission properties of the CNTs were tested, the field emission principle was studied deeply, and the results proved the temperature dependence of CNTs properties and the existence of optimization of temperature. The experimental result indicated that the morphology, structure and field emission properties of CNTs could be controlled by the reaction temperature in a certain range.",

The catalytic films were pre-patterned using screen-printing method, combined with filtered cathodic vacuum arc or ion beam sputtering. The effect of different catalysts on the CNT growth and field emission were investigated. For samples catalyzed with a-C:Co, Ni-Cu or Cu, no CNTs are formed, and they show no field emission below the applied field of 4.4 V/\u03bcm. For samples catalyzed with Ni-Fe or Ni-Cr, large amounts of entangled CNTs are successfully obtained and exhibit good electron emission, having a turn-on field as low as 2.5 V/\u03bcm. The process, due to its simplicity and relatively low growth temperature, is promising for practical application in field emission display.",

The emission characteristics of the CNTs film cathodes have as good properties as those by screen printing and better emission uniformity. The influence of the voltage between electrodes in the electrophoretic process of flat cold cathode fabrication on the uniformity of the CNTs film distribution was studied.

The azobenzene in hybrid films can undergo trans-cis-trans photoisomerization efficiently by a photoirradiation with UV light. It is also found interestingly that surface relief patterns can be heat-induced on such azobenzene-containing small molecular hybrid films, but can be erased by further heating the hybrid film and no permanent damage of the hybrid film is observed. The refractive index, thickness, and morphologic properties of the hybrid films have also been investigated by a prism coupling technique and atomic force microscopy. These results indicate that the azodye-doped hybrid films are promising candidates for integrated optics and photonic applications, which allow directly integrating on the same chip waveguide device with the optical data storage and optical switching devices. \u00a9 2007 Optical Society of America.",

        "abstract": "Growth of carbon nanotube (CNT) films with good field emission properties on glass is very important for low cost field emission\n display (FED) applications. In addition to Ni, Co and Fe, Cu can be a good catalyst for CNT growth on glass, but due to diffusion\n into SiO2 it is difficult to control the CNTs density and uniformity. In this paper, four metal barrier layers (W, Ni, Cr, Ti) were\n deposited by dc magnetron sputtering on glass to reduce the Cu diffusion. As-grown CNT films showed various morphologies with\n the use of different barrier metals. CNTs with uniform distribution and better crystallinity can be synthesized only on Ti/Cu\n and W/Cu. Voltage current measurements indicate that better field emission properties of CNT films can be obtained on titanium\n and tungsten barriered Cu, while chromium and nickel are not suitable barrier candidates for copper in CNT-FED applications\n because of the reduced emission performance.",

        "abstract": "Nd3+ -doped GeO2/ormosil transparent dried gel with the molar composition of 30GeO2-70ormosil-0.5Nd22O 3 was prepared by a sol-gel process from an organic-inorganic hybrid system at a low temperature of 100\u00b0C. Acid-catalyzed solutions of \u03b3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane mixed with gemanium isopropoxide were used as matrix precursors. In this organic-inorganic hybrid transparent dried gel, a relative strong room-temperature photoluminescence emission at 1062 nm corresponding to the 4F3/2 \u2192 4I 11/2 transition of neodymium ion was measured. An intense room temperature yellow to violet upconversion emission at 398 nm was observed under a xenon lamp excitation with a yellow light at the wavelength of 580 nm, in addition to this intense violet emission, an ultraviolet emission at 345 nm and a blue emission at 470 nm were also observed. The emission mechanism is proposed, and it indicates that excited-state absorption process originating from the long-lived 4F3/2 excited state should be responsible for upconversion process.",

        "abstract": "Carbon nanotubes field emission display (CNTs-FED) has been regarded as the most promising flat panel display due to its high definition, low power consumption, high brightness, fast response time, wide work temperature range and low cost. As the key material, the properties of CNTs will affect FED characters directly. CNTs with good field emission properties were needed for the FED. The CNTs were synthesized by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) in the temperature range of 500 \u2103 ~750 \u2103. The morphologies of CNTs depending on growth temperatures were characterized by scanning electron microscope. The as-grown CNTs were mixed with conductive pastes, then screen-printed on the glass substrate coated with a silver conducting layer to form a FED cathode. The dependence of FED properties on the CNTs growth temperatures was studied by using current-voltage (I-V) and luminescence image measurements. The SEM images shew that with the temperature increasing from 500 \u2103 to 700 \u2103, the average diameter of CNTs decreased. By the I-V and luminescence image measurements, it was found that the higher growth temperature, the better FED properties, i.e. lower turn-on emission field , higher emission current and more uniform emission.The field emission experiment of the CNTs cathodes indicated that there is an optimal temperature range (600~700 \u2103) for CNTs growth and being used as field emission cathode. With good pro- perties , bright and stable anode image was observed in diode mode field emission. These results suggested that CVD grown CNTs could be used for cathode fabrication of large area field emission display.",

        "abstract": "On 19 February 2013, the first patient infected with a novel influenza A H7N9 virus from an avian source showed symptoms of sickness. More than 349 laboratory-confirmed cases and 109 deaths have been reported in mainland China since then. Laboratory-confirmed, human-to-human H7N9 virus transmission has not been documented between individuals having close contact; however, this transmission route could not be excluded for three families. To control the spread of the avian influenza H7N9 virus, we must better understand its pathogenesis, transmissibility, and transmission routes in mammals. Studies have shown that this particular virus is transmitted by aerosols among ferrets.To study potential transmission routes in animals with direct or close contact to other animals, we investigated these factors in a murine model.Viable H7N9 avian influenza virus was detected in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, intestine, and brain of model mice. The virus was transmissible between mice in close contact, with a higher concentration of virus found in pharyngeal and ocular secretions, and feces. All these biological materials were contagious for na\u00efve mice.Our results suggest that the possible transmission routes for the H7N9 influenza virus were through mucosal secretions and feces.",

Laboratory mice have been reported to be susceptible to SFTSV infection, but the infection in nonhuman primates has not been investigated. This study is the first to report that, in rhesus macaques, SFTSV does not cause severe symptoms or death but causes fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and increased levels of transaminases and myocardial enzymes in blood. Viremia, virus-specific immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibodies, and neutralizing antibodies were identified in all infected macaques. Levels of the cytokines interferon \u03b3, eotaxin, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b2 were significantly elevated in the blood. Minor pathological lesions were observed in the liver and kidney during the late stages of infection. Overall, SFTSV infection in rhesus macaques resembled mild SFTS in humans.",

        "abstract": "Objective To propagate SHIV1157ipd3N4 virus stock via passages in Chinese-origin monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PMBCs).Methods The PBMCs from Chinese-origin rhesus macaque were cocultured with SHIV1157ipd3N4,a CCR5-tropic chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus(SHIV) strain.The level of P24 antigen in the supernatant was tested continuously.The virus stock was collected when the viral duplication reached a peak.The env gene of SHIV1157ipd3N4 was analyzed,and the viral load,P24 antigen level and TCID50were determined.The rhesus monkey G1004V was infected with this batch of SHIV1157ipd3N4 intravenously.The viral load in plasma and the changes of CD4 +/ CD8 + ratio were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR and flow cytometry.Results Totally 243 mL virus stock was propagated in monkeys PBMCs.The viral load was 1.586 \u00d7 108 copies/mL,the level of P24 antigen was 1.16 \u00d7 103 pg/mL and had 3.16 \u00d7 103 50% tissue culture infective dose(TCID50) in 1 mL of cell-free SHIV1157ipd3N4.There was no variation in the gp120 sequence of env gene and this SHIV1157ipd3N4 stock was still exclusively CCR5-tropic.The monkey G1004V was infected and had a high level of viral loads in plasma.Conclusion This panel of pathogenic R5-tropic SHIV1-157ipd3N4 was adapted in Chinese-origin rhesus monkeys PBMCs,and is stable and suitable to serve as an animal model.",

        "abstract": "Objective To study the expression of death receptor(CD95) on the surface of peripheral blood CD4+T cells and the CD4+ T cell numbers during the acute phase in SIVmac239 virus-infected rhesus monkeys challenged by rectal(rectal infection: IR) and intravenous(intravenous infection: IV) routes,respectively.Methods Fourteen rhesus monkeys were challenged with SIVmac239 intrarectally or intravenously.Infection was determined by monitoring the viral load,CD4+T lymphocyte number and CD4+/CD8 + ratio.Flow cytometry analysis was used to assess the CD95 expression on the surface of CD4+ T cells at nine time points during the acute-phase infection.Results In the intravenous infection group,CD95 expression on the CD4+T cells began to increase on the next day after infection,and reached the peak value on the 7th day,meanwhile the CD4+T lymphocyte number was declined to the lowest point.In the rectal infection group it also began to rise on the following day after infection and the CD95 expression reached the peak value at 10 days after infection,but the number of CD4+T cells was reduced to the lowest point until the 17th day.Compared with the intravenous infection,the peak value of CD95 expression and the lowest point of CD4+T cell number appeared later in the IR group,and the peak value of CD95 expression occurred a week earlier to the lowest point of CD4+T cells.Conclusions CD95 expression of the CD4+T cells is increased and the amount of CD4+T cells is decreased in SIVmac 239-infected rhesus monkeys challenged intrarectally or intravenously.Our results show that CD95 expressed on the surface of CD4+T cells vary in the SIVmac 239-infected rhesus monkeys.It may be due to the different effects of CD95 during the acute phase infection induced by different routes.",

        "abstract": "A possible mechanism of susceptibility to superinfection with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-1157ipd3N4 was explored in twelve SHIVSF162P3-infected Chinese rhesus macaques. Based on the kinetics of viral replication for the second infecting virus following SHIV-1157ipd3N4 inoculation, the monkeys were divided into two groups: those relatively resistant to superinfection (SIR) and those relatively sensitive to superinfection (SIS). We found that superinfection-resistant macaques had high primary viremia, whereas superinfection-sensitive macaques had low primary viremia, suggesting that primary SHIVSF162P3 infection with a high viral-replication level would repress superinfection with a heterologous SHIV-1157ipd3N4. Although no correlation of protection against superinfection with virus-specific CD4(+) T cell or CD8(+) T cell immune responses from gut was observed prior to superinfection, superinfection susceptibility was strongly correlated with CD4(+) Tcm cells from gut both prior to the second infecting virus inoculation and on day 7 after superinfection, but not with CD4(+) Tem cells from gut or with CD4(+) Tcm cells from peripheral blood and lymph node. These results point to the important roles of gut-derived CD4(+) Tcm cells for the study of the mechanisms of protection against superinfection and the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of vaccines and therapies against acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).",

Experiment of 2560km error-free transmission in straight line without forward error correction (FEC) and electric regeneration was demonstrated in this paper to evaluate the performance of modified CSRZ, and chirped fiber Bragg grating (CFBG) employed as the dispersion compensator in this transmission system. The experiment result showed that if the modified CSRZ format was applied in this 2560km transmission, less than 2.5dB power penalty was cost after 2560km transmission, and on the other hand, error-free transmission could not be got in the conventional NRZ-based CFBG-compensated system.",

Using dispersion compensation\n CFBG, a 2500 km-10 Gbps RZ optical signal transmission system on G.652 fiber was successfully demonstrated without an electric\n regenerator by optimizing dispersion management and loss management. The RZ optical signal was generated through a two-stage\n modulation method. At 2081 km, the power penalty of transmission is about 3 dB (conditions: RZ signal, BER = 10\u221212, PRBS = 1023 \u2212 1); At 2560 km, the power penalty is about 5 dB. It is superior to the system using NRZ under the same conditions.",

The influence of these nonideal characteristics on the CFBG-based transmission systems with carrier suppressed return-to-zero (CSRZ) format was investigated, and the performance of the transmission system was evaluated by the eye opening penalty (EOP) in this paper. In additional, the impact of the phase difference between the central wavelength of the transmitted signal and the GDR on the transmission system which make the transmission performance fluctuate randomly was also studied. The analysis helps to conduct a practical 10Gb/s 2560km error-free transmission experiment in straight line with low power penalty, and no electronics regenerator and forward error correction (FEC) were employed in this system. The experiment result is so attractive in long haul transmission field.",

Asymmetric apodization is one of the powerful measures to improve the quality of gratings. Wavelength-dependent transmission performance is also observed. The experimental results indicate that the total in-band local dispersion deviation of the cascaded gratings in each channel could be a good indicator of the performance degradation tendency at different operating wavelengths, which further reveals the potential of local dispersion deviation as a performance evaluating indicator of chirped FBGs. \u00a9 2005 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "To observe the effect of different moxibustion intervention on expression of interleukin-1 (IL-l) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the synovial fluid of hind-knee joint in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) rabbits.Forty Japanese big-ear white rabbits (half male and half female) were randomized into normal control, RA model, direct-moxibustion, ginger-partitioned moxibustion and warm moxibustion groups (n= 8). RA model was established by injection of Freund's Complete Adjuvant (0. 5 mL/kg) into the articular cavities of the rabbits' bilateral hind-limbs. Moxibustion intervention was applied to unilateral \"Shenshu\" (BL 23) and \"Zusanli\"(ST 36) regions alternatively for 20 min from the 7th day on after modeling, once daily for 3 weeks except Sundays. The circumference of the hindlimb-knee joint was measured using a tape measure and the contents of IL-1 and TNF-alpha in the synovial fluid of articular cavities were detected by ELISA.In comparison with the normal control group, the circumference values of the bilateral hind-knee joints, and the contents of IL-1 and TNF-alpha in the synovial fluid of articular cavities in the model group were significantly increased (P<0. 01). After the moxibustion treatment, compared with the model group, the circumference values of the bilateral hind-knee joints, and IL-1 and TNF-alpha contents of the synovial fluid in the warm moxibustion, direct moxibustion and ginger-partitioned moxibustion groups were remarkably reduced (P<0.01, P<0.05). The effects of the ginger-partitioned group were significantly superior to those of both warm moxibustion and direct moxibustion groups in decreasing the swelled hind-knee joint circumference on day 21 after the treatment and down-regulating synovial fluid inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF-alpha levels (P<0. 05).Warm, direct and ginger-separated moxibustion interventions all can reduce inflammatory reactions of the knee-joint and suppress inflammatory cytokine IL-1 and TNF-alpha levels of the synovial fluid in RA rabbits, which may contribute to its effect in improving RA in clinic. The therapeutic effect of ginger-partitioned muxibustion intervention is apparently better.",

Under the physiological state, EMG was detected on the frontal muscle, zygomatic muscle and orbicular muscle before and after acupuncture at different acupoints. The impacts of acupuncture on the facial EMG were studied and compared among different acupoints.With acupuncture at \"Hegu\" (LI 4), the latency was reduced (P < 0.01) and the peak value and area were increased (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) in the frontal EMG; the area and the peak value were increased (P < 0.01, P < 0.05) and latency was reduced (P < 0.05) in the zygomatic EMG; the frequency was increased (P < 0.01) and the latency was reduced (P < 0.05) in the orbicular EMG. Before and after acupuncture at \"Hegu\" (LI 4), the change rates of EMG frequency, peak value, area and latency on the frontal, zygomatic and orbicular muscles were higher than those at \"Houxi\" (SI 3) and \"Waiguan\" (TE 5) (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) separately.The relative specificity presents between Hegu (LI 4) and facial muscular movement.",

        "abstract": "To observe the effect of moxibustion of \"Shenshu\" (BL 23) and \"Zusanli\"(ST 36) on synovial nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB p65 expression, and plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and serum cortisol (CS) contents in rheumatic arthritis (RA) rats with adrenalectomy (ADX) so as to study the underlying mechanism in ameliorating RA.Fifty male SD rats were randomly divided into control (n=10), model (n=10), moxibustion (n=10), ADX (n=10) and false ADX (n=10) groups according to SPSS-aided random digits table. RA model was established by injecting 0.1 mL Freund's complete adjuvant into the right paw. ADX operation was performed on the sixth day after successful establishment of RA model. Moxibustion was given to \"Shenshu\" (BL 23) and \"Zusanli\" (ST 36) from the 7th day on, five moxa cones each session, and once daily for 18 days. Then plasma ACTH and serum CS contents, for which the blood was collected during night, were detected by ELISA, and NF-kappaB p 65 immunoactivity in synovial tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry.In comparison with control group, the foot volumes (swelling degree) of model, moxibustion, ADX, and false ADX groups increased significantly (P < 0.01), while compared with model group, the swelling degrees of moxibustion and false ADX groups were decreased remarkably after the treatment (P < 0.01). No significant difference was found between ADX and model groups in the foot volume (P > 0.05). Compared with control group, plasma ACTH content in RA model group decreased obviously (P < 0.05), while serum CS level and NF-kappaB p 65 immunoactivity increased apparently in model group (P < 0.01). Compared with model group, serum CS contents in moxibustion, ADX and false ADX groups and synovial NF-kappaB p 65 immunoactivity in moxibustion and false ADX groups reduced considerably (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). No significant difference was found between ADX and model groups in synovial NF-kappaB p 65 immunoactivity (P > 0.05).Moxibustion treatment can reduce inflammation reactions in RA rats, which is closely associated with its effects in upregulating plasma ACTH, downregulaing serum CS level and synovial NF-kappaB p 65 immunoactivity, and the intact hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA).",

        "abstract": "Objective The present paper is designed to study whether the heparanase eptitopes elicit heparanase-specific CTL against various tumors in vitro and provide theoretical evidence for their clinical application.Methods Dendritic cells(DCs) were pulsed with five HLA-A2-restricted epitopes of heparanase respectively to induce heparanase-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTLs).Specific lysis to various tumor cell lines was examined by a 4 h standard 51 Cr release assay.The IFN-\u03b3 releasing of effector cells was tested by ELISPOT.Results Of the five epitopes of heparanase,only Hpa(525-533),Hpa(277-285) and Hpa(405-413) could elicit potent specific lysis to KATO-\u2162,U2OS and SW480 cells which were heparanase and HLA-A2 positive.Effector induced by the above epitopes could not only lyse MCF-7 cells,which was heparanase negative,But also lyse as HepG2 cells,which was HLA-A2 negaive.But the specific lysis reoccurred after MCF-7 cells transduced with a plasmid contained full-length cDNA of heparanase or HepG2 cells transduced with a plasmid contained full-length cDNA of HLA-A2.Futher study demonstrated these heparanase-specific effectors induced by the above epitopes could not lyse autologous lymphocytes.In addition,we also found that Hpa(525-533),Hpa(277-285) and Hpa(405-413) heparanase epitopes could increase IFN-\u03b3 releasing of effectors.Conclusions The above studies show for the first time that the heparanase epitopes Hpa(525-533),Hpa(277-285) and Hpa(405-413) are capable of eliciting a specific anti-tumor immune response by heparanase-specific CTLs,as well as a non-specific anti-tumor immune response by enhancing cytokines releasing.These findings show that heparanase epitope vaccines have various advantages such as broad-spectrum,high-effect,high specificity and safety,which will provide theoretical evidence for their clinical application.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To explore the feasibility of heparinase vaccine in active immunity for gastric cancer. Methods: Dendritic cells originated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of healthy HLA-A2 positive donors were transfected with recombinant adenovirus containing heparinase full length cDNA of heparanase to generate heparanase gene modified DC vaccine. T lymphocytes from the same donors were activated by those genetically modified DC vaccine repeatedly to generate heparanase specific cytotoxicity T lymphocytes (CTL). CTL-mediated cell lysis to gastric cancer cells of the lines KATO-III and SGC-7901 was analyzed in vitro by standard 51Cr releasing assay. Heparinse specific CTL were co-cultured with KATO-III and SGC-7901 cells, and then ELISA was used to detect the IFN-\u03b3 release. Results: Expression of heparanase was significantly increased in the DCs transfected with heparinase recombinant adenovirus. Heparanase specific CTL generated from the genetically modified DC vaccine exhibited potent lysis to the KATO-III gastric cancer cells positive in both heparinase and HLA-A2 at each E/T ratio, whereas, these heparinase specific CTL could not lyse the SGC-7901 cells positive to heparinase but negative to HLA-A2, with a specific lysis rate of only 11.1% \u00b1 4.6% even at an E: T ratio of 40: 1. Further study showed that heparanase vaccination had no detectable lysis on the autologous lymphocytes in vitro with a specific lysis rate of only 11.4% \u00b1 7.9% even at an E: T ratio of 40: 1. The IFN-\u03b3 release amount when the heparanase specific CTL were co-cultured with the KATO-III cells was 280.4 pg/ml \u00b1 23.5 pg/ml, significantly higher than that when the heparanase specific CTL were co-cultured with the rAd5-Lacz modified DC (120.6 pg/ml \u00b1 18.9 pg/ml), and that of the IL-2 stimulated T cells (60.0 pg/ml \u00b1 10.6 pg/ml, both P < 0.05). In contrast the IFN-\u03b3 release amounts of the SGC-7901 cells and autologous lymphocytes remained unchanged when they were co-cultured with either above-mentioned effector cells (both P > 0.05). Conclusion: DC genetically modified by heparanase gene activate heparanase specific CTL and induce potent immune response against HLA-matched and heparinase positive gastric cancer cells in vitro, whereas they have no killing effect on autologous lymphocytes. Heparanase is an effective and safe target for immunogene therapy of tumor, thus providing a new biotherapy method for advanced gastric cancer.",

        "abstract": "Objective To screen and identify the efficient heparanase (Hpa) RNAi sequence. Methods We chose three candidate targets of Hpa RNAi through online software and designed a set of independent sequence as negative control group. The three interference fragments and independent sequence were cloned into pGenesile-1 expression vector by gene recombination technique. The recombinant vectors were then transfected into HepG2 liver cancer cell line. After screening by G418, the expression of heparanase in the selected clones was detected by Western blot, and its mRNA expression level by RT-PCR. Results The three interference sequences designed with online tool respectively was Hpa/RNAi-1: GGCTATCTCTTCTGTTCAA; Hpa/RNAi-2: TCCTGTCCGTCACCATTGA; Hpa/RNAi-3: CTCAGTTGCTCCTGGACTA and negative control Hpa/RNAi-N:CTACCGTTGTATAGGTGT; The three interference sequence were cloned into pGenesil-1 vector, respectively. Sequencing analysis confirmed their correctness. Positive clones formed after their stable transfection into HepG2 and G418 screening. Compared with untransfected HepG2 and negative control, Western blot analysis showed heparanase protein in interference sequence transfected HepG2 was significantly down-regulated. Hpa/RNAi-1 and Hpa/RNAi-3 showed better inhibition effect, with their inhibition efficiency to 57% and 71% respectively; RT-PCR result proved the sequence of Hpa/RNAi-1 and Hpa/RNAi-3 could effectively down-regulate heparanase on mRNA level. Conclusion We successfully screen and identify the efficient heparanase RNAi sequence.",

The strain was identified as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia based on BioMerieux Vitek system and the analysis of 16S rDNA sequence. Mass spectrometry of the product extracted with an organic solvent and re-crystallization gave m/z value of 272 for the molecular ion while 256 for substrate IMI. It demonstrated that the transformed product was the hydroxylated derivate of IMI or hydroxy IMI. NMR analysis further indicated that the hydroxyl moiety located at the ring of imidazolidine and the transformed product was 5-hydroxy IMI. Kinetics of transformation IMI showed that the content of IMI decreased 1.15 mmol/L and the content of transformed product 5-hydroxy IMI increased 1.10 mmol/L after transformation for 10 days. The molar conversion yield was 95.9%. The S. maltophilia NJ2 strain, with the characterization of strong transformation ability and high molar conversion yield, can be used in industrial production of 5-hydroxy IMI for synthesis of highly insecticidal olefin IMI.",

Here it was reported that non-degradation of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid during hydroxylation of nicotinic acid by resting cells was due to existing of nicotinic acid in the transformation mixture, not the death of cells. Therefore it was attempted that the induced cultivation of Pseudomonas putida NA-1 for hydroxylation activity by nicotinic acid was used for accumulation of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid to establish a new technology, a combined technology of growing culture transformation and resting cells transformation. In the combination technology, when 1% of nicotinic acid was kept in cultivation medium by supplement of nicotinic acid at intervals during cultivation of Pseudomonas putida NA-1, the growing culture could consistently hydroxylate nicotinic acid without degradation of its product which was accumulated linearly in the cultivation medium with progress of cultivation; the resting cells obtained from cultivation broth after growing culture transformation still processed a very high hydroxylation activity and could be used to next resting transformation of nicotinic acid. By using of the combined technology, the inducer was saved and the production yield of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid increased above 65%.",

        "abstract": "A high performance liquid chromatographic(HPLC) method using on-line photochemical derivatization and fluorescence detection was developed for the simultaneous determination of nicotinic acid(NIA),nicotinamide(NIC),thiamine hydrochloride(B1),riboflavin(B2) and cyanocobalamin(B12).A self-built time/energy programmed photochemical reactor(PCR) with an ultraviolet mercury lamp was installed between the diode-array detector(DAD) and fluorescence detector(FLD) to convert the non-or weakly fluorescent vitamins into fluorescence compounds.The separation of NIA,NIC,B1,B12 and B2 was achieved within 12 min using 0.05 mol/L phosphate buffer(pH 5.8)-0.018 mol/L triethylamine-0.002 mol/L sodium heptane sulfonate(A) and methanol(B) as mobile phase by isocratic elution(A\u2236B,85\u223615).The separation and photochemical derivatization conditions were optimized.Under the optimal conditions,the calibration curves of five vitamins were linear in the range of 0.1-10.0 mg/L for NIA and NIC,0.2-20.0 mg/L for B1 and B12,0.01-1.0 mg/L for B2 with correlation coefficient(r) more than 0.996.The limits of detection(LOD,3\u03c3) ranged from 1.5 \u03bcg/L to 25.4 \u03bcg/L and the limits of quantitation(LOQs,10\u03c3) were 5.0-84.7 \u03bcg/L,which were better than those of the traditional HPLC/DAD method.The relative standard deviations(RSDs,n=7) were not more than 7.8% and the spiked recoveries were between 98% and 103%.The developed method was successfully applied in the determination of vitamins NIC,B1 and B2 in multivitamin tablets.",

This intervention study was designed to evaluate the effects of non-surgical periodontal therapy on the clinical response and systemic status of ESRD patients.Patients in the intervention group (n = 48) received non-surgical periodontal therapy and then a supragingival prophylaxis at the 3-month follow up, and those in the control group (n = 49) received no intervention throughout the study. At 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after therapy, clinical periodontal examinations were conducted and blood samples were taken to evaluate inflammatory, nutritional and lipid profiles.The results showed a significant improvement in clinical periodontal parameters (p < 0.05) in the intervention group. Compared to the control group, the intervention group had significantly lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein at 3 months and 6 months. Significant improvements were found (p < 0.05) in interleukin-6, ferritin, albumin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and transferrin after therapy.Non-surgical periodontal therapy can effectively improve periodontal, circulating inflammatory and nutritional status in ESRD patients. Non-surgical periodontal therapy, as a relatively simple intervention, has beneficial systemic effects in ESRD patients.",

        "abstract": "Objective To compare the clinical effectiveness of a combination therapy consisting of bovine porous bone mineral(Bio-oss) and the regenerative Bio-gide collagen membrane in the regeneration of periodontal intrabony defects in humans.Methods Forty-five intrabony defects of furcation involvement were divided into 3 groups and treated with Bio-oss(GBR),Bio-oss and Bio-gide(GTR),open-flap debridement(OFD),respectively.Clinical parameters evaluated included changes in attachment loss(AL),pocket depth(PD),gingival index(GI),tooth mobility(TM),and the bone loss of the alveolar process was observed on radiograms preoperatively and repeated at the 3rd,6th and 12th months postoperatively.Results At the 3rd month postoperatively,three groups showed more reduction in GI,PD and AL than preoperatively(P<0.01),PD,AL in group GBR and group GTR were significantly lower than those in group OFD,and the radiographic appearance suggested osseous fill and bone density increased.At the 6th and 12th months after operation,there were significant differences of PD and AL between group GBR or group GTR and group OFD,and the TM in group GBR and group GTR significantly decreased,compared with those before operation.The decreases of PD and AL in group GTR were significantly more than those in group GBR(P<0.01),and there were significant differences of TM between group GBR and group GTR.No significant difference in GI reduction was observed between each group.The osseous fill and bone density significantly increased in group GBR or group GTR than preoperatively,and the osseous fill increased more in group GTR than that in group GBR.Conclusion This study demonstrates that Bio-oss and Bio-gide used have the capacity to stimulate substantial new bone formation and improve the clinical indices and these capacity is further increased when the graft is used with a slowly resorbing collagen membrane to treat bone loss of furcation involvement of periodontitis,and these effects can last more than 1 year.",

        "abstract": "Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is a skeletal dysplasia with autosomal-dominant inheritance. The runt related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) gene is the only gene in which mutations are known to cause CCD. We report identification of a novel small deletions mutation in the RUNX2 gene in a Chinese family with CCD. A 29-year-old female was diagnosed as proband of CCD based on the clinical findings, which show delayed closure of the fontanels, hypoplastic or aplastic clavicles and dental anomalies. Similar dental and skeletal symptoms were also observed in the other three affected individuals. We prepared genomic DNA from all four affected individuals, unaffected individual from her family members, as well as 100 unrelated healthy controls. PCR was conducted using the above genomic DNA as template and the RUNX2 gene-specific primers. The PCR product was subjected to direct sequencing and the sequence was compared to that of RUNX2 gene within the NCBI database. We detected a small deletion CCTA from nucleotide 635 to nucleotide 638 in exon 3 of RUNX2 gene of the proband. This will lead to the introduction of a translational stop codon at codon 220, resulting in a truncated RUNX2 protein, and therefore within the runt domain of the RUNX2 protein. We detected the same mutation in the the other three affected individuals, and did not detect any mutation in the unaffected family members or the 100 unrelated healthy controls, demonstrating that this is a novel missense mutation in RUNX2 gene and therefore, contributes to the molecular diagnosis of CCD.",

        "abstract": "Background: Exogenous tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 combined with chemotherapy against cancer was more effective than either single agent alone, which provides a new direction of tumor therapy. Aims: To transfect TNF-\u03b1 gene into human hepatoma transplantation tumor model by Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 in nude mice, and to study the inhibitory effect and mechanism. Methods: Eukaryotic expression plasmid pSVK3-TNF-\u03b1 was transfected into human hepatoma cell line SMMC-7721 and subcutaneous nodules of SMMC-7721 cell transplantation tumor by Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 in nude mice. Level of TNF-\u03b1 in SMMC-7721 cells was detected. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) method was used to detect the death rate. Flow cytometry and TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) were used to assess the cell cycle and apoptosis, respectively. Results: On the fifth day after TNF-\u03b1 gene transfected into human hepatoma transplantation tumor, the tumor size was (75.28\u00b135.35) mm3, significantly lower than that in control group [(326.45\u00b1103.64) mm3] (P< 0.05). At 24, 48, 72 hours after TNF-\u03b1 gene transfected into SMMC-7721 cells, the expression of TNF-\u03b1 gene in gene transfection group was (1680\u00b1187) pg, (1702\u00b1205) pg and (1650\u00b1164) pg per 10\u03b1 cells, respectively. The death rate was (37.1 \u00b12.4)%, (79.4\u00b14.3)% and (84.2\u00b14.6)%, respectively. At 72 hours after gene transfection, proliferation index of SMMC-7721 cells in gene transfection group was (30.5\u00b13.2)%, significantly lower than that in control group [(46.1\u00b13.9)%] (P<0.05). Apoptosis index of gene transfected cells was (10.0\u00b12.1)%, significantly higher than that in control group [(2.7\u00b1 0.4)%] (P<0.01). Conclusions: The TNF-\u03b1 gene transfection into human hepatoma transplantation tumor by Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 in nude mice can markedly inhibit the tumor growth, and its mechanism may be due to inhibition of tumor cell cycle and induction of cell apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "Background: Recently, some studies demonstrated that Th17 cells may be involved in the modulation of non-viral specific liver injury, however, the role of Th17 cells in liver injury of post-hepatitis B cirrhosis remains unknown. Aims: To elucidate the relationship between Th17 cells, Th17 cytokine and the inflammatory activity of liver tissue in post-hepatitis B cirrhosis. Methods: Twelve patients with HBV-associated acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF group), 12 patients with G2-G4 grade HBV-associated liver cirrhosis (LC group) and 11 healthy controls (HC group) were enrolled. Liver tissue and peripheral blood samples were collected. Immunohistochemical method was used to measure the expression and distribution of IL-17 in liver tissue, real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to determine the expressions of Th17 cytokine IL-17 mRNA and Th17 cell specific transcription factor ROR\u03b3t mRNA in liver tissue, and ELISA was used to measure the level of serum IL-17. Results: Area infiltrated with IL-17 positive cells in ACLF group was significantly greater than that in LC group, while only few IL-17 positive cell infiltration was seen in HC group. Hepatic IL-17, ROR\u03b3t mRNA expressions and serum IL-17 level in ACLF group were significantly higher than those in LC group (P=0.0226, P=0.0531, P=0.0171), and those in LC group were significantly higher than those in HC group (P=0.0289, P=0.0005, P=0.0160). Hepatic IL-17 mRNA expression and serum IL-17 level were positively correlated with the inflammatory activity of liver tissue (rs=0.686, P<0.0001; rs=0.767, P<0.0001). Conclusions: Levels of Th17 cytokine IL-17 in liver tissue and serum are positively correlated with the severity of inflammation of liver tissue in post-hepatitis B cirrhosis, and Th17 cells and Th17 cytokine are involved in the liver injury of post-hepatitis B cirrhosis.",

        "abstract": "This study explored nephrotoxicity in elderly Chinese patients after exposure to vancomycin and other nephrotoxic risk factors. This was a single-center retrospective study. The patient population included those who were \u226560 years of age, had normal baseline serum creatinine values, and received vancomycin for \u226548 h between January 1, 2013 and August 30, 2014. Nephrotoxicity occurred in 29% of 124 patients. A baseline creatinine clearance \u226563.5 ml/min was more common in the nephrotoxic group. Patients with high (\u226515 mg/l) rather than low (<15 mg/l) average vancomycin troughs had elevated nephrotoxicity (47.2 vs. 27.3%, p = 0.0001). Of the comorbid conditions evaluated, there were more patients with shock (p = 0.001), hypertension (p = 0.020) and congestive heart failure (p = 0.04) in the nephrotoxic group. Drugs frequently given at the same time with vancomycin, such as angiotensin receptor blockers and furosemide, were also associated with increased nephrotoxic risk. In conclusion, nephrotoxicity was frequently observed in patients with concurrent vancomycin trough concentrations \u226515 \u03bcg/ml and hypertension, shock, congestive heart failure. In addition, drugs concurrently used with vancomycin may also increase its nephrotoxicity. Therefore, renal function and vancomycin serum troughs should be closely monitored, especially in patients with other renal injury risk factors. \u00a9 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.",

        "abstract": "Artemether and lumefantrine (also known as benflumetol) are difficult to formulate for parenteral administration because of their low aqueous solubility. Cremophor EL as an emulsion excipient has been shown to cause serious side effects. This study reports a method of preparation and the therapeutic efficacies of novel lipid emulsion (LE) delivery systems with artemether, lumefantrine, or artemether in combination with lumefantrine, for parenteral administration. Their physical and chemical stabilities were also evaluated. Furthermore, the in vivo antimalarial activities of the lipid emulsions developed were tested in Plasmodium berghei-infected mice. Artemether, lumefantrine, or artemether in combination with lumefantrine was encapsulated in an oil phase, and the in vivo performance was assessed by comparison with artesunate for injection. It was found that the lumefantrine lipid emulsion (LUM-LE) and artemether-lumefantrine lipid emulsion (ARM-LUM-LE-3) (1:6) began to decrease the parasitemia levels after only 3 days, and the parasitemia inhibition was 90% at doses of 0.32 and 0.27 mg/kg, respectively, with immediate antimalarial effects greater than those of the positive-control group and constant antimalarial effects over 30 days. LUM-LE and ARM-LUM-LE-3 demonstrated the best performance in terms of chemical and physical stabilities and antiplasmodial efficacy, with a mean particle size of 150 nm, and they have many favorable properties for parenteral administration, such as biocompatibility, physical stability, and ease of preparation.",

        "abstract": "Aims The aim was to reveal the effects of flooding on photosynthesis and growth of the riparian plant Salix variegata for revegetation of riparian areas in Three Gorges Reservoir Region.Methods Four flooding treatments were applied to the plants: no flooding,belowground submergence and whole plant submergence to water depths of 0.5 and 2 m.Net photosynthetic rate,apparent quantum yield,carboxylation efficiency,intercellular CO2 concentration and maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII(Fv/Fm) were determined at 0,40,60 and 90 d.The numbers of adventitious roots were determined at 6,15,25 and 32 d.Increase of stem length,increase of number of shoots,number of newly grown leaves on stem,number of shed leaves on stem,increase of root biomass and increase of plant biomass were determined at 10,20,40,60 and 90 d.Important findings Control and belowground-submerged plants maintained high net photosynthetic rate,apparent quantum yield and carboxylation efficiency during inundation.At 40 d,the net photosynthetic rate of S.variegata was significantly higher than that in the waterlogging-tolerant species S.babylonica (p<0.05).At 60 and 90 d,the photosynthetic capacity and Fv/Fm of wholly submerged plants decreased significantly as compared with that of the control and belowground-submerged plants(p<0.05),but the plants could still maintain high photosynthetic capacity. At 40,60 and 90 d,the intercellular CO2 concentration of wholly submerged plants was higher than that of the control and belowground-submerged plants.At 32 d,many adventitious roots were developed in belowground-submerged plants, while the wholly submerged plants had few adventitious roots.The belowgroundsubmerged plants had greater increase in stem length,number of shoots,and newly generated leaves on stem,root biomass and total plant biomass than wholly submerged plants.During the flooding period,the stem length,number of shoots,and newly generated leaves on stem,root biomass and total plant biomass of wholly submerged plants increased,and the number of shed leaves of wholly submerged plants was higher than that of the control and belowground-submerged plants.At 90 d,all belowground-submerged and wholly submerged S.variegata were alive.Therefore,S.variegata has high photosynthetic capacity and growth adaptability over inundation of 90 d and is a promising species for revegetation of the riparian zone in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region.",

        "abstract": "Objective To observe the effect of moxibustion of \"Dachangshu\"(BL 25) on pain reaction and expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1(TRPV 1) of bone marrow cells in visceral hyperalgesia(VHA) rats so as to explore its mechanism underlying visceral pain-relief.Methods Twenty-eight male SD rats were divided into control group,control+mo-xibustion group,VHA model and VHA+moxibustion group(n=7/group).The VHA model was made by giving colorectal distension(CRD,60 mmHg) to the newborn rats for 1 min(repeated once again in 30 min) from postnatal day 8 on,once daily for a week.Moxibustion was applied to ipsilateral \"Dachangshu\"(BL 25) area for 40 min from the 8th week on after birth.Abdominal withdrawal reflex(AWR) and pain threshold during CRD were measured before and after moxibustion.The TRPV 1 mRNA expression of bone marrow cells was detected by real time-PCR.Results \u2460 The AWR score of the model group was significantly higher than that of the control group,but the pain threshold of the model group was significantly lower than that of the control group(P<0.01),suggesting a VHA in model rats.\u2461 After moxibustion,the AWR scores were significantly lower in the VHA+moxibustion group than in the model group(P<0.05,P<0.01),and the pain threshold was remarkably higher in the former group than in the latter group(P<0.01).Similar results were found in the control+moxibustion group compared to the control group: the decreased AWR scores(CRD 40 mmHg,60 mmHg and 80 mmHg,P<0.01) and the increased pain threshold(P<0.05).\u2462The TRPV 1 mRNA expression level of bone marrow cells was significantly lower in the VHA+moxibustion group than in the model group(P<0.01).No significant difference was found between the control and moxibustion+control groups in TRPV 1 mRNA expression level(P>0.05).Conclusion Moxibustion of \"Dachangshu\"(BL 25) can reduce visceral hyperalgesia and down-regulate TRPV 1 mRNA expression of bone marrow cells in VHA rats,suggesting an involvement of TRPV 1 mRNA of bone marrow cells in CRD-induced visceral pain development.",

        "abstract": "To observe the effect of moxibustion of \"Dachangshu\" (BL 25) on pain reaction and expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV 1) of bone marrow cells in visceral hyperalgesia (VHA) rats so as to explore its mechanism underlying visceral pain-relief.Twenty-eight male SD rats were divided into control group, control+moxibustion group, VHA model and VHA+moxibustion group (n = 7/group). The VHA model was made by giving colorectal distension (CRD, 60 mmHg) to the newborn rats for 1 min (repeated once again in 30 min) from postnatal day 8 on, once daily for a week. Moxibustion was applied to ipsilateral \"Dachangshu\"(BL 25) area for 40 min from the 8th week on after birth. Abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) and pain threshold during CRD were measured before and after moxibustion. The TRPV 1 mRNA expressio of bone marrow cells was detected by real time-POR.(1) The AWR score of the model group was significantly higher than that of the control group, but the pain threshold of the model group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P < 0.01), suggesting a VHA in model rats. (2) After moxibustion, the AWR scores were significantly lower in the VHA+moxibustion group than in the model group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), and the pain threshold was remarkably higher in the former group than in the latter group (P < 0.01). Similar results were found in the control+moxibustion group compared to the control group: the decreased AWR scores (CRD 40 mmHg, 60 mmHg and 80 mmHg, P < 0.01) and the increased pain threshold (P < 0.05). (3) The TRPV 1 mRNA expression level of bone marrow cells was significantly lower in the VHA + moxibustion group than in the model group (P < 0.01). No significant difference was found between the control and moxibustion+control groups in TRPV 1 mRNA expression level (P > 0.05).Moxibustion of \"Dachangshu\" (BL 25) can reduce visceral hyperalgesia and down-regulate TRPV 1 mRNA expression of bone marrow cells in VHA rats, suggesting an involvement of TRPV 1 mRNA of bone marrow cells in CRD-induced visceral pain development.",

        "abstract": "Although most activating mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are sensitive to available EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), a subset with alterations in exon 20 of EGFR and HER2 are intrinsically resistant and lack an effective therapy. We used in silico, in vitro, and in vivo testing to model structural alterations induced by exon 20 mutations and to identify effective inhibitors. 3D modeling indicated alterations restricted the size of the drug-binding pocket, limiting the binding of large, rigid inhibitors. We found that poziotinib, owing to its small size and flexibility, can circumvent these steric changes and is a potent inhibitor of the most common EGFR and HER2 exon 20 mutants. Poziotinib demonstrated greater activity than approved EGFR TKIs in vitro and in patient-derived xenograft models of EGFR or HER2 exon 20 mutant NSCLC and in genetically engineered mouse models of NSCLC. In a phase 2 trial, the first 11 patients with NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 mutations receiving poziotinib had a confirmed objective response rate of 64%. These data identify poziotinib as a potent, clinically active inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 exon 20 mutations and illuminate the molecular features of TKIs that may circumvent steric changes induced by these mutations.",

        "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has the highest malignancy among all lung cancers, exhibiting aggressive growth and early metastasis to distant sites. For 30 years, treatment options for SCLC have been limited to chemotherapy, warranting the need for more effective treatments. Frequent inactivation of TP53 and RB1 as well as histone dysmodifications in SCLC suggest that transcriptional and epigenetic regulations play a major role in SCLC disease evolution. Here we performed a synthetic lethal screen using the BET inhibitor JQ1 and an shRNA library targeting 550 epigenetic genes in treatment-refractory SCLC xenograft models and identified HDAC6 as a synthetic lethal target in combination with JQ1. Combined treatment of human and mouse SCLC cell line-derived xenograft tumors with the HDAC6 inhibitor ricolinostat (ACY-1215) and JQ1 demonstrated significant inhibition of tumor growth; this effect was abolished upon depletion of NK cells, suggesting that these innate immune lymphoid cells play a role in SCLC tumor treatment response. Collectively, these findings suggest a potential new treatment for recurrent SCLC.",

        "abstract": "Necitumumab (EGFR inhibitor) in combination with chemotherapy provides a modest, yet a significant improvement in overall survival over chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). However, combination therapies targeting EGFR and PD-1 pathway blockers may represent a better way to extend clinical benefit to more cancer patients given that PD-(L)1 antibodies have emerged as a standard of care in NSCLC. Antibodies targeting EGFR have the potential to promote an inflamed tumor microenvironment through engagement of Fc-gamma receptors (Fc\u03b3R) on innate immune cells resulting in an improved antigen presentation and T cell priming. Therefore, the present study was initiated to understand the combinatorial effect of immune checkpoint (PD-(L)1) inhibitors with necitumumab. Preclinical modeling of EGFR/PD-(L)1 mAb combination in mice is challenging due to the lack of cross-reactivity of necitumumab with mouse EGFR. Syngeneic mouse tumor models widely used to study effects of immunomodulatory agents express low or no EGFR. To overcome this limitation, we used two immunocompetent model systems to study the combination effect of EGFR mAb with PD-1 (RMP1-14) or PD-L1 (178G7) mAbs: 1) genetically engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma (TD model) driven by mutant forms of human EGFR (exon 19 deletion and T790M mutation) and 2) CT26 syngeneic mouse tumor model with ectopic expression of human EGFR (CT26-hEGFR). To engage mouse immune cells more efficiently, a murinized version of necitumumab was generated through antibody engineering, with human EGFR binding Fabs and a mouse Fc backbone. Intratumor immune response was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and a custom-made immune profiling Quantigene Plex (QGP) gene expression panel. In both models, targeting EGFR and PD-1 pathway resulted in the combinatorial antitumor efficacy exemplified by decreased tumor burden compared to the monotherapy groups. QGP analysis of CT26-hEGFR tumor tissue revealed that the combination treatment enhanced intra-tumor immune response exemplified by an upregulation of immune-related genes indicative of T cell infiltration (Cd3e, Cd4, Cd8b1), T cell activation (Ifng, Cd274, Pdcd1lg2, Icos, Tnfrsf4, Tnfrsf18, Cd69, Ido1, Havcr2, Lag3), myeloid cell infiltration (Cd86, Timd4, Vista, Cd68, Mpo, Nos2). Histopathological analysis confirmed an increase in T cell infiltration indicating an improved immune response in the combination therapy group. Taken together, these results provide a rationale for further evaluation of EGFR and PD-(L)1 mAbs in clinical setting.   Citation Format:  Veena Kandaswamy, Amelie Forest, Marianne Deroose, David A.

        "abstract": "HER2 mutations have been classified as oncogenic drivers that are present in 2-4% of lung adenocarcinomas. However, due to limited preclinical studies and clinical trials, there is still no available standard of care for this group of lung cancer patients. To fulfill the clinical need for targeting HER2 mutations in lung cancer patients, we performed a comprehensive preclinical study to evaluate the efficacy of neratinib, an irreversible small-molecule pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor that potently binds and inhibits EGFR, HER2, and HER4. We used the previously described genetically modified mouse model (GEMM) of lung adenocarcinomas driven by the major mutant form of human HER2 exon 20 insertions (A775_G776insYVMA) for testing neratinib either as a single agent or in combination with other therapies including trastuzumab in vivo. Treatment efficacy was evaluated based on both monitoring tumor volume changes and survival. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used for quantifying tumor burden. Tolerability and the overall health of animals were evaluated based on body weight change. We found that neratinib treatment alone provided a modest yet significant response in inhibiting HER2 mutant lung tumors in this model. Pharmacodynamic studies showed that neratinib effectively abolished HER2 phosphorylation and inhibited major downstream signaling targets such as pAKT and pERK. Moreover, combination therapy with neratinib and trastuzumab showed a greater treatment effect by reducing tumor burden with significantly longer progression-free survival and overall survival compared to single agents tested. In all neratinib-based regimens, body weight of treated animals remained stable. On this basis, our study provides a strong rationale to test the combination of neratinib with trastuzumab for the treatment of HER2 mutant NSCLC patients.

HER2 TKIs including afatinib and dacomitinib have objective response rates  st  and 3 rd  generation TKIs failed to inhibit cell (IC 50  values u003e115nM). While 2 nd  generation TKIs had some activity (average IC 50  =11nM), poziotinib significantly inhibited the growth of all HER2 exon 20 mutations tested with an average IC 50  value of 1.9nM. 3D modeling revealed that HER2 exon 20 insertions induce conformational changes which cause constitutive activation and steric hindrance of C805 reducing the ability of larger TKIs to covalently bind. Therefore the smaller flexible terminal group of poziotinib can overcome the structural changes induced by exon 20 insertions. To test this in vivo HER2 A775insYVMA GEMMs were treated daily with poziotinib. Treatment reduced tumor burden by 60% at 4 weeks and had a durable response of 322 days. Based on preclinical data, a heavily pre-treated patient with HER2 driven NSCLC (HER2 A771insAYVM) was placed on a compassionate use protocol and received 16mg poziotinib daily. After 4 weeks, the patient experienced a significant radiological response with reduction in FDG avidity in the left 7 th  rib, right sacrum and a right lower lobe nodule among others.

        "abstract": "Activating mutations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway are frequently identified in cancer. To identify pathways that support PI3K oncogenesis, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen in isogenic cell lines harboring wild-type or mutant PIK3CA to search for PI3K synthetic-lethal (SL) genes. A combined analysis of these results with a meta-analysis of two other large-scale RNAi screening data sets in PI3K mutant cancer cell lines converged on ribosomal protein translation and proteasomal protein degradation as critical nononcogene dependencies for PI3K-driven tumors. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of either pathway alone, but not together, selectively killed PI3K mutant tumor cells in an mTOR-dependent manner. The expression of ribosomal and proteasomal components was significantly up-regulated in primary human colorectal tumors harboring PI3K pathway activation. Importantly, a PI3K SL gene signature containing the top hits of the SL genes identified in our meta-analysis robustly predicted overall patient survival in colorectal cancer, especially among patients with tumors with an activated PI3K pathway. These results suggest that disruption of protein turnover homeostasis via ribosome or proteasome inhibition may be a novel treatment strategy for PI3K mutant human tumors.",

        "abstract": "An increasingly recognized component of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) involves persistence of a drug-tolerant subpopulation of cancer cells which survive despite effective eradication of the majority of the cell population. Multiple groups have demonstrated that these drug-tolerant persister cells undergo transcriptional adaptation via an epigenetic state change that promotes cell survival. Because this mode of TKI drug tolerance appears to involve transcriptional addiction to specific genes and pathways, we hypothesized that systematic functional screening of EGFR TKI/transcriptional inhibitor combination therapy would yield important mechanistic insights and alternative drug escape pathways. We therefore performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 enhancer/suppressor screen in EGFR-dependent lung cancer PC9 cells treated with erlotinib + THZ1 (CDK7/12 inhibitor) combination therapy,a combination previously shown to suppress drug tolerant cells in this setting. As expected, suppression of multiple genes associated with transcriptional complexes (EP300, CREBBP and MED1) enhanced erlotinib/THZ1 synergy. Unexpectedly, we uncovered nearly every component of the recently described ufmylation pathway in the synergy suppressor group. Loss of ufmylation did not affect canonical downstream EGFR signaling. Instead, absence of this pathway triggered a protective unfolded protein response (UPR) associated with STING upregulation, promoting pro-tumorigenic inflammatory signaling but also unique dependence on Bcl-xL. These data reveal that dysregulation of ufmylation and ER stress comprise a previously unrecognized TKI drug tolerance pathway that engages survival signaling, with potentially important therapeutic implications.",

        "abstract": "Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma is a deadly disease where systemic therapy has relied upon empiric chemotherapy despite the presence of genomic alterations pointing to candidate therapeutic targets, including recurrent amplification of the gene encoding receptor tyrosine kinase epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Here, we demonstrate that EGFR-targeting small-molecule inhibitors have efficacy in EGFR-amplified oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), but may become quickly ineffective. Resistance can occur following the emergence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and by reactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway following EGFR blockade. We demonstrate that blockade of this rebound activation with MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase) inhibition enhances EGFR inhibitor-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and delays resistance to EGFR monotherapy. Furthermore, genomic profiling shows that cell cycle regulators are altered in the majority of EGFR-amplified tumours and a combination of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) and EGFR inhibitors prevents the emergence of resistance in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that upfront combination strategies targeting EGFR amplification, guided by adaptive pathway reactivation or by co-occurring genomic alterations, should be tested clinically.",

Unrestrained proliferation is a critical hallmark of cancer. We constructed modular, barcoded libraries of human open reading frames (ORFs) and performed screens for proliferation regulators in multiple cell types. Approximately 10% of genes regulate proliferation, with most performing in an unexpectedly highly tissue-specific manner. Proliferation drivers in a given cell type showed specific enrichment in somatic copy number changes (SCNAs) from cognate tumors and helped predict aneuploidy patterns in\u00a0those tumors, implying that tissue-type-specific genetic network architectures underlie SCNA and driver selection in different cancers. In\u00a0vivo screening confirmed these results. We report a substantial contribution to\u00a0the catalog of SCNA-associated cancer drivers, identifying 147 amplified and 107 deleted genes as potential drivers, and derive insights about the genetic network architecture of aneuploidy in tumors.",

        "abstract": "CDK4 is emerging as a target in -mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We demonstrate that -mutant NSCLC cell lines are initially sensitive to the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, but readily acquire resistance associated with increased expression of CDK6, D-type cyclins and cyclin E. Resistant cells also demonstrated increased ERK1/2 activity and sensitivity to MEK and ERK inhibitors. Moreover, MEK inhibition reduced the expression and activity of cell cycle proteins mediating palbociclib resistance. In resistant cells, ERK activated mTOR, driven in part by upstream FGFR1 signaling resulting from the extracellular secretion of FGF ligands. A genetically-engineered mouse model of -mutant NSCLC initially sensitive to palbociclib similarly developed acquired resistance with increased expression of cell cycle mediators, ERK1/2 and FGFR1. In this model, resistance was delayed with combined palbociclib and MEK inhibitor treatment. These findings implicate an FGFR1-MAP kinase-mTOR pathway resulting in increased expression of D-cyclins and CDK6 that confers palbociclib resistance and indicate that CDK4/6 inhibition acts to promote MAP kinase dependence.",

Combined downstream RAL-TBK1 and MEK inhibition induces only transient lung tumor shrinkage in KRAS-driven genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs). Using the sensitive KRAS;LKB1 (KL) mutant background, we identify YAP1 upregulation and a therapy-induced secretome as mediators of acquired resistance. This program is reversible, associated with H3K27 promoter acetylation, and suppressed by BET inhibition, resensitizing resistant KL cells to TBK1/MEK inhibition. Constitutive YAP1 signaling promotes intrinsic resistance in KRAS;TP53 (KP) mutant lung cancer. Intermittent treatment with the BET inhibitor JQ1 thus overcomes resistance to combined pathway inhibition in KL and KP GEMMs. Using potent and selective TBK1 and BET inhibitors we further develop an effective therapeutic strategy with potential translatability to the clinic.",

We discovered upregulation of receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (RIP1) in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in PDA. To study its role in oncogenic progression, we developed a selective small-molecule RIP1 inhibitor with high in\u00a0vivo exposure. Targeting RIP1 reprogrammed TAMs toward an MHCIITNF\u03b1IFN\u03b3 immunogenic phenotype in a STAT1-dependent manner. RIP1 inhibition in TAMs resulted in cytotoxic T\u00a0cell activation and T helper cell differentiation toward a mixed Th1/Th17 phenotype, leading to tumor immunity in mice and in organotypic models of human PDA. Targeting RIP1 synergized with PD1-and inducible co-stimulator-based immunotherapies. Tumor-promoting effects of RIP1 were independent of its co-association with RIP3. Collectively, our work describes RIP1 as a checkpoint kinase governing tumor immunity.",

        "abstract": "Multiple mechanisms of resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been identified in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, recurrent resistance to EGFR TKIs due to the heterogeneous mechanisms underlying resistance within a single patient remains a major challenge in the clinic. Here, we report a role of nuclear protein kinase C\u03b4 (PKC\u03b4) as a common axis across multiple known TKI-resistance mechanisms. Specifically, we demonstrate that TKI-inactivated\u00a0EGFR dimerizes with other membrane receptors implicated in TKI resistance to promote PKC\u03b4 nuclear translocation. Moreover, the level of nuclear PKC\u03b4 is associated with TKI response in patients. The combined inhibition of PKC\u03b4 and EGFR induces marked regression of resistant NSCLC tumors with EGFR mutations.",

        "abstract": "Most tumours have an aberrantly activated lipid metabolism that enables them to synthesize, elongate and desaturate fatty acids to support proliferation. However, only particular subsets of cancer cells are sensitive to approaches that target fatty acid metabolism and, in particular, fatty acid desaturation. This suggests that many cancer cells contain an unexplored plasticity in their fatty acid metabolism. Here we show that some cancer cells can exploit an alternative fatty acid desaturation pathway. We identify various cancer cell lines, mouse hepatocellular carcinomas, and primary human liver and lung carcinomas that desaturate palmitate to the unusual fatty acid sapienate to support membrane biosynthesis during proliferation. Accordingly, we found that sapienate biosynthesis enables cancer cells to bypass the known fatty acid desaturation pathway that is dependent on stearoyl-CoA desaturase. Thus, only by targeting both desaturation pathways is the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of cancer cells that synthesize sapienate impaired. Our discovery explains metabolic plasticity in fatty acid desaturation and constitutes an unexplored metabolic rewiring in cancers.",

In the present study, we identify and study a mutant-selective EGFR allosteric inhibitor, JBJ-04-125-02, which as a single agent, can inhibit cell proliferation and EGFR L858R/T790M/C797S signaling in vitro and in vivo. However, increased EGFR dimer formation limits treatment efficacy and leads to drug resistance. Remarkably, osimertinib, an ATP-competitive covalent EGFR inhibitor, uniquely and significantly enhances the binding of JBJ-04-125-02 for mutant EGFR. The combination of osimertinib and JBJ-04-125-02 results in an increase in apoptosis, a more effective inhibition of cellular growth, and an increased efficacy in vitro and in vivo compared to either single agent alone. Collectively, our findings suggest that the combination of a covalent mutant-selective ATP-competitive and an allosteric EGFR inhibitor may be an effective therapeutic approach for patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer.",

        "abstract": "The CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), which anchors DNA loops that organize the genome into structural domains, has a central role in gene control by facilitating or constraining interactions between genes and their regulatory elements. In cancer cells, the disruption of CTCF binding at specific loci by somatic mutation or DNA hypermethylation results in the loss of loop anchors and consequent activation of oncogenes. By contrast, the germ-cell-specific paralogue of CTCF, BORIS (brother of the regulator of imprinted sites, also known as CTCFL), is overexpressed in several cancers, but its contributions to the malignant phenotype remain unclear. Here we show that aberrant upregulation of BORIS promotes chromatin interactions in ALK-mutated, MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells that develop resistance to ALK inhibition. These cells are reprogrammed to a distinct phenotypic state during the acquisition of resistance, a process defined by the initial loss of MYCN expression followed by subsequent overexpression of BORIS and a concomitant switch in cellular dependence from MYCN to BORIS. The resultant BORIS-regulated alterations in chromatin looping lead to the formation of super-enhancers that drive the ectopic expression of a subset of proneural transcription factors that ultimately define the resistance phenotype. These results identify a previously unrecognized role of BORIS-to promote regulatory chromatin interactions that support specific cancer phenotypes.",

        "abstract": "Proceedings: AACR 107th Annual Meeting 2016; April 16-20, 2016; New Orleans, LAKRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet remains resistant to targeted therapy. Previously, we reported that RAL-TBK1 activation downstream of KRAS promotes an autocrine cytokine circuit that fuels tumorigenesis. Interruption of this signaling by treatment with momelotinib, an inhibitor of TBK1/IKKe and JAK kinases, together with MEK inhibition, was effective in the aggressive Kras-p53 (KP) mouse lung cancer model. These findings have prompted a human clinical trial of momelotinib and trametinib in advanced refractory KRAS mutant NSCLC. Because this combination leads to acquired resistance in mice, we sought to understand additional pathways that could compensate for TBK1/JAK and MEK inhibition. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) profiling of A549 cells treated with momelotinib revealed delayed activation of IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) signaling. Indeed, IGF1 supplementation partially rescued momelotinib-induced growth arrest of A549 cells, while combination of momelotinib with the dual IGF1R/insulin receptor (IR) inhibitor linsitinib cooperated to impair cell viability, which was more pronounced in KRAS/STK11 (encoding LKB1) mutant cell lines compared with LKB1 wild type cell lines. Triple momelotinib/trametinib/linsitinib therapy also improved tumor shrinkage in Kras-Lkb1 (KL) mice compared with KP mice. However, chronic treatment with this triple combination required pulse therapy due to toxicity, and was inferior to momelotinib/trametinib dosed daily, which itself promoted deep responses in KL mice lasting 6 weeks.In parallel, we analyzed mediators of acquired resistance to chronic momelotinib and MEK inhibitor exposure in A549 cells. Interestingly, IGF1 expression was dramatically upregulated in resistant cells, in contrast to IGF2, and enhanced autocrine activation of IGF1R signaling. Importantly, both IGF1 upregulation and inhibitor resistance were completely reversible after drug withdrawal for several passages, yet reappeared quickly upon drug readdition, suggesting epigenetic reprogramming. Consistent with this hypothesis, whereas global H3K27 histone acetylation was decreased in resistant cells, this epigenetic mark was strongly enriched at the IGF1 promoter and linked tightly with both IGF1 levels and drug resistance. Treatment of resistant A549 cells with the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 completely suppressed IGF1 expression and downstream IGF1R activation, and impaired cell viability. Combination JQ1 treatment also prevented momelotinib/MEK inhibitor induction of IGF1 in A549 cells, synergized to reduce outgrowth of resistant cells, and was well tolerated as daily triple combination therapy in mice. Together, these findings suggest the potential of BET inhibition to synergize with and prevent the development of acquired resistance to momelotinib and MEK inhibitor treatment in KRAS mutant NSCLC.Citation Format: Shunsuke Kitajima, Hajime Asahina, Jillian D.

        "title": "Rolipram Attenuates Early Brain Injury Following Experimental Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in Rats: Possibly via Regulating the SIRT1/NF-\u03baB Pathway.",
        "abstract": "Early brain injury (EBI) is the primary cause of poor outcome in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients. Rolipram, a specific phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor which is traditionally used as an anti-depressant drug, has been recently proven to exert neuroprotective effects in several central nervous system insults. However, the role of rolipram in SAH remains uncertain. The current study was aimed to investigate the role of rolipram in EBI after SAH and explore the potential mechanism. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to an endovascular perforation process to produce an SAH model. Rolipram was injected intraperitoneally at 2\u00a0h after SAH with a dose of 10\u00a0mg/kg. We found that rolipram significantly ameliorated brain edema and alleviated neurological dysfunction after SAH. Rolipram treatment remarkably promoted the expression of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) while inhibited NF-\u03baB activation. Moreover, rolipram significantly inhibited the activation of microglia as well as down-regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u00df, and IL-6. In addition, rolipram increased the expression of protective cytokine IL-10. Furthermore, rolipram significantly alleviated neuronal death after SAH. In conclusion, these data suggested that rolipram exerts neuroprotective effects against EBI after SAH via suppressing neuroinflammation and reducing neuronal loss. The neuroprotective effects of rolipram were associated with regulating the SIRT1/NF-\u03baB pathway. Rolipram could be a novel and promising therapeutic agent for SAH treatment.",

        "abstract": "Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) plays a fundamental role in a range of central nervous system (CNS) insults, however, the role of PDE4 in early brain injury (EBI) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) remains unclear. The current study was designed to investigate the role of PDE4 in EBI after SAH and explore the potential mechanism. The SAH model in Sprague-Dawley rat was established by endovascular perforation process. Rats were randomly divided into: sham group, SAH?+?vehicle group, SAH?+?rolipram (PDE4 inhibitor) group, SAH?+?rolipram?+?sirtinol (SIRT1 inhibitor) group and SAH?+?rolipram+MK2206 (Akt inhibitor) group. Mortality, SAH grades, neurological function, brain edema, immunofluorescence staining and western blotting were performed. Double fluorescence labeling staining indicated that PDE4 was located predominately in neurons after SAH. Rolipram reduced brain edema, improved neurological function in the rat model of SAH. Moreover, rolipram increased the expression of Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) and up-regulated the phosphorylation of Akt, which was accompanied by the reduction of neuronal apoptosis. Administration of sirtinol inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt. Moreover, all the beneficial effects of rolipram against SAH were abolished by both sirtinol and MK2206. These data indicated that PDE4 inhibition by rolipram protected rats against EBI after SAH via suppressing neuronal apoptosis through the SIRT1/Akt pathway. Rolipram might be an important therapeutic drug for SAH.",

        "abstract": "Necroptosis is an inflammatory form of cell death that depends on receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase 3 (RIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) and displays the morphological characteristics of necrosis. To date, it is unclear to what extent necroptosis contributes to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) induced brain injury. The present study aimed to investigate the RIPK3-mediated necroptosis and the effects of the RIPK3 selective inhibitor GSK'872 in early brain injury following SAH. After SAH, RIPK3 expression increased as early as 6\u2009h and peaked at 72\u2009h. Double immunofluorescence staining revealed that RIPK3 was mainly located in neurons. Most necrotic cells were neurons, which were further confirmed by TEM. Intracerebroventricular injection of GSK'872 (25\u2009mM) could attenuate brain edema and improve neurological function following SAH and reduce the number of necrotic cells. In addition, GSK'872 could also decrease the protein levels of RIPK3 and MLKL, and cytoplasmic translocation and expression of HMGB1, an important pro-inflammatory protein. Taken together, the current study provides the new evidence that RIPK3-mediated necroptosis is involved in early brain injury and GSK'872 decreases the RIPK3-mediated necroptosis and subsequent cytoplasmic translocation and expression of HMGB1, as well as ameliorates brain edema and neurological deficits.",

        "abstract": "Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a severe cerebrovascular disease with few effective pharmacotherapies available. Salvia miltiorrhiza, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, has been widely used to treat cardiovascular diseases for centuries. Recent studies have demonstrated that magnesium lithospermate B (MLB), a bioactive ingredient extracted from Salvia miltiorrhiza, exerts neuroprotective effects in several central nervous system insults. However, little is known about the role of MLB in SAH-induced brain injury and the exact molecular mechanism. In the current study, we studied the neuroprotective effects of MLB in SAH and explored the potential mechanism. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to an endovascular perforation process to produce an SAH model. MLB was administrated intraperitoneally at 30[Formula: see text]min after SAH with a dose of 25[Formula: see text]mg/kg or 50[Formula: see text]mg/kg. We found that administration of MLB significantly attenuated brain edema and neurological deficits after SAH. In addition, immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that MLB dose-dependently inhibited the activation of microglia and reduced neuronal apoptosis. Western blot analysis showed that MLB decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokine TNF-[Formula: see text] and pro-apoptotic protein cleaved caspase-3. More importantly, MLB increased the expression of SIRT1, while inhibited the acetylation of NF-[Formula: see text]B. Furthermore, pretreatment with sirtinol (a selective inhibitor of SIRT1) reversed all the aforementioned effects of MLB after SAH. In conclusion, our results indicated that MLB exerted robust neuroprotective effects against SAH via suppressing neuroinflammation and apoptosis. These neuroprotective effects of MLB against SAH might be exerted via regulating the SIRT1/NF-[Formula: see text]B pathway. MLB or the SIRT1/NF-[Formula: see text]B pathway could be a novel and promising therapeutic strategy for SAH management.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNA-214(miR-214) has been recently reported to regulate angiogenesis and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) differentiation. However, very little is known about its functional role in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) differentiation from ESCs. In the present study, we assessed the hypothesis that miR-214 and its target genes play an important role in VSMCs differentiation. Murine ESCs were seeded on collagen-coated flasks and cultured in differentiation medium for 2 to 8 days to allow VSMCs differentiation. miR-214 was significantly upregulated during VSMCs differentiation. miR-214 overexpression and knockdown in differentiating ESCs significantly promoted and inhibited VSMCs -specific genes expression, respectively. Importantly, miR-214 overexpression in ESCs promoted VSMCs differentiation in vivo. Quaking (QKI) was predicted as one of the major targets of miR-214, which was negatively regulated by miR-214. Luciferase assay showed miR-214 substantially inhibited wild type, but not the mutant version of QKI-3-UTR-luciferase activity in differentiating ESCs, further confirming a negative regulation role of miR-214 in QKI gene expression. Mechanistically, our data showed that miR-214 regulated VSMCs gene expression during VSMCs differentiation from ESCs through suppression of QKI. We further demonstrated that QKI down-regulated the expression of SRF, MEF2C and Myocd through transcriptional repression and direct binding to promoters of the SRF, MEF2c and Myocd genes. Taken together, we have uncovered a central role of miR-214 in ESC-VSMC differentiation, and successfully identified QKI as a functional modulating target in miR-214 mediated VSMCs differentiation.",

        "abstract": "Vascular, resident stem cells are present in all 3 layers of the vessel wall; they play a role in vascular formation under physiological conditions and in remodeling in pathological situations. Throughout development and adult early life, resident stem cells participate in vessel formation through vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. In adults, the vascular stem cells are mostly quiescent in their niches but can be activated in response to injury and participate in endothelial repair and smooth muscle cell accumulation to form neointima. However, delineation of the characteristics and of the migration and differentiation behaviors of these stem cells is an area of ongoing investigation. A set of genetic mouse models for cell lineage tracing has been developed to specifically address the nature of these cells and both migration and differentiation processes during physiological angiogenesis and in vascular diseases. This review summarizes the current knowledge on resident stem cells, which has become more defined and refined in vascular biology research, thus contributing to the development of new potential therapeutic strategies to promote endothelial regeneration and ameliorate vascular disease development.",

        "abstract": "Objective- Vascular adventitia encompasses progenitors and is getting recognized as the major site of inflammation in early stage of atherosclerosis. However, the cellular atlas of the heterogeneous adventitial cells, the intercellular communication, the cellular response of adventitia to hyperlipidemia, and its contribution to atherosclerosis have been elusive. Approach and Results- Single-cell RNA sequencing was applied to wt (wild type) and ApoE (apolipoprotein E)-deficient aortic adventitia from 12-week-old C57BL/6J mice fed on normal laboratory diet with early stage of atherosclerosis. Unbiased clustering analysis revealed that the landscape of adventitial cells encompassed adventitial mesenchyme cells, immune cells (macrophages, T cells, and B cells), and some types of rare cells, for example, neuron, lymphatic endothelial cells, and innate lymphoid cells. Seurat clustering analysis singled out 6 nonimmune clusters with distinct transcriptomic profiles, in which there predominantly were stem/progenitor cell-like and proinflammatory population (Mesen II). In ApoE-deficient adventitia, resident macrophages were activated and related to increased myeloid cell infiltration in the adventitia. Cell communication analysis further elucidated enhanced interaction between a mesenchyme cluster and inflammatory macrophages in ApoE-deficient adventitia. In vitro transwell assay confirmed the proinflammatory role of SCA1 Mesen II population with increased CCL2 secretion and thus increased capacity to attract immune cells in ApoE-deficient adventitia. Conclusions- Cell atlas defined by single-cell RNA sequencing depicted the heterogeneous cellular landscape of the adventitia and uncovered several types of cell populations. Furthermore, resident cell interaction with immune cells appears crucial at the early stage of atherosclerosis.",

Previous studies have shown that the abnormal expression of metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1) was associated with tumorigenesis, progression, metastasis, and apoptosis in many cancer types. However, little is known about its functional involvement in the cross-talk of AECs with dendritic cells (DCs). The aim of the present study was to identify Malat1 as a novel epithelial cell-derived immune-modulating factor that contributes to the specific inflammatory-immune airway microenvironment. By using an  co-culture model, where layers of AECs can interact with DCs, and transfecting Malat1 siRNA in AECs, AEC-conditioned DCs were harvested for further analysis of the celluar phenotype, secretion of inflammatory chemokines, and expression of apoptotic markers. The present study clearly demonstrated that Malat1 modulates the maturation process, pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and apoptosis in AECs-conditioned DCs.",

        "abstract": "This study explored the effects of NaCl on volatile fatty acid (VFA) production from food waste by acidogenic fermentation. The production and composition of VFAs, and the microbial community in acidogenic fermentation were investigated at four different NaCl concentrations: 10, 30, 50, and 70\u202fg/L, and at 0\u202fg/L (control). The highest VFA production was 0.542\u202fg/g dry weight of food waste at 10\u202fg/L NaCl, and about 23% lower but still high at 70\u202fg/L NaCl. Interestingly, as NaCl concentration increased, the residence time of lactic acid in the reactor increased, and the maximum production also increased. The type of acidogenic fermentation also changed from butyric acid to propionic acid as the NaCl concentration increased. Microbial community analysis showed that a large number of propionibacteria were present at the end of fermentation, indicating their high tolerance to NaCl.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to explore the effects of redox potential (ORP) and inoculum on volatile fatty acids (VFAs) production from food waste by acidogenic fermentation. Four experimental conditions with two ORP levels were tested: limited aeration conditions with ORP level of -100 to -200mV inoculating anaerobic sludge (LA+AnS) or aerobic sludge (LA+AeS), and anaerobic conditions with ORP level of -200 to -300mV inoculating anaerobic sludge with 2-bromoethanosulfophate (AN+BES) and without BES (AN). The maximal VFA yield (0.79g COD/g VS) was attained in LA+AnS reactor due to enhanced hydrolysis of substrates, especially proteins (degradation efficiency 78.3%). A higher frequency of phylum Firmicutes under limited aeration conditions (42.2-48.2%) was observed than that under anaerobic conditions (21.1%). The microbial community was more diverse in LA+AnS reactors than LA+AeS. We conclude that appropriate ORP level (from -100 to -200mV) and inoculum play essential roles in VFA production. ",

VFA production, composition, conversion pathways and microbial communities in acidogenesis from tofu and egg white with and without hydrothermal (HT) pretreatment were compared. The results showed HT pretreatment could improve the VFA production of tofu but not for egg white. The optimum VFA yields were 0.46g/gVS (tofu with HT) and 0.26g/gVS (egg white without HT), respectively. Tofu could directly produce VFAs through the Stickland reaction, while egg white was converted to lactate and VFAs simultaneously. About 30-40% of total protein remained in all groups after fermentation. Up to 50% of the unconverted soluble protein in the HT groups was protease. More lactate-producing bacteria, mainly Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus, were present during egg white fermentation.",

Fuzzy evaluation method based on life cycle assessment and cost-benefit analysis was employed. Single-factor evaluation of environmental impacts and energy consumption indicated that AD was a green and clean energy producing technology. The study indicated that the total environmental impact was not significant at 6.65 E-03, and the net energy output (186.01\u00a0MJ) was slightly higher than the net energy input (167.47\u00a0MJ), when only methane production was considered. However, economic benefits were not ideal, recording loss of 64.99 RMB for each ton of food waste. Additionally, results of comprehensive evaluation conducted using fuzzy mathematical model were consistent with above results. Environmental benefits, energy consumption, and economic benefits of AD technology were 4.75, 3.58, and 1.36, corresponding to grades I, \u2161, and IV, respectively. Single benefits decreased in the order of environmental impact\u00a0u003e\u00a0energy consumption\u00a0u003e\u00a0economic benefit, indicating that economic benefit is the restrictive factor in integrated environ-economic benefits of AD technology in practice. Thus, increasing economic benefit should be the focus of research and management processes. Additionally, overall environ-economic benefit of AD rated good (Grade II), with a value of 3.39. Further sensitivity analysis results confirmed the stability of the comprehensive evaluation model. The established fuzzy mathematical evaluation model can realize comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of environ-economic benefits of AD technology; serve as valuable reference for perfecting evaluation systems, and assist in rational choice of renewable energy recovery technology from food waste.",

This research investigated the effect of activated persulfate on gas production from FW AD. Three activation methods including heating, lighting, and ultrasonication were used. The results showed that the addition of activated persulfate promoted gas production from FW AD. And the main biogas composition were CH 4 , CO 2 , and N 2 . The difference in SO 4  2\u2212  concentration further verified the effect of activated methods on producing sulfate free radicals by heating, lighting and ultrasonication from persulfate. The activated persulfate enhanced gas production by improving the organic hydrolysis. Relatively, lighting and ultrasonication were better than heating in persulfate activation. At the same time, the accumulated gas volumes from ultrasonication (587\u202fmL) and lighting (574\u202fmL) were significantly higher than that in heating (478\u202fmL). The environmental impact assessment and economic assessment suggests that the addition of activated persulfate in FW AD is beneficial because of the lower secondary pollution, lower cost and higher additional value.",

The content of soluble substances such as protein and carbohydrate in the FW increased after the hydrothermal pretreatment with phosphoric acid addition (\u2a7d5%). The SCOD approached approximately 29.0\u00a0g/L in 5% phosphoric acid group, which is almost 65% more than the original FW. The hydrothermal condition was 160\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min, which means that at least 40% of energy and 60% of reaction time were saved to achieve the expected pretreatment effect. Subsequent fermentation tests showed that the optimal dosage of phosphoric acid was 3% with a VFA yield of 0.763\u00a0g/g\u00a0VS removal , but the increase in salinity caused by phosphoric acid could adversely affect the acidogenesis. With an increase in the quantity of phosphoric acid, among the VFAs, the percentage of propionic acid decreased and that of butyric acid increased. The PCR-DGGE analysis indicated that the microbial diversity could decrease with excessive phosphoric acid, which resulted in a low VFA yield.",

Here, the effects of different melanoidins doses on volatile fatty acid (VFA) production were investigated. Results showed that the solubilization and degradation of proteins can be inhibited by the presence of melanoidins. At the high-dose melanoidins, VFA production from FW was reduced by 12%. Besides, the bovine serum albumin degradation rate declined 22% with the high-dose melanoidins effectively identified their inhibition effect. However, the unaffected carbohydrates utilization led to insignificant VFA disparity at lower doses of melanoidins, because carbohydrates contributed the major VFA yield. The consumption of substrates due to melanoidins formation mainly caused VFA reduction, which contributed to 82% of substantial VFA loss. Therefore, controlling the formation of melanoidins may help the application of HT and enhance the resource recovery from FW.",

However, the integrating qualitative and quantitative approach to assess MRPs is scarce. The goal of this study was to develop a method to characterize and quantify MRPs created by HT of FW. MRPs were identified by molecular weight fractionation, indirect spectrometric indicators, and three-dimensional excitation-emission fluorescence (3DEEM) analysis. The 3DEEM method combined with fluorescence regional integration (FRI) and parallel factor (PARAFAC) analyses was able to differentiate clearly between MRPs and other dissolved organic compounds compared to other approaches. The volume of fluorescence \u03a6 from FRI and maximum fluorescence intensity  from PARAFAC were found to be suitable quantitative parameters for determination of MRPs in the hydrothermal FW system. These two parameters were validated with samples from hydrothermal FW under various operating temperatures and pH.",

In our study, effective removal of contaminants in pre-coagulated leachate membrane concentrates was achieved using the Fenton process. The Fenton process was optimized using the response surface method, and the maximum total organic carbon (TOC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and chromaticity reduction efficiencies reached 68.9%, 69.6%, and 100% under the conditions pH 2, HO concentration 1mol/L, and Fe concentration 17.5mmol/L. The COD concentration was reduced from 1120 to 340mg/L. The HO concentration was the key factor affecting the TOC removal efficiency. Slow, continuous addition of the Fenton reagents improved the HO utilization rate, which improved the TOC removal efficiency. Fourier-transform infrared and three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy showed that the majority compound of the removed organic material was humic acid. Our study provides guidelines for the treatment of leachate membrane concentrates in engineering applications.",

        "abstract": "This study reports a high-performance 3D stainless-steel photoanode (3D SS photoanode) for bioelectrochemical systems (BESs). The 3D SS photoanode consists of 3D carbon-coated SS felt bioactive side and a flat \u03b1-FeO-coated SS plate photoactive side. Without light illumination, the electrode reached a current density of 26.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.9 A m, which was already one of the highest current densities reported thus far. Under illumination, the current density of the electrode was further increased to 46.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.9 A m. The mechanism of the photo-enhanced current production can be attributed to the reduced charge-transfer resistance between electrode surface and the biofilm with illumination. It was also found that long-term light illumination can enhance the biofilm formation on the 3D SS photoanode. These findings demonstrate that using the synergistic effect of photocatalysis and microbial electrocatalysis is an efficient way to boost the current production of the existing high-performance 3D anodes for BESs.",

In this study, we propose a new application of the sewage sludge-derived carbon (SSC) as an electrode without binder in microbial fuel cells (MFCs). SS was firstly converted into SSC monoliths by methane chemical vapor method at different temperature (600, 800, 1000 or 1200\u00b0C). Scanning electron microscopy images showed that carbon micro-wires were present on the surfaces of the samples prepared at 1000 and 1200\u00b0C. The results showed that it was beneficial for converting sludge into a highly conductive electrode and increasing carbon content of the electrode at higher temperatures, thereby improving the current generation. The conductivity results show that a higher temperature favors the conversion of sludge into a highly conductive electrode. The MFC using an SSC anode processed at 1200\u00b0C generated the maximum power density of 2228mWm and the maximum current density of 14.2Am. This value was 5 times greater than that generated by an MFC equipped with a graphite anode. These results present a promising means of converting SS into electrode materials.",

However, few inexpensive high-performance anode materials for MFCs exist. In this study, MFC anodes composed of sewage sludge and different contents of fly ash (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%) are fabricated via a one-step carbonization method. The maximum current density of 25.5\u202fA\u202fm is achieved using the electrode with 20% fly ash, which is 37.5% higher than that of the electrode without fly ash. The improved anode performance is attributed to its good hydrophilicity, which is indicated by its water contact angle of less than 60\u00b0, facile adsorption of exoelectrogens, low electron transfer resistance, and good biocompatibility. In addition, the mechanical strength of the electrode with 20% fly ash is approximately 18 times that of the electrode without fly ash. This study reveals a promising method to fabricate high-performance MFC anodes and sheds light on the future development of MFCs using abundant municipal solid waste products.",

        "abstract": "The concept of photocatalytic CO2 conversion provides simultaneous solutions for global warming mitigation and fuels generation, which, however, is limited by the unsatisfactory photoconversion efficiency. Despite light harvesting and charge separation, enhancing adsorption of CO2 via surface modification could be an efficient way to improve CO2 photoconversion efficiency. Herein, we doped nonpolar carbon quantum dots (denoted as CQDs) on g-C3N4 to construct a metal-free heterojunction photocatalyst (denoted as CQDs/g-C3N4). Besides the narrow bandgap and electron-withdrawing of CQDs to improve the visible-light absorption and photocarrier separation efficiency, we first discovered that nonpolar CQDs could simultaneously improve adsorption of nonpolar CO2, photoinduced H2, enhancing the reaction kinetics and altering CO2 photoreduction pathways to generate CH4. Consequently, in contrast to g-C3N4 that only generated CO and H2, CQDs/g-C3N4 could generate 6-times CO and comparable CH4 without detectable H2 under the same conditions. Therefore, this study first demonstrated the promising nonpolar surface modification strategy for efficient CO2 adsorption, activation, and subsequent photoreduction.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Titanium is under consideration as a potential stable bio-anode because of its high conductivity, suitable mechanical properties, and electrochemical inertness in the operating potential window of bio-electrochemical systems; however, its application is limited by its poor electron-transfer capacity with electroactive bacteria and weak ability to form biofilms on its hydrophobic surface. This study reports an effective and low-cost way to convert a hydrophobic titanium alloy surface into a hydrophilic surface that can be used as a bio-electrode with higher electron-transfer rates. Pyrolytic gas of sewage sludge is used to modify the titanium alloy. The current generation, anodic biofilm formation surface, and hydrophobicity are systematically investigated by comparing bare electrodes with three modified electrodes. Maximum current density (15.80 A/m 2 ), achieved using a modified electrode, is 316-fold higher than that of the bare titanium alloy electrode (0.05 A/m 2 ) and that achieved by titanium alloy electrodes modified by other methods (12.70 A/m 2 ). The pyrolytic gas-modified titanium alloy electrode can be used as a high-performance and scalable bio-anode for bio-electrochemical systems because of its high electron-transfer rates, hydrophilic nature, and ability to achieve high current density.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Green waste (GW), rich in cellulose and hemicellulose, is a valuable resource. Developing alternative sustainable technologies to utilize GW is attracting increasing attention. In this study, microwave hydrothermal carbonization (MHTC) process parameters including holding temperature, holding time, and liquid-to-solid ratio were optimized by a response surface design to tailor the properties of hydrochar. The hydrochar characteristic was mainly evaluated by the calorific value. The results showed that the highest hydrochar calorific value (\u223c23.01\u202fMJ\u202fkg \u22121 ) could be observed at a holding temperature of 190\u202f\u00b0C, a holding time of 1\u202fh and liquid-to-solid ratio of 8:1. Correspondingly, the hydrochar yield ranged from 50.40% to 76.80%. The economic evaluation of hydrochar was also done in this work. These results show that the GW-derived hydrochar warrants further investigations as a fuel source and as an adsorbent material.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, we construct a scalable tubular single-chamber microbial electrolysis cell that using negative pressure (40.52\u00a0kPa) to enhance the hydrogen production. The impact of negative pressure on current production, hydrogen recovery, and microbial community of microbial electrolysis cells are investigated. Negative pressure could effectively enhance the hydrogen recovery and inhibit the growth of methanogens. Consequently, the microbial electrolysis cell operated under negative pressure achieves a maximum hydrogen production rate of 7.72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06\u00a0L\u00a0L \u22121 \u00a0d \u22121 , which is more than four times higher that of reactor running under normal pressure (1.51\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.41\u00a0L\u00a0L \u22121 \u00a0d \u22121 ). Energy quantification shows that the electrical energy recovery under negative pressure is 146.98%, which is much higher than 95.00% under normal pressure. Therefore, negative pressure control is as effective for increasing hydrogen production and energy recovery in the scalable MEC, and has a great practical application prospect. However, negative pressure cannot knick out methanogens. Once negative pressure is removed, methanogens will quickly take over and after that applying negative pressure again can only partly inhibit methane production.",

Here, we describe the mutational and phenotypic spectrum of PAHD in a cohort of 420 patients from neonatal screening between 1999 and 2016. The observed phenotypes comprised 43.57% classic phenylketonuria, 33.10% mild PKU, and 23.33% mild hyperphenylalaninemia, with an overall PAHD incidence of 1 in 20,445. Genetic testing was performed for 209 patients and 72 variants including seven novel variants were identified. These included two synonymous and five pathogenic nonsynonymous variants (p.S36*, p.T186I, p.L255W, p.F302V and p.R413H). The most common variant among all patients was p.R243Q, followed by p.R241C, p.Y204C, p.R111* and c.442-1G\u2009>\u2009A. Variants p.R53H and p.F392I occurred only in MHP with 19.3% and 8.0% of the observed alleles respectively. The genotypes p.[R241C];[R243Q], p.[R243Q];[R243Q], and p.[Y204C];[R243Q] were abundant across all PAHD patients. The distributions of the null allele and the three defined genotypes, null/null, null/missense, and missense/missense, were significantly different between the cPKU and mPKU patients. However, no significant differences were found between mPKU and MHP patients, indicating that other modifier factors influence the phenotypic outcome in these patients. The data presented here will provide a valuable tool for improved genetic counseling and management of future cases of PAHD in China.",

        "abstract": "Liver metastases develop in more than half of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and are associated with a poor prognosis. The factors influencing liver metastasis of CRC are poorly characterized, but this information is urgently needed. We have now discovered that small extracellular vesicles (sEVs, exosomes) derived from CRC can be specifically targeted to liver tissue and induce liver macrophage polarization toward an interleukin-6 (IL-6)-secreting pro-inflammatory phenotype. More importantly, we found that microRNA-21-5p (miR-21) was highly enriched in CRC-derived sEVs and was essential for creating a liver pro-inflammatory phenotype and liver metastasis of CRC. Silencing either miR-21 in CRC-sEVs or Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) in macrophages, to which miR-21 binds, abolished CRC-sEVs' induction of pro-inflammatory macrophages. Furthermore, miR-21 expression in plasma-derived sEVs was positively correlated with liver metastasis in CRC patients. Collectively, our data demonstrate a pivotal role of CRC-sEVs in promoting liver metastasis by inducing an inflammatory pre-metastatic niche through the miR-21-TLR7-IL6 axis. Thus, sEVs-miR-21 represents a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target for CRC patients with liver metastasis.",

        "abstract": "Liver metastases develop in more than half of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and indicate a poor prognosis. In this study, we aim to investigate CRC-derived small extracellular vesicles (CRC-sEVs) participating in liver-specific metastasis. Fluorescence-labeled CRC-sEVs were found to accumulate in macrophages in mouse liver and prime macrophage polarization toward an interleukin-6 (IL-6)-secreting pro-inflammatory phenotype (macrophage expresses different programs in response to different microenvironmental signals called macrophage polarization). By analyzing miRNA expression profiles of the CRC-sEVs and their parental cells (SW480 and SW620), we identified miR-21-5p (miR-21) as the top ranked miRNA that was highly upregulated both in the sEVs and their parental CRC cells. The majority of macrophage-secreted inflammatory signaling pathways are activated by Toll-like receptor (TLR). Macrophages treated with miR-21 analogs exhibited enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. Silencing either miR-21 in CRC-sEVs, or the Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) in macrophages which miR-21 binds to, abolished the effect of CRC-sEVs in inducing pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization. Upon intravenous injection, CRC-sEVs promoted miR-21 expression and macrophage infiltration in the mouse liver, followed by the up-regulation of inflammatory genes. Accordingly, the multiplicity of liver metastases was increased upon transplantation of CRC cells in mice treated with CRC-sEVs. Furthermore, miR-21 expression in plasma-derived sEVs positively correlated with tumor stage and liver metastasis in CRC patients. Finally, co-expression of the miR-21 and IL-6 macrophages markers was observed in liver metastatic tissues from CRC patients. Together, our data point to a pivotal role of CRC-sEVs in inducing an inflammatory pre-metastatic niche through the miR-21-TLR7-IL6 axis. Moreover, sEVs-miR-21 represents a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target for CRC patients with liver metastasis.   Citation Format:  Yingkuan Shao, Ting Chen, Xi Zheng, Shu Zheng.

        "abstract": "Abstract Mining relationships between microbes and the environment they live in are crucial to understand the intrinsic mechanisms that govern cycles of carbon, nitrogen and energy in a microbial community. Building upon next-generation sequencing technology, the selective capture of 16S rRNA genes has enabled the study of co-occurrence patterns of microbial species from the viewpoint of complex networks, yielding successful descriptions of phenomena exhibited in a microbial community. However, since the effects of such environmental factors as temperature or soil conditions on microbes are complex, reliance on the analysis of co-occurrence networks alone cannot elucidate such complicated effects underlying microbial communities. In this study, we apply a statistical method, which is called Boolean implications for metagenomic studies (BIMS) for extracting Boolean implications (IF-THEN relationships) to capture the effects of environmental factors on microbial species based on 16S rRNA sequencing data. We first demonstrate the power and effectiveness of BIMS through comprehensive simulation studies and then apply it to a 16S rRNA sequencing dataset of real marine microbes. Based on a total of 6,514 pairwise relationships identified at a low false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01, we construct a Boolean implication network between operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and environmental factors. Relationships in this network are supported by literature, and, most importantly, they bring biological insights into the effects of environmental factors on microbes. We next apply BIMS to detect three-way relationships and show the possibility of using this strategy to explain more complex relationships within a microbial community.",

        "abstract": "Comparing metagenomic samples is crucial for understanding microbial communities. For different groups of microbial communities, such as human gut metagenomic samples from patients with a certain disease and healthy controls, identifying  sequences offers essential information for potential biomarker discovery. A sequence that is present, or rich, in one group, but absent, or scarce, in another group is considered \"\" in our study. Our main purpose is to discover  sequence regions between control and case groups as disease-associated markers. We developed a long -mer ( \u2265 30 bps)-based computational pipeline to detect  sequences at strain resolution free from reference sequences, sequence alignments, and metagenome-wide  assembly. We called our method MetaGO:  oligonucleotide analysis for metagenomic samples. An open-source pipeline on  was developed with parallel computing. We applied MetaGO to one simulated and three real metagenomic datasets to evaluate the discriminative capability of identified  markers. In the simulated dataset, 99.11% of  logical -mers covered 98.89%  regions from the disease-associated strain. In addition, 97.90% of  numerical -mers covered 99.61 and 96.39% of differentially abundant genome and regions between two groups, respectively. For a large-scale metagenomic liver cirrhosis (LC)-associated dataset, we identified 37,647 mer features. Any one of the features can predict disease status of the training samples with the average of sensitivity and specificity higher than 0.8. The random forests classification using the top 10  features yielded a higher AUC (from \u223c0.8 to \u223c0.9) than that of previous studies. All mers were present in LC patients, but not healthy controls. All the assembled 11  sequences can be mapped to two strains of : UTDB1-3 and DSM2008. The experiments on the other two real datasets related to Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Type 2 Diabetes in Women consistently demonstrated that MetaGO achieved better prediction accuracy with fewer features compared to previous studies. The experiments showed that MetaGO is a powerful tool for identifying -mers, which would be clinically applicable for disease prediction. MetaGO is available at https://github.com/VVsmileyx/MetaGO.",

In the present work, we asked whether such variation or similarity could be measured and, if so, whether the results could be used for personal microbiome identification (PMI). To address this question, we herein propose a method to estimate the significance of similarity among human gut metagenomic samples based on reference-free, long -mer features. Using these features, we find that pairwise similarities between the metagenomes of any two individuals obey a beta distribution and that a  value derived accordingly well characterizes whether two samples are from the same individual or not. We develop a computational framework called GePMI (Generating inter-individual similarity distribution for Personal Microbiome Identification) and apply it to several human gut metagenomic datasets (>300 individuals and >600 samples in total). From the results of GePMI, most of the human gut microbiomes can be identified (auROC\u2009=\u20090.9470, auPRC\u2009=\u20090.8702). Even after antibiotic treatment or fecal microbiota transplantation, the individual -mer signature still maintains a certain specificity.",

To account for these problems, we propose metagenomic Lognormal-Dirichlet-Multinomial (mLDM), a hierarchical Bayesian model with sparsity constraints, to estimate absolute microbial abundance and simultaneously infer both conditionally dependent associations among microbes and direct associations between microbes and environmental factors. We empirically show the effectiveness of the mLDM model using synthetic data, data from the TARA Oceans project, and a colorectal cancer dataset. Finally, we apply mLDM to 16S sequencing data from the western English Channel and report several associations. Our model can be used on both natural environmental and human metagenomic datasets, promoting the understanding of associations in the microbial community.",

        "abstract": "Understanding of the bacterial community structure in drinking water resources helps to enhance the security of municipal water supplies. In this study, bacterial communities were surveyed in water and sediment during a heavy cyanobacterial bloom in a drinking water resource of Lake Taihu, China. A total of 325,317 high-quality sequences were obtained from different 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) regions (V3, V4, and V6) using the Miseq sequencing platform. A notable difference was shown between the water and sediment samples, as predominated by Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria in the water and Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Verrucomicrobia in the sediment, respectively. The LD12 family dominated the water surface and was tightly associated with related indicators of cyanobacterial propagation, indicating involvement in the massive proliferation of cyanobacterial blooms. Alternatively, the genus Nitrospira dominated the sediment samples, which indicates that nitrite oxidation was very active in the sediment. Although pathogenic bacteria were not detected in a large amount, some genera such as Mycobacterium, Acinetobacter, and Legionella were still identified but in very low abundance. In addition, the effects of different V regions on bacterial diversity survey were evaluated. Overall, V4 and V3 were proven to be more promising V regions for bacterial diversity survey in water and sediment samples during heavy water blooms in Lake Taihu, respectively. As longer, cheaper, and faster DNA sequencing technologies become more accessible, we expect that bacterial community structures based on 16S rRNA amplicons as an indicator could be used alongside with physical and chemical indicators, to conduct comprehensive assessments for drinking water resource management.",

We report the cultivation of Candidatus Nitrosomarinus catalina SPOT01, a novel strain that is less warm-temperature tolerant than other cultivated Thaumarchaeota. Using metagenomic recruitment, strain SPOT01 comprises a major portion of Thaumarchaeota (4-54%) in temperate Pacific waters. Its complete 1.36 Mbp genome possesses several distinguishing features: putative phosphorothioation (PT) DNA modification genes; a region containing probable viral genes; and putative urea utilization genes. The PT modification genes and an adjacent putative restriction enzyme (RE) operon likely form a restriction modification (RM) system for defence from foreign DNA. PacBio sequencing showed >98% methylation at two motifs, and inferred PT guanine modification of 19% of possible TGCA sites. Metagenomic recruitment also reveals the putative virus region and PT modification and RE genes are present in 18-26%, 9-14% and <1.5% of natural populations at 150 m with \u226585% identity to strain SPOT01. The presence of multiple probable RM systems in a highly streamlined genome suggests a surprising importance for defence from foreign DNA for dilute populations that infrequently encounter viruses or other cells. This new strain provides new insights into the ecology, including viral interactions, of this important group of marine microbes.",

        "abstract": "In aquatic ecosystems, both phytoplankton and bacteria play pivotal roles. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, considerable research focused on phytoplankton colony attached and free-living bacteria has revealed the close relationship between them, and indicated that the entire bacterial community mediates crucial biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems. However, our understanding of their distribution patterns and response to environmental factors remains poor. Besides, picocyanobacteria, which were omitted from attached bacteria analysis, were reported to be important in cyanobacterial blooms. To explore the spatiotemporal variation of the entire bacterial community with their driving environmental factors and detect the relationships among them, we collected 61 water samples spanning one year and the entire Lake Taihu regions for surveying the entire bacterial community. Our results indicated: 1) seasonal variation of the bacterial community composition was stronger than spatial variation due to the clearly seasonal variation of Microcystis, Synechococcus (pico-cyanobacteria) and other bacteria (Actinomycetales, Pirellulaceae and Sphingobacteriaceae); 2) the spatial distribution of the bacterial community showed that different phyla were dominant in different regions; 3) the bacterial co-occurrence networks varied seasonally and were dominated by Microcystis, ACK-M1, Chthoniobacteraceae, Synechococcus, Pirellulaceae and Pelagibacteraceae; 4) phytoplankton density, chlorophyll a, water temperature and total nitrogen were the major factors that drove the spatiotemporal variation of bacterial community composition. This study revealed the seasonal succession and spatial distribution of the entire bacterial community in Lake Taihu, providing new insights into the relationship between water bloom-forming cyanobacterial species and other bacteria, and their response to environmental factors in eutrophic freshwater ecosystem.",

        "abstract": "Interpretive analysis of metagenomic data depends on an understanding of the underlying associations among microbes from metagenomic samples.Although several statistical tools have been developed for metagenomic association studies, they suffer from compositional bias or fail to take into account environmental factors that directly affect the composition of a given microbial community. In this paper, we propose metagenomic Lognormal-Dirichlet-Multinomial (mLDM), a hierarchical Bayesian model with sparsity constraints to bypass compositional bias and discover new associations among microbes and between microbes and environmental factors. The mLDM model can 1) infer both conditionally dependent associations among microbes and direct associations between microbes and environmental factors; 2) consider both compositional bias and variance of metagenomic data; and 3) estimate absolute abundance for microbes. Thus, conditionally dependent association can capture direct relationship underlying microbial pairs and remove the indirect connections induced from other common factors. Empirical studies show the effectiveness of the mLDM model, using both synthetic data and the TARA Oceans eukaryotic data by comparing it with several state-of-the-art methodologies. Finally, mLDM is applied to western English Channel data and finds some interesting associations.",

        "abstract": "Padua linear model is widely used for the risk assessment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which is a common and preventable complication for inpatients. However, differences of race, genetics and environment between Western and Chinese population limit Padua model' validity in Chinese patients. Extracting VTE risk factors from unstructured medical records in Chinese hospital can help to understand VTE events and develop efficient risk assessment model. In this study, we proposed an ontology-based method to mine VTE risk factors combining natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) methods. Medical records of 3106 inpatients were processed and terms in multiple ontologies from various sections of records enriched in VTE patients were sorted automatically. Then ML methods were used to estimate terms' importance and terms within admitting diagnosis and progress notes showed better VTE prediction performance than other sections. Finally a novel VTE prediction model was built based on selected terms and showed higher AUC score (0.815) than the Padua model (0.789).",

This is the first investigation on the association between traditional tongue diagnosis and the tongue coating microbiome using next-generation sequencing. The study included 19 gastritis patients with a typical white-greasy or yellow-dense tongue coating corresponding to TCM Cold or Hot Syndrome respectively, as well as eight healthy volunteers. An Illumina paired-end, double-barcode 16S rRNA sequencing protocol was designed to profile the tongue-coating microbiome, from which approximately 3.7 million V6 tags for each sample were obtained. We identified 123 and 258 species-level OTUs that were enriched in patients with Cold/Hot Syndromes, respectively, representing \"Cold Microbiota\" and \"Hot Microbiota\". We further constructed the tongue microbiota-imbalanced networks associated with Cold/Hot Syndromes. The results reveal an important connection between the tongue-coating microbiome and traditional tongue diagnosis, and illustrate the potential of the tongue-coating microbiome as a novel holistic biomarker for characterizing patient subtypes.",

Tandem mass spectrometry selects and fragments peptides of interest into N-terminal ions and C-terminal ions, and it measures the mass/charge ratios of these ions. The de novo peptide sequencing problem is to derive the peptide sequences from given tandem mass spectral data of k ion peaks without searching against protein databases. By transforming the spectral data into a matrix spectrum graph G = (V, E), where |V| = O(k(2)) and |E| = O(k(3)), we give the first polynomial time suboptimal algorithm that finds all the suboptimal solutions (peptides) in O(p|E|) time, where p is the number of solutions. The algorithm has been implemented and tested on experimental data. The program is available at http://hto-c.usc.edu:8000/msms/menu/denovo.htm.",

        "abstract": "Comparing metagenomic samples is crucial for understanding microbial communities. For different groups of microbial communities, such as human gut metagenomics samples from patients with a certain disease and healthy controls, identifying group-specific sequences offers essential information for potential biomarker discovery. A sequence that is present, or rich, in one group, but absent, or scarce, in another group is considered \u201cgroup-specific\u201d in our study. Our main purpose is to discover group-specific sequence regions between control and case groups as disease-associated markers. We developed a long k-mer (k u003e= 30 bps) based computational pipeline to detect group-specific sequences at strain resolution free from reference sequences, sequence alignments and metagenome-wide de novo assembly. We called our method MetaGO: Group-specific Oligonucleotide analysis for Metagenomic samples. An open-source pipeline on Apache Spark was developed with parallel computing. We applied MetaGO to one simulated and three real metagenomic datasets to evaluate the discriminative capability of identified group-specific markers. In the simulated dataset, 98.91% of group-specific logical 40-mers covered 98.89% disease-specific regions from the disease-associated strain. In addition, 98.83% of group-specific numerical 40-mers covered 99.01% and 97.30% of differential-abundant genome and regions between two groups, respectively. For a large-scale metagenomic Liver Cirrhosis (LC)-associated dataset. We identified 37,647 group-specific 40-mer features. Any one of the features can predict disease status of the training samples with average of sensitivity and specificity higher than 0.8. The random forests classification using the top 10 group-specific features yielded a higher AUC (from ~0.8 to ~0.9) than that of previous studies. All group-specific 40-mers were present in LC patients, but not healthy controls. All the assembled 11 LC-specific sequences can be mapped to two strains of Veillonella parvula: UTDB1-3 and DSM2008. The experiments on the other two real datasets, Inflammatory Bowel Disease-associated and Type 2 Diabetes in Women-associated, consistently demonstrated that MetaGO achieved better prediction accuracy with fewer features compared with previous studies. The experiments showed that MetaGO is a powerful tool for identifying group-specific k-mers, and these features accurately predict disease status using a single k-mer or only a few k-mers, which would be clinically applicable for disease prediction.",

        "title": "Maternal Glucocorticoid Elevation and Associated Fetal Thymocyte Apoptosis are Involved in Immune Disorders of Prenatal Caffeine Exposed Offspring Mice.",
        "abstract": "Our previous study showed that prenatal caffeine exposure (PCE) could induce intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and glucocorticoid elevation in the fetus. Researchers suggested that IUGR is a risk factor for T helper cell (Th)1/Th2 deviation. However, whether PCE can induce these immune disorders and the underlying mechanisms of that induction remain unknown. This study aimed to observe the effects of PCE on the Th1/Th2 balance in offspring and further explore the developmental origin mechanisms from the perspective of glucocorticoid overexposure-induced thymocyte apoptosis. An IUGR model was established by caffeine administration from gestational day (GD) 9 to GD 18, and the offspring were immunized on postnatal day (PND) 42. The results show that maternal glucocorticoid overexposure increased fetal thymocyte apoptosis by activating both the Fas-mediated and the Bim-regulated apoptotic pathways. After birth, accelerated thymocyte apoptosis and Th1 suppression were also found in the PCE offspring at PND 14 and PND 49. Moreover, the PCE offspring showed immune disorders after immunization, manifesting as increased IgG1/IgG2a ratio and IL-4 production in the serum. In conclusion, PCE could induce fetal overexposure to maternal glucocorticoids and increase thymocyte apoptosis, which could persist into postnatal life and be implicated in Th1 inhibition and further immune disorders.",

        "abstract": "This study was designed to observe the effects of maternal food restriction (MFR) on the development of fetal thymus in different gestation periods. Timed pregnant rats were randomized into 3 groups: CN (free access to standard chow throughout gestation), MFR (50% MFR throughout gestation), MFR (50% MFR from gestational day (GD) 0 to GD14, early-mid gestation). Results showed that MFR during early-mid period had few impact on the fetal thymus and T cell subpopulations. However, MFR throughout gestation resulted in thymic atrophy, deceased frequency of both CD4 and CD8 single positive (SP) T cells and enhanced thymocyte apoptosis in fetus. Our results suggest the fetal thymus is more vulnerable to the adverse intrauterine environments in the late gestation period, and the decreased number of SP T cells could result from the enhanced thymocyte apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Caffeine is contained within many drinks and food that are consumed daily. Prenatal caffeine ingestion (PCI) is a risk factor for intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). We previously observed that PCI inhibits scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI)-mediated cholesterol uptake in fetal adrenals, subsequently decreasing glucocorticoid synthesis and inducing IUGR. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the long-term effects of PCI on adrenal glucocorticoid synthesis in adult male offspring rats. After establishing the PCI-induced IUGR, adult male offspring was injected intraperitoneally with 5 mg/kg\u00b7d lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 2 days to induce acute stress. We observed persistent inhibition of SR-BI expression in PCI adrenals before and after stress. Compared with the controls, the PCI offspring had higher corticosterone concentrations after stress. The serum cholesterol concentration was stable without intergroup differences before and after stress. The cholesterol concentration in PCI adrenals showed a higher decrease rate than that of the control after stress. In summary, PCI induced long-term alterations in SR-BI expression and glucocorticoid synthesis in adult male offspring rat adrenals. Cholesterol has to be over-consumed in PCI adrenals against acute stress. This study provides an experimental basis to explain the susceptibility of IUGR offspring to metabolic diseases in adults.",

        "abstract": "Immunity is a balanced status with adequate biological defenses to recognize and fight \u201cnon-self\u201d, as well as adequate tolerance to recognize \u201cself\u201d. To maintain this immune homeostasis, a well-organized T cell immune network is required, which in part depends on the well-controlled development of alternative effector T cells, with different cytokine repertoires. Recent research has pointed that developing fetal T cells network is a remarkably sensitive toxicological target for adverse factors in early life. Epidemiological and experimental studies showed an inseparable relationship between T cell developmental toxicity and immune diseases in adults. Considering that the inflammatory and immune disorders have become a growing health problem worldwide, increasing attention is now being paid to the T cell developmental toxicity. We propose that adverse factors may have programming effects on the crucial functions of immune system during early life which is critical for fetal T cell development and the establishment of the distinct T cell repertoires balance. The permanently disturbed intrathymic or peripheral T cell development may in turn lead to the immune disorders and risk of immune diseases in later life.In this manuscript, we reviewed how adverse factors affected T cell development in early-life with the consequence of the immune dysfunction and immune diseases, and further elucidate the mechanisms. These mechanisms will be helpful in prevention and treatment of the increased prevalence of immune diseases by interfering those pathways.",

        "abstract": "There is increasing evidence suggesting that maternal nicotine (NIC) exposure alone can lead to many deleterious consequences in the fetus. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of prenatal and lactation NIC exposure on glucose homeostasis, lipogenesis and lipid metabolism in mothers and pups. After maternal NIC exposure (from gestational day 9 to weaning), NIC mothers showed lower body weight, decreased parametrial white adipose tissue (pWAT) and inguinal WAT weights, lower homeostasis model assessment of beta cell function, higher serum total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, higher Castelli index values, lower hepatic mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP1c), lipoprotein lipase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase (FAS) and glucose transporters 4 (GLUT4), as well as lower SREBP1c, FAS, leptin and GLUT4 mRNA levels in pWAT. However, female NIC pups presented higher body weights and serum TC levels, and increased trends for high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and Castelli index I. Male NIC pups had higher body weight, serum TC levels and Castelli index I values, and lower glycemia levels. Additionally, hepatic and adipose FAS gene expression from the female NIC pups presented a decreasing trend, while the male NIC pups had lower hepatic FAS expression and higher adipose FAS expression. In conclusion, prenatal and lactation NIC exposure induced deleterious effects on the glucose homeostasis, lipogenesis and lipid metabolism in both mothers and pups, which may promote several important metabolic disorders in the progeny. Additionally, there are gender-specific effects on pups.",

        "abstract": "A novel dual-phase oxygen permeation membrane based on ion-conducting Ce 0.8Sm 0.2O 2-\u03b4 (SDC) and mixed conducting PrBaCo 2O 5+\u03b4 (PBCO) is presented. There is no obvious reaction between the two phases under preparation and oxygen permeation conditions. The percolative network of mixed conducting phase PBCO can be formed in SDC-PBCO composite when the ratio of PBCO is not less than 40 vol.%. Above this threshold, the oxygen permeability of SDC-PBCO membrane increases with increasing SDC content. Compared with pure PBCO membrane, the oxygen permeability of percolative SDC-PBCO composites is improved due to the 3D diffusion ability of SDC, which can shorten the tortuosity of the oxygen diffusion path in layered PBCO. The maximum oxygen flux based on 0.6-mm-thick SDC-PBCO (6/4) is 2.38 \u00d7 10 -7 mol cm -2 s -1 at 925 \u00b0C. The dependence of the oxygen permeation flux on the membrane thickness demonstrates that the bulk diffusion is the limiting step at thickness higher than 0.8 mm and the surface exchange may play an important role when the thickness is below that. Incorporation of SDC into PBCO can not only improve the oxygen permeability but also enhance the structural stability. The SDC-PBCO (6/4) dual-phase membrane is a promising candidate for oxygen separation application. \u00a9 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Amphiphilic poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers are a well-known dendritic family due to their remarkable ability to self-assemble on solid surface. However, the relationship between molecular conformation (or adsorption kinetics) of self-assembled layer and molecular amphiphilicity of such kind of dendrimer is still lacking, which limits on the development of modulating self-assembling structures and surface functionality. With this in mind, we synthesized a series of amphiphilic PAMAM-based dendrimers, denoted as G1Cn, with different alkyl chains (n=8, 12, 16), and investigated the molecular aggregation on silica surfaces by means of quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and contact angle (CA). After rinse, remaining adsorption amounts of G1C12 were higher than those of G1C8 at high concentrations, suggesting that G1C12 adlayers were more stable due to the stronger intermolecular hydrophobic interactions. Whereas it preferred to adopt the intramolecular hydrophobic interactions for G1C16, with low adsorption amounts and unstable adlayers. Bilayer-like structures were inferred in G1C8 and G1C12 adlayers with loose conformation, while monolayer structures were likely to exist in the sparse adsorption film of G1C16. Our results provided more detailed understanding of the effect of molecular structure on the self-assembled structures of amphiphilic dendrimers on solid surfaces, shedding light on the controlled microstructure and wettability of functional surface by modulating the length of hydrophobic chains of dendrimers and a potential application of dendrimer-substrate combinations.",

        "abstract": "Current approaches to dealing with the worldwide problem of marine biofouling are to impart chemical functionality to the surface or utilize microtopography inspired by nature. Previous reports have shown that only introducing a single method may not resist adhesion of mussels or inhibit biofouling in static forms. While it is promising to integrate two methods to develop an effective antifouling strategy, related basic research is still lacking. Here, we have fabricated engineered shark skin surfaces with different feature heights and terminated with different chemical moieties. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) with a modified colloid probe technique and quartz crystal microbalance with a dissipation n (QCM-D) monitoring method have been introduced to directly determine the interactions between adhesive proteins and functionalized surfaces. Our results indicate that the adhesion strength of probe-surface decreases with increasing feature height, and it also decreases from bare Si surface to alkyl and hydroxyl modification, which is attributed to different contact area domains and interaction mechanisms. Combining biomimetic microtopography and surface chemistry, our study provides a new perspective for designing and developing underwater anti-fouling materials.",

Cationic amphiphilic polymer has been proposed to be a new generation of efficient antibacterial material, but the surface modified by such kind of polymer still shows incomplete bactericidal ability and easily contaminated performance. With this in mind, a novel kind of geminized cationic amphiphilic polymer brush surface has been developed in this study, presenting a complete antibacterial activity, due to the synergistic biocidal effect of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions as well as the minimized contact area between bacteria and polymer surface. A structure self-adjustment process of polymer brush construction has been proposed, in which the mutual interference among cationic head groups can be avoided and the electrostatic repulsion and hydrophobic attraction can be balanced, in the formation of a smooth and tight surface. A self-cleaning capability of polymer surface has been carried out via hydrolysis and degradation, maintaining a high antibacterial activity. Therefore, we provide a facile and possible manipulation strategy to fabricate super-antibacterial and self-cleaning surfaces in a wide range of biomedical and industrial applications.",

It was also found that the electrostatic force had a great effect on this process due to the interactions between the charged interfaces of oil/water and water/solid.

        "abstract": "The adhesion of mussel foot proteins (Mfps) to a variety of surfaces has been widely investigated, but the mechanisms behind the mussel adhesion to surfaces with different properties are far from being understood. Most of Mfps contain a significant amount of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) which is considered to be responsible for the strong wet adhesion. In the present work, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) were prepared as a series of model surfaces with variable functional groups. DOPA-surface interactions were investigated using chemical force microscopy (CFM) for the first time, in which an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip was chemically modified with DOPA terminated groups. The ability of DOPA to adhere to different surfaces with variable wettability was compared, showing that DOPA behaves with the strongest and weakest adhesion to C6H5- and OH-terminated surfaces, respectively. The interaction strength of DOPA at different surfaces does not always increase with the increase of surface wettability, because the hydrophobic interaction does not play a decisive role in DOPA adhering to surfaces. By the use of classical and extended Derjaguin\u2013Landau\u2013Verwey\u2013Overbeek (DLVO) theories, the contribution of non-DLVO forces was isolated. We found out DOPA can adhere to each surface functional group, since DOPA residues containing o-hydroxy or aromatic rings alone can control the adhesion process, and the aromatic ring is oriented perpendicularly or parallel to the surface. This study served as a basis for understanding the relationship between DOPA adhesion mechanisms and different wet surfaces, representing important concepts for the design of bioadhesive materials and anti-adhesion surfaces.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Low salinity effect has been in the center of attention as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly technique. Wettability alteration of the oil/brine/mica system appears to be the identified mechanism(s) to trigger the low salinity effect. While the effect of water chemistry and minerology on the wettability of the system has been extensively investigated, few studies have investigated the effect of specific function groups from crude oil on the system wettability, limiting the understanding of how specific functional group contributes to the wettability. We thus experimentally measured the adhesion forces between mica surfaces and functional groups (e.g., C 6 H 5 \u2013, CH 3 \u2013, COOH\u2013, and NH 2 \u2013) in the presence of different aqueous ionic solutions using chemical force microscopy (CFM). Moreover, to understand the contribution of the structural force, the traditional Derjaguin\u2013Landau\u2013Verwey\u2013Overbeek (DLVO) theory was extended (denoted as EDLVO) to fit the force profiles using a Gauss model. Our results showed that the adhesion force between mica and functional groups in a decreasing order was \u2013NH 2 \u00a0u003e\u00a0\u2013COOH u003e\u00a0\u2013CH 3 \u00a0u003e\u00a0\u2013C 6 H 5 . We also found that while DLVO forces strongly affected the tip-surface contact due to the interactions among oil/brine/mica interfaces, the structural forces also played an important role in a distance of 1\u201320\u00a0nm due to the presence of H-bonds between COOH-terminated or NH 2 -terminated tip and mica surface. We therefore conclude that the structural force largely contributes to the adhesion force due to the hydrophilicity or polarity of functional groups, and nucleophilic property (such as phenyl group). Our results suggest that the polarity of the crude oil needs to be considered to screen a candidate reservoir for low salinity water flooding projects.",

        "abstract": "Mussel adhesion to a variety of surfaces has received considerable attention due to its ability to bind strongly to many surfaces under water. Understanding the interactions between mussel-derived adhesive proteins and surfaces with different chemical and physical properties is of great theoretical and practical interest. Here, we explored the adsorption behavior of mussel foot protein-1 (Mfp-1) onto self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with varying wettability and chemistry, through quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation measurements, ellipsometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The results showed significant differences in the structural conformations of protein adsorbed layers for the series of surfaces. Two mechanisms were found in all the systems; in the case of hydrophobic surfaces, the first regime corresponded to the initial adsorption of protein molecules onto the surfaces, and the second kinetic process was related to conformational changes, resulting in a relatively rigid and dense protein layer; while for hydrophilic surfaces, a loose and soft adsorbed protein film was generated. It was found that the adsorbed mass of Mfp-1 at the hydroxyl terminated SAM surface was the smallest among all the modified surfaces, because of the formation of hydration layers reducing protein adhesion effectively. Furthermore, the interaction mechanisms of protein molecules with solid surfaces were suggested, providing a new way of designing and developing underwater adhesive or anti-fouling materials.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The adhesion forces between model chemical moieties of oil molecules (CH 3 \u2013, C 6 H 5 \u2013, COOH\u2013, and NH 2 \u2013) and quartz surfaces with different wettability were investigated by the aid of chemical force microscopy at low and high salinity (10\u202fmM and 100\u202fmM). Our results showed that the adhesion force on hydrophilic surfaces decreased as in the order: \u2013NH 2 \u202fu003e\u202f\u2013COOH\u202fu003e\u202f\u2013C 6 H 5 \u202f\u2248\u202f\u2013CH 3 , due to the contribution of hydrogen bonding interactions between polar groups of functionalized tips and Si-OH groups of quartz surfaces. By comparison, the adhesion force decreased almost in an opposite order: \u2013CH 3 \u202fu003e\u202f\u2013C 6 H 5 \u202fu003e\u202f\u2013COOH\u202f\u2248\u202f\u2013NH 2 , in the case of hydrophobic surfaces, attributed to the strong trend of hydrophobic interactions between nonpolar oil groups and hydrophobic surface (modified with alkyl chains). A high potential of low salinity effect on improving oil recovery can be found in polar oil system in the presence of hydrophilic surfaces, as well as in nonpolar oil system in the presence of hydrophobic surfaces, because of the significantly reduced adhesion forces from high to low salinity environment. Thus it can be concluded that for hydrophilic reservoirs, the low salinity effect may be remarkable in the case of crude oil containing more polar components. And for hydrophobic reservoirs, crude oil with more nonpolar components would exhibit a significant low salinity effect. All these provide a better understanding in the molecular level for low salinity water flooding applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Although nano \u201cgreen\u201d coatings with excellent corrosion resistance have attracted great attention, the inhibition efficiency is still limited due to the lack of knowledge about the correlation between molecular structure and anticorrosion performance. Here, we fabricated a series of 3,4-dihydroxy- l -phenylalanine adlayers on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with varying end groups. We found that both NH 2   and CF 3  SAMs were more conducive to the adsorption of DOPA and a flat adsorption conformation was preferentially adopted, with the plane of the phenylene ring parallel to the surface  via  cation-\u03c0 interactions or hydrophobic interactions, leading to a compact and dense adlayer. Such DOPA-SAM multilayers can effectively protect the substrate from corrosion by suppressing the diffusion of aggressive water and acid molecules as well as the electrodissolution of metals. The lowest corrosion current of adlayers reaches 6.96\u00a0\u03bcA\u00a0cm \u22122  which is much lower than that of bare substrate and other anticorrosion surfaces reported previously. The results provide guidance on the design of green anticorrosion materials  via  selecting SAMs that bridge organic and metal interface.",

The results showed that asphaltenes were displaced by PASBn even at a low concentration of 0.5 g/L, mainly attributed to the electrostatic, polar, and hydrophobic interactions between asphaltenes and PASBn, as well as the electrostatic interactions between PASBn and binding sites of the solid surface.

        "abstract": "Abstract Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators of eukaryotic gene expression, and have been shown to regulate various modular components of development and differentiation. However, the roles of lncRNA in the regulation of the osteogenic differentiation of human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) remain poorly understood. The expression patterns of lncRNA and mRNA during osteogenic differentiation were profiled using microarray analysis. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to validate the microarray data. The biological functions of candidates were revealed by cluster analysis as well as by Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analyses. Coding-noncoding gene co-expression (CNC) networks were constructed to investigate the potential regulatory roles of lncRNAs and osteogenesis-related mRNAs. We found that 3557 mRNAs and 2171 lncRNAs were differentially expressed after osteoinduction, of which 994 lncRNAs were up-regulated and 1177 were down-regulated (fold change u003e2.0 or",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Background/purpose  Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), as a conventional molecular technique, was utilized to analyze the diversity of oral microbiota. However, studies found that the results of PCR-DGGE were affected by the DNA isolation method. This study compared QIAamp DNA Micro Kit extraction method with the phenol and chloroform extraction method for DNA isolation of saliva of healthy youths and analyzed PCR-DGGE fingerprints.    Materials and methods  In the first stage, samples were divided into two after collection from eight health youths. Two methods were used to isolate the DNA for PCR-DGGE analysis. In the second stage, another 16 samples were collected from 14 youths. The better method, QIAamp DNA Micro Kit, was used to isolate the DNA for PCR-DGGE analysis. The cluster analysis was performed with unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means.    Results  The results in the first stage showed that the QIAamp DNA Micro Kit extraction method was more suitable for DNA extraction of saliva than the phenol-chloroform extraction method. In the second stage, the bands were changed into numbers \u201c0\u201d, \u201c1\u201d, and \u201c2\u201d to analyze the similarity of samples according to the bandsu0027 lightness. The similarity indices of different periods from the same individual showed that the microbiological composition was very similar (u003e0.95), while those from different individuals varied greatly (    Conclusion  PCR-DGGE was more accurate in assessing oral microbial diversity by QIAamp DNA Micro Kit. Different individuals had large differences in oral microbial diversity but also had some common microbial dominant communities.",

        "abstract": "In order to use stem cells as a resource for tissue regeneration, it is necessary to induce expansion . However, during culture, stem cells often lose functional properties and become senescent. Increasing evidence indicates that hypoxic preconditioning with physiological oxygen concentration can maintain the functional properties of stem cells . The purpose of the current study was to test the hypothesis that hypoxic preconditioning with physiological oxygen concentration can maintain the functional properties of stem cells in culture by reducing oxidative stress.  studies were performed in primary human dental pulp cells (hDPCs). Reduced levels of oxidative stress and increased cellular \"stemness\" in response to physiological hypoxia were dependent upon the expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Subsequently, RNA-sequencing analysis revealed the increased expression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling in culture, a pathway which regulates oxidative stress. Furthermore, we found evidence that PI3K/Akt signaling might affect intracellular ROS production by negatively regulating expression of the downstream protein Forkhead Box Protein O1 (FOXO1) and Caspase 3. Collectively, our data show that the PI3K/Akt pathway is activated in response to hypoxia and inhibits oxidative stress in a ROS-dependent manner. This study identified redox-mediated hypoxic preconditioning regulatory mechanisms that may be significant for tissue regeneration.",

        "abstract": "Positive plant-soil feedback depends on beneficial interactions between roots and microbes for nutrient acquisition; growth promotion; and disease suppression. Recent pyrosequencing approaches have provided insight into the rhizosphere bacterial communities in various cropping systems. However; there is a scarcity of information about the influence of root exudates on the composition of root-associated bacterial communities in ratooning tea monocropping systems of different ages. In Southeastern China; tea cropping systems provide the unique natural experimental environment to compare the distribution of bacterial communities in different rhizo-compartments. High performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) was performed to identify and quantify the allelochemicals in root exudates. A high-throughput sequence was used to determine the structural dynamics of the root-associated bacterial communities. Although soil physiochemical properties showed no significant differences in nutrients; long-term tea cultivation resulted in the accumulation of catechin-containing compounds in the rhizosphere and a lowering of pH. Moreover; distinct distribution patterns of bacterial taxa were observed in all three rhizo-compartments of two-year and 30-year monoculture tea; mediated strongly by soil pH and catechin-containing compounds. These results will help to explore the reasons why soil quality and fertility are disturbed in continuous ratooning tea monocropping systems; and to clarify the associated problems.",

        "abstract": "Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most important crops in the world to feed ever increasing world population. An increase in output of rice crop per unit is imminent. Alternate wetting and moderate soil drying (AWD) irrigation technology has been recommended as a good practice method to improve grain filling of rice crop at late growing stages. Physiological, molecular and agronomic parameters were adopted to elucidate the role of rice stem and sheath under AWD treatment as compared to the conventional irrigation during the grain filling stage. AWD treatment significantly increased stem and sheath dry weight, carbohydrate reserves and their remobilization to the grain, especially inferior spikelet grains. The results showed that the transport and conversion rate of the stem and sheath photoassimilates increased by 9.87 and 8.37%, respectively. Furthermore, protein expression profiles of the stem and sheath at 10, 20 and 30 days after flowering were analyzed. We examined 220 differentially expressed proteins, and successfully identified 166 proteins, including 71 proteins in the stem and 95 proteins in the sheath involved in thirteen important functional groups. Our results suggest that the AWD treatment at the rice grain filling stage is highly conducive to trigger the mobilization of the N assimilates from leave and root to the stem and sheath, and then promotes to remobilize the reserves to the grain through coordinately expressed proteins involved in photosynthesis, systematic senescence, oxidative stress defense, signal transduction and other metabolisms. This study reveals the metabolic mechanism of the stem and sheath in response to AWD at grain filling stage, and provides theoretical evidence for better quality control and scientific improvement of rice in practice.",

        "title": "Surfactant CATB-assisted generation and gas-sensing characteristics of LnFeO3 (Ln = La, Sm, Eu) materials",
        "abstract": "Perovskite structure of LnFeO 3 (Ln = La, Sm, and Eu) oxides with uniform particle size was prepared by the cationic surfactant CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) assisting method from the inorganic precursor and alkali source (Ln\u2014chlorate, FeCl 3 and NH 4 OH). The final products were characterized and the results showed that the pure and high crystalline perovskite structure of LnFeO 3 materials were obtained after calcining at 850 \u00b0C. Gas sensors of the indirect-heating structure using LnFeO 3 as sensitive materials were fabricated on alumina tube with Au electrodes and platinum wires. The gas-sensing characteristics of LnFeO 3 to acetone, gasoline, and formaldehyde were investigated and exhibited good response properties to acetone (LaFeO 3 ), gasoline (SmFeO 3 ), and formaldehyde (EuFeO 3 ) gases, respectively. The LnFeO 3 oxides-based on gas sensors enable them to be promising candidates for the detection of the gases in monitoring environment. Keywords Surfactant CATB Perovskite structure LnFeO 3 Gas-sensing properties 1 Introduction Gas sensors based on semiconducting oxides are one of the useful instruments to monitor gases because of their high sensitivity, quick response, simple design, convenient use and low manufacturing cost. The materials such as SnO 2 , ZnO, \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 , and so on, are widely used as sensitive materials of chemical sensors to detect toxic and combustible gases. However, they still need further improvement in aspects of sensitivity and stability. In 1960s, Shaver [1] as well as Loh [2] reported that the gas sensitivity of such a device was greatly promoted by the addition of Pt, Pd, Ir or Rh. The promoting effects of noble metals have since been confirmed to appear in many combinations of metals and semiconductors [3\u20137] , and have been utilized extensively in the fabrication of practical gas-sensing devices. The demands of accurate and dedicated sensors to provide precise process control and automation in manufacturing processes, and also to monitor and control environmental pollution, have accelerated the development of new sensing materials and sensor technology in the last decade. The focus is on the development of new sensing materials to improve sensitivity, selectivity and stability of sensors and also on the development of new and better fabrication techniques to ensure reliability, safety, and reproducibility and to reduce the cost. In present review, it is found that sensors based on perovskite oxides with ABO 3 structure have an advantage of high stability at relatively high temperatures and in chemically aggressive atmospheres [8\u201312] . For this reason, perovskite-type oxide materials could be used as a new material for detecting reducing gases. ABO 3 perovskite-type oxides, with A = rare earth and B = transition metal ion, have a range of interesting electrical properties. They are very important materials to be used as catalysts [13] , fuel cells [14] , electrodes [15] and chemical gas sensors [16] . It is well known that a number of perovskite-type oxides prepared in air show p-type semiconducting properties, and their conductivity increases with the adsorption of oxidizing gas such as O 2 . On the other hand, their conductivity decreases when they were exposed to reducing gas [17] . Therefore, the change in conductivity of perovskite structure oxides is employed for the detection of different gases in atmosphere. In this paper, LnFeO 3 of perovskite-type oxides have been obtained by using surfactant CTAB-assisted method, and the final products were characterized. Gas sensors for indirect-heating based on LnFeO 3 sensing materials were fabricated. Their gas-sensing characteristics toward acetone, gasoline and formaldehyde were also investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of LnFeO 3 powders All the chemical reagents used in the experiments were obtained from Fluka as guaranteed-grade reagents and used without further purification. The purity of CTAB was 99.9% and of the inorganic precursors (FeCl 3 , LaCl 3 \u00b77H 2 O, SmCl 3 , EuCl 3 ) were not less than 99%, respectively. The LnFeO 3 of perovskite structure oxides were prepared by a surfactant-assisted method. The surfactant not only provides the favorable sites for the growth of the particulate assemblies, but it also influences the formation process, including nucleation, growth, coagulation and flocculation [18] . The process flow chart is shown in Fig. 1 . All reagents such as cationic surfactant (CTAB), lanthanide chloride (LnCl 3 ), ferric chloride (FeCl 3 ) and ammonia (NH 4 OH) were obtained from commercial sources as guaranteed-grade reagents and used without further purification. In a typical process, the synthesis procedure was as follows: LnCl 3 and FeCl 3 with mole ratio (Ln 3+ )/(Fe 3+ ) = 1:1 were first dissolved in deionized water to get solution ALF (1 mM). At the same time, the CTAB was mixed with deionized water under stirring until a homogeneous solution was obtained. A solution of diluted NH 4 OH (25 wt% solution, 15 ml) was added into the CTAB solution (0.08 M, i.e. 0.08 mol/L) under stirring. Then it was mixed homogeneously to obtain solution BNC. Subsequently, the solution ALF was added into the solution BNC and the mixture was stirred vigorously before being aged at room temperature for 96 h. After this, the resulting product was recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water and air-dried at 60 \u00b0C. Complete evolution of the surfactant from the as-synthesized product to yield pure perovskite structure LnFeO 3 oxides was achieved through two-stage thermal treatment: under flowing air atmosphere, the product was slowly heated to 250 \u00b0C for 2 h to make the organic matter decompose completely, and then it was calcined at 850 \u00b0C for 5 h for complete crystallization. The CTAB solutions with the different concentrations (0.02 M, 0.04 M, 0.06 M, 0.08 M, and 0.1 M) were used to prepare the LnFeO 3 and to confirm the effect of CTAB on particle sizes and sensing properties of LnFeO 3 materials. LnFeO 3 samples prepared without CTAB were synthesized with the similar process only without CTAB. 2.2 Characterization of LnFeO 3 materials Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves were obtained in flowing air on TGA 2050 with a temperature increasing rate of 10 \u00b0C/min. X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker Instruments D8) with copper target and K \u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 1.541874 \u00c5) was used for the phase identification, where the diffracted X-ray intensities were recorded as a function of 2 \u03b8 . The sample was scanned from 20\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 (2 \u03b8 ) in steps of 0.05\u00b0. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out at room temperature in ESCALAB 250 system. During XPS analysis, an Al K \u03b1 X-ray beam was adopted as the excitation source and the vacuum pressure of the instrument chamber was 1 \u00d7 10 \u22127 Pa. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photographs were obtained on XL30ESEM-TMP microscope. 2.3 Fabrication and measurement of sensors The fabrication of an indirect-heating structure sensor was described in the literature [19] . LnFeO 3 oxides were mixed with deionized water to form paste, and then coated onto the outside of an alumina tube where two Au electrodes and platinum wires had been installed at each end. The tube was 4 mm in length, 1.2 mm in external diameter, and 0.8 mm in internal diameter. The thickness of the sensitive body, which was dried and sintered in air at 500 \u00b0C for 2 h, was about 0.6 mm. A Ni\u2013Cr alloy wire crossing the alumina tube was used as a resistor to ensure both substrate heating and temperature control. In order to improve their stability and repeatability, the gas sensors were aged at operating temperature 300 \u00b0C for 150 h in air. The sensor's resistance was measured by using a conventional circuit in which the element was connected with an external resistor in series at a circuit voltage of 10 V. The gas-sensing properties were measured with static state distribution in a chamber. After acetone, gasoline or formaldehyde (HCHO) liquid was injected into the heating apparatus at the back of the chamber by a microinjector, the liquid would gasify quickly in the chamber. The electrical response of the sensors was measured with an automatic test system, controlled by a personal computer. For p-type semiconductor, the gas response \u03b2 was defined as the ratio of the electrical resistance in gas ( R gas ) to that in air ( R a ), namely \u03b2 = R gas / R a . 3 Results and discussion TGA of the as-synthesized samples shows two decreasing stages in specimen weight ( Fig. 2 ): the first is over the temperature range from room temperature to about 250 \u00b0C; the second is from 250 \u00b0C to 750 \u00b0C. The analysis results for LaFeO 3 , SmFeO 3 and EuFeO 3 as-synthesized samples are 34%, 40% and 37% total weight loss on heating to 900 \u00b0C, respectively. Presumably, the first effect is attributed to the release of residual solvent and adsorbed water. It also includes the process in which Ln(OH) 3 and Fe(OH) 3 are dehydrated to form Ln 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3 [20] . The second is associated with the desorption and decomposition of the surfactant CTAB [21] , and the forming of LnFeO 3 by Ln 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3 [22] . Little further weight loss in the TG curves is observed at temperature above 800 \u00b0C, indicating the completion of any reaction involving a weight change. From these results, we chose the two-stage thermal treatment: 250 \u00b0C for 2 h to make the organic matter decompose completely then 850 \u00b0C for 5 h for complete crystallization. The particle sizes and gas-sensing properties of LnFeO 3 prepared with the different CTAB concentrations were shown in Table 1 . It is obvious that the average particle sizes and sensing properties of LnFeO 3 materials prepared using CTAB concentration of 0.08 M is better than others concentrations. In this paper, we mainly discuss the materials prepared using 0.08 M concentration. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns revealed the formation of single-phase LnFeO 3 after calcined at 850 \u00b0C, as shown in Fig. 3 . The patterns are indexed as LaFeO 3 (JCPDS 37-1493), SmFeO 3 (JCPDS 74-1474) and EuFeO 3 (JCPDS 74-1475), and show a high degree of crystallinity. No peaks attributable to Fe 2 O 3 or Ln 2 O 3 were observed in the figures. All perovskites appeared as orthorhombic phase and the refined lattice parameters are shown in Table 2 . The X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples prepared without CTAB have same diffraction patterns and index as LaFeO 3 , SmFeO 3 , and EuFeO 3 , respectively. The surface/near surface chemical compositions of the samples were analyzed by XPS, as shown in Fig. 4 . La 3d states in the XPS spectra ( Fig. 4 (a)) are split into 3d 3/2 and 3d 5/2 , whose binding energy is 850.8 eV and 833.5 eV, respectively. The value of Sm 3d 5/2 and Eu 3d 5/2 is 1081.3 eV and 1133.5 eV, respectively ( Fig. 4 (c) and (e)), which is the specific one for those elements. The above values correspond to the binding energy of those ions (indexed Standard ESCA Spectra of the Elements and Line Energy Information, \u03a6 Co., USA). The O 1s components also show their particular binding energies in the spectra ( Fig. 4 (b), (d), and (f)). Especially, the state of O 1s indicated that there are two sorts oxygen in the surface, the lattice oxygen (O lattice ) and the adsorbed oxygen (O ads ). The adsorbed oxygen is reactable with the gas and then decreases the holes concentration [23] . Therefore, increasing the adsorbed oxygen contributes to the gas response. SEM images for the samples under investigation are shown in Fig. 5 . The LaFeO 3 samples were all spherical particle with uniform particle size distribution, while that of SmFeO 3 and EuFeO 3 were irregular. From the images we can see, the irregular order of LnFeO 3 particle prepared under the same experimental conditions is: EuFeO 3 > SmFeO 3 > LaFeO 3 . The average particle sizes of the three samples is about 300 nm. Before and after the operation at elevated temperature (247 \u00b0C, 265 \u00b0C, and 295 \u00b0C for LaFeO 3 , SmFeO 3 , and EuFeO 3 , respectively) for 15 days in air, the particles of sensing materials were not change obviously. From Fig. 5 (c), (f), and (i), one can find the particle sizes of the samples prepared without CTAB are more than those with CTAB. From Table 1 , we know that the particle sizes of the samples prepared using CTAB concentration of 0.08 M are the most minimum. Surfactant CTAB plays an important role in the preparation of LnFeO 3 oxides. The addition of CTAB not only affected the nucleation during the oxide crystallization, but also influenced the particle growth, coagulation and flocculation processes [24] . The cations (metal) were assembled within the template of surfactant micelle in an aqueous solution, and then were provided a favorable site for growth. Hence, surfactant CTAB-assisted method can be used as a finer new way to produce well-dispersed particles of LnFeO 3 oxides. As known from the literature, the electrical conductivity of sensor depends on the gas atmosphere, but also on the operating temperature of the sensing material exposed to the test gas [25] . Fig. 6 shows the operating temperature dependence of the gas response of LnFeO 3 materials to acetone, gasoline, and formaldehyde, respectively. With increasing the operating temperature, the response increased gradually and then decreased. In the low-temperature range, the energy of LnFeO 3 systems was less than the ionization energy [26] . With increasing temperature, the gas response of LnFeO 3 increased. After the optimal temperature, the gases (acetone, gasoline or formaldehyde) began to desorbe on the sensors surface and the gas response of LnFeO 3 materials decreased [27] . The highest responses can be seen for LaFeO 3 , SmFeO 3 , and EuFeO 3 when they operated at 247, 265, and 295 \u00b0C, respectively. Therefore, the temperatures of maximum response were chosen in the next works. From Fig. 5 , one can observe that LaFeO 3 , SmFeO 3 , and EuFeO 3 have good responses to acetone, gasoline, and formaldehyde, respectively. The correlation between gas concentration and LnFeO 3 gas response is shown in Fig. 7 . The adsorption of the test gas, which depends on both the concentration of the gas and the type of sensor materials, could hugely affect the gas response. As we can see obviously, the gas response was increased by the enhancement of the gas concentration in the range of 50\u20131000 ppm, 10\u201350 ppm and 50\u20131000 ppm for acetone, gasoline, and formaldehyde, respectively. The changes of gas response were more pronounced at lower concentrations, whereas at certain concentration the changes were not obvious (SmFeO 3 is not given at high concentrations). This behavior was already observed in the other literatures [28,29] and is discussed below. So the LnFeO 3 sensors fabricated can be subjected to performance for a wide range of the gases concentration at room temperature. The straight line is the calibration curve and the experimental data were fitted as: (1) R acetone R 0 = 16.66 \u2009 log \u2009 C acetone \u2212 1.01 (2) R gasoline R 0 = 1.22 \u2009 log \u2009 C gasoline + 2.64 (3) R formaldehyde R 0 = 14.76 \u2009 log \u2009 C formaldehyde \u2212 23.33 The correlation between gas concentration and LnFeO 3 gas response based on samples prepared without CTAB are also shown in Fig. 7 . According to Table 1 , we can see that the gas responses have most improvement for the sensors based on materials prepared using CTAB concentration of 0.08 M. Fig. 8 shows the dynamic response of LnFeO 3 . The operating temperatures for LaFeO 3 , SmFeO 3 , and EuFeO 3 are 247, 265, and 295 \u00b0C, respectively. As p-type semiconductors, the resistance of the sensors increased when they were exposed to the reducing gas. Then the resistance value can recover to the initial level quickly after the sensors were removed from the gas atmosphere. As important parameters for tailoring sensors for practical application, the response time and recovery time (defined as the time required to reach 80% of the final equilibrium value) of LaFeO 3 , SmFeO 3 and EuFeO 3 in 500 ppm acetone, 50 ppm gasoline and 500 ppm formaldehyde were 3 s and 58 s, 13 s and 90 s, 14 s and 18 s, respectively. From Fig. 8 , LnFeO 3 materials also presented good repetition property. On and off cycles could be repeated several times, and any major changes in the response were observed. All these advantages endow them with the potential to be practical detectors. LnFeO 3 are typical p-type semiconductors in air, and their gas-sensing mechanism is based on the changes before and after being exposed to the test gas. In the calcined process at high temperature, LnFeO 3 lost the Ln atoms at the crank pints of cells and left vacancies [26] . Their main charge-carrier holes ( h \u2022 ) are produced by the ionization of the Ln 3+ cation vacancies [27] : (4) V Ln x \u2192 V \u2034 Ln + 3 h \u2022 When the sensors based on LnFeO 3 oxides is exposed to the air by heating, the oxygen chemically adsorbed on the surface undergoes the following reactions [30] : (5) O 2 ( ad ) \u2194 O 2 ( ad ) \u2212 \u2194 2 O ( ad ) \u2212 \u2194 2 O ( ad ) 2 \u2212 When operating temperature increases, the equilibrium shifts to the right. The oxygen captures electrons from the material, leading to the increase in concentration of holes. Hence, the conductivity of the sensors increased due to the increasing concentration of available carrier. On the other hand, when the sensors were exposed to the reducing gases such as acetone, gasoline or formaldehyde in our study, the interaction between the reducing gas and the oxygen adsorbed on the sensors surface can be explained as [30] : (6) R + O ( ad ) n \u2212 \u2194 R O + n e \u2032 In many researches, it was found that acetone, gasoline or formaldehyde gas can be decomposed to CO 2 , H 2 O, and produce electrons at the same time. The possible reactions took place on the surface of LnFeO 3 oxides as follows [26,31,32] : (7) C H 3 COC H 3 + 8 O ads \u2212 \u2192 3 C O 2 + 3 H 2 O + 8 e \u2032 (8) Gasoline+O \u2192 C O 2 + CO + H 2 O (9) CO + O ads \u2212 \u2192 C O 2 + e \u2032 (10) ( HCHO ) ads + 2 ( O ads ) 2 \u2212 \u2192 C O 2 + H 2 O ( g ) + 4 e \u2032 The electrons trapped by the adsorbed oxygen are released. So, a number of electrons are annihilated with holes [26,27] : (11) h \u2022 + e \u2032 = null With the gas concentration increasing, this action enhances until saturation. Consequently, both the concentration of the holes in LnFeO 3 and conductivity of the sensors decreased. Therefore the changes in conductance determine the gas response of the sensors. The correlation between Ln elements and sensing properties is more complicated and further work is to be done to get a definite understanding. 4 Conclusion Finer perovskite-type LnFeO 3 (Ln = La, Sm, Eu) materials have been prepared via surfactant-assisted method. In the synthesis process, a cationic surfactant (CTAB) was used as organic template, and Ln\u2014chlorate, FeCl 3 and NH 4 OH were used as inorganic precursor and alkali source. The single-phased, pure perovskite structure LnFeO 3 materials can be obtained by the two-stage thermal treatment. The resulting materials have homogenous particle size distributions and porous structures. The LaFeO 3 , SmFeO 3 and EuFeO 3 sensors showed high gas response, quick response, good recovery and excellent repetition property, respectively toward acetone, gasoline and formaldehyde, indicating the potential applications using LnFeO 3 materials for the gases sensing.

        "abstract": "Antimony doped SnO 2 (ATO) microspheres composed of ATO nanoparticles were prepared by using a hydrothermal process in a nonaqueous and template-free solution from the inorganic precursors (SnCl 4 and Sb(OC 2 H 5 ) 3 ). The physical properties of the as-synthesized samples were investigated by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms, and X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS). The resulting particles were highly crystalline ATO microspheres in the diameter range of 3\u201310 \u03bcm and with many pores. The as-prepared samples were used as negative materials for lithium-ion battery, whose charge\u2013discharge properties, cyclic voltammetry, and cycle performance were examined. The results showed that a high initial discharge capacity of 1981 mAh g \u22121 and a charge capacity of 957 mAh g \u22121 in a potential range of 0.005\u20133.0 V was achieved, which suggests that tin oxide-based materials work as high capacity anodes for lithium-ion rechargeable batteries. The cycle performance is improved because the conducting ATO nanoparticles can also perform as a better matrix for lithium-ion battery anode. Keywords Nonaqueous synthesis Antimony doped SnO 2 Microspheres Li-ion battery Anode 1 Introduction For high energy density, the electrode materials in the lithium-ion batteries must possess high specific storage capacity and coulombic efficiency [1] . Tin oxide is an n-type semiconductor oxide with a wide-energy-gap ( E g = 3.62 eV, at 300 K). It has been the focus of many research activities concerning gas sensors and anode material used in Li-ion batteries because of its superior semiconducting properties [2\u201312] . SnO 2 is attractive material as a potential substitute for the conventional graphite anode because their theoretical capacity of SnO 2 (783 mAh g \u22121 ) has been estimated to be superior to that of graphite (372 mAh g \u22121 ) [13] . In the last decade, tin-based materials as electrodes for lithium-ion battery have been proposed since the announcement by Fuji Film Co. on the use of tin oxide as anode [14] . Various nanostructures of SnO 2 , such as nanoparticles [15,16] , nanotubes [17,18] , hollow spheres [2,19] , and porous structures [20,21] have been prepared and used as the anodes of lithium-ion batteries. However, the practical use of SnO 2 powders as a negative electrode in lithium-ion batteries is still hindered by several major problems: the severe volume expansion and contraction during the alloying/dealloying cycles with Li + ions and associated charge transfer process [22,23] , the pulverization and the agglomeration of primitive particles, which drastically reduces the total entrance/exit sites available for Li + ions [18] . On the other hand, the poor electronic conductivity hinders the reaction with lithium during the first discharge [24] . As an important member of transparent conductive oxides (TCOs), antimony doped tin oxide (ATO) exhibits high optical transmission, electrical conduction, stability and low cost. The synthesis and preparations of ATO are of great technological and scientific interest owing to the use of these materials as transparent electrodes, heat mirrors, displays, electrochromic windows, catalysts, rechargeable Li batteries, and energy storage devices and has potential uses in photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices [24\u201332,16,33\u201336] . This communication describes a new method to prepare ATO microspheres formed by nanoparticles. Our method is based on a hydrothermal process in a nonaqueous and template-free solution by the simple chemical reagents (SnCl 4 and Sb(OC 2 H 5 ) 3 ). 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of ATO microspheres All the chemical reagents used in the experiments were obtained from commercial sources as guaranteed-grade reagents and used without further purification. Based on our preliminary experiments, the samples with the different ratios (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 12.25, and 15.0 mol%) of Sb to Sn have been synthesized. The Sb:Sn = 12.25 mol% was found to be the most promising for the electrochemical properties. In a typical synthesis of ATO nanoparticles, 5.10 mmol of tin chloride (99.0%; Aldrich) and 0.62 mmol of antimony(III) ethoxide (Sb(OC 2 H 5 ) 3 ) were added to 12 ml of alcohol. The reaction mixture was transferred into the autoclave (Parr Acid Digestion Bombs, Teflon cups with 45 ml inner volume). The autoclave was heated at 200 \u00b0C for about 24 h. The resulting product was centrifuged, and the precipitate was thoroughly washed with ethanol and dried at room temperature. 2.2 Characterization of ATO microspheres Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photographs were obtained on XL30ESEM-TMP microscope. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were carried out with D8 diffractometer from Bruker instruments (Cu K\u03b1 radiation) in reflection mode. The sample was scanned from 20\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 (2 \u03b8 ) in steps of 0.05\u00b0. The crystallite domain sizes ( D ) have been examined from XRD peaks based on the Scherrer's equation: D = 0.9 \u03bb /(\u0394 W cos \u03b8 ), where \u03bb is the wavelength of X-ray ( \u03bb = 0.15418 nm), \u03b8 is the Bragg's diffraction angle, and \u0394 W is the true half-peak width of the X-ray diffraction lines. The transmission electron micrographs (TEM) were made with on a Zeiss EM 912 \u03a9 instrument at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV, while high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) characterization was done using a Philips CM200-FEG microscope (200 kV, C s = 1.35 mm). The samples for TEM were prepared by dispersing the final powders in ethanol; this dispersing was then dropped on carbon\u2013copper grids. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured at room temperature in ESCALAB 250. During XPS analysis, Al K\u03b1 X-ray beam was adopted as the excitation source and power was set to 250 W. Vacuum pressure of the instrument chamber was 1 \u00d7 10 \u22127 Pa as read on the panel. Measured spectra were decomposed into Gaussian components by a least-square fitting method. Bonding energy was calibrated with reference to C1s peak (285.0 eV). N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms at 77 K were recorded on a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 automated sorption analyzer. The samples were outgassed 20 h at 150 \u00b0C before the analysis. 2.3 Electrochemical characterization Electrochemical experiments were performed using Swagelok-type cells. The details were performed as previously reported [37] . Electrochemical experiments were performed using Swagelok-type cells. The working electrodes were prepared by mixing the TNHCs, carbon black, and poly(vinyl difluoride) (PVDF) at a weight ratio of 70:15:15, was pasted on pure Cu foil (99.6%, Goodfellow). Glass fiber (GF/D) from Whatman was used as a separator. The electrolyte consists of a solution of 1MLiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1, in volume) obtained fromUbeIndustries Ltd. Pure lithium foil (Aldrich) was used as counter electrode. The discharge and charge measurements were carried on an Arbin MSTAT system. The cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box. Cyclic voltammogram experiment was performed on a Voltalab 80 electrochemical workstation at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s \u22121 . 3 Results and discussion A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the resulting product is presented in Fig. 1 a . The diameter of the spheres is in the range of 3\u201310 \u03bcm. The high-resolution SEM image in Fig. 1 b suggests that ATO microspheres consist of ATO nanoparticles. One can see on the cross-section part ( Fig. 1 c) with many pores, indicating good accessibility of the pores to the exterior. The porous structure is mainly constructed by loose particle clusters and pores among the clusters. The energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX) in Fig. 1 d performed on the spheres suggests the existence of Sn, O, and Sb, apart from the Cl peak, which stems from tin chloride adsorbed onto the ATO nanoparticles. The chlorine comes from an insufficient washing of the powders. Obviously, all the elements have been detected by EDX and none is missing. EDX measurements on different spots of the samples always gave the same patterns, which prove the homogeneity of the samples. Fig. 2 shows the XRD pattern of the resulting product. The material showed well-developed diffraction lines of cassiterite (JCPDS 88-0287) without any indication of crystalline byproducts such as Sb 2 O 3 or Sb 2 O 5 . It means that the doping antimony is constructed by substituting tin atom in crystal structure. All reflections correspond to P 42/ mnm (136) space groups of SnO 2 . The refinement XRD powder pattern confirms that ATO powders contained only one phase, i.e., cassiterite SnO 2 . Wide-angle X-ray diffraction studies of ATO powders clearly show broad peaks that can be indexed according to their corresponding crystalline oxide phases. These data indicate that the inorganic products may consist of nanocrystalline oxide domains. The analysis of X-ray diffraction line broadenings clearly reveals the nearly cassiterite (SnO 2 ) character of these crystallites whose size is about 14.8 nm estimated by using Scherrer's equation ((1 1 0) reflection). It confirms again that the micrometer-sized spheres are composed of nanocrystalline ATO particles. Further investigation on ATO microspheres is performed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The image of ATO microspheres is shown in Fig. 3 a . They ranged in diameter size from 3 \u03bcm to 10 \u03bcm. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of ATO microspheres ( Fig. 3 b) shows the characteristic diffraction rings, which correspond to the reflections (1 1 0), (1 0 1), (2 0 0), (2 1 1), and (3 0 1) of Cassiterite structure. The Debye\u2013Scherrer rings clearly indicate the polycrystalline nature of the powder. In order to gain further insights into the chemical composition and into the atomic ratio of Sn, Sb and O in the ATO microspheres, the sample was analyzed by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and shown in Fig. 4 . The measurement also provides information about the final composition of the ATO microspheres, i.e., the final concentration of the Sb doping in SnO2. XPS spectrum ( Fig. 4 a) confirmed the high chemical purity of the ATO microspheres consisting solely of Sn, Sb and O. Spectrum of individual line of Sn3d measured at high resolution shows ( Fig. 4 b) narrow range scans for the sample. The XPS spectrum shows two peaks of 3d5 and 3d3 at 486.7 eV and 495.1 eV with a better symmetry, and they are assigned to the lattice tin in tin oxide. They have a peak separation of 8.4 eV between these two peaks. The values correspond to a binding energy of Sn(IV) ion (indexed Standard ESCA Spectra of the Elements and Line Energy Information, \u03a6 Co., USA). The Sb3d 5/2 and Sb3d 3/2 spin\u2013orbital spectra were assigned to binding energies 530.8 eV and 540.1 eV ( Fig. 4 c). Calculations of the areas of the Sn3d 5/2 and Sb3d 5/2 emission lines using sensitivity factors (4.89 for Sn3d 5/2 and 4.80 for Sb3d 5/2 ) resulted in the atomic Sb-to-Sn ratio of 10.23, which is generally slightly smaller as compared to the starting recipes. The result is in good with XANES measurements [38] , which showed that the largest fraction of Sb has a valency of 5 + . N 2 -sorption isotherm was recorded and is shown in Fig. 5 a . A type V adsorption\u2013desorption isotherm was found, which points to the existence of an interparticle mesoporous structure. The ATO microspheres have a Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) surface area of 64.6 m 2 g \u22121 , which totally arises from mesopores, according to our measurement. Fig. 5 b shows the pore size distributions for ATO microspheres as determined using the BJH model analysis and the desorption branch isotherm. BJH pore size distribution indicates that a number of large mesopores in various sizes of 19.1 and 25.5 nm exist in the ATO microspheres. The porous structures are generally more suitable for accommodating volume variations of the Sn phase during cycling [39] . To evaluate the potential applicability in high-power Li batteries, we investigated some preliminary electrochemical characterizations of the as-synthesized ATO microspheres with respect to Li insertion/extraction. The cycle voltammogram (CV) in the potential range of 5 mV to 3.0 V vs. Li/Li + was usually used to analyze the active voltage range for the ATO electrodes. The CV curve ( Fig. 6 a ) for the ATO electrodes clearly indicates a reaction during the first discharge with a reduction peak at 0.71 V. The profile is substantially similar to those observed for SnO 2 [40] and antimony doped SnO 2 [24] . The strong reduction peak at 0.70 V can be corresponded to the formation of both the Sn, Sb metals and the Sn\u2013Sb alloy in the Li 2 O matrix (Eq. (1) and (2) ), which only happens in the first discharge cycle [24] : (1) Sb x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 + Li \u21d2 (1 \u2212 x )Sn + x Sb + Li 2 O (2) Sb x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 + L i \u21d2 Sb x Sn 1\u2212 x + Li 2 O The oxidation peak at 0.71 V corresponds to the formation of Li x Sb and Li y Sn alloys (0 \u2264 x \u2264 3, 0 \u2264 y \u2264 4.4). Theoretically, a complete discharge process means the reduction reactions: (3) Sb + x Li \u21d2 Li x Sb (4) Sn + y Li \u21d2 Li y Sn (5) Sb x Sn y + xy Li \u21d2 Li y Sn + Li x Sb The first cycle charge\u2013discharge curve at a constant current of ca. C/5 with a cutoff voltage window of 5 mV to 3 V is shown in Fig. 6 b. A discharge capacity of 1981 mA h g \u22121 and a charge capacity of 957 mA h g \u22121 in the first cycle are achieved, which suggests that ATO material works as high capacity anode for lithium-ion rechargeable battery. The ATO anode shows the initial discharge and charge capacities are much larger than the tin oxide anodes reported previously [41\u201343] . However, it also suffers from a large amount of irreversible capacity in the first discharge\u2013charge cycle. The capacity loss for the first cycle is 1024 mA h g \u22121 , that is initial irreversible capacity is 51.7%. The large irreversible capacity loss was caused by the reduction of ATO by the following irreversible reaction (Eq. (1) and (2) ) in the first cycle. The chlorine residue has also an influence to irreversibility capacity loss. Further work is to be done to get a definite understanding. The porous structured ATO microspheres may trap more Li + during electrochemical cycling, resulting in large irreversible capacities [24,39] . A columbic efficiency of 48.3% could be calculated. For the ATO microspheres, the reversible capacity (Charge) is higher than SnO 2 for the first cycle. The amount of formation of metallic tin and antimony from ATO is an important factor for the reversible capacity. The high reversible capacity for ATO microspheres may be due to the presence of about 12 mol% Sb for Sn, leading to an increase in the amount of formation of metals from ATO. The reversible capacity mainly depends on the alloying of Li with metals, and hence, the increase in the amount of Sn and Sb will obviously show some increase in the capacity. The initial discharge capacity of ATO microspheres is at 941 mA h g \u22121 ( Fig. 6 c). This value can be retained as big as 227 and 194 mA h g \u22121 after 50 and 100 cycles, respectively. It shown by the ATO microspheres electrode is higher than that of commercial nanocrystalline SnO 2 (less than 100 mA h g \u22121 after 100 cycles) [40] , and of nanostructured antimony doped SnO 2 thin films (10% Sb, less than 60 mA h g \u22121 after 75 cycles) [24] . Highly porous materials are believed to be able to increase the diffusion of lithium ions by reducing the length of the diffusion path [44] so that the capacity and reversibility of the electrode are improved [45,46] . Then, the high surface area of ATO microspheres provided by the porous nanostructure is supposed to be responsible for the relatively high capacity and good reversibility in our work. The high initial discharge capacity of about 1981 mAh/g seems to exceed the theoretical capacity (783 m Ah g \u22121 ) of SnO 2 , which may result from two reasons: the first is that the conductive ATO has a capacity contribution to the total discharge capacity of ATO anode electrode comparing with the same charge\u2013discharge condition as SnO 2 electrode. Secondly, the ATO anode does exhibit almost its theoretical capacity due to the nanostructure characteristics. 4 Conclusion To elucidate the structural and electrochemical properties, Sb doped SnO 2 (ATO) microspheres composed of ATO nanoparticles were synthesized by a hydrothermal process in a nonaqueous and template-free solution and were analyzed by XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, and electrochemical measurements. The TEM, XRD, and XPS results showed that the ATO microspheres with many pores were synthesized and had tetragonal rutile structures (cassiterite SnO 2 ). The electrochemical behavior of ATO microspheres has been studied. High initial discharge capacity about 1981 mAh g \u22121 was observed at a constant discharge current density of ca. C/5 in a potential range of 0.005\u20133.0 V. The porous nanostructure reduces the possibility of tin aggregation and accommodates the volume change of the tin phase during Li alloying/de-alloying. In the case of electrochemical measurements, it was found that a capacity of 194 mA h g \u22121 after 100 cycles has been demonstrated by the ATO anode material synthesized through the present study. It is expected that antimony doped SnO 2 nanostructures are an important indication for the further improvement of lithium-ion battery anode of SnO 2 systems.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Molybdenum sulfide nanosheets on nitrogen-doped carbon nanowires (MoS 2 /C N  NWs) were utilized to construct an electrochemical biosensor for hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). Polypyrrole nanowires (PPy NWs) were synthesized using a surfactant-assisted method, and few layers of MoS 2  nanosheet grew on PPy NWs by a hydrothermal approach. After a sintering process, the prepared MoS 2 /C N  nanohybrid was supposed to enhance the electrochemical catalytic performance for H 2 O 2  resulting from the synergistic effect between the high stability of C N  NWs and abundant active sites of MoS 2  nanosheets. The C N  NWs served as the framework for the few-layered MoS 2  to form a core-shell structure which could increase the stability and electrochemical conductivity of MoS 2  nanocomposite. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to characterize the crystallinity of MoS 2  and the nitrogen-doped carbon nanowires. The electrochemical responses showed that the MoS 2 /C N  NWs modified electrode has a good catalytic performance toward H 2 O 2  determination with a wide linear range from 2 to 500\u2009\u03bcM, and a low detection limit of 0.73\u2009\u03bcM (S/N\u2009=\u20093). Moreover, the fabricated electrochemical biosensor performed monitoring of H 2 O 2  released from A549 living cells, indicating that the MoS 2 /C N  NWs offered a simple and convenient pathway in the fields of electrochemical sensing.",

Characterization by TEM, SEM and BET techniques demonstrates that the Al-doping ZnO powders have a coral-like morphology with a hierarchically porous structure from macro pores, with the wall containing smaller mesopores. The gas-sensing characteristics of the ZnO samples with different Al-doping concentrations are investigated and the results indicate that the gas sensor prepared from 2.5 at% Al doping ZnO powders shows the highest gas sensitivity and selectivity towards  n -butanol. A maximum gas response of 751.95 towards 100\u00a0ppm  n -butanol is achieved at the operating temperature of 300\u00a0\u00b0C. The mechanisms of responses are also proposed considering the unique material structure.",

The advantage of this structure greatly relies on the crucial design of both core and shell, thus achieving an inter-component synergistic effect. In this report, we show that decorating semiconductor nanocrystals with a boronate polymer shell can easily achieve programmable core-shell interactions. Taking ZnO and anatase TiO2 nanocrystals as inner core examples, the effective core-shell interactions can narrow the band gap of semiconductor nanocrystals, change the HOMO and LUMO levels of boronate polymer shell and significantly improve the carrier density of core-shell particles. The hole mobility of core-shell particles can be improved by almost 9 orders of magnitude in comparison with net boronate polymer, while the conductivity of core-shell particles is at most 30-folds of nanocrystals. The particle engineering strategy is based on two driving forces: catechol-surface binding and B-N dative bonding, and has a high ability to control and predict the shell thickness. Also, this approach is applicable to various inorganic nanoparticles with different components, sizes and shapes.",

The modified cotton fabric shows characteristic of superhydrophobic property with water contact angle of 154.8\u00b0, and exhibits promising self-cleaning performance. With the characters of hydrophobicity and lipophilicity, the modified cotton fabric can efficiently separate oil-water mixture and even emulsion.

Compared to pure EP, the char yields of the EP composites were increased. The LOI value and UL-94 ratings of the EP composite with a loading of 5% POSS-bisDOPO reached 31.0% and V-0 grade, respectively. The PHRR and THR reduced to 28.4 W g\u22121 and 1.7 kJ g\u22121. SEM results indicated that the char of the EP composites had an alveolate inner layer and continual compact outer layer, which was conducive to form effectively physical barrier to hinder the penetrating of oxygen and heat.

        "abstract": "The development of a multi-element synergistic flame-retardant depends largely on the design and synthesis of flame-retardants comprising a mixture of elements such as P, N and Si. Herein, we prepare a novel POSS derivative named octa-(N,N-(bis-(9,10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthene-10-yl)methyl)aminopropyl) silsesquioxane (ODMAS) that features a high content of P. The chemical structure of ODMAS was confirmed by FT-IR, 1H NMR, 29Si NMR, 31P NMR and elemental analysis. Because of the excellent compatibility between ODMAS and epoxy resin, the as-prepared ODMAS/EP composites are highly transparent as well as possessing improved flame-retardancy and mechanical properties. The results show that the LOI value reaches 37.1% with a low phosphorus content (1.6 wt%), samples only 5 wt% loading are classified with the V0 rating in the UL-94 test, and the char yield significantly increased and the maximum weight loss rate decreased with increased ODMAS loading. Results of a three-point bending test show that the flexural modulus of ODMAS/EP is higher than that of the pure epoxy resin. All results indicate that this novel flame retardant not only has good solubility in the polymer matrix, but can also simultaneously improve the flame resistance and mechanical properties of the polymeric material.",

The molecular structures of 4,4\u2032-((1,4-phenylenebis(methanylylidene))bis(azanylylidene))bis(N-phenylaniline) (DPN intermediate) and DPN are characterized by FTIR, NMR, and MS. TGA tests show that the char yield of DPN/EP composites raises to 30.9% when the molar ratio of DPN to 4,4-diaminodiphenyl methane(DDM) is 20:80. Tg values of DPN/EP composites tested by DSC and DMA are similar to neat epoxy resin (EP), which is due to the secondary amine in DPN that participates in the cross-linking reaction of epoxy resin. The storage modulus in the rubber stage (E\u2032-190 \u00b0C) of flame-retardant epoxy resin is close to that of neat EP, while their tan\u03b4u0027s are lower, which indicates the similarity of samplesu0027 cross-linking density due to the participation of DPN in the cross-linking reaction. The results show that when the molar ratio of DPN and DDM is 5:95, the epoxy has a higher Tg value and better mechanical properties than other samples. The introduction of DPN efficiently improves the flame-retardant properties of epoxy resin with V-0 rating of UL-94 vertical burning test, non-dripping, 41% of limit oxygen index (LOI) value, low peak heat release rate (PHRR), and total heat release (THR).",

The advantage of this structure greatly relies on the crucial design of both core and shell, thus achieving an inter-component synergistic effect. In this report, we show that decorating semiconductor nanocrystals with a boronate polymer shell can easily achieve programmable core-shell interactions. Taking ZnO and anatase TiO2 nanocrystals as inner core examples, the effective core-shell interactions can narrow the band gap of semiconductor nanocrystals, change the HOMO and LUMO levels of boronate polymer shell and significantly improve the carrier density of core-shell particles. The hole mobility of core-shell particles can be improved by almost 9 orders of magnitude in comparison with net boronate polymer, while the conductivity of core-shell particles is at most 30-folds of nanocrystals. The particle engineering strategy is based on two driving forces: catechol-surface binding and B-N dative bonding, and has a high ability to control and predict the shell thickness. Also, this approach is applicable to various inorganic nanoparticles with different components, sizes and shapes.",

The as-designed POSS-bisDOPO was characterized by FT-IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 31P NMR, 2D NMR, and MS. POSS-bisDOPO was introduced into epoxy resins to obtain flame-retardant materials. The LOI value can reach 34.5% when the content of POSS-bisDOPO is 20 wt%. The TGA results showed that the char yield was significantly improved in cured POSS-bisDOPO/EP. The ATR-FTIR results, optical images and SEM analyses indicated that the residual char had a compact and coherent appearance in the inner layer, while the outer structure was intumescent and multi-porous. Therefore, by isolating heat and oxygen more efficiently, the char played an important role in improving the thermal stability and flame retardancy of cured POSS-bisDOPO/EP. The three-point bending test results showed that the mechanical strength of POSS-bisDOPO/EP was higher than those of pure EP and POSS\u2013NH2/EP due to the outstanding reinforcement effect of the unique nanostructure of POSS-bisDOPO assembled in the EP matrix. These data indicated that POSS-bisDOPO not only obviously enhances the flame retardancy, but also improves the mechanical properties of epoxy resins.",

PDT) was synthesized by nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction and was combined with curing-agent to prepare epoxy resin composites, incorporating both nanocaged framework of Si O and rigid phenyl-rings from triazine and DOPO into the epoxy matrix at molecular level. The prepared EP-PDT composites were characterized by means of techniques such as TGA-IR, Raman, SEM, EDX analysis, Py-GC/MS and XPS etc. It showed that all samples had a single T g , indicating that these epoxy composites were homogeneous phase for long-term use. Both the LOI value and char yield increased with the increasing of PDT content, while the corresponding PHRR and THR data of EP composites dropped. SEM revealed that PDT in EP composites self-assembled into nano-sized particles, resulting in an enhanced mechanical property. Py-GC/MS and XPS characterizations showed that PDT could release free radicals and promote the char formation deriving from the synergic effect of phosphorus, nitrogen and silicon during combustion, which resulted in the formation of quenching and barrier effects to endow the EP composites with excellent thermal stability and flame retardancy for potential applications in many fields.",

        "abstract": "In order to develop new phosphorus\u2013nitrogen-containing flame retardants, three novel compounds of DOPO-substituted aminophenyl-s-triazine (TAT-DOPO) with different P/N element ratios were synthesized by Kabachnik\u2013Fields reaction. TAT-triDOPO possessing three DOPO units in one molecule exhibited the best thermal stability. Besides, TAT-triDOPO and TAT-hexaDOPO possessing active hydrogen displayed the characteristics of reactive-type retardant, while TAT-enneaDOPO without active hydrogen represented additive-type retardant. The influences of three TAT-DOPO compounds on the thermal stability, flame retardancy and mechanical properties of the cured EP composites were investigated. Compared with pure EP, the char yields of EP/TAT-DOPO were increased. The LOI value and the UL-94 ratings of EP/TAT-triDOPO with a 5% loading were improved to 34.0% and V-0 grade. The PHRR, THR and HRC of EP/TAT-triDOPO were decreased by 25.7%, 21.1% and 25.4%, respectively. Furthermore, the incorporation of TAT-triDOPO could also improve the flexural strength and elastic modulus of cured EP. It was explained that the existence of active hydrogen atoms within TAT-triDOPO molecule can act as effective chemical cross-linking points in EP network. Finally, based on the SEM and TGA-FTIR analysis of pyrolytic products of cured EP/TAT-DOPO, it was deduced that the prepared TAT-DOPO flame retardant could exhibit both condensed phase and gas phase flame-retardancy mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Trehalases are a group of enzymes that catalyse the conversion of trehalose to glucose, and they are observed in most organisms. In this study, the first echinoderm trehalase, designated Hl-Tre, was identified from a tropical sea cucumber, Holothuria leucospilota. The full-length cDNA of H. leucospilota trehalase (Hl-Tre) is 2461\u202fbp in length with an open reading frame (ORF) of 1788\u202fbp that encodes a 595-amino-acid protein with a deduced molecular weight of 67.95 KDa. The Hl-Tre protein contains a signal peptide at the N-terminal and a functional trehalase domain, which includes the signature motifs 1 and 2. The mRNA expression of Hl-Tre was ubiquitously detected in all selected tissues, with the highest level being detected in the intestine. By in situ hybridization (ISH), the positive Hl-Tre signals were observed in the brush borders of the intestinal mucosa. In embryonic and larval stages, the transcript levels of Hl-Tre decreased during embryonic development and increased after the pentactula stage. After a challenge of starvation, the intestinal Hl-Tre mRNA levels were observed to be first decreased and partially recovered thereafter. Overall, our study provided the first evidence for trehalase in echinoderms and showed that this enzyme was potentially linked to a trehalose metabolic pathway in sea cucumbers.",

In addition, HLcaspase-6 contains a short pro-domain. HLcaspase-6 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined, with the highest transcript level in the intestine, followed by coelomocytes. In in vitro experiments, the expression of HLcaspase-6 mRNA in coelomocytes was significantly up-regulated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid [poly (I:C)] challenge, suggesting that HLcaspase-6 might play important roles in the innate immune defense of sea cucumber against bacterial and viral infections.

        "abstract": "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a multifunctional protein that widely exists in eukaryotic species. In this study, two PCSK9 paralogs, named StmPCSK9-1 and StmPCSK9-2, were identified from the tropical sea cucumber (Stichopus monotuberculatus). The cDNAs of StmPCSK9-1 and StmPCSK9-2 are 1330\u00a0kb and 1508\u00a0kb in size, respectively. The open reading frames (ORF) for StmPCSK9-1 and StmPCSK9-2 cDNAs are 1128 and 1167\u00a0bp in length, encoding the proteins of 375 and 388 amino acids with the deduced molecular weights of 38.76 and 41.07\u00a0kDa, respectively. In accord with other members in PCSK9 family, the two StmPCSK9 paralogs possessed the inhibitor_I9 and peptidase_S8 functional domains, seven active sites, a catalytic triad and two calcium binding sites. For the gene structure, the splicing of the two StmPCSK9 paralogs was relatively conserved. In addition, the mRNA expression of StmPCSK9-1 and StmPCSK9-2 was only detected in the sea cucumber intestine and coelomocytes, and the expression levels of both the two StmPCSK9 paralogs were higher in intestine. Moreover, StmPCSK9-2 was found to be a cytoplasm protein without signal peptide, and show no response to the immune challenge. On the contrary, StmPCSK9-1 was a secreted protein and the transcriptional expression of StmPCSK9-1 was significantly up-regulated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) treatment and slightly down-regulated by polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid [Poly (I:C)] challenge in in\u00a0vitro experiments performed in the cultural primary coelomocytes, suggesting that the StmPCSK9-1 may play critical roles in the innate immune defense of sea cucumber, S.\u00a0monotuberculatus, against bacterial and/or viral infections.

        "abstract": "A novel antistasin/WAP-like serine protease inhibitor, named as StmAW-SPI, was identified from sea cucumber (Stichopus monotuberculatus) and functionally characterized in this study. The full-length cDNA of StmAW-SPI is 1917 bp in length with a 72 bp 5'-untranslated region (UTR), a 294 bp 3'-UTR and a 1551 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein of 516 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 54.56\u00a0kDa. The StmAW-SPI protein has 5-fold internal repeats (IRs) of antistasin domain and 6-fold IRs of WAP domain. For the gene structure, StmAW-SPI contains 10 exons separated by 9 introns. The StmAW-SPI mRNA expression pattern was determined using quantitative real-time PCR. The highest level of StmAW-SPI was found in the intestine, followed by coelomocytes, gonad, body wall and respiratory tree. The StmAW-SPI expressions were significantly up-regulated after polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid [Poly (I:C)] or lipopolysaccharides (LPS) challenge in in\u00a0vitro experiments performed in primary coelomocytes. In addition, the serine protease inhibitory activity and bacterial protease inhibitory activity of StmAW-SPI were examined, and the antibacterial activity was also demonstrated in this study. Our study, as a whole, suggested that StmAW-SPI might play a critical role in the innate immune defense of sea cucumber against microbial infections, by not only inactivating the serine protease but also inhibiting the growth of pathogens.",

To develop the artificial breeding methods of  H. leucospilota , we conducted the first detailed study on the processes of spawning, embryonic and larval development, and juvenile growth of the species. The results showed that the suitable breeding season of  H. leucospilota  in the Daya Bay might be from June to October and that at least 30\u202fdays were needed for embryos to develop into juveniles at a temperature of 29\u221233\u202f\u00b0C, a salinity of 27\u221230\u2030, and a pH of 7.9\u22128.2. The survival rate of the juveniles were approximately 8.5%, the average growth rate during days 31\u221249 of culture was 0.11\u202fmm per day and increased to 0.72\u202fmm per day during days 73\u2212120. The body color of the juveniles was transparent yellow at approximately 55\u202fdays of culture, and it began to darken at 79\u202fdays later. These results indicated that an artificial culture method of  H. leucospilota  was realized. Our research might contribute a feasible way to the artificial breeding, natural resource restoration, and sustainable use of tropical sea cucumbers.",

        "abstract": "In this study, an echinoderm tumor necrosis factor receptor named HLTNFR-16 was first cloned from the tropical sea cucumber Holothuria leucospilota. The full-length cDNA of HLTNFR-16 is 3675 bp in size, containing a 415 bp 5'-untranslated region (UTR), a 2024 bp 3'-UTR and a 1236 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein of 411 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 45.63\u202fkDa. The HLTNFR-16 protein contains a signal peptide, four TNFR domains (the last three were identified as extracellular cysteine-rich domains), a transmembrane region and a death domain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that HLTNFR-16 was clustered into a clade with TNFR-16s in other species, indicating that this echinoderm TNFR may be a new member of the TNFR-16 subfamily. The results of TUNEL assay showed that the over expression of HLTNFR-16 could induce apoptosis in HEK293T cells. When HLTNFR-16 was silenced by siRNA, the apoptosis of sea cucumber coelomocytes induced by inactivated Vibrio harveyi was suppressed significantly, indicating that HLTNFR-16 is important for apoptosis induction. Additionally, luciferase reporter assay exhibited that the over-expressed HLTNFR-16 in HEK293T cells could activate the transcription factors nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1). Moreover, the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-18 in HEK293T cells was increased by the over-expression of HLTNFR-16. This study provides evidences for the potential roles of sea cucumber TNFR in the innate immunity.",

        "abstract": "The non-specific protease inhibitor alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) is a key macromolecular glycoprotein that involved in host immune defense against pathogens in vertebrates and invertebrates. However, no research regarding A2M has been developed in echinoderms to date. In this study, the full-length cDNA of A2M was cloned from the sea cucumber (Holothuria atra), which is a tropical species widely distributed along the coasts of the South China Sea and designated HaA2M. HaA2M possesses all three conserved functional domains of known A2M proteins, including the bait region domain, thioester domain and receptor-binding domain. Compared to fish and shrimp A2Ms, the histidine residue from the catalytical regions is well conserved in HaA2M. HaA2M mRNA was predominantly expressed in coelomocytes and, to a lesser extent, in the body wall, intestine and respiratory tree. A2M activity was detected in the coelomic fluids of H. atra. The mRNA expression and activity levels were investigated in the major immune tissues and coelomic fluids of H. atra after challenge with inactivated Vibrio alginolyticus or polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid [Poly (I: C)]. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of HaA2M resulted in a significant reduction of HaA2M gene transcript level (86%). RNAi-mediated silencing of HaA2M gene significantly decreased the A2M activity (38%) and increased the number of viable bacteria (2.8-fold) in the coelomic fluids of H. atra infected by V. alginolyticus. Our study, as a whole, supplied the evidences for HaA2M as an immune-relevant molecule and it might have multiple functions in the innate immune system of H. atra.",

        "abstract": "The broad-spectrum protease inhibitor alpha-2-macroglobulin (M-2) is widely found in vertebrates and invertebrates. However, no research regarding M-2 has been described in sea cucumbers to date. In this study, the first sea cucumber M-2 named Stm(2)M was identified from Stichopus monotuberculatus, a tropical species with high edible and economic values in Southern China. The Stm(2)M cDNA is 5276bp in length, containing a 5-untranslated region (UTR) of 279bp, a 3-UTR of 344bp and an open reading frame of 4653bp that encodes a protein of 1550 amino acids. The Stm(2)M possesses all the three characteristics of known M-2 proteins, including the bait region domain, thioester domain and receptor-binding domain. Higher levels of mRNA expression were noticed in intestine, respiratory tree, coelomocytes and tentacle of S.monotuberculatus. Transcriptional expression of Stm(2)M showed the strongest response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS, 8.19-fold up-regulation) after 6h post-challenge in coelomocytes. In addition, the M-2 activity was detected in S.monotuberculatus and protein activity of M-2 increased remarkably at 6h after LPS stimulation. As a whole, this study indicated that Stm(2)M is an important immune-related molecule, and the study on functions of Stm(2)M may provide some new and valuable ideas for preventing and controlling diseases of cultured sea cucumbers.",

Until now, the researches of shrimp lectins are mainly focused on C-type lectins. In this study, we identified a new L-type lectin, designated as LvLTLC1, from the shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. The cDNA of LvLTLC1 is 1184 bp with an open reading frame of 990 bp encoding a protein of 329 amino acids. The LvLTLC1 protein contained a putative signal peptide, an L-type lectin-like domain, and a transmembrane helix region. Phylogenetic analysis showed that LvLTLC1 belonged to VIP36-like family. LvLTLC1 was expressed in all examined tissues but had higher expression level in gills and hepatopancreas than other tissues. LvLTLC1 expression was up-regulated after immune challenge by Vibrio harveyi and lipopolysaccharide. The recombinant LvLTLC1 agglutinated Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (V. harveyi, V. parahaemolyticus, V. alginolyticus, V. cholerae, V. vulnificus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens) in a calcium-independent manner. Recombinant LvLTLC1 exerted the ability of enhancing the clearance of V. harveyi injected in shrimp. Our results indicated that LvLTLC1 functions in anti-pathogen innate immunity of shrimp.",

        "abstract": "Vitellogenesis is the process of yolk formation via accumulating vitellin (Vn) with nutrients in the oocytes. Expression of vitellogenin (Vg), the precursor of Vn, is one of the indicators for the start of vitellogenesis. In Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei), the type-II vitellogenesis-inhibiting hormone (VIH-2) effectively suppresses hepatopancreatic Vg mRNA expression. In this study, we demonstrate the increasing transcript levels of hepatopancreatic Vg during L. vannamei ovarian development, suggesting that the hepatopancreas-derived Vg/Vn may also contribute to vitellogenesis in this species. Using a combination of in vivo injections and in vitro primary cell cultures, we provide evidences that the inhibition of VIH-2 on hepatopancreatic Vg gene expression is mediated through a functional coupling of the GC/cGMP pathway with different MAPK-dependent cascades in female shrimp. In VIH-2 signaling, the NO-independent GC/cGMP/PKG cascades were upstream of the MAPKs. Activations of the MAPK signal by VIH-2 include the phosphorylation of JNK and the mRNA/protein expression of P38MAPK. Additionally, the cAMP/PKA pathway is another positive intracellular signal for hepatopancreatic Vg mRNA expression but is independent of its VIH-2 regulation. Our findings establish a model for the signal transduction mechanism of Vg regulation by VIH and shed light on the biological functions and signaling of the CHH family in crustaceans.",

However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of this species involved in the response to cold stress. In this study, four separate RNA-Seq libraries of L. vannamei were generated from 13\u00b0C stress and control temperature. Total 29,662 of Unigenes and overall of 19,619 annotated genes were obtained. Three comparisons were carried out among the four libraries, in which 72 of the top 20% of differentially-expressed genes were obtained, 15 GO and 5 KEGG temperature-sensitive pathways were fished out. Catalytic activity (GO: 0003824) and Metabolic pathways (ko01100) were the most annotated GO and KEGG pathways in response to cold stress, respectively. In addition, Calcium, MAPK cascade, Transcription factor and Serine/threonine-protein kinase signal pathway were picked out and clustered. Serine/threonine-protein kinase signal pathway might play more important roles in cold adaptation, while other three signal pathway were not widely transcribed. Our results had summarized the differentially-expressed genes and suggested the major important signaling pathways and related genes. These findings provide the first profile insight into the molecular basis of L. vannamei response to cold stress.",

        "abstract": "Soil salinization erodes the farmlands and poses a serious threat to human life, reuse of the saline-alkali lands as cultivated resources becomes increasingly prominent. Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) is an important farmed aquatic species for the development and utilization of the saline-alkali areas. However, little is known about the adaptation mechanism of this species in terms of high-pH stress. In the present study, a transcriptome analysis on the gill tissues of L. vannamei in response to high-pH stress (pH 9.3 \u00b1 0.1) was conducted. After analyzing, the cyclic nucleotide gated channel-Ca2+ (CNGC-Ca2+) and patched 1 (Ptc1) were detected as the majority annotated components in the cAMP signaling pathway (KO04024), indicating that the CNGC-Ca2+ and Ptc1 might be the candidate components for transducing and maintaining the high-pH stress signals, respectively. The immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), heat shock protein (HSP), glutathione s-transferase (GST), prophenoloxidase/phenoloxidase (proPO/PO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (ALF) and lipoprotein were discovered as the major transcribed immune factors in response to high-pH stress. To further detect hub regulation-genes, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed; the genes/proteins \"Polymerase (RNA) II (DNA directed) polypeptide A\" (POLR2A), \"Histone acetyltransferase p300\" (EP300) and \"Heat shock 70kDa protein 8\" (HSPA8) were suggested as the top three hub regulation-genes in response to acute high-pH stress; the genes/proteins \"Heat shock 70kDa protein 4\" (HSPA4), \"FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog\" (FOS) and \"Nucleoporin 54kDa\" (NUP54) were proposed as the top three hub regulation-genes involved in adapting endurance high-pH stress; the protein-interactions of \"EP300-HSPA8\" and \"HSPA4-NUP54\" were detected as the most important biological interactions in response to the high-pH stress; and the HSP70 family genes might play essential roles in the adaptation of the high-pH stress environment in L. vannamei. These findings provide the first insight into the molecular and immune basis of L. vannamei in terms of high-pH environments, and the construction of a PPI network might improve our understanding in revealing the hub regulation-genes in response to abiotic stress in shrimp species and might be beneficial for further studies.",

        "abstract": "Heat shock proteins (HSPs), a family of conserved proteins that are produced by cells in response to stresses, are known as molecular chaperones with a range of housekeeping and cellular protective functions. The 40 kD heat shock protein (HSP40) is a co-chaperone for HSP70 in the regulation of ATP hydrolysis. Unlike its well-documented cofactor HSP70, little is currently known regarding the biological functions of HSP40 in crustacean species such as penaeid shrimp. In the present study, the cDNA encoding HSP40 (-HSP40) was identified from the Pacific white shrimp , a highly significant commercial culture species. The structural organization indicates that Lv-HSP40 belongs to the type-I HSP40s. The muscle, gill, and hepatopancreas are the main sites of  transcript expression. Within these tissues,  mRNA were predominantly exhibited in the myocytes, epithelial cells and hepatopancreatic cells, respectively. Under acute thermal stress in the culture environment,  transcript levels are significantly induced in these three tissues, while low pH stress only upregulates  mRNA in the hepatopancreas and gill. During ontogenesis,  transcript levels are high at early embryonic stages and drop sharply at late embryonic and early larval stages. The ovary is another major organ of  mRNA expression in female shrimp, and  transcripts were mainly presented in the follicle cells but only weekly detected in the oocytes. Ovarian  mRNA levels increase continuously during gonadal development. Silencing of the  gene by RNA interference may effectively delay ovarian maturation after unilateral eyestalk ablation. The roles of Lv-HSP40 in ovarian development are speculated to be independent of its cofactor HSP70, and the vitellogenesis factor vitellogenin () and vitellogenin receptor (). Our study, as a whole, provides new insights into the roles of HSP40 in multiple physiological processes in : (1) HSP40 is a responding factor during stressful conditions; and (2) HSP40 participates in embryonic and ovarian development.",

        "abstract": "Na+/H+ exchangers are the most common membrane proteins involved in the regulation of intracellular pH that concurrently transport Na+ into the cells and H+ out of the cells. In this study, the full-length cDNA of the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) from the Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) was cloned. The LvNHE cDNA is 3167 bp long, contains a 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of 74 bp and a 3'-UTR of 456 bp and an open reading frame (ORF) of 2637 bp, coding for a protein of 878 amino acids with 11 putative transmembrane domains and a long cytoplasmic tail. LvNHE shows high sequence homology with mud crab NHE at the amino acid level. LvNHE mRNA was detected in the hepatopancreas, gill, eyestalk, skin, heart, intestine, muscle, brain and stomach, with the highest abundance in the intestine. In the shrimp intestinal fragment cultures exposed to gradually declining pH medium (from pH 8.0 to pH 6.4), the LvNHE mRNA expression was significantly stimulated, with the highest response when incubated in pH 7.0 medium for 6 h. To investigate the functional roles of LvNHE in pH regulation at the physiological and cellular levels, the LvNHE mRNA expression was silenced by siRNA knockdown. Upon low-pH challenge, the hemolymph pH was significantly reduced in the LvNHE mRNA knockdown shrimp. In addition, knockdown of LvNHE mRNA reduced the recovery capacity of intracellular pH in intestinal fragment cultures after acidification. Altogether, this study demonstrates the role of NHE in shrimp response to low pH stress and provides new insights into the acid/base homeostasis mechanisms of crustaceans.",

        "abstract": "The sodium bicarbonate cotransporter (NBC) is an integral membrane ion transporter that can transport HCO (or a related species, such as CO) across the plasma membrane. Previous researches revealed that NBC might play an important role in the regulation of intracellular pH in vertebrates. In the present study, an NBC cDNA was identified from Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) and designated as Lv-NBC. The full-length Lv-NBC cDNA is 4479 bp in size, containing a 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of 59 bp, a 3'-UTR of 835 bp and an open reading frame (ORF) of 3585 bp that encodes a protein of 1194 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 134.34\u00a0kDa. The Lv-NBC protein contains two functional domains (Band_3_cyto and HCO3_cotransp) and twelve transmembrane (TM) domains. Expression of the Lv-NBC mRNA was ubiquitously detected in all selected tissues, with the highest level in the gill. By in situ hybridization (ISH) with Digoxigenin-labeled probe, the Lv-NBC positive cells were shown mainly located in the secondary gill filaments. After low or high pH challenge, the transcript levels of Lv-NBC in the gill were found to be up-regulated. After knockdown of the Lv-NBC level by siRNA, the mortality of shrimp significantly increased under pH stress. Our study, as a whole, may provide evidences for the role of NBC in shrimp responding to pH stress, and give a new insight of the acid/base homeostasis mechanism in crustaceans.",

In teleost fish, however, the regulatory mechanism for leptin gene expression still remains unclear. In this study, we found that glucagon, a key hormone in glucose homeostasis, was effective at elevating the leptin-AI and leptin-AII transcript levels in goldfish liver via both in vivo intraperitoneal injection and in vitro cells incubation approaches. The responses of leptin-AI and leptin-AII mRNA to glucagon treatment were highly comparable. In contrast, blockade of local glucagon action could reduce the basal and induced leptin-AI and leptin-AII mRNA expression. The stimulation of leptin levels by glucagon was caused by the activation of adenylate cyclase (AC)/cyclic-AMP (cAMP)/ protein kinase A (PKA), and probably cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) cascades. Our study described the effect and signal transduction mechanism of glucagon on leptin gene expression in goldfish liver, and may also provide new insight into leptin as a mediator in the regulatory network of energy metabolism in the fish model.",

        "abstract": "Leptin is primarily considered a peripheral satiety hormone and is also found to perform important roles in energy homeostasis in vertebrates ranging from fish to mammals. The liver is a major source of leptin production in teleost fish. Using goldfish as a model, a previous report by our group illustrated the positive regulation of leptin mRNA levels by treatment with the hyperglycemic hormone glucagon, and our present study provided evidence for the negative regulation of hepatic leptin-AI and leptin-AII transcripts through the administration of the hypoglycemic hormone insulin. This study is the first to demonstrate changes in the hepatopancreatic insulin, glucagon, leptin-AI and leptin-AII mRNA levels in goldfish during fasting and refeeding. Insulin was found to be effective in suppressing leptin-AI and leptin-AII transcript levels in goldfish liver via both in vivo intraperitoneal injection and in vitro cell incubation approaches. Only the insulin receptor, not the IGF-I receptor, was involved in insulin-inhibited leptin mRNA level. The suppression of leptin levels by insulin was caused by the activation of MKK/pMAPK and MEK/Erk cascades. Insulin treatment could eliminate the stimulation of glucagon on leptin mRNA level. Our study describes the regulation and signal transduction mechanism of insulin on leptin mRNA levels in the goldfish liver, suggesting that the leptin function in fish is speculated to be not only an anorexigenic factor but also a metabolic mediator. This also supports the hypothesis that the poikilothermal fish use a passive survival strategy during the periods of food deprivation, which is mediated by the fish-specifically high leptin levels induced by the cooperation of insulin and glucagon.",

        "title": "Goldfish Leptin-AI and Leptin-AII: Function and Central Mechanism in Feeding Control.",
        "abstract": "In mammals, leptin is a peripheral satiety factor that inhibits feeding by regulating a variety of appetite-related hormones in the brain. However, most of the previous studies examining leptin in fish feeding were performed with mammalian leptins, which share very low sequence homologies with fish leptins. To elucidate the function and mechanism of endogenous fish leptins in feeding regulation, recombinant goldfish leptin-AI and leptin-AII were expressed in methylotrophic yeast and purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). By intraperitoneal (IP) injection, both leptin-AI and leptin-AII were shown to inhibit the feeding behavior and to reduce the food consumption of goldfish in 2 h. In addition, co-treatment of leptin-AI or leptin-AII could block the feeding behavior and reduce the food consumption induced by neuropeptide Y (NPY) injection. High levels of leptin receptor (lepR) mRNA were detected in the hypothalamus, telencephalon, optic tectum and cerebellum of the goldfish brain. The appetite inhibitory effects of leptins were mediated by downregulating the mRNA levels of orexigenic NPY, agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and orexin and upregulating the mRNA levels of anorexigenic cocaine-amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), cholecystokinin (CCK), melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in different areas of the goldfish brain. Our study, as a whole, provides new insights into the functions and mechanisms of leptins in appetite control in a fish model. ",

Here, we use the    j    \u211b    i    criterion, which takes into account both data misfit and the contribution from data noise, to determine dip angle. Synthetic tests show dip angle estimates with the    j    \u211b    i    criterion are more accurate and robust than those with data misfit minimization. We applied this    j    \u211b    i    criterion to the determination of the dip angle of the 2015  M   w   7.9 Gorkha Nepal earthquake using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Global Positioning System (GPS) data. The results show that the event ruptured to the north of Kathmandu with a maximum slip value of 5.8\u00a0m and a dip angle of 9.5\u00b0. We also calculated the coulomb failure stress changes resolved onto the receiver faults that are generally consistent with the fault geometry of this event, suggesting the possible triggering relation to aftershocks with low dip angles and a zone of seismic potential located to the west of the rupture zone.",

In ESISTEM approach, both surrounding InSAR and GPS measurements can be used as constraints in deriving surface displacements; while only surrounding GPS measurements are used in SISTEM approach. Besides the constraints from surrounding GPS measurements, the ESISTEM approach makes surrounding InSAR measurements available for constraining the derived deformations based on surface elastic theory for the first time. From the north to the south, derived surface displacement field shows prevailing southward horizontal deformations, and gradually varied vertical deformations ranging from \u22120.95 to 1.40 m within 120 km to the north of Kathmandu. This reveals that ruptures of Main Himalayan thrust (MHT) system were confined in subsurface and did not propagate to the Main Frontal Thrust (MFT) fault, in accordance with field investigation as well as geodetic and seismic studies. Relation between vertical deformations and earthquake-induced landslides is briefly discussed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   On 1st April 2007 a  M w   8.1 megathrust earthquake occurred in the western Solomon Islands of the Southwest Pacific and generated a regional tsunami with run-up heights of up to 12\u00a0m. A Bayesian inversion model is constructed to derive fault dip angle and cumulative co-seismic and early post-seismic slip using coral reef displacement measurements, in which both data misfit and moment magnitude are used as constraints. Results show three shallow, high-slip patches concentrated along the trench from west of Ranongga Island to Rendova Island on a fault plane dipping 20\u00b0, and a maximum dip slip of 11.6\u00a0m beneath Ranongga Island. Considerable subsidence on Simbo Island outboard of the trench on the subducting plate is not well explained with this model, but may be related to the effects of afterslip and/or Simbo Island\u2019s location near the triple junction among the Australia, Woodlark and Pacific plates.",

        "abstract": "The study was performed to investigate the role of sonic hedgehog (SHH) in the oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. The primary mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (MBMECs) were exposed to oxLDL. The results indicated that treatment of MBMECs with oxLDL decreased the cell viability, and oxidative stress was involved in oxLDL-induce MBMECs dysfunction with increasing intracellular ROS and MDA formation as well as decreasing NO release and eNOS mRNA expression. In addition, SHH signaling components, such as SHH, Smo and Gli1, mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased after incubation with increasing concentrations of oxLDL. Treatment with oxLDL alone or SHH loss-of-function significantly increased the permeability of MBMECs, and overexpression of SHH attenuated oxLDL-induced elevation of permeability in MBMECs. Furthermore, SHH gain-of-function could reverse oxLDL-induced apoptosis through inhibition caspase3 and caspase8 levels in MBMECs. Taken together, these results demonstrated that the suppression of SHH in MBMECs might contribute to the oxLDL-induced disruption of endothelial barrier. However, the overexpression of SHH could reverse oxLDL-induced endothelial cells dysfunction in vitro. ",

        "abstract": "Angiogenesis after ischemic stroke contributes to the restoration of blood supply in the ischemic zone. Strategies to improve angiogenesis may facilitate the function recovery after stroke. Growing evidence shows that proteasome inhibitors enhance angioneurogenesis and induces a long-term neuroprotection after cerebral ischemia in rodents' models. We have previously reported that inhibition of the immunoproteasome subunit low molecular mass peptide 2 (LMP2) offers a strong neuroprotection in ischemic stroke rats. However, thereareno dataavailable to show the relationship between immunoproteasome and angiogenesis under ischemia stroke context. In this study, we identified that inhibition of immunoproteasome LMP2 was able to enhance angiogenesis and facilitate neurological functional recovery in rats after focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. In vitro, oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) significantly enhanced the expression of immunoproteasome LMP2 and proteasome activities in primary culture astrocytes, but these beneficial effects were abolished by knockdown of LMP2 with siRNA tranfection. Along with this, protein abundance of HIF-1\u03b1 was significantly increased by inhibition LMP2 in vivo and in vitro and was associated with angiogenesis and cell fates. However, these beneficial effects were partly abolished by HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME).Taken together; this study highlights an important role for inhibition of LMP2 in promoting angiogenesis events in ischemic stroke, and point to HIF-1\u03b1 as a key mediator of this response, suggesting that immunoproteasome inhibitors may be a promising strategy for stroke treatment.",

        "abstract": "Hypertension is highly prevalent in low-income population. This study aims to investigate ethnic disparities in hypertension and identify modifiable factors related to its occurrence and control in developing regions in South China. Blood pressure was measured in the Bouyei and Han populations during a community-based health survey in Guizhou, 2012. A multistage stratified sampling method was adopted to recruit Bouyei and Han aged from 20 to 80 years. Taking mixed effects into consideration, multilevel logistic models with random intercept were used for data analysis. The prevalence rates of hypertension were 35.3% for the Bouyei and 33.7% for the Han. Among the hypertensive participants, 30.1% of the Bouyei and 40.2% of the Han were aware of their hypertensive conditions, 19.7% of the Bouyei and 31.1% of the Han were receiving treatment, and only 3.6% of the Bouyei and 9.9% of the Han had their blood pressure under control. Age-sex standardized rates of awareness, treatment, and control were consistently lower in the Bouyei than the Han. Such ethnic disparities were more evident in the elderly population. Avoidance of excessive alcohol consumption and better education were favorable lifestyle for reduction in risk of hypertension. Moderate physical activity improved control of hypertension in Bouyei patients under treatment. Conclusively, hypertension awareness, treatment, and control were substantially lower in Bouyei than Han, particularly in the elderly population. Such ethnic disparities indicate that elderly Bouyei population should be targeted for tailored interventions in the future.",

The effects were assessed with the pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity between studies was evaluated with the Q-statistic test. Publication bias was tested with Begg's and Egger's linear regression tests. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were performed to identify the sources of heterogeneity.In the present meta-analysis, 2,529 individuals with high myopia and 3,127 controls from four studies were included and divided into seven groups. The results indicated that RASGRF1 rs8027411 was significantly associated with high myopia in Chinese and Japanese populations. Carriers of the rs8027411 G allele had a lower risk of high myopia compared to carriers with the T allele (G versus T, OR=0.83, 95% CI=0.77-0.89; p<0.001). Low but not significant heterogeneity was found in a recessive model. No heterogeneity was found in other genetic models. The subgroup analysis indicated that the protective effect of rs8027411 variants was more prominent in Chinese populations (G versus T, OR=0.80 in Chinese and OR=0.86 in Japanese; GG versus TT, OR=0.65 in Chinese and OR=0.77 in Japanese; GT versus TT, OR=0.76 in Chinese and OR=0.81 in Japanese; (GG+GT) versus TT, OR=0.73 in Chinese and OR=0.80 in Japanese; and GG versus (GT+TT), OR=0.77 in Chinese and OR=0.87 in Japanese). Sensitivity analysis indicated that the study results were stable in allelic, homozygote, heterozygote, and dominant models but were not stable in the recessive model. No evidence of publication bias was found.Carriers of the rs8027411 G allele in the RASGRF1 gene may be at a lower risk of high myopia in Chinese and Japanese populations. The RASGRF1 gene may play a role in the development of high myopia, especially in Asians. Additional studies are required to validate these results.",

        "abstract": "T-20 (enfuvirtide) is the only approved viral fusion inhibitor, which is used for treatment of HIV-1 infection; however, it has relatively low antiviral activity and easily induces drug resistance. We recently reported a T-20-based lipopeptide fusion inhibitor (LP-40) showing improved anti-HIV activity (Ding  J Virol, 2017). In this study, we designed LP-50 and LP-51 by refining the structure and function of LP-40. Two new lipopeptides showed dramatically enhanced secondary structures and binding stability and were exceptionally potent inhibitors of HIV-1, HIV-2, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and simian-human chimeric virus (SHIV), with mean IC values at very low picomolar concentrations. They also exhibited dramatically increased potencies in inhibiting a panel of T-20 and LP-40-resistant mutant viruses. In line with their  data, LP-50 and LP-51 exhibited extremely potent and long-lasting  anti-HIV activities in rhesus monkeys, with serum dilution peaks that inhibited 50% virus infection being >15,200-fold higher than T-20 and LP-40. A low-dose, short-term monotherapy of LP-51 could sharply reduce viral loads to undetectable levels in acutely and chronically SHIV-infected monkey models. In our knowledge, LP-50 and LP-51 are the most potent and broad HIV-1/2 and SIV fusion inhibitors, which can be developed for clinical use and serve as tools to explore the mechanisms of viral entry and inhibition. T-20 remains the only membrane fusion inhibitor available for treatment of viral infection, but its relatively low anti-HIV and genetic barrier for drug resistance have significantly limited its clinical application. Herein, we report two new lipopeptide-based fusion inhibitors (LP-50 and LP-51) showing extremely potent inhibitory activities against diverse HIV-1, HIV-2, SIV, and T-20-resistant variants. Promisingly, both inhibitors exhibited a potent and long-lasting  anti-HIV activity and could efficiently suppress viral loads at undetectable levels in SHIV-infected monkey models. We believe that they are the most potent and broad-spectrum fusion inhibitors known to date and thus have high potential for clinical development.",

        "abstract": "Peptides derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) fusogenic protein gp41 are potent viral entry inhibitors, and currently, enfuvirtide (T-20) is the only one approved for clinical use; however, emerging drug resistance largely limits its efficacy. In this study, we generated a novel lipopeptide inhibitor, named LP-19, by integrating multiple design strategies, including an N-terminal M-T hook structure, an HIV-2 sequence, intrahelical salt bridges, and a membrane-anchoring lipid tail. LP-19 showed stable binding affinity and highly potent, broad, and long-lasting antiviral activity. In  studies, LP-19 efficiently inhibited HIV-1-, HIV-2-, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-mediated cell fusion, viral entry, and infection, and it was highly active against diverse subtypes of primary HIV-1 isolates and inhibitor-resistant mutants.  studies demonstrated that LP-19 exhibited dramatically increased anti-HIV activity and an extended half-life in rhesus macaques. In short-term monotherapy, LP-19 reduced viral loads to undetectable levels in acutely and chronically simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-infected monkeys. Therefore, this study offers an ideal HIV-1/2 fusion inhibitor for clinical development and emphasizes the importance of the viral fusion step as a drug target. The peptide drug T-20 is the only viral fusion inhibitor in the clinic, which is used for combination therapy of HIV-1 infection; however, it requires a high dosage and easily induces drug resistance, calling for a new drug with significantly improved pharmaceutical profiles. Here, we have developed a short-lipopeptide-based fusion inhibitor, termed LP-19, which mainly targets the conserved gp41 pocket site and shows highly potent inhibitory activity against HIV-1, HIV-2, and even SIV isolates. LP-19 exhibits dramatically increased antiviral activity and an extended half-life in rhesus macaques, and it has potent therapeutic efficacy in SHIV-infected monkeys, highlighting its high potential as a new viral fusion inhibitor for clinical use.",

        "abstract": "Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) dramatically improves survival of HIV-infected patients, but lifelong treatment can ultimately result in cumulative toxicities and drug resistance, thus necessitating the development of new drugs with significantly improved pharmaceutical profiles. We recently found that the fusion inhibitor T-20 (enfuvirtide)-based lipopeptides possess dramatically increased anti-HIV activity. Herein, a group of novel lipopeptides were designed with different lengths of fatty acids, identifying a stearic acid-modified lipopeptide (LP-80) with the most potent anti-HIV activity. It inhibited a large panel of divergent HIV subtypes with a mean IC50 in the extremely low picomolar range, being > 5,300-fold more active than T-20 and the neutralizing antibody VRC01. It also sustained the potent activity against T-20-resistant mutants and exhibited very high therapeutic selectivity index. Pharmacokinetics of LP-80 in rats and monkeys verified its potent and long-acting anti-HIV activity. In the monkey, subcutaneous administration of 3 mg/kg LP-80 yielded serum concentrations of 1,147 ng/ml after injection 72 h and 9 ng/ml after injection 168 h (7 days), equivalent to 42,062- and 330-fold higher than the measured IC50 value. In SHIV infected rhesus macaques, a single low-dose LP-80 (3 mg/kg) sharply reduced viral loads to below the limitation of detection, and twice-weekly monotherapy could maintain long-term viral suppression.",

        "abstract": "HIV-1-infected macrophages are a key contributor to the formation of a viral reservoir and new treatment strategies focus on eliminating this pool of virus. Galectin-3 is a potent apoptosis-inducing protein that regulates diverse cellular activities. In the present study, we investigated whether galectin-3 could induce cell death in HIV-1-infected macrophages using HIV-1-infected THP1 monocytes (THP1-MNs) and THP1-derived macrophages (THP1-M\u03a6s) as in vitro cellular models. We found that THP1-M\u03a6s were more resistant than the THP1-MNs to HIV-1 infection-induced death, and that HIV-1 infection of the THP1-M\u03a6s increased expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Additionally, galectin-3 but not FasL, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand or TNF-\u03b1, could induce cell death in HIV-1-infected THP1-M\u03a6s. A similar result was shown for primary human monocyte-derived macrophages. Galectin-3-induced cell death was also significantly increased in macrophages obtained from SIVmac251-infected macaques compared to that of macrophages from healthy macaques. Furthermore, galectin-3-induced cell death in HIV-1-infected THP1-M\u03a6s was caspase independent. Interestingly, endonuclease G (Endo G) was increased in the nucleus and decreased in the cytoplasm of galectin-3-treated cells; thus, galectin-3-induced cell death in HIV-1-infected THP1-M\u03a6s is most likely related to the translocation of Endo G from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. These findings suggest that galectin-3 may potentially aid in the eradication of HIV-1/SIV-infected macrophages.",

        "abstract": "A series of 6,7-disubstituted-4-phenoxyquinoline derivatives bearing the 1,8-naphthyridin-2-one moiety were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their biological activities. The target compounds exhibited moderate to high antiproliferative activity against three cancer cell lines (A549, HepG2 and MCF-7) and several compounds (25, 27, 33, 37, 41, 43, 49 and 53) were evaluated for the activity against c-Met kinase. The most promising compound 33 (IC c-Met\u202f=\u202f2.36\u202fnM) showed excellent activity against A549, HepG2 and MCF-7\u202fcell lines with IC values of 0.23\u202f\u03bcM, 0.42\u202f\u03bcM and 0.21\u202f\u03bcM, respectively, which was 1.5-2.1 times of the positive control. Furthermore, compound 33 was evaluated for the activity against Flt3, PDGFR-\u03b1, PDGFR-\u03b2, c-Kit, Flt4, ALK and EGFR kinase. Structure activity relationship studies indicated that mono-EWGs (such as R\u202f=\u202fF) at 4-position of moiety C was a key factor in improving the antitumor activity. In addition, further research on compound 33 was mainly including concentration dependence, apoptosis (acridine orange staining), apoptosis result analyzing and molecular docking.",

They reduce the abundance of the eIF2\u00b7GTP\u00b7tRNA(i)(Met) ternary complex and inhibit cancer cell proliferation. An optimization process was undertaken to improve their solubility while preserving their biological activity. Non-symmetrical hybrid ureas were generated by combining one of the hydrophobic phenyl moieties present in the symmetrical ureas with the polar 3-hydroxy-tolyl moiety. O-alkylation of the later added potentially solubilizing charge bearing groups. The new non-symmetrical N,N'-diarylureas were characterized by ternary complex reporter gene and cell proliferation assays, demonstrating good bioactivities. A representative sample of these compounds potently induced phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and expression of CHOP at the protein and mRNA levels. These inhibitors of translation initiation may become leads for the development of potent, non-toxic, and target specific anti-cancer agents.",

        "abstract": "The prevalence of invasive Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) within the serrated neoplasia pathway of the proximal colon has seldom been investigated. We examined the invasive Fn and bacterial biofilms in 35 proximal hyperplastic polyps (HPs), 33 sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs), 48 proximal colorectal cancers (CRCs) and 10 matched metastatic lymph nodes using 16S rRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Samples of normal mucosa, traditional adenomas (TAs), distal HPs, distal CRCs and matched lymph nodes with or without metastases were used as controls. The prevalence of invasive Fn within proximal HPs (65.7%) and SSAs (78.8%) were significantly higher than that of proximal TAs (28.9%) and distal TAs (24.4%; p\u2009<\u20090.05). Invasive Fn was detected in markedly more proximal CRCs (89.6%) than in distal CRCs (42.2%; p\u2009<\u20090.05). Moreover, invasive Fn was detected in a significantly higher proportion of matched metastatic lymph nodes (100%) than that within nonmetastatic lymph nodes (40.0%; p\u2009<\u20090.001). Bacterial biofilms were found on 52.1% of proximal CRCs, 55.6% of distal CRCs and 48.5% of SSAs. Biofilms were positive for Fn in 47.9% of proximal CRCs, 48.9% of distal CRCs and 27.3% of SSAs. However, the presence of Fn in biofilms was not related to invasive Fn within colorectal tissues (p\u2009=\u20090.415). Invasive Fn may play a role in the carcinogenesis of proximal colon developing via the serrated neoplasia pathway, but might have a less important role in the TA-carcinoma sequence. Bacterial biofilms may not contribute to the invasion of Fn into tumor tissues.",

        "abstract": "The underlying mechanism of Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) in the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC) is poorly understood. Here, we examined Fn abundance in CRC tissues, as well as \u03b2-catenin, TLR4 and PAK1 protein abundance in Fn positive and Fn negative CRCs. Furthermore, we isolated a strain of Fn (F01) from a CRC tissue and examined whether Fn (F01) infection of colon cancer cells activated \u03b2-catenin signaling via the TLR4/P-PAK1/P-\u03b2-catenin S675 cascade. Invasive Fn was abundant in 62.2% of CRC tissues. TLR4, PAK1 and nuclear \u03b2-catenin proteins were more abundant within Fn-positive over Fn-negative CRCs (P < 0.05). Fn and its lipopolysaccharide induced a significant increase in TLR4/P-PAK1/P-\u03b2-catenin S675/C-myc/CyclinD1 protein abundance, as well as in the nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin. Furthermore, inhibition of TLR4 or PAK1 prior to challenge with Fn significantly decreased protein abundance of P-\u03b2-catenin S675, C-myc and Cyclin D1, as well as nuclear \u03b2-catenin accumulation. Inhibition of TLR4 significantly decreased P-PAK1 protein abundance, and for the first time, we observed an interaction between TLR4 and P-PAK1 using immunoprecipitation. Our data suggest that invasive Fn activates \u03b2-catenin signaling via a TLR4/P-PAK1/P-\u03b2-catenin S675 cascade in CRC. Furthermore, TLR4 and PAK1 could be potential pharmaceutical targets for the treatment of Fn-related CRCs.",

        "abstract": "Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) in the tumor microenvironment plays an important role in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). The underlying mechanism of action, however, remains to be elucidated. We evaluated the relation of F. nucleatum amount to thymocyte selection-associated high-mobility group box (TOX) protein expression and CD4 T cell density in 138 human colorectal tissues. TOX expression and CD4 T cell density in F. nucleatum negative tissues were significantly higher compared to those in F. nucleatum positive tissues (P < 0.001, P = 0.002, respectively). We found a negative correlation between F. nucleatum abundance and TOX expression (P < 0.001), and CD4 T cell density (P < 0.001). TOX expression in normal mucosa, hyperplastic polyps and adenomas was significantly higher than in sessile serrated adenomas and different stages of carcinomas (P < 0.05). Moreover, CD4 T cell density in high TOX expression tissues was significantly higher than in low TOX expression tissues (P = 0.003). A positive correlation was found between TOX expression and CD4 T cell density in colorectal tissues (Spearman correlation coefficients 0.362, 95%CI 0.051-0.641, P = 0.022). Our findings suggest that F. nucleatum may suppress anti-tumor immune responses by decreasing CD4 T cell density and TOX expression in the progression of CRC.",

        "abstract": "Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) has been shown to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) development by inhibiting host anti-tumour immunity. However, the impact of Fn infection on macrophage polarization and subsequent intestinal tumour formation as well as the underlying molecular pathways has not been investigated. We investigated the impact of Fn infection on macrophage polarization in human CRCs and cultured macrophages as well as the effects on macrophage phenotype and intestinal tumour formation in Apc mice. We also examined whether macrophage-polarized activation challenged by Fn infection via a TLR4-dependent mechanism involved the IL-6/STAT3/c-MYC signalling cascade. Our data showed that macrophages are a major tumour-infiltrating immune cell type in human CRCs with Fn infection (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Fn infection increased M2 polarization of macrophages in vitro and in vivo, leading to intestinal tumour growth in Apc mice. Moreover, Fn infection induced high expression of TLR4, IL-6, STAT3, p-STAT3, and c-MYC in cultured macrophages challenged with Fn, which was blocked by TAK-242 pre-treatment (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Interestingly, c-MYC protein was mainly co-localized with CD206 M2 macrophages with Fn infection. In conclusion, we show that Fn infection increased M2 polarization of macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Fn infection enhanced colorectal tumour growth in a TLR4-dependent manner involving activation of the IL-6/p-STAT3/c-MYC signalling pathway. For the first time, our results indicate an immunosuppressive effect of Fn by promoting M2 polarization of macrophages through a TLR4-dependent mechanism, which may serve as a promising target for immunotherapy of Fn-related CRC.",

Large-scale techniques have generated many valuable protein-protein interaction datasets that are useful for the study of protein function. Combining both GO and protein-protein interaction data allows the prediction of function for unknown proteins.We apply a Markov random field method to the prediction of yeast protein function based on multiple protein-protein interaction datasets. We assign function to unknown proteins with a probability representing the confidence of this prediction. The functions are based on three general categories of cellular component, molecular function and biological process defined in GO. The yeast proteins are defined in the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD). The protein-protein interaction datasets are obtained from the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS), including physical interactions and genetic interactions. The efficiency of our prediction is measured by applying the leave-one-out validation procedure to a functional path matching scheme, which compares the prediction with the GO description of a protein's function from the abstract level to the detailed level along the GO structure. For biological process, the leave-one-out validation procedure shows 52% precision and recall of our method, much better than that of the simple guilty-by-association methods.",

        "abstract": "As more and more high-throughput protein-protein interaction data are collected, the task of estimating the reliability of different data sets becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we present our study of two groups of protein-protein interaction data, the physical interaction data and the protein complex data, and estimate the reliability of these data sets using three different measurements: (1) the distribution of gene expression correlation coefficients, (2) the reliability based on gene expression correlation coefficients, and (3) the accuracy of protein function predictions. We develop a maximum likelihood method to estimate the reliability of protein interaction data sets according to the distribution of correlation coefficients of gene expression profiles of putative interacting protein pairs. The results of the three measurements are consistent with each other. The MIPS protein complex data have the highest mean gene expression correlation coefficients (0.256) and the highest accuracy in predicting protein functions (70% sensitivity and specificity), while Ito's Yeast two-hybrid data have the lowest mean (0.041) and the lowest accuracy (15% sensitivity and specificity). Uetz's data are more reliable than Ito's data in all three measurements, and the TAP protein complex data are more reliable than the HMS-PCI data in all three measurements as well. The complex data sets generally perform better in function predictions than do the physical interaction data sets. Proteins in complexes are shown to be more highly correlated in gene expression. The results confirm that the components of a protein complex can be assigned to functions that the complex carries out within a cell. There are three interaction data sets different from the above two groups: the genetic interaction data, the in-silico data and the syn-express data. Their capability of predicting protein functions generally falls between that of the Y2H data and that of the MIPS protein complex data.

        "abstract": "The formation, breakage, and re-growth of flocs were investigated by using modified flocculation tests and numerical simulation to explore the evolution of floc morphology for different hydraulic retention times. The shorter the aggregation time was, the smaller the flocs produced for the same hydraulic conditions were. Another interesting discovery was that broken flocs that formed in shorter aggregation time had the capacity to completely recover, whereas those formed in a longer amount of time had rather worse reversibility of broken flocs. With the addition of the maximum motion step in the representative two-dimensional diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) model, there was a transition for flocs from isotropic to anisotropic as the maximum motion step increased. The strength of flocs was mainly affected by the distribution of particles near the aggregated core rather than distant particles. A simplified breakage model, which found that broken flocs provided more chances for diffused particles to access the inner parts of flocs and to be uniformly packed around the aggregated core, was first proposed. Moreover, an important result showed that the floc fragments formed with a larger value of the maximum motion step had more growing sites than did those with a smaller msa value, which was a benefit of following the re-forming procedure.",

By optimizing the thickness and width of the electrodes, we improved the trapping ability and trap scalability. By using some practical experimental operation methods, we successfully minimized the trap heating rate. Consequently, we could trap a string of up to 38 ions, and a zigzag structure with 24 ions, and transport two trapped ions to different zones. We also studied the influences of the ion chip surface on the ion lifetime. The excellent trapping ability and flexibility of operation of the planar ion trap shows that it has high feasibility for application in the development a practical quantum information processor or quantum simulator.",

        "abstract": "Scaling up the number of trapped ions and effective cooling ions in surface ion traps is a central challenge in the research of trapped-ion systems. In this paper, we propose a novel surface ion trap design that enables innate principle-axes rotation of trapped ions. In the manipulation zone of our chip, a symmetric seven-wire geometry enables the rotation of principal axes of two parallel linear ion strings. This can be used to ensure the efficient laser cooling of the trapped ions. Furthermore, to avoid electrode surface adsorbates or other pollution from occurring during the loading process, we design a standard five-wire geometry for the loading zone and a Y-junction to connect loading zone and manipulation zone. A multi-objective optimisation procedure suitable for arbitrary junctions is described in detail, and the corresponding optimisation results for all ingredients of our chip are presented. With this multi-functional ion trap design and innate principle axes rotation, the proposed design can be useful in the construction of large-scale ion chip quantum processors with low heating rates and is also the high efficiency ion beam splitter and multi-ion-mixer. the trap has potential applications in precision measurements and quantum metrology.",

The composite was characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The Cu\u2013BTC deposited on the BNNTs had an average grain size of 80\u00a0nm. The sensing performance of the as-grown product was studied for different concentrations of CH 4  (20\u2013200\u00a0ppm) at 150\u00a0\u00b0C. The results revealed that the Cu\u2013BTC/BNNT composite exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity toward CH 4 . The good sensing performance of the composite was attributed to the high surface area and high affinity of Cu\u2013BTC for CH 4 , which would allow the composite to act like a preconcentrator for CH 4  gas sensing.",

Using the computer algebra system, we compute the first six singular point values for the travelling wave system, and we prove that the reaction-diffusion equation has at most 6 SAIPWT.

Ten patients (20 eyes) with TMD treated in the Department of Ophthalmology, Xiangya Hospital, and 10 healthy controls (20 eyes) were included in the current study. A detailed slit lamp microscopy, anterior segment photography, and corneal IVCM examination were performed for each eye. The density of central and marginal corneal epithelial cells, stromal cells, and subepithelial nerve fibers was compared between the two groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Compared with the control group, the corneal epithelial and endothelial cells in the TMD group showed granular highly reflective substances and thinner subepithelial nerve fibers. The uneven dot-like highly reflective substances without cell structures appeared in the stromal layer of the cornea. The density of central and marginal corneal epithelial cells, stromal cells, and subepithelial nerve fibers was lower in the TMD group ( < 0.05), and they were negatively correlated with severity of the disease ( < 0.05). Our study demonstrated that the density of corneal epithelial cells, stromal cells, and sensory plexus nerve fibers was significantly reduced in the TMD group. The pathological changes were more obvious in the marginal cornea, and it is correlated with severity of the disease.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of exome sequencing in recent years has enabled rapid and cost-effective detection of genetic variants in coding regions and offers a great opportunity to combine sequencing experiments with subsequent computational analysis for dissecting genetic basis of human inherited diseases. However, this strategy, though successful in practice, still faces such challenges as limited sample size and substantial number or diversity of candidate variants. To overcome these obstacles, researchers have been concentrated in the development of advanced computational methods and have recently achieved great progress for analysing single nucleotide variant. Nevertheless, it still remains unclear on how to analyse indels, another type of genetic variant that accounts for substantial proportion of known disease-causing variants. In this paper, we proposed an integrative method to effectively identify disease-causing indels from exome sequencing data. Specifically, we put forward a statistical method to combine five functional prediction scores, four genic association scores and a genic intolerance score to produce an integrated p-value, which could then be used for prioritizing candidate indels. We performed extensive simulation studies and demonstrated that our method achieved high accuracy in uncovering disease-causing indels.

        "abstract": "Anesthesiology has reached a new stage which anaesthesia safety is significantly affected by human factors. The number of Chinese anaesthetists has increased to nearly twice as many as that in 2005. Attributed to traditional concepts, many problems in anesthesiology persist in Chinese hospitals. This study aims to determine the current status of anaesthesia job burnout, including problems related to burnout, as well as the conditions of anaesthesia human resources in Chinese hospitals.A multi-center, cross-sectional survey of 395 anaesthetists from 60 hospitals in 6 provinces was conducted to collect data on the work conditions of anesthesiologists by using questionnaires. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was used to measure burnout. Different statistical models were also used to evaluate the data.The number of Chinese anaesthetists has increased to nearly twice as many as that in 2005. According to our field survey of burnout among anaesthetists, only 17 (4.30%) respondents exhibited high levels of burnout. The average scores corresponding to the dimensions of burnout are 14.64 \u00b1 11.40 (emotional exhaustion, EE), 4.22 \u00b1 5.74 (depersonalization, DP), and 33.41 \u00b1 10.05 (personal accomplishment, PA), as determined by MBI. These results indicate the differences in the spatial distribution of anaesthetists. Moreover, 15.3% of the anaesthetists showed high EE, 8.1% exhibited high DP, and 33.6% had low PA.Anxiety and undesirable conditions experienced by professional groups in anaesthesiology need to be addressed. Educational level, an important factor in anaesthesia care, influences not only psychological health of practitioners but patient safety as well. Thus, personnel structure must be optimized to relieve tension in the practice of the profession and reduce burnout among anaesthetists in hospitals in China. Meanwhile, the management must increase its effort toward improving the mental health of practitioners and patient safety in anaesthesia care.",

        "title": "Factors affecting turnover intentions among public hospital doctors in a middle-level city in central China.",
        "abstract": "Objective The aim of the present study was to explore prominent factors affecting turnover intentions among public hospital doctors in urban areas, particularly in Xiangyang City, Hubei Province, a middle-level city in central China. Methods Questionnaires were used to collect data from 284 public hospital doctors. Pearson's Chi-squared was used to assess whether sociodemographic and other factors were related to the turnover intentions of public hospital doctors. Binary logistic regression was performed to determine the significant factors that influence turnover intentions. Results The analysis revealed that 28.2% of public hospital doctors intended to leave the hospital where they were currently employed. Dissatisfaction with working conditions and hospital management processes, as well as work pressures, were significant factors contributing to the turnover intentions of public hospital doctors. Conclusion Research into turnover intentions indicates that public hospital doctors surveyed in urban China give greater weight to their professional environment and career development rather than salary in their employment decisions. What is known about the topic? Turnover of medical staff is a concern to hospital administrators because it is costly and detrimental to organisational performance and quality of care. Most studies have focused on the effects of individual and organisational factors on nurses' intentions to leave their employment. Income dissatisfaction was one of the determining factors of turnover intentions in previous studies. What does this paper add? The satisfaction of public hospital doctors with regard to income is not a determining factor of turnover intentions. In contrast with findings of previous studies, the doctors in public hospitals in urban China in the present study gave greater weight to their professional environment and career development in their employment decisions. What are the implications for practitioners? The findings suggest that health service managers and policy makers should pay greater attention to the factors affecting public hospital doctors' turnover intentions. This study will be useful for optimising public hospital management and minimising the turnover of doctors in China.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Metal-doped magnesium ferrites (Mg, Ni)(Fe, Al) 2 O 4  were prepared by a hydrothermal method from saprolitic nickel laterite leaching solution. The effects of the hydrothermal reaction temperature (140\u2013220\u2009\u00b0C) and post calcination on the microstructure and catalytic performance of the as-prepared samples were investigated in detail. It is shown that higher hydrothermal temperature combined with calcination could promote the migration of Fe 3+  from tetrahedral to octahedral sites almost exclusively located at the surface of the solid spinel ferrites, which was beneficial to improve the activity of formed MgFe 2 O 4  catalysts. In addition, the calcined samples (hydrothermal synthesized at 180, 200 and 220\u2009\u00b0C, then calcined at 500\u2009\u00b0C (H 180 C, H 200 C and H 220 C)) exhibited excellent heterogeneous Fenton-like catalytic activity for decomposing Rhodamine B (about 97.0% degradation efficiency in 120\u2009min). Moreover, reusability test results show that the reduction of degradation efficiency was less than 1.0% for the sample H 200 C, implying the as-prepared catalyst had good catalytic activity and excellent reusability. This study may provide a better understanding of relationships between microstructure and heterogeneous Fenton-like catalytic performance of spinel ferrites synthesized from natural minerals containing transition metals.",

The influence of reaction temperature on the catalytic process was centrally discussed based on the hydroxyl radical theory. The as-prepared MgFe 2 O 4  exhibited favorable catalytic activity for degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB), achieving 97.8% degradation efficiency of 10\u202fmg\u00b7L \u22121  RhB within 300\u202fmin (90.0% degradation, 180\u202fmin) at the conditions of 45\u202f\u00b0C, pH\u202f6.44, 0.625\u202fg\u00b7L \u22121  catalyst dosage and 1.00\u202fvol% H 2 O 2  concentration. And the TOC removal efficiency could reach 77.8%. After five consecutive degradation cycles, the reduction of degradation and TOC removal efficiencies were  2 O 4  had high catalytic activity, good stability and excellent reusability.

        "abstract": "Objective  As the most populous city in China, Shanghai has 24.4\u2009million resident population, 6.5\u2009million of whom are motor vehicle drivers. According to the Traffic police, 868 people died due to road traffic crashes in 2016 in Shanghai. Wearing a seatbelt reduces the risk of death in the event of a crash by 50% for front seat occupants and 75% for rear seat occupants. Chinese traffic laws require seatbelt use for all occupants, but difficulty with enforcement has resulted in low compliance rate. Shanghai police started using high-resolution cameras and object-detection algorithm in seatbelt enforcement since early 2016. Our objective is to assess the level and trend of seatbelt use in Shanghai.  Methods  Data are collected at eight randomly selected locations throughout the city. The sites were picked to allow for a range of road types (elevated and ground, urban and peri-urban, varying speed limits) and geographic locations. Data collection covers most times of the day on both weekday and weekend. This allows a full representation of varying traffic models during both rush hours and non-rush hours. At each site, trained field workers from Shanghai CDC observed seatbelt use of occupants in all passing motor vehicles.  Findings  We have completed five rounds of data collection with a total sample size of 57\u2009639 drivers and passengers. The seatbelt use rate has been consistently increasing over time, from 60.8% in round 1% to 81.4% in round 5. The increase is substantial and statistically significant for both drivers and passengers. The seatbelt use was more than twice higher among drivers than passengers, but the ratio of driver over passenger wearing rate has been declining, which implies that the passenger use rate is catching up. Females are more likely to wear seatbelt than males. 95.7% of female drivers and 71.2% female passengers use seatbelt, compared to 94.4% for male drivers and 39.6% for male passengers.  Conclusion and policy implications  Seatbelt use has been boosted by the deployment of computer vision technology in enforcement. Other cities in China and other countries facing similar challenges with seatbelt enforcement may learn from Shanghai\u2019s experience.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Novel Li 2 ZnSn 2 O 6 :Mn 4+  (LZSO:Mn 4+ ) phosphor is prepared by the high temperature solid-state reaction method in air. The X-ray powder diffractions of samples with a hexagonal LZSO crystal system are investigated. Excitation spectrum of LZSO:Mn 4+  phosphor monitored at 658\u202fnm shows these excitation bands in the range of 220 \u2212 570\u202fnm, which are attributed to the Mn 4+  - O 2\u2212  charge transfer band (220 \u2212 300\u202fnm), the  4 A 2  \u2192  4 T 1  transition of Mn 4+  ion (300 \u2212 420\u202fnm), and  4 A 2  \u2192  4 T 2  transition of Mn 4+  ion (420 \u2212 570\u202fnm), respectively. LZSO:Mn 4+  phosphor with excitation at 335 and 480\u202fnm emits deep-red light with the strongest emission peak at ~ 658\u202fnm in the range of 600 \u2212 780\u202fnm due to the  2 E \u2192  4 A 2  transition of Mn 4+  ion. The optimal Mn 4+  concentration is ~ 0.4% in LZSO:Mn 4+  phosphor. The lifetime of LZSO:Mn 4+  phosphor decreases from 14.32 to 12.05\u202f\u03bcs with increasing Mn 4+  concentration from 0.2% to 1.0%. The luminous mechanism and energy level splitting of Mn 4+  ion in LZSO:Mn 4+  phosphor are explained by the Tanabe-Sugano energy level diagram.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A new non-rare-earth deep-red-emitting Na 2 MgAl 10 O 17 :Mn 4+  phosphor is prepared successfully by high temperature solid-state reaction method in air. All samples are a single pure phase, which is confirmed by X-ray powder diffractions patterns. Excitation spectrum shows some absorption bands in the range of 220\u2013600\u00a0nm, which are line with the wavelength of ultraviolet (UV), near UV, and blue light-emitting diode chips. Deep-red emission of Na 2 MgAl 10 O 17 :Mn 4+  phosphor with excitation UV, near UV, and blue light can be observed in the range of 600\u2013810\u00a0nm due to the  2 E \u2192  4 A 2  transition of Mn 4+  ion in octahedral symmetry with aided the lattice vibration. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) is \u223c105\u00a0nm. The optimal Mn 4+  concentration is \u223c1%. Decay curve and time-resolved spectra indicate that there is only a Mn 4+  ion luminescent center in Na 2 MgAl 10 O 17 :Mn 4+  phosphor. The thermal stability is investigated and analyzed by the configuration coordinate diagram of Mn 4+  ion.",

Emission band peaking at ~ 588 nm of LiBaPO4:Bi3+ phosphor in the range of 400\u2013790 nm is attributed to the 3P1 \u2192 1S0 electron transition of Bi3+ ion.

Time resolved spectra and fluorescence lifetime data confirm that there is only Bi3+ ion luminous center in LiBaPO4:Bi3+ phosphor.

Na 2 Ca 2 Nb 4 O 13 :Eu 3+  phosphor emits red light with the chromaticity coordinates (0.6312, 0.3684) and the emission spectrum is observed in the range of 575\u2013725\u202fnm, which contains four emission bands because of the  5 D 0  \u2192  7 F 1  (575\u2013600\u202fnm),  5 D 0  \u2192  7 F 2  (600\u2013650\u202fnm),  5 D 0  \u2192  7 F 3  (650\u2013670\u202fnm),  5 D 0  \u2192  7 F 4  (680\u2013725\u202fnm) transitions of Eu 3+  ion, respectively. The optimal Eu 3+  ion concentration in Na 2 Ca 2 Nb 4 O 13 :Eu 3+  phosphor is ~10\u202fmol%. The lifetime decreases in turn from 736.5\u202f\u03bcs to 431.8\u202f\u03bcs with increasing Eu 3+  ion concentration from 2\u202fmol% to 12\u202fmol%. Na 2 Ca 2 Nb 4 O 13 :Eu 3+  phosphor has a good thermal stability according to the temperature-dependent emission spectra. Luminous mechanism is explained by energy level diagram of Eu 3+  ion. The experimental results indicate that Na 2 Ca 2 Nb 4 O 13 :Eu 3+  phosphor has a hope to be used as red phosphor for light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on near ultraviolet (UV) and blue LED chips.",

Monitored at 678\u00a0nm, the excitation spectrum of Ba 2 LaSbO 6 :Mn 4+  phosphor is observed in the range of 250 \u2212 575\u00a0nm. Under the excitation of 380\u00a0nm, Ba 2 LaSbO 6 :Mn 4+  phosphor exhibits strong deep-red emission in the range of 625 \u2212 740\u00a0nm with emission peak at 678\u00a0nm due to the  2 E \u2192  4 A 2  transition of Mn 4+  ion. The emission spectrum well matchs with the absorption spectrum of plants in the range of 625 \u2212 740\u00a0nm. The temperature-dependent emission spectra illustrate the thermal stability of Ba 2 LaSbO 6 :Mn 4+  phosphor and the thermal quenching mechanism is explained by the configuration coordinate of Mn 4+  ion. The luminous mechanism of Ba 2 LaSbO 6 :Mn 4+  phosphor is explained by the Tanabe-Sugano energy level diagram of Mn 4+  ion. The experimental results show that the Ba 2 LaSbO 6 :Mn 4+  deep-red-emitting phosphor would have potential application in plant growth LEDs.",

Moreover, the thin thickness of the nanosheet in comparison to the electron depletion layer is also found to account for the improved gas-sensing properties. The findings demonstrate advance of the hierarchical nanostructures in further enhancing gas-sensing properties, and such facile method could be applied to produce many other gas-sensing materials.",

In Ethereum, gas (in Ether, a cryptographic currency like Bitcoin) is the execution fee compensating the computing resources of miners for running smart contracts. However, we find that under-optimized smart contracts cost more gas than necessary, and therefore the creators or users will be overcharged. In this work, we conduct the first investigation on Solidity, the recommended compiler, and reveal that it fails to optimize gas-costly programming patterns. In particular, we identify 7 gas-costly patterns and group them to 2 categories. Then, we propose and develop GASPER, a new tool for automatically locating gas-costly patterns by analyzing smart contractsu0027 bytecodes. The preliminary results on discovering 3 representative patterns from 4,240 real smart contracts show that 93.5%, 90.1% and 80% contracts suffer from these 3 patterns, respectively.",

Although several parallel approaches have been proposed to accelerate concolic execution, they neither scale well nor properly handle resource fluctuations and node failures, which often happen in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, named PACCI, which parallelizes concolic execution and adapts to the drastic changes of computing resources by leveraging cloud infrastructures. PACCI tailors concolic execution to the MapReduce programming model and takes into account the features of cloud infrastructures. In particular, we tackle several challenging issues, such as making the exploration of different program paths independently and constructing an extensible path exploration module to support the prioritization of test inputs from a global perspective. Preliminary experimental results show that PACCI is scalable (e.g., gaining about 20\u00d7 speedup using 24 nodes) and its efficiency declines slightly about 5% and 6.1% under resource fluctuations and node failures, respectively.",

Recently, application layer DDoS attacks against web servers are becoming popular, resulting in great revenue losses to victims. A systematic evaluation on the impacts of different DDoS attack methods is vital for the protection of web servers. In this paper, we examine the impacts of application layer DDoS attacks, including existing attacks against HTTP/1.1 and the new attacks proposed by us against HTTP/2.0. Moreover, to better understand attackersu0027 capabilities of launching severe application layer DDoS attacks, we design a new measurement method to remotely infer the performance of web servers and a method to differentiate dynamic and static URLs. We have collected and tailored 4 existing tools to launch 5 different DDoS attacks against HTTP/1.1 and developed a new DDoS tool to perform 5 different DDoS attacks against HTTP/2.0. By conducting extensive experiments in a testbed with two e-commercial websites running Apache and Nginx, we carefully evaluate the impacts of different DDoS attacks. The results show that the new remote measurement method is able to detect the effects caused by different DDoS attacks. Moreover, the attack impacts are affected by URLs, server architectures, and attack methods.",

        "abstract": "The gas mechanism in Ethereum charges the execution of every operation to ensure that smart contracts running in EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) will be eventually terminated. Failing to properly set the gas costs of EVM operations allows attackers to launch DoS attacks on Ethereum. Although Ethereum recently adjusted the gas costs of EVM operations to defend against known DoS attacks, it remains unknown whether the new setting is proper and how to configure it to defend against unknown DoS attacks. In this paper, we make the first step to address this challenging issue by first proposing an emulation-based framework to automatically measure the resource consumptions of EVM operations. The results reveal that Ethereum\u2019s new setting is still not proper. Moreover, we obtain an insight that there may always exist exploitable under-priced operations if the cost is fixed. Hence, we propose a novel gas cost mechanism, which dynamically adjusts the costs of EVM operations according to the number of executions, to thwart DoS attacks. This method punishes the operations that are executed much more frequently than before and lead to high gas costs. To make our solution flexible and secure and avoid frequent update of Ethereum client, we design a special smart contract that collaborates with the updated EVM for dynamic parameter adjustment. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively thwart both known and unknown DoS attacks with flexible parameter settings. Moreover, our method only introduces negligible additional gas consumption for benign users.",

However, a practical challenge, called path divergence, impairs\n         the soundness and completeness of concolic execution. A path divergence indicates\n         the tested program runs an unpredicted path. In this work, we carry out a comprehensive\n         empirical study on path divergences using an open\u2010source concolic execution tool,\n         named CREST. To make the investigation representative, we select 120 test units randomly\n         from 21 different open\u2010source programs. The results are interesting, and will provide\n         insight to solve the challenging path\u2010divergence problem. First, about one\u2010half of\n         test units suffer from path divergences, indicating path divergences are so prevalent\n         that the issue is worthy of great attention. Second, quite a number of generated test\n         inputs drive test units to take divergent paths. This means testers need considerable\n         effort to eliminate the misleading test inputs before aggregating them to a test suite.\n         Third, we dig out ten divergent patterns through manual analysis of each path divergence.\n         Among them, the three most prevalent ones, which are exceptions, external calls, and\n         type casts, lead to almost 82% of path divergences.

By exploiting the defects, we implement various proof-of-concept attacks that could drain battery without acquiring any permissions by subverting doze mode. The proposed attacks are silent (hardly discerned by normal users), because they keep hidden when the smartphone is in use, while letting benign applications do battery-intensive work when the smartphone is unused rather than consuming excessive power by the attacks themselves. Google has confirmed that our attacks can reduce battery life. Finally, we discuss how to defend against the proposed attacks.",

        "abstract": "A typical program analysis workflow heavily relies on Program Manipulation Software (PMS), incurring a high learning curve and changing to another PMS requires completely recoding. This work designs a middleware, that sits between the applications and the PMS, hides the differences of various PMS, and provides a unified programming interface. Based on the middleware, programmers can develop portable applications without learning the PMS, thereby reducing the learning and programming efforts. The current implementation of the middleware integrates Dyninst (static analysis) and Pin (dynamic analysis). Moreover, we develop five security applications, aiming to prevent systems from stack overflow, heap corruption, memory allocation/deallocation flaws, invocations of dangerous functions, and division-by-zero bugs. Experiments also show that the middleware incurs small space u0026 runtime overhead, and no false positives. Furthermore, the applications developed on the middleware require much less code, negligible runtime overhead, compared with the applications developed directly on Dyninst and Pin.",

        "abstract": "Firmware vulnerability is an important target for IoT attacks, but it is challenging, because firmware may be publicly unavailable or encrypted with an unknown key. We present in this paper an attack on Short Message Service (SMS for short) authentication code which aims at gaining the control of IoT devices without firmware analysis. The key idea is based on the observation that IoT device usually has an official application (app for short) used to control itself. Customer needs to register an account before using this app, phone numbers are usually suggested to be the account name, and most of these apps have a common feature, called Reset Your Password, that uses an SMS authentication code sent to customer phone to authenticate the customer when he forgot his password. We found that an attacker can perform brute-force attack on this SMS authentication code automatically by overcoming several challenges, then he can steal the account to gain the control of IoT devices. In our research, we have implemented a prototype tool, called SACIntruder, to enable performing such brute-force attack test on IoT devices automatically. We evaluated it and successfully found 12 zero-day vulnerabilities including smart lock, sharing car, smart watch, smart router, etc. We also discussed how to prevent this attack.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic binary analysis is difficult and burdensome. In practice, analysts always develop dynamic binary analyzers (DBAs) based on binary instrumentation tools (BITs), which are responsible for extracting information from a binary, monitoring or altering the execution of the binary. However, existing BITs either expose machine instructions to analysts or lack user-friendly APIs. Such problems result in a steep learning curve to grasp BITs and difficulties in eliminating bugs in DBAs. This work designs DBAF, a dynamic binary analysis framework that instruments binaries dynamically, conducts an online translation from machine code into an easy-to-handle intermediate representation (IR) and provides tens of APIs for IR processing. With DBAF, analysts can process binaries in the level of IR without the troubles to interpret machine instructions. Then, we develop five DBAs on top of DBAF, which are a division-by-zero protector, an IR counter, a memory tracer, a taint analyzer and a concolic executor. It demonstrates that DBAF can reduce the development effort for DBAs, especially the ones requiring semantic interpretation of instructions. Experiments show that DBAF brings about reasonable overhead in online translation.",

A heterogeneous edge-based compartmental approach is applied to analyze the social contagion on strongly heterogenous networks with skewed degree distribution, and the analytical results agree well with simulations. We find that either enlarging the contact capacity or decreasing adoption threshold makes the network more fragile to behavior spreading. Interestingly, we find that both the continuous and discontinuous dependence of the final adoption size on the effective information transmission probability can arise. There is a crossover phenomenon between the two types of dependence. More specifically, the crossover phenomenon can be induced by changing any one of certain parameters, i.e., the average degree, the fraction of initial seeds and adoption threshold.",

        "abstract": "Graph similarity search is among the most important graph-based applications, e.g. finding the chemical compounds that are most similar to a query compound. Graph similarity/distance computation, such as Graph Edit Distance (GED) and Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS), is the core operation of graph similarity search and many other applications, but very costly to compute in practice. Inspired by the recent success of neural network approaches to several graph applications, such as node or graph classification, we propose a novel neural network based approach to address this classic yet challenging graph problem, aiming to alleviate the computational burden while preserving a good performance. The proposed approach, called SimGNN, combines two strategies. First, we design a learnable embedding function that maps every graph into an embedding vector, which provides a global summary of a graph. A novel attention mechanism is proposed to emphasize the important nodes with respect to a specific similarity metric. Second, we design a pairwise node comparison method to supplement the graph-level embeddings with fine-grained node-level information. Our model achieves better generalization on unseen graphs, and in the worst case runs in quadratic time with respect to the number of nodes in two graphs. Taking GED computation as an example, experimental results on three real graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. Specifically, our model achieves smaller error rate and great time reduction compared against a series of baselines, including several approximation algorithms on GED computation, and many existing graph neural network based models. Our study suggests SimGNN provides a new direction for future research on graph similarity computation and graph similarity search.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Anomaly detection plays an important role in modern data-driven security applications, such as detecting suspicious access to a socket from a process. In many cases, such events can be described as a collection of categorical values that are considered as entities of different types, which we call heterogeneous categorical events. Due to the lack of intrinsic distance measures among entities, and the exponentially large event space, most existing work relies heavily on heuristics to calculate abnormal scores for events. Different from previous work, we propose a principled and unified probabilistic model APE (Anomaly detection via Probabilistic pairwise interaction and Entity embedding) that directly models the likelihood of events. In this model, we embed entities into a common latent space using their observed co-occurrence in different events. More specifically, we first model the compatibility of each pair of entities according to their embeddings. Then we utilize the weighted pairwise interactions of different entity types to define the event probability. Using Noise-Contrastive Estimation with \\\"context-dependent\\\" noise distribution, our model can be learned efficiently regardless of the large event space. Experimental results on real enterprise surveillance data show that our methods can accurately detect abnormal events compared to other state-of-the-art abnormal detection techniques.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of author identification under double-blind review setting, which is to identify potential authors given information of an anonymized paper. Different from existing approaches that rely heavily on feature engineering, we propose to use network embedding approach to address the problem, which can automatically represent nodes into lower dimensional feature vectors. However, there are two major limitations in recent studies on network embedding: (1) they are usually general-purpose embedding methods, which are independent of the specific tasks; and (2) most of these approaches can only deal with homogeneous networks, where the heterogeneity of the network is ignored. Hence, challenges faced here are two folds: (1) how to embed the network under the guidance of the author identification task, and (2) how to select the best type of information due to the heterogeneity of the network. To address the challenges, we propose a task-guided and path-augmented heterogeneous network embedding model. In our model, nodes are first embedded as vectors in latent feature space. Embeddings are then shared and jointly trained according to task-specific and network-general objectives. We extend the existing unsupervised network embedding to incorporate meta paths in heterogeneous networks, and select paths according to the specific task. The guidance from author identification task for network embedding is provided both explicitly in joint training and implicitly during meta path selection. Our experiments demonstrate that by using path-augmented network embedding with task guidance, our model can obtain significantly better accuracy at identifying the true authors comparing to existing methods.",

        "abstract": "The problem of ideology detection is to study the latent (political) placement for people, which is traditionally studied on politicians according to their voting behaviors. Recently, more and more studies begin to address the ideology detection problem for ordinary users based on their online behaviors that can be captured by social media, e.g., Twitter. As far as we are concerned, however, the vast majority of the existing methods on ideology detection on social media have oversimplified the problem as a binary classification problem (i.e., liberal vs. conservative). Moreover, though social links can play a critical role in deciding oneu0027s ideology, most of the existing work ignores the heterogeneous types of links in social media. In this paper we propose to detect emph{numerical} ideology positions for Twitter users, according to their emph{follow}, emph{mention}, and emph{retweet} links to a selected set of politicians. A unified probabilistic model is proposed that can (1) explain the reasons why links are built among people in terms of their ideology, (2) integrate heterogeneous types of links together in determining peopleu0027s ideology, and (3) automatically learn the quality of each type of links in deciding oneu0027s ideology. Experiments have demonstrated the advantages of our model in terms of both ranking and political leaning classification accuracy. It is shown that (1) using multiple types of links is better than using any single type of links alone to determine oneu0027s ideology, and (2) our model is even more superior than baselines when dealing with people that are sparsely linked in one type of links. We also show that the detected ideology for Twitter users aligns with our intuition quite well.",

        "abstract": "Learning a good representation of text is key to many recommendation applications. Examples include news recommendation where texts to be recommended are constantly published everyday. However, most existing recommendation techniques, such as matrix factorization based methods, mainly rely on interaction histories to learn representations of items. While latent factors of items can be learned effectively from user interaction data, in many cases, such data is not available, especially for newly emerged items. In this work, we aim to address the problem of personalized recommendation for completely new items with text information available. We cast the problem as a personalized text ranking problem and propose a general framework that combines text embedding with personalized recommendation. Users and textual content are embedded into latent feature space. The text embedding function can be learned end-to-end by predicting user interactions with items. To alleviate sparsity in interaction data, and leverage large amount of text data with little or no user interactions, we further propose a joint text embedding model that incorporates unsupervised text embedding with a combination module. Experimental results show that our model can significantly improve the effectiveness of recommendation systems on real-world datasets.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in neural networks have inspired people to design hybrid recommendation algorithms that can incorporate both (1) user-item interaction information and (2) content information including image, audio, and text. Despite their promising results, neural network-based recommendation algorithms pose extensive computational costs, making it challenging to scale and improve upon. In this paper, we propose a general neural network-based recommendation framework, which subsumes several existing state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms, and address the efficiency issue by investigating sampling strategies in the stochastic gradient descent training for the framework. We tackle this issue by first establishing a connection between the loss functions and the user-item interaction bipartite graph, where the loss function terms are defined on links while major computation burdens are located at nodes. We call this type of loss functions \\\"graph-based\\\" loss functions, for which varied mini-batch sampling strategies can have different computational costs. Based on the insight, three novel sampling strategies are proposed, which can significantly improve the training efficiency of the proposed framework (up to $\\\\times 30$ times speedup in our experiments), as well as improving the recommendation performance. Theoretical analysis is also provided for both the computational cost and the convergence. We believe the study of sampling strategies have further implications on general graph-based loss functions, and would also enable more research under the neural network-based recommendation framework.",

        "abstract": "Embedding methods such as word embedding have become pillars for many applications containing discrete structures. Conventional embedding methods directly associate each symbol with a continuous embedding vector, which is equivalent to applying linear transformation based on one-hot encoding of the discrete symbols. Despite its simplicity, such approach yields number of parameters that grows linearly with the vocabulary size and can lead to overfitting. In this work we propose a much more compact K-way D-dimensional discrete encoding scheme to replace the one-hot encoding. In KD encoding, each symbol is represented by a $D$-dimensional code, and each of its dimension has a cardinality of $K$. The final symbol embedding vector can be generated by composing the code embedding vectors. To learn the semantically meaningful code, we derive a relaxed discrete optimization technique based on stochastic gradient descent. By adopting the new coding system, the efficiency of parameterization can be significantly improved (from linear to logarithmic), and this can also mitigate the over-fitting problem. In our experiments with language modeling, the number of embedding parameters can be reduced by 97% while achieving similar or better performance.",

        "abstract": "With the recent availability of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and great opportunities they offer for advancing medical informatics, there has been growing interest in mining EHR for improving quality of care. Disease diagnosis due to its sensitive nature, huge costs of error, and complexity has become an increasingly important focus of research in past years. Existing studies model EHR by capturing co-occurrence of clinical events to learn their latent embeddings. However, relations among clinical events carry various semantics and contribute differently to disease diagnosis which gives precedence to a more advanced modeling of heterogeneous data types and relations in EHR data than existing solutions. To address these issues, we represent how high-dimensional EHR data and its rich relationships can be suitably translated into HeteroMed, a heterogeneous information network for robust medical diagnosis. Our modeling approach allows for straightforward handling of missing values and heterogeneity of data. HeteroMed exploits metapaths to capture higher level and semantically important relations contributing to disease diagnosis. Furthermore, it employs a joint embedding framework to tailor clinical event representations to the disease diagnosis goal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use Heterogeneous Information Network for modeling clinical data and disease diagnosis. Experimental results of our study show superior performance of HeteroMed compared to prior methods in prediction of exact diagnosis codes and general disease cohorts. Moreover, HeteroMed outperforms baseline models in capturing similarities of clinical events which are examined qualitatively through case studies.\n\n",

        "abstract": "The equation of state of aragonite was determined by in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments on a hot-pressed polycrystalline specimen of aragonite within its stability field up to 5.8 GPa and 1173 K. As a complement to this experimental study, first-principle density functional theory calculations were performed up to 20 GPa at 0 K. Thermoelastic parameters for aragonite (CaCO 3 ) were derived by a least-squares fit of the experimental  P-V-T  data to the third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state (EOS), yielding the bulk modulus and its pressure and temperature derivatives  K  0  = 65.24 \u00b1 0.24 GPa,  K \u2032 0  = 4.95 \u00b1 0.12, (\u2202 K  T /\u2202 T )  P   = \u22120.024 \u00b1 0.002 GPa/K and volume thermal expansion \u03b1 300  = (6.1 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 10 \u22125  K \u22121 . The analyses of the axial compressibility at ambient temperature show that the  c -axis is much more compressible than the  a - and  b- axes. Based on first-principle calculations, the anisotropic compression behavior of aragonite structure is explained by the heterogeneous shortening of   and   bond lengths and the rotation of   angles along the  a -,  b -, and  c -axes, whereas the unit-cell volume change of aragonite under compression is accommodated by comparable compression rate of the CaO 9  polyhedra and the voids in the crystal lattice. The results attained from this study provide important thermoelastic parameters for understanding the thermodynamic behavior and chemical reactions involving aragonite at subduction zone conditions.",

        "abstract": "The crystal structure and equation of state of coesite (space group  C 2 /c ) and its high-pressure polymorph coesite-II (space group  P 2 1  /n ) under pressure have been studied using X-ray powder diffraction in a diamond-anvil cell (DAC) up to 31 GPa at room-temperature and first-principles calculations at 0 K up to 45 GPa. New diffraction peaks appear above 20 GPa, indicating the formation of coesite-II structure. The calculated enthalpies provide theoretical support for the pressure-induced phase transformation from coesite to coesite-II at ~21.4 GPa. Compared with coesite, the coesite-II structure is characterized by a \u201cdoubled\u201d  b -axis and the breakdown of the linear Si1-O1-Si1 angle in coesite into two distinct angles\u2014one is ~176\u00b0, close to linear, whereas the other decreases by 22 to 158\u00b0. Coesite is very anisotropic with the  a -axis the shortest and twice more compressible than the  b-  and  c -axis. By comparison, coesite-II is not so anisotropic with similar compressibilities in its  a -,  b -, and  c -axis. As analyzed by a third-order Eulerian finite strain equation of state, the bulk modulus of coesite at 21.4 GPa is 182.3 GPa, and that of coesite-II is 140.8 GPa, indicating that coesite-II is much more compressible than coesite. The existence of coesite-II in the coldest subduction zone will change the elasticity and anisotropic properties of the subducting materials dramatically.",

Using finite strain equation of state approaches, the elastic bulk and shear moduli and their pressure dependences are derived yielding KS0=325.9\u00b14.8\u2009 GPa, \u2009G0=164.1\u00b12.5\u2009 GPa, KS0\u2032=3.65\u00b10.05, and G0\u2032=1.28\u00b10.02. On the basis of the current experimental data, the high-pressure behavior of Youngu0027s modulus, Poissonu0027s ratio, and ductility/brittleness for tungsten are also investigated. Complementary to the experimental data, the single crystal elastic constants, as well as the elastic anisotropy of tungsten are computed using density functional theory (DFT). The Voigt-Reuss-Hill average of the bulk and shear moduli calculated using the single crystal elastic constants from DFT are found comparable to the current experimental results within about 5%.

        "abstract": "The compressional and shear wave velocities for coesite have been measured simultaneously up to 5.8 GPa and 1073 K by ultrasonic interferometry for the first time. The shear wave velocity decreases with pressure along all isotherms. The resulting contrasts between coesite and stishovite reach ~34% and ~45% for P and S wave velocities, respectively, and ~64% and ~75% for their impedance at mantle conditions. The large velocity and impedance contrasts across coesite-stishovite transition imply that, to generate the velocity and impedance contrasts observed at the X-discontinuity, only a small amount of silica would be required. The velocity jump dependences on silica, d(lnVP)/d(SiO2) = 0.38 (wt%)-1 and d(lnVS)/d(SiO2) = 0.52 (wt%)-1, are utilized to place constraints on the amount of silica in the upper mantle, and provide a geophysical approach to track mantle eclogite materials and ancient subducted oceanic slabs.",

Complementary to the experimental data, the single crystal elastic constants, the elastic anisotropy, and the unit cell axial ratio c/a of \u03b1-hafnium at high pressures were investigated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) based first principles calculations. A c/a value of 1.605 is predicted for \u03b1-Hf at 40\u2009GPa, which is in excellent agreement with previous experimental results. The low-pressure derivative of the shear modulus observed in our experimental data up to 10\u2009GPa was found to originate from the elastic constant C44, which exhibits negligible pressure dependence within the current experimental pressure range.

        "abstract": "The elastic properties of praseodymium (Pr) were investigated at pressure up to 12\u2009GPa at room temperature using the ultrasonic interferometry technique. Softening and discontinuities in compressional (P) and shear (S) wave velocities were observed at around 2.5, 6.5, and 10.5\u2009GPa, which are interpreted as indications of the phase transitions from Pr-I (dhcp) to Pr-II (fcc), Pr-II (fcc) to Pr-III (d-fcc), and Pr-III (d-fcc) to Pr-VII (monoclinic or orthorhombic), respectively. Discontinuities in compressibility have been observed across the phase transitions of I-II and II-III of Pr by an analysis of pressure derivatives of the elastic moduli. A comparison with the elastic behaviors of other lanthanide elements (e.g., Ce and La) suggests that the elastic anomalies associated with these phase transitions are likely to be caused by the 6s-5d electron transfer and the softening of acoustic phonon mode facilitated by decreased atomic distances under pressure.",

        "title": "Sound velocities of the 23 \u00c5 phase at high pressure and implications for seismic velocities in subducted slabs",
        "abstract": "Abstract   Dense hydrous magnesium silicates (DHMS) are believed to play an important role in transporting water back into the deep interior of the Earth. Recently, a new Al-bearing hydrous Mg-silicate, named the 23\u202fA phase [ideal composition Mg 12 Al 2 Si 4 O 16 (OH) 14 ], was reported (Cai et al., 2015), which could be another important hydrous phase in subducting slabs. In this paper, we report new measurements of the compressional (P) and shear (S) wave velocities of the 23\u202fA phase under pressures up to 14\u202fGPa at room temperature, using a bulk sample with a grain size of less than 20\u202f\u03bcm and density of 2.947\u202fg/cm 3 . The acoustic measurements were conducted in a 1000-ton uniaxial split-cylinder multi-anvil apparatus using ultrasonic interferometric techniques (Li et al., 1996). The pressures were determined in situ by using an alumina buffer rod as the pressure marker (Wang et al., 2015). A dual-mode piezoelectric transducer enabled us to measure P and S wave travel times simultaneously, which in turn allowed a precise determination of the sound velocities and elastic bulk ( K S  ) and shear ( G ) moduli at high pressures. The velocities of this 23\u202fA phase (ambient  V P  \u202f=\u202f7.53\u202fkm/s,  V S  \u202f=\u202f3.72\u202fkm/s) are lower than those of phase A, olivine, pyrope, etc. (especially for S waves), yet the  V P  / V S   ratio (from 2.02 to 1.94, decreasing with increasing pressure) is much higher compared to those mantle minerals (1.7\u20131.8). A fit to the acoustic data using finite strain analysis combined with the Hashin-Shtrikman (HS) averaging scheme yields:  K S   0 \u202f=\u202f111.4(6)\u202fGPa,  G  0 \u202f=\u202f41.0(2)\u202fGPa, and  K S  \u2032\u202f=\u202f3.6,  G \u2032\u202f=\u202f1.8 for the bulk and shear moduli and their pressure derivatives. Using these data, the density and velocity profiles of the hydrous harzburgite and lherzolite were calculated along a warm slab P-T condition. The results suggest that a hydrous pyrolitic assemblage containing 23\u202fA phase should be distinguishable from a dry assemblage at the high pressure and temperature conditions relevant to Al-bearing subducted slabs .",

Analysis of the P and S wave velocities yielded K0\u2009=\u2009123(1)\u2009GPa, K0\u2032\u2009=\u20095.1(2), G0\u2009=\u200975(1)\u2009GPa, and G0\u2032=\u20091.3(1) for the bulk and shear moduli and their pressure derivatives. Comparison with Voigt-Reuss-Hill (VRH) calculations based on literature elasticity data for its constituent minerals indicates that the experimentally measured P and S wave velocities, densities, bulk sound velocities, and VP/VS ratios fall close to the lower limit of VRH averages associated with the uncertainties of the mineral elasticity data. A comparison with previous modeling of mantle compositions implies that the velocities for an aggregate with the pyrolitic composition of KLB-1 are in close agreement with seismic data at the depths of the Earthu0027s upper mantle.",

Glucose uptake is the key step for fat synthesis in adipocyte. miRNAs have been proven to play a crucial role in adipocyte differentiation, adipogenesis and glucose homeostasis. In this paper, we firstly reported that miR-146b decreased glucose consumption by up-regulating miR-146b in a porcine primary adipocyte model, while the inhibitor of endogenous miR-146b rescued the reduction. Then, miR-146b was predicated to target  by bioinformatics analysis, and a dual-luciferase reporter assay validated this predication. Western blot analyses indicated both  and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) were down-regulated by miR-146b overexpression. Our study demonstrated that miR-146b regulated glucose homeostasis in porcine primary pre-adipocyte by targeting , and provided new understandings on regulations of lipogenesis by miRNAs.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that bovine milk contains mRNA and microRNA that are largely encapsulated in milk-derived exosomes. However, little information is available about long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) in bovine milk. Increasing evidence suggests that lncRNA are of particular interest given their key role in gene expression and development. We performed a comprehensive analysis of lncRNA in bovine milk exosomes by RNA sequencing. We used a validated human in vitro digestion model to investigate the stability of lncRNA encapsulated in bovine milk exosomes during the digestion process. We identified 3,475 novel lncRNA and 6 annotated lncRNA. The lncRNA shared characteristics with those of other mammals in terms of length, exon number, and open reading frames. However, lncRNA showed higher expression than mRNAs. We selected 12 lncRNA of high-expression abundance and identified them by PCR. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses showed that lncRNA regulate immune function, osteoblastogenesis, neurodevelopment, reproduction, cell proliferation, and cell-cell communication. We also investigated the 12 lncRNA using quantitative real-time PCR to reveal their expression profiles in milk exosomes during different stages of lactation (colostrum 2 d, 30 d, 150 d, and 270 d); their resulting expression levels in milk exosomes showed variations across the stages. A digestion experiment showed that bovine milk exosome lncRNA was resistant to in vitro digestion with different digestive juices, including saliva, gastric juice, pancreatic juice, and bile juice. Taken together, these results show for the first time that cow milk contains lncRNA, and that their abundance varied at different stages of lactation. As expected, bovine milk exosomal lncRNA were stable during in vitro digestion. These findings provide a basis for further understanding of the physiological role of milk lncRNA.",

Recent studies have shown that miRNAs might regulate gene expression among different species in a cross-kingdom manner. However, the specific roles of plant miRNAs in animals remains poorly understood and somewhat. Herein, we found that plant MIR156 regulates proliferation of intestine cells both  and . Continuous administration of a high plant miRNA diet or synthetic MIR156 elevated MIR156 levels and inhibited the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway in mouse intestine. Bioinformatics predictions and luciferase reporter assays indicated that MIR156 targets Wnt10b. , MIR156 suppressed proliferation by downregulating the Wnt10b protein and upregulating \u03b2-catenin phosphorylation in porcine jejunum epithelial (IPEC-J2) cell line. LiCl and an MIR156 inhibitor relieved this inhibition. This research is the first to demonstrate that plant MIR156 inhibits intestine cell proliferation by targeting Wnt10b. More importantly, plant miRNAs may represent a new class of bioactive molecules that act as epigenetic regulators in humans and other animals.",

Evidence emerging in recent years suggests that microRNAs in food can be absorbed into the circulatory system and organs of humans and other animals, where they regulate gene expression and biological processes. These food-derived dietary microRNAs may serve as a novel functional component of food, a role that has been neglected to date. However, a significant amount of evidence challenges this new concept. The absorption, stability, and physiological effects of dietary microRNA in recipients, especially in mammals, are currently under heavy debate. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the unique characteristics of dietary microRNAs and concerns about both the mechanistic and methodological basis for studying the biological significance of dietary microRNAs. Such efforts will benefit continuing investigations and offer new perspectives for the interpretation of the roles of dietary microRNA with respect to the health and disease of humans and animals.",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) could also participate in diverse biological processes. However, the role of miRNAs in the decline of pituitary GH during the growth process remains unclear. To better characterize the effects of miRNAs on the pituitary, we used a miRNA microarray to investigate the miRNA profile in the rat pituitary from postnatal development throughout the growth process. Then, in vitro experiments were conducted to analyze the miRNAs' potential roles related to GH regulation. Taken together, the microarray results indicated that there were 22 miRNAs differentially expressed during pituitary development. The bioinformatics analysis suggested that the most differentially expressed miRNAs may participate in multiple pathways associated with the pituitary function. Furthermore, the in vitro findings demonstrated that miR-141-3p was involved in GH regulation.",

In addition, exosomal transcriptome analysis identified 14,696 protein-coding genes in sow's milk exosomes, and 283 genes with 204 and 79 candidates showing up and down-regulation were significantly responded to GPS supplementation. Integrated analysis of each differently expressed miRNA with significantly expressed genes further revealed the presence of 51 highly conserved miRNA-gene interactions that were annotated to be related to immunoregulatory functions.

        "abstract": "Abstract FSH plays an essential role in processes involved in human reproduction, including spermatogenesis and the ovarian cycle. While the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying its synthesis and secretion have been extensively studied, little is known about its posttranscriptional regulation. A bioinformatics analysis from our group indicated that a microRNA (miRNA; miR-361-3p) could regulate FSH secretion by potentially targeting the FSHB subunit. Herein, we sought to confirm these findings by investigating the miR-361-3p-mediated regulation of FSH production in primary pig anterior pituitary cells. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) treatment resulted in an increase in FSHB synthesis at both the mRNA, protein/hormone level, along with a significant decrease in miR-361-3p and its precursor (pre-miR-361) levels in time- and dose-dependent manner. Using the Dual-Luciferase Assay, we confirmed that miR-361-3p directly targets FSHB. Additionally, overexpression of miR-361-3p using mimics significantly decreased the FSHB production at both the mRNA and protein levels, with a reduction in both protein synthesis and secretion. Conversely, both synthesis and secretion were significantly increased following miR-361-3p blockade. To confirm that miR-361-3p targets FSHB, we designed FSH-targeted siRNAs, and co-transfected anterior pituitary cells with both the siRNA and miR-361-3p inhibitors. Our results indicated that the siRNA blocked the miR-361-3p inhibitor-mediated upregulation of FSH, while no significant effect on non-target expression. Taken together, our results demonstrate that miR-361-3p negatively regulates FSH synthesis and secretion by targeting FSHB, which provides more functional evidence that a miRNA is involved in the direct regulation of FSH.",

        "abstract": "Ginseng and its polysaccharides (GPS) have been well known as an immune modulator. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary supplemental GPS on the immune responses involved in sow9s milk-derived exosomal shuttle RNAs (esRNAs) using RNA-Seq and miRNA-Seq. Of the 213 identified miRNA types, a total of 26 conserved miRNAs were differently expressed in response to GPS supplementation, including 10 up-regulated and 16 down-regulated miRNAs in GPS feeding group. In addition, exosomal transcriptome analysis identified 14,696 protein-coding genes in sow9s milk exosomes, and 283 genes with 204 and 79 candidates showing up and down-regulation were significantly responded to GPS supplementation. Integrated analysis of each differently expressed miRNA with significantly expressed genes further revealed the presence of 51 highly conserved miRNA-gene interactions that were annotated to be related to immunoregulatory functions. This work provided an important advance in the functional identification of dietary GPS supplementation and more fundamental information about how GPS promoted the immune response and healthy growth of the infant from mothers at molecular levels.",

Structurally, they have a crowded molecular scaffold decorated with more than 11 stereogenic centers. Here we report divergent syntheses of eight dimeric lindenane sesquiterpenoids, shizukaols A, C, D, I, chlorajaponilide C, multistalide B, sarcandrolide J and sarglabolide I. In particular, we present a unified dimerization strategy utilizing a base-mediated thermal [4\u2009+\u20092] cycloaddition between a common furyl diene, generated in situ, and various types of dienophiles. Accordingly, all the three types of lindenane [4\u2009+\u20092] dimers with versatile biological activities are accessible, which would stimulate future probing of their pharmaceutical potential.",

        "abstract": "The dimeric lindenane sesquiterpenoids are mainly isolated from the plants of Chloranthaceae family. Structurally, they have a crowded molecular scaffold decorated with more than 11 stereogenic centers. Here we report divergent syntheses of eight dimeric lindenane sesquiterpenoids, shizukaols A, C, D, I, chlorajaponilide C, multistalide B, sarcandrolide J and sarglabolide I. In particular, we present a unified dimerization strategy utilizing a base-mediated thermal [4\u2009+\u20092] cycloaddition between a common furyl diene, generated in situ, and various types of dienophiles. Accordingly, all the three types of lindenane [4\u2009+\u20092] dimers with versatile biological activities are accessible, which would stimulate future probing of their pharmaceutical potential.",

        "abstract": "Most genetically modified crops are engineered for herbicide tolerance, among them, glyphosate tolerant crops have the greatest share. Glyphosate is one of the most extensively used herbicides worldwide. The popularity of glyphosate stems from its low cost, low environmental impact, and effectiveness while being safe for animals. The toxicity of glyphosate to untargeted organisms was studied using goldfish () after exposure to different concentrations of glyphosate isopropylamine salt, a glyphosate based herbicide for 96 hours. Tissues of brain, kidney and liver were collected and subjected to NMR-based metabolomics analysis and histopathological inspection. Plasma was collected and the hematological parameters of glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (CRE) were quantified. Glyphosate produced an increase in the hematological parameters of BUN and CRE and dose-dependent injuries. Metabolomics analysis revealed significant perturbations in neurotransmitter equilibrium, energy metabolism and amino acid metabolism in glyphosate dosed fish, which are associated with the toxicity of glyphosate. The results highlight the vulnerability of glutaminergic neurons to glyphosate and enlighten the potential of glutamine as an early marker of glyphosate induced neurotoxicity.",

        "abstract": "Environmental context Heavy metals are non-degradable and are therefore a severe and persistent environmental menace. The toxic effects of Pb were investigated using NMR to determine the metabolic changes in earthworms exposed to Pb. The approach using 1H NMR to analyse earthworm metabolomics demonstrated great potential as a reliable, rapid and convenient tool to assess the toxicity of heavy metals and could be used to identify warning signs of heavy metal contamination of soil. Abstract A 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based approach to metabolomics combined with atomic absorption spectroscopy, histopathological examination and biochemical assessment was used to determine the toxic effects of lead (Pb) on earthworms (Eisenia fetida). Earthworms were exposed to Pb in a lead nitrate solution at converted concentrations of 1.25, 5.0 and 20\u00b5gcm\u20132 in contact tests for 48h. Based on histopathological inspection, the epidermis, muscles, chloragogenous tissues and intestinal epithelium were severely impaired. Based on biochemical assessment, a disruption of the antioxidative system and neurotoxic effects in earthworms occurred following exposure to Pb. Orthogonal signal correction\u2013partial least-squares-discriminant analysis of NMR profiles indicated that Pb exposure in earthworms caused widespread metabolic changes, which were associated with oxidative stress, neurotransmitter imbalance, disruption of osmotic equilibrium and interference in energy metabolism and nucleic acid metabolism. The integrated metabolomics approach provided new insights into Pb-induced toxicity in earthworms. Metabolomics is a powerful and highly effective approach and has great promise to determine the ecotoxicological effects and the underlying mechanisms of toxicity of heavy metals.",

        "abstract": "Most genetically modified crops are engineered for herbicide tolerance, among them, glyphosate tolerant crops have the greatest share. Glyphosate is one of the most extensively used herbicides worldwide. The popularity of glyphosate stems from its low cost, low environmental impact, and effectiveness while being safe for animals. The toxicity of glyphosate to untargeted organisms was studied using goldfish (Carassius auratus) after exposure to different concentrations of glyphosate isopropylamine salt, a glyphosate based herbicide for 96 hours. Tissues of brain, kidney and liver were collected and subjected to NMR-based metabolomics analysis and histopathological inspection. Plasma was collected and the hematological parameters of glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (CRE) were quantified. Glyphosate produced an increase in the hematological parameters of BUN and CRE and dose-dependent injuries. Metabolomics analysis revealed significant perturbations in neurotransmitter equilibrium, energy metabolism and amino acid metabolism in glyphosate dosed fish, which are associated with the toxicity of glyphosate. The results highlight the vulnerability of glutaminergic neurons to glyphosate and enlighten the potential of glutamine as an early marker of glyphosate induced neurotoxicity.",

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) promotes lung cancer malignant progression. Here, we take advantage of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-mediated somatic gene knockout in a  mouse model to identify bona fide TSGs. From individual knockout of 55 potential TSGs, we identify five genes, including , , , , and , whose knockout significantly promotes lung tumorigenesis. These candidate genes are frequently down-regulated in human lung cancer specimens and significantly associated with survival in patients with lung cancer. Through crossing the conditional  knockout allele to the  mouse model, we further find that  deletion dramatically promotes lung cancer progression. The tumor-promotive effect of  knockout in vivo is mainly mediated through an increase of the EZH2 level, which up-regulates the H3K27me3 level. Moreover, the -knockout lung tumors are preferentially sensitive to EZH2 inhibitor treatment. Collectively, our study provides a systematic screening of TSGs in vivo and identifies UTX as an important epigenetic regulator in lung tumorigenesis.",

Mutations in the dysferlin gene (DYSF) lead to multiple clinical phenotypes, including Miyoshi myopathy (MM), limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD 2B), and distal myopathy with anterior tibial onset (DMAT). Patients with dysferlinopathy also show muscle inflammation, which often leads to a misdiagnosis as inflammatory myopathy. In this study, we examined and analyzed the dyferlinopathy-associated immunological features. Methods: Comparative immunohistochemical analysis of inflammatory cell infiltration, and muscle expression of MHC-I and C5b-9 was performed using muscle biopsy samples from 14 patients with dysferlinopathy, 7 patients with polymyositis, and 8 patients with either Duchenne muscular dystrophy or Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD). Results: Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positive staining for immune response-related CD4+ cells, macrophages, MHC-I and C5b-9 in dysferlinopathy, which is in a different mode of polymyositis and DMD/BMD. Conclusion: These results demonstrated the involvement of immune factors in the pathogenesis of dysferlinopathy.",

Particularly, ultrasound scattering attenuation can infer the margin properties of breast tumors. Ultrasound attenuation tomography quantitatively reconstructs the attenuation properties of the breast. Our synthetic-aperture breast ultrasound tomography system with two parallel transducer arrays records both ultrasound reflection and transmission signals. We develop an ultrasound attenuation tomography method using ultrasound energy-scaled amplitude decays of ultrasound transmission signals and conduct ultrasound attenuation tomography using a known sound-speed model. We apply our ultrasound transmission attenuation tomography method to a breast phantom dataset, and compare the ultrasound attenuation tomography results with conventional beamforming ultrasound images obtained using reflection signals. We show that ultrasound transmission attenuation tomography complements beamforming images in identifying breast lesions.",

We recently designed and manufactured a new synthetic-aperture breast ultrasound tomography prototype with two parallel transducer arrays consisting of a total of 768 transducer elements. The transducer arrays are translated vertically to scan the breast in a warm water tank from the chest wall/axillary region to the nipple region to acquire ultrasound transmission and reflection data for whole-breast ultrasound tomography imaging. The distance of these two ultrasound transducer arrays is adjustable for scanning breasts with different sizes. We use our breast ultrasound tomography prototype to acquire phantom and in vivo patient ultrasound data to study its feasibility for breast imaging. We apply our recently developed ultrasound imaging and tomography algorithms to ultrasound data acquired using our breast ultrasound tomography system. Our in vivo patient imaging results demonstrate that our breast ultrasound tomography can detect breast lesions shown on clinical ultrasound and mammographic images.",

In this work, two BiOI nanosheets with different dominant facets were synthesized using either molecular precursor hydrolysis or calcination. Crystal structure characterizations, included X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), field emission electron microscopy and fast Fourier transformation (FFT) images, showed that hydrolysis and calcination resulted in the dominant exposure of {100} and {001} facets, respectively. Photocatalytic data revealed that BiOI-001 had a higher activity than BiOI-100 for N fixation and dye degradation. Photoelectrochemical data revealed that BiOI-001 had higher photoinduced carrier separation efficiency than BiOI-100. The band structure analysis also used to explain the underlying photocatalytic mechanism based on the different conduction band position. This work presents the first report about the facet-dependent photocatalytic performance of bismuth-rich Bi-O-X photocatalysts.",

In this study, the size-dependent role of gold (Au) in Au/g-C 3 N 4 /BiOBr system was studied for photocatalytic CO 2  reduction and dye degradation. The results revealed that big Au nanoparticles mainly displayed Z-scheme bridge role, and g-C 3 N 4 /BiOBr/Au-B showed higher photocatalytic activity than g-C 3 N 4 /BiOBr under 380\u00a0nm monochromatic light irradiation. Small Au nanoparticles mainly displayed SPR role, and g-C 3 N 4 /BiOBr/Au-S showed higher photocatalytic activity than g-C 3 N 4 /BiOBr under 550\u00a0nm monochromatic light irradiation. The size-dependent role of Au nanoparticles for photocatalytic system should be due to the SPR effect of small Au nanoparticles and electron transfer center of big Au nanoparticles. This finding can guide us to prepare high photocatalytic activity noble metal loaded photocatalysts.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Bismuth oxyhalides (BiOX, X\u00a0=\u00a0Br, I) photocatalysts are rarely applied for photocatalytic reduction reaction withthe photo-induced electron, as this is impeded by their low conduction band. As a widely used approach for enhancing the photocatalytic reduction activity, bismuth-rich strategy results the bismuth content of BiOX photocatalysts increasing. In this paper, a solid solutions of bismuth-rich Bi 4 O 5 Br x I 2-x  were prepared applying the molecular precursor method. Bi 4 O 5 Br x I 2-x  were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), element mapping, Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller surface analysis (BET), UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The obtained photocatalytic data showed that Bi 4 O 5 Br x I 2-x  solid solutions had higher photocatalytic activities than Bi 4 O 5 Br 2  and Bi 4 O 5 I 2 . At an optimal ratio of x\u00a0=\u00a01, the Bi 4 O 5 BrI photocatalyst showed the highest photocatalytic reduction activity for CO 2  conversion (22.85\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0h \u22121 \u00a0g \u22121  CO generation, AQE was 0.372 at 400\u00a0nm) and Cr(VI) removal (88%). CO 2  adsorption data and CO 2  temperature programmed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) revealed that Bi 4 O 5 BrI exhibited the highest chemical adsorption ability of CO 2  molecules Photocurrent and electrochemical impedance (EIS) spectroscopy demonstrated the enhanced photo-induced carrier separation efficiency of Bi 4 O 5 BrI. These mechanistic studies suggest that Bi 4 O 5 Br x I 2-x  solid solutions are excellent photocatalysts for solar fuel generation and environmental remediation.",

Then, anaerobic digestion experiments were conducted within 32 days at moderate temperature (35\u00a0\u00b0C) with TS mass fraction (6%), inoculation rate (20%) and initial pH (7.0). It is indicated that compared with the control group, 9 groups of hybrid Pennisetum pretreated by HPEF are obviously superior in gas production efficiency of anaerobic fermentation, and higher in cumulative gas production, peak daily gas production and maximum methane concentration; that the most remarkable stimulation occurs in the HPEF condition of 15\u00a0kV/120\u00a0Hz/60 min, in that situation, the cumulative gas production in the fermentation period of 32 days is up to 9587\u00a0mL, 26.95% higher than that of the control group, the peak daily gas production increases and the range of peak period extends. It is demonstrated that the optimal HPEF pretreatment time is 60\u00a0min and three HPEF parameters have a better effect on gas production in the order of voltage\u00a0u003e\u00a0time\u00a0u003e\u00a0frequency; and that the effect degree of treatment parameters on peak daily gas production is voltage, frequency and time in turn. It is concluded that HPEF can improve material utilization ratio and gas production rate of hybrid Pennisetum by anaerobic fermentation and shorten the gas production cycle. By virtue of this physical pretreatment method, the resource of Pennisetum is utilized sufficiently and the classes of energy plants are enlarged effectively.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Based on the fact that recycling of combined filter backwash water (CFBW) directly to drinking water treatment plants (WTP) is considered to be a feasible method to enhance pollutant removal efficiency, we were motivated to evaluate the genotoxicity of water samples from two pilot-scale drinking water treatment systems, one with recycling of combined backwash water, the other one with a conventional process. An integrated approach of the comet and micronucleus (MN) assays was used with zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) to investigate the water genotoxicity in this study. The total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP), of the recycling process were lower than that of the conventional process. All the results showed that there was no statistically significant difference ( P \u00a0u003e\u00a00.05) between the conventional and recycling processes, and indicated that the genotoxicity of water samples from the recycling process did not accumulate in 15\u00a0day continuous recycling trial. It was worth noting that there was correlation between the concentrations of TOC, DOC, UV 254 , and THMFPs in water and the DNA damage score, with corresponding  R  2  values of 0.68, 0.63, 0.28, and 0.64. Nevertheless, both DNA strand breaks and MN frequency of all water samples after disinfection were higher than that of water samples from the two treatment units, which meant that the disinfection by-products (DBPs) formed by disinfection could increase the DNA damage. Both the comet and MN tests suggest that the recycling process did not increase the genotoxicity risk, compared to the traditional process.",

They enter the aqueous environment, where they are frequently detected, and can lead to a threat to human health. Drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) play a key role in removing FQs from potable water. This study investigated the occurrence and removal of four selected FQs (norfloxacin (NOR), ciprofloxacin (CIP), enrofloxacin (ENR), and ofloxacin (OFL)) in three urban DWTPs in China. The treatment efficacy for each system was simultaneously evaluated. Two of the examined DWTPs used conventional treatment processes. The third used conventional processes followed by additional treatment processes (ozonation-biologically activated carbon (ozonation-BAC) and membrane technology). The average concentrations of the four FQs in the source water and the finished water ranged from 51 to 248\u00a0ng/L and from <5 to 46\u00a0ng/L, respectively. Based on residual concentrations, the conventional treatment system had a low removal of FQs. In contrast, the addition of advanced treatment processes such as the ozonation-BAC and membranes, substantially improved the removal of FQs. The finding of this study has important implications: even though coagulation-sedimentation and chlorination treatment processes can remove most target FQs, the typical practice of advanced treatment processes is necessary for the further removal.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThere is an alternative method for the treatment of low-turbidity source water that reuses coagulation sludge as low-turbidity raw water to enhance conventional coagulation efficiency. This research investigated the impact of the recycling ration by volume of coagulation sludge on enhancing the removal efficiency of specific water quality parameters in a pilot-scale experiment with a capacity of 5\u00a0m3/h. This novel test was first continuously run for 150\u00a0h (15 recycling runs), and the recycling sludge was cycle used. The results showed a significantly higher removal efficiency of turbidity from the raw water than that of the traditional process, which was probably attributed to the special long-range Van der Waals attractive force, the enhancement of the collision ratio among particles, and the similar \u201csecond dosage of coagulant\u201d strategy after the recycling process. Charge neutralization and absorption have mainly enhanced the removal efficiency of organic matter with recycling sludge. To some ex...",

        "abstract": "There is increasing concern that early-life exposure to endocrine disruptors affects male offspring reproduction. However, whether di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), a widely used endocrine disruptor, has transgenerational effects and, if so, the exact underlying molecular mechanisms involved remain unknown. In our study, 5 of time-mated pregnant SD rats were exposed to 0 and 500\u2009mg/kg DBP with corn oil as the vehicle via oral gavage from embryonic days (E8-E14). Epigenetic and metabolomic of testis were analyzed after post-natal 60 days. Sperm and testicular cell functions were examined to confirm the transgenerational effects. DBP exposure significantly decreased the sperm counts in F1 through F3 generation. We found distinct metabolic changes in the testis of both F1 and F3 generation offspring, specifically, a significantly increased level of betaine, which is an important methyl donor. In contrast, the expression of betaine homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT), which catalyzes the transfer of methyl moiety from betaine to homocysteine, significantly decreased. There was accompanying global DNA hypomethylation, along with a reduction in follistatin-like 3 (Fstl3) promoter hypomethylation, which is a known modulator of Sertoli cell number and spermatogenesis. In summary, we conclude that metabolomic and epigenetic changes induced by the aberrant expression of BHMT represent a novel mechanism linking in utero DBP exposure to transgenerational spermatogenesis failure.",

        "abstract": "An electric field was introduced into the catalytic oxidation of lean methane at low temperature over MnxCoy catalysts. Mn1Co5 exhibited the best catalytic performance with the light off temperature (T50) as low as 271 \u00b0C in the electric field, nearly 60 \u00b0C lower than that in a conventional reaction system. The electric field promoted the formation of octahedrally coordinated Mn3+ with active oxygen species released from the reduction of octahedrally coordinated Co3+ in Co3O4 spinel. Also, octahedrally coordinated Mn3+ sites were proven to be the main active sites for methane catalytic oxidation. With an in situ FTIR technique, it was found that the oxygen species from the catalyst bulk instead of gaseous oxygen will adsorb on the octahedrally coordinated Mn3+ sites in the electric field, promoting the activation of CH4 at low temperature. The dehydroxylation process will be accelerated through the formation of CoO(OH) species that will quickly convert due to the enhanced reducibility of Co3+ in the elect...",

        "title": "Management of multiple heterogeneous UAVs using capability and autonomy visualisation: Theory, experiment and result",
        "abstract": "The interest in utilising multiple heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in close proximity is growing rapidly. As such, many challenges are presented in the effective coordination and management of these UAVs; converting the current n-to-1 paradigm (n operators operating a single UAV) to the 1-to-n paradigm (one operator managing n UAVs). This paper introduces an Information Abstraction methodology used to produce the functional capability framework initially proposed by Chen et al. and its Level Of Detail (LOD) indexing scale. This framework was validated through comparing the operator workload and Situation Awareness (SA) of three experiment scenarios involving multiple autonomously heterogeneous UAVs. The first scenario was set in a high LOD configuration with highly abstracted UAV functional information; the second scenario was set in a mixed LOD configuration; and the final scenario was set in a low LOD configuration with maximal UAV functional information. Results show that there is a significant statistical decrease in operator workload when a UAV's functional information is displayed at its physical form (low LOD - maximal information) when comparing to the mixed LOD configuration.",

        "title": "Impact of microstructure and crystallinity on surface exchange kinetics of strontium titanium iron oxide perovskite by in situ optical transmission relaxation approach",
        "abstract": "The rate of oxygen exchange at the surface of mixed conductors is a critical property impacting the performance of elevated temperature energy conversion/storage devices. Microstructural features, such as grain boundary density and crystalline quality, are expected to impact the surface exchange kinetics, but their effect has not yet been widely studied. In this work, mixed conducting perovskite SrTi0.65Fe0.35O3\u2212\u03b4 (STF35) thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition were applied as a model system to systematically study the effect of microstructure on oxygen surface exchange kinetics. The impact of growth temperature on crystalline quality, orientation, grain size, surface roughness, and surface chemistry was evaluated by X-ray diffraction, scanning probe microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AR-XPS). A contact-free, continuous, in situ optical transmission relaxation approach was then applied to quantify the filmsu0027 native surface oxygen exchange coefficients (kchem). Amorphous films, grown at low temperatures (25 \u00b0C), did not exhibit measurable oxygen exchange ability. Highly crystalline films, grown at high temperatures (800 \u00b0C), exhibited reasonable, but not optimal kchem. The most rapid kchem was found for intermediate growth conditions, i.e., for amorphous-grown thin films just after crystallization at higher temperatures (550 \u00b0C) or for films grown near (580 \u00b0C) the crystallization temperature. Combined with the AR-XPS results showing greater surface Sr concentrations in films grown at higher temperatures, results suggest rapid kchem is obtained as a trade-off between good crystalline quality and low Sr surface concentration. Degradation of kchem over time was correlated to increased Sr surface concentration. Additionally, (100)-oriented epitaxial vs. nano-columnar grained (110)-oriented thin films with excellent crystalline quality exhibited very similar kchem and aging behavior, suggesting that neither grain boundaries nor film orientation cause observable changes in surface exchange kinetics in this composition.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Oxide anodes composed of 60\u00a0wt% Gd 0.1 Ce 0.8 Ni 0.1 O 2  (GDCN)- 40\u00a0wt% (Sr 0.9 La 0.1 ) 0.9 Ti 0.9 Ni 0.1 O 3  (SLTN) composites were prepared and tested on (ZrO 2 ) 0.89 (Sc 2 O 3 ) 0.1 (CeO 2 ) 0.01  (SSZ) electrolyte-supported SOFC cells utilizing a (La 0.75 Sr 0.25 ) 0.98 MnO 3  (LSM)-SSZ cathode, in 3%-humidified hydrogen fuel at 800\u00a0\u00b0C. Improved electrochemical performance was found compared to the cell using Ni-free 60\u00a0wt% Gd 0.1 Ce 0.9 O 2  (GDC) - 40\u00a0wt % Sr 0.9 La 0.1 TiO 3  (SLT) that was attributed to the exsolution of nano-sized Ni particles from the Ni-doped system. This exsolution process represents a simpler, more attractive method to improve performance than the more conventional but more complicated infiltration method for introducing catalytic nanoparticles. Redox cycling testing was performed to investigate the performance and structural stability of the Ni-doped GDC-SLT anode. The results indicated that the Ni exsolution and aggregation occurred while redox cycling proceeded, resulting in a gradually reduced anodic overvoltage. Symmetric cells with dense thin film Gd 0.1 Ce 0.9-x Ni x O 2  (x\u00a0=\u00a00, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15) electrodes were also tested, demonstrating lower area-specific resistances with increasing Ni content on the surface under reducing conditions. The steady improvement during redox cycling, despite Ni agglomeration, is related to the continuous increase in the overall Ni content on the anode surface, which may be enabled by kinetic limitations to Ni re-dissolving under oxidizing transients.",

        "abstract": "The ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related kinase (ATR) has a key role in the signalling of stalled replication forks and DNA damage to cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair. It has long been recognised as an important target for cancer therapy but inhibitors have proved elusive. As NU6027, originally developed as a CDK2 inhibitor, potentiated cisplatin in a CDK2-independent manner we postulated that it may inhibit ATR.Cellular ATR kinase activity was determined by CHK1 phosphorylation in human fibroblasts with inducible dominant-negative ATR-kinase dead expression and human breast cancer MCF7 cells. Cell cycle effects and chemo- and radiopotentiation by NU6027 were determined in MCF7 cells and the role of mismatch repair and p53 was determined in isogenically matched ovarian cancer A2780 cells.NU6027 is a potent inhibitor of cellular ATR activity (IC(50)=6.7 \u03bcM) and enhanced hydroxyurea and cisplatin cytotoxicity in an ATR-dependent manner. NU6027 attenuated G2/M arrest following DNA damage, inhibited RAD51 focus formation and increased the cytotoxicity of the major classes of DNA-damaging anticancer cytotoxic therapy but not the antimitotic, paclitaxel. In A2780 cells sensitisation to cisplatin was greatest in cells with functional p53 and mismatch repair (MMR) and sensitisation to temozolomide was greatest in p53 mutant cells with functional MMR. Importantly, NU6027 was synthetically lethal when DNA single-strand break repair is impaired either through poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition or defects in XRCC1.NU6027 inhibits ATR, impairing G2/M arrest and homologous recombination thus increasing sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and PARP inhibitors. It provides proof of concept data for clinical development of ATR inhibitors.",

Despite recent advances in surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, current treatment regimens have only a marginal impact on patient survival. In this study, we constructed a novel nanoparticle containing neuritin peptide with grp170. The nanoparticle could elicit a neuritin-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte response to lyse glioma cells in vitro. In addition, the nanoparticle could inhibit tumor growth and improve the lifespan of tumor-bearing mice in vivo. Taken together, the results demonstrated that the nanoparticle can inhibit tumor growth and represents a promising therapy for glioma.",

        "abstract": "B2O3- or P2O5-doped Li2O-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 (LMAS) glass-ceramics were prepared by solid state method using Li2CO3, MgO, Al2O3 and SiO2 as the raw materials, B2O3 or P2O5 as the additives. The effects of adding B2O3 and P2O5 on the phase separation, crystallization and thermal expansion coefficient were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential thermal analysis (DTA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermal dilatometer, respectively. The results showed that B2O3 or P2O5 addition could promoted phase separation of glass and increased the size of spherical phase separation droplet. With the addition of B2O3 or P2O5, the crystallization temperatures (Tc) of LMAS system decreased from 764 oC to 726 oC and 764 oC to 750 oC, respectively. However, the crystalline phase compositions did not changed, and \u03b2-quartz solid solution (s.s) (Li2Al2Si3O10) was still the main crystalline phase, and lithium silicate (Li2SiO3) and forsterite (Mg2SiO4) were the minor phases. The thermal expansion coefficient (\u03b1) of B2O3-doped and P2O5-doped LMAS glass-ceramics in the temperature range 20-600 oC were 5.215\u00d710-6/ oC and 5.008\u00d710-6/ oC, respectively, which were higher than that of LMAS glass-ceramics (\u03b1=3.790\u00d710-6/ oC).",

After calcining, nature plants, i.e. sisal and bamboo leaves, were carbonized and occluded in ZrSiO 4  matrix. The FT-IR and XRD results demonstrated that the plants were not affect the non-hydrolytic sol-gel polycondensation reaction, resulting in the pure ZrSiO 4  formation. Both inclusion pigments presented deep black hue, i.e.  L  \u2217 \u202f=\u202f34.93 and 33.02 for sisal and bamboo leaves, respectively, which was contributed to the homogeneous pore-size distribution and high carbon yield of the plants. These pigments have many distinguished advantages including low cost, high chromatic performance and excellent thermal stability, making them promising candidates for ceramic decoration.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   High quality zirconia whiskers have been successfully prepared by molten salt method, using zirconium oxychloride (ZrOCl 2 \u00b78H 2 O) and sodium phosphate tribasic dodecahydrate (Na 3 PO 4 \u00b712H 2 O) as precursor and molten salt, respectively. The effects of types of molten salt and heat treatment temperature on the formation of zirconia whiskers were characterized by XRD, Raman, DTA-TG, FE-SEM, TEM, SAED and HR-TEM. When Na 3 PO 4 \u00b712H 2 O is utilized as molten salt and the heat treatment temperature is 900\u202f\u00b0C, the as-prepared zirconia whiskers with length ranging from 4\u202f\u00b5m to 8\u202f\u00b5m show an average aspect ratio of 25. The obtained ZrO 2  whiskers with monoclinic structure are elongated along [010] direction and exhibit a smooth surface with no distinct defects. The XRD and Raman results reveal that the phase transformation from tetragonal zirconia to monoclinic zirconia occurs with the increased crystal size and the water quenching treatment can significantly reduce the content of sodium zirconium phosphate [Na 9\u20134\u00d7 Zr x (PO 4 ) 3 ] in the final product. The growth mechanism of zirconia whiskers is supposed to be a dissolution-precipitation process. Since the sodium zirconium phosphate [Na 9\u20134\u00d7 Zr x (PO 4 ) 3 ] effectively promotes the dissolution of zirconia in liquid molten salt, zirconia can grow into zirconia whiskers according to its anisotropy.",

The CIE coordination L* value decreased with the increase of TEOS amounts due to the pure zircon formation.

        "abstract": "Abstract   The zircon-based encapsulation carbon black (C@ZrSiO 4 ) inorganic pigments with controllable size were successfully prepared by non-aqueous sol-gel method with the assistance of soft mechano-chemistry (SMC) activation precursors. The XRD and FT-IR results showed that the SMC activation enhanced the reactivity of precursors and facilitated the formation of ZrSiO 4  phase with the calcination temperature at 900\u20131050\u202f\u00b0C, indicating the successfully synthesis of pure ZrSiO 4  phase. The average size of C@ZrSiO 4  inorganic pigments significantly declined from 45.20 to 4.50\u202f\u03bcm with the increase of SMC activation time of precursors, however, the  L*  values of pigments increased from 24.11 to 46.35. It was mainly because of the decreased amounts of protected carbon in ZrSiO 4  matrix and the enhanced light reflectance, which lead to the slight color change from deep black to gray black tone. The colored glaze samples presented a black hue after applied in the ceramic glaze at 1200\u202f\u00b0C. Moreover, the black hue intensity of glazed samples was higher than that of the corresponding C@ZrSiO 4  inorganic pigments, indicating the prepared pigments have excellent tinctorial strength and hiding power. These results ensure that the obtained C@ZrSiO 4  inorganic pigments possess the outstanding chromatic performance, excellent high-temperature stability, high chemical stability and suitable particle size, and exhibit great potential in the application of the industrial ceramic decoration.",

        "abstract": "A facile approach towards photoluminescent (PL) Cu-In-Zn-S quantum dots (CIZS QDs) has been developed by the microwave treatment with the assist of room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL). Due to the high polarizability, RTIL was served as a microwave absorbent, resulting in the increase of the instantaneous nucleation rate and the rapid synthesis of CIZS QDs at low temperature. Meanwhile, the surface decoration of QDs with RTIL can passivate the surface defect greatly. The PL intensity of the CIZS QDs depends on the anion species, alkyl chain length of the RTIL, and the metal elements ratios of QDs. Based on the variable of PL peak position and extended luminescence lifetime of CIZS QDs, the superior emission behavior of QDs was confirmed by the surface etching of fluoride produced by the hydrolysis of RTIL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Bmim]BF4). Moreover, the intermediate alkyl chain of RTIL can avoid aggregation, resulting in the construction of CIZS QDs with homogenous size distribution. The shape controlled CIZS QDs presented widened tunable emission peak from 677 nm to 579 nm compared with that of a conventional one-pot method by mixing the raw materials. It also exhibited high quantum yield (QY) as 24.1% after coating with ZnS shell. This method is expected to be a useful technique for rapid synthesis of multiple QDs with wider range of emission wavelength and higher QY for variety of applications.",

The ZrSiO 4  sol reached homogeneous mixing at atomic level and then directly turned into gel through polycondensation on NHSG process. The cotton cellulose was well dispersed in the ZrSiO 4  sol due to its hollow fibrous filament structure, and then was carbonized and occluded in zircon matrix which preserved against carbon oxidation and pyrolysis at high temperature. The chromatic value  L * decreased gradually and then increased slightly with increasing the chromophoric carbon amount. The coupling agent (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) enhanced the connection between cotton cellulose and zircon, resulting in the deeper hue at 950\u00a0\u00b0C, as  L * value was 39.09 and 53.37, respectively. The as-prepared inclusion pigments possessed strong tinting strength in glaze at 1200\u00a0\u00b0C, making them promising candidates for ceramic-ware decoration.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This paper reported the synthesis and gas-sensing properties of Pt nanoparticles modified Al-doped ZnO (AZO) macro-/mesoporous nanosheets, which were prepared via a solution combustion approach with a subsequent heat treatment at 400\u00a0\u00b0C for 50\u00a0min. The high performance in detecting butane were achieved for the well-adhered products with unique porous surface appearance on the sensors fabricated using indirect heating method, which demonstrated the superiority of solution combustion synthesis (SCS) in synthesizing complex oxides. The possible explanations of the high butane gas-sensing characteristics of these sensors were based on the results of BET and XPS. The large surface area could provide sufficient interface between the materials and butane gas, and the adsorbed oxygen species having strong oxidation activity could break the butane molecules into CO 2  and H 2 O. The gas-sensing properties of Pt-modified AZO were investigated by testing the gas responses towards butane. The maximum response of the 5% Pt-AZO based gas sensor reached 56.52\u20133000\u00a0ppm butane at 200\u00a0\u00b0C. What\u2019s more, the sensor also exhibited good short- and long-term stability, repeatability and selectivity, which made it a potential candidate in the application of monitoring butane. In the end, the possible mechanisms of gas-sensing properties were discussed.",

The effects of the NAA amount and heat treatment temperature on the structure and properties of the synthesized encapsulation pigments were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, FE-SEM, HR-TEM, EDS, XPS and CIELAB colorimeter, respectively. The results showed that the C@ZrSiO 4  encapsulated pigments heating at 1000\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u202fh in N 2  atmosphere presented a dense and stable encapsulation structure as well as deep dark hue when the mole ratio of NAA and Zr (NAA/Zr) was 3:1, and the chromaticity values were  L* \u202f= 21.20,  a* \u202f= 0.56,  b* \u202f= \u22120.09 and C ab  =\u202f0.57, respectively, which were contributed to the high homogeneity at atomic level in ZrSiO 4  sol and the tight bonding between carbon black carbonized by carbon containing group and zircon matrix. In addition, the pigment exhibited excellent chemical stability, thermal stability and tinctorial strength when it was used in water, acid, alkali, organic solvents and ceramic glaze. Especially, these pigments improved the utilization of raw materials and avoided the use of heavy metals or transition metals as coloring agent, which was an environment-friendly black ceramic pigment.",

Results showed that the specific surface area of rod-like MNBG (RBG) with highly ordered mesoporous structure was higher than that of spherical MNBG (SBG) with irregular worm-like mesoporous structure. Both the MNBG showed the high apatite-forming ability, and the apatite-forming ability of RBG with higher specific surface area was higher than that of SBG. Futhermore, both SBG and RBG had good biocompatibility, could promote proliferation and ALP differentiation of human dental pulp cells (HDPCs), and SBG with a smaller aspect ratio could significantly increase the proliferation and differentiation of the cells, as compared to RBG. This study may motivate the development and applications of MNBG with controllable morphology in dental repair.",

Replacing Pr 4+  for Zr 4+  in ZrSiO 4  increased the cell volume and changed the color from white to yellow gradually. The Si\u2015O\u2015Zr and Si\u2015O\u2015Pr bands were observed in the FT-IR spectra of xerogel, indicating it could reach homogeneous mixing at the atomic level. Therefore, it promoted the solid solution reaction between Pr and zircon at low temperature. The samples exhibit high doping limitation (x\u202f=\u202f0.08) and brilliant yellow hue ( b  * \u202f=\u202f69.48) in contrast with the previously reported praseodymium zircon yellow pigments. The intense of yellow hue was increased with increasing the Pr doping content due to the increase of Pr 4+ /Pr 3+  species. After applying on bisque ceramic tiles, the pigment exhibited excellent coloration, high thermal stability and low solubility in molten glazes, indicating its potential application in ceramic decoration.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A novel silicate oxyapatite red phosphor Ba 2 La 4 Y 4 (SiO 4 ) 6 O 2 :Eu 3+  was synthesized by solid state reaction method. The results show that Eu 3+  ions replace La 3+  ions can lead to higher luminescence intensity than replacing Y 3+  ions. Moreover, Ba 2 La 4 Y 4 (SiO 4 ) 6 O 2 :Eu 3+  shows a high quantum yield of 67.46% and high thermal stability (the luminescence intensity remains 94.1% of its initial PL intensity at 125\u202f\u00b0C, and maintains 77.6% at 150\u202f\u00b0C) by regulating the relative content of Y 3+  ions and La 3+  ions.

        "abstract": "In this study, we aimed at investigating effects of lncRNA ADAMTS9-AS2 on lung cancer progression through regulating miR-223-3p and TGFBR3 expressions. Expressions of ADAMTS9-AS2 in lung cancer tissues and cell lines were determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). TargetScan and miRcode were used to predict the targeting relationships, respectively. The luciferase reporter system was used to verify that the relationship among ADAMTS9-AS2, TGFBR3 and miR-223-3p. Western blot assay tested the protein level changes in TGFBR3. Cell proliferation was determined by CCK-8 assay. Cell cycle and cell apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry assay, and migration and invasion were determined by transwell assay. Tumor xenograft model was developed to study the influence of ADAMTS9-AS2 on tumor growth in vivo. qRT-PCR results demonstrated that lncADAMTS9-AS2 was lowly expressed in lung cancer tissues. High expression of ADAMTS9-AS2 in lung cancer cells significantly reduced proliferation ability and inhibited migration, as well as elevating their apoptosis rate. In vivo assay found that ADAMTS9-AS2 suppressed the lung tumor growth. Bioinformatics predicted that miR-223-3p bound directly to the ADAMTS9-AS2 and TGFBR3, which was later confirmed by luciferase reporter system. ADAMTS9-AS2 transfection increased TGFBR3 mRNA and protein expressions in lung cancer cells, but miR-223-3p transfection significantly decreased them. Besides, our results showed that miR-223-3p induced cellular apoptosis while TGFBR3 group showed the complete opposite effect. It was proved that ADAMTS9-AS2 and TGFBR3 were the direct genes of miR-223-3p. MiR-223-3p promotes proliferation, migration and invasion of lung cancer cells by targeting TGFBR3. Therefore, ADAMTS9-AS2, miR-223-3p and TGFBR3 may provide potential targets for the treatment of lung cancer patients. \u00a9 2018 IUBMB Life, 2018.",

        "abstract": " Doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective therapeutic drug for malignant tumors; however, its clinical applications were limited by its side effects, especially the cardiotoxicity caused by ROS-mediated p53 and MAPK signal pathways' activation-induced cell apoptosis. Sanyang Xuedai mixture (SYKT) has been reported as an antioxidant agent and attenuated DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by targeting ROS-mediated apoptosis, but the mechanisms are still not fully delineated.  This study aimed at investigating whether SYKT alleviated DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by inhibiting ROS-mediated apoptosis and elucidating the role of ROS-mediated p53 and MAPK signal pathways' activation in this process.  Identification, separation, and culture of mouse primary cardiomyocytes. Cells were treated with DOX (1 M), SYKT (30 mg/mL), or SYKT coupled with DOX. The p53 inhibitor Pifithrin- (PFT-), p38/MAPK inhibitor SB203583 (SB), and JNK inhibitor SP600125 (SP) were used as positive control. Western blot was employed to detected p53 and p38 as well as JNK expressions and the activation and translocation of Bax and cytochrome C. Flow cytometer (FCM) was used to detect the mitochondrial membrane potential and cell apoptosis.  After separation and culture, 95% of cells showed positive cTnI expression, which indicated that mouse primary cardiomyocytes were successfully identified in our research. DOX activated p53 and MAPK signal pathways in a time-dependent manner, which were inactivated by being cotreated with SYKT, PFT-, or SB, respectively. DOX significantly decreased Bax and increased cytochrome c expressions in the cytoplasm, whereas Bax was upregulated and cytochrome c was downregulated in the mitochondria, which were reversed by SYKT treatment. Besides, DOX reduced mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) in cardiomyocytes compared to the control group; SYKT recovered its MMP and attenuated DOX-induced cardiomyocyte injury. Of note, DOX increased the expression levels of cleaved caspase-3 as well as poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and promoted cell apoptosis, which were also reversed by SYKT treatment.  Our results indicated that SYKT alleviated DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by inhibiting p53 and MAPK signal pathways' activation-mediated apoptosis, and it might serve as a potential therapeutic agent for DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.",

        "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is an antineoplastic drug widely used for the treatment of various types of cancer; however, it can induce severe side effects, such as myelosuppression and cardiotoxicity. Sanyang Xuedai (SYKT) is a natural medicine originating from an ancient prescription of the Dai nationality in Southwest China. With eight Chinese herbal medicines, including sanguis draconis, radix et rhizoma notoginseng, radix et rhizoma glycyrrhizae and radix angelicae sinensis as the primary ingredients, SYKT has been reported to possess numerous biological functions. The present study investigated whether SYKT can confer protection against DOX\u2011induced myelosuppression and cardiotoxicity, and explored the potential mechanism involved. Mice were treated with DOX, SYKT or a combination of the two; hematopoietic functions were assessed by measuring the number of peripheral blood cells, cluster of differentiation CD34+/CD44+ bone marrow cells and apoptotic cells. Myocardial enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase (CK) and its isoform CK\u2011MB, were assessed using a biochemical analyzer. The apoptotic rate of cardiomyocytes was assessed using flow cytometry. Histopathological analysis was conducted using hematoxylin\u2011eosin staining. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was evaluated using a dichlorofluorescein intensity assay. The mice treated with DOX exhibited a reduced survival rate, reduced peripheral blood and CD34+/CD44+ cell counts, elevated myocardial enzymes and apoptotic indices in bone marrow cells and cardiomyocytes, all of which were effectively prevented by SYKT co\u2011administration. Furthermore, bone marrow cells and myocytes from mice treated with DOX demonstrated increased dichlorofluorescein intensity, which was attenuated by SYKT. Notably, SYKT did not interfere with the effects of DOX on tumor volume or the induction of tumor cell apoptosis in tumor\u2011bearing mice. The present study indicated that SYKT may counteract DOX\u2011induced myelosuppression and cardiotoxicity through inhibiting ROS\u2011mediated apoptosis. These findings suggested that SYKT may have potential as a means to counteract the potentially fatal hematopoietic and cardiac complications associated with DOX treatment.",

        "abstract": "Brachytherapy is regarded as the most effective method in the treatment of metastatic spinal tumors since little damage is caused to surrounding healthy tissue. However, this method may cause radiation myelopathy if an overdose occurs. In the present study, we established a Banna mini-pig (125)I spinal cord implantation model to provide a tool for the study of how to reduce these types of side effects. Cell cycle alteration, apoptosis and necrosis of spinal cord neurons in the presence of various doses and durations of (125)I brachytherapy were also investigated. The pigs were randomly divided into four groups, A, B, C and D. In group A, four (125)I seeds (total radioactivity, 4.0 mCi) were implanted into the dura mater of the spinal canal at the level of T13. In groups B and C, eight (125)I sources (total radioactivity, 8.0 mCi) were inserted at the same location. Groups A and C were raised for up to 8 months and group B for only 2 months. Neurons from the swine spinal cord at the T13 level were collected and cell cycle analysis was performed. Apoptosis and necrosis were tested by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay. The Banna mini-pig brachytherapy model was successfully established. Radiation myelopathy was closely associated with radiation dose and duration, more neurons were blocked in the G2 and S phases as dose and time increased, and an increase in apoptosis and necrosis was detected. Ratios of apoptosis and necrosis were reduced as lower doses and shorter durations of radiation were applied. Our results demonstrate that the Banna mini-pig is an ideal animal to study (125)I brachytherapy. Low-dose and short-term brachytherapy may effectively decrease apoptosis and necrosis in spinal cord cells in Banna mini-pigs.",

        "abstract": "Multidrug resistance (MDR) is an obstacle for cancer chemotherapy. It was reported that 20(S)-ginsenoside Rg3 (hereafter Rg3) was able to regulate MDR in mouse leukemia cells. The present study investigated the effect of Rg3 on the MDR of A549 lung cancer cells. A cell viability assay revealed that Rg3 treatment increased cisplatin (DDP) cytotoxicity in DDP resistant A549 cells (A549/DDP). Furthermore, Rg3 increases the antitumor effect of DDP on A549/DDP xenograft mice. The expression of MDR-mediated proteins, including P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated protein (MPR1) and lung resistance protein 1 (LPR1), was detected in tumor tissue of A549/DDP xenograft mice. The results revealed that Rg3 treatment inhibited the expression of these MDR-associated proteins. Additionally, technetium-99m labeled hexakis-2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (Tc-MIBI) single-photon emission computed tomography was used to monitor the effect of Rg3 on cisplatin sensitivity of A549/DDP xenograft tumors. It was observed that uptake of Tc-MIBI was increased by Rg3 treatment, which indicated that Rg3 is able to effectively enhance chemotherapy sensitivity of A549/DDP xenograft tumors. Taken together, these results revealed that Rg3 may be able to reverse MDR of lung cancer via the downregulation of P-gp, MPR1 and LPR1.",

        "abstract": "Considering the resistance of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) I therapy, this study was designed to find a solution at molecular respect. By probing into lncRNA-NEAT1/miR-101-3p/FN1 axis and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, this study provided a potential target for PTC therapy. I-resistant cell lines were established by continuous treatment with median-lethal I. Bioinformatic analysis was applied to filtrate possible lncRNA/miRNA/mRNA and related signaling pathway. Luciferase reporter assay was employed in the verification of the targeting relationship between lncRNA and miRNA as well as miRNA and mRNA. MTT assay and flow cytometry assay were performed to observe the impact of NEAT1/miR-101-3p/FN1 on cell viability and apoptosis in radioactivity iodine (RAI)-resistant PTC cell lines, respectively. Western blot and qRT-PCR were conducted to measure the expression of proteins and mRNAs in RAI-resistant PTC tissues and cells. Meanwhile, endogenous PTC mice model were constructed, in order to verify the relation between NEAT1 and RAI-resistance in vivo. NEAT1 was over-expressed in RAI-resistant PTC tissues and cell lines and could resist RAI by accelerating proliferation accompanied by suppressing apoptosis. It indicated that overexpressed NEAT1 restrained the damage of RAI to tumor in both macroscopic and microcosmic. Besides, NEAT1/miR-101-3p exhibited a negative correlation by directly targeting each other. The expression of FN1, an overexpressed downstream protein in RAI-resistance PTC tissues, could be tuned down by miR-101-3p, while the decrease could be restored by NEAT1. In conclusion, both in vitro and in vivo, NEAT1 suppression could inhibit I resistance of PTC by upregulating miR-101-3p/FN1 expression and inactivated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway both in vitro and in vivo.",

        "abstract": "[18F]fluoro\u20112\u2011deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)\u2011computed tomography\u00a0(CT) is a functional imaging modality based on glucose metabolism. The association between the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) from 18F\u2011FDG PET\u2011CT scanning and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status has, to the best of our knowledge, not previously been fully elucidated, and the potential mechanisms by which EGFR mutations alter FDG uptake are largely unknown. A total of 157\u00a0patients who were pathologically diagnosed with non\u2011small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent EGFR mutation testing and PET\u2011CT pretreatment between June 2015 and October 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. \u03c72 and univariate analyses were performed to identify the contributors to EGFR mutation. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was analyzed, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Glucose transporter\u00a01 (GLUT1) and NADPH oxidase\u00a04 (NOX4) expression, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity were detected in the A549 (wild\u2011type), PC\u20119 (EGFR mutation\u2011positive, EGFR exon 19del) and NCI\u2011H1975 (EGFR mutation\u2011positive, combined with L858R and T790M substitution) cell lines. A total of 109\u00a0patients who met the criteria were enrolled, and 63 of those tested as EGFR mutation\u2011positive. The SUVmax values were significantly lower in patients with EGFR mutations (mean, 6.52\u00b10.38) compared with in patients with wild\u2011type EGFR (mean, 9.37\u00b10.31; P<0.001). Using univariate analysis, EGFR mutation status was significantly associated with sex, smoking status, tumor histology and SUVmax of the primary tumor. In the multivariate analysis, smoking status (never\u2011smoking), histopathology (adenocarcinoma) and SUVmax (\u22649.91) were the statistically significant predictors of EGFR mutations. ROC curve analysis identified that the SUVmax cut\u2011off point was 9.92, for which the AUC was 0.75 (95% confidence interval, 0.68\u20110.83). Reverse transcription\u2011polymerase chain reaction indicated that the GLUT1 mRNA decreased in the PC\u20119 and NCI\u2011H1975 cell lines compared with the A549 cell line (0.82\u00b10.07 and 0.72\u00b10.04 vs. 0.98\u00b10.04, respectively; P<0.05) and decreased ROS activity was observed in the PC\u20119 cell line. Furthermore, the expression of NOX4 mRNA decreased by 20% in PC\u20119 (P<0.01) and by 14% (P<0.05) in NCI\u2011H1975 cells. In addition, NOX4 protein expression decreased by 13% in PC\u20119 and by 16% in NCI\u2011H1975 cells (both P<0.05) compared with the A549 cell line. The SUVmax could be considered to effectively predict EGFR mutation status of patients with NSCLC, and the EGFR mutation status may alter FDG uptake partially via the NOX4/ROS/GLUT1 axis.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:This study is aiming to identify the smallest field size for which a treatment planning system (TPS) can accurately calculate the relative dose distribution. The finding would be used as a guideline to choose the smallest proton field for clinical treatment.Methods:Mevion S250\u2122 double scattering proton delivery system and Eclipse\u2122 TPS (Varian) with pencil beam convolution (PBC) dose algorithm were used in this study. Square sized fields of 1 cm, 2 cm, 3 cm, 4 cm, 5 cm, and 10 cm were planned on a cubical water phantom with iso-center placed at 10 cm depth. All beams used the same proton beam option: range 15 cm and modulation 10 cm. Dose in water was calculated without any compensator. Gafchromic\u2122 EBT3 film and diode detectors were used to measure the central axis dose distribution and lateral dose profiles at 5 cm, 10 cm, and 14 cm depth.Results:The preliminary film measurement shows good agreement between Eclipse calculated lateral dose profiles for all tested field sizes. The differences on full width half maximum were \u2264 1 mm while the differences on the penumbras were between 1 mm and 2 mm between Eclipse and film. For the depth dose, Eclipse results matched well with film measurements for field sizes down to 2 cm2. With smaller field size of 1 cm2, Eclipse was able to predict the decreasing of SOBP due to the lack of lateral charged particle equilibrium in depth. However, it did not match the film measurement. Diode measurement results will be available at the time of presentation.Conclusion:The PBC dose algorithm in Eclipse can accurately calculate relative dose distribution in double scattered proton system for field size down to 2 cm2.",

        "abstract": "In electron and proton radiotherapy, applications of patient-specific electron bolus or proton compensators during radiation treatments are often necessary to accommodate patient body surface irregularities, tissue inhomogeneity, and variations in PTV depths to achieve desired dose distributions. Emerging 3D printing technologies provide alternative fabrication methods for these bolus and compensators. This study investigated the potential of utilizing 3D printing technologies for the fabrication of the electron bolus and proton compensators. Two printing technologies, fused deposition modeling (FDM) and selective laser sintering (SLS), and two printing materials, PLA and polyamide, were investigated. Samples were printed and characterized with CT scan and under electron and proton beams. In addition, a software package was developed to convert electron bolus and proton compensator designs to printable Standard Tessellation Language file format. A phantom scalp electron bolus was printed with FDM technology with PLA material. The HU of the printed electron bolus was 106.5 \u00b1 15.2. A prostate patient proton compensator was printed with SLS technology and polyamide material with -70.1 \u00b1 8.1 HU. The profiles of the electron bolus and proton compensator were compared with the original designs. The average over all the CT slices of the largest Euclidean distance between the design and the fabricated bolus on each CT slice was found to be 0.84 \u00b1 0.45 mm and for the compensator to be 0.40 \u00b1 0.42 mm. It is recommended that the properties of specific 3D printed objects are understood before being applied to radiotherapy treatments. ",

        "abstract": "Purpose: In room kilovoltage x-ray (kV) imaging provides higher contrast than Megavoltage (MV) imaging with faster acquisition time compared with on-board cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), thus improving patient setup accuracy and efficiency. In this study we evaluated the clinical feasibility of utilizing kV imaging for whole breast radiation patient setup. Methods: For six breast cancer patients with whole breast treatment plans using two opposed tangential fields, MV-based patient setup was conducted by aligning patient markers with in room lasers and MV portal images. Beam-eye viewed kV images were acquired using Varian OBI system after the set up process. In house software was developed to transfer MLC blocks information overlaying onto kV images to demonstrate the field shape for verification. KV-based patient digital shift was derived by performing rigid registration between kV image and the digitally reconstructed radiography (DRR) to align the bony structure. This digital shift between kV-based and MV-based setup was defined as setup deviation. Results: Six sets of kV images were acquired for breast patients. The mean setup deviation was 2.3mm, 2.2mm and 1.8mm for anterior-posterior, superior-inferior and left-right direction respectively. The average setup deviation magnitude was 4.3\u00b11.7mm for six patients. Patient with large breast had a largermore\u00a0\u00bb setup deviation (4.4\u20136.2mm). There was no strong correlation between MV-based shift and setup deviation. Conclusion: A preliminary clinical workflow for kV-based whole breast radiation setup was established and tested. We observed setup deviation of the magnitude below than 5mm. With the benefit of providing higher contrast and MLC block overlaid on the images for treatment field verification, it is feasible to use kV imaging for breast patient setup.\u00ab\u00a0less",

        "abstract": "The goal of this study was to exam the efficacy of current DVH based clinical guidelines draw from photon experience for lung cancer radiation therapy on proton therapy. Comparison proton plans and IMRT plans were generated for 10 lung patients treated in our proton facility. A gEUD based plan evaluation method was developed for plan evaluation. This evaluation method used normal lung gEUD(a) curve in which the model parameter \"a\" was sampled from the literature reported value. For all patients, the proton plans delivered lower normal lung V with similar V and similar target coverage. Based on current clinical guidelines, proton plans were ranked superior to IMRT plans for all 10 patients. However, the proton and IMRT normal lung gEUD(a) curves crossed for 8 patients within the tested range of \"a\", which means there was a possibility that proton plan would be worse than IMRT plan for lung sparing. A concept of deficiency index (DI) was introduced to quantify the probability of proton plans doing worse than IMRT plans. By applying threshold on DI, four patients' proton plan was ranked inferior to the IMRT plan. Meanwhile if a threshold to the location of curve crossing was applied, 6 patients' proton plan was ranked inferior to the IMRT plan. The contradictory ranking results between the current clinical guidelines and the gEUD(a) curve analysis demonstrated there is potential pitfalls by applying photon experience directly to the proton world. A comprehensive plan evaluation based on radio-biological models should be carried out to decide if a lung patient would really be benefit from proton therapy.",

        "title": "SU-F-T-179: Fast and Accurate Profile Acquisition for Proton Beam Using Multi-Ion Chamber Arrays",
        "abstract": "Purpose:Proton beam profile measurement is more time-consuming than photon beam. Due to the energy modulation during proton delivery, chambers have to move step-by-step instead of continuously. Multi-ion chamber arrays are appealing to this task since multiple measurements can be performed at once. However, their utilization suffers from sparse spatial resolution and potential intrinsic volume-averaging effect of the disk-shaped ion chambers. We proposed an approach to measure proton beam profiles accurately and efficiently.Methods:Mevion S250 proton system and IBA Matrixx ion chamber arrays were used in this study. Matrixx has interchamber distance of 7.62 mm, and chamber diameter of 4.5 mm. We measured the same beam profile by moving the Matrixx seven times with 1 mm each time along y axis. All 7 measurements were superimposed to get a \u201cfiner\u201d profile with 1 mm spatial resolution. Coarser resolution profiles of 2 mm and 3 mm were also generated by using subsets of measurements. Those profiles were compared to the TPS calculated beam profile. Gamma analysis was performed for 2D dose maps to evaluate the difference to TPS dose plane.Results:Preliminary results showed a large discrepancy between the TPS calculated profile and the single measurement profile with 7.6 mm resolution. A good match could be achieved when the resolution reduced to 3 mm by adding one extra measurement. Gamma analysis for 2D dose map of a 10\u00d710 field showed a passing rate (\u03b3 \u2264 1) of 90.6% using a 3% and 3mm criterion for single measurement, which increased to 92.3% for 2-measurement superimposition, and slightly further increased to 92.9% for 7-measurement superimposition.Conclusion:The results indicated that 2 measurements shifted by 3mm using Matrixx generated a smooth proton beam profile with good matching to Eclipse beam profile. We suggest using this 2-measurement approach in clinic for double scattering proton beam profile measurement.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of Gafchromic film causes perturbation to absolute dosimetry measurements; the purpose of this work was to characterize the perturbation and develop a correction method for it. Three sets of Gafchromic EBT2 film were compared: radiation (control), radiation followed by MR imaging (RAD + B), and MR imaging followed by radiation (B + RAD). The T1-weighted and T2-weighted MR imaging was performed using a 1.5T scanner with the films wedged between two chicken legs. Doses from 0 to 800 cGy were delivered with a 6MV linac. The time interval between radiation and MR imaging was less than 10 min. Film calibration was generated from the red channel. Microscopic imaging was performed on two pieces of film. The effect of specific absorption rate (SAR) was determined by exposing another three sets of films to low, medium, and high levels of SAR through a series of pulse sequences. No discernible preferential alignment was detected on the microscopic images of the irradiated film exposed to MRI. No imaging artifacts were introduced by Gafchromic film on any MR images. On average, 4% dose difference was observed between B + RAD or RAD + B and the control, using the same calibration curve. The pixel values between the B + RAD or RAD + B and the control films were found to follow a linear relationship pixel(Control) = 1.02 \u00d7 pixel(B + RAD or RAD + B). By applying this correction, the average dose error was reduced to approximately 2%. The SAR experiment revealed a dose overestimation with increasing SAR even when the correction was applied. It was concluded that MR imaging introduces perturbation on Gafchromic film dose measurements by 4% on average, compared to calibrating the film without the presence of MRI. This perturbation can be corrected by applying a linear correction to the pixel values. Additionally, Gafchromic film did not introduce any imaging artifacts in any of the MR images acquired.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:To develop an imaging angle optimization methodology for orthogonal 2D cine MRI based radiotherapy guidance using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of target motion retrieved from 4DCT.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 4DCT of 6 patients with lung tumor. A radiation oncologist manually contoured the target volume at the maximal inhalation phase of the respiratory cycle. An object constrained deformable image registration (DIR) method has been developed to track the target motion along the respiration at ten phases. The motion of the center of the target mass has been analyzed using the PCA to find out the principal motion components that were uncorrelated with each other. Two orthogonal image planes for cineMRI have been determined using this method to minimize the through plane motion during MRI based radiotherapy guidance.Results:3D target respiratory motion for all 6 patients has been efficiently retrieved from 4DCT. In this process, the object constrained DIR demonstrated satisfactory accuracy and efficiency to enable the automatic motion tracking for clinical application. The average motion amplitude in the AP, lateral, and longitudinal directions were 3.6mm (min: 1.6mm, max: 5.6mm), 1.7mm (min: 0.6mm, max: 2.7mm), and 5.6mm (min: 1.8mm, max: 16.1mm), respectively. Based on PCA, the optimal orthogonal imaging planes were determined for cineMRI. The average angular difference between the PCA determined imaging planes and the traditional AP and lateral imaging planes were 47 and 31 degrees, respectively. After optimization, the average amplitude of through plane motion reduced from 3.6mm in AP images to 2.5mm (min:1.3mm, max:3.9mm); and from 1.7mm in lateral images to 0.6mm (min: 0.2mm, max:1.5mm), while the principal in plane motion amplitude increased from 5.6mm to 6.5mm (min: 2.8mm, max: 17mm).Conclusion:DIR and PCA can be used to optimize the orthogonal image planes of cineMRI to minimize the through plane motion during radiotherapy guidance.",

        "abstract": "Mesenchymal niche cells instruct activity of tissue-resident stem and progenitor cell populations. Epithelial stem cells in hair follicles (HFs) have region-specific activity, which may arise from intrinsic cellular heterogeneity within mesenchymal dermal papilla (DP) cells. Here we show that expression of Hoxc genes is sufficient to reprogram mesenchymal DP cells and alter the regenerative potential of epithelial stem cells. Hoxc gene expression in adult skin dermis closely correlates with regional HF regeneration patterns. Disrupting the region-specific expression patterns of Hoxc genes, by either decreasing their epigenetic repression via Bmi1 loss or inducing ectopic interactions of the Hoxc locus with an active epigenetic region, leads to precocious HF regeneration. We further show that a single Hoxc gene is sufficient to activate dormant DP niches and promote regional HF regeneration through canonical Wnt signaling. Altogether, these results reveal that Hoxc genes bestow mesenchymal niches with tissue-level heterogeneity and plasticity.",

        "abstract": "Changes in external light patterns can alter cell activities in peripheral tissues through slow entrainment of the central clock in suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). It remains unclear whether cells in otherwise photo-insensitive tissues can achieve rapid responses to changes in external light. Here we show that light stimulation of animals' eyes results in rapid activation of hair follicle stem cells with prominent hair regeneration. Mechanistically, light signals are interpreted by M1-type intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which signal to the SCN via melanopsin. Subsequently, efferent sympathetic nerves are immediately activated. Increased norepinephrine release in skin promotes hedgehog signaling to activate hair follicle stem cells. Thus, external light can directly regulate tissue stem cells via an ipRGC-SCN autonomic nervous system circuit. Since activation of sympathetic nerves is not limited to skin, this circuit can also facilitate rapid adaptive responses to external light in other homeostatic tissues.",

However, efficient in vivo delivery of this genome editing machinery and indeed the very feasibility of using these techniques in vivo remain challenging for most tissue types. Here, we show that nonreplicable Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoproteins can be used to correct genetic defects in skin stem cells of postnatal recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) mice. We developed a method to locally deliver Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoproteins into the skin of postnatal mice. This method results in rapid gene editing in epidermal stem cells. Using this method, we show that Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoproteins efficiently excise exon80, which covers the point mutation in our RDEB mouse model, and thus restores the correct localization of the collagen VII protein in vivo. The skin blistering phenotype is also significantly ameliorated after treatment. This study provides an in vivo gene correction strategy using ribonucleoproteins as curative treatment for genetic diseases in skin and potentially in other somatic tissues.",

        "abstract": "The clustered regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system functions like an adaptive immune system in a variety of microbes and has recently been engineered as a powerful tool for manipulating genomic sequences in a huge variety of cell types. In mammals, CRISPR/Cas9 has the potential to bring curative therapies to patients with genetic diseases, although it remained unknown whether suitable in vivo methods for its use are feasible. It is now appreciated that the efficient delivery of these genome-editing tools into most tissue types, including skin, remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a detailed protocol for performing in vivo gene editing of genomic sequences in mouse skin stem cells using Cas9/sgRNAs ribonucleoproteins in combination with electrotransfer technology. We here present all of the required methods needed for the protocol, including molecular cloning, in vitro sgRNA expression and sgRNA purification, Cas9 protein purification, and in vivo delivery of cas9 ribonucleoproteins. This protocol provides a novel in vivo gene editing strategy using ribonucleoproteins for skin stem cells and can potentially be used as curative treatment for genetic diseases in skin and other somatic tissues.",

        "abstract": "As promising supports, reducible metal oxides afford strong metal-support interactions to achieve efficient catalysis, relying on their band states and surface stoichiometry. Herein, in-situ and controlled hydrogen doping (H-doping) via H2 spillover is employed to engineer the metal-support interactions in hydrogenated MoOx supported Ir (Ir/H-MoOx) catalysts, and thus promote furfural hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol. Via facilely varying reduction temperature, the resulting H-doping in a controlled manner tailors low-valence Mo species (Mo5+ and Mo4+) on H-MoOx supports, and thus charge-redistribution on Ir and H-MoOx interfaces. This further leads to obvious difference in H2 chemisorption on Ir, showing the promise for catalytic hydrogenation. As expected, the optimal Ir/H-MoOx with controlled H-doping affords high activity (TOF: 4.62 min-1) and selectivity (> 99%) in furfural hydrogenation at a mild condition (T = 30 oC, PH2 = 2 MPa), performing among the best of current catalysts.",

Herein, surface decoration by FeOx is introduced to remarkably improve the selectivity of cinnamyl alcohol (COL) in cinnamaldehyde (CAL) hydrogenation on Pt/MoO3-y. The enhanced acidity on Pt-FeOx interfaces is beneficial for the chemisorption and activation of C=O bonds, promoting selective hydrogenation. The optimal catalysts with defined FeOx decoration afford efficient and chemoselective CAL hydrogenation (sel.: 91.3%) under a mild condition (PH2 = 1 MPa, T = 30 oC). Moreover, such innovation is further extended to develop other efficient metal (Ir, Rh and Pd) catalysts, identifying a universal promotion to Pt-group metals. This work is anticipated to inspire the rational design of high-performance catalysts via effective surface/interface engineering.",

        "abstract": "In heterogeneous catalysis, strong metal-support interactions are highly desired to improve catalytic turnover on metal catalysts. Herein, uniform molybdenum-incorporation is introduced into mesoporous silica (KIT-6) to accomplish the strong interactions with iridium catalysts, and consequently the active and selective hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds. The Mo-incorporated KIT-6 (Mo-KIT-6) affords electronic interactions to improve the proportion of metallic Ir0 species, avoiding the easy surface oxidation of ultrafine metals in silica meso-cavities. Owing to the effective H2 activation and following hydrogenation on metallic Ir0 sites, the optimal Ir/Mo-KIT-6 with a high Ir0/Ir\u03b4+ ratio delivers prominent performance in the hydrogenation of amides to amines and \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols. As for N-acetylmorpholine hydrogenation, the Ir/Mo-KIT-6 achieves efficient turnover toward N-ethylmorpholine with a high selectivity (> 99%), and demonstrates the activity relying on the engineered chemical state of Ir sites. Such promotion is further proved universal in cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation. This work will provide new opportunities for catalyst design through surface/interface engineering.",

Achieving the modification of their magnetism is desirable for device applications. In our work, structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of the Fe adsorbed GaSe monolayer are studied systematically using density functional theory (DFT). It is found that there is a strong orbit coupling effect between Fe and the vicinal Ga and Se atoms, resulting in a half-metallicity with a 100% spin polarization. The magnetic moments of the nearest neighbour Ga and Se atoms are \u22120.004 \u03bcB and \u22120.178 \u03bcB, respectively, demonstrating an antiferromagnetic coupling with the adsorbed Fe atom. Meanwhile, the induced majority and minority spin states are inclined to distribute on the Se and Ga atoms separately. The hybridization of Fe-3d, Se-4p, and Ga-4p orbitals is responsible for the induced magnetic moments and spin polarization in the nonmagnetic GaSe monolayer. These investigations shed light on understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic/GaSe adsorption system, which offer some references for the design and construction of two-dimensional spin nanostructures.",

The results showed that field emission performance was strongly affected by nanowire morphology, and the nanotower-like ZnO exhibited the lowest turn-on field of 4.36\u202fV/\u03bcm. The classical F-N theory was employed to analyze the enhancement mechanism.

        "abstract": "The perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of Fe1\u2212x Co x  thin films on MgO(001) was investigated via first-principles density-functional calculations. Four different configurations were considered based on their ground states: Fe/MgO, Fe12Co4/MgO, Fe10Co6/MgO, and Fe8Co8/MgO. As the Co composition increases, the amplitude of PMA increases first from Fe/MgO to Fe12Co4/MgO, and then decreases in Fe10Co6/MgO; finally, the magnetic anisotropy becomes horizontal in Fe8Co8/MgO. Analysis based on the second-order perturbation of the spin-orbit interaction was carried out to illustrate the contributions from Fe and Co atoms to PMA, and the differential charge density was calculated to give an intuitive comparison of 3d orbital occupancy. The enhanced PMA in Fe12Co4/MgO is ascribed to the optimized combination of occupied and unoccupied 3d states around the Fermi energy from both interface Fe and Co atoms, while the weaker PMA in Fe10Co6/MgO is mainly attributed to the modulation of the interface Co-d  xy  orbital around the Fermi energy. By adjusting the Co composition in Fe1\u2212x Co x , the density of states of transitional metal atoms will be modulated to optimize PMA for future high-density memory application.",

In the present work, the interfacial behavior of the GO nanosheet at the crude oil/water interface was explored to investigate its demulsification mechanism for crude oil/water emulsions. The interfacial rheology properties and the interfacial tension were systematically discussed. The results revealed that GO was able to decrease the interfacial tension of the emulsion to a large extent, implying that the GO nanosheet was interfacially active. Unexpectedly, the dilational modulus monotonically increased with increasing the GO dosage. In addition, the coalescence kinetics and the interfacial assembly behaviors of GO were investigated. It was observed that the oil droplet became wrinkled once contacting with the crude oil/water interface, and a thin film was finally left at the interface. Therefore, the GO nanosheet was thought to be able to diffuse to the oil/water interface and self-...",

Understanding the adsorption behaviors of GO at the oil\u2013water interface has become increasingly important both in terms of fundamental science and applications of GO in emulsions. In the present work, the adsorption dynamics of GO sheets at the toluene/water interface were explored by using pendant drop tensiometry to trace the evolution of oil/water interfacial tensions. A shift from diffusion-controlled to kinetic controlled feature was observed during the aging of the interface, indicating the irreversible adsorption of GO to the interface. Assembly of GO at oil/water interfaces in the presence of surfactants were discussed. Robust large-area films could be prepared by taking advantage of the assembly of GO at the oil/water interface in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and octane phenol polyoxyethylene-10. Corresponding interaction mechanisms were discussed. Ultimately, the acquired insights on the interfacial adsorption and the interfacial assembly behavior of GO sheets were combined to reveal the demulsification performance of GO for different emulsions. The findings in the present study are crucial for fully understanding the interfacial activity of GO in emulsions and might provide a facile way to prepare large-area graphene oxide thin films.",

The as-prepared magnetic demulsifier was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The magnetic demulsifier showed excellent demulsification performance for water in crude oil emulsion. The demulsification process was revealed by using confocal microscope. Besides, the used magnetic demulsifier could be readily recycled by magnetic separation and solvent washing, and it presented excellent demulsification performance within 3 cycles.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Hierarchically engineered asymmetric ceramic membrane is successfully fabricated, and special wettability is endowed to the membrane by introducing superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic silica nanoparticles through dip-coating technology onto the active separation layer. Effect of reaction temperature on the wettability of the silica nanoparticles is discussed. It has been found that the hydrophilicity of the silica increases with increasing the temperature and superhydrophilicity can be obtained when the temperature reaches to 60\u00a0\u00b0C. Underwater oil contact measurements are performed using a series of oils and it turns out the as-prepared material bear excellent oil repellency towards various oil droplets. Separation performance of the membrane for oily wastewater treatment was investigated. It has been revealed that the as-prepared membrane can successfully separate the oil contaminated wastewater within one step under a small applied pressure (0.1\u00a0MPa) with oil rejection coefficient  R u003e99.95%, indicating an extremely high separation efficiency.",

The resultant membranes have controllable thicknesses from 49 nm to several micrometers and tunable pore sizes ranging from 8 to 14 nm. These membranes exhibited extremely high permeation flux and displayed excellent separation efficiency for various molecules including proteins, nanoparticles and dyes. The 49 nm thick membrane, for instance, has a pure water flux of up to 13\u2006888 L m\u22122 h\u22121 bar\u22121, which was almost three orders of magnitude higher than those of most commercial filtration membranes, while retaining a 95% rejection of bovine serum albumin. More importantly, the membranes exhibit outstanding selective transport performance for various dye mixtures.

        "abstract": "Most conventional heterogeneous network selection strategies applied in heterogeneous vehicular network regard the performance of each network constant in various traffic scenarios. This assumption leads such strategies to be ineffective in the real-world performance-changing scenarios. To solve this problem, we propose an optimal game approach for heterogeneous vehicular network selection under conditions in which the performance parameters of some networks are changing. Terminals attempting to switch to the network with higher evaluation is formulated as a multi-play non-cooperative game. Heterogeneous vehicular network characteristics are thoroughly accounted for to adjust the game strategy and adapt to the vehicular environment for stability and rapid convergence. A multi-play non-cooperative game model is built to formulate network selection. A probabilistic strategy is used to gradually drive players toward convergence to prevent instability. Furthermore, a system prototype was built at the Connected and Automated Vehicle Test bed of Chang?an University (CAVTest). Its corresponding test results indicate that the proposed approach can effectively suppress the ping-pong effect caused by massive handoffs due to varying network performance and thus well outperforms the single-play strategy.",

        "abstract": "Texture feature description is a remarkable challenge in the fields of computer vision and pattern recognition. Since the traditional texture feature description method, the local binary pattern (LBP), is unable to acquire more detailed direction information and always sensitive to noise, we propose a novel method based on generalized Gabor direction pattern (GGDP) and weighted discrepancy measurement model (WDMM) to overcome those defects. Firstly, a novel patch-structure direction pattern (PDP) is proposed, which can extract rich feature information and be insensitive to noise. Then, motivated by searching for a description method that can explore richer and more discriminant texture features and reducing the local Gabor feature vector\u2019s high dimension problem, we extend PDP to form the GGDP method with multi-channel Gabor space. Furthermore, WDMM, which can effectively measure the feature distance between two images, is presented for the classification and recognition of image samples.

        "abstract": "Image feature representation is a hot topic in the computer vision field. Inspired by Weber's law and local graph structure (LGS), we propose a novel image feature representation descriptor, called orthogonal symmetric local weber graph structure (OSLWGS). It contains two components: differential excitation pattern (DEP) and orthogonal symmetric LGS (OSLGS). In particular, DEP is extended by bringing difference of Gaussian (DoG), which can make OSLWGS robust to image noise. In addition, OSLGS can overcome some defects of LGS including non-symmetric and single horizontal structure problems. Furthermore, 2D OSLWGS histogram is generated by fusing DEP and OSLGS to improve the discriminative power and obtain more precise image description. And then, it is further encoded into 1D histogram and classified via sparse representation. Extensive experiments on FERET, CMUPIE, LFW, Yale B, simulated YALE partial occlusion, RawFooT and PhoTex databases validate the effectiveness of the proposed OSLWGS. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is an efficient and robust method compared with some state-of-the-art approaches.",

Image representation under complex illumination condition is a great challenge in computer vision field. Motivated by Weber law and synergistic center-surround receipt field model, we propose an illumination-insensitive feature descriptor, named as Weber synergistic center-surround pattern (WSCP), including three components: differential synergistic excitation pattern (DSEP), synergistic straight orientation pattern (SSOP) and synergistic diagonal orientation pattern (SDOP). To further enhance the discriminative power of WSCP, we present a scale and orientation weighted WSCP (WWSCP), which fully considers the inner and outer layer pixels excitation distributions, as well as their orientation information importance. To acquire more discriminative and rich features, we utilize the spatiograms to describe patterns instead of the conventional histograms, which can obtain higher order spatial information. In the final classification stage, we present a novel distance measurement model called weighted similarity measurement model (WSMM) to improve classification accuracy, by sufficiently utilizing the information contents and orientation distributions of each pattern. Extensive experimental comparisons between our methods and other state-of-the-art methods are conducted on CMUPIE, YALE B, YALE B Ext, FERET, PhoTex, Alot and RawFooT databases, and performance results have verified the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methods on the robustness to illumination variations.",

However, the task of generating excited states with long lifetimes has been met with limited success, owing to the ultrafast deactivation of the highly active excited states. Here, we present a design rule that can be used to tune the emission lifetime of a wide range of luminescent organic molecules, based on effective stabilization of triplet excited states through strong coupling in H-aggregated molecules. Our experimental data revealed that luminescence lifetimes up to 1.35 s, which are several orders of magnitude longer than those of conventional organic fluorophores, can be realized under ambient conditions. These results outline a fundamental principle to design organic molecules with extended lifetimes of excited states, providing a major step forward in expanding the scope of organic phosphorescence applications.",

The low triplet exciton formation is realized by small triplet exciton formation fraction and rate with high binding energy and high reorganization energy of triplet exciton. Demonstrated in two analogue molecules in conventional donor\u2013acceptor molecule structure for bipolar charge injection and transport with nearly the same frontier orbital energy levels and triplet excited energies, the new concept host material shows significantly suppressed triplet exciton formation in the host to avoid quenching effects, leading to much improved device efficiencies and stabilities.

        "abstract": "Phenolic acids are widely distributed in the plant kingdom and possess a broad spectrum of pharmacological activity. However, low oral bioavailability restricts their application. In this study, a high dispersed phyto- phospholipid complex with mesoporous silica containing TPGS 1000 (TPC-SD) was fabricated using Tanshinol (Tan) as model drug. Phospholipid complex (PC) was employed to improve the n-octanol/water partition coefficient (log P) and apparent permeability coefficients (P) of Tan. Mesoporous silica was used to compensate for the negative effects of phospholipid on drug's dispersion and dissolution owing to its viscosity and poor water-solubility. TPGS 1000, a P-gp inhibitor, was used to block the efflux of Tan. Log P tests showed that the lipophilicity of Tan was significantly enhanced by Tanshinol phospholipid complex (TPC) formation. In vitro dissolution results showed that the cumulative dissolution percentage of Tan from TPC-SD was 4.33- fold of that from TPC in 120\u202fmin\u202fA Caco-2 permeability test confirmed that P (AP-BL) of TPC and TPC-SD increased approximately 2.22- and 3.53- fold compared to those of unformulated Tan, respectively (p < 0.01, p < 0.01). Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the AUC of TPC-SD was 2.23- and 1.47- fold compared with those of unformulated Tan and TPC, respectively (p < 0.01, p < 0.01). These results indicated that the high dispersed phyto- phospholipid complex/TPGS 1000 by mesoporous silica can be a promising drug delivery system to improve the oral bioavailability of free phenolic acids.",

        "abstract": "Andrographolide (ADG) is a diterpenoid isolated from  with a wide spectrum of biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anticancer and hepatoprotective effects. However, its poor water solubility and efflux by P-glycoprotein have resulted in lower bioavailability. In this study, ADG nanosuspensions (ADG-NS) were prepared using a wet media milling technique followed by freeze drying. d-\u03b1-Tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS), a surfactant that inhibits P-glycoprotein function, and sodium lauryl sulfate were used as surface stabilizers. A Box-Behnken design was used to optimize the nanosuspension preparation. The products of these optimal preparation conditions were amorphous and possessed much faster dissolution in vitro than a coarse powder of ADG. The particle size and redispersibility index of the freeze-dried ADG-NS were 244.6\u00b13.0 nm and 113%\u00b11.14% (n=3), respectively. A short-term stability study indicated that the freeze-dried ADG-NS could remain highly stable as nanosuspensions during the testing period. A test of transport across a Caco-2 cell monolayer revealed that the membrane permeability () of ADG-NS was significantly higher than the permeability of the ADG coarse powder or ADG-NS without TPGS (<0.01). Compared to the ADG coarse powder, a physical mixture, commercial dripping pills and ADG-NS without TPGS, ADG-NS exhibited significantly higher plasma exposure with significant enhancements in  and area under the curve of plasma concentration versus time from zero to the last sampling time (AUC ) (<0.01). An evaluation of the anti-inflammatory effect on Carr-induced paw edema demonstrated that the ADG-NS were more effective in reducing the rate of paw swelling, producing a greater increase in the serum levels of nitric oxide (NO), Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) (<0.01) and an increase in superoxide dismutase activity (<0.05) compared to the ADG coarse powder. This study indicated that nanosuspensions could act as an effective delivery device for ADG to enhance its oral bioavailability and biological efficacy.",

        "abstract": "This work aimed to improve membrane permeability as well as in vitro dissolution rate and thus enhance oral bioavailability for a BCS IV class plant drug by constructing a combined drug delivery system (CDDS) composed of a phospholipid complex (PC) and an ordered mesoporous silica-based solid dispersion (SD), using tanshinone IIA (TS) as a model drug. Tanshinone IIA phospholipid complex (TS\u2013PC) and ordered mesoporous silica-based solid dispersion (TSPC-SD) were prepared using the solvent evaporation method. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy proved the formation of TS\u2013PC or TSPC-SD, and amorphous form existing in these two systems. n-Octanol/water partition coefficient (lg\u2006Po/w) tests showed that a remarkably decreased lg\u2006Po/w for TS\u2013PC was obtained compared to unformulated TS, while no increase was observed for TSPC-SD compared to TS\u2013PC. Evaluations in Caco-2 cell monolayers revealed that TS\u2013PC exhibited a significantly increased absorptive permeability (p u003c 0.05) in apparent permeability coefficients (Papp) (70.2% higher) compared to unformulated TS. Compared to that of unformulated TS, in vitro drug dissolution rate of TS from TSPC-SD significantly increased (p u003c 0.01), while that from TS\u2013PC was slightly decreased. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that TSPC-SD had 2.19-fold higher AUC0\u2013t compared to unformulated TS (p u003c 0.01). The remarkable improvements in bioavailability with the use of TSPC-SD may result from comprehensive effects, including improved lg\u2006Po/w and Pappvia PC, and increased dissolution rates from SD. These results indicated that the CDDS can be promising for enhancing the oral bioavailability of BCS IV class drugs.",

In this study, we characterized the estrogenic activity of SM using  models of immature and ovariectomized (OVX) mice and performed  studies focusing on the estrogen receptor (ER) pathway for further molecular characterizations. SM treatments demonstrated significant estrogenic activity by promoting the development of uterus and vagina in immature mice, restoring the estrus cycle and reversing the atrophy of reproductive tissues in OVX mice, as well as increasing the expressions of ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 at protein and mRNA level in the reproductive tissues. Meanwhile, SM significantly increased estradiol in serum, and decreased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) in the circulation of immature and OVX mice. SM could stimulate the binding effect of ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2, and significantly induce ER\u03b1/\u03b2-estrogen response element (ERE) luciferase reporter gene expression. All these activities were inhibited by the ER antagonist ICI182, 780. This study demonstrates SM exerts estrogenic effects by stimulating biosynthesis of estrogen and increasing ERs in target tissues without side effects on reproductive tissues and through ER-ERE-dependent pathway.",

Meanwhile, RPA significantly increased serum estradiol and clearly decreased serum luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone of immature/OVX mice. Moreover, RPA could induce ER positive MCF-7 cell from S-phase to G2 stage and induce proliferation and no influence on ER negative MDA-MB-231 cell. RPA could bind with ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 and significantly stimulate ER\u03b1/\u03b2-estrogen response element (ERE) luciferase reporter gene expression.

        "abstract": "Radix paeoniae alba (RPA) and Veratrum nigrum L. (VN) belong to the eighteen incompatible medicaments and have been prohibited for thousands of years in China. Previous studies focused on the chemical constituents induced the toxicological response of the two agents, but this study offers preliminary insight into the pharmacodynamics and mechanism on estrogenic activity which is responsible for their incompatibility. We undertook a characterization of the interaction on estrogenic activity of RPA and VN using in vivo models of immature and ovariectomized (OVX) mice and in vitro studies focused on estrogen receptor (ER) pathway for further mechanism. VN disturbed the estrogenic efficacy of RPA on promoting development of uterus and vagina in immature mice, and reversing the atrophy of reproductive tissues in OVX mice by decreasing the increase of serum estrogen level and upregulation estrogen receptor (ER) expression in reproductive tissues by treatment with RPA. Besides, VN antagonized the estrogenic efficacy of RPA on stimulating the binding with ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2, increasing ER\u03b1/\u03b2-estrogen response element (ERE) luciferase reporter gene expression and promoting MCF-7 cells viability. These findings provide evidence that VN inhibits RPA exerting estrogenic effects might be related to regulation of estrogen secretion and ERs, and through ER-ERE pathway.",

Triphenylphosphine and palladium nanoparticles were immobilized in situ in the polymer formed from Pd catalyzed coupling of tris(4-bromophenyl)amine and benzene-1,4-diboronic acid. The immobilized triphenylphosphine enhanced the activity and the stability of the catalyst Pd@PNP, and the catalyst Pd@PNP can be reused at least 5 times with good activity. Functional groups, such as methoxyl, nitrile, tert-butyl, nitro, acyl and formyl groups, were well tolerated under the reaction conditions, and the corresponding products were obtained in high yields.",

In prior studies, longer sleep duration is associated with lower BP, and SGA is associated with shorter sleep duration in childhood. We investigated whether sleep duration in early childhood modifies the association between SGA and higher childhood SBP in 1178 children recruited at birth and followed up to age 9 years. We ascertained birthweight and gestational age from medical records. We derived child sleep duration from maternal questionnaire interview. We calculated child SBP percentile according to U.S. reference data. We defined elevated SBP as SBP \u226575 percentile. In this sample, 154 (13.1%) children were born SGA. Children born SGA had higher SBP percentiles and higher risk of elevated SBP. Among children born SGA, those in the highest compared to the lowest tertile for sleep had a 12.28 lower (-22.00, -2.57) SBP percentile and 0.44 (0.25 to 0.79) times lower risk of developing elevated SBP. Our data are consistent with an interaction between SGA and sleep duration on childhood elevated SBP (P\u2009=\u20090.0056). In conclusion, in this prospective birth cohort, longer sleep duration in early childhood may mitigate the blood pressure-raising effect of being born small.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This study examines the temporal and spatial distribution of magnetic properties in Holocene sediment cores taken from the subaqueous Yangtze delta, China, to evaluate depositional environmental changes including the sediment with an anthropogenic provenance and changes in the bottom-water chemistry. Our approach is to compare the magnetic properties in Holocene cores with those from a suite of surficial sediment samples taken at various locations from the Yangtze delta and the adjacent continental shelf. The results indicate that the magnetic properties in sediment cores change generally with sedimentary facies, mainly due to their in-phase changes with sediment grain size and redox conditions, but that they have also been significantly altered by effects of human activity and early diagenesis. Magnetic parameters that exhibit soil erosion associations show remarkable increases over the past \u223c800 years, reflecting an increase in the terrestrial supply of fine-grained magnetic minerals induced by the intensification of human activity in the Yangtze River catchment. Early diagenesis was strong in core HZK8, located at the depocenter of the subaqueous Yangtze delta, including dissolution of fine-grained ferrimagnetic minerals and the precipitation of authigenic greigite and pyrite, as evidenced by both room-temperature and thermo-magnetic analyses. The dissolution of ferrimagnetic minerals coincides with changes in sedimentation rate at different sites and time periods, suggesting that this factor is important for controlling the rate of early diagenesis. Authigenic iron sulfides suggest the function of sulfate-reducing bacteria, which implies a hypoxic environment at this site from \u223c6000\u00a0cal.\u00a0yr BP.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Taihu Plain of the Lower Yangtze valley, China was a centre of rice agriculture during the Neolithic period. Reasons for the rapid development of rice cultivation during this period, however, have not been fully understood for this coastal lowland, which is highly sensitive to sea-level change. To improve understanding of the geomorphological and hydrological context for evolution of prehistoric rice agriculture, two sediment cores (DTX4 and DTX10) in the East Tiaoxi River Plain, south Taihu Plain, were collected, and analysed for radiocarbon dating, diatoms, organic carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (\u03b4 13 C and \u03b4 15 N), grain size and lithology. These multiproxy analyses revealed that prior to ca. 7500\u202fcal.\u202fyr BP, the East Tiaoxi River Plain was a rapidly aggrading high-salinity estuary (the Palaeo-Taihu Estuary). After ca. 7500\u202fcal.\u202fyr BP, low salinity conditions prevailed as a result of strong Yangtze freshwater discharge. Subsequently, seawater penetration occurred and saltmarsh developed between ca. 7000 and 6500\u202fcal.\u202fyr BP due to accelerated relative sea-level rise. This transgression event influenced a large area of the Taihu Plain during the Holocene, as shown by multiple sediment records from previous studies. Persistent freshwater marsh (or subaerial land) formed due to dramatic shrinkage/closure of the Palaeo-Taihu Estuary after ca. 5600\u202fcal.\u202fyr BP when sea level was relatively stable. We speculate that geomorphological and hydrological changes of the East Tiaoxi River Plain played an important role in agricultural development across the Taihu Plain during the Neolithic period. The closure of the Palaeo-Taihu Estuary and the formation of stable freshwater marsh (or subaerial land) after ca. 5600\u202fcal.\u202fyr BP were critical preconditions encouraging the rapid rise of rice productivity in the Liangzhu period (5500\u20134500\u202fcal.\u202fyr BP). This development changed the landscape and river systems, and thus provided adequate freshwater supply to the Taihu Plain.",

Results demonstrate that coastal and estuarine deposition during OIS 5 and OIS 3 occurred throughout the study area. However, Holocene transgressive sediments were absent on the Taihu block. The burial depth of intertidal to subtidal sediment deposited during OIS 5e records 30-80m subsidence caused by sediment compaction and tectonic movement since that time. However, coastal sediments formed during the late phase of OIS 3 were buried to a depth of ca. 6-15m in the Taihu Lake area, while the burial depth increased eastward to ca. 45-60m on the coastal plain. This phenomenon, combined with the distribution of Holocene marine strata, indicates at least 25-30m uplift of the Taihu block since the end of OIS 3. We suggest that this uplift was mainly caused by the differential subsidence due to substantial amount of post-glacial deposition by the Changjiang and Huanghe Rivers on the continental shelf of east China marginal sea. \u00a9 2013 University of Washington.",

However, such trackers often run into drifting problems due to the fact that the tracking result is a bounding box which also includes background information, especially in the case of occlusion and low contrast situations. In this paper, we propose an online compressive tracking algorithm based on superpixel segmentation (SPCT). The proposed algorithm employs a weighted multi-scale random measurement matrix along with an efficient superpixel segmentation to preserve the image structure of the targets during tracking. The superpixel segmentation is used to distinguish the target from its surrounding background, to obtain the weighted features within the bounding box. Furthermore, a feedback strategy is also proposed to update the classifier model to reduce the drifting risk. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art tracking algorithms as well as the compressive trackers.",

Previous works of literature for navigation mainly lie in two categories: scene-oriented simultaneous localization and mapping and robot-oriented heading fields lane detection and trajectory tracking. Those methods face the challenges of either high computation cost or heavy labelling and calibration requirements. In this paper, we propose to formulate the spherical image navigation as an image classification problem, which significantly simplifies the orientation estimation and path prediction procedure and accelerates the navigation process. More specifically, we train an end-to-end convolutional network on our spherical image dataset with novel orientation categories labels. This trained network can give precise predictions on potential path directions with single spherical images.

        "abstract": "Feature-based matching methods have been widely used in remote sensing image matching given their capability to achieve excellent performance despite image geometric and radiometric distortions. However, most of the feature-based methods are unreliable for complex background variations, because the gradient or other image grayscale information used to construct the feature descriptor is sensitive to image background variations. Recently, deep learning-based methods have been proven suitable for high-level feature representation and comparison in image matching. Inspired by the progresses made in deep learning, a new technical framework for remote sensing image matching based on the Siamese convolutional neural network is presented in this paper. First, a Siamese-type network architecture is designed to simultaneously learn the features and the corresponding similarity metric from labeled training examples of matching and non-matching true-color patch pairs. In the proposed network, two streams of convolutional and pooling layers sharing identical weights are arranged without the manually designed features. The number of convolutional layers is determined based on the factors that affect image matching. The sigmoid function is employed to compute the matching and non-matching probabilities in the output layer. Second, a gridding sub-pixel Harris algorithm is used to obtain the accurate localization of candidate matches. Third, a Gaussian pyramid coupling quadtree is adopted to gradually narrow down the searching space of the candidate matches, and multiscale patches are compared synchronously. Subsequently, a similarity measure based on the output of the sigmoid is adopted to find the initial matches. Finally, the random sample consensus algorithm and the whole-to-local quadratic polynomial constraints are used to remove false matches. In the experiments, different types of satellite datasets, such as ZY3, GF1, IKONOS, and Google Earth images, with complex background variations are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method, which can significantly improve the matching performance of multi-temporal remote sensing images with complex background variations, is better than the state-of-the-art matching methods. In our experiments, the proposed method obtained a large number of evenly distributed matches (at least 10 times more than other methods) and achieved a high accuracy (less than 1 pixel in terms of root mean square error).",

        "abstract": "Training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is notoriously challenging. We propose and study an architectural modification, self-modulation, which improves GAN performance across different data sets, architectures, losses, regularizers, and hyperparameter settings. Intuitively, self-modulation allows the intermediate feature maps of a generator to change as a function of the input noise vector. While reminiscent of other conditioning techniques, it requires no labeled data. In a large-scale empirical study we observe a relative decrease of $5%-35%$ in FID. Furthermore, all else being equal, adding this modification to the generator leads to improved performance in $124/144$ ($86%$) of the studied settings. Self-modulation is a simple architectural change that requires no additional parameter tuning, which suggests that it can be applied readily to any GAN.",

Recently, several works have framed GAN training as an online or continual learning problem. We focus on the discriminator, which must perform classification under an (adversarially) shifting data distribution. When trained on sequential tasks, neural networks exhibit emph{forgetting}. For GANs, discriminator forgetting leads to training instability. To counter forgetting, we encourage the discriminator to maintain useful representations by adding a self-supervision. Conditional GANs have a similar effect using labels. However, our self-supervised GAN does not require labels, and closes the performance gap between conditional and unconditional models. We show that, in doing so, the self-supervised discriminator learns better representations than regular GANs.",

        "abstract": "FRM-36143 possesses all the characteristics of a GSM in terms of A\u03b2 modulation Because FRM-36143 was able to reverse the effect of PS mutations, we suggest that targeting patients with this genetic defect would be the best approach at testing the efficacy of a GSM in the clinic. While the amyloid hypothesis is still being tested with \u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies in sporadic AD, we believe it is not a hypothesis for FAD. Since GSMs can correct the molecular defect caused by PS mutations, they have the promise to provide benefits to the patients when treated early enough in the course of the disease.",

        "abstract": "Pharmacological activation of \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (\u03b17 nAChRs) may improve cognition in schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. The present studies describe an integrated pharmacological analysis of the effects of FRM-17874, an analogue of encenicline, on \u03b17 nAChRs in vitro and in behavioral and neurophysiological assays relevant to cognitive function. FRM-17874 demonstrated high affinity binding to human \u03b17 nAChRs, displacing [(3)H]-methyllacaconitine (Ki=4.3nM). In Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing human \u03b17 nAChRs, FRM-17874 acted as an agonist, evoking inward currents with an EC50 of 0.42\u03bcM. Lower concentrations of FRM-17874 (0.01-3nM) elicited no detectable current, but primed receptors to respond to sub-maximal concentrations of acetylcholine. FRM-17874 improved novel object recognition in rats, and enhanced memory acquisition and reversal learning in the mouse water T-maze. Neurophysiological correlates of cognitive effects of drug treatment, such as synaptic transmission, long-term potentiation, and hippocampal theta oscillation were also evaluated. Modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity was observed in rat hippocampal slices at concentrations of 3.2 and 5nM. FRM-17874 showed a dose-dependent facilitation of stimulation-induced hippocampal theta oscillation in mice and rats. The FRM-17874 unbound brain concentration-response relationship for increased theta oscillation power was similar in both species, exhibited a biphasic pattern peaking around 3nM, and overlapped with active doses and exposures observed in cognition assays. In summary, behavioral and neurophysiological assays indicate a bell-shaped effective concentration range and this report represents the first attempt to explain the concentration-response function of \u03b17 nAChR-mediated pro-cognitive effects in terms of receptor pharmacology.

        "abstract": "Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) is a rare monogenic disorder presenting as uncontrolled hyperglycemia during the first 6\u00a0months of life. Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) is quite rare in NDM patients, and reported experience with this condition is limited. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is frequently used as a mode of dialytic treatment in critically ill patients with acute renal failure, but has seldom been used in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and HHS. We report the case of a 2-month-old infant admitted to our hospital presenting with dyspnea and lethargy. Blood gas showed severe hyperosmotic DKA. After 21\u00a0h of fluid and insulin therapy, the baby presented with increased drowsiness and irregular respiration, which suggested cerebral edema. Moreover, the DKA and HHS were exacerbated. After 18\u00a0h of CRRT, the patient gradually recovered from DKA and HHS. The gene analysis revealed a de novo mutation (c.602G\u2009>\u2009A (p.R201H)) of the KCNJ11 gene, and oral glibenclamide successfully replaced insulin treatment in the patient.",

        "abstract": "Progranulin (PGRN), a novel peptide that has recently emerged as an important regulatory adipokine, is relevant to energy homeostasis and obesity in animals and adult humans. Little is known about its roles in children. The aim of the current study was to determine the potential role of PGRN and explore its relationship to various obesity-related markers in obese children. This was a cross-sectional study composed of 77 children (43 obese and 34 healthy, age 8.68\u2009\u00b1\u20090.28 and 8.46\u2009\u00b1\u20090.45 years, resp.). The PGRN levels were significantly higher in obese children (102.44\u2009\u00b1\u20094.18\u2009ng/mL) comparing to controls (69.32\u2009\u00b1\u20095.49\u2009ng/mL) ( < 0.05). Moreover, the PGRN levels were positively correlated with triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), IL-6, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in obese children after adjusted for BMI and age. However, there was no correlation of serum PGRN levels with OGTT-derived dynamic parameters, HOMA-IR, or HOMA- in obese children. The results suggest that serum PGRN levels are significantly higher in obese children in China and correlate significantly with obesity-related markers. Increased PGRN levels may be involved in the pathological mechanism of childhood obesity.",

SMARD1 is caused by loss-of-function mutations in IGHMBP2 gene. In this article, we report a male SMARD1 patient with two compound heterozygous mutations (NM_002180.2: c.688C\u202f>\u202fG; p.(Gln230Glu)) and (NM_002180.2: c.1737C\u202f>\u202fA; p.(Phe579Leu)), one of which (c.688C\u202f>\u202fG; ClinVar accession: SUB3344743: SCV000612189) is novel. He suffered from diaphragmatic palsy and distal muscular weakness from 6 months of age. His lower limbs were at first in hypertonia, and then gradually progressed into hypotonia. More interestingly, bronchoscopy has shown the diffuse tracheobronchomalacia, which had been reported only once in a SMARD1 patient who also had the same mutation (c.1737C\u202f>\u202fA) as our patient. We constructed the model of IGHMBP2 and mapped both mutations in the structure to analyze the structural impact of both mutations (c.688C\u202f>\u202fG and c.1737C\u202f>\u202fA) on the IGHMBP2 protein, which showed that mutation c.688C\u202f>\u202fG reduces greatly the stability of domain 1A of IGHMBP2, while the structural impact of c.1737C\u202f>\u202fA is not extensive.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response caused by infection or injury, is still one of the most important causes of death in clinical patients. The ongoing search for the pathogenesis of sepsis and novel therapeutic methods are highly urgent. In this study, we hypothesized that KPT330, a potent and specific small molecule inhibitor of CRM1, could reduce inflammation and attenuate the severity of sepsis. In LPS-induced sepsis model in\u00a0vivo, administration of KPT330 increased survival rate and ameliorated LPS-induced lung injury, with suppressed levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and HMGB1 in the circulation and decreased macrophage and PMN subpopulations in peritoneal cavity. In\u00a0vitro investigations showed that KPT330 dose-dependently inhibited LPS-triggered proinflammatory cytokines production including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and HMGB1 in macrophages. Furthermore, KPT330 treatment significantly suppressed TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 mRNA expression and inhibited HMGB1 necleocytoplasmic translocation by inhibiting CRM1 distribution. Moreover, the mechanism analysis demonstrated that KPT330 exerted anti-inflammation effects by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines through suppressing activation of NF-\u03baB and p38 signaling. Thus, pharmacologic stimulation of KPT330 may present a promising therapeutic strategy for sepsis.",

These compounds are formulated as [MnL(4,4'-bpy)(H2O)]n\u00b7nCH3CN (1), [MnL(bpe)0.5(DMF)]n\u00b72nH2O (2), and [MnL(bpa)(H2O)]n\u00b72nH2O (3) (L = dimethylthio-tetrathiafulvalene-bicarboxylate, 4,4'-bpy = 4,4'-bipyridine, bpe = 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethene, bpa = 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane). The X-ray single-crystal diffractions show that complexes 1-3 are all two-dimensional (2-D) coordination polymers with different frameworks in crystal lattices. Charge-transfer (CT) interactions within these MOFs are visually apparent in colors and vary according to the conjugated states of the bipyridine ligands (4,4'-bpy, bpe, and bpa). Theoretical calculations show that the charge transfer occurs from ligand L to bipyridine. The intensity of the LLCT is in the order of 2 > 1 > 3 investigated by theoretical calculations and ESR, which indicates that the intensity of CT is related to the bipyridyl conjugated state. Photocurrent responses of these compounds are consequently studied, and the results are in agreement with the intensity of charge transfer and linearly related to the LLCT energy. ",

Complexes 1 and 2 are isostructural 2-D polymers, and 3 features an unusual 3-D metal-organic framework (MOF). The 3-D MOF is constructed from tetranuclear cluster nodes built through the \u03bc-O bridge of the TTF ligand, which is first found for TTF coordination polymers. It is found that the channel generated by the 3-D MOF exerts a confinement effect on the formation of TTF dimers. The TTF dimers show strong intradimer interaction with partial electron transfer or charge transfer, and hence, the Cd compound 3 has relatively good photocurrent response property in comparison with that of 2-D Cd compound 2.",

        "abstract": "Viologen dication derivatives with a series of alkyl chains are used to assemble charge-transfer salts and films with dimethylthio-tetrathiafulvalene-bicarboxylate which aims to explore the relationship of the alkyl chain length to molecular structures and film morphologies which are important points for the design of molecular materials and manipulation of molecular devices. Four charge-transfer salts generally formulated as [(CnV)(HL)2] [n = 4(1), 8(2), 12(3) and 16(4)] are prepared and 1\u20133 are characterized by single-crystal X-ray structural analysis. In the short alkyl chain compound, TTF and C4V moieties are regularly arranged and effectively stacked with strong charge-transfer interactions. Lengthening the alkyl chain of the bipyridinium cation reduces the regular and close arrangement of the cations and anions in the crystals, which weakens the charge-transfer interaction while increasing the amphiphilic assembly of the films. Their film morphologies change from crystals to fused crystals, band-like structures and finally to smooth films with the increase of the alkyl chain length. The effects of alkyl chain length on photocurrent intensity are different between the crystal sample-modified electrodes (in the order of 1 u003e 2 u003e 3 = 4) and the film-modified electrodes (in the order of 2 u003e 1 = 3 u003e 4), because both inter-ion interactions and film-forming properties should be considered for the film electrodes. This is a systematic study of the effect of alkyl chain substitution on film morphologies in terms of crystal structures.",

The three bipyridiniums allow the exploration of the effect of different conjugated systems on molecular packing and charge-transfer interactions. A type of \u2013DDDD\u2013 stacking column with edge-to-edge short D\u22efA\u22efD contacts is found in MV compound 1, while in \u03c0-extended MeBpe compound 2, a \u2013DADDAD\u2013 type of stacking column with face-to-face short D\u22efD and A\u22efD stacking is formed, which shows the most effective cation\u2013anion interaction. No effective interaction is found for the non-conjugated MeBpa compound 3. The charge-transfer from an anion to a cation measured by UV-vis, CV and ESR is in the order of 2 u003e 1 \u226b 3, which is greatly in accordance with the order of the cationu0027s conjugated state and CT interaction.

Aiming to improve the estimation accuracy of the existing recursive EFOP (REFOP) algorithm in the case of weak input signal, this paper proposes a novel REFOP estimate algorithm by modifying the recursive form of the weighted matrix. To improve the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, the technique of reduced-order matrix approximation is employed to alleviate the increased computation burden caused by the modification. The extensive simulations show that compared with the existing REFOP algorithm, the proposed one can perform faster and more precise parameters estimation whether the input signal is weak or not, which verifies its effectiveness and superiority sufficiently.",

        "abstract": "Background Detecting normal-sized metastatic pelvic lymph nodes (LNs) in cervical cancers, although difficult, is of vital importance. Purpose To investigate the value of diffusion-weighted-imaging (DWI), tumor size, and LN shape in predicting metastases in normal-sized pelvic LNs in cervical cancers. Material and Methods Pathology confirmed cervical cancer patients with complete magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were documented from 2011 to 2016. A total of 121 cervical cancer patients showed small pelvic LNs (<5\u2009mm) and 92 showed normal-sized (5-10\u2009mm) pelvic LNs (39 patients with 55 nodes that were histologically metastatic, 53 patients with 71 nodes that were histologically benign). Preoperative clinical and MRI variables were analyzed and compared between the metastatic and benign groups. Results LN apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and short-to-long axis ratios were not significantly different between metastatic and benign normal-sized LNs (0.98\u2009\u00b1\u20090.15\u2009\u00d7\u200910 vs. 1.00\u2009\u00b1\u20090.18\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009mm/s, P\u2009=\u20090.45; 0.65\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16 vs. 0.64\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16, P\u2009=\u20090.60, respectively). Tumor ADC value of the metastatic LNs was significantly lower than the benign LNs (0.98\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12\u2009\u00d7\u200910 vs. 1.07\u2009\u00b1\u20090.21\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009mm/s, P\u2009=\u20090.01). Tumor size (height) was significantly higher in the metastatic LN group (27.59\u2009\u00b1\u20099.18\u2009mm vs. 21.36\u2009\u00b1\u200910.40\u2009mm, P\u2009<\u20090.00). Spiculated border rate was higher in the metastatic LN group (9 [16.4%] vs. 3 [4.2%], P\u2009=\u20090.03). Tumor (height) combined with tumor ADC value showed the highest area under the curve of 0.702 ( P\u2009<\u20090.00) in detecting metastatic pelvic nodes, with a sensitivity of 59.1% and specificity of 78.8%. Conclusions Tumor DWI combined with tumor height were superior to LN DWI and shape in predicting the metastatic state of normal-sized pelvic LNs in cervical cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "Instances of obesity and related metabolic abnormalities are increasing across the world. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common disorder in obese people and is becoming the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma. Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proven to play remarkable roles in numerous biological processes and human diseases, including NAFLD. However, the function of lncRNA in NAFLD pathogenesis remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the lncRNA expression profile in NAFLD mice and to identify novel lncRNAs involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. We performed microarray analysis to compare the expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs in the liver of diabetic db/db mice with NAFLD and normal mice. A total of 3360 lncRNAs (2048 up-regulated and 1312 down-regulated) and 2685 mRNAs (1195 up-regulated and 1490 down-regulated) were found to be differentially expressed between the NAFLD and control groups. Real-time PCR validation of five differentially expressed lncRNAs in the liver samples was consistent with the microarray results. Besides, the up-regulated lncRNA, AK012226, was also significantly increased in an NCTC1469 NAFLD cellular model. Thus, the up-regulated lncRNA, AK012226, was chosen for subsequent studies. A co-expression network of AK012226-mRNAs was constructed and bioinformatic analysis of these co-expressed mRNAs indicated that they were enriched in the PPAR signaling pathway. Furthermore, Nile red staining and flow cytometry analysis revealed that knockdown of AK012226 by siRNA significantly reduced the lipid accumulation in the NCTC1469 cells treated with free fatty acids. In conclusion, the present study identifies the dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs involved in NAFLD, and in particular, a novel lncRNA, AK012226, was identified to be associated with lipid accumulation in NAFLD.",

In this study, we aim to investigate the inhibitory effect of TIG3 on the growth of liver cancer and explore its underlying mechanism. Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Hep3B cells were transfected with plasmid GV141 carrying full-length TIG3 complementary DNA (cDNA). The effects of TIG3 on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration were determined in vitro. The suppressor effect of TIG3 on tumor growth was evaluated in vivo in a nude mouse HCC model. We observed that TIG3 expression is decreased in the Hep3B cell line as well as primary HCC tumors, and TIG3 expression inversely correlates with Ki-67 expression. Overexpression of TIG3 suppresses tumor growth in HCC both in vitro and in vivo via ERK1/2 inhibition by promoting apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation and migration. These findings identify TIG3 as an attractive therapeutic target for HCC. ",

        "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in liver carcinogenesis. We previously showed that the induction of lncRNA-uc002mbe.2 is positively associated with the apoptotic effect of trichostatin A (TSA) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. The current study further analyzed the role of uc002mbe.2 in TSA-induced liver cancer cell death. The level of uc002mbe.2 was markedly increased by TSA in the cytoplasm of HCC cells. Knockdown of uc002mbe.2 prohibited TSA-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest, p21 induction, and apoptosis of Huh7 cells and reversed the TSA-mediated decrease in p-AKT. RNA pull-down and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays revealed that TSA induced an interaction between uc002mbe.2 and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2B1 (hnRNPA2B1) in Huh7 cells. This interaction mediated AKT deactivation and p21 induction in liver cancer cells. In an athymic xenograft mouse model, knockdown of uc002mbe.2 significantly prohibited the TSA-mediated reduction in tumor size and weight. In addition, the ability of TSA to reduce hnRNPA2B1 and p-AKT levels and induce p21 in the xenograft tumors was prevented by uc002mbe.2 knockdown. Therefore, the interaction of uc002mbe.2 and hnRNPA2B1 in mediating AKT deactivation and p21 induction is involved in the cytostatic effect of trichostatin in liver cancer cells.",

A complete understanding of cellular processes is impossible without knowing the structure-function relationship of participating RNA molecules that ultimately requires large quantities of pure RNAs. Thus, structural/functional analyses of emerging RNAs necessitate revised protocols for improved RNA quantity and quality. Here we present a modified in vitro transcription protocol to enhance ribozyme cleaving efficiency and RNA yield by working on two variables, i.e., incubation temperature and limiting GTPs. Following an improved RNA synthesis, the target RNA is purified from transcription mixture components through denaturing size-exclusion chromatography. The protocol confirms that cyclic elevated incubation temperatures during transcription and increased concentrations of GTPs improve the production rate of RNA. Our modified in vitro transcription method improves the ribozyme cleaving efficiency and targets RNA yield by four- to fivefold that can benefit almost any RNA-related study from protein-RNA interaction analysis to crystallography.",

Understanding how pRNA interacts with gp16 under packaging conditions can shed light on the molecular mechanism of the packaging motor. Here, we present 3D models of the pRNA-gp16 complex and its conformation change in response to ATP or ADP binding. Using a combination of crystallography, small angle X-ray scattering and chemical probing, we find that the pRNA and gp16 forms a 'Z'-shaped complex, with gp16 specifically binds to pRNA domain II. The whole complex closes in the presence of ATP, and pRNA domain II rotates open as ATP hydrolyzes, before resetting after ADP is released. Our results suggest that pRNA domain II actively participates in the packaging process.",

Moreover, \u03c9-3 PUFAs promote phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention of YAP and this effect was mediated by MST1/2 and LATS1, suggesting that the canonical Hippo Pathway is involved in \u03c9-3 PUFAs function. We further confirmed that increase of pYAP by \u03c9-3 PUFAs was mediated by GPRs, including GPR40 and GPR120, which subsequently activate PKA via G\u03b1s, thus inducing the Hippo pathway activation. These data provide a novel DHA/EPA-GPR40/120-G\u03b1s-PKA-MST1/2-LATS1-YAP signaling pathway which is linked to \u03c9-3 PUFAs-induced inhibition of cell proliferation and promotion of apoptosis in CRC cells, indicating a mechanism that could explain the anti-cancer action of \u03c9-3 PUFAs.",

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are involved in numerous pathological processes; however, very few ncRNAs have been identified to be correlated with OLF. Here we compared the expression of lncRNA, mRNA, circRNA, and microRNA in OLF tissues from OLF patients and healthy volunteers through mRNA, lncRNA, and circRNA microarrays and microRNA sequencing. A total of 2,054 mRNAs, 2,567 lncRNAs, 627 circRNAs, and 28 microRNAs (miRNAs) were altered during the process of OLF. qPCR confirmed the differential expression of selected mRNAs and ncRNAs. An lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network, miRNA-mRNA target prediction network, and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network of circRNA-miRNA-mRNA were constructed based on a correlation analysis of the differentially expressed RNA transcripts. Subsequently, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses for the differentially expressed mRNAs and the predicted miRNAs target genes were performed. In addition, a deregulated miRNA-19b-3p-based miRNA-circRNA-lncRNA-mRNA network was confirmed, by gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments, to function in the process of ossification. Taken together, this study provides a systematic perspective on the potential function of ncRNAs in the pathogenesis of OLF.",

The \u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is essential for A\u03b2 generation and dysregulation of BACE1 expression may lead to AD pathogenesis. Bcl-2-associated athanogen 1M (BAG-1M), initially identified as an anti-apoptotic protein, has also been found to be highly expressed in the same neurons that contain intracellular amyloid in the hippocampus of AD patient. In this report, we found that over-expression of BAG-1M enhances BACE1-mediated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and A\u03b2 production by up-regulating BACE1 gene transcription. The regulation of BACE1 transcription by BAG-1M was dependent on NF-\u03baB, as BAG-1M complexes NF-\u03baB at the promoter of BACE1 gene and co-activates NF-\u03baB-facilitated BACE1 transcription. Moreover, expression of BAG-1M by lentiviral vector in the hippocampus of AD transgenic model mice promotes A\u03b2 generation and formation of neuritic plaque, and subsequently accelerates memory deficits of the mice. These results provide evidence for an emerging role of BAG-1M in the regulation of BACE1 expression and AD pathogenesis and that targeting the BAG-1M-NF-\u03baB complex may provide a mechanism for inhibiting A\u03b2 production and plaque formation.",

        "abstract": "The aberrant accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) in the brain is a key feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and enhanced cleavage of \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) has a major causative role in AD. Despite their prominence in AD pathogenesis, the regulation of BACE1 and APP is incompletely understood. In this study, we report that the circular RNA circular RNA sponge for miR-7 (ciRS-7) has an important role in regulating BACE1 and APP protein levels. Previous studies have shown that ciRS-7, which is highly expressed in the human brain, is down-regulated in the brain of people with AD but the relevance of this finding was not clear. We have found that ciRS-7 is not involved in the regulation of APP and BACE1 gene expression, but instead reduces the protein levels of APP and BACE1 by promoting their degradation via the proteasome and lysosome. Consequently, overexpression of ciRS-7 reduces the generation of A\u03b2, indicating a potential neuroprotective role of ciRS-7. Our data also suggest that ciRS-7 modulates APP and BACE1 levels in a nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB)-dependent manner: ciRS-7 expression inhibits translation of NF-\u03baB and induces its cytoplasmic localization, thus derepressing expression of UCHL1, which promotes APP and BACE1 degradation. Additionally, we demonstrated that APP reduces the level of ciRS-7, revealing a mutual regulation of ciRS-7 and APP. Taken together, our data provide a molecular mechanism implicating reduced ciRS-7 expression in AD, suggesting that ciRS-7 may represent a useful target in the development of therapeutic strategies for AD.",

However, the clinical significance of lncRNAs and their functions in liver fibrosis remain largely unclear.  The transcript of lncRNA SCARNA10 in serum and liver samples from patients with advanced hepatic fibrosis, liver tissues from two fibrosis mouse models, and cultured hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) was determined by real-time RT-PCR. The effects of lentivirus-mediated knockdown or over-expression of SCARNA10 in liver fibrosis were examined  and . Moreover, the effects and mechanisms of down-regulation or over-expression of SCARNA10 on the expression of the genes involved in TGF\u03b2 pathway were determined.  It was found lncRNA ENSMUST00000158992, named as Scarna10, was remarkably up-regulated in mouse fibrotic livers according to the microarray data. We observed that the transcript of SCARNA10 was increased in the serum and liver from patients with advanced hepatic fibrosis. Furthermore, we found that SCARNA10 promoted liver fibrosis both  and  through inducing hepatocytes (HCs) apoptosis and HSCs activation. Mechanistically, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays demonstrated that SCARNA10 physically associated with polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Additionally, our results demonstrated that SCARNA10 functioned as a novel positive regulator of TGF\u03b2 signaling in hepatic fibrogenesis by inhibiting the binding of PRC2 to the promoters of the genes associated with ECM and TGF\u03b2 pathway, thus promoting the transcription of these genes.  Our study identified a crucial role of SCARNA10 in liver fibrosis, providing a proof of this molecule as a potential diagnostic marker and a possible therapeutic target against liver fibrosis.",

        "abstract": "Topological insulators are an emerging class of materials that host highly robust in-gap surface or interface states while maintaining an insulating bulk. Most advances in this field have focused on topological insulators and related topological crystalline insulators in two dimensions and three dimensions, but more recent theoretical work has predicted the existence of one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological phases in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). The topological phase of these laterally confined, semiconducting strips of graphene is determined by their width, edge shape and terminating crystallographic unit cell and is characterized by a [Formula: see text] invariant (that is, an index of either 0 or 1, indicating two topological classes-similar to quasi-one-dimensional solitonic systems). Interfaces between topologically distinct GNRs characterized by different\u00a0values of [Formula: see text] are predicted to support half-filled, in-gap localized electronic states that could, in principle, be used as a tool for material engineering. Here we present the rational design and experimental realization of a topologically engineered GNR superlattice that hosts a one-dimensional array of such states, thus generating otherwise inaccessible electronic structures. This strategy also enables new end states to be engineered directly into the termini of the one-dimensional GNR superlattice. Atomically precise topological GNR superlattices were synthesized from molecular precursors on a gold surface, Au(111), under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions and characterized by low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy. Our experimental results and first-principles calculations reveal that the frontier band structure\u00a0(the bands bracketing filled and empty states) of these GNR superlattices is defined purely by the coupling between adjacent topological interface states. This manifestation of non-trivial one-dimensional topological phases presents a route to band engineering in one-dimensional materials based on precise control of their electronic topology, and is a promising platform for studies of one-dimensional quantum spin physics.",

Currently, single responsive strategy still cannot entirely satisfy the requirements of practical applications. In this study, we developed one kind of combination-responsive phototherapeutic nanoplatforms, where oxygen deficient molybdenum oxide (MoO) hybridized hyaluronic acid (HA) hollow nanospheres, namely MoO@HA HNSs, were constructed via a facile one-step method. In MoO@HA HNSs, the reasonable combination of actively targeted specificity endowed by HA component and tumor microenvironment-responsive phototherapy activity induced by MoO component can effectively improve the precision of phototherapy. The results of in vitro and in vivo experiments confirm that MoO@HA HNSs can selectively kill CD44-overexpressing cancer cells and inhibit tumor growth with irradiation from an 808 nm laser, revealing their remarkable synergistic photothermal therapy/photodynamic therapy effect with CD44 receptor-targeted specificity and pH-responsiveness in treating cancer. We also prove that MoO@HA HNSs can be used as a contrast agent for the computed tomography/photoacoustic imaging imaging. Encouraged by these results, it is anticipated that the reasonable combination of active targeting and tumor microenvironment responsiveness can be promising strategy to develop phototherapeutic nanoplatforms for precise multi-modality cancer theranostics.",

In this nanosystem, HA component endows HA-Ru NAs with RMT characteristic to selectively recognize CD44-overexpressing cancer cells, while Ru nanocomponent makes that HA-Ru NAs have TMR therapy activity. Specially, Ru nanocomponent not only has near-infrared mediated photothermal and photodynamic functions but also can catalyze H2O2 in tumor tissue to produce O2 for the alleviation of tumor hypoxia and toxic \u2022OH for chemodynamic therapy. Benefitting from these, HA-Ru NAs can be considered as one promising kind of CRS nanoplatform for synergistic photothermal/photodynamic/chemodynamic therapies of cancer, which will not only effectively improve the phototherapeutic speci\ufb01city and efficacy, but also simplify the therapeutic nanosystems. Meanwhile, HA-Ru NAs can serve as a photoacoustic and computed tomography imaging contrast agent to monitor tumor.

        "abstract": "Many spotted-leaf mutants show enhanced disease resistance to multiple pathogen attacks; however, the mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we reported a novel semi-dominant spotted-leaf mutant 24 (spl24) obtained from an ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-induced IR64 mutant bank. spl24 developed tiny brown lesions on the leaf tip and spread down gradually to the leaf base as well as the sheath at the early heading stage. The performances of major agronomic traits such as the plant height, panicle length, number of panicles/plant, and 1000-grain weight were significantly altered in spl24 when compared to the wild-type IR64. Furthermore, spl24 exhibited a premature senescing phenotype with degeneration of nuclear acids, significantly reduced soluble protein content, increased level of malonaldehyde (MDA), and lowered activities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes. Disease evaluation indicated that spl24 showed enhanced resistance to multiple races of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the causal pathogen of bacterial leaf blight in rice, with elevated expression of pathogenesis-related genes, salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway-associated genes revealed by real-time quantitative PCR and high-throughput RNA sequencing analysis. Genetic analysis and gene mapping indicated that the lesion mimic phenotype was controlled by a novel semi-dominant nuclear gene. The mutation, tentatively termed as OsSPL24, was in a 110 kb region flanked by markers Indel-33 and Indel-12 in chromosome 11. Together, our data suggest that spl24 is a novel lesion mimic mutant with enhanced innate immunity and would facilitate the isolation and functional characterization of the target gene.",

However, the available evidence is limited in pregnant Chinese women. We aimed to explore the associations of three polymorphisms (rs10830962, rs7754840 and rs1470579) with GDM risk in a Chinese population. We conducted a case-control study (964 GDM cases and 1,021 controls) to evaluate the associations of these polymorphisms with GDM risk. A logistic regression model was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and their confidence intervals (CIs). After adjustment for age, prepregnancy BMI, parity, abnormal pregnancy history and family history of diabetes, the minor allele of rs10830962 (C\u2009>\u2009G) demonstrated a significant association with an increased risk of GDM (OR\u2009=\u20091.16, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.02-1.31, P\u2009=\u20090.029 in the additive model). However, no significant association was observed between the other two polymorphisms and GDM. Subsequent functional annotation shows that rs10830962 is located in the regulatory elements of pancreatic islets, alters the binding affinity of motifs and regulates SNORA8 expression. Our findings demonstrate that rs10830962 is associated with an increased risk of GDM in the Chinese population. Further functional characterization is warranted to uncover the mechanism of the genotype-phenotype association.",

Logistic regression analyses showed that rs11127496\u2009A > G, rs12714417 C > T, and rs1320334\u2009A > G conferred a decreased GDM risk in the recessive and additive model, whereas rs11691220 T\u2009>\u2009C conferred an increased GDM risk in the dominant and additive model. Also, with increasing number of protective alleles of the four SNPs, the risk of GDM was significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner (\u2009=\u20090.007). Further function annotation indicated that these four SNPs may fall on the function elements of human pancreatic islets.

We sought to determine the influence of the PTPRD variants on the gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk. In this research, two SNPs in PTPRD reported in T2D GWASs and six PTPRD expression-related SNPs were genotyped in 964 GDM cases and 1,021 controls using the Sequenom platform. Logistic regression analyses in additive models showed consistently significant associations of PTPRD rs10511544 A>C, rs10756026 T>A and rs10809070 C>G with a decreased risk of GDM [adjusted OR (95% CI) = 0.83 (0.72-0.97) for rs10511544; adjusted OR (95% CI) = 0.81 (0.70-0.94) for rs10756026; adjusted OR (95% CI) = 0.78 (0.65-0.92) for rs10809070]. Furthermore, the risk of GDM was significantly decreased with an increasing number of variant alleles of the three SNPs in a dose-dependent manner (Ptrend = 0.008). Moreover, the haplotype containing variant alleles of the three SNPs were significantly associated with a decreased risk of GDM [adjusted OR (95% CI) = 0.77 (0.64-0.92), P = 0.005], when compared with the most frequent haplotype. However, there were no significant associations for the SNPs reported in the T2D GWASs. Altogether, these findings indicate that the variants of rs10511544, rs10756026 and rs10809070 in PTPRD may contribute to a decreased susceptibility to GDM. Further validation in different ethnic backgrounds and biological function analyses are needed.",

        "abstract": "17beta-estradiol (E2) is important for crustacean ovarian development. This study aims to investigate the distribution and change pattern of E2 in the ovary, hepatopancreas, thoracic ganglion and brain ganglion as well as Vg-mRNA expression level during ovarian development of Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis. Results showed that strongly positive signals of E2 were mainly distributed in follicle cells of ovaries for all developmental stages as well as oocyte cytoplasm of stages III to V ovaries. In hepatopancreas, the E2-positive signal was mainly detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus of fibrillar cells and the nucleus of resorptive cells, while the maximum fluorescence intensity was observed in stage III hepatopancreas. On the contrary, the E2 immunoreactivities in nervous tissues were relatively stable during ovarian development. Moreover, the changing pattern of E2 concentration was similar within hemolymph, ovary and hepatopancreas during the ovarian development. From stages I to III, the E2 content in three tissues increased significantly, then decreased gradually until stage V. As for the Vg-mRNA expression level in hepatopancreas and ovaries, an increasing trend was found in ovaries but no significant difference was detected during the period of ovarian stages III to V. Hepatopancreatic Vg-mRNA expression level increased significantly during stages I to IV and dramatically decreased at stage V. In conclusion, our study suggests that ovary, hepatopancreas, hemolymph and nervous tissues are the target organs of E2 in E. sinensis and E2 concentrations in different tissues are closely related to vitellogenesis in ovary and hepatopancreas during ovarian development.",

        "abstract": "Lupus nephritis (LN), an autoimmune kidney disease caused by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), is the inflammation of the kidney. Although the treatment of LN is still a therapeutic challenge for many practitioners, the present study aims to provide a new insight for the treatment and management. The study aims to explore the effect of A20 on LN in relation to the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway. MRL/lpr mice were used as the LN mouse model. Next, A20, UCH-L1, and NF-\u03baB expression in LN patients and MRL/lpr mice was determined. A20 was upregulated in podocytes to assess biological functions of A20 in LN. Furthermore, to further investigate the pivotal role of the NF-\u03baB pathway in LN, the NF-\u03baB pathway was blocked in podocytes. Next, UCH-L1 was downregulated in MRL/lpr mice to assess biological functions of UCH-L1 in LN. A20 was downregulated, whereas UCH-L1 was upregulated in LN. Overexpressed A20 declined NF-\u03baB, UCH-L1 expression, and the extent of p65 phosphorylation. A20 overexpression or UCH-L1 inhibition increased expression of synaptoporin and nephrin but decreased desmin expression and ubiquitin accumulation level in podocytes. Moreover, A20 overexpression or UCH-L1 inhibition increased the podocyte number but decreased protein level of cleaved caspase-3, podocyte lesion improvement, decreased foot process width, glomerulus basement membrane, and foot process fusion rate. In addition, urine protein, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and ds-DNA antibody levels decreased with elevated A20 or depleted UCH-L1. Collectively, it could be concluded that A20 protects against podocyte injury in LN via UCH-L1 by inactivating the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.",

In this study, we explored the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in the default mode network (DMN) to show the mechanism of neurophysiology in patients with OSAHS. Resting-state structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data were obtained from sixteen male moderate-to- severe patients with untreated OSAHS and 15 male matched healthy control subjects. The rsFC in the DMN was analyzed between OSAHS and healthy controls by the CONN software. Compared with the controls, the rsFC showed a significant decrease in the the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate and posterior cingulate, and showed an increase in the left inferior parietal lobule in OSAHS patients. The results indicated that the OSAHS patients presented alternatives of rsFC in the DMN compared with the controls.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Objective  To explore the small-world properties of brain functional networks in patients with obstructive sleep apnea\u2212hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) to aid diagnosis.    Methods  A total of 29 OSAHS patients and 26 matched healthy volunteers were scanned with blood oxygen level\u2212dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) separately, and the whole brain was divided into 90 districts via automated anatomical labeling. The matrix  Z  was then built through a Fisher  Z  transformation. Two-sample  t  tests were applied to evaluate the changes in small-world properties in OSAHS patients compared to the control group. The properties included  E  global ,  E  local , and small-world parameters  L   p  ,  C   p  ,  \u03b3 ,  \u03bb , and  \u03c3 .    Results  Both groups satisfied the small-world properties ( \u03c3 u003e1) within the sparsity range of 0.1\u22120.2. However, compared with the control group, the OSAHS group performed significantly lower in  C   p  ,  E  local , and  E  global  ( p   L   p   ( p   \u03b3 ,  \u03c3 , and  \u03bb  values were not significantly different between the two groups.    Conclusion  Both healthy and OSAHS patients exhibited small-world properties in functional networks, but a subset of these small-world properties in OSAHS patients performed differently. These changes will not only provide a new perspective for pathophysiological mechanisms of OSAHS but will also help in understanding the disease in terms of whole-brain functional networks.",

Determining whether those children suffer from respiratory complications may be useful for future preoperative planning and family counseling. The present study aimed to investigate the features and FB-associated findings with respect to pulmonary diseases in children with congenital cardiovascular abnormalities. The role of FB in guiding the treatment and safety of procedures was also evaluated. A cohort of 57 children with congenital cardiovascular abnormalities underwent FB for pulmonary diseases between November 2013 and June 2015. The demographics, bronchoscopy diagnoses, cellular analysis and microbiology of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and the clinically valuable contributions and side-effects of FB were analyzed retrospectively. The bronchoscopies were performed in patients with a median age of 4 months (range, 9 days-9 years) and 9 patients were intubated and mechanically ventilated. The most common types of congenital cardiovascular abnormalities were atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus. External compression of airways, tracheobronchomalacia, laryngomalacia, and airway narrowing were the most common airway abnormalities revealed by FB. BALF cellular analysis revealed an elevated total cell count and neutrophil percentage; 19.2% specimens harbored an etiological agent. FB findings contributed towards the clinical management of 26.3% patients. The complications of FB were mild and transient. In the present study, the majority of patients with cardiovascular abnormalities exhibited other airway disorders. The present findings suggest that FB was a useful and safe tool in the evaluation of this specific group of children.",

        "abstract": "In [C. E. Kenig and E. M. Stein, Multilinear estimates and fractional integration, Math. Res. Lett., 6(1):1-15, 1999], the following type of multilinear fractional integral [ int_{bbR^{mn}} frac{f_1(l_1(x_1,ldots,x_m,x))cdots f_{m+1}(l_{m+1}(x_1,ldots,x_m,x))}{(|x_1|+ldots+|x_m|)^{lambda}} dx_1ldots dx_m ] was studied, where $l_i$ are linear maps from $bbR^{(m+1)n}$ to $bbR^n$ satisfying certain conditions. They proved the boundedness of such multilinear fractional integral from $L^{p_1}times ldots times L^{p_{m+1}}$ to $L^q$ when the indices satisfy the homogeneous condition. In this paper, we show that for certain indices, a similar conclusion is true whenever $f_1otimes ldots otimes f_{m+1}$ is replaced by general functions in the Lebesgue space with mixed norms. That is, the multilinear operator can be extended to a linear operator. In particular, for $m=1$ or $n=1$, we get a complete characterization of $(l_1, ldots, l_{m+1})$, $vec p=(p_1,ldots, p_{m+1})$, $q$ and $lambda$ such that the operator is bounded from $L^{vec p}$ to $L^q$.",

Starting from the carrier rate equations in different regions of device and considering the influences of non-uniform electric field, noise, parasitic effect and some other factors, the equivalent circuit model of SACM-APD device is established, in which the steady-state and transient current voltage characteristics can be described exactly. In addition, the proposed Ge/Si SACM APD equivalent circuit model is embedded in PSpice simulator. The important characteristics of Ge/Si SACM APD such as dark current, frequency response, shot noise are simulated, the simulation results show that the simulation with the proposed model are in good agreement with the experimental results.",

One of the major challenges in CMOS SPADs is how to raise the low photon detection efficiency (PDE). In this paper, the device structure and process parameters of the CMOS SPAD are optimized so as to improve PDE properties which have been investigated in detail. The CMOS SPADs are designed in p+/n-well/deep n-well (DNW) structure with the p-sub and the p-well guard ring (GR). The simulation results show that with the p-well GR, the quantum efficiency (QE) is about 80% with the breakdown voltage of 12.7 V, the unit responsivity is as high as 0.38 A/W and the PDE of 51% and 53% is obtained when the excess bias is at 1 V and 2 V, respectively. The dark count rate (DCR) is 6.2 kHz when bias voltage is 14 V. With the p-sub GR, the breakdown voltage is 13 V, the unit responsivity is up to 0.26 A/W, the QE is 58%, the PDE is 33% and 37% at excess bias of 1 V and 2 V, respectively.
