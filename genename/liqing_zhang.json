        "title": "Computational model for perception of objects and motions.",
        "abstract": "Perception of objects and motions in the visual scene is one of the basic problems in the visual system. There exist 'What' and 'Where' pathways in the superior visual cortex, starting from the simple cells in the primary visual cortex. The former is able to perceive objects such as forms, color, and texture, and the latter perceives 'where', for example, velocity and direction of spatial movement of objects. This paper explores brain-like computational architectures of visual information processing. We propose a visual perceptual model and computational mechanism for training the perceptual model. The computational model is a three-layer network. The first layer is the input layer which is used to receive the stimuli from natural environments. The second layer is designed for representing the internal neural information. The connections between the first layer and the second layer, called the receptive fields of neurons, are self-adaptively learned based on principle of sparse neural representation. To this end, we introduce Kullback-Leibler divergence as the measure of independence between neural responses and derive the learning algorithm based on minimizing the cost function. The proposed algorithm is applied to train the basis functions, namely receptive fields, which are localized, oriented, and bandpassed. The resultant receptive fields of neurons in the second layer have the characteristics resembling that of simple cells in the primary visual cortex. Based on these basis functions, we further construct the third layer for perception of what and where in the superior visual cortex. The proposed model is able to perceive objects and their motions with a high accuracy and strong robustness against additive noise. Computer simulation results in the final section show the feasibility of the proposed perceptual model and high efficiency of the learning algorithm.",

It enables users to add search conditions by modifying the color, texture, shape and attribute descriptors of the query images to further refine their requirements. We propose the Hybrid Topic (HT) model to learn the intricate semantic representation of the descriptors above. The model provides an effective multi-dimensional representation of clothes and is able to perform automatic image annotation by probabilistic reasoning from image search. Furthermore, we develop a demand-adaptive retrieval strategy which refines users' specific requirements and removes users' unwanted features. Our experiments show that the HT method significantly outperforms the deep neural network methods. The accuracy could be further improved in cooperation with image annotation and demand-adaptive retrieval strategy.",

However, most previous works focused on low level descriptors of shapes and sketches. In this paper, we try to step forward and propose to leverage shape words descriptor for sketch-based image retrieval. First, the shape words are defined and an efficient algorithm is designed for shape words extraction. Then we generalize the classic Chamfer Matching algorithm to address the shape words matching problem. Finally, a novel inverted index structure is proposed to make shape words representation scalable to large scale image databases. Experimental results show that our method achieves competitive accuracy but requires much less memory, e.g., less than 3% of memory storage of MindFinder. Due to its competitive accuracy and low memory cost, our method can scale up to much larger database.",

        "abstract": "An alternative pathway for the human brain to communicate with the outside world is by means of a brain computer interface (BCI). A BCI can decode electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of brain activities, and then send a command or an intent to an external interactive device, such as a wheelchair. The effectiveness of the BCI depends on the performance in decoding the EEG. Usually, the EEG is contaminated by different kinds of artefacts (e.g., electromyogram (EMG), background activity), which leads to a low decoding performance. A number of filtering methods can be utilized to remove or weaken the effects of artefacts, but they generally fail when the EEG contains extreme artefacts. In such cases, the most common approach is to discard the whole data segment containing extreme artefacts. This causes the fatal drawback that the BCI cannot output decoding results during that time. In order to solve this problem, we employ the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to estimate the spectral power from incomplete EEG (after removing only parts contaminated by artefacts), and Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) for learning. The proposed method is evaluated with motor imagery EEG data. The results show that our method can successfully decode incomplete EEG to good effect.",

We encode speech as a general higher-order tensor in order to extract discriminative features in spectrotemporal domain. Firstly, speech signals are represented by cochlear feature based on frequency selectivity characteristics at basilar membrane and inner hair cells; then, low-dimension sparse features are extracted by NTPCA for robust speaker modeling. The useful information of each subspace in the higher-order tensor can be preserved. Alternating projection algorithm is used to obtain a stable solution.

        "abstract": "Human action recognition is a challenging computer vision task and many efforts have been made to improve the performance. Most previous work has concentrated on the hand-crafted features or spatial-temporal features learned from multiple contiguous frames. In this paper, we present a dual-channel model to decouple the spatial and temporal feature extraction. More specifically, we propose to capture the complementary static form information from single frame and dynamic motion information from multi-frame differences in two separate channels. In both channels we use two stacked classical subspace networks to learn hierarchical representations, which are subsequently fused for action recognition. Our model is trained and evaluated on three typical benchmarks: KTH, UCF and Hollywood2 datasets. The experimental results illustrate that our approach achieves comparable performances to the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, both feature analysis and control experiments are also carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for feature extraction and thereby action recognition.",

Most existing CBIR systems find similar images in low level features, while Text-based Image Retrieval TBIR systems find images with relevant tags regardless of contents in the images. Generally, people are more interested in images with similarity both in contours and high-level concepts. Therefore, we propose a new strategy called Deep Search to meet this requirement. It mines knowledge from the similar images of original queries, in order to compensate for the missing information in feature extraction process. To evaluate the performance of Deep Search approach, we apply this method to three different CBIR systems HOF [5], HOG and GIST in our experiments. The results show that Deep Search greatly improves the performance of original algorithms, and is not restricted to any particular methods.",

Some properties of the sparse representation approach are discussed. The natural gradient algorithm is used to train the external parameters in the stage of signal separa- tion.

        "abstract": "As tensors provide a natural and efficient representation of multidimensional structured data, in this paper, we consider probabilistic multinomial probit classification for tensor-variate inputs with Gaussian processes (GP) priors placed over the latent function. In order to take into account the underlying multimodes structure information within the model, we propose a framework of probabilistic product kernels for tensorial data based on a generative model assumption. More specifically, it can be interpreted as mapping tensors to probability density function space and measuring similarity by an information divergence. Since tensor kernels enable us to model input tensor observations, the proposed tensor-variate GP is considered as both a generative and discriminative model. Furthermore, a fully variational Bayesian treatment for multiclass GP classification with multinomial probit likelihood is employed to estimate the hyperparameters and infer the predictive distributions. Simulation results on both synthetic data and a real world application of human action recognition in videos demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach for classification of multiway tensor data, especially in the case that the underlying structure information among multimodes is discriminative for the classification task.

        "abstract": "A multilinear subspace regression model based on so called latent variable decomposition is introduced. Unlike standard regression methods which typically employ matrix (2D) data representations followed by vector subspace transformations, the proposed approach uses tensor subspace transformations to model common latent variables across both the independent and dependent data. The proposed approach aims to maximize the correlation between the so derived latent variables and is shown to be suitable for the prediction of multidimensional dependent data from multidimensional independent data, where for the estimation of the latent variables we introduce an algorithm based on Multilinear Singular Value Decomposition (MSVD) on a specially defined cross-covariance tensor. It is next shown that in this way we are also able to unify the existing Partial Least Squares (PLS) and N-way PLS regression algorithms within the same framework. Simulations on benchmark synthetic data confirm the advantages of the proposed approach, in terms of its predictive ability and robustness, especially for small sample sizes. The potential of the proposed technique is further illustrated on a real world task of the decoding of human intracranial electrocorticogram (ECoG) from a simultaneously recorded scalp electroencephalograph (EEG).",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel grouping decision approach for blind source estimation of FIR. (finite impulse response) channels with binary sources. First, solvability is discussed for single-input systems and multi-input systems. Necessary and sufficient conditions for recoverability are derived. For single-input systems, a new deterministic algorithm based on grouping and decision is proposed to recover the source up to a delay. The algorithm is easy to implement and has several advantages. For instance, when the solvability conditions are satisfied, it can be applied to cases in which: (i) the channel has zeros on the unit circle or outside of the unit circle; (ii) there are fewer sensors than sources; (iii) the source is temporarily dependent. To improve noise tolerance and reduce computational cost, the algorithm is further elaborated for highly noisy channels and high-order FIR channels, respectively. For the channels with high unimodal noise, fewer peaks appear in the probability density function (pdf) of the outputs compared to the pdf of the outputs of channels with a higher SNR. After the peaks representing cluster centers are estimated using a maximum likelihood (ML) approach, the deterministic algorithm can be used. Similar to highly noisy channels, the algorithm is also effective for high-order, exponentially decaying channels after fewer cluster centers are estimated. Furthermore, blind source estimation for multi-input systems also can be carried out as with the case of single input systems. Two deflation algorithms are presented for temporarily dependent sources and i.i.d. sources. Based on the source estimation and deflation algorithms, the sources can be obtained one by one. Finally, the validity and performance of the algorithms are illustrated by several simulation examples.",

A sparse speech feature representation is extracted by cNTF which is used for robust speaker modeling. Orthogonal and nonsmooth sparse control constraints are further imposed on the PARAFAC model in order to preserve the useful information of each feature subspace in the higher order tensor.

In this paper, we propose a two-stage based approach for extracting periodic signals. At the first stage, the autocorrelation property of the desired source signal is exploited to roughly extract the desired source signal. At the second stage, the extracted signal is further processed as cleanly as possible, based on the higher-order statistics. Simulations on artificially generated data and real-world ECG data have showed its better performance, compared with many existing extraction algorithms.",

This study examined ERP responses to objects, faces, and emotional faces when subjects performs visual attention, face recognition and categorization of emotional facial expressions respectively in an oddball paradigm.

Based on this, we use BP neural network to identify whether two fragments are from the same microorganism and obtain the similarity between fragments.

Although the BCI techniques have been developing quickly in recent decades, there still exist a number of unsolved problems, such as instability, unreliability and low transmission rate in real time applications of BCI. In the present study, we design a bilateral training framework for both human and the BCI system to improve recognition accuracy and to reduce the impact caused by non-stationary EEG signal. The statistical analysis is used to test whether there is an obvious improvement in recognition performance after using the bilateral adaptation strategy. The statistical analysis indicates that our algorithm is significantly different from the existing method in both conditions of trials (p=0.0073) and sliding time windows (p=0.00077). The results of statistical analysis reconfirm that performance using our algorithm is distinctly improved. The online experiments also demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves higher prediction accuracy and reliability compared with the existing method. The objective of our research is to transfer this strategy to some practical applications (e.g., electrical wheelchair control) for the better performance.",

Then Nonnegative Tensor PCA with sparse constraint is used to learn the projection matrices from multiple interrelated feature subspaces and extract the robust features.

Unlike the other topic models applied in the computer vision field, the words in our model are not discrete but continuous. They are generated by sparse coding and represented with n-dimensional vectors in R^n. In sparse coding, only a small set of components of each word is active, so we assume the probability distribution over these continuous words is Laplace and the parameters of the Laplace distribution depend on topics, which are the latent variables in this model. The relationship among word, topic, document and corpus in our model is similar to Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Thereby this model is a generalization of the traditional LDA by introducing the concept-continuous words. We use an EM algorithm to estimate the parameters in our model. And the proposed method is applied to some significant computer vision problems such as natural scene categorization and object classification. The experimental results show the method is a valuable direction to generalize topic models.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel computational model of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) that can induce competitive learning in neural networks, and hence can work as an efficient coding mechanism for temporal correlated neural activities. Most computational STDP models use either additive or multiplicative learning rules. Usually additive rules induce competition in many-to-one networks, yet they not only suffer from instability and slow converging speed, but also cannot be extended properly to many-to-many networks. Multiplicative rules on the other hand can reach stable results in a shorter time, but they do not cause competition in any kind of networks. So these models cannot readily explain complex phenomena in neural processing. Here we attack this problem by introducing a modified multiplicative STDP model with a mechanism called 'global depression', which induces competitive learning in many-to-many networks while preserves the virtues of original multiplicative models. Moreover, this model tends to group presynaptic neurons according to their firing patterns. Specifically, an ensemble of presynaptic neurons with correlated activities may collectively form strong connections with one postsynaptic neuron, while a different ensemble may connect with another postsynaptic neuron. Overall this model performs pattern grouping according to the input neural activities. We prove this point theoretically and experimentally in this paper.",

        "abstract": "The paper presents a simple and effective sketch-based algorithm for large scale image retrieval. One of the main challenges in image retrieval is to localize a region in an image which would be matched with the query image in contour. To tackle this problem, we use the human perception mechanism to identify two types of regions in one image: the first type of region (the main region) is defined by a weighted center of image features, suggesting that we could retrieve objects in images regardless of their sizes and positions. The second type of region, called region of interests (ROI), is to find the most salient part of an image, and is helpful to retrieve images with objects similar to the query in a complicated scene. So using the two types of regions as candidate regions for feature extraction, our algorithm could increase the retrieval rate dramatically. Besides, to accelerate the retrieval speed, we first extract orientation features and then organize them in a hierarchal way to generate global-to-local features. Based on this characteristic, a hierarchical database index structure could be built which makes it possible to retrieve images on a very large scale image database online. Finally a real-time image retrieval system on 4.5 million database is developed to verify the proposed algorithm. The experiment results show excellent retrieval performance of the proposed algorithm and comparisons with other algorithms are also given.",

Among a variety of BSE algorithms, a large number of algorithms are based on linear prediction (LP-BSE). In this paper we analyze them from practical point of view. We reveal that they are, in nature, minor component analysis (MCA) algorithms, and thus they have some problems that are inherent in MCA algorithms. We also find a switch phenomenon of online LP-BSE algorithms, showing that different parts of a single extracted signal are the counterparts of different source signals. The two issues should be noticed when one applies these algorithms to practical applications. Computer simulations are given to confirm these observations.",

However, the CSP is difficult to capture the nonlinearly clustered structure from the non-stationary EEG signals. To relax the presumption of strictly linear patterns in the CSP, in this paper, a generalized CSP (GCSP) based on generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) and kernel method is proposed. Our method is able to find the nonlinear spatial filters which are formulated in the feature space defined by a nonlinear mapping through kernel functions. Furthermore, in order to overcome the overfitting problem, the regularized GCSP is developed by adding the regularized parameters. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is an effective nonlinear spatial filtering method.",

In this way, we bring together the powerful GP methods supported by Bayesian inference and higher-order tensor analysis techniques into one framework. This enables us to account for the underlying structure of data within the model, providing a powerful framework for structural data analysis, such as 3D video sequences. To this end, we propose a new kernel function with tensor arguments under the assumption of generative models, in the form of product kernels where a symmetrical Kullback-Leibler divergence measure is exploited to define the covariance function for tensorial data. A fully Bayesian treatment is employed to estimate the hyperparameters and infer the predictive distributions. Simulation results on both the synthetic data and a real world application of estimating the crowd size from 3D videos demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

The system consists of three parts: face detection, face alignment and normalization, and age classification. We use standard face detection and face alignment method to generate face samples by automatically locating, cropping and aligning faces from images. We use ICA to extract statistically independent basis images which contain local facial components. Therefore, an image can be represented as a linear combination of those basis images. Then we choose a subset of basis images based on mutual information between them and class labels. Finally, we perform classification by SVM. Our experiment results show that our method provides better classification accuracy than conventional 1D or 2D projecting method.",

        "abstract": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) allows the use of brain activities for people to directly communicate with the external world or to control external devices without participation of any peripheral nerves and muscles. Motor imagery is one of the most popular modes in the research field of brain-computer interface. Although motor imagery BCI has some advantages compared with other modes of BCI, such as asynchronization, it is necessary to require training sessions before using it. The performance of trained BCI system depends on the quality of training samples or the subject engagement. In order to improve training effect and decrease training time, we proposed a new paradigm where subjects participated in training more actively than in the traditional paradigm. In the traditional paradigm, a cue (to indicate what kind of motor imagery should be imagined during the current trial) is given to the subject at the beginning of a trial or during a trial, and this cue is also used as a label for this trial. It is usually assumed that labels for trials are accurate in the traditional paradigm, although subjects may not have performed the required or correct kind of motor imagery, and trials may thus be mislabeled. And then those mislabeled trials give rise to interference during model training. In our proposed paradigm, the subject is required to reconfirm the label and can correct the label when necessary. This active training paradigm may generate better training samples with fewer inconsistent labels because it overcomes mistakes when subject's motor imagination does not match the given cues. The experiments confirm that our proposed paradigm achieves better performance; the improvement is significant according to statistical analysis.",

And then we develop efficient learning algorithms respectively. FPGA implementation of the proposed algorithm based on Signal- Master platform is also discussed. Computer simulations are given to show the separation performance of the proposed algorithm and some comparisons with other algorithms are also provided. \u00a9 2006 Springer.",

        "abstract": "A new generalized multilinear regression model, termed the higher order partial least squares (HOPLS), is introduced with the aim to predict a tensor (multiway array) Y from a tensor X through projecting the data onto the latent space and performing regression on the corresponding latent variables. HOPLS differs substantially from other regression models in that it explains the data by a sum of orthogonal Tucker tensors, while the number of orthogonal loadings serves as a parameter to control model complexity and prevent overfitting. The low-dimensional latent space is optimized sequentially via a deflation operation, yielding the best joint subspace approximation for both X and Y. Instead of decomposing X and Y individually, higher order singular value decomposition on a newly defined generalized cross-covariance tensor is employed to optimize the orthogonal loadings. A systematic comparison on both synthetic data and real-world decoding of 3D movement trajectories from electrocorticogram signals demonstrate the advantages of HOPLS over the existing methods in terms of better predictive ability, suitability to handle small sample sizes, and robustness to noise.",

Different from existing sketch recognition system, which is based on hand-drawn strokes, PPTLens enables users to use sketch images as inputs directly. It's more challenging since strokes extracted from sketch images might not only be very messy, but also without temporal information of the drawings. To implement the 'Image to Object' (I2O) scenario, we propose a novel sketch image recognition framework, including an effective stroke extraction strategy and a novel offline sketch parsing algorithm. By enabling sketch images as inputs, our system makes flowchart/diagram production much more convenient and easier.",

We designed an experiment to simulate natural viewing conditions, in which time dependent characteristics of the attention can be evoked; and we recorded the temporal responses of 6 subjects.

In the existing methods, the dictionary is either pre-defined or learned adaptively from the data under certain constraints such as sparsity or orthogonality, which often leads to an approximation solution. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised dictionary learning model with smooth shrinkage for image denoising. By incorporating the dictionary learning into the denoising target, our model is trained in a task-driven fashion without the need of explicit constraints. We analyze the proposed model theoretically and show that it tends to learn sparse and orthogonal dictionaries, which is further verified empirically. Experimental results on four different noise levels demonstrate the effectiveness of our model both quantitatively and visually in comparison with the classical dictionary-based denoising methods.",

        "abstract": "The human brain can send a command to external devices or communicate with the outside environment by the means of a brain computer interface (BCI) system. The effectiveness depends on how precisely specific brain activities can be identified from EEG. Noise is usually mixed into the EEG signal, and cannot be separated or filtered out in some cases. In a practical BCI system, the whole segment of EEG is discarded when a portion of that segment is contaminated by extreme noise or artifacts. This leads to the weakness that the BCI system cannot output decoding results during the period of that discarded segment. In order to solve this problem, we employed a Lomb-Scargle periodogram to estimate the spectral power based on an unevenly spaced segment, a portion of which has been removed due to noise contamination. According to the classification results of motor imagery data, the accuracy is not dramatically decreased along with increased proportion of data removal. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2013.",

In this paper, we propose a novel attention model to produce saliency maps by generating information distributions on incoming images. Our model automatically marks spots with large information amount as saliency, which ensures the system gains the maximum information acquisition through attending these spots. By building a biological computational framework, we use the neural coding length as the estimation of information, and introduce relative entropy to simplify this calculation. Additionally, a real attention system should be robust to scales. Inspired by the visual perception process, we design a hierarchical framework to handle multi-scale saliency. From experiments we demonstrated that the proposed attention model is efficient and adaptive. In comparison to mainstream approaches, our model achieves better accuracy on fitting human fixations.",

Modern BCI technology is essentially based on techniques for the classification of single-trial brain signals. With respect to the topographic patterns of brain rhythm modulations, the common spatial patterns (CSPs) algorithm has been proven to be very useful to produce subject-specific and discriminative spatial filters; but it didn't consider temporal structures of event-related potentials which may be very important for single-trial EEG classification. In this paper, we propose a new framework of feature extraction for classification of hand movement imagery EEG. Computer simulations on real experimental data indicate that independent residual analysis (IRA) method can provide efficient temporal features. Combining IRA features with the CSP method, we obtain the optimal spatial and temporal features with which we achieve the best classification rate. The high classification rate indicates that the proposed method is promising for an EEG-based brain-computer interface.",

An effective BCI system should be adaptive to and robust against the dynamic variations in brain signals. One solution to it is to adapt the model parameters of BCI system online. However, CSP is poor at adaptability since it is a batch type algorithm. To overcome this, in this paper, we propose the Incremental Common Spatial Pattern (ICSP) algorithm which performs the adaptive feature extraction on-line. This method allows us to perform the online adjustment of spatial filter. This procedure helps the BCI system robust to possible non-stationarity of the EEG data. We test our method to data from BCI motor imagery experiments, and the results demonstrate the good performance of adaptation of the proposed algorithm.",

The equiconvergent algorithm [4] has favorite properties such as isotropic convergence and universal convergence, but it requires to estimate unknown activation functions and certain unknown statistics of source signals. The estimation of such activation functions and statistics becomes critical in realizing the equi-convergent algorithm. It is the purpose of this paper to develop a new approach to estimate the activation functions adaptively for blind source separation. We propose the exponential type family as a model for probability density functions. A method of constructing an exponential family from the activation (score) functions is proposed. Then, a learning rule based on the meximum likelihood is derived to update the parameters in the exponential family. The learning rule is compatible with minimization of mutual information for training demixing models. Finally, computer simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of the proposed approach.",

Different from existing work, most of which is limited to a small scale database or only enables single modality input, MindFinder is a sketch-based multimodal search engine for million-level database. It enables users to sketch major curves of the target image in their mind, and also supports tagging and coloring operations to better express their search intentions. Owning to a friendly interface, our system supports multiple actions, which help users to flexibly design their queries. After each operation, top returned images are updated in real time, based on which users could interactively refine their initial thoughts until ideal images are returned. The novelty of the MindFinder system includes the following two aspects: 1) A multimodal searching scheme is proposed to retrieve images which meet users' requirements not only in structure, but also in semantic meaning and color tone. 2) An indexing framework is designed to make MindFinder scalable in terms of database size, memory cost, and response time. By scaling up the database to more than two million images, MindFinder not only helps users to easily present whatever they are imagining, but also has the potential to retrieve the most desired images in their mind.",

We use non- negative matrix factorization to construct two layers of auditory neu- rons which captures the essence of speech patterns. The responses of these neurons to speech are further processed to form an auditory neural cepstral coefficient (ANCC) representation for speech recog- nition. We test the robustness of ANCC feature on a 51-word corpus, with recognizers trained on clean speech in noisy conditions. Com- pared with MFCC, ANCC shows less performance degradation and achieves satisfactory recognition accuracies in both non-stationary noise and high noise level conditions.",

        "abstract": "We propose a generative model for robust tensor factorization in the presence of both missing data and outliers. The objective is to explicitly infer the underlying low-CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)-rank tensor capturing the global information and a sparse tensor capturing the local information (also considered as outliers), thus providing the robust predictive distribution over missing entries. The low-CP-rank tensor is modeled by multilinear interactions between multiple latent factors on which the column sparsity is enforced by a hierarchical prior, while the sparse tensor is modeled by a hierarchical view of Student-t distribution that associates an individual hyperparameter with each element independently. For model learning, we develop an efficient variational inference under a fully Bayesian treatment, which can effectively prevent the overfitting problem and scales linearly with data size. In contrast to existing related works, our method can perform model selection automatically and implicitly without the need of tuning parameters. More specifically, it can discover the groundtruth of CP rank and automatically adapt the sparsity inducing priors to various types of outliers. In addition, the tradeoff between the low-rank approximation and the sparse representation can be optimized in the sense of maximum model evidence. The extensive experiments and comparisons with many state-of-the-art algorithms on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the superiorities of our method from several perspectives.",

Most existing CBIR systems find similar images in low level features, while Text-based Image Retrieval (TBIR) systems find images with relevant tags regardless of contents in the images. Generally, people are more interested in images with similarity both in contours and high-level concepts. Therefore, we propose a new strategy called  to meet this requirement. It mines knowledge from the similar images of original queries, in order to compensate for the missing information in feature extraction process. To evaluate the performance of  approach, we apply this method to four different CBIR systems (HOF Zhou et al. in ACM international conference on multimedia, ; Zhou and Zhang in Neural information processing\u2014international conference, ICONIP 2011, Shanghai, , HOG Dalal and Triggs in IEEE computer society conference on computer vision pattern recognition, , GIST Oliva and Torralba in Int J Comput Vision 42:145\u2013175,  and CNN Krizhevsky et al. in Adv Neural Inf Process Syst 25:2012, ) in our experiments.

We apply the proposed modeling program in two different modules of our online BCI-FES rehabilitation platform and achieve a relatively higher discrimination accuracy.

        "abstract": "We present a novel sampling approach to explore large protein conformational transitions by determining unique substates from instantaneous normal modes calculated from an elastic network model, and applied to a progression of atomistic molecular dynamics snapshots. This unbiased sampling scheme allows us to direct the path sampling between the conformational end states over simulation timescales that are greatly reduced relative to the known experimental timescales. We use adenylate kinase as a test system to show that instantaneous normal modes can be used to identify substates that drive the structural fluctuations of adenylate kinase from its closed to open conformations, in which we observe 16 complete transitions in 4 \u03bcs of simulation time, reducing the timescale over conventional simulation timescales by two orders of magnitude. Analysis shows that the unbiased determination of substates is consistent with known pathways determined experimentally. \u00a9 2010 by the Biophysical Society.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a Bayesian estimation approach to extend independent subspace analysis (ISA) for an overcomplete representation without imposing the orthogonal constraint. Our method is based on a synthesis of ISA [1] and overcomplete independent component analysis [2] developed by Hyv\u00e4rinen et al. By introducing the variables of dot products (between basis vectors and whitened observed data vectors), we investigate the energy correlations of dot products in each subspace. Based on the prior probability of quasi-orthogonal basis vectors, theMAP (maximum a posteriori) estimation method is used for learning overcomplete independent feature subspaces. A gradient ascent algorithm is derived to maximize the posterior probability of the mixing matrix. Simulation results on natural images demonstrate that the proposed model can yield overcomplete independent feature subspaces and the emergence of phase- and limited shift-invariant features--the principal properties of visual complex cells.",

However, popular classification algorithms, e.g., common spatial patterns (CSP), usually highly depend on the prior neurophysiologic knowledge for noise removing, although this knowledge is not always known in practical applications. In this paper, a novel tensor-based scheme is proposed for single trial EEG classification, which performs well without the prior neurophysiologic knowledge. In this scheme, EEG signals are represented in the spatial-spectral-temporal domain by the wavelet transform, the multilinear discriminative subspace is reserved by the general tensor discriminant analysis (GTDA), redundant indiscriminative patterns are removed by Fisher score, and the classification is conducted by the support vector machine (SVM). Applications to three datasets confirm the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed tensor scheme in analyzing EEG signals, especially in the case of lacking prior neurophysiologic knowledge.",

Although query-by-sketch has been extensively studied since 1990s, it is still very challenging to build a real-time sketch-based image search engine on a large-scale database due to the lack of effective and efficient matching/indexing solutions. The explosive growth of web images and the phenomenal success of search techniques have encouraged us to revisit this problem and target at solving the problem of web-scale sketch-based image retrieval. In this work, a novel index structure and the corresponding raw contour-based matching algorithm are proposed to calculate the similarity between a sketch query and natural images, and make sketch-based image retrieval scalable to millions of images. The proposed solution simultaneously considers storage cost, retrieval accuracy, and efficiency, based on which we have developed a real-time sketch-based image search engine by indexing more than 2 million images. Extensive experiments on various retrieval tasks (basic shape search, specific image search, and similar image search) show better accuracy and efficiency than state-of-the-art methods.",

One popular model Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition (NTD) allows us to explore the interactions of different factors with nonnegative constraints. In order to reduce degeneracy problem of tensor decomposition caused by component delays, convolutive tensor decomposition model is an appropriate model for exploring temporal correlations. In this paper, a flexible two stage algorithm for K-mode Convolutive Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition (K-CNTD) model is proposed using an alternating least square procedure. This model can be seen as a convolutive extension of Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition. The patterns across columns in convolutive tensor model are investigated to represent audio and image considering multiple factors. We employ the K-CNTD algorithm to extract the shift-invariant sparse features in different subspaces for robust speaker recognition and Alzheimer's Disease(AD) diagnosis task. The experimental results confirm the validity of our proposed algorithm and indicate that it is able to improve the speaker recognition performance especially in noisy conditions and has potential application on AD diagnosis.",

This method unified three important statistical properties: sparseness, temporal coherence, and topographic dependencies. However, this approach does not consider the overcomplete case. It is widely believed that the overcomplete representation is more efficient than the complete representation. In this paper, we use Bayesian estimation to extend the bubble coding into overcomplete case. Based on a quasi-orthogonality in a high-dimensional space, the prior probability of the mixing matrix is derived. Instead of examining basis coefficient, we investigate the dot product between basis functions and whitened observed data vectors for their sparseness and the advantage in the Bayesian model. Based on the bubble detector definition, an approximation of the prior probability of this dot product is given. Simulation results suggest that the overcomplete bubble coding can be achieved by a Bayesian inference. The model is promising in a wide variety of applications, such as image processing and pattern recognition.",

A new approach called nonnegative tensor principal component analysis (NTPCA) with sparse constraint is proposed for speech feature extraction. We encode speech as a general higher-order tensor in order to extract discriminative features in spectrotemporal domain. Firstly, speech signals are represented by cochlear feature based on frequency selectivity characteristics at basilar membrane and inner hair cells; then, low-dimension sparse features are extracted by NTPCA for robust speaker modeling. The useful information of each subspace in the higher-order tensor can be preserved. Alternating projection algorithm is used to obtain a stable solution.

        "abstract": "Next-generation, high-throughput sequencers are now capable of producing hundreds of billions of short sequences (reads) in a single day. The task of accurately mapping the reads back to a reference genome is of particular importance because it is used in several other biological applications, e.g., genome re-sequencing, DNA methylation, and ChiP sequencing. On a personal computer (PC), the computationally intensive short-read mapping task currently requires several hours to execute while working on very large sets of reads and genomes. Accelerating this task requires parallel computing. Among the current parallel computing platforms, the graphics processing unit (GPU) provides massively parallel computational prowess that holds the promise of accelerating scientific applications at low cost. In this paper, we propose GPU-RMAP, a massively parallel version of the RMAP short-read mapping tool that is highly optimized for the NVIDIA family of GPUs. We then evaluate GPU-RMAP by mapping millions of synthetic and real reads of varying widths on the mosquito (Aedes aegypti) and human genomes. We also discuss the effects of various input parameters, such as read width, number of reads, and chromosome size, on the performance of GPU-RMAP. We then show that despite using the conventionally \u201cslower\u201d but GPU-compatible binary search algorithm, GPU-RMAP outperforms the sequential RMAP implementation, which uses the \u201cfaster\u201d hashing technique on a PC. Our data-parallel GPU implementation results in impressive speedups of up to 14:5-times for the mapping kernel and up to 9:6-times for the overall program execution time over the sequential RMAP implementation on a traditional PC.",

This paper presents a surprisingly simple algorithm to detect objects in such conditions. Based on theoretic analysis, we show that 1) the displacement of the foreground and the background can be represented by the phase change of Fourier spectra, and 2) the motion of background objects can be extracted by Phase Discrepancy in an efficient and robust way. The algorithm does not rely on prior training on particular features or categories of an image and can be implemented in 9 lines of MATLAB code. In addition to the algorithm, we provide a new database for moving object detection with 20 video clips, 11 subjects and 4785 bounding boxes to be used as a public benchmark for algorithm evaluation.",

        "abstract": "A number of cortex-like hierarchical models of object recognition have been proposed these years. In this paper, we improve them by introducing supervision during forming combined local features. The traditional cortex-like hierarchical models always contain three layers which imitate the functions of neurons in ventral visual stream of primates. The bottom layer detects orientation information in a local area. Then the middle layer combines these information to form combined features. Finally, the top layer integrates combined features to form global features which are input into a classifier. In these models, three stages to form global features are all unsupervised. The supervision procedure only occurs after global features are generated, which is implemented by the classifier. But we think the supervision should occurs earlier. For a particular object recognition task, the second stage of generating global features is also supervised because only task relevant combinations are useful. In our paper, we analyze why introducing supervision in this stage is necessary. And we explain task relevant combined local features can be extracted by some feature selection algorithms. We also apply this improved system to a series of object classification problems and compare it with traditional models. The simulation results show that our improvement really boosts object recognition performance.",

The main issue in the development of a kernel-based framework for tensorial data is that the kernel functions have to be defined on tensor-valued input, which here is defined based on multi-mode product kernels and probabilistic generative models. This strategy enables taking into account the underlying multilinear structure during the learning process. Based on the defined kernels for tensorial data, we develop a kernel-based tensor partial least squares approach for regression. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated by a real-world application, i.e., the reconstruction of 3D movement trajectories from electrocorticography signals recorded from a monkey brain.",

        "abstract": "The performance of speech recognition systems relies on the consistency and adaptation of the speech feature in complex conditions during the training and testing stages. Traditional systems usually perform poorly under adverse noisy conditions and are not applicable to most real world problems. In this paper, we investigate the speech feature extraction problem in a noisy environment and propose a novel approach based on Gabor filtering and tensor factorization. Recent physiological and psychoacoustic experimental results suggest that the localized spectro-temporal features are essential for auditory perception. To explore this property, we represent the speech signal by using a general higher order tensor and employ two-dimensional Gabor functions with different scales and directions to analyze the localized patches of the power spectrogram. Then the Nonnegative Tensor PCA with sparse constraints is proposed to learn the projection matrices from multiple interrelated feature subspaces. The objective of the sparse constraints is to preserve the statistical characteristic of clean speech data by finding projection matrices of speech subspaces and reduce the noise components which have distributions different from those of clean speech. A multifactor analysis method is proposed to extract robust sparse features by processing the data samples in tensor structure. The simulation results indicate that our proposed method is able to improve the speech recognition performance, especially in noisy environments, compared with the traditional speech feature extraction methods.",

In this paper, a dynamic,visual attention model based on the rarity of features is proposed. We introduce the Incremental Coding Length (ICL) to measure,the perspective en- tropy gain of each feature. The objective of our model is to maximize the entropy of the sampled visual features. In order to optimize energy consumption, the limit amount,of energy of the system is re-distributed amongst features accord- ing to their Incremental Coding Length. By selecting features with large coding length increments, the computational system can achieve attention selectivity in both static and dynamic,scenes. We demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy in comparison,to mainstream,approaches in static saliency map generation. Moreover, we also show that our model captures several less-reported dynamic visual search behaviors, such as attentional swing and inhibition of re- turn.",

IdeaPanel enables users to sketch the target image in their minds and also supports tagging to describe their intentions. After a search is triggered, similar images will be returned in real time, based on which users can interactively refine their query sketches until ideal images are returned. Different from existing work, most of which requires a huge amount of memory for indexing and matching, IdeaPanel can achieve very competitive performance but requires much less memory storage. IdeaPanel needs only about 240MB memory to index 1.3M images (less than 3% of previous MindFinder system). Due to its high accuracy and low memory cost, IdealPanel can scale up to much larger database and thus has larger potential to return the most desired images for users.",

However, in a motor imagery based BCI-FES rehabilitation system, stroke patients usually are not able to conduct correct motor imagery like healthy people due to the injury of motor cortex. Therefore, motor imagery EEG of stroke patients lacks of specific discriminant features as appearances of healthy people, which significantly blocks CSP to seek the optimal projection subspace. In this paper, a method, which filters EEG into a variety of bands and improves performance through boosting principle based on a set of weak CSP-SVM classifiers, was proposed to solve the problem mentioned above and was evaluated on the EEG datasets of three stroke subjects. The proposed method outperformed the traditional CSP-SVM method in terms of classification accuracy. From data analysis, we observed that optimal spectral band for classification had been changing along with rehabilitation training, which may reveal mechanisms that dominant frequency band may be changed along with rehabilitation training and spectral power distribution may be changed in different stages of rehabilitation. In addition, this work also demonstrated the feasibility of our SJTU-BCMI BCI-FES rehabilitation training system.",

In this method, human body is described as three-dimensional skeletons.

Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is used as classification scheme. The HMM models are trained by sequences extracted from the CMU graphics lab motion capture database 1. This method is invariant to scale, coordinate system and transition. A system is implemented to recognize 4 different types of actions (walk, run, jump and jumping jack) both on the dataset of CMU and Weizmann[7]. Each video clip contains a single action type.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel generative model for natural image representation and scene classification. Given a natural image, it is decomposed with learned holistic basis called scene gist components. This gist representation is a global and adaptive image descriptor, generatively including most essential information related to visual perception. Meanwhile prior knowledge for scene category is integrated in the generative model to interpret the newly input image. To validate the efficiency of the scene gist representation, a simple nonparametric scene classification algorithm is developed based on minimizing the scene reconstruction error. Finally comparison with other scene classification algorithm is given to show the higher performance of the proposed model.",

        "abstract": "Tensors (also called multiway arrays) are a generalization of vectors and matrices to higher dimensions based on multilinear algebra. The development of theory and algorithms for tensor decompositions (factorizations) has been an active area of study within the past decade, e.g., [1] and [2]. These methods have been successfully applied to many problems in unsupervised learning and exploratory data analysis. Multiway analysis enables one to effectively capture the multilinear structure of the data, which is usually available as a priori information about the data. Hence, it might provide advantages over matrix factorizations by enabling one to more effectively use the underlying structure of the data. Besides unsupervised tensor decompositions, supervised tensor subspace regression and classification formulations have been also successfully applied to a variety of fields including chemometrics, signal processing, computer vision, and neuroscience.",

Even in a complicated scene, as long as the object's contour is most salient in the target image, the system is still able to capture it and lists the image in the retrieval results. Therefore, the system has better retrieval rate than existing systems and algorithms. One typical application of the proposed system is to help the computer understand what does the user draw or upload. It is based on the statistical distributions of tags of retrieved images, and the proposed system feeds back some candidate tags related to the query image. Such tags could be used for further retrieval to refine the result list. In addition, the system provides a friendly interactive interface with multiple queries. These queries are from different combinations of tags, a hand-drawn sketch and a natural image, and could help users search images flexibly and conveniently. The system runs on a database of 1.3 million images and could achieve a real-time retrieval speed. The results in the demonstration show excellent retrieval performance of the proposed system.",

We propose a computational model for perceiving head poses based on the Non-negative Multi-way Factorization (NMWF). The model consists of three components: the tensor representation for multi-view faces, feature selection and head pose perception. To find the facial representation basis, the NMWF algorithm is applied to the training data of facial images. The face tensor includes three factors of facial images, poses, and people. The former two factors are used to construct the computational model for pose estimation. The discriminative measure for perceiving the head pose is defined by the similarity between tensor basis and the representation of testing facial image which is projection of faces on the subspace spanned by the basis \"TensorFaces\". Computer simulation results show that the proposed model achieved satisfactory accuracy for estimating head poses of facial images in the CAS-PEAL face database.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we target at the problem of offline sketch parsing, in which the temporal orders of strokes are unavailable. It is more challenging than most of existing work, which usually leverages the temporal information to reduce the search space. Different from traditional approaches in which thousands of candidate groups are selected for recognition, we propose the idea of shapeness estimation to greatly reduce this number in a very fast way. Based on the observation that most of hand-drawn shapes with well-defined closed boundaries can be clearly differentiated from nonshapes if normalized into a very small size, we propose an efficient shapeness estimation method. A compact feature representation as well as its efficient extraction method is also proposed to speed up this process. Based on the proposed shapeness estimation, we present a three-stage cascade framework for offline sketch parsing. The shapeness estimation technique in this framework greatly reduces the number of false positives, resulting in a 96.2% detection rate with only 32 candidate group proposals, which is two orders of magnitude less than existing methods. Extensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed framework over stateof-the-art works on sketch parsing in both effectiveness and efficiency, even though they leveraged the temporal information of strok.",

However, there are still quite a few restrictions on users in present video conference systems. e. g. a user has to keep paying attention to a computer system. One important approach to further improve the system is to develop a better mode of human computer interaction. The Multi-modal Machine Attention Technology, based on bionics, is introduced. By integrating and synchronizing multi-modal information includingvideo and audio signals, we realize the technology, which can automatically trace a speaker in a conference ?focus the attention of an artificial system on anyobject of interest, such as the face of a speaker and his speech, and display the concerned object with a proper ratio in the center of pictures to equally attract the audience in the remote conference. The improved human computer interaction reduces the restrictions on speakers.",

However, very unfortunately basically all objective functions of algorithms in the tensor space are non-convex. However, sub-problems constructed by fixing all the modes but one are often convex and very easy to solve. However, this method may lead to difficulty converging; iterative algorithms sometimes get stuck in a local minimum and have difficulty converging to the global solution. Here, we propose a computational framework for constrained and unconstrained tensor methods. Using our methods, the algorithm convergence situation can be improved to some extent and better solutions obtained.

Up to now, a majority of BCI systems are developed to restore communication ability or movement functionality for people with severe disabilities, especially for paralyzed patients. To our best knowledge, other researchers haven't developed a multi-person BCI with competitive mode. Therefore, in this paper, we introduced a multi-person car racing system, which allows more than one person to play game at the same time and they can compete with each other for the aim of first reaching destination. The reason of development of car racing system has two aspects. At one hand, we introduced BCI to entertainment industry and provided a prototype for entertainment. At the other hand, we proposed a competitive mode for BCI. According to practical evaluation, the results demonstrated that our proposed system achieved a good performance.",

        "abstract": "Motor imagery-based BCI-FES rehabilitation system has been proved to be effective in the treatment of movement function recovery. Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are commonly used in the feature extraction and classification of Two-classes motor imagery. However, motor imagery signals of stroke patients are irregular due to the damage of the specified brain area. Traditional CSP is not able to detect the optimal projection direction on such EEG data recorded from stroke patients under the interference of irregular patterns. In this paper, an adaptive CSP method is proposed to deal with these unknown irregular patterns. In the method, two models are trained and updated by using different subsets of the original data in every iteration procedure. The method is applied on the EEG datasets of several stroke subjects comparing with traditional CSP-SVM. The results also provide an evidence of the feasibility of our BCI-FES rehabilitation system. ? Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.",

Based on this generating process of the kernel , we observed that the distribution of the kernel obeys super-sparsity, as the natural images. Recent works mostly exploit various kinds of priors in their models, but focus on the the speed or a close-form formulation for convenience of mathematical calculation ignoring the intrinsic feature of the kernels and images. In this paper we propose a new model with super-sparse prior for the deblurring problem from one single image. Since the close-form formulation of this model doesn't exist, we use a look-up table trick to approximate the solution. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrate that our model with super-sparse prior can produce stable and high-quality results. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2013.",

        "abstract": "As for ECG auto-diagnosis, Classification accuracy is a vital factor for providing diagnosis decision support in remote ECG diagnosis. The final accuracy depends on ECG preprocessing process, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. However, different heart diseases are with different ECG wave shapes, in addition, there is large numbers of heart diseases, so it is hard to accurately extract cardiology features from diverse ECG wave forms. Also the extracted cardiology features are always with large error which to some extent influence the classification accuracy. To deal with these problems, we propose a feature extraction method of PCA and ICA approach. We calculate a adaptive basis with ICA and PCA for the given disease type ECG and extract the coefficients in the respect of trained basis which will be used as the classification features combined with cardiology features. To prevent the dimension disaster problem brought by the additional ICA and PCA feature, a minimal redundancy maximal relevance feature selection method is adapted to reduce the dimension of feature vector. Experiment shows that our method can effectively exclude the influence of not accurate cardiology features and greatly improve the classification accuracy for heart diseases.",

By carefully considering the basic principles of human perceptual organization, a real-time solution is presented to automatically segment a user's sketch during his/her drawing. First, a graph-based sketch segmentation algorithm is proposed to segment a cluttered sketch into multiple parts based on the factor of proximity. Then, to improve the ability of detecting semantically meaningful objects, a semantic-based approach is introduced to simulate the past experience in the perceptual system by leveraging a web-scale clipart database. Finally, other important factors learnt from past experience, such as similarity, symmetry, direction, and closure, are also taken into account to make the approach more robust and practical. The proposed sketch segmentation framework has ability to handle complex sketches with overlapped objects. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework and algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a measurable window looking into brain dynamics. Brain activities may exhibit different representations while executing different cognitive tasks, which can be recognized by decoding EEG. This is crucial for constructing a brain\u2013computer interface (BCI), which directly bridges between the human brain and external experiments or devices for communication or function restoration. This paper proposed a mask-based approach integrating time-frequency mask (TFM) and connectivity mask (CM) to improve BCI performance. The TFM method does not require the discriminative time-frequency points to be centralized together as the specific-frequency\u2013specific-time (SFST) method does. It can also achieve good performance when discriminative features are scattered. Moreover, this paper also developed a CM method in the spatial domain to extract interchannel connectivity features. The performance of these methods was quantitatively evaluated on three datasets involving different cognitive tasks: 1) a pointing movement dataset; 2) a self-paced finger-tapping dataset in BCI competition II; and 3) a slow cortical potential dataset in BCI competition II. Empirical results of this paper showed that the TFM method outperformed the SFST method on all three datasets and achieved comparable performance to the winning methods in the two BCI competition datasets. The performance was further improved by combining TFM and CM, exceeding that of the winning methods in the BCI competition datasets.",

The candidate regions are detected through the trained RPN. Then we obtain the region-wise convolutional feature maps (CFMs) by forwarding them through a ROI pooling layer. Our feature encoding representation builds on the common sense that similar patterns have similar activations on feature maps. The target object is regarded as a combination of several meaningful patterns. In this way, we represent an image with the combination of encoded descriptors corresponding to the subsets of the proposed region. We also implement reranking algorithm to refine the proposed region in local retrieval.

        "abstract": "Automatic clothing recommendation grows dramatically due to the booming of apparel e-commerce. In this paper, we propose a novel clothing recommendation approach which is sensitive to the fashion trend. The proposed approach incorporates the expert knowledge into multiple dimensional information including purchase behaviors, image contents and product descriptions so as to provide recommendation of clothing in line with the forefront of fashion. Meanwhile, to meet with human visual aesthetics and user's collocation experience, we propose the integration of the convolutional neural network and the hierarchical collocation model (HCM) into our framework. The former is to extract effective visual features and attribute descriptors from the clothing items, while the latter embeds them into the concept of style topics which interpret the collocation pattern from a higher level of semantic knowledge. Such a data driven recommendation approach is able to learn clothing collocation metric from multi-dimensional clothing information. Experimental results show that our HCM method achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, it also ensures the fashion sensitivity of the recommended outfits.\n\n",

As we know, regions can be highlighted by labels through weakly-supervised segmentation algorithms, and deep features can be extracted from CNN convolutional layers. We develop a new approach to combine them, leading to simpler procedure with only one CNN forward pass and better interpretation. We apply this method to our database of over 100,000 clothing images, and achieve comparable results to the state of the art. Moreover, the part-based features support functionalities of tuning weights among the parts, and substituting visual part features from other clothes.

        "abstract": "In this paper, a tensor-based scheme is introduced for single trial electroencephalogram (EEG) classification in brain computer interfacing (BCI). Firstly, EEG signals are represented as third order tensors in the spatial-spectral-temporal domain by wavelet transform. Then, a regularized tensor discriminant analysis (RTDA) algorithm is proposed for a multi-way discriminative subspace extraction from tensor-represented EEG data. Unlike the conventional wavelet transform method, the proposed scheme includes the structural information in multi-channel time-varying EEG spectrums endorsed by tensor representation, and improves the performance for EEG classification. Compared with the common spatial pattern (CSP, the most successful algorithm in BCI) in the applications to two classes of datasets, the proposed scheme has the following advantages: (1) an optimal multi-way discriminative subspace can be extracted, obtaining significant spatial-spectral-temporal patterns for EEG classification; (2) the proposed scheme can identify discriminative characteristics robustly, and works well without prior neurophysiologic knowledge. This is a valuable property for developing new paradigms in BCI whose discriminative neural correlates are not known and (3) the proposed scheme is able to find the most significant channels for classification, and can be applied to channel selection in BCI. Computer simulations show that the number of used channels can be reduced to 2in two datasets with very little loss in performance. Therefore, it has great potential for the practical application of BCI.",

This may cause a loss of discriminative information for gait recognition, since different human parts vary in shape, movement constraints and so on. In this work, we devise an attention-based embedding network to address this problem. The attention module incorporated in our network assigns different saliency weights to different parts in feature maps at pixel level. The embedding network strives to embed gait features into low-dimensional latent space such that similarities can be simply measured by Euclidian distance. To achieve this goal, a combination of contrastive loss and triplet loss is utilized for training. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed network prevails over the state-of-the-art works on both OULP and MVLP dataset under cross-view conditions. Notably, we achieve 6.4(%) rank-1 recognition accuracy improvement under 90(^{circ }) angular difference on MVLP and 3.6(%) under 30(^{circ }) angular difference on OULP.",

        "abstract": "Object detection in still images has been extensively investigated recent years. But object detection in videos is still a challenging research topic. Directly using those methods for still images in videos would suffer from blurring and low resolution in video images. Some methods utilized the temporal information to boost the detection accuracy, but they are usually expensive in time in estimating optical flow. In this paper, we propose Recurrent RetinaNet, a flexible end-to-end approach for object detection in videos. In this work, a backbone network is leveraged to generate several feature maps, then a feature pyramid network extracts pyramid features from the feature maps. Detection boxes are generated according to the shapes of pyramid features. Two subnets with convolutional layers and Convolutional LSTM layers, are added on the top for box regression and classification. Note that the boxes are generated regardless of the content of images, there may be an extreme foreground-background imbalance. Thus, focal loss, which has been shown effective in object detection on images, is employed as the loss function for the classification subnet. Experiments show that the approach improves the detection accuracy and avoids the detection loss of some objects in some cases compared to RetinaNet and the model complexity is still good enough for real-time applications.",

This system of classification is comprised of three components including data preprocessing, feature extraction and classification of ECG signals. Two different feature extraction methods are applied together to obtain the feature vector of ECG data. The wavelet transform is used to extract the coefficients of the transform as the features of each ECG segment. Simultaneously, autoregressive modelling (AR) is also applied to obtain the temporal structures of ECG waveforms. Then the support vector machine (SVM) with Gaussian kernel is used to classify different ECG heart rhythm. Computer simulations are provided to verify the performance of the proposed method. From computer simulations, the overall accuracy of classification for recognition of 6 heart rhythm types reaches 99.68%",

        "abstract": "Applications based on electrocardiogram (ECG) signal feature extraction and classification are of major importance to the autodiagnosis of heart diseases. Most studies on ECG classification methods have targeted only 1- or 2-lead ECG signals. This limitation results from the unavailability of real clinical 12-lead ECG data, which would help train the classification models. In this study, we propose a new tensor-based scheme, which is motivated by the lack of effective feature extraction methods for direct tensor data input. In this scheme, an ECG signal is represented by third-order tensors in the spatial-spectral-temporal domain after using short-time Fourier transform on the raw ECG data. To overcome the limitations of tensor rank one discriminant analysis (TR1DA) inherited from linear discriminant analysis, we introduced a generalized tensor rank one discriminant analysis (GTR1DA). This approach involves considering the distribution of the data points near the classification boundary to calculate better projection tensors. The experimental results showed that the proposed method achieves greater classification accuracy than other vector- and tensor-based methods. Finally, GTR1DA features a better convergence property than the original TR1DA.",

As we know, a number of factors are likely to affect separation results in practical applications, such as the number of active sources, the distribution of source signals, and noise. The purpose of this paper to develop a general framework of blind separation from a practical point of view with special emphasis on the activation function adaptation. First, we propose the exponential generative model for probability density functions. A method of constructing an exponential generative model from the activation functions is discussed. Then, a learning algorithm is derived to update the parameters in the exponential generative model. The learning algorithm for the activation function adaptation is consistent with the one for training the demixing model. Stability analysis of the learning algorithm for the activation function is also discussed. Both theoretical analysis and simulations show that the proposed approach is universally convergent regardless of the distributions of sources. Finally, computer simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of the approach.",

With this approach, we decompose a doubly finite impulse response filter into a cascade form of two filters: a causal finite impulse response (FIR) filter and an anticausal FIR filter. After introducing a Lie group to the manifold of FIR filters, we discuss geometric properties of the FIR filter manifold. Using the nonholonomic transform, we derive the natural gradient on the FIR manifold. By simplifying the mutual information rate, we present a very simple cost function for blind deconvolution of nonminimum-phase systems. Subsequently, the natural gradient algorithms are developed both for the causal FIR filter and for the anticausal FIR filter.

In contrary to existing works that aggregate single frames features by time series model such as recurrent neural network, in this paper, we propose an interpretable reinforcement learning based approach to this problem. Particularly, we train an agent to verify a pair of images at each time. The agent could choose to output the result (same or different) or request another pair of images to verify (unsure). By this way, our model implicitly learns the difficulty of image pairs, and postpone the decision when the model does not accumulate enough evidence. Moreover, by adjusting the reward for unsure action, we can easily trade off between speed and accuracy. In three open benchmarks, our method are competitive with the state-of-the-art methods while only using 3% to 6% images. These promising results demonstrate that our method is favorable in both efficiency and performance.",

In this work, we propose a causal related BCI-FES rehabilitation training platform, consisting top-down and bottom-up causal chains to achieve a better rehabilitation performance. We compare our system with a popular BCI-FES system on EEG data recorded from ten patients divided in two groups.

With BCI technique, people with disabilities do not have to communicate with external environment through traditional and natural pathways like peripheral nerves and muscles, and could achieve it only by their brain activities. In this paper, we designed an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based wheelchair which can be steered by users' own thoughts without any other involvements. We evaluated the feasibility of BCI-based wheelchair in terms of accuracies and real-world testing. The results demonstrate that our BCI wheelchair is of good performance not only in accuracy, but also in practical running testing in a real environment. This fact implies that people can steer wheelchair only by their thoughts, and may have a potential perspective in daily application for disabled people.",

However, in microbial communities, there are many species with unknown quantity and distribution so that majority of reads can be impossibly assembled together. To save such unnecessary computation detecting overlaps, we present a new method of feature extraction that can be used to group highly similar reads likely to be assembled into a genome. The basic idea is to define the dinucleotide as a state in a sequence which is viewed as Markov Chain, and the transition probabilities of the neighboring states constitutes sixteen-by-sixteen transition matrix. The matrix is used as the feature of a sequence and its reshaped 1-by-256 matrix is viewed as the input pattern of a classifier. Computer simulations verify that the method works well. \u00a9 2005 IEEE.",

A practical problem in stroke rehabilitation systems is that how to separate motor imagery patterns from electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. There is a sharp decline in performance of these systems when classical algorithms, such as Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), are directly applied on stroke patients.We propose a tensor-based scheme to detect motor imagery EEG patterns in spatial-spectral-temporal domain directly from multidimensional EEG constructed by wavelet transform method. Discriminative motor imagery EEG patterns are obtained by Fisher score strategy. Furthermore, the most contributed channel groups and frequency bands are selected from these patterns and utilized as prior knowledge for the following motor imagery tasks.We evaluate our scheme based on EEG datasets recorded from stroke patients. The results show that our method outperforms five other traditional methods in both online and offline recognition performance.Unlike the existing methods, motor imagery EEG patterns in spatial-spectral-temporal domain are simultaneously obtained by our method, preserving the structural information of the multi-channel time-varying EEG.Our scheme is encouraged to be transferred to some other practical rehabilitation applications for its better performance.",

        "abstract": "Studies show that motor imagery based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems can be utilized therapeutically in stroke rehabilitation. Efficient decoding of subjectsu0027 motor intentions is essential in BCI-based rehabilitation systems to manipulate a neural prosthesis or other devices for motor relearning. However, due to cortical reorganization, the desynchro-nization potential evoked by the motor imagery of patients with brain lesions is quite different from that evoked by the motor imagery of normal subjects. These differences can be attributed to active cortex regions, frequency bands and amplitude. In this paper, we use a deep learning method to explore the EEG patterns of key channels and the frequency band for stroke patients. The EEG data is bandpass filtered into multiple sub-bands split by a sliding window strategy. Under these sub-bands, diverse spatial-spectral features are extracted and fed into a deep neural network for classification, uncovering the spectral patterns (bandpass filters) and spatial patterns (spatial weights). Experimental results from five stroke patients show that our method has higher classification accuracy than several state-of-the-art approaches. By tracking gradual changes in EEG patterns during rehabilitation, we try to uncover the neurophysiological plasticity mechanism in the impaired cortexes of stroke patients.",

        "abstract": "\n This chapter answers some interesting questions on China\u2019s foreign reserve holdings: Are they excessive? Why so much? How\n to invest them? We first use the popular reserve adequacy measures to examine if China\u2019s foreign reserve holdings are excessive.\n All the exercises suggest that China is holding too much reserves. We then analyze the motive of reserve holdings from a new\n aspect: foreign reserve holdings could be self-augmented. We also investigate the problem of how to set up a better portfolio\n for foreign reserve investment. The simulation in our model suggests that if foreign reserves are used to hedge against potential\n macroeconomic risks, it may raise the social utility by 56%.\n \n ",

        "abstract": "Previous research found that social rejection leads to increased aggression. How can this aggressive behaviour be prevented? Four experiments demonstrate that reminders of social activity reduce aggression after social exclusion. A brief, friendly social connection with an experimenter (versus a neutral interaction) reduced aggression after social rejection. A traditional mood induction had no effect on aggressive behaviour, showing that an activity must be social to be effective. Participants who wrote about a family member, a friend or a favourite celebrity were also not aggressive after rejection. The effect was mediated by trust in other people but not by state self-esteem or mood. Rejected participants who have an alternative source of social connection eschew the increased aggression usually displayed after social exclusion.",

        "abstract": "Cellulases can be engineered with enhanced properties for broad use in scientific and industrial applications. In this study, the wild-type cbh2 gene of the thermophilic fungus Chaetomium thermophilum encoding cellobiohydrolase II (CBHII) was mutagenized through in vitro directed evolution. The resulting Pichia pastoris yeast library was screened, and two transformants were selected for enhanced CBHII activities that were not attributed to increased gene copy numbers. The optimum fermentation times of the two mutant transformants were shortened to 4-5 days after methanol induction compared to 6 days for the wild-type. The optimum reaction temperature (60 \u00b0C) and pH level (5 or 6) of the mutant CBHII proteins, designated CBHIIX16 and CBHIIX305, were higher than those of wild-type CBHII (50 \u00b0C and pH 4). Kept at 80 \u00b0C for 1 h, CBHIIX16 and CBHIIX305 retained >50% of their activities, while the wild-type CBHII lost all activity. Sequence analysis of CBHIIX16 and CBHIIX305 revealed that they contained five and six mutated amino acids, respectively. Structural modeling confirmed the presence of carbohydrate binding type-1 and catalytic domains, where the hydrogen bond numbers between the 227th and 203rd amino acids were increased, which perhaps contributed to the elevated enzyme stability. Therefore, the two CBHII mutants selected for increased enzymatic activities also demonstrated elevated optimum reaction temperature and pH levels and enhanced thermal stability. These properties may be beneficial in practical applications for CBHII.",

        "abstract": "The rate of gene duplication is an important parameter in the study of evolution, but the influence of gene conversion and technical problems have confounded previous attempts to provide a satisfying estimate. We propose a new strategy to estimate the rate that involves separate quantification of the rates of two different mechanisms of gene duplication and subsequent combination of the two rates, based on their respective contributions to the overall gene duplication rate.Previous estimates of gene duplication rates are based on small gene families. Therefore, to assess the applicability of this to families of all sizes, we looked at both two-copy gene families and the entire genome. We studied unequal crossover and retrotransposition, and found that these mechanisms of gene duplication are largely independent and account for a substantial amount of duplicated genes. Unequal crossover contributed more to duplications in the entire genome than retrotransposition did, but this contribution was significantly less in two-copy gene families, and duplicated genes arising from this mechanism are more likely to be retained. Combining rates of duplication using the two mechanisms, we estimated the overall rates to be from approximately 0.515 to 1.49 x 10(-3) per gene per million years in human, and from approximately 1.23 to 4.23 x 10(-3) in mouse. The rates estimated from two-copy gene families are always lower than those from the entire genome, and so it is not appropriate to use small families to estimate the rate for the entire genome.We present a novel strategy for estimating gene duplication rates. Our results show that different mechanisms contribute differently to the evolution of small and large gene families.",

        "abstract": "The notion that gene duplications generating new genes and functions is commonly accepted in evolutionary biology. However, this assumption is more speculative from theory rather than well proven in genome-wide studies. Here, we generated an atlas of the rate of copy number changes (CNCs) in all the gene families of ten animal genomes. We grouped the gene families with similar CNC dynamics into rate pattern groups (RPGs) and annotated their function using a novel bottom-up approach. By comparing CNC rate patterns, we showed that most of the species-specific CNC rates groups are formed by gene duplication rather than gene loss, and most of the changes in rates of CNCs may be the result of adaptive evolution. We also found that the functions of many RPGs match their biological significance well. Our work confirmed the role of gene duplication in generating novel phenotypes, and the results can serve as a guide for researchers to connect the phenotypic features to certain gene duplications.",

Here we examined the patterns of retrogene distribution in 8 mammalian genomes using 4 non-mammalian genomes as a contrast. There has been a burst of young retrogenes not only in primate lineages as suggested in a recent study, but also in other mammalian lineages. In mammals, most of the retrofamilies (the gene families that have retrogenes) are shared between species. In these shared retrofamilies, 14%-18% of functional retrogenes may have originated independently in multiple mammalian species. Notably, in the independently originated retrogenes, there is an enrichment of ribosome related gene function. In sharp contrast, none of these patterns hold in non-mammals. Our results suggest that the recruitment of the specific L1 retrotransposons in mammals might have been an important evolutionary event for the split of mammals and non-mammals and retroposition continues to be an important active process in shaping the dynamics of mammalian genomes, as compared to being rather inert in non-mammals.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in DNA have been traditionally thought of as functionally unimportant and have been studied mainly as genetic markers. A recent handful of studies have shown, however, that SSRs in different positions of a gene can play important roles in determining protein function, genetic development, and regulation of gene expression. We have performed a detailed comparative study of the distribution of SSRs in the sequenced genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana and rice. RESULTS: SSRs in different genic regions - 5'untranslated region (UTR), 3'UTR, exon, and intron - show distinct patterns of distribution both within and between the two genomes. Especially notable is the much higher density of SSRs in 5'UTRs compared to the other regions and a strong affinity towards trinucleotide repeats in these regions for both rice and Arabidopsis. On a genomic level, mononucleotide repeats are the most prevalent type of SSRs in Arabidopsis and trinucleotide repeats are the most prevalent type in rice. Both plants have the same most common mononucleotide (A/T) and dinucleotide (AT and AG) repeats, but have little in common for the other types of repeats. CONCLUSION: Our work provides insight into the evolution and distribution of SSRs in the two sequenced model plant genomes of monocots and dicots. Our analyses reveal that the distributions of SSRs appear highly non-random and vary a great deal in different regions of the genes in the genomes.",

        "abstract": "Tandemly arrayed genes (TAGs) account for about one third of the duplicated genes in eukaryotic genomes, yet there has not been any systematic study of their gene expression patterns. Taking advantage of recently published large-scale microarray data sets, we studied the expression divergence of 361 two-member TAGs in human and 212 two-member TAGs in mouse and examined the effect of sequence divergence, gene orientation, and chromosomal proximity on the divergence of TAG expression patterns. Our results show that there is a weak negative correlation between sequence divergence of TAG members and their expression similarity. There is also a weak negative correlation between chromosomal proximity of TAG members and their expression similarity. We did not detect any significant relationship between gene orientation and expression similarity. We also found that downstream TAG members do not show significantly narrower expression breadth than upstream members, contrary to what we predict based on TAG expression divergence hypothesis that we propose. Finally, we show that both chromosomal proximity and expression correlation in TAGs do not differ significantly from their neighboring non-TAG gene pairs, suggesting that tandem duplication is unlikely to be the cause for the higher-than-random expression association between neighboring genes on a chromosome in human and mouse.",

        "abstract": "Tandemly arrayed genes (TAGs) play an important functional and physiological role in the genome. Most previous studies have focused on individual TAG families in a few species, yet a broad characterization of TAGs is not available. Here we identified all TAGs in the genomes of humans, mouse, and rat and performed a comprehensive analysis of TAG distribution, TAG sizes, TAG orientations and intergenic distances, and TAG functions. TAGs account for about 14-17% of all genes in the genome and nearly one-third of all duplicated genes, highlighting the predominant role that tandem duplication plays in gene duplication. For all species, TAG distribution is highly heterogeneous along chromosomes and some chromosomes are enriched with TAG forests, whereas others are enriched with TAG deserts. The majority of TAGs are of size 2 for all genomes, similar to the previous findings in Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Oryza sativa, suggesting that it is a rather general phenomenon in eukaryotes. The comparison with the genome patterns shows that TAG members have a significantly higher proportion of parallel gene orientation in all species, corroborating Graham's claim that parallel orientation is the preferred form of orientation in TAGs. Moreover, TAG members with parallel orientation tend to be closer to each other than all neighboring genes in the genome with parallel orientation. The analyses of Gene Ontology function indicate that genes with receptor or binding activities are significantly overrepresented by TAGs. Computer simulation reveals that random gene rearrangements have little effect on the statistics of TAGs for all genomes. Finally, the average proportion of TAGs shows a trend of increase with the increase of family sizes, although the correlation between TAG proportions in individual families and family sizes is not significant.",

        "abstract": "Tandemly arrayed genes (TAGs) are duplicated genes that are linked as neighbors on a chromosome, many of which have important physiological and biochemical functions. Here we performed a survey of these genes in 11 available vertebrate genomes. TAGs account for an average of about 14% of all genes in these vertebrate genomes, and about 25% of all duplications. The majority of TAGs (72-94%) have parallel transcription orientation (i.e., they are encoded on the same strand) in contrast to the genome, which has about 50% of its genes in parallel transcription orientation. The majority of tandem arrays have only two members. In all species, the proportion of genes that belong to TAGs tends to be higher in large gene families than in small ones; together with our recent finding that tandem duplication played a more important role than retroposition in large families, this fact suggests that among all types of duplication mechanisms, tandem duplication is the predominant mechanism of duplication, especially in large families. Finally, several species have a higher proportion of large tandem arrays that are species-specific than random expectation.",

        "abstract": "A stepwise carbochlorination-chemical vapor transport (SC-CVT) process is proposed for the rare earth extraction and separation\n from a mixed bastnaesite-monazite concentrate based on thermodynamic and kinetic analysis using carbon as reductant, chlorine\n gas as chlorination agent, SiCl4 as defluorination agent, and AlCl3 as vapor complex former. Between 500 C and 800 C, apparent activation energy of the carbochlorination within 2 hours changed\n from 22 to 16 kJ/mol roughly for the initial half hour and final 1 hour, respectively, in the absence of SiCl4; but these values reduced to 15 and 2.1 kJ/mole under 2 kPa of SiCl4 gas. The rare earth chloride yield for 2 hours was 56 to 88 mol pct in the absence of SiCl4 and 92 to 99 mol pct in the presence of SiCl4; but carbochlorination at above 1000 C yielded a large amount of acid-insoluble residue. This, together with the negligible\n equilibrium vapor pressure of ThCl4 at below 600 C, suggests that carbochlorination of the mixed concentrate at temperatures as low as 500 C in the (Cl2 + SiCl4) atmosphere is suitable for rare earth extraction and thorium-free volatile by-product release, which is different from the\n conventional Goldschmidt process at 1000 C to 1200 C. The CVT reaction of the carbochlorination product was performed at\n 800 C for 0.5 hours in the (Cl2 + SiCl4 + AlCl3) atmosphere and then at 1000 C for 6 hours in the (Cl2 + AlCl3) atmosphere along different temperature gradients, leading to complete thorium removal and efficient rare earth separation,\n respectively. Their combination allows an efficient and environmentally conscious extraction and separation of rare earth\n elements from the mixed concentrate.",

        "abstract": "A stepwise carbochlorination-chemical vapor transport-oxidation process is developed for the green rare earth extraction from\n a bastnaesite concentrate using carbon as reductant, chlorine gas as chlorination agent, SiCl4 gas as defluorination agent, AlCl3 as vapor complex former, and (O2+H2O) mixed gas as oxidant. Between 500 C and 800 C, the apparent activation energy of the carbochlorination within 2 hours\n changed from 17 to 10 kJ/mole roughly for the initial 20 minutes and final 1.5 hours, respectively, in the absence of SiCl4, but these values reduced to 15 and 5.9 kJ/mole under 10 kPa of SiCl4 gas, while the rare earth chloride conversion for 2 hours was 43 to 81 mol pct in the absence of SiCl4 and 55 to 99 mol pct under 10 kPa of SiCl4 gas. After carbochlorination at 550 C for 2 hours in the (Cl2+SiCl4) atmosphere for efficient rare earth extraction and thorium-free volatile by-product release, throium was removed by chemical\n vapor transport at 800 C for 0.5 hours in the (Cl2+SiCl4+AlCl3) atmosphere and alkaline earths were separated from rare earths by oxidation at 700 C to 1000 C in the (O2+H2O) atmosphere for 0.5 hours, followed by water leaching at room temperature. Their combination allows a clean and efficient\n rare earth extraction from the concentrate.",

        "abstract": "The effects of the processing conditions on the formation of buried oxide precipitates in He and O co-implanted Si were investigated by the combination of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) absorption spectroscopy, depth-resolved positron annihilation Doppler spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Silicon wafers were implanted with 50 keV He ions at a fluence of 2 \u00d7 1016 cm-2 and subsequent 150 keV O ions at a fluence of 2 \u00d7 1017 cm-2. For comparison, reference Si wafers were only implanted with 150 keV O ions. The Si-O-Si stretching frequency increases while the peak width of the Si-O-Si stretching absorption band decreases with an increase in annealing temperature. After the same annealing, the peak width of the Si-O-Si stretching absorption band in the He and O co-implanted sample is significantly larger than that in the reference sample. Two kinds of vacancy-type defects are observed by positrons, i.e., vacancy-type defects and vacancy-oxygen complexes. The characteristic S values of vacancy-type defects and vacancy-type complexes in the He and O co-implanted sample are smaller than those of the reference sample. In addition, the thickness of the buried oxide layer in the He and O co-implanted sample is smaller than that in the reference sample. After annealing at 1473 K, the O content is larger in the He and O co-implanted sample compared to that in the reference sample. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Composites with embedded metal nanoparticles attract much interest due to their unique physical properties, which considerably depend on size and shape of the nanoparticles, and on interparticle distance and dispersity of these parameters. Crystal defects can have an effect on the nucleation of nanoparticles. In this paper, the effect of defects on the nucleation and growth of silver nanoparticles was investigated. Argon ions with kinetic energy of 110 keV were implanted into spinel crystals, to produce defects in the surface-near region, and silver ions were then implanted into the region rich in defects. UV-VIS spectroscopy and TEM were used to analyze the samples. It is found that the introduction of defects can enhance the nucleation of silver nanoparticles and mediate their size distribution, and that the size of these nanoparticles for the sample with argon pre-implantation is larger than that in the sample without argon pre-implantation. During an annealing process, defects can improve the growth efficiency of nanoparticles. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "Tailoring the size and distribution of Ag nanoparticles in silica glass by defects",
        "abstract": "The composites embedded with metallic nanoparticles show large nonlinear optical susceptibility and strong surface plasmon resonance absorption, which enable potential application in opto-electronics. Ion implantation has been proven to be a powerful technique of synthesis of metallic nanoparticles due to its versatility and compatibility. However, the synthesis of nanoparticles by ion implantation inevitably leads to a broad size distribution due to Ostwald ripening process. The broad size distribution has a negative effect on improving the figure of merits for nonlinear optics. In this paper, we tried to introduce defects in silica glass to act as pre-nucleation centers to mediate the size and distribution of Ag nanoparticles. In experiment, the silica glass samples were pre-irradiated by 200 keV Ar ions to fluences of 0.8, 2.0 and 5.0 \ufffd\ufffd 1016 ions/cm2, and then 200 keV Ag ions were implanted into the pre-irradiated samples to fluence of 2.0 \ufffd\ufffd 1016 ions/cm2. UV-VIS results show that the absorbance intensity of Ag SPR peak initially increases and then decreases with pre-irradiation fluence, which implies the change in size and density of Ag nanoparticles in samples. TEM results verify that Ag nanoparticles in the sample pre-irradiated to the fluence of 0.8 \ufffd\ufffd 1016 ions/cm2 grow bigger and distribute in a relatively narrow region comparing with that without pre-irradiation. With further increase of pre-irradiation fluence, the size of Ag nanoparticles shows a depth dependent distribution. A boundary can be clear seen at the depth of 110 nm, larger Ag nanoparticles disperse in region shallower than 110 nm, and smaller Ag nanoparticles disperse in the region deeper than 110 nm. The average size of Ag nanoparticles initially increases and then decreases with pre-irradiation fluence. Therefore, the introduction of defects by pre-irradiation could be an effective way to tailor the size and distribution of metallic nanoparticles in matrix. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "Surface change of gallium nitride specimens after bombardment by highly charged Pbq+-ions (q 25, 35) at room temperature is studied by means of atomic force microscopy. The experimental results reveal that the surface of GaN specimens is significantly etched and erased. An unambiguous step-up is observed. The erosion depth not only strongly depends on the charge state of ions, but also is related to the incident angle of Pbq+-ions and the ion dose. The erosion depth of the specimens in 60\u00b0 incidence (tilted incidence) is significantly deeper than that of the normal incidence. The erosion behaviour of specimens has little dependence on the kinetic energy of ion (Ek 360,700keV). On the other hand, surface roughness of the irradiated area is obviously decreased due to erosion compared with the un-irradiated area. A flat terrace is formed. \u00a9 2008 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "In the present work, a Cz-Silicon wafer is implanted with helium ions to produce a buried porous layer, and then thermally annealed in a dry oxygen atmosphere to make oxygen transport into the cavities. The formation of the buried oxide layer in the case of internal oxidation (ITOX) of the buried porous layer of cavities in the silicon sample is studied by positron beam annihilation (PBA). The cavities are formed by 15 keV He implantation at a fluence of 2 \u00d7 1016 cm-2 and followed by thermal annealing at 673 K for 30 min in vacuum. The internal oxidation is carried out at temperatures ranging from 1073 to 1473 K for 2 h in a dry oxygen atmosphere. The layered structures evolved in the silicon are detected by using the PBA and the thicknesses of their layers and nature are also investigated. It is found that rather high temperatures must be chosen to establish a sufficient flux of oxygen into the cavity layer. On the other hand high temperatures lead to coarsening the cavities and removing the cavity layer finally. \u00a9 2008 Chin. Phys. Soc. and IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "N-type GaN films bombarded with different highly charged 126Xeq+-ions (9 \u2264 q \u2264 30) at room temperature was studied by atomic force microscopy. The experimental results show that when q exceeds the threshold value 18, remarkable swelling turns into obvious erosion in the irradiated area. On the other hand, surface disorder of GaN films strongly depends on the charge state q of ions, incident angle and ion influence, and the damage behavior of films is unrelated to the kinetic energy within the scope of experimental parameters (180 keV \u2264 Ek \u2264 600 keV). For q=18, the surface morphology of the films almost does hot change at normal incidence, and at incidence angle of 30\u00b0 relative to the film surface, there appears small-scale swelling in irradiated region and a low step forms between the irradiated and un-irradiated regions. For q < 18, the film surface is capped with an amorphous layer, with increased roughness, distinct swelling. Moreover, especially at and near the boundaries, a series of remarkable sharp bumps like ridges are observed. And an evident step-up is formed between the irradiated and un-irradiated regions. The step is more remarkable for tilted incidence than normal incidence. For q > 18, film surface is etched, forming a deep dump with a high step with the increase of ions influence. Unambiguous indentations relevant to the ion influence on the step appear. Furthermore, the step height is proportional to the ion influence approximately and is much higher for tilted incidence than normal incidence. \u00a9 2009 Chin. Phys. Soc.",

The results show that highly charged ions can etch the sample surface obviously, and the GaN sample irradiated by highly charged ions has N depletion or is Ga rich on its surface. Besides, the relative content of Ga-Ga bond increases as the dose and charge state of the incident ions increase. In addition, the binding energy of Ga 3d5/2 electrons corresponding to Ga-Ga bond of the irradiated GaN sample is smaller compared with that of the Ga bulk material.

The samples were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Before and after annealing up to 600 \u00b0C, an amorphous layer is formed but Ar bubbles are not observed in the damage layer. After annealing at 800 \u00b0C, argon bubbles are observed together with extended defects. The damage layer evolves into a polycrystalline structure. After annealing at 1100 \u00b0C; exfoliation occurs on the sample surface, and microtwin lamellas form in the damage layer.

        "abstract": "Specimens of silicon carbide (6H-SiC) were irradiated with 5 MeV Kr ions (84Kr19+) for three fluences of 5\u00d71013, 2 \u00d71014 and 1\u00d7 1015 ions/cm2, and subsequently annealed at room temperature, 500\u00b0C, 700\u00b0C and 1000\u00b0C, respectively. The strain of the specimens was investigated with high resolution XRD and different defect evolution processes are revealed. An interpretation of the defect evolution and migration is given to explain the strain variation. The mechanical properties of the specimens were studied by using a nano-indentation technique in continuous stiffness measurement (GSM) mode with a diamond Berkovich indenter. For specimens irradiated with fluences of 5\u00d710 13 or 2\u00d71014 ions/cm2, hardness values exceed that of un-implanted SiC. However, hardness sharply degrades for specimens irradiated with the highest fluence of 1\u00d71015 ions/cm2. The specimens with fluences of 5\u00d71013 and 2\u00d71014 ions/cm2 and subsequently annealed at 700\u00b0C and 500\u00b0C, respectively, show the maximum hardness value. \u00a9 2011 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Magnesium aluminate spinel crystals (MgAl 2 O 4 (1 1 0)) deposited with 30 nm Cu film on surface were implanted with 110 keV Ar-ions to a fluence of 1.0 \u00d7 10 17 ions/cm 2 at 350 \u00b0C, and then annealed in vacuum condition at the temperature of 500, 600, 700, 800 and 900 \u00b0C for 1 h, respectively. Ultraviolet\u2013visible spectrometry (UV\u2013VIS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Rutherford backscattering (RBS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were adopted to analyze the specimens. After implantation, the appearance of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorbance peak in the UV\u2013VIS spectrum indicated the formation of Cu nanoparticles, and the TEM results for 500 \u00b0C also confirmed the formation of Cu nanoparticles at near-surface region. In annealing process, The SPR absorbance intensity increased at 500 and 700 \u00b0C, decreased with a blue shift of the peak position at 600 and 800 \u00b0C, and the peak disappeared at 900 \u00b0C. The SPR absorbance intensity evolution with temperature was discussed combined with other measurement results (RBS, SEM and TEM). Keywords Cu nanoparticles Surface plasmon resonance absorbance Defects 1 Introduction Synthesis of composites embedded with metallic nanoparticles has been given more attention in recent years [1\u20133] , due to their attractive property different from the bulk materials, such as the picosecond response of third order nonlinear susceptibility in optical materials [4] and improvement of speed for write and erase and low-power consumption in the nanofloating gate memory with metallic nanoparticles [5,6] . However, the problems that how to control the size, distribution and shape of metallic nanoparticles precisely [7] are not yet solved completely. Therefore, some novel synthesis methods have been developed, such as Sol\u2013Gel [8] , pulsed laser deposition [9] . In addition, there are some latest reports that nanoparticles distribution and size-uniformity can be mediated by defects in materials. For example, Patel et al. [10] used Ar-ions implantation to introduce defects in materials, and then deposited a thin metallic film on the as-implanted specimens\u2019 surface, finally carried out the Ar-ions irradiation to synthesis metallic nanoparticles; Zhou et al. [11] also used a similar method to synthesize nanoparticles, and the TEM micrographs indicated that uniform-size nanoparticles were synthesized at near-surface region; Giulian et al. [12] used 5 MeV Ge ions to bring defects into materials, and then carried out metallic ions implantation, which also formed nanoparticles with uniformed size in projectiles range from the TEM observation. In the present work, Ar-ions were used to bombard the specimens, which were deposited with thin metallic film on the surface, to bring defects and metallic atoms into materials simultaneously for synthesis nanoparticles. The influence of annealing on nanoparticles was studied. 2 Experimental (1 1 0) Plane-oriented specimens of single-crystal magnesium aluminate spinel (MgAl 2 O 4 ), deposited with 30 nm Cu film on the surface by magnetron sputtering, were implanted with 110 keV Ar-ions at 350 \u00b0C to a nominal fluence of 1.0 \u00d7 10 17 ions/cm 2 . During implantation the specimens were titled by 4\u00b0 to avoid channeling implantation. The as-implanted specimens were isochronally annealed in a vacuum condition of 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22123 Pa for 1 h at temperatures of 500, 600, 700, 800 and 900 \u00b0C, respectively. The ultraviolet\u2013visible spectrometry (UV\u2013VIS, PerkinElmer Lambda 900), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6701F) and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) techniques were adopted to analysis the specimens. In addition, some of the specimens were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JSM- 2010). RBS analysis was performed with 2.0 MeV He ions in an experimental terminal of a tandem accelerator at the National Key Laboratory of Heavy Ion Physics of Beijing University. The backscattered He ions were detected using a surface barrier detector installed at an angle 165\u00b0 from the incident direction. The cross-section specimens for TEM observation were prepared by mechanical milling firstly and then thinned by precision ion polishing system (Gatan model 691). 3 Results 3.1 UV\u2013VIS The results of UV\u2013VIS absorbance spectrum for all specimens are shown in Fig. 1 . It can be seen that an absorbance peak appears around 600 nm after implantation at 350 \u00b0C. The peak intensity increases after annealing at 500 and 700 \u00b0C, and decreases with a blue shift of the peak position after annealing at 600 and 800 \u00b0C. The peak disappears completely after annealing at 900 \u00b0C. In fact, the absorbance spectrum after Ar-ions implantation is a superposition curve, which comes from the absorbance for virgin spinel and Cu. After baseline correction, we can obtain the absorbance curve only for Cu, but the shape of the peak is asymmetrical, shown in Fig. 2 . Base on the absorbance curve after base line correction, the following formula can be used to estimate the nanoparticles average size [10] , D = v f \u03c0 c \u03bb 2 \u0394 \u03bb 1 / 2 where D is the nanoparticles average diameter, v f is the electron velocity corresponding to the Fermi energy of metal, c is the velocity of light, \u0394 \u03bb 1/2 is Full Wave at Half Maximum wavelength (FWHM) and \u03bb is peak wavelength. The estimated average diameter of Cu nanoparticles is 7.9 nm for the specimen annealed at 500 \u00b0C. 3.2 SEM and RBS The surface morphology and Cu distribution are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 , respectively. The SEM results indicate that Cu agglomeration occurs after implantation at elevated temperature (350 \u00b0C). With temperature increase, the Cu agglomeration becomes severe more and more; the Cu on the surface exists totally as micron-sized particles on surface after annealing at 900 \u00b0C. The flaking and exfoliation are also observed on the surface of spinel after annealing at 900 \u00b0C. The Cu agglomeration induces the change of Cu average thickness; this change makes the position of Al and O shift to higher channel numbers, widens Cu peak and also results in a low energy tail of the Cu peak in the RBS spectrum. The appearance of a low energy tail of Cu peak in RBS spectrum brings difficulties in distinguishing contributions of Cu on surface and Cu migrated into the specimen. However, we can obtain the Cu total amount evolution with temperature in annealing process according to the RBS spectrum. The Cu amount of as-implanted specimen decreases notably comparing with that of un-implanted specimen; this decrease of Cu amount is caused by sputtering of Ar-ions bombardment. The Cu amount almost is a constant in the temperature range of 500\u2013700 \u00b0C. However, it decreases obviously after annealing at 800 and 900 \u00b0C; this decrease of Cu amount is mainly induced by evaporation at a higher temperature. 3.3 TEM Specimens annealed at 500 and 900 \u00b0C are analyzed by TEM, and the results are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 , respectively. From the TEM results for 500 \u00b0C, it can be known that the swelling occurs at some near-surface region after implantation and the swelling regions sustain amorphous state even after annealing at 500 \u00b0C. The crystal Cu nanoparticles, with size of 1.7\u20134.3 nm in diameter (the average diameter is 2.4 nm), are observed in the swelling amorphous regions, as shown in Fig. 5 . From the spinel surface down to the depth of 90 nm, the main defects are nanometer-sized cavities. In particular, at the depth about 25 nm there are a lot of micro-cracks, shown in Fig. 6 . It is co-existence of nanometer-sized cavities and interstitial clusters in the depth range of 90\u2013150 nm, however, there mainly are interstitial clusters in the depth range of 150\u2013225 nm. After annealing at 900 \u00b0C the defects recovery is pronounced, especially the amount of interstitial clusters reduces obviously in the depth range of 150\u2013225 nm. However, the micro-cracks appear in the region of 50\u2013150 nm in depth. At the depth about 25 nm, the exfoliation occurs at some region. However, there is no large number of Cu nanoparticles found at the un-exfoliation region. 4 Discussion For nanoparticles with diameters much smaller than the wavelength of light ( \u03bb ), the theories of Mie can be used to calculate the absorption coefficient (cm \u22121 ) of the composite [10,13] , a = 18 \u03c0 Qn 0 3 \u03bb \u03b5 2 ( \u03b5 1 + 2 n 0 2 ) 2 + \u03b5 2 2 where \u03b1 is the absorption coefficient of the composite, Q is the volume fraction of nanoparticles, n 0 is the refractive index of the matrix, \u03b5 1 and \u03b5 2 are the real and imaginary part of the dielectric constant of metal in bulk, respectively. Metallic nanoparticles exhibit surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorbance peak at a frequency \u03c9 p that is related to the refractive index n 0 of the surrounding medium according to Mie\u2019s theory as \u03b5 1 + 2 n 0 2 = 0 . Here it is assumed that the particles are optically isolated [10] . Therefore, the appearance of SPR peak around 600 nm in the UV\u2013VIS spectrum indicates the formation of Cu nanoparticles in the specimens, which is also confirmed by TEM results for the specimen annealed at 500 \u00b0C. However, the average diameter of Cu nanoparticles estimated from the absorbance spectrum of 500 \u00b0C (7.9 nm) is larger than that obtained from TEM observation (2.4 nm); this difference in average diameter of Cu nanoparticles is caused by Cu remained on surface. Thin metal film has a broad absorbance band in wavelength range of 500\u20131200 nm; the intensity of the absorbance band increases first and becomes saturated gradually [14] . Therefore, the absorbance spectrum after baseline correction still is a superposition absorbance curve from Cu nanoparticles in spinel and Cu on spinel surface; this causes the shift of peak position to larger wavelength and asymmetry of the peak shape, shown in Fig. 2 . In addition, it can also be seen from above formula it is linear relationship of absorbance intensity and nanoparticles volume fraction when other parameters are seen as constants. The Cu amount almost is a constant in the temperature range of 500\u2013700 \u00b0C. Therefore, the increase of absorbance intensity at 500 and 700 \u00b0C means more Cu nanoparticles formed, and the decrease of absorbance intensity at 600 \u00b0C means less Cu nanoparticles formed. The anomalous effect of SPR absorbance intensity at 600 \u00b0C has no relation with the Cu on surface. Because the decrease of SPR absorbance intensity after annealing at 600 \u00b0C is also observed for Ag nanoparticles in Ag-ions implanted spinel, for which there is no metallic film remained on surface (which is not published yet). It probably associates with vacancy-type defects migration. Ions implantation with low energy brings lots of interstitials and vacancies in materials. Generally, the recovery of these defects will go through five stages in annealing process [15] : (I) interstitials migration and combination with vacancies; (II) agglomeration of interstitials and formation of interstitial clusters; (III) vacancies migration and combination with interstitial clusters; (IV) agglomeration of vacancies and formation of vacancy clusters; (V) dissociation of vacancy clusters into single vacancies, which migrate and combine with interstitial clusters continuously. The TEM results for 500 \u00b0C indicate there are lots of interstitials clusters in depth range of 90\u2013225 nm, thus it is considered that the stage (I) and (II) described as above occur in spinel at the temperature lower than 500 \u00b0C. The TEM results for 900 \u00b0C show pronounced recovery of defects, appearance of micro-cracks in the depth range of 50\u2013150 nm and exfoliation at some near-surface region; these indicates the stage (III) and (IV) described as above occur in temperature range of 500\u2013900 \u00b0C. In the temperature range of 500\u2013700 \u00b0C, the Cu amount almost is a constant, but the SPR absorbance intensity decreases after annealing at 600 \u00b0C. Therefore, it is considered that the vacancy migration occurs at 600 \u00b0C (described as stage (III)). The vacancies migration and combination with interstitial clusters result in reduction of vacancy amount; this has a great influence on nanoparticles nucleation and induces decrease of nanoparticles volume fraction. However, when the temperature is higher than 600 \u00b0C, the vacancies clustering probably occurs instead of vacancies migration and combination with interstitial clusters. The vacancies clustering process would progress in a relatively broad temperature range, because lots of cavities and micro-cracks even exfoliation at near-surface region appear until the temperature reaching 900 \u00b0C. Therefore, the retained vacancies or vacancy clusters as Cu atoms nucleation centers induce Cu nanoparticles amount increase again at 700 \u00b0C. That the SPR absorbance intensity decreases with a blue shift of peak position after annealing at 800 \u00b0C probably associates with large number of Cu evaporation on surface at elevated temperature. Because the Cu remained on specimen\u2019s surface has contribution to the absorbance intensity of SPR peak. The disappearance of SPR peak after annealing at 900 \u00b0C probably has relation with exfoliation at near-surface region. The exfoliation depth is at about 25 nm, the Cu nanoparticles mainly locate in this depth region. However, Cu nanoparticles dissociation can not be excluded in the temperature range of 800\u2013900 \u00b0C, because Arai et al. observed Ag nanoparticles dissociation in amorphous silicon after annealing at 800 \u00b0C [16] , and we can not find large number of Cu nanoparticles at the un-exfoliated near-surface region after annealing at 900 \u00b0C. 5 Conclusion Magnesium aluminate spinel crystals deposited with 30 nm Cu on the surface were bombarded with 110 keV Ar-ions to a fluence of 1.0 \u00d7 10 17 ions/cm 2 at 350 \u00b0C. The appearance of SPR peak on the UV-VIS spectrum indicated the Cu nanoparticles formation. The TEM results for specimen annealed at 500 \u00b0C showed that Cu nanoparticles with an average diameter of 2.4 nm exist in near-surface region of spinel. On the basis of defects recovery process, the evolution of SPR absorbance intensity with annealing temperature was discussed. References [1] Z.H. Liu H.H. Wang Nucl. Instrum.

        "abstract": "Surface morphology, compositions, microstructure and optical properties of GaN film irradiated by highly charged Kr q+ (q\u00a0=\u00a023, 15, 11) in two geometries to a fluence of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01015 kr q+/cm2 were studied using AFM, XPS, PL, Raman scattering and UV\u2013visible spectroscopy. The AFM observation shows that the irradiated GaN area is a swollen terrace. The swelling rate increased with the charge state (potential energy). For the same charge state, the swelling rate of tilted incidence was greater than that for normal incidence. The XPS measurements reveal that N deficiency, Ga enrichment and Ga\u2013O and Ga dangling bonds generated on the irradiated GaN surface increased with the charge state, and more N was lost for normal incidence than that for tilted incidence. The UV\u2013Vis results show that the transmittance decreased with increasing charge state. For the same charge state, the transmittance for tilted incidence is higher than that for normal incidence. The PL spectra present that, with increasing charge state, the YL band intensity decreased, with a blueshift in its peak position; while the NBE peak intensity increased first and then reduced, and a blue luminescence band appeared. A rapid quenching of both the YL and the NEB for normal incidence was observed. Raman spectra display that screw dislocations perhaps were produced near the surface for normal incidence.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Microstructure characterizations of silicon carbide (SiC) fibers irradiated with 246.8-MeV Ar 16+  at different fluences were investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman scattering spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). TEM results reveal that 3C-SiC grains were surrounded by the carbon ribbons. The size of 3C-SiC grains first decreases and then increases with increasing ion fluence. Raman spectra display that SiC fiber consists of both 3C-SiC and abundant graphite phase. A redshift of the vibration mode of 3C-SiC in the fibers occured as compared with that of standard bulk 3C-SiC. Meanwhile, 4H-SiC phase was observed after irradiation. Furthermore, scattering intensity of all peaks in Raman spectra first reduces and then increases with increasing ion fluence, indicating that damage accumulates at low fluences and subsequently recovers to some extent at higher fluences. SEM results exhibit that the diameter of SiC fibers first shrinks and then expands, simultaneously, carbon concentration on fibers surface decreases while silicon concentration increases gradually, with increasing ion fluence, accompanied by an adsorption of oxygen.",

However, the joint effects of multiple variants in the same genes have been largely ignored due to their complexity or lack of data. This paper uses HMMvar, a hidden Markov model based approach, to investigate the combined effect of multiple variants from the 1000 Genomes Project. Two tumor suppressor genes, TP53 and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), are also studied for the joint effect of compensatory indel variants.",

We studied the relationship between seven diseases characterized in a previous genome-wide association study by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. Instead of doing a horizontal association of SNPs to diseases, we did a vertical analysis of disease associations by comparing the genetic similarities of diseases. Our analysis was carried out at four levels - the nucleotide level (SNPs), the gene level, the protein level (through protein-protein interaction network), and the phenotype level.Our results show that Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and type 1 diabetes share evidence of genetic associations at all levels of analysis, offering strong molecular support for the current grouping of the diseases. On the other hand, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes, despite being considered as a natural group with potential aetiological overlap, do not show any evidence of shared genetic basis at all levels.Our study is a first attempt on mining of GWA data to examine genetic associations between different diseases. The positive result is apparently not a coincidence and hence demonstrates the promising use of our approach.",

They are hypothesized to be an important part of every genome and have been shown to be evolutionarily conserved as well. Naturally, it is in our interest to develop a software for identifying antisense pairs. While a variety of approaches and software do exist, each approach has its limitations and the software is not meant for large-scale analyses for identifying both cis and trans antisense genes. Here we present a novel way to identify antisense genes and show the results we obtained through it. While in no means a perfect solution, we do manage to show a possible way that may lead to more accurate prediction of antisense genes.",

This method allows transitions between hidden states (defined as \"SNP,\" \"Ins,\" \"Del,\" and \"Match\") of adjacent genomic bases and determines an optimal hidden state path by using the Viterbi algorithm. The inferred hidden state path provides a direct solution to the identification of SNPs and INDELs. Simulation studies show that, under various sequencing depths, vi-HMM outperforms commonly used variant calling methods in terms of sensitivity and F score. When applied to the real data, vi-HMM demonstrates higher accuracy in calling SNPs and INDELs.",

        "title": "MSOAR 2.0: Incorporating tandem duplications into ortholog assignment based on genome rearrangement.",
        "abstract": "Ortholog assignment is a critical and fundamental problem in comparative genomics, since orthologs are considered to be functional counterparts in different species and can be used to infer molecular functions of one species from those of other species. MSOAR is a recently developed high-throughput system for assigning one-to-one orthologs between closely related species on a genome scale. It attempts to reconstruct the evolutionary history of input genomes in terms of genome rearrangement and gene duplication events. It assumes that a gene duplication event inserts a duplicated gene into the genome of interest at a random location (i.e., the random duplication model). However, in practice, biologists believe that genes are often duplicated by tandem duplications, where a duplicated gene is located next to the original copy (i.e., the tandem duplication model).In this paper, we develop MSOAR 2.0, an improved system for one-to-one ortholog assignment. For a pair of input genomes, the system first focuses on the tandemly duplicated genes of each genome and tries to identify among them those that were duplicated after the speciation (i.e., the so-called inparalogs), using a simple phylogenetic tree reconciliation method. For each such set of tandemly duplicated inparalogs, all but one gene will be deleted from the concerned genome (because they cannot possibly appear in any one-to-one ortholog pairs), and MSOAR is invoked. Using both simulated and real data experiments, we show that MSOAR 2.0 is able to achieve a better sensitivity and specificity than MSOAR. In comparison with the well-known genome-scale ortholog assignment tool InParanoid, Ensembl ortholog database, and the orthology information extracted from the well-known whole-genome multiple alignment program MultiZ, MSOAR 2.0 shows the highest sensitivity. Although the specificity of MSOAR 2.0 is slightly worse than that of InParanoid in the real data experiments, it is actually better than that of InParanoid in the simulation tests.Our preliminary experimental results demonstrate that MSOAR 2.0 is a highly accurate tool for one-to-one ortholog assignment between closely related genomes. The software is available to the public for free and included as online supplementary material.",

        "abstract": "With the development of sequencing technologies, more and more sequence variants are available for investigation. Different classes of variants in the human genome have been identified, including single nucleotide substitutions, insertion and deletion, and large structural variations such as duplications and deletions. Insertion and deletion (indel) variants comprise a major proportion of human genetic variation. However, little is known about their effects on humans. The absence of understanding is largely due to the lack of both biological data and computational resources.This paper presents a new indel functional prediction method HMMvar based on HMM profiles, which capture the conservation information in sequences. The results demonstrate that a scoring strategy based on HMM profiles can achieve good performance in identifying deleterious or neutral variants for different data sets, and can predict the protein functional effects of both single and multiple mutations.This paper proposed a quantitative prediction method, HMMvar, to predict the effect of genetic variation using hidden Markov models.

        "abstract": "Gene conversion, a non-reciprocal transfer of genetic information from one sequence to another, is a biological process whose importance in affecting both short-term and long-term evolution cannot be overemphasized. Knowing where gene conversion has occurred gives us important insights into gene duplication and evolution in general. In this paper we present an ensemble-based learning method for predicting gene conversions using two different models of reticulate evolution. Since detecting gene conversion is a rare-class problem, we implement cost-sensitive learning in the form of a generated cost matrix that is used to modify various underlying classifiers. Results show that our method combines the predictive power of different models and is able to predict gene conversion more accurately than any of the two studied models. Our work provides a useful framwork for future improvement of gene conversion predictions through multiple models of gene conversion.",

        "abstract": "The Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database uses a large number of hidden Markov models (HMMs) to represent families and superfamilies composed of proteins that presumably share the same evolutionary origin. However, how the HMMs are related to one another has not been examined before.In this work, taking into account the processes used to build the HMMs, we propose a working hypothesis to examine the relationships between HMMs and the families and superfamilies that they represent. Specifically, we perform an all-against-all HMM comparison using the HHsearch program (similar to BLAST) and construct a network where the nodes are HMMs and the edges connect similar HMMs. We hypothesize that the HMMs in a connected component belong to the same family or superfamily more often than expected under a random network connection model. Results show a pattern consistent with this working hypothesis. Moreover, the HMM network possesses features distinctly different from the previously documented biological networks, exemplified by the exceptionally high clustering coefficient and the large number of connected components.The current finding may provide guidance in devising computational methods to reduce the degree of overlaps between the HMMs representing the same superfamilies, which may in turn enable more efficient large-scale sequence searches against the database of HMMs.",

Fisher's model in one dimension admits a closed form solution for this expected fitness effect. A combination of different parameters, including the distribution of mutation lengths, population sizes, and the initial state that the population is in, are examined to see how they affect the expected fitness effect of state transitions. The results show that the expected fitness change due to the fixation of a mutation is always positive, regardless of the distributional shapes of mutation lengths, effective population sizes, and the initial state that the population is in. The further away the initial state of a population is from the optimal state, the slower the population returns to the optimal state. Effective population size (except when very small) has little effect on the expected fitness change due to mutation fixation. The always positive expected fitness change suggests that small populations may not necessarily be doomed due to the runaway process of fixation of deleterious mutations.",

Next, we remove genes with zero loading elements across all samples (normal and disease) and extract as \"feature genes\". The feature genes are essentially genes that contribute differentially to variations in normal and disease samples and thus can be used as features for classification. We apply our method to two commonly used microarray data to select feature genes, and use the linear support vector machine to evaluate the performance of our algorithm.

        "abstract": "Numerous tools have been developed to predict the fitness effects (i.e., neutral, deleterious, or beneficial) of genetic variants on corresponding proteins. However, prediction in terms of whether a variant causes the variant bearing protein to lose the original function or gain new function is also needed for better understanding of how the variant contributes to disease/cancer. To address this problem, the present work introduces and computationally defines four types of functional outcome of a variant: gain, loss, switch, and conservation of function. The deployment of multiple hidden Markov models is proposed to computationally classify mutations by the four functional impact types.The functional outcome is predicted for over a hundred thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) mutations, as well as cancer related mutations in oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. The results show that the proposed computational method is effective in fine grained prediction of the functional outcome of a mutation, and can be used to help elucidate the molecular mechanism of disease/cancer causing mutations. The program is freely available at http://bioinformatics.cs.vt.edu/zhanglab/HMMvar/download.php .This work is the first to computationally define and predict functional impact of mutations, loss, switch, gain, or conservation of function. These fine grained predictions can be especially useful for identifying mutations that cause or are linked to cancer.",

        "abstract": "Curation of antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) databases is a labor-intensive process that requires expert knowledge to manually collect, correct, and/or annotate individual genes. Correspondingly, updates to existing databases tend to be infrequent, commonly requiring years for completion and often containing inconsistences. Further, because of limitations of manual curation, most existing ARG databases contain only a small proportion of known ARGs (~5k genes). A new approach is needed to achieve a truly comprehensive ARG database, while also maintaining a high level of accuracy. Here we propose a new web-based curation system, ARG-miner, which supports annotation of ARGs at multiple levels, including: gene name, antibiotic category, resistance mechanism, and evidence for mobility and occurrence in clinically-important bacterial strains. To overcome limitations of manual curation, we employ crowdsourcing as a novel strategy for expanding curation capacity towards achieving a truly comprehensive, up-to-date database.  We develop and validate the approach by comparing performance of multiple cohorts of curators with varying levels of expertise, demonstrating that ARG-miner is more cost effective and less time-consuming relative to traditional expert curation. We further demonstrate the reliability of a trust validation filter for rejecting confounding input generated by spammers.  Crowdsourcing was found to be as accurate as expert annotation, with an accuracy u003e90% for the annotation of a diverse test set of ARGs. ARG-miner provides a public API and database available at http://bench.cs.vt.edu/argminer.",

        "abstract": "Direct selection pressures imposed by antibiotics, indirect pressures by co-selective agents, and horizontal gene transfer are fundamental drivers of the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, effective environmental monitoring tools should ideally  capture not only antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), but also mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and indicators of co-selective forces, such as metal resistance genes (MRGs). Further, a major challenge towards characterizing potential human risk is the ability to identify bacterial host organisms, especially human pathogens. Historically, short reads yielded by next-generation sequencing technology has hampered confidence in assemblies for achieving these purposes. Here we introduce NanoARG, an online computational resource that takes advantage of long reads produced by MinION nanopore sequencing. Specifically, long nanopore reads enable identification of ARGs in the context of relevant neighboring genes, providing relevant insight into mobility, co-selection, and pathogenicity. NanoARG allows users to upload sequence data online and provides various means to analyze and visualize the data, including quantitative and simultaneous profiling of ARG, MRG, MGE, and pathogens.

        "abstract": "Not only fulfilling a large portion of the worldwide meat consumption, pigs also serve as a model organism in biomedical studies due to the shared similarity with humans at both physiological and genetic levels. However, as a diploid organism, a normal pig holds two versions of genetic code simultaneously, creating an obstacle for many studies in the related field. For the first time in history, we have been able to successfully inbred pigs for more than three decades. In this paper, we sequenced and analyzed the genome of a highly inbred miniature Chinese pig strain, Banna Mini-pig Inbred Line (BMI). This specific strain of pigs has been inbred for 24 generations, the longest inbreeding history ever published. In contrast to the high level of heterozygosis in Chinese pigs, the BMI pigs show high level of homozygosis and a clear pattern on the distribution of heterozygosis along the genome. Less than 0.5% of all the short variants identified are located in coding regions, suggesting high homozygosis at the transcriptome level. We also conducted genome-wide SNP genotyping in 48 inbred pigs that are in different generations of inbreeding. Results show that overall the homozygosity of the pigs increases with the higher generation of inbreeding and comparison of the SNPs among the inbred lines shows clear trend reflecting the inbreeding history of the pigs. Thus both the whole genome sequence and SNP genotyping demonstrate that the prolonged inbreeding has led to the inbred lines to have nearly identical homologous chromosomes, and thus can provide homozygotic genes and clear genetic background. Our result could reduce the gap of linking phenotypes with genotypes, facilitate the building of pharmaceutical pig models, and shed light on the effect of extensive inbreeding.",

        "title": "Identification of Differentially Methylated Sites with Weak Methylation Effects.",
        "abstract": "Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation is an epigenetic alteration crucial for regulating stress responses. Identifying large-scale DNA methylation at single nucleotide resolution is made possible by whole genome bisulfite sequencing. An essential task following the generation of bisulfite sequencing data is to detect differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) among treatments. Most statistical methods for DMC detection do not consider the dependency of methylation patterns across the genome, thus possibly inflating type I error. Furthermore, small sample sizes and weak methylation effects among different phenotype categories make it difficult for these statistical methods to accurately detect DMCs. To address these issues, the wavelet-based functional mixed model (WFMM) was introduced to detect DMCs. To further examine the performance of WFMM in detecting weak differential methylation events, we used both simulated and empirical data and compare WFMM performance to a popular DMC detection tool methylKit. Analyses of simulated data that replicated the effects of the herbicide glyphosate on DNA methylation in  show that WFMM results in higher sensitivity and specificity in detecting DMCs compared to methylKit, especially when the methylation differences among phenotype groups are small. Moreover, the performance of WFMM is robust with respect to small sample sizes, making it particularly attractive considering the current high costs of bisulfite sequencing. Analysis of empirical  data under varying glyphosate dosages, and the analysis of monozygotic (MZ) twins who have different pain sensitivities-both datasets have weak methylation effects of <1%-show that WFMM can identify more relevant DMCs related to the phenotype of interest than methylKit. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are genomic regions with different DNA methylation status across biological samples. DMRs and DMCs are essentially the same concepts, with the only difference being how methylation information across the genome is summarized. If methylation levels are determined by grouping neighboring cytosine sites, then they are DMRs; if methylation levels are calculated based on single cytosines, they are DMCs.",

Most existing image-based crop disease recognition algorithms rely on extracting various kinds of features from leaf images of diseased plants. They have a common limitation as the features selected for discriminating leaf images are usually treated as equally important in the classification process. We propose a novel cucumber disease recognition approach which consists of three pipelined procedures: segmenting diseased leaf images by K-means clustering, extracting shape and color features from lesion information, and classifying diseased leaf images using sparse representation (SR). A major advantage of this approach is that the classification in the SR space is able to effectively reduce the computation cost and improve the recognition performance. We perform a comparison with four other feature extraction based methods using a leaf image dataset on cucumber diseases. The proposed approach is shown to be effective in recognizing seven major cucumber diseases with an overall recognition rate of 85.7%, higher than those of the other methods.",

        "abstract": "In current practice, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) applications start with mapping/aligning short reads to the reference genome, with the aim of identifying genetic mutations. While most short reads can be mapped to the reference genome accurately by existing alignment tools, a significant number remain unmapped and excluded from downstream analyses thus potentially discarding important biological information hidden in the unmapped reads. This paper describes Genesis-indel, a computational pipeline that explores the unmapped reads to identify novel indels that are initially missed in the alignment procedure. Genesis-indel is applied to the unmapped reads of 30 Breast Cancer patients from TCGA. Results show that the unmapped reads are conserved between the two subtypes of breast cancer investigated in this study and might contribute to the divergence between the subtypes. Genesis-indel is able to leverage the unmapped reads to identify 72,997 small to large novel high-quality indels previously not found in the original alignments and among them, 16,141 have not been annotated in the widely used mutation database. Statistical analysis shows that these new indels mostly altered the oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Functional annotation further reveals that these indels are strongly correlated to pathways of cancer and can have high to moderate impact on protein functions. Additionally, these indels overlap with the genes that are missed in the indels from the originally mapped reads and contribute to the tumorigenesis in multiple carcinomas.",

However, how autophagy is regulated in cancer is not well understood and genes that modulate cancer autophagy are not fully defined. To gain more insights into autophagy regulation in cancer, we performed a large-scale RNA interference screen in K562 human chronic myeloid leukemia cells using monodansylcadaverine staining, an autophagy-detecting approach equivalent to immunoblotting of the autophagy marker LC3B or fluorescence microscopy of GFP-LC3B. By coupling monodansylcadaverine staining with fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we successfully isolated autophagic K562 cells where we identified 336 short hairpin RNAs. After candidate validation using Cyto-ID fluorescence spectrophotometry, LC3B immunoblotting, and quantitative RT-PCR, 82 genes were identified as autophagy-regulating genes. 20 genes have been reported previously and the remaining 62 candidates are novel autophagy mediators. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that most candidate genes were involved in molecular pathways regulating autophagy, rather than directly participating in the autophagy process. Further autophagy flux assays revealed that 57 autophagy-regulating genes suppressed autophagy initiation, whereas 21 candidates promoted autophagy maturation. Our RNA interference screen identifies identified genes that regulate autophagy at different stages, which helps decode autophagy regulation in cancer and offers novel avenues to develop autophagy-related therapies for cancer.",

We identified seven gene families (WD repeat protein family, Ferritin Heavy Chain family, RAS-related Protein RAB-40 family, Diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolase family, Transcription Elongation Factor A family, LDOC1-related family, Zinc Finger Protein ZIC, and GLI family) that show evidence of gene conversion. Through phylogenetic analyses and synteny evidence, we show that gene conver- sion has played an important role in the evolution of these gene families and that gene conversion has occurred independently in both primates and rodents. Comparing the results with those of two gene conversion prediction programs (GENECONV and Partimatrix), we found that both GENECONV and Partimatrix have very high false negative rates (i.e. failed to predict gene conversions), which leads to many undetected gene conversions. The combi- nation of phylogenetic analyses with physical syn- teny evidence exhibits high resolution in the detection of gene conversions.",

        "title": "Effect of antibiotic use and composting on antibiotic resistance gene abundance and resistome risks of soils receiving manure-derived amendments.",
        "abstract": "Manure-derived amendments are commonly applied to soil, raising questions about whether antibiotic use in livestock could influence the soil resistome (collective antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs)) and ultimately contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance to humans during food production. Here, we examined the metagenomes of soils amended with raw or composted manure generated from dairy cows administered pirlimycin and cephapirin (antibiotic) or no antibiotics (control) relative to unamended soils. Initial amendment (Day 1) with manure or compost significantly increased the diversity (richness) of ARGs in soils (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) and resulted in distinct abundances of individual ARG types. Notably, initial amendment with antibiotic-manure significantly increased the total ARG relative abundances (per 16S rRNA gene) in the soils (2.21\u202f\u00d7\u202funamended soils, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). After incubating 120\u202fdays, to simulate a wait period before crop harvest, 282 ARGs reduced 4.33-fold (median) up to 307-fold while 210 ARGs increased 2.89-fold (median) up to 76-fold in the antibiotic-manure-amended soils, resulting in reduced total ARG relative abundances equivalent to those of the unamended soils. We further assembled the metagenomic data and calculated resistome risk scores, which was recently defined as a relative index comparing co-occurrence of sequences corresponding to ARGs, mobile genetic elements, and putative pathogens on the same scaffold. Initial amendment of manure significantly increased the soil resistome risk scores, especially when generated by cows administered antibiotics, while composting reduced the effects and resulted in soil resistomes more similar to the background. The risk scores of manure-amended soils reduced to levels comparable to the unamended soils after 120\u202fdays. Overall, this study provides an integrated, high-resolution examination of the effects of prior antibiotic use, composting, and a 120-day wait period on soil resistomes following manure-derived amendment, demonstrating that all three management practices have measurable effects and should be taken into consideration in the development of policy and practice for mitigating the spread of antibiotic resistance.",

        "title": "Parallel Evolution of Genome Streamlining and Cellular Bioenergetics across the Marine Radiation of a Bacterial Phylum.",
        "abstract": "Diverse bacterial and archaeal lineages drive biogeochemical cycles in the global ocean, but the evolutionary processes that have shaped their genomic properties and physiological capabilities remain obscure. Here we track the genome evolution of the globally abundant marine bacterial phylum  across its diversification into modern marine environments and demonstrate that extant lineages are partitioned between epipelagic and mesopelagic habitats. Moreover, we show that these habitat preferences are associated with fundamental differences in genomic organization, cellular bioenergetics, and metabolic modalities. Multiple lineages present in epipelagic niches independently acquired genes necessary for phototrophy and environmental stress mitigation, and their genomes convergently evolved key features associated with genome streamlining. In contrast, lineages residing in mesopelagic waters independently acquired nitrate respiratory machinery and a variety of cytochromes, consistent with the use of alternative terminal electron acceptors in oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). Further, while epipelagic clades have retained an ancestral Na-pumping respiratory complex, mesopelagic lineages have largely replaced this complex with canonical H-pumping respiratory complex I, potentially due to the increased efficiency of the latter together with the presence of the more energy-limiting environments deep in the ocean's interior. These parallel evolutionary trends indicate that key features of genomic streamlining and cellular bioenergetics have occurred repeatedly and congruently in disparate clades and underscore the importance of environmental conditions and nutrient dynamics in driving the evolution of diverse bacterioplankton lineages in similar ways throughout the global ocean. Understanding long-term patterns of microbial evolution is critical to advancing our knowledge of past and present role microbial life in driving global biogeochemical cycles. Historically, it has been challenging to study the evolution of environmental microbes due to difficulties in obtaining genome sequences from lineages that could not be cultivated, but recent advances in metagenomics and single-cell genomics have begun to obviate many of these hurdles. Here we present an evolutionary genomic analysis of the , a diverse bacterial group that is abundant in the global ocean. We demonstrate that distantly related  species that reside in similar habitats have converged to assume similar genome architectures and cellular bioenergetics, suggesting that common factors shape the evolution of a broad array of marine lineages. These findings broaden our understanding of the evolutionary forces that have given rise to microbial life in the contemporary ocean.",

        "abstract": "This work examines the molecular evolution of a brain-expressed X-linked gene family in the mammalian genomes of human, chimp, macaque, mouse, rat, dog, and cow. The gene structures are well conserved across family members and among the mammals in that all five members have three exons with the first two exons untranslated. Furthermore, the five members are arranged tandemly on chromosome X with Bex5, Bex1, Bex2 on the negative strand and Bex4, Bex3 on the positive strand, and this physical arrangement remains conserved among species. Sequence analyses indicate that gene conversion has been frequent and ongoing among Bex1-4, occurring in multiple species independently. All gene conversions in different species between Bex1 and Bex4, and between Bex2 and Bex3, appear to be limited to the upstream regions of the third exon, whereas the gene conversions occurred independently in different species between Bex1 and Bex2 and cover only the third exon. Bex5 appears to have little exchange of genetic information with other members, possibly due to its distance from other members. The GC content decreases from 5'-UTR, intron 1, intron 2, coding region, to 3'-UTR, reflecting faithfully the frequency of gene conversion in different regions of the Bex genes. Sequence analyses also suggest that both relaxed selective constraint and positive selection have acted on the Bex members after duplication. In particular, Bex3 shows strong evidence of positive selection and seems to have evolved a new gene function after gene duplication.",

        "abstract": "Dairy cattle are routinely treated with antibiotics, and the resulting manure or composted manure is commonly used as a soil amendment for crop production, raising questions regarding the potential for antibiotic resistance to propagate from \"farm to fork.\" The objective of this study was to compare the microbiota and \"resistomes\" (i.e., carriage of antibiotic resistance genes [ARGs]) associated with lettuce leaf and radish taproot surfaces grown in different soils amended with dairy manure, compost, or chemical fertilizer only (control). Manure was collected from antibiotic-free dairy cattle (DC) or antibiotic-treated dairy cattle (DA), with a portion composted for parallel comparison. Amendments were applied to loamy sand or silty clay loam, and lettuce and radishes were cultivated to maturity in a greenhouse. Metagenomes were profiled via shotgun Illumina sequencing. Radishes carried a distinct ARG composition compared to that of lettuce, with greater relative abundance of total ARGs. Taxonomic species richness was also greater for radishes by 1.5-fold. The resistomes of lettuce grown with DC compost were distinct from those grown with DA compost, DC manure, or fertilizer only. Further, compost applied to loamy sand resulted in twofold-greater relative abundance of total ARGs on lettuce than when applied to silty clay loam. The resistomes of radishes grown with biological amendments were distinct from the corresponding fertilizer controls, but effects of composting or antibiotic use were not measureable. Cultivation in loamy sand resulted in higher species richness for both lettuce and radishes than when grown in silty clay loam by 2.2-fold and 1.2-fold, respectively, when amended with compost. A controlled, integrated, and replicated greenhouse study, along with comprehensive metagenomic analysis, revealed that multiple preharvest factors, including antibiotic use during manure collection, composting, biological soil amendment, and soil type, influence vegetable-borne resistomes. Here, radishes, a root vegetable, carried a greater load of ARGs and species richness than lettuce, a leafy vegetable. However, the lettuce resistome was more noticeably influenced by upstream antibiotic use and composting. Network analysis indicated that cooccurring ARGs and mobile genetic elements were almost exclusively associated with conditions receiving raw manure amendments, suggesting that composting could alleviate the mobility of manure-derived resistance traits. Effects of preharvest factors on associated microbiota and resistomes of vegetables eaten raw are worthy of further examination in terms of potential influence on human microbiomes and spread of antibiotic resistance. This research takes a step toward identifying on-farm management practices that can help mitigate the spread of agricultural sources of antibiotic resistance.",

The gait sequence is easier to be affected by factors than other biometric feathers. In order to achieve better performance of the gait based identification system, in the paper, a local discriminant gait recognition method is proposed by integrating weighted adaptive center symmetric local binary pattern (WACS-LBP) with local linear discriminate projection (LLDP). The proposed method consists of two stages. In the first stage, the robust local weighted histogram feature vector is extracted from each gait image by WACS-LBP. In the second stage, the dimensionality of the extracted feature vector is reduced by LLDP. The highlights of the proposed method are (1) the extracted feature is robust to rotation invariant, and is also tolerant to illumination and pose changes; (2) the low dimensional feature vector reduced by LLDP can preserve the discriminating ability; and (3) the small-sample-size (SSS) problem is avoided naturally. The proposed method is validated and compared with the existing algorithms on a public gait database. The experimental results show that the proposed method is not only effective, but also can be clearly interpreted.",

        "abstract": "The functional profile of metagenomic samples allows the understanding of the role of the microbes in their environment. Such analysis consists of assigning short sequencing reads to a particular functional category. Normally, manually curated databases are used for functional assignment where genes are arranged into different classes. Sequence alignment has been widely used to profile metagenomic samples against curated databases. However, this method is time consuming and requires high computing resources. Although several alignment free methods based on k-mer composition have been developed in the recent years, they still require a large amount of memory. In this paper, MetaMLP (Metagenomics Machine Learning Profiler) a machine learning method that represents sequences into numerical vectors (embeddings) and uses a simple one hidden layer neural network to profile functional categories is proposed. Unlike other methods, MetaMLP enables partial matching by using a reduced alphabet to build sequence embeddings from full and partial kmers. MetaMLP is able to identify a slightly larger number of reads compared to Diamond (one of the fastest sequence alignment method) as well as to perform accurate predictions with 0.99 precision and 0.99 recall. MetaMLP can process 100M reads in around 10 minutes in a laptop computer which is 50x faster than Diamond. MetaMLP is free for use, available at https://bitbucket.org/gaarangoa/metamlp/src/master/.",

        "abstract": "As computing is an enabling tool of bioinformatics, software quality can influence not only the efficiency of the research process, but also the degree of confidence in scientific findings. As we discovered, popular bioinformatics C++ libraries suffer from problems that make their code hard to maintain, finetune, and extend. In particular, code duplication caused by the ubiquitous copy-and-paste development practice, substantially complicates software maintenance and evolution. The presence of multiple clones of the same code snippet multiples the amount of effort required to modify or extend it. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic study we have conducted to understand the code quality of popular bioinformatics libraries. Based on the results of our study, we developed an automated tool that systematically identifies and consolidates duplicated code blocks. Here we describe our tool\u2014ReBio 1 \u2014and the results of applying it to improve the quality of several commonly used C++ libraries, including SeqAn, BEDtools, and NCBI C++ Toolkit. Our results reveal that these libraries indeed suffer from poor maintainability, and that our automated tool can effectively improve their quality.",

        "abstract": "Phylogenetic tree reconstruction requires construction of a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) from sequences. Computationally, it is difficult to achieve an optimal MSA for many sequences. Moreover, even if an optimal MSA is obtained, it may not be the true MSA that reflects the evolutionary history of the underlying sequences. Therefore, errors can be introduced during MSA construction which in turn affects the subsequent phylogenetic tree construction. In order to circumvent this issue, we extend the application of the k-tuple distance to phylogenetic tree reconstruction. The k-tuple distance between two sequences is the sum of the differences in frequency, over all possible tuples of length k, between the sequences and can be estimated without MSAs. It has been traditionally used to build a fast 'guide tree' to assist the construction of MSAs. Using the 1470 simulated sets of sequences generated under different evolutionary scenarios, the neighbor-joining trees and BioNJ trees, we compared the performance of the k-tuple distance with four commonly used distance estimators including Jukes-Cantor, Kimura, F84 and Tamura-Nei. These four distance estimators fall into the category of model-based distance estimators, as each of them takes account of a specific substitution model in order to compute the distance between a pair of already aligned sequences. Results show that trees constructed from the k-tuple distance are more accurate than those from other distances most time; when the divergence between underlying sequences is high, the tree accuracy could be twice or higher using the k-tuple distance than other estimators. Furthermore, as the k-tuple distance voids the need for constructing an MSA, it can save tremendous amount of time for phylogenetic tree reconstructions when the data include a large number of sequences.",

The TribeMCL with the E-value matrix performed best, with the Inflation parameter (=1.15) tuned considerably lower than what has been suggested previously\n (=2). The single-linkage clustering method with the E-value matrix was second best.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests that overlapping genes are much more common in eukaryotic genomes than previously thought. In this study we identified and characterized the overlapping genes in a set of 13,484 pairs of human-mouse orthologous genes. RESULTS: About 10% of the genes under study are overlapping genes, the majority of which are different-strand overlaps. The majority of the same-strand overlaps are embedded forms, whereas most different-strand overlaps are not embedded and in the convergent transcription orientation. Most of the same-strand overlapping gene pairs show at least a tenfold difference in length, much larger than the length difference between non-overlapping neighboring gene pairs. The length difference between the two different-strand overlapping genes is less dramatic. Over 27% of the different-strand-overlap relationships are shared between human and mouse, compared to only ~8% conservation for same-strand-overlap relationships. More than 96% of the same-strand and different-strand overlaps that are not shared between human and mouse have both genes located on the same chromosomes in the species that does not show the overlap. We examined the causes of transition between the overlapping and non-overlapping states in the two species and found that 3' UTR change plays an important role in the transition. CONCLUSION: Our study contributes to the understanding of the evolutionary transition between overlapping genes and non-overlapping genes and demonstrates the high rates of evolutionary changes in the un-translated regions.",

        "abstract": "The spread of antibiotic resistance is a growing public health concern. While numerous studies have highlighted the importance of environmental sources and pathways of the spread of antibiotic resistance, a systematic means of comparing and prioritizing risks represented by various environmental compartments is lacking. Here we introduce MetaCompare, a publicly-available tool for ranking 'resistome risk,' which we define as the potential for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) to be associated with mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and mobilize to pathogens based on metagenomic data. A computational pipeline was developed in which each ARG is evaluated based on relative abundance, mobility, and presence within a pathogen. This is determined through assembly of shotgun sequencing data and analysis of contigs containing ARGs to determine if they contain sequence similarity to MGEs or human pathogens. Based on the assembled metagenomes, samples are projected into a 3-D hazard space and assigned resistome risk scores. To validate, we tested previously published metagenomic data derived from distinct aquatic environments. Based on unsupervised machine learning, the test samples clustered in the hazard space in a manner consistent with their origin. The derived scores produced a well-resolved ascending resistome risk ranking of: wastewater treatment plant effluent, dairy lagoon, hospital sewage.",

        "abstract": "Indel which represents the insertion and deletion of base pairs in the sequence of an organism is a very common form of genetic variation that takes place in the human genome. Being responsible for genetic diversity and human disease, indels have been considered as an important area in the genome research community. With progress in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), a good number of indel calling tools have been developed and different databases store the results of different indel calling tools for future research. Different indels, though differing in allele sequence and position, can be biologically equivalent when they lead to the same altered sequences. Storing these biologically equivalent indels as distinct entries in databases causes data redundancy. Previous research showed that about 10% human indels stored in dbSNP are redundant due to lack of a unified system for identifying and representing equivalent indels. In this paper we describe UPS-indel, a utility tool that creates a universal positioning system for indels so that equivalent indels can be identified easily by a simple comparison of their coordinates generated by the proposed positioning system. Applying UPS-indel, we identify nearly 15% redundant indels in dbSNP (version 142) across all human chromosomes, higher than the previous report. UPS-indel is written in C++ and is freely available at http://bench.cs.vt.edu/ups-indel.",

        "abstract": "Plant defense genes are subject to nonneutral evolutionary dynamics. Here we investigate the evolutionary dynamics of the duplicated defense genes hm1 and hm2 in maize and its wild ancestor Zea mays ssp. parviglumis. Both genes have been shown to confer resistance to the fungal pathogen Cochliobolus carbonum race 1, but the effectiveness of resistance differs between loci. The genes also display different population histories. The hm1 locus has the highest nucleotide diversity of any gene yet sampled in the wild ancestor of maize, and it contains a large number of indel polymorphisms. There is no evidence, however, that high diversity in hm1 is a product of nonneutral evolution. In contrast, hm2 has very low nucleotide diversi- ty in the wild ancestor of maize. The distribution of hm2 polymorphic sites is consistent with nonneutral evolution, as indicated by Tajima's D and other neutrality tests. In addition, one hm2 haplotype is more frequent than expected under the equilibrium neutral model, suggesting hitchhiking selection. Both defense genes retain 80% of the level of genetic variation in maize relative to the wild ancestor, and this level is similar to other maize genes that were not subject to artificial selection during domestication.",

        "abstract": "We characterized rates and patterns of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution in 242 duplicated gene pairs on chromosomes 2 and 4 of Arabidopsis thaliana. Based on their collinear order along the two chromosomes, the gene pairs were likely duplicated contemporaneously, and therefore comparison of genetic distances among gene pairs provides insights into the distribution of nucleotide substitution rates among plant nuclear genes. Rates of synonymous substitution varied 13.8-fold among the duplicated gene pairs, but 90% of gene pairs differed by less than 2.6-fold. Average nonsynonymous rates were approximately fivefold lower than average synonymous rates; this rate difference is lower than that of previously studied nonplant lineages. The coefficient of variation of rates among genes was 0.65 for nonsynonymous rates and 0.44 for synonymous rates, indicating that synonymous and nonsynonymous rates vary among genes to roughly the same extent. The causes underlying rate variation were explored. Our analyses tentatively suggest an effect of physical location on synonymous substitution rates but no similar effect on nonsynonymous rates. Nonsynonymous substitution rates were negatively correlated with GC content at synonymous third codon positions, and synonymous substitution rates were negatively correlated with codon bias, as observed in other systems. Finally, the 242 gene pairs permitted investigation of the processes underlying divergence between paralogs. We found no evidence of positive selection, little evidence that paralogs evolve at different rates, and no evidence of differential codon usage or third position GC content.",

We found that approximately 4% of the genome is covered by duplications and that the extent of segmental duplication varies from 1% to 14% among the 24 chromosomes. Intrachromosomal duplication is more frequent than interchromosomal duplication in 15 chromosomes. The duplication frequencies in pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions are greater than the genome average by approximately threefold and fourfold. We examined factors that may affect the frequency of duplication in a region. Within individual chromosomes, the duplication frequency shows little correlation with local gene density, repeat density, recombination rate, and GC content, except chromosomes 7 and Y. For the entire genome, the duplication frequency is correlated with each of the above factors. Based on known genes and Ensembl genes, the proportion of duplications containing complete genes is 3.4% and 10.7%, respectively. The proportion of duplications containing genes is higher in intrachromosomal than in interchromosomal duplications, and duplications containing genes have a higher sequence similarity and tend to be longer than duplications containing no genes. Our simulation suggests that many duplications containing genes have been selectively maintained in the genome.",

Using mouse as a second species for computing sequence divergences, we found no evidence of positive selection: for both housekeeping and tissue-specific genes, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous common SNPs per site showed no significant difference from that of divergence. Similarly, we observed no evidence of positive selection for the 289 and 149 genes that have orthologs available for divergence calculation between humans and chimpanzees and between humans and Old World monkeys, respectively.

        "abstract": "Plant polyphenols quercetin and naringenin are considered healthy dietary compounds; however, little is known of their effect on the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG). In this study it was discovered that both quercetin and naringenin produced temporary inhibition of LGG growth, particularly at 8 hours post inoculation, with LGG eventually recovering from this suppression. The observed growth inhibition was regarded as a phenotypic response of LGG to the polyphenols; we hypothesized that the subsequent recovery was due to unknown, underlying genetic factors. The molecular response of LGG to quercetin and naringenin was determined through RNA analysis using the Helicos single molecule sequencing platform. The expression profiles of LGG grown in the presence of either quercetin or naringenin were divergent from each other, with only a few similarities, indicating that these polyphenols inhibit growth through separate mechanisms. LGG treated with quercetin demonstrated upregulation of genes associated with DNA repair and transcriptional regulation, and a decrease in expression of genes involved in metabolism and protein movement through the cell wall. LGG treated with naringenin resulted in an increase of genes associated with metabolism, and a decrease in genes involved in stress response. Results from this study demonstrate that there is a clear interaction between the polyphenols quercetin and naringenin and the probiotic LGG. The RNA expression analysis provides unique insight into the molecular response of LGG to quercetin and naringenin, revealing an identifiable pattern of gene expression.",

        "abstract": "Diverse bacterial and archaeal lineages drive biogeochemical cycles in the global ocean, but the evolutionary processes that have shaped their genomic properties and physiological capabilities remain obscure. Here we track the genome evolution of the globally-abundant marine bacterial phylum Marinimicrobia across its diversification into modern marine environments and demonstrate that extant lineages have repeatedly switched between epipelagic and mesopelagic habitats. Moreover, we show that these habitat transitions have been accompanied by repeated and fundamental shifts in genomic organization, cellular bioenergetics, and metabolic modalities. Lineages present in epipelagic niches independently acquired genes necessary for phototrophy and environmental stress mitigation, and their genomes convergently evolved key features associated with genome streamlining. Conversely, lineages residing in mesopelagic waters independently acquired nitrate respiratory machinery and a variety of cytochromes, consistent with the use of alternative terminal electron acceptors in oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). Further, while surface water clades have retained an ancestral Na + -pumping respiratory complex, deep water lineages have replaced this complex with a canonical H + -pumping respiratory complex I, potentially due to the increased efficiency of the latter together with more energy-limiting environments deep in the ocean9s interior. These parallel evolutionary trends across disparate clades suggest that the evolution of key features of genomic organization and cellular bioenergetics in abundant marine lineages may in some ways be predictable and driven largely by environmental conditions and nutrient dynamics.",

Such tool installation and workflow execution process is tedious and error-prone, and becomes very challenging when researchers need to compare multiple alternative tool chains. To mitigate this problem, we developed a new lightweight and portable system, Biopipe, to simplify the creation and execution of bioinformatics tools and workflows, and to further enable the comparison between alternative tools or workflows. Biopipe allows users to create and edit workflows with user-friendly web interfaces, and automates tool installation as well as workflow synthesis by downloading and executing predefined Docker images. With Biopipe, biologists can easily experiment with and compare different bioinformatics tools and workflows without much computer science knowledge. There are mainly two parts in Biopipe: a web application and a standalone Java application.

However, a general phenomenon is significant comovement among many financial signals, such as stocks and futures. One investment strategy is to choose less correlated assets. Classic approaches quantifying such relationships in real financial markets make it difficult to exclude factors such as market trends and autocorrelation. In this paper, we propose a signal process perspective for quantitative measurement. A machine learning based algorithm is designed to model returns, taking account of market sensitivity, autocorrelation, and relationships with other stocks. We then extend the model training algorithm using regularized least square and gradient descent to estimate parameters. A penalty factor is designed in the optimization function to address extreme large negative returns. After denoising common factors, the learned pure relationship parameters are applied to construct a relationship matrix. Finally, we use this matrix to build portfolios by constrained optimization. Empirical experiments on two stock datasets show that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean average precision and cumulative returns.",

The prediction of default of enterprise loans is a typical extremely imbalanced prediction problem, and the networked-guarantee make this problem more difficult to solve. Since the guaranteed loan is a debt obligation promise, if one enterprise in the guarantee network falls into a financial crisis, the debt risk may spread like a virus across the guarantee network, even lead to a systemic financial crisis. In this paper, we propose an imbalanced network risk diffusion model to forecast the enterprise default risk in a short future. Positive weighted k-nearest neighbors (p-wkNN) algorithm is developed for the stand-alone case - when there is no default contagious; then a data-driven default diffusion model is integrated to further improve the prediction accuracy. We perform the empirical study on a real-world three-years loan record from a major commercial bank. The results show that our proposed method outperforms conventional credit risk methods in terms of AUC. In summary, our quantitative risk evaluation model shows promising prediction performance on real-world data, which could be useful to both regulators and stakeholders.",

        "abstract": ", which is part of the  species complex, can cause anthracnose diseases in strawberries worldwide. However, the molecular interactions between  and strawberry are largely unknown. A deep RNA-sequencing approach was applied to gain insights into the pathogenicity mechanisms of  and the defense response of strawberry plants at different stages of infection. The transcriptome data showed stage-specific transcription accompanied by a step-by-step strawberry defense response and the evasion of this defense system by fungus. Fungal genes involved in plant cell wall degradation, secondary metabolism, and detoxification were up-regulated at different stage of infection. Most importantly,  infection was accompanied by a large number of highly expressed effectors. Four new identified effectors function in the suppression of Bax-mediated programmed cell death. Strawberry utilizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP)-triggered immunity and effector-triggered immunity to prevent  invasion, followed by the initiation of downstream innate immunity. The up-regulation of genes related to salicylic acid provided evidence that salicylic acid signaling may serve as the core defense signaling mechanism, while jasmonic acid and ethylene pathways were largely inhibited by . The necrotrophic stage displayed a significant up-regulation of genes involved in reactive oxygen species activation. Collectively, the transcriptomic data of both  and strawberry shows that even though plants build a multilayered defense against infection,  employs a series of escape or antagonizing mechanisms to successfully infect host cells.",

        "title": "Fast quenching the burst of host salicylic acid is common in early strawberry/Colletotrichum fructicola interaction.",
        "abstract": "The fungus Colletotrichum fructicola (a species of C. gloeosporioides complex) causes devastating anthracnose in strawberry. Like other species of the genus Colletotrichum, it employs a composite strategy including both the biotrophic and necrotrophic processes for pathogenesis. Host-derived hormones are central regulators of immunity, among which salicylic acid (SA) is the core defense one against biotrophic and hemibiotrophic pathogens. However, the manner and timing of pathogen manipulation of SA are largely elusive in strawberry. To achieve better understanding of the early challenges SA-mediated defense experiences during strawberry/C. fructicola interaction, dynamic changes of SA levels were followed through high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. A very early burst of free SA at 1 hpi followed by a fast quenching during the following 12 hrs was noticed, although rhythm variations were present in two hosts. Transcriptional characterization of genes related to SA pathway in two varieties upon C. fructicola inoculation revealed that these genes were differentially expressed, although they were all induced at different time points. At the same time, three types of genes encoding homologous effectors interfering with SA accumulation, were found to be first inhibited but sequentially activated during the early 24 hpi. Furthermore, subcellular localization analysis suggests that CfShy1 is a weapon of C. frcticola for strawberry invasion. Based on these results, we propose that the infection strategy C. fructicola utilizes to strawberry is specialized, which is implemented through the optimized expression of a specific set of effector genes. Transcriptional characterization of host genes supports that de novo SA biosynthesis and the free SA release from MeSA might contribute equally to the intricate control of SA homeostasis in strawberry. C. fructicola manipulation of SA-dependent resistance in strawberry might be closely related with multi-hormonal interplay among SA, JA, ABA, and CK.",

        "abstract": "The various post-translational modifications of plant proteins have important regulatory roles in development. We therefore examined various modified proteins from strawberry stigmata and found that succinylation of lysine residues was the most abundant type of modification. We then subjected proteins from strawberry stigmata to an efficient enrichment method for succinylated peptides and identified 200 uniquely succinylated lysines in 116 proteins. A bioinformatics analysis revealed that these proteins are involved in important biological processes, including stress responses, vesicular transport, and energy metabolism. Proteomics, combined with immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, revealed an obvious increase in succinylation of the assembly polypeptide 2 (AP2) and clathrin from 0.5 to 2 h after pollination, suggesting that succinylation is involved in the recognition of pollen-stigma signaling substances and vesicular transport. These results suggest that AP2/clathrin-mediated vesicular transport processes are regulated by lysine succinylation during pollen recognition.",

        "abstract": "Anthracnose caused by C. fructicola is a serious fungal disease in strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7ananassa), but the molecular mechanism is still unclear. Here, approximately 232 FaNBS-encoding genes were identified by RNA-seq, of which 53 were specifically annotated in the Fragaria \u00d7ananassa genome. After C. fructicola inoculation, a total of 12, 9 and 24 differentially expressed FaNBS-encoding genes were observed at 24, 72, and 96 Hpi in the Fragaria \u00d7ananassa (cv. Jiuxiang). Furthermore, we manually annotated 40 FaNBS-encoding genes fused with other integrated domains, 27 of which are FaNBS-RPW8 fusions. Most of the RPW8 domains from the FaNBS-RPW8 fusions were conserved in the tyrosine (Y) and glycine (G) residues. Interestingly, the heatmap, Venn diagram and qRT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of an FaNBS-RPW8 fusion (mrna24117.1-v1.0-hybrid) was markedly induced at different stages after C. fructicola inoculation in the susceptible cultivar of Jiuxiang. Altogether, the results of the present study provide information from comprehensive structure and expression analyses of FaNBS-encoding genes and add insight into the molecular mechanism underlying FaNBS-RPW8-mediated resistance to C. fructicola in strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7ananassa).",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A carbon nanotube (CNT)/nanocarbon black (NCB) composite filler was incorporated into cement matrix to develop smart cement-based materials with piezoresistive property. However, the effect of water on the cement-based materials with CNT/NCB composite filler is not easy to avoid in practical engineering. Therefore, in this paper, the effect and mechanisms of water content on the piezoresistive property of cement-based materials with CNT/NCB composite filler are investigated. Cement-based materials with fillers feature the piezoresistive property under different water contents. However, the maximum fractional changes in electrical resistivity, stress sensitivity and strain sensitivity all decrease with the reduction in water content. The maximum values of fractional change in electrical resistivity, stress sensitivity and strain sensitivity of the cement-based material with 2.14\u202fvol% of filler change nonlinearly from \u221212.94% to \u22126.80%, 3.15%/MPa to 1.70%/MPa, and 389 to 202, respectively, with decreasing water content. With the reduction in water content, the decrease in contact resistance between fillers and the increase in the composite shrinkage result in a decrease in the sensitivity of the piezoresistive property.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Nano SiO 2 -coated TiO 2  (NSCT) is used to reinforce reactive powder concrete (RPC). The reinforcing mechanisms of NSCT are investigated through thermogravimetry (TG) analysis, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis, elemental analysis and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation. The mechanical strengths of the NSCT reinforced RPC (NSCTRRPC) at different curing ages manifest significant increases, especially flexural behaviors. The flexural and compressive strengths of NSCTRRPC at age of 28\u00a0d achieve increases of 87%/6.69\u00a0MPa and 12.26%/12.2\u00a0MPa with respect to RPC without NSCT, respectively. TG analyses suggest that acceleration of cement hydration caused by nucleus effect plays a dominant role in the early days. XRD analyses manifests the NSCT decreases the amount of CH crystals in matrix. This suggests that the NSCT has the pozzolanic effect. In addition, element analysis is indicative that NSCT is uniformly distributed inside the matrix to make the cement matrix more compact, which is in consistent with SEM observations. It is therefore concluded that coating of nano SiO 2  at the surface of TiO 2  is beneficial for the dispersion of nano fillers in matrix and the pozzolanic effect, thus modifying the microstructures and the mechanical property of RPC.",

Research results indicate that the addition of MLGs can achieve an enhancement of 54% in compressive strength and a reinforcement of 21% in flexural strength to cementitious composites, respectively. The strengthening effects can be attributed to extensive distribution network of MLGs inside matrix, decreasing ratio of water to cement and self-curing caused by water adsorption and release of MLGs, reducing primary cracks due to MLGs presence, strong bonding between MLGs and matrix, and lowering orientation index of calcium hydroxide crystal in hydration products of cementitious composites. It is therefore concluded that MLGs are effective nanoscale fillers for reinforcing cementitious composites.",

The enhancing effects of different fillers on the compressive strength and electrical resistivity of composites are compared, and the underlying modification mechanisms of fillers to composites are investigated by analyzing the difference in the morphology of fillers and rheology of composites. The compressive strength of composites containing 0.1% NS, 0.5% NT, 0.1% CNTs and 0.5% CFs by weight of cement presents approximately 12.5%, 20.8%, 16.8% and 21.4% higher than that of control sample, respectively. It is revealed that CFs also have improving effect on the compressive strength of composites besides flexural strength. When the composites with nano-fillers cannot be processed to ideal state, the reinforcing effect of nano-fillers is no better but even worse than that of micro-fillers. Composites with CNTs, CNFs and CFs possess good electrical conductivity. Composites with CNFs and CFs have a percolation threshold of electrical resistivity below 0.5%, while the percolation threshold of electrical resistivity of composites with CNTs is about 1%. Although CNFs do not have significant effect on compressive strength of composites, they have the best improvement to electrical resistivity.",

Moreover, hydroxyl-functionalized MWCNTs feature a better reinforcement effect compared to carboxyl-functionalized MWCNTs. The best relative/absolute enhancements of 79%/74\u202fMPa and 64.4%/5.6\u202fMPa in compressive and flexural strength of composites are achieved by incorporating 0.5% of nickel-coated MWCNTs. XRD analyses revealed that the incorporation of MWCNTs decreases the orientation of CH in matrix, which is consistent with SEM observations. TG analyses showed that MWCNTs inhibit hydration of composites due to their absorption effect. However, extensive MWCNT networks improve microstructure of matrix and hinder the crack development under loading through fiber bridging and pull-out.",

The mechanical, electrical and piezoresistive properties of the cement-based materials with CNT/NCB composite fillers are investigated. Percolation equation is used to describe electrically conductive property. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and equivalent circuits are used to explore the conductive and mechanical mechanism. The research results show that cement-based materials with CNT/NCB composite fillers at low content present acceptable mechanical property, high conductive property and stable and sensitive piezoresistive property. The fractional change of electrical resistivity, stress and strain sensitivity of cement-based materials with 1.41\u202fvol.% CNT/NCB composite fillers can reach 13.4%, 3.12%/MPa and 521, respectively. It is concluded that high CNT aspect ratio and large NCB size in CNT/NCB composite fillers are beneficial for improving the properties of smart cement-based composites.",

Theoretical calculation and thermogravimetry (TG) analysis, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-Ray powder diffraction (XRD), and electrical resistivity test were used to analyze the reinforcing mechanisms of NS. Theoretically, consumed calcium hydroxide (CH) increases with NS content, which indicates that NS has huge potential to react with CH. According to the results of TG, the amount of consumed CH increases and agrees with theoretical calculation when the content of NS is less than 1.5%. However, a plateau is achieved for the mass of consumed CH in results of TG when the content of NS exceeds 1.5%. SEM shows that NS can make matrix dense and also reduce the size of CH in matrix beside interfacial transition zone (ITZ).

The mechanical and electrical properties of carbon fiber filled cement mortar were tested to examine the reinforcing effect of carbon fiber. In order to understand the underlying modification mechanisms of carbon fibers to cement mortar at micro scale and in theory, scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation and theoretical calculations were carried out. Test results indicate that the adding of carbon fibers into cement mortar enhances the mechanical strength (especially compressive strength), and decreases the electrical resistivity of carbon fiber filled cement mortar. SEM results show that the enhancement of the properties of carbon fiber filled cement mortar owes to fiber ability of restraining the growth of microcracks and absorbing energy by overcoming its pulling out. The enhancing mechanism of carbon fibers on the properties of cement mortar analyzed by the calculated fiber numbers per unit volume, average center distance between two carbon fibers and the critical pull-out length well matches the experimental results.",

The addition of nano fillers makes cementitious materials stronger, more durable and multifunctional/smart. This paper aims at investigating the underlying mechanism for understanding and controlling the nano-engineered cementitious composites. The nano-core effect is proposed through integrating core-effect with nano effect, and is proved by experimental evidences for the cementitious composites with different nano fillers. The nano-core effect is closely relative to the intrinsic properties of nano fillers, composition and processing of the cementitious composites. The behaviors of the nano-engineered cementitious composites are governed by nano-core effect zone, i.e. nano-core-shell element. It is therefore concluded that the nano-core effect is fundamental for design, fabrication and application of the nano-engineered cementitious composites.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate maximum likelihood (ML) time delay (TD) and carrier frequency offset (CFO) synchronization in multi-node decode-and-forward cooperative relaying systems operating over time-varying channels. This new synchronization scheme is embedded into a distributed multiple input multiple output (MIMO)-relay beamforming transceiver structure to avoid the drawbacks of multidimensional ML estimation at the destination and to minimize the overhead cost. By accounting for a perfect Doppler spread value, the new synchronization solution delivers accurate TD and CFO estimates. For real-world operation, however, this new technique can be jointly implemented with any Doppler spread estimator in a new iterative scheme using a time-constant channel (TCC)-based synchronization method at the initialization step. The resulting TD and CFO estimates along with the channel estimates are then fed into a distributed MIMO-relay beamforming transceiver of \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$K$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n single-antenna nodes, for pre-compensation at each node of the transmitted signals, to ensure constructive maximum ratio combining (MRC) at the destination. Simulation results show significant synchronization accuracy improvement over previous distributed multi-node synchronization techniques assuming TCCs. The latter translates into noticeable gains in terms of useful link-level throughput, more so at higher Doppler or with more relaying nodes.",

The simulations show that they may achieve until 154% and 282% of throughput and coverage gains, respectively.

We devise a new maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm for the joint estimation of these synchronization parameters based on the importance sampling (IS) technique. Unlike the traditional iterative estimation techniques, the proposed IS-based ML approach enjoys guaranteed global optimality. Moreover, it transforms the original multi-dimensional optimization problem into multiple two-dimensional ones, thereby entailing low computational burden.

The new UEV scheme is able to adapt to each target UE (TUE) environment, meet its demands, and scale with its needs, offers a reliable and efficient yet low-cost inter-UE cooperation, reduces the overhead and power consumption with respect to conventional approaches, and substantially reduces the number of communication links and, hence, incurs much less interference. System-level simulation results show that the proposed QoS-based UEV scheme largely outperforms the \u201cdummy UEs\u201d approach.",

The new technique is embedded at each relay node in order to avoid the drawbacks of multidimensional ML estimation at the destination and to minimize the overhead cost. By accounting for a perfect Doppler spread value, the new synchronization solution delivers accurate TD and CFO estimates at each relay. The resulting TD and CFO estimates along with the channel estimates are then exploited by the MIMO relay for precompensation at each node of the distributed transmit beamforming signals to ensure constructive maximum ratio combining (MRC) at the destination. Simulation results show significant synchronization accuracy improvement over previous distributed multi-node synchronization techniques assuming time-constant channels (TCCs). The latter translates into noticeable gains in terms of useful (i.e., after accounting for incurred overhead) link-level throughput, more so at higher Doppler.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that miR-202 is associated with several types of cancer; however, the expression and function of miR-202 have not been investigated in bladder cancer. Here, we analyzed the expression of miR-202 in bladder cancer tissue and adjacent non-cancerous tissues. The effect of miR-202 on proliferation, migration and invasion was evaluated by in-vitro assays. The target gene of miR-202 was assessed by luciferase reporter assay. In this study, miR-202 was found to be significantly downregulated in bladder cancer cell lines and tissues, and was highly correlated with the T classification, N classification, grade, and recurrence. Ectopic expression of miR-202 suppressed cell viability, colony formation, cell migration and invasion in vitro, and inhibited xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Inversely, down-regulation of miR-202 had the contrary effects. The 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was identified as a direct target of miR-202 using luciferase reporter assays, and knockdown of EGFR enhanced miR-202-inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In conclusion, miR-202 suppresses bladder cancer carcinogenesis and progression by targeting EGFR, thereby representing a potential target for miRNA-based therapy for bladder cancer in the future.",

        "abstract": "5G wireless networks are expected to support new applications demanding ultra high reliability and ultra low latency, such as self-driving cars, industrial control, and real-time gaming. Such services are known as ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) targeting at 99.999% transmission correctness within 1 ms delay bound. Current Long Term Evolution (LTE) system is far from supporting such services, especially for uplink. Even with around 10 times shortened transmission interval, due to the waste of time in requesting and receiving the scheduling grant, only one shot uplink transmission can be supported within 1 ms, which is very hard to meet the reliability requirement. Grant-Free transmission is thus proposed to effectively save the time of requesting/waiting for grant and thus relax the transmission interval design in frame structure. This paper presents the design of grant-free transmission for URLLC services and also the evaluation results. We shall show that the saved time can be used for more Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) retransmissions and thus further enhance the reliability. Moreover, contention based grant-free transmission with proper HARQ design can well meet the reliability requirement. Finally, the performance can be further enhanced with non-orthogonal multiple access schemes such as Sparse Code Multiple Access (SCMA) and advanced receivers such as Message Passing Algorithm (MPA) or Expectation Propagation Algorithm (EPA) receiver.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims to evaluate the system level performance of the newly proposed non-orthogonal multiple access scheme sparse code multiple access (SCMA) with uplink grant-free transmissions for 5G massive machine-type communication (mMTC) scenario. The challenge lies in the modeling and abstraction of physical layer actions as the link-to-system interface, including the features of overloading, grant-free transmission, as well as non-linear receiver. Specifically, we propose to use single bound to simplify the maximum-likelihood (ML) receiver modelling with only linear computational complexity, while still guaranteeing sufficient accuracy requirement. Extensive simulations verify the correctness of the method under a series of practical assumptions. Evaluation results show that non-orthogonal multiple access schemes such as SCMA with grant-free can provide significant system capacity gain over orthogonal multiple access such as grant-free OFDMA (about 3.5 times as shown in the evaluated scenario) in terms of packet arrival rate at given system outage (defined as 1% packet drop rate). It is noted that the proposed method has been just agreed in 3gpp RAN1 86 meeting and included in the technical report.",

By using two kinds of similarity functions onto the sparse coding bases learned from natural images respectively, we find that these Gabor-like bases inherently contain the topographic information. This method makes those similar bases be close to each other and a topographic organization emerged in the 2-D space. These two kinds of similarity functions are: basis functions similarity in classical sparse model [7] and analysis vectors similarity in encoder/decoder model [2]. Traditional topographic ICA [3] and topographic sparse coding [6] that contain two layer network, however, our proposed model can generate the topographic visualization by using one layer network. The simulation results demonstrate that these two kinds of similarity functions can produce distinct topographic organization of bases, and the analysis vectors similarity provides better results.",

In this study, using the n-peptide composition of reduced amino acid alphabet (RAAA) obtained from structural alphabet named Protein Blocks as feature parameter, the increment of diversity (ID) is firstly developed to predict mitochondrial proteins. By choosing the 1-peptide compositions on the N-terminal regions with 20 residues as the only input vector, the prediction performance achieves 86.86% accuracy with 0.69 Mathew's correlation coefficient (MCC) by the jackknife test. Moreover, by combining with the hydropathy distribution along protein sequence and several reduced amino acid alphabets, we achieved maximum MCC 0.82 with accuracy 92% in the jackknife test by using the developed ID model. When evaluating on an independent dataset our method performs better than existing methods. The results indicate that the ID is a simple and efficient prediction method for mitochondrial proteins of malaria parasite.",

Thus, there is a great need to understand the critical pathways in malaria parasite in order to develop effective drugs and vaccines. In this work, based on the measure of diversity definition, we introduce the increment of diversity fusion (IDF), an improved hybrid method to predict mitochondrial proteins of malaria parasite. We conduct our experiment on an expanded protein dataset where we require the pairwise identity between two proteins is less than 25%. By choosing amino acids composition as the only input vector, we are able to achieve 65.4% accuracy with 0.32 Mathew's correlation coefficient (MCC) for the jackknife test. Further, incorporting the compositions of the N-terminal and C-terminal regions into the input vector, we show that the prediction results are improved to 82.0% accuracy with 0.64 MCC in the jackknife test. In addition, by combining with the several reduced amino acid alphabet and the hydropathy distribution along protein sequence, we achieve maximum 83.4% accuracy with 0.67 MCC in the jackknife test by using the 64 dipeptide compositions of the reduced amino acid alphabet obtained from Protein Blocks method. \u00a9 2011 IEEE.",

Furthermore, using the non-time-locked properties of sustained (de)synchronization, we have developed an asynchronous BCI system for driving a car in 3D virtual reality environment (VRE) based on cumulative incremental control strategy. The extensive real time experiments confirmed that our new approach is able to drive smoothly a virtual car within challenging VRE only by the MI tasks without involving any muscular activities.",

        "abstract": "Transparent computing is an implementation of ubiquitous computing that is aimed at providing active services for users. In transparent computing, the execution (computation) of computer instructions and data is temporally and spatially separated from their storage. Cloud computing solves the issue of data cloudlization, while transparent computing solves the one of software cloudlization. This paper define the concept of Cloudware, and discusses how to deploy Cloudware in cloud environment efficiently. Based on a loosely coupled von Neumann computing model (also called Cygnus Model), we proposes a new platform to construct the PaaS platform which can directly deploy software on the cloud without any modification, while achieving a new model by the browser services, and we call it transparent computing 2.0. By using micro-service architecture, we can achieve such characteristics as good performance, scalable deployment, faults tolerance and flexible configuration. Finally, we presents a Cloudware PaaS platform prototype, called CloudwareHub, and demonstrates the promising of the transparent computing 2.0 with the support of Cloudware technology.",

        "abstract": "We investigated the efficacy of motor imagery-based Brain Computer Interface (MI-based BCI) training for eight stroke patients with severe upper extremity paralysis using longitudinal clinical assessments. The results were compared with those of a control group (n = 7) that only received FES (Functional Electrical Stimulation) treatment besides conventional therapies. During rehabilitation training, changes in the motor function of the upper extremity and in the neurophysiologic electroencephalographic (EEG) were observed for two groups. After 8 weeks of training, a significant improvement in the motor function of the upper extremity for the BCI group was confirmed (p < 0.05 for ARAT), simultaneously with the activation of bilateral cerebral hemispheres. Additionally, event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the affected sensorimotor cortexes (SMCs) was significantly enhanced when compared to the pretraining course, which was only observed in the BCI group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the activation of affected SMC and parietal lobe were determined to contribute to motor function recovery (p < 0.05). In brief, our findings demonstrate that MI-based BCI training can enhance the motor function of the upper extremity for stroke patients by inducing the optimal cerebral motor functional reorganization.",

A common approach to characterizing genome-wide DNA methylation is using Next Generation Sequencing technology to sequence bisulfite treated DNA. The short sequence reads are mapped to the reference genome to determine the methylation statuses of Cs. However, despite intense effort, a much smaller proportion of the reads derived from bisulfite treated DNA (usually about 40-80%) can be mapped than regular short reads mapping (> 90%), and it is unclear what factors lead to this low mapping efficiency.",

        "title": "BisPin and BFAST-Gap: Mapping Bisulfite-Treated Reads",
        "abstract": "Background: BisPin is a new multiprocess bisulfite-treated short DNA read mapper written in Python 2.7.  It performs alignments using BFAST, leveraging its multithreading functionality and thorough hash-based indexing strategy.  BisPin is feature rich and supports directional, nondirectional, PBAT, and hairpin construction strategies.  BisPin approaches read mapping by converting the Cs to Ts and the Gs to As in both the reads and the reference genome.  BisPin uses fast rescoring to disambiguate ambiguously aligned reads for a superior amount of uniquely mapped reads compared to other mappers.  The performance of BisPin was evaluated on both real and simulated data in comparison to other read mappers. BFAST-Gap is a modified version of BFAST meant for Ion Torrent reads.  It uses a parameterized logistic function to determine the weights of the gap open and extension penalties based on the homopolymer run length of the DNA read.  This is because the Ion Torrent sequencing technology can overcall and undercall homopolymer runs.  BisPin works with both BFAST-Gap and BFAST.  BFAST-Gap is compatible with indexes built with BFAST.  There are few mappers that specifically address Ion Torrent data.  BFAST-Gap works with Illumina reads as well. Results: BisPin with BFAST consistently had a higher amount of uniquely mapped reads compared to other mappers on real data using a variety of construction strategies.  Using a hairpin validation strategy, BisPin was superior using the maximum score, and it mapped 73% of reads correctly. BisPin with BFAST-Gap on Ion Torrent reads with a logistic gap open penalty function improved mapping accuracy with real and simulated data.  On simulated bisulfite Ion Torrent data, the area under the curve was improved by approximately seven, and on one real data set, the uniquely mapped percent was improved by seven percent.  BFAST-Gap performed better than TMAP on simulated regular Ion Torrent reads, and TMAP is designed for Ion Torrent reads.  Other read mappers had worse performance. Conclusions: BisPin and BFAST-Gap have consistently good accuracy with a variety of data.  BisPin is feature-rich.  This makes BisPin and BFAST-Gap useful additions to read mapping software.",

Recent large-scale gene expression studies enable us to have a better definition of housekeeping genes and to address the above question in detail. In this study, we examined 1581 human-mouse orthologous gene pairs for their patterns of sequence evolution, contrasting housekeeping genes with tissue-specific genes. Our results show that, in comparison to tissue-specific genes, housekeeping genes on average evolve more slowly and are under stronger selective constraints as reflected by significantly smaller values of Ka/Ks. Besides stronger purifying selection, we explored several other factors that can possibly slow down nonsynonymous rates in housekeeping genes. Although mutational bias might slightly slow the nonsynonymous rates in housekeeping genes, it is unlikely to be the major cause of the rate difference between the two types of genes. The codon usage pattern of housekeeping genes does not seem to differ from that of tissue-specific genes. Moreover, contrary to the old textbook concept, we found that approximately 74% of the housekeeping genes in our study belong to multigene families, not significantly different from that of the tissue-specific genes ( approximately 70%). Therefore, the stronger selective constraints on housekeeping genes are not due to a lower degree of genetic redundancy.",
