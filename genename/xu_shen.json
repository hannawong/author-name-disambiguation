The effect on CCl(4)-induced liver fibrosis was studied using histochemical and biochemical analysis, while the inhibition on HSC was assessed using cell proliferation/apoptosis assay and collagen I production using real-time PCR. The inhibitory effects of Leukamenin F on Akt/mTOR/p70S6K and TGFbeta/Smad pathways was studied using Western blot and cell image analysis.Leukamenin F (0.1-1 mg/kg, ip, q.d.x28) significantly reduced alpha-SMA and collagen specific Sirius red staining areas in CCl(4) -treated mouse livers. This compound at 1-2 micromol/L dose-dependently inhibited alpha-SMA expression, cell proliferation and type I procollagen mRNA expression in activated HSC. Furthermore it inhibited the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway and suppressed TGFbeta -induced Smad2/Smad3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in HSC.Our results demonstrated that Leukamenin F could attenuate CCl(4)-induced liver fibrogenesis in mice as an efficient inhibitor against both HSC proliferation and ECM production. This natural product provides a valuable structural hint for the development of anti-liver fibrosis reagents.",

The complex molecule contains a linear Cu 3 array in which the central copper atom at the crystallographic inversion centre has an octahedral environment and the other two Cu atoms are square pyramidal, each bridged to the central Cu atom via the L group, with the atoms O(1) and N(2) chelating to Cu(1), and the atoms N(1), S and O(2) to Cu(2). The carboxylate groups coordinate to the metal atoms in a unidentate fashion. Complex 2 , [Cu 2 (H 3 L) 2 Cl 2 ](H 2 O) 3 , obtained by the reaction of CuCl 2 \u00b72H 2 O with H 3 L has been characterized by IR, UV, NMR ( 1 H and 13 C) spectra, and TGA and molar conductance measurements.

The structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic analysis and comparison with the data reported in literature. Results: Ten known compounds were isolated and identified as 2-methyl-1,3-dihydroxy-5-tridecylbenzene (1), 1,3-dihydroxy-5-undecylbenzene (2), ergosta-7,22-dien-3\u03b2-ol (3), emodin (4), kaempferol (5), quercetin (6), quercitrin (7), isoquercitrin (8), epigallocatechin (9) and gallic acid (10). Conclusion: All the compounds were isolated from the plant for the first time. Compounds 1 and 2 show inhibitory activity towards PTP1B with the IC50 values of (13.38 \u00b1 1.98) and (10.40 \u00b1 0.88) \u03bcmol\u00b7L-1, respectively.",

        "abstract": "To investigate methods for identifying specific cyclophilin D (CypD) inhibitors derived from quinoxaline, thus developing possible lead compounds to inhibit mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore opening.Kinetic analysis of the CypD/inhibitor interaction was quantitatively performed by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and fluorescence titration (FT) techniques. IC(50) values of these inhibitors were determined by PPIase inhibition activity assays.All the equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of the seven compounds binding to CypD were below 10 mumol/L. The IC(50) values were all consistent with the SPR and FT results. Compounds GW2, 5, 6, and 7 had high inhibition activities against Ca(2+)-dependent rat liver mitochondrial swelling and Ca(2+) uptake/release. Compound GW5 had binding selectivity for CypD over CypA.The agreement between the measured IC(50) values and the results of SPR and FT suggests that these methods are appropriate and powerful methods for identifying CypD inhibitors. The compounds we screened using these methods (GW1-7) are reasonable CypD inhibitors. Its potent ability to inhibit mitochondrial swelling and the binding selectivity of GW5 indicates that GW5 could potentially be used for inhibiting MPT pore opening.",

SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) showed substantial pH and temperature-triggered activity switches, and site-directed mutagenesis analysis of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) revealed that substitutions of His41, Cys145, and His163 resulted in complete loss of enzymatic activity, while replacement of Met162 with Ala caused strongly increased activity.This present work has provided valuable information for understanding the catalytic mechanism of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro).

Taking the putative 3D conformations of two weakly binding RSK2 NTKD inhibitors as query templates, SHAFTS was used to perform 3D similarity based virtual screening because of a lack of crystal structure of RSK2 protein, thus leading to the identification of several novel scaffolds that would have been missed by conventional 2D fingerprint methods. The most potent hit compounds show low micromolar inhibitory activities against RSK2. In particular, one of the hit compounds exhibits potent antimigration activity against the MDA-MB-231 tumor cell. The results exemplified SHAFTS' application in active enrichment and scaffold hopping, which is of general interest for lead identification in drug discovery endeavors and also provides novel scaffolds that lay the foundation for uncovering new RSK2 regulatory mechanisms.",

The potential mechanism underlying the pharmacological actions was also explored.The effect of Withagulatin A on cell viability was evaluated in HSC and LX-2 cells using a sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed using flow cytometry. Type I procollagen gene expression was determined using real-time PCR. Regulation of signaling molecules by Withagulatin A was detected using Western blotting.Primary rat HSCs and the human hepatic stellate cell line LX-2 treated with Withagulatin A (0.625-20 micromol/L) underwent a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability, which was associated with S phase arrest and the induction of cell apoptosis. In addition, the natural product decreased phosphorylation of the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway that controls cell proliferation and survival. Furthermore, Withagulatin A (1, 2 mumol/L) inhibited transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) stimulated type I procollagen gene expression, which was attributable to the suppression of TGF-beta stimulated Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation.Our results demonstrated that Withagulatin A potently inhibited HSC viability and type I procollagen production, thereby implying that this natural product has potential use in the development of anti-fibrogenic reagents for the treatment of hepatic fibrosis.",

        "abstract": "The discovery of cyclophilin A (CypA) inhibitor is now of special interest in the treatment of immunological disorders. In this work, using a strategy integrating focused combinatorial library design, virtual screening, chemical synthesis, and bioassay, a series of novel small molecular CypA inhibitors have been discovered. First, using the fragments taken from our previously discovered CypA inhibitors (Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006, 14, 2209-2224) as building blocks, we designed a focused combinatorial library containing 255 molecules employing the LD1.0 program (J. Comb. Chem. 2005, 7, 398-406) developed by us. Sixteen compounds (1a-e, 2a-b, 3a-b, and 4a-g) were selected by using virtual screening against the X-ray crystal structure of CypA as well as druglike analysis for further synthesis and bioassay. All these sixteen molecules are CypA binders with binding affinities (K(D) values) ranging from 0.076 to 41.0 microM, and five of them (4a, 4c, and 4e-g) are potent CypA inhibitors with PPIase inhibitory activities (IC(50) values) of 0.25-6.43 microM. The hit rates for binders and inhibitors are as high as 100% and 31.25%, respectively. Remarkably, both the binding affinity and inhibitory activity of the most potent compound increase approximately 10 times than that of the most active compound discovered previously. The high hit rate and the high potency of the new CypA inhibitors demonstrated the efficiency of the strategy for focused library design and screening. In addition, the novel chemical entities reported in this study could be leads for discovering new therapies against the CypA pathway.",

        "title": "Enzymatic characterization and crystal structure analysis of the D-alanine-D-alanine ligase from Helicobacter pylori.",
        "abstract": "D-Alanine-D-alanine ligase is the second enzyme in the D-Ala branch of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan assembly, and recognized as an attractive antimicrobial target. In this work, the D-Ala-D-Ala ligase of Helicobacter pylori strain SS1 (HpDdl) was kinetically and structurally characterized. The determined apparent K(m) of ATP (0.87 microM), the K(m1) (1.89 mM) and K(m2) of D-Ala (627 mM), and the k(cat) (115 min(-1)) at pH 8.0 indicated its relatively weak binding affinity and poor catalytic activity against the substrate D-Ala in vitro. However, by complementary assay of expressing HpDdl in Escherichia coli Delta ddl mutant, HpDdl was confirmed to be capable of D-Ala-D-Ala ligating in vivo. Through sequence alignment with other members of the D-Ala-D-X ligase superfamily, HpDdl keeps two conservatively substituted residues (Ile16 and Leu241) and two nonconserved residues (Leu308 and Tyr311) broadly located in the active region of the enzyme. Kinetic analyses against the corresponding HpDdl mutants (I16V, L241Y, L241F, L308T, and Y311S) suggested that these residues, especially Leu308 and Tyr311, might partly contribute to the unique catalytic properties of the enzyme. This was fairly proved by the crystal structure of HpDdl, which revealed that there is a 3(10)-helix (including residues from Gly306 to Leu312) near the D-Ala binding region in the C-terminal domain, where HpDdl has two sequence deletions compared with other homologs. Such 3(10)-helix may participate in D-Ala binding and conformational change of the enzyme. Our present work hopefully provides useful information for understanding the D-Ala-D-Ala ligase of Helicobacter pylori.",

        "title": "Identification of 15d-PGJ2 as an antagonist of farnesoid X receptor: molecular modeling with biological evaluation.",
        "abstract": "15-Deoxy-\u0394(12,14)-PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2) is one of the major metabolites from prostaglandin D2 in arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic pathway. It was determined as a ligand of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) functioning potently in adipocyte development. However, the fact that 15d-PGJ2 exerts also PPAR\u03b3-independent biological actions has highly addressed its multi-target behavior. Here, we identified that 15d-PGJ2 was an antagonist of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), as investigated by surface plasmon resonance, fluorescence quenching and homo time-resolved fluorescence based analyses, and the coactivator-recruitment and luciferase-reporter related investigation. Assay of 15d-PGJ2 regulation on hFXR\u03b1 target genes revealed that treatment of HepG2 cells with 15d-PGJ2 resulted in the stimulation of mRNA expressions of bile-salt export pump (BSEP), and the decrease of cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase (CYP7a1). In addition, functional assays indicated that 15d-PGJ2 promoted the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids in HepG2 cells. Moreover, molecular docking combined with molecular dynamics simulation was applied to develop the possible model of 15d-PGJ2 binding to hFXR\u03b1 ligand binding domain (LBD) at atomic level, and the responsible residues for 15d-PGJ2/hFXR\u03b1-LBD interaction were thereby determined, which were further confirmed by SPR assays against hFXR\u03b1-LBD site-directed mutations. Given that hFXR\u03b1 functions potently in the regulation of hepatic bile acid metabolism and lipid/glucose homeostasis, our current work is expected to help better understand the multi-target features of this PGD2 metabolite in biological pathways, and 15d-PGJ2 as a new discovered FXR antagonist might find its potential application in further anti-hypercholesterol research.",

Here, we discovered that ESD could significantly inhibit the proliferation of different cancer cells and induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M phase in HeLa cell. Moreover, biochemical and biophysical assays revealed that ESD acted as a specific partial agonist against PPARgamma. Molecular docking with site-directed mutagenesis analyses indicated that ESD functioned as a partial agonist of PPARgamma by adopting a distinct binding mode to PPARgamma compared with rosiglitazone. The PPARgamma knockdown results indicated that the inhibition of ESD against the cancer cell proliferation is more possibly through PPARgamma-independent pathway and our findings might supply potent binding features for ESD/PPARgamma interaction at atomic level, and shed light on the potential acting target information for this natural compound.",

To characterize the catalytic mechanism of glucose phosphorylation by GK, we combined molecular modeling, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, experimental mutagenesis and enzymatic kinetic analysis on both wild-type and mutated GK. Our three-dimensional (3D) model of the GK-Mg(2+)-ATP-glucose (GMAG) complex, is in agreement with a large number of mutagenesis data, and elucidates atomic information of the catalytic site in GK for glucose phosphorylation. A 10-ns MD simulation of the GMAG complex revealed that Lys169 plays a dominant role in glucose phosphorylation. This prediction was verified by experimental mutagenesis of GK (K169A) and enzymatic kinetic analyses of glucose phosphorylation. QM/MM calculations were further used to study the role of Lys169 in the catalytic mechanism of the glucose phosphorylation and we found that Lys169 enhances the binding of GK with both ATP and glucose by serving as a bridge between ATP and glucose. More importantly, Lys169 directly participates in the glucose phosphorylation as a general acid catalyst. Our findings provide mechanistic details of glucose phorphorylation catalyzed by GK, and are important for understanding the pathogenic mechanism of MODY.",

        "abstract": "RhoA is a member of Rho GTPases, a subgroup of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins. RhoA, as an important regulator of diverse cellular signaling pathways, plays significant roles in cytoskeletal organization, transcription, and cell-cycle progression. The RhoA/ROCK inhibitors have emerged as a new promising treatment for cardiovascular diseases. However, to date, RhoA inhibitors are macromolecules, and to our knowledge, small molecular-based inhibitors have not been reported. In this study, a series of first-in-class small molecular RhoA inhibitors have been discovered by using structure-based virtual screening in conjunction with chemical synthesis and bioassay. Virtual screening of \u223c200,000 compounds, followed by SPR-based binding affinity assays resulted in three compounds with binding affinities to RhoA at the micromolar level (compounds 1-3). Compound 1 was selected for further structure modifications in considering binding activity and synthesis ease. Fourty-one new compounds (1, 12a-v, 13a-h, and 14a-j) were designed and synthesized accordingly. It was found that eight (12a, 12j, 14a, 14b, 14d, 14e, 14 g, and 14h) showed high RhoA inhibition activities with IC(50) values of 1.24 to 3.00 \u03bcM. A pharmacological assay indicated that two compounds (14g and 14 h) demonstrated noticeable vasorelaxation effects against PE-induced contraction in thoracic aorta artery rings and served as good leads for developing more potent cardiovascular agents.",

        "title": "Structural basis for retinoic X receptor repression on the tetramer.",
        "abstract": "Retinoic X receptor (RXR) is a master nuclear receptor in the processes of cell development and homeostasis. Unliganded RXR exists in an autorepressed tetramer, and agonists can induce RXR dimerization and coactivator recruitment for activation. However, the molecular mechanisms involving the corepressor recruitment and antagonist-mediated repression of RXR are still elusive. Here we report the crystal structure of RXR\u03b1 ligand-binding domain (LBD) complexed with silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) corepressor motif. As the first structural report on the unliganded nuclear receptor bound to the corepressor motif, RXR\u03b1LBD-SMRT exhibits a significant structural rearrangement, compared with apoRXR\u03b1LBD tetramer. To elucidate further the molecular determinants for RXR repression by its antagonist, we also determine the crystal structure of RXR\u03b1LBD-SMRT complexed with the identified antagonist rhein. In the structure, two rhein molecules and two SMRT peptides are in the RXR\u03b1LBD tetramer, different from the case in RXR\u03b1LBD-SMRT structure, where four SMRT peptides bind to RXR\u03b1LBD tetramer. It seems that rhein induces a displacement of SMRT motif by activation function 2 (AF-2) motif binding to the receptor. Combining our current work with the published results, structural superposition of RXR\u03b1LBDs in different states reveals that RXR uses an overlapped binding site for coactivator, corepressor, and AF-2 motifs, whereas the AF-2 motif adopts different conformations for agonist or antagonist interaction and coactivator or corepressor recruitment. Taken together, we thus propose a molecular model of RXR repression on the tetramer.",

        "abstract": "Over-activation of TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway and uncontrolled cell proliferation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) play pivotal roles in liver fibrogenesis, while the protein serine/threonine phosphatase PP2C\u03b1 was reported to negatively regulate TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway and cell cycle. Our study aimed to investigate the role of PP2C\u03b1 in liver fibrogenesis.The effects of PP2C\u03b1 activation on liver fibrosis were investigated in human HSCs and primary rat HSCs in vitro using western blotting, real-time PCR, nuclear translocation, cell viability and cell cycle analyses. The antifibrogenic effects in carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))- and bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced mice in vivo were assessed using biochemical, histological and immunohistochemical analyses. The results demonstrated that activation of PP2C\u03b1 by overexpression or the new discovered small molecular activator NPLC0393 terminated TGF\u03b2-Smad3 and TGF\u03b2-p38 signaling pathways, induced cell cycle arrest in HSCs and decreased \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression, collagen deposition and hepatic hydroxyproline (HYP) level in CCl(4)- and BDL-induced mice.Our findings suggested that PP2C\u03b1 activation might be an attractive new strategy for treating liver fibrosis while the small molecular activator NPLC0393 might represent a lead compound for antifibrogenic drug development. Moreover, our study might provide the first evidence for the role of PP2C family members in the fibrotic disease.",

        "abstract": "Cyclophilin A (CypA) is a member of cyclophilins, a family of the highly homologous peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases), which can bind to cyclosporin A (CsA). CypA plays critical roles in various biological processes, including protein folding, assembly, transportation, regulation of neuron growth, and HIV replication. The discovery of CypA inhibitor is now of a great special interest in the treatment of immunological disorders. In this study, a series of novel small molecular CypA inhibitors have been discovered by using structure-based virtual screening in conjunction with chemical synthesis and bioassay. The SPECS_1 database containing 85,000 small molecular compounds was searched by virtual screening against the crystal structure of human CypA. After SPR-based binding affinity assay, 15 compounds were found to show binding affinities to CypA at submicro-molar or micro-molar level (compounds 1-15). Seven compounds were selected as the starting point for the further structure modification in considering binding activity, synthesis difficulty, and structure similarity. We thus synthesized 40 new small molecular compounds (1-6, 15, 16a-q, 17a-d, and 18a-l), and four of which (compounds 16b, 16h, 16k, and 18g) showed high CypA PPIase inhibition activities with IC50s of 2.5-6.2 microM. Pharmacological assay indicated that these four compounds demonstrated somewhat inhibition activities against the proliferation of spleen cells.",

        "abstract": "Deregulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays a central role in tumor formation and progression, providing validated targets for cancer therapy. S9, a hybrid of alpha-methylene-gamma-lactone and 2-phenyl indole compound, possessed potent activity against this pathway.Effects of S9 on PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway were determined by Western blot, immunofluorescence staining and in vitro kinas assay. The interactions between tubulin and S9 were investigated by polymerization assay, CD, and SPR assay. The potential binding modes between S9 and PI3K, mTOR or tubulin were analyzed by molecular modeling. Anti-tumor activity of S9 was evaluated in tumor cells and in nude mice bearing human cancer xenografts. S9 abrogated EGF-activated PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling cascade and Akt translocation to cellular membrane in human tumor cells. S9 possessed inhibitory activity against both PI3K and mTOR with little effect on other tested 30 kinases. S9 also completely impeded hyper-phosphorylation of Akt as a feedback of inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin. S9 unexpectedly arrested cells in M phase other than G1 phase, which was distinct from compounds targeting PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. Further study revealed that S9 inhibited tubulin polymerization via binding to colchicine-binding site of tubulin and resulted in microtubule disturbance. Molecular modeling indicated that S9 could potentially bind to the kinase domains of PI3K p110alpha subunit and mTOR, and shared similar hydrophobic interactions with colchicines in the complex with tubulin. Moreover, S9 induced rapid apoptosis in tumor cell, which might reflect a synergistic cooperation between blockade of both PI3-Akt-mTOR signaling and tubulin cytoskeleton. Finally, S9 displayed potent antiproliferative activity in a panel of tumor cells originated from different tissue types including drug-resistant cells and in nude mice bearing human tumor xenografts.Taken together, S9 targets both PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling and microtubule cytoskeleton, which combinatorially contributes its antitumor activity and provides new clues for anticancer drug design and development.",

        "abstract": "Bcl-2 family proteins regulate apoptosis through their homo- and heterodimerization. By protein sequence analysis and structural comparison, we have identified a conserved hydrophobic core at the BH1 and BH2 domains of Bcl-2 family proteins. The hydrophobic core is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions among the residues of Trp137, Ile140, Trp181, Ile182, Trp188 and Phe191 in Bcl-x(L). Destabilization of the hydrophobic core can promote the protein unfolding and pore formation in synthetic lipid vesicles. Interestingly, though the hydrophobic core does not participate in binding with BH3 domain of pro-apoptotic proteins, disruption of the hydrophobic core can reduce the affinity of Bcl-x(L) with BH3-domain peptide by changing the conformation of Bcl-x(L) C-terminal residues that are involved in the peptide interaction. The BH3-domain peptide binding affinity and pore forming propensity of Bcl-x(L) were correlated to its death-repressor activity, which provides new information to help study the regulatory mechanism of anti-apoptotic proteins. Meanwhile, as the tryptophans are conserved in the hydrophobic core, in vitro binding assay based on FRET of \"Trp-->AEDANS\" can be devised to screen for new modulators targeting anti-apoptotic proteins as well as \"multi-BH domains\" pro-apoptotic proteins.",

The blood glucose levels of diabetic db/db mice were measured using a blood glucose level monitor and the data were statistically analyzed by NDST8.8W software.By using the clinical drug rosiglitazone as a positive control, it was found that the PPARg agonistic activity of SmE at a concentration of 50 microg/L was approximately half that of 35.7 microg/L (0.1 micromol/L) of rosiglitazone. At the dose of 1000 mg/kg, SmE remarkably decreased the blood glucose concentration of db/db mice from (15.26+/-2.98) to (7.58+/-2.20) mmol/L, and reduced the blood glucose levels by 55.49% compared with the control group (P<0.01).SmE shows agonistic activity to PPARg and can ameliorate the blood glucose levels of diabetic db/db mice. SmE may be thus used as a potential agent for diabetes therapy.",

        "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is an important therapeutic drug target against several diseases such as diabetes, inflammation, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and cancer. Ligand binding to PPARgamma is responsible for controlling the biological functions, and developing new technology to measure ligand-PPARgamma binding is significant for both the function study of the receptor and ligand discovery. In this study, we exploited an efficient approach for the discovery of PPARgamma agonist and antagonist via a yeast two-hybrid system based on the fact that PPARgamma interacts with the coactivator CBP (CREP-binding protein) ligand-dependently. We employed the MEL1 reporter gene instead of the traditionally used LacZ gene to evaluate the protein-protein interactions by conducting a convenient alpha-galactosidase assay in the yeast strain AH109 with genes of PPARgamma-LBD (ligand-binding domain) and CBP N terminus introduced. With this built screening platform, the EC(50) values of the PPARgamma agonists rosiglitazone, troglitazone, pioglitazone, indomethacin, 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)), and GI262570 were investigated, and the quantitatively antagonistic effect by IC(50) of the PPARgamma typical antagonist GW9662 on the rosiglitazone agonistic activity was fully examined. The reliability of this presented system evaluated by the comparable agreement of EC(50) and IC(50) values for the test compounds with the reported ones indicated that this yeast two-hybrid-based approach is powerful for PPARgamma agonist and antagonist screening. In addition, because this screening system is designed for use in a microtiter plate format where numerous chemicals could be readily screened, it is hoped that this yeast two-hybrid screening approach may be adaptable for high-throughput settings.",

SK has been developed as a promising target for the discovery of antibacterial agents. In this report, two small molecular inhibitors (compound 1, 3-methoxy-4-{[2-({2-methoxy-4-[(4-oxo-2-thioxo-1,3-thiazolidin-5-ylidene)methyl]phenoxy}methyl)benzyl]oxy}benzaldehyde; compound 2, 5-bromo-2-(5-{[1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,5-dioxo-4-pyrazolidinylidene]methyl}-2-furyl)benzoic acid) against Helicobacter pylori SK (HpSK) were successfully identified with IC(50) values of 5.5+/-1.2 and 6.4+/-0.4 microM, respectively. The inhibition kinetics shows that compound 1 is a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to both shikimate and MgATP, and compound 2 is a competitive inhibitor toward shikimate and noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to MgATP. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology based analysis reveals that the equilibrium dissociation constants (K(D)s) of compounds 1 and 2 with HpSK enzyme are 4.39 and 3.74 microM, respectively. The molecular modeling and docking of two inhibitors with HpSK reveals that the active site of HpSK is rather roomy and deep, forming an L-shape channel on the surface of the protein, and compound 1 prefers the corner area of L-shape channel, while compound 2 binds the short arm of the channel of SK in the binding interactions. It is expected that our current work might supply useful information for the development of novel SK inhibitors.",

Helicobacter pylori is a human pathogen associated with a number of human diseases. Here, we cloned and purified the ThyX enzyme from H. pylori SS1 strain (HpThyX). The recombinant HpThyX was discovered to exhibit the maximum activity at pH 8.5, and K(m) values of the two substrates dUMP and CH(2) H(4) folate were determined to be 15.3 \u00b1 1.25 \u03bcM and 0.35 \u00b1 0.18 mM, respectively. The analyzed crystal structure of HpThyX with the cofactor FAD and the substrate dUMP (at 2.31 \u00c5) revealed that the enzyme was a tetramer bound to four dUMP and four FAD molecules. Different from the catalytic feature of the classical thymidylate synthase (ThyA), N5 atom of the FAD functioned as a nucleophile in the catalytic reaction instead of Ser84 and Ser85 residues. Our current work is expected to help better understand the structural and enzymatic features of HpThyX thus further providing valuable information for anti-H. pylori inhibitor discovery.",

        "abstract": "Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) negatively regulates insulin signaling, and PTP1B inhibitors have been seen as promising therapeutic agents against obesity and type 2 diabetes. Here we report that the marine natural product hyrtiosal, from the marine sponge Hyrtios erectus, has been discovered to act as a PTP1B inhibitor and to show extensive cellular effects on PI3K/AKT activation, glucose transport, and TGFbeta/Smad2 signaling. This inhibitor wad able to inhibit PTP1B activity in dose-dependent fashion, with an IC(50) value of 42 microM in a noncompetitive inhibition mode. Further study with an IN Cell Analyzer 1000 cellular fluorescence imaging instrument showed that hyrtiosal displayed potent activity in abolishing the retardation of AKT membrane translocation caused by PTP1B overexpression in CHO cells. Moreover, it was found that this newly identified PTP1B inhibitor could dramatically enhance the membrane translocation of the key glucose transporter Glut4 in PTP1B-overexpressed CHO cells. Additionally, in view of our recent finding that PTP1B was able to modulate insulin-mediated inhibition of Smad2 activation, hyrtiosal was also tested for its capabilities in the regulation of Smad2 activity through the PI3K/AKT pathway. The results showed that hyrtiosal could effectively facilitate insulin inhibition of Smad2 activation. Our current study is expected to supply new clues for the discovery of PTP1B inhibitors from marine natural products, while the newly identified PTP1B inhibitor hyrtiosal might serve as a potential lead compound for further research.",

Protein-protein interaction analysis using bioinformatics tools indicated that SARS_NP may bind to human cyclophilin A (hCypA), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology revealed this binding with the equilibrium dissociation constant ranging from 6 to 160nM. The probable binding sites of these two proteins were detected by modeling the three-dimensional structure of the SARS_NP-hCypA complex, from which the important interaction residue pairs between the proteins were deduced. Mutagenesis experiments were carried out for validating the binding model, whose correctness was assessed by the observed effects on the binding affinities between the proteins. The reliability of the binding sites derived by the molecular modeling was confirmed by the fact that the computationally predicted values of the relative free energies of the binding for SARS_NP (or hCypA) mutants to the wild-type hCypA (or SARS_NP) are in good agreement with the data determined by SPR. Such presently observed SARS_NP-hCypA interaction model might provide a new hint for facilitating the understanding of another possible SARS-CoV infection pathway against human cell.",

METHODS: On the basis of comparative genomics, the homology search, phylogenetic analyses, and multi-sequence alignment were used to predict CD13 related interacting domains and binding sites in the S protein of SARS_CoV. Molecular modeling and docking simulation methods were employed to address the interaction feature between CD13 and S protein of SARS_CoV in validating the bioinformatics predictions. RESULTS: Possible binding sites in the SARS_CoV S protein to CD13 have been mapped out by using bioinformatics analysis tools. The binding for one protein-protein interaction pair (D757-R761 motif of the SARS_CoV S protein to P585-A653 domain of CD13) has been simulated by molecular modeling and docking simulation methods. CONCLUSION: CD13 may be a possible receptor of the SARS_CoV S protein, which may be associated with the SARS infection. This study also provides a possible strategy for mapping the possible binding receptors of the proteins in a genome.",

The enzyme has been shown by X-ray crystallography to undergo significant pH-dependent conformational changes. Here, we assess the conformational flexibility of the M(pro) by analysis of multiple crystal structures (including two new crystal forms) and by molecular dynamics (MD) calculations. The MD simulations take into account the different protonation states of two histidine residues in the substrate-binding site and explain the pH-activity profile of the enzyme. The low enzymatic activity of the M(pro) monomer and the need for dimerization are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "Alanine racemase (Alr) is an important enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion of L-alanine and D-alanine, an essential building block in the peptidoglycan biosynthesis. For the small size of the Alr active site, its conserved substrate entryway has been proposed as a potential choice for drug design. In this work, we fully analyzed the crystal structures of the native, the D-cycloserine-bound, and four mutants (P219A, E221A, E221K, and E221P) of biosynthetic Alr from Escherichia coli (EcAlr) and studied the potential roles in substrate orientation for the key residues involved in the substrate entryway in conjunction with the enzymatic assays. Structurally, it was discovered that EcAlr is similar to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa catabolic Alr in both overall and active site geometries. Mutation of the conserved negatively charged residue aspartate 164 or glutamate 165 at the substrate entryway could obviously reduce the binding affinity of enzyme against the substrate and decrease the turnover numbers in both D- to L-Ala and L- to D-Ala directions, especially when mutated to lysine with the opposite charge. However, mutation of Pro219 or Glu221 had only negligible or a small influence on the enzymatic activity. Together with the enzymatic and structural investigation results, we thus proposed that the negatively charged residues Asp164 and Glu165 around the substrate entryway play an important role in substrate orientation with cooperation of the positively charged Arg280 and Arg300 on the opposite monomer. Our findings are expected to provide some useful structural information for inhibitor design targeting the substrate entryway of Alr.",

        "abstract": "Coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein envelops the genomic RNA to form long helical nucleocapsid during virion assembly. Since N protein oligomerization is usually a crucial step in this process, characterization of such an oligomerization will help in the understanding of the possible mechanisms for nucleocapsid formation. The N protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was recently discovered to self-associate by its carboxyl terminus. In this study, to further address the detailed understanding of the association feature of this C-terminus, its oligomerization was systematically investigated by size exclusion chromatography and chemical cross-linking assays. Our results clearly indicated that the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV N protein could form not only dimers but also trimers, tetramers, and hexamers. Further analyses against six deletion mutants showed that residues 343-402 were necessary and sufficient for this C-terminus oligomerization. Although this segment contains many charged residues, differences in ionic strength have no effects on its oligomerization, indicating the absence of electrostatic force in SARS-CoV N protein C-terminus self-association. Gel shift assay results revealed that the SARS-CoV N protein C-terminus is also able to associate with nucleic acids and residues 363-382 are the responsible interaction partner, demonstrating that this fragment might involve genomic RNA binding sites. The fact that nucleic acid binding could promote the SARS-CoV N protein C-terminus to form high-order oligomers implies that the oligomeric SARS-CoV N protein probably combines with the viral genomic RNA in triggering long nucleocapsid formation.",

It has been extensively proved that only the dimeric enzyme is active. Here we discovered that two adjacent mutations (Ser139_Ala and Phe140_Ala) on the dimer interface resulted in completely different crystal structures of the enzyme, demonstrating the distinct roles of these two residues in maintaining the active conformation of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro). S139A is a monomer that is structurally similar to the two reported monomers G11A and R298A. However, this mutant still retains a small fraction of dimer in solution, which might account for its remaining activity. F140A is a dimer with the most collapsed active pocket discovered so far, well-reflecting the stabilizing role of this residue. Moreover, a plausible dimerization mechanism was also deduced from structural analysis. Our work is expected to provide insight on the dimerization-function relationship of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro).",

Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the key residues of SARS E protein were much conserved compared to the E proteins of other coronaviruses. In particular, the primary amino acid sequence of SARS E protein is much more similar to that of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and other mammal coronaviruses. The transmembrane (TM) segment of the SARS E protein is relatively more conserved in the whole protein than other regions.The success of expressing the SARS E protein is a good starting point for investigating the structure and functions of this protein and SARS coronavirus itself as well. The SARS E protein may fold in water solution in a similar way as it in membrane-water mixed environment. It is possible that beta-sheet I of the SARS E protein interacts with the membrane surface via hydrogen bonding, this beta-sheet may uncoil to a random structure in water solution.",

        "abstract": "Shikimate dehydrogenase (SDH) is the fourth enzyme involved in the shikimate pathway. It catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of 3-dehydroshikimate to shikimate, and has been developed as a promising target for the discovery of antimicrobial agent. In this report, we identified a new aroE gene encoding SDH from Helicobacter pylori strain SS1. The recombinant H. pylori shikimate dehydrogenase (HpSDH) was cloned, expressed, and purified in Escherichia coli system. The enzymatic characterization of HpSDH demonstrates its activity with k(cat) of 7.7 s(-1) and K(m) of 0.148 mm toward shikimate, k(cat) of 7.1 s(-1) and K(m) of 0.182 mm toward NADP, k(cat) of 5.2 s(-1) and K(m) of 2.9 mm toward NAD. The optimum pH of the enzyme activity is between 8.0 and 9.0, and the optimum temperature is around 60 degrees C. Using high throughput screening against our laboratory chemical library, five compounds, curcumin (1), 3-(2-naphthyloxy)-4-oxo-2-(trifluoromethyl)-4H-chromen-7-yl 3-chlorobenzoate (2), butyl 2-{[3-(2-naphthyloxy)-4-oxo-2-(trifluoromethyl)-4H-chromen-7-yl]oxy}propanoate (3), 2-({2-[(2-{[2-(2,3-dimethylanilino)-2-oxoethyl]sulfanyl}-1,3-benzothiazol-6-yl)amino]-2-oxoethyl}sulfanyl)-N-(2-naphthyl)acetamide (4), and maesaquinone diacetate (5) were discovered as HpSDH inhibitors with IC(50) values of 15.4, 3.9, 13.4, 2.9, and 3.5 microm, respectively. Further investigation indicates that compounds 1, 2, 3, and 5 demonstrate noncompetitive inhibition pattern, and compound 4 displays competitive inhibition pattern with respect to shikimate. Compounds 1, 4, and 5 display noncompetitive inhibition mode, and compounds 2 and 3 show competitive inhibition mode with respect to NADP. Antibacterial assays demonstrate that compounds 1, 2, and 5 can inhibit the growth of H. pylori with MIC of 16, 16, and 32 microg.mL(-1), respectively. This current work is expected to favor better understanding the features of SDH and provide useful information for the development of novel antibiotics to treat H. pylori-associated infection.",

        "abstract": "The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is an important therapeutic drug target for several conditions, including diabetes, inflammation, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and cancer. It is shown that an antagonist or partial agonist of PPARgamma has attractive potential applications in the discovery of novel antidiabetic agents that may retain efficacious insulin-sensitizing properties and minimize potential side effects. In this work, the dipeptide H-Trp-Glu-OH (G3335) was discovered to be a novel PPARgamma antagonist. Biacore 3000 results based on the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique showed that G3335 exhibits a highly specific binding affinity against PPARgamma (K(D) = 8.34 microM) and is able to block rosiglitazone, a potent PPARgamma agonist, in the stimulation of the interaction between the PPARgamma ligand-binding domain (LBD) and RXRalpha-LBD. Yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated that G3335 exhibits strong antagonistic activity (IC50 = 8.67 microM) in perturbing rosiglitazone in the promotion of the PPARgamma-LBD-CBP interaction. Moreover, in transactivation assays, G3335 was further confirmed as an antagonist of PPARgamma in that G3335 could competitively bind to PPARgamma against 0.1 microM rosiglitazone to repress reporter-gene expression with an IC50 value of 31.9 muM. In addition, homology modeling and molecular-docking analyses were performed to investigate the binding mode of PPARgamma-LBD with G3335 at the atomic level. The results suggested that residues Cys285, Arg288, Ser289, and His449 in PPARgamma play vital roles in PPARgamma-LBD-G3335 binding. The significance of Cys285 for PPARgamma-LBD-G3335 interaction was further demonstrated by PPARgamma point mutation (PPARgamma-LBD-Cys285Ala). It is hoped our current work will provide a powerful approach for the discovery of PPARgamma antagonists, and that G3335 might be developed as a possible lead compound in diabetes research.",

        "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis is a deleterious consequence of hypertension which may further advance to heart failure and increased matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) contributes to the underlying mechanism. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies to attenuate the effects of MMP-9 are urgently needed. In the present study, we characterize salvianolic acid A (SalA) as a novel MMP-9 inhibitor at molecular, cellular and animal level. We expressed a truncated form of MMP-9 which contains only the catalytic domain (MMP-9 CD), and used this active protein for enzymatic kinetic analysis and Biacore detection. Data generated from these assays indicated that SalA functioned as the strongest competitive inhibitor of MMP-9 among 7 phenolic acids from Salvia miltiorrhiza. In neonatal cardiac fibroblast, SalA inhibited fibroblast migration, blocked myofibroblast transformation, inhibited secretion of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) as well as collagen induced by MMP-9 CD. Functional effects of SalA inhibition on MMP-9 was further confirmed in cultured cardiac H9c2 cell overexpressing MMP-9 in vitro and in heart of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) in vivo. Moreover, SalA treatment in SHR resulted in decreased heart fibrosis and attenuated heart hypertrophy. These results indicated that SalA is a novel inhibitor of MMP-9, thus playing an inhibitory role in hypertensive fibrosis. Further studies to develop SalA and its analogues for their potential clinical application of cardioprotection are warranted.",

In this work, we reported a novel quinoxaline derivative, 2,3-di(furan-2-yl)-6-(3-N,N-diethylcarbamoyl-piperidino)carbonylamino quinoxaline (DC838, 3), which was confirmed to be a potent inhibitor against human CypA. By using the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and fluorescence titration techniques, the kinetic analysis of CypA/DC838 interaction was quantitatively performed. CypA peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity inhibition assay showed that DC838 demonstrated highly CypA PPIase inhibitory activity. In vivo assay results showed that DC838 could inhibit mouse spleen cell proliferation induced by concanavalin A (Con A). Molecular docking simulation further elucidated the specific DC838 binding to CypA at the atomic level. The current work should provide useful information in the discovery of immunosuppressor based on CypA inhibitor.",

        "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a major causative factor for gastrointestinal illnesses, H. pylori peptide deformylase (HpPDF) catalyzes the removal of formyl group from the N-terminus of nascent polypeptide chains, which is essential for H. pylori survival and is considered as a promising drug target for anti-H. pylori therapy. Propolis, a natural antibiotic from honeybees, is reported to have an inhibitory effect on the growth of H. pylori in vitro. In addition, previous studies suggest that the main active constituents in the propolis are phenolic compounds. Therefore, we evaluated a collection of phenolic compounds derived from propolis for enzyme inhibition against HpPDF. Our study results show that Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), one of the main medicinal components of propolis, is a competitive inhibitor against HpPDF, with an IC50 value of 4.02 \u03bcM. Furthermore, absorption spectra and crystal structural characterization revealed that different from most well known PDF inhibitors, CAPE block the substrate entrance, preventing substrate from approaching the active site, but CAPE does not have chelate interaction with HpPDF and does not disrupt the metal-dependent catalysis. Our study provides valuable information for understanding the potential anti-H. pylori mechanism of propolis, and CAPE could be served as a lead compound for further anti-H. pylori drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the inhibition features of the natural product juglone (5- hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) against the three key enzymes from Helicobacter pylori (cystathionine gamma-synthase [HpCGS], malonyl-CoA:acyl carrier protein transacylase [HpFabD], and beta-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase [HpFabZ]).An enzyme inhibition assay against HpCGS was carried out by using a continuous coupled spectrophotometric assay approach. The inhibition assay of HpFabD was performed based on the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase-coupled system, while the inhibition assay for HpFabZ was monitored by detecting the decrease in absorbance at 260 nm with crotonoyl-CoA conversion to beta -hydroxybutyryl-CoA. The juglone/FabZ complex crystal was obtained by soaking juglone into the HpFabZ crystal, and the X-ray crystal structure of the complex was analyzed by molecular replacement approach.Juglone was shown to potently inhibit HpCGS, HpFabD, and HpFabZ with the half maximal inhibitory concentration IC50 values of 7.0 +/-0.7, 20 +/-1, and 30 +/-4 micromol/L, respectively. An inhibition-type study indicated that juglone was a non-competitive inhibitor of HpCGS against O-succinyl- L-homoserine (Ki=alphaKi=24 micromol/L), an uncompetitive inhibitor of HpFabD against malonyl-CoA (alphaKi=7.4 micromol/L), and a competitive inhibitor of HpFabZ against crotonoyl-CoA (Ki=6.8 micromol/L). Moreover, the crystal structure of the HpFabZ/juglone complex further revealed the essential binding pattern of juglone against HpFabZ at the atomic level.HpCGS, HpFabD, and HpFabZ are potential targets of juglone.",

MCAT has been considered as an attractive drug target in the discovery of antibacterial agents. In this study, the crystal structure of MCAT from Helicobacter pylori (Hp) at 2.5 angstroms resolution is reported, and the interaction of HpMCAT with HpACP is extensively investigated by using computational docking, GST-pull-down, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology-based assays. The crystal structure results reveal that HpMCAT has a compact folding composed of a large subdomain with a similar core as in alpha/beta hydrolases, and a similar ferredoxin-like small subdomain as in acylphosphatases. The docking result suggests two positively charged areas near the entrance of the active site of HpMCAT as the ACP-binding region. Binding assay research shows that HpMCAT demonstrates a moderately binding ability against HpACP. The solved 3D structure of HpMCAT is expected to supply useful information for the structure-based discovery of novel inhibitors against MCAT, and the quantitative study of HpMCAT interaction with HpACP is hoped to give helpful hints in the understanding of the detailed catalytic mechanisms for HpMCAT.",

To date, only a few such inhibitors have been reported. Here structure-based virtual screening was performed to search for the inhibitors from an in-house library of natural products and their derivatives. Among the 38 compounds selected by our strategy, 18 hits were discovered. The two most potent inhibitors showed IC(50) values at 0.32 and 0.26 \u03bcM, respectively. Three compounds were subsequently selected for anti-HIV assays, among which (E)-3-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)prop-2-en-1-one (NPD170) showed the highest antiviral activity (EC(50) = 1.81 \u03bcM). The antiviral mechanism of these compounds was further explored, and the results validated that the compounds interrupted the binding of transfected IN to endogenous LEDGF/p75.

        "abstract": "The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is reported to function in encapsidating the viral genomic RNA into helical nucleocapsid, and its self-association is believed to be vital in coating the viral genomic RNA. Characterization of SARS-CoV N multimerization may thereby help us better understand the coronavirus assembly. In the current work, using the yeast two-hybrid technique, an unexpected interaction between residues 1-210 and 211-290 (central region) of the SARS-CoV N protein was detected, and SPR results further revealed that the SR-rich motif (amino acids 183-197) of SARS-CoV N protein is responsible for such an interaction. Chemical cross-linking and gel-filtration analyses indicated that the residues 283-422 of the SARS-CoV N protein have multimeric ability, although the full-length N protein is prone to exist predominantly as dimers. In addition, the multimeric ability of the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV N protein could be weakened by the SR-rich motif interaction with the central region (amino acids 211-290). All of these data suggested that the SR-rich motif of the SARS-CoV N protein might play an import role in the transformation of the SARS-CoV N protein between the dimer and multimer during its binding to its central region for self-association or dissociation. This current paper will hopefully provide some new ideas in studying SARS-CoV N multimerization.",

        "title": "A new \u03b2-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein dehydratase (FabZ) from Helicobacter pylori: Molecular cloning, enzymatic characterization, and structural modeling",
        "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori is a gram-negative pathogenic bacterium that causes peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer, and studies of the related potent enzymes associated with this bacterium are urgent for the discovery of novel drug targets. In bacteria, \u03b2-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) dehydratase (FabZ) is a potent enzyme in fatty acid biosynthesis and catalyzes the dehydration of \u03b2-hydroxyacyl-ACP to trans -2-acyl-ACP. In this study, the cloning and enzymatic characterization of FabZ from H. pylori strain SS1 (HpFabZ) were reported, and the gene sequence of Hp fab Z was deposited in the GenBank database (Accession No. AY725427 ). Enzyme dynamic analysis showed that HpFabZ had a K m of 82.6 \u00b1 4.3 \u03bcM toward its substrate analog crotonoyl-CoA. Dynamic light scattering and native-PAGE investigations suggested that HpFabZ exists as hexamer in native state. Enzymatic characterization and thermal-induced unfolding analysis based on circular dichroism spectral measurements indicated that HpFabZ is very stable against high temperature (90 \u00b0C). Such a high stability of HpFabZ was well elucidated by the strong H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions among the HpFabZ hexamer as investigated in the modeled HpFabZ hexamer structure. Our current study is hoped to provide useful information in better understanding the FabZ of H. pylori strain and further supply possible hints in the discovery of anti-bacterial compounds using HpFabZ as target. Keywords Fatty acid biosynthesis Helicobacter pylori \u03b2-Hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein dehydratase (FabZ) Molecular cloning Unfolding Structural modeling In recent years, bacterial diseases and anti-biotic-resistant bacterial infections are globally increasing. They have become worldwide problems and governed the urgent needs for new drug design based on novel anti-bacterial targets [1\u20134] . Bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS) is an essential process for assembly of important cellular components including phospholipids, lipoproteins, lipopolysaccharides, and mycolic acids [1,5] . In general, FAS is organized into two different pathways (FAS I and FAS II) based on the architecture of the enzymes involved [2,6] . In FAS I pathway, the involved synthases found in fungi and mammals are large multifunctional enzymes with multiple domains that catalyze various reactions of FAS. In contrast, the FAS for bacteria and plant chloroplasts belongs to the FAS II pathway, where the acyl chain covalently attached to the acyl carrier protein (ACP) is elongated with four enzymes catalyzing consecutively ( Scheme 1 ) [7\u20139] . Since most enzymes within this dissociated bacterial system are distinctly different from the large, multifunctional ones of mammals and are generally conserved among species, various ways may exist for designing type-selective anti-bacterial drugs by targeting these enzymes [6,10] . Within the FAS II pathway, the dehydration from \u03b2-hydroxyacyl-ACP to trans -2-acyl-ACP is catalyzed by the enzyme FabA or FabZ [11,12] . FabA is only found in gram-negative bacteria, which produces unsaturated fatty acids and is always found with its partner, FabB, a condensing enzyme that is also essential for unsaturated fatty acid formation. But in the genomes of gram-positive bacteria, and in some anaerobes, fab A and fab B homologs are not available [1] . However, fab Z is ubiquitous, which was first discovered as a suppressor of temperature-sensitive mutants in lipid A biosynthesis. In gram-negative bacteria, fab Z gene is generally found within a cluster of lipid A biosynthesis, whereas in gram-positive bacteria, it is found within a cluster of fab genes [11,13] . FabZ is the primary dehydratase that participates in the elongation cycles of saturated and unsaturated fatty acid synthesis [11,12,14,15] , and FabA is a bifunctional enzyme and carries out an additional isomerization reaction. Even though FabZ only catalyzes the dehydration reaction, it plays a potent role in FAS. FabZ is more active against short-chain substrates, and its overall activity decreases as the chain length increased [16,17] . Structurally, instead of an Asp for FabA, there is a Glu for FabZ in the active site. Such a difference is generally regarded as the pivotal reason that FabA is capable of isomerization while FabZ fails [17] . In fact, the essential and broad distribution of FabZ in the bacterial FAS pathway has made it a potential target for discovering anti-bacterial compounds [14,17] . However, up to now, only the detailed enzymatic characterization of FabZ for Plasmodium falciparum (PfFabZ) is available [14] , and the crystal structure of FabZ for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaFabZ) is recently reported [17] . Helicobacter pylori is a gram-negative pathogenic bacterium, which is associated with a number of human diseases, including gastritis, peptic ulceration, and gastric cancer [18] . It is reported that H. pylori has chronically infected about 50% of the world\u2019s population, and such an infection is a severe threat to human health. Therefore, the discovery of novel drugs against this pathogenic bacterium has been an attractive project. In this study, we report the cloning and stability characterization as well as the structural modeling of FabZ from H. pylori SS1 strain (HpFabZ). The Hp fab Z gene sequence has been deposited in the GenBank database (Accession No. AY725427 ). It is hoped that our present study might supply some important information for HpFabZ investigation and provides possible hints in the discovery of anti-bacterial compounds targeting this enzyme. Materials and methods Materials. Helicobacter pylori strain SS1 was obtained from our institute. Escherichia coli host strain M15 was purchased from Qiagen. All chemicals were of reagent grade or ultrapure quality and commercially available. Cloning of H. pylori fabZ gene (HpfabZ). On the basis of genome sequences of H. pylori strains 26695 and J99 (GenBank Accession Nos. NC_000915 and NC_000921 ), two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers (forward: 5\u2032-ACGCAAAATTCCCCAATCTCTCTAC-3\u2032 and reverse: 5\u2032-GCGGTTTTCTTATGGTATAATAGCG-3\u2032) were designed to amplify the corresponding region containing fab Z gene from the chromosome of H. pylori strain SS1. The genomic DNA of H. pylori strain SS1 as a template was prepared by using Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Sangon). The reaction was performed for 30 cycles: 45 s at 94 \u00b0C, 45 s at 53 \u00b0C, and 1.5 min at 72 \u00b0C. The amplified DNA segment was purified and subjected to nucleotide sequencing. According to the sequencing result, a pair of PCR primers (sense: 5\u2032-TTT GGATCC ATGGAACAAAGCCATCAA-3\u2032, and antisense: 5\u2032-GGGG AAGCTT TTATTCTCTCTCTGCGAT-3\u2032) was synthesized to clone the fab Z gene from H. pylori strain SS1. The following protocol was conducted for amplification: 30 s at 94 \u00b0C, 30 s at 50 \u00b0C, and 1 min at 72 \u00b0C, 30 cycles. The PCR products were digested with restriction endonuclease Bam HI (Fermentas) and Hin dIII (Fermentas), and cloned into a prokaryotic expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen) to produce the recombinant plasmid pQE30-Hp fab Z that contains an N-terminal six-histidine tag for purification purpose. After the recombinant clone pQE30-Hp fab Z was sequenced, the nucleotide sequence of fab Z gene from H. pylori strain SS1 was submitted to GenBank database under the Accession No. AY725427 . Expression and purification of HpFabZ. pQE30-Hp fab Z was transformed into E. coli strain M15 growing in LB media supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/mL of ampicillin and 50 \u03bcg/mL of kanamycin at 37 \u00b0C. When OD 600 reached 1.0, the culture was induced by 0.4 mM isopropyl-\u03b2- d -thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for an additional 6 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C and suspended in buffer A (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, and 5 mM imidazole). After sonication treatment on ice, the mixture yielded a clear supernatant by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 45 min at 4 \u00b0C, which was loaded onto a column with Ni\u2013NTA resin (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed with buffer B (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, and 40 mM imidazole) for several times and eluted with buffer C (20 mM, Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, and 500 mM imidazole). The soluble fractions were then collected and dialyzed against buffer D (20 mM, Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.0, and 500 mM NaCl) to remove imidazole. The proper concentration of HpFabZ was obtained by ultrafiltration using Amicon centrifugal device. The concentration of HpFabZ was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm with the extinction coefficient of 16,960 L/mol/cm. Enzymatic characterization. The enzymatic activity of HpFabZ was determined by using crotonoyl-CoA as substrate [14] . The enzymatic reaction system in a total volume of 150 \u03bcL involved 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 2 \u03bcg HpFabZ, and 100 \u03bcM crotonoyl-CoA. The reaction was thereby assayed by detecting the decrease in absorbance at 260 nm. The experiments were performed on a HITACHI U-2010 spectrophotometer at 25 \u00b0C. The kinetic parameters such as K m , k cat , and k cat / K m of the substrate were determined according to the published method [14] . The temperature-dependent enzymatic activity was determined from 20 to 90 \u00b0C. Mass spectral investigation. The LC/MS system for analyzing the mass spectra of HpFabZ sample was a combination of HP1100 (Agilent) LC system with LCQ-DECA mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan). A microbore reverse phase column (C8 50 \u00d7 1.0 mm ID,7 \u03bcm, ABI RP300) was used for LC separation. Solvent A was 0.1% FA in 100% (v/v) water, and solvent B was 0.1% FA in 100% (v/v) CH 3 CN. The gradient started at 5% B, held for 2 min, and went linearly to 80% B in 40 min. The purified HpFabZ (1.5 mg/mL) was injected to the column by an autosampler and separated at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The peptide fraction was detected by PDA (TSP UV2000) and directly introduced online into ESI source. The operating condition was optimized with standard solution, and the working parameters of ion source were as follows: capillary temperature, 200 \u00b0C; spray voltage, 5 kV; capillary voltage, 15 V; and sheath gas flow rate, 20 arb. The scan mass range was from m / z 200 to 2000. Dynamic light scattering and native-PAGE analysis. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) investigation of HpFabZ sample (2.0 mg/mL, 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.0, and 500 mM NaCl) was performed on a DYNAPRO instrument. The data collection time was 10 s at 25 \u00b0C, and the Dynamics V 6 software was used for detecting the molecular mass of HpFabZ in solution. To investigate the molecular mass of HpFabZ in the native state, native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (native-PAGE) was performed in 5% stacking gel and 8% separating gel. The purified protein sample was electrophoresed at 100 V for 5 h after initial electrophoresis at 70 V for 30 min. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 and then destained. The molecular mass of HpFabZ was further estimated according to the high molecular weight standards (Amersham Biosciences). Circular dichroism spectral investigations. All the circular dichroism (CD) spectral investigations against HpFabZ were carried out using a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter at 25 \u00b0C under constant nitrogen flow. The HpFabZ concentration was 0.3 mg/mL for far-UV (190\u2013250 nm) assay using 1 mm cell and 1.0 mg/mL for near-UV (250\u2013320 nm) determination using 1 cm cell. To determine the temperature-dependent spectra, HpFabZ was incubated for 10 min at the corresponding temperature prior to assay. Experimental data were corrected by subtracting the blank obtained under the same conditions in the absence of protein sample. 3D structural model construction. To drive the structural analyses of HpFabZ, the 3D structure of HpFabZ was constructed by the homology modeling based on the available structure of the homologous protein PaFabZ. The X-ray crystal structure of PaFabZ (PDB entry 1U1Z) [17] was obtained from the Protein Data Bank [19] . Sequence analysis and conserved residues identification were carried out between PaFabZ and HpFabZ, and the PaFabZ sequence was obtained from the Swiss_Prot/TrEMBL database ( http://www.expasy.ch/prosite ). HpFabZ structural model was generated using the Homology module of the Insight II software package [20] . The pairwise sequence alignment between the target HpFabZ and the template PaFabZ was performed against each of the homology sequence. Gaps were inserted into the sequences to find an optimal alignment with a length-independent gap penalty of 6. The final sequence alignment of HpFabZ with PaFabZ is shown in Fig. 7 . Regions of the structural similarity were automatically selected and employed to build a framework for the model structure. Wherever the two aligned residues are the same, the template side-chain geometry is adopted in the target. Otherwise, the template side chain is replaced by the corresponding target residue by aligning the C\u03b1\u2013C\u03b2 bonds. Gap regions were generated by searching for a suitable fragment from Protein Data Bank screening and the in-house database [21] . The final loop conformation was chosen from one of the top 10 structures containing the lowest root mean square (RMS) values with compatible geometries between the target and a suitable fragment. Some missing atoms were also added to the incomplete side chains of this model using the Biopolymer module in Sybyl software package [22] to ensure the proper assignment of hydrogens and atomic charge. After the initial HpFabZ monomer model was built, its hexamer was constructed by superimposing the modeled HpFabZ monomer with each monomer of the X-ray crystal structure of the PaFabZ hexamer. The preliminary HpFabZ hexamer model was then subject to evaluation by PROCHECK [23] and Profiles-3D [24] to examine the stereochemical quality and the protein structure of the models. In the model evaluation by Profiles-3D, a self-compatibility score (S) was determined for each residue in the sequence. The resulting structure was optimized by energy minimization using the Amber force field implemented in the Sybyl software package [22] . The backbone atoms of all residues were first fixed during the initial stages of refinement to prevent the backbone from deforming significantly. Then, the number of constraints applied to the model was reduced during subsequent cycles. For minimization, the following parameters were used: Kollman-all-atom force field and all-atom charge, distant-dependent dielectric constant of 4.0R, 9.5 \u00c5 cut-off for nonbonded calculations, and conjugate gradient minimization until the RMS gradient in the energy was <0.05 kcal/mol \u00c5. Results and discussion Cloning, expression, and sequence analysis of HpfabZ gene In this study, the fab Z gene from H. pylori strain SS1 (Hp fab Z) was successfully cloned based on the available genome sequences of H. pylori strains 26695 and J99, and the recombinant expression plasmid pQE30-Hp fab Z was generated by inserting the amplified fab Z fragment into the vector pQE30. The Hp fab Z gene was a 480 bp fragment including the stop codon. Fig. 1 shows the sequence alignment of HpFabZ with other FabZs from several other model organisms by Clustal W ( www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw ). It is found that HpFabZ shared 42% identity with EcFabZ (FabZ of E. coli ). Even for AtFabZ (FabZ of Arabidopsis thaliana ) that is from a kind of plant, it shares above 30% identity with HpFabZ. This result thereby indicates that fab Z gene is quite conserved. In addition, the polygenetic analysis also suggested that HpFabZ and PaFabZ (FabZ of P. aeruginosa ) belong to the same subfamily as indicated in Fig. 2 . HpFabZ could be successfully expressed in E. coli system and purified by a one-step purification protocol judged from SDS\u2013PAGE and native-PAGE ( Fig. 3 ). The LC/MS spectral data shown in Fig. 3 C gave a 19,581 Da molecular mass of HpFabZ, which is in good agreement with the 19,583 Da molecular mass from its amino acid sequence analysis. The purified HpFabZ on SDS\u2013PAGE yielded its monomeric molecular weight around 20 kDa according to the marker, consistent with the LC/MS result. However, the native-PAGE in Fig. 3 B suggests that the native HpFabZ has the molecular weight around 120 kDa. DLS result ( Fig. 3 D) shows that the radius of native HpFabZ in solution was estimated to be 4.1 nm, thereby implying that HpFabZ might exist as a hexamer in its native state. Such a result is compatible with the hexamer form for PaFabZ of P. aeruginosa [17] , and different from the dimer case for PfFabZ from P. falciparum [14] . Enzymatic characterization In this study, crotonoyl-CoA was used for characterizing the enzymatic activity of HpFabZ. The conversion of crotonoyl-CoA to \u03b2-hydroxybutyryl-CoA was detected by the decrease in absorbance at 260 nm [14] . The results showed that the purified HpFabZ was active with K m at 82.6 \u00b1 4.3 \u03bcM, k cat at 0.013 s \u22121 , and k cat / K m at 157 m \u22121 s \u22121 ( Fig. 4 ), similar to the reported results for PfFabZ enzyme [14] . Fig. 5 shows the temperature influences on the HpFabZ enzyme activity. It was found that HpFabZ shows its highest enzymatic activity at 40 \u00b0C. To our surprise, HpFabZ still exhibited almost 50% activity even at 90 \u00b0C. These results thus suggest that HpFabZ shows highly enzymatic stability, which is probably relevant to its strikingly compacted hexameric structure as discussed in the related parts of this study. Thermal-induced unfolding analysis To inspect the thermal stability of HpFabZ, the thermal-induced unfolding investigation of HpFabZ was performed by employing CD spectral analysis. As shown in the far-UV CD spectra ( Fig. 6 A), HpFabZ still exhibits distinctly negative peak at 218 nm even at 90 \u00b0C, demonstrating that its secondary structure might not fully destroyed by high temperature (even at 90 \u00b0C). The near-UV CD is usually used as a useful approach to probe the tertiary structure changes during protein unfolding process. As indicated in Fig. 6 B, the near-UV CD spectra of HpFabZ in its native state exhibited a negative ellipticity around 295 nm, which did not completely disappear even though the temperature increased to 90 \u00b0C. However, this negative band generally almost completely disappears in the fully unfolding state of protein in the near-UV region [25,26] . Therefore, our result implied that the tertiary structure of HpFabZ was not fully destroyed at high temperature. Such a highly structural stability for HpFabZ as mentioned above could be tentatively ascribed to its hexamer state. As discussed in the modeled HpFabZ structure, when HpFabZ suffers high temperature, the decrease of the H-bonds formed in the structure could be compensated by the increase of the strength of the hydrophobic interactions, which is supposed to play a key role in the formation and maintenance of the HpFabZ hexamer structure. 3D structural characterization Sequence alignment result indicates that HpFabZ (residues 13\u2013159) has 46.9% sequence identity with PaFabZ, and another 30% residues were conservative substitutions, thus giving an overall sequence similarity of 78.91% for HpFabZ to PaFabZ ( Fig. 7 ). The HpFabZ hexamer model was then evaluated using Ramachandran plots derived by the PROCHECK program [23] . The Ramachandran plot analyzes the backbone phi ( \u03d5 ) and psi ( \u03c8 ) torsional angles of a protein and calculates the percentage occupancies for \u201cfavored,\u201d \u201callowed,\u201d \u201cgenerously allowed,\u201d and \u201cdisallowed\u201d regions as a quality measurement of a protein structure. Altogether, 99.2% of the residues were in favored and allowed regions for the model. In addition to the evaluation of stereochemical quality for the models, we also performed Profiles-3D [24] analysis to further evaluate the models by checking the quality of side-chain packing. The overall quality score for HpFabZ was 373.80/404.82, where the denominator denotes the expected score for a protein of this length based on known structures. For comparison, scores of 182.17/404.82 or less would suggest the structure is almost certainly incorrect. After successful validation, the quality of HpFabZ hexamer structure appeared to be acceptable for further study. The ribbon diagrams of the modeled HpFabZ monomer and hexamer structures are shown in Fig. 8 . In these models, similar to PaFabZ [17] , five key motifs (PHRYPFLLVD, GHFP, PGVL, EALAQ, and PGD) are also conserved. From the analysis of the H-bonds among monomers, a few key interactions mediated by H-bonds were detected as indicated in Table 1A of Supplementary material , where the crucial H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions between Pro22, His23, Arg24 and Gly57, His58, Phe59, Pro60 are retained. Moreover, similar strong hydrophobic and H-bonds interactions are found in the monomer hydrophobic interface between Leu28, Leu29, Val30, Arg31 and Pro115, Gly116, Asp117. As a result of the strong hydrophobic interactions in the HpFabZ hexamer, the enzyme is stable and active even at a very high temperature (90 \u00b0C). This demonstrated that these conserved motifs might play an important role in the enzyme structure stabilization for HpFabZ hexamer. The HpFabZ monomer involves six-stranded anti-parallel \u03b2-sheets and three \u03b1-helixes ( Fig. 8 A), and the secondary structure percentage of \u03b1-helix, \u03b2-strand, and coil were 15.6%, 62.5%, and 21.7%, respectively. Such a \u03b2-strand predominant fact is in good agreement with the CD spectral result. The CD spectra at 25 \u00b0C for HpFabZ showed a significant negative ellipticity at 218 nm ( Fig. 6 A), which indicates that the \u03b2-sheets are predominant in the secondary structure of HpFabZ. Like PaFabA and PaFabZ, the active site of HpFabZ is located in the dimer interface with the crucial residues (His58 and Glu73 in HpFabZ, and His49 and Glu63 in PaFabZ) and those of other monomers. As shown in Fig. 8 B, the HpFabZ hexamer is formed as an open-channel structure. Similar to PaFabZ [17] , the substrate-binding tunnel for HpFabZ is long, narrow, and hydrophobic, which involves the monomers, and the catalytic residues (His58 and Glu73) are situated in the half-length of the tunnel. In structure, HpFabZ has several conserved motifs, which are not only related to the catalytic activity, but also to the structural stability of its hexamer. It is the hexamer formation that makes HpFabZ a rather stable enzyme resistant to high temperature or extreme pH value conditions. In conclusion, in this study, the molecular cloning and enzymatic characterization as well as the stability of HpFabZ were fully addressed. Sequence alignment results showed that fab Z belongs to a quite conserved gene family. HpFabZ forms as a hexamer in the native state as judged by native-PAGE and DLS analysis. The thermal-induced unfolding analysis clearly indicated that HpFabZ hexamer was considerably stable as compared to most of the other multimeric proteins. Such a high stability could be ascribed to the strongly hydrophobic interactions and high H-bonds among the hexamers as investigated by its structural modeling. Since FabZ is a potent enzyme in bacterial FAS and catalyzes the dehydration of \u03b2-hydroxyacyl-ACP to trans -2-acyl-ACP for bacteria, it has been studied as an important target for anti-bacterial drug design. Therefore, our present study might hopefully supply useful information in better understanding the FabZ features of H. pylori strain and further providing possible hints in the discovery of the anti-bacterial compounds using HpFabZ as target.

In this work, three series of derivatives (compounds 3, 4, and 5) were designed, synthesized, and their biological activities were investigated as potential HpFabZ inhibitors in a two phased manner. First, we designed and synthesized two series of derivatives (3a-r and 4a-u) and evaluated the enzyme-based assay against HpFabZ. Five compounds (3i-k, 3m, and 3q) showed potential inhibitory activity, with IC50 values less than 2 \u03bcM. Second, a focused combinatorial library containing 280 molecules was designed employing the LD1.0 program. Twelve compounds (5a-l) were selected and synthesized. The activity of the most potent compound 5h (IC 50) 0.86 \u03bcM) was 46 times higher than that of the hit 1. The high hit rate and the potency of the new HpFabZ inhibitors demonstrated the efficiency of the strategy for the focused library design and virtual screening. \u00a9 2009 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus is a novel human coronavirus and is responsible for SARS infection. SARS coronavirus 3C-like proteinase (SARS 3CL(pro)) plays key roles in viral replication and transcription and is an attractive target for anti-SARS drug discovery. In this report, we quantitatively characterized the dimerization features of the full-length and N-terminal residues 1-7 deleted SARS 3CL(pro)s by using glutaraldehyde cross-linking SDS-PAGE, size-exclusion chromatography, and isothermal titration calorimeter techniques. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking SDS-PAGE and size-exclusion chromatography results show that, similar to the full-length SARS 3CL(pro), the N-terminal deleted SARS 3CL(pro) still remains a dimer/monomer mixture within a wide range of protein concentrations. Isothermal titration calorimeter determinations indicate that the equilibrium dissociation constant (K(d)) of the N-terminal deleted proteinase dimer (262 microm) is very similar to that of the full-length proteinase dimer (227 microm). Enzymatic activity assay using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer method reveals that N-terminal deletion results in almost complete loss of enzymatic activity for SARS 3CL(pro). Molecular dynamics and docking simulations demonstrate the N-terminal deleted proteinase dimer adopts a state different from that of the full-length proteinase dimer, which increases the angle between the two protomers and reduces the binding pocket that is not beneficial to the substrate binding. This conclusion is verified by the surface plasmon resonance biosensor determination, indicating that the model substrate cannot bind to the N-terminal deleted proteinase. These results suggest the N terminus is not indispensable for the proteinase dimerization but may fix the dimer at the active state and is therefore vital to enzymatic activity.",

The trajectories were analyzed by using principal component analysis.Trajectory analyses showed that upon binding the ligand, the flexibility of the entire PTP1B molecule decreases. The most notable change is the movement of the WPD-loop. Our simulation results also indicated that electrostatic interactions contribute more to PTP1B-SNA complex conformation than the van der Waals interactions, and that Lys41, Arg47, and Asp48 play important roles in determining the conformation of the inhibitor SNA and in the potency and selectivity of the inhibitor. Of these, Arg47 contributed most. These results were in agreement with previous experimental results.The information presented here suggests that potent and selective PTP1B inhibitors can be designed by targeting the surface residues, for example the region containing Lys41, Arg47, and Asp48, instead of the second phosphate binding site (besides the active phosphate binding site).",

        "abstract": "Spike glycoprotein of SARS coronavirus (S protein) plays a pivotal role in SARS coronavirus (SARS_CoV) infection. The immunological fragment of the S protein (Ala251-His641, SARS_S1b) is believed to be essential for SARS_CoV entering the host cell through S protein-ACE-2 interaction. We have quantitatively characterized the thermally induced and GuHCl-induced unfolding features of SARS_S1b using circular dichroism (CD), tryptophan fluorescence, and stopped-flow spectral techniques. For the thermally induced unfolding at pH 7.4, the apparent activation energy (E(app)) and transition midpoint temperature (Tm) were determined to be 16.3 +/- 0.2 kcal/mol and 52.5 +/- 0.4 degrees C, respectively. The CD spectra are not dependent on temperature, suggesting that the secondary structure of SARS_S1b has a relatively high thermal stability. GuHCl strongly affected SARS_S1b structure. Both the CD and fluorescent spectra resulted in consistent values of the transition middle concentration of the denaturant (Cm, ranging from 2.30 to 2.45 M) and the standard free energy change (deltaG(o), ranging from 2.1 to 2.5 kcal/mol) for the SARS_S1b unfolding reaction. Moreover, the kinetic features of the chemical unfolding and refolding of SARS_S1b were also characterized using a stopped-flow CD spectral technique. The obvious unfolding reaction rates and relaxation times were determined at various GuHCl concentrations, and the Cm value was obtained, which is very close to the data that resulted from CD and fluorescent spectral determinations. Secondary and three-dimensional structural predictions by homology modeling indicated that SARS_S1b folded as a globular-like structure by beta-sheets and loops; two of the four tryptophans are located on the protein surface, which is in agreement with the tryptophan fluorescence result. The three-dimensional model was also used to explain the recently published experimental results of S1-ACE-2 binding and immunizations.",

        "abstract": "Retinoic X receptor (RXR) is a promising target for drug discovery against cancer and metabolic syndromes. Here, we identified a specific RXR\u03b1 antagonist, danthron, from the traditional Chinese medicine rhubarb. Danthron repressed all tested RXR\u03b1-involved response element transcription, including the RXRE, PPRE, FXRE, and LXRE. Results from native PAGE and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)-based assays indicated that danthron bound to the tetrameric RXR\u03b1-LBD in a specific stoichimetric ratio, and such a binding could influence the corepressor SMRT affinity to the receptor. Additionally, a unique tetrameric structure of the apo-RXR\u03b1 ligand-binding domain (LBD) was determined, which exhibited a larger tetramer interface and different ligand-binding pocket size compared with the one previously reported. Together with the biochemical and biophysical results, the determined crystal structure of danthron-soaked RXR\u03b1-LBD suggested a new mechanism for danthron antagonism to tetrameric RXR\u03b1. Moreover, the in vivo efficient improvement of insulin sensitivity by danthron was observed in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Thus, our findings were expected to supply new insights into the structural basis of RXR\u03b1 antagonist for its further potential therapeutic application.",

        "abstract": "Liver X receptor (LXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) are two members of nuclear receptors involved in the nutrient metabolisms of dietary fatty acid and cholesterol. They are found to be of cross-talk function in that LXR regulates fatty acid synthesis and PPAR controls fatty acid degradation. LXRs (LXRalpha and LXRbeta) function by forming obligate heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), and subsequently binding to specific DNA response elements within the regulatory regions of their target genes. In this work, the kinetic features concerning LXR/RXR and LXR/PPAR interactions have been fully investigated using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology. It is found that LXRs could bind to all the three PPAR subtypes, PPARalpha, PPARgamma and PPARdelta with different binding affinities, and such receptor/receptor interactions could be regulated by ligand binding. Moreover, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on six typical complex models. The results revealed that ligands may increase the interaction energies between the receptor interfaces of the simulated receptor/receptor complexes. The MD results are in agreement with the SPR data. Further analyses on the MD results indicated that the ligand binding might increase the hydrogen bonds between the interfaces of the receptor/receptor complex.",

        "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is a therapeutic target for obesity, cancer and diabetes mellitus. In order to develop potent lead compounds for obesity treatment, we screened a natural product library for novel PPARgamma antagonists with inhibitory effects on adipocyte differentiation.Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology and cell-based transactivation assay were used to screen for PPARgamma antagonists. To investigate the antagonistic mechanism of the active compound, we measured its effect on PPARgamma/RXRalpha heterodimerization and PPARgamma co-activator recruitment using yeast two-hybrid assay, Gal4/UAS cell-based assay and SPR based assay. The 3T3-L1 cell differentiation assay was used to evaluate the effect of the active compound on adipocyte differentiation.A new thiophene-acetylene type of natural product, 7-chloroarctinone-b (CAB), isolated from the roots of Rhaponticum uniflorum, was discovered as a novel PPARgamma antagonist capable of inhibiting rosiglitazone-induced PPARgamma transcriptional activity. SPR analysis suggested that CAB bound tightly to PPARgamma and considerably antagonized the potent PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone-stimulated PPARgamma-LBD/RXRalpha-LBD binding. Gal4/UAS and yeast two-hybrid assays were used to evaluate the antagonistic activity of CAB on rosiglitazone-induced recruitment of the coactivator for PPARgamma. CAB could efficiently antagonize both hormone and rosiglitazone-induced adipocyte differentiation in cell culture.CAB shows antagonistic activity to PPARgamma and can block the adipocyte differentiation, indicating it may be of potential use as a lead therapeutic compound for obesity.",

        "abstract": "Glucokinase (GK) is an important enzyme for regulating blood glucose levels and a potentially attractive target for diabetes of the young type 2 and persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy. To characterize the conformational transition of GK from the closed state to the superopen state, a series of conventional molecular dynamics (MD) and target MD (TMD) simulations were performed on both the wild-type enzyme and its mutants. Two 10-ns conventional MD simulations showed that, although the allosteric site of GK is approximately 20 A away from the active site, the activator is able to enhance the activity of the enzyme through conformational restriction. Fourteen TMD simulations on GK and five of its mutants revealed a reliably conformational transition pathway. The overall conformational transition includes three stages, and three likely stable intermediate states were identified by free energy scanning for the snapshots throughout the pathway. The conformational transition feature revealed by our TMD simulations rationalized several important mutagenesis and kinetic data. Remarkably, the TMD simulations predicted that Y61S, I159A, A201R, V203E, and V452S mutations, which have not been investigated so far, may facilitate the opening process of GK. These predictions also have been verified by mutagenesis and kinetic analyses in this study. These observations are beneficial to understanding the mechanism of GK regulation and designing the compounds for treating metabolic diseases.",

We discovered a quinazoline-2(1H)-thione derivative (DCBL55) as a new Bcl-x L, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 inhibitor by virtual database screening. We systematically modified the structure of compound 1 by chemical synthesis. The interactions of the compounds with Bcl-xL were predicted by molecular modeling simulations, which were confirmed by Structure-activity relationship analysis and protein mutation studies. Three locations at the hydrophobic groove of Bcl-xL, referred to as P2, P4, and P5, were found to contribute to the ligand interactions. Although the compounds induced mitochondrial potential reduction, caspase activation, and ROS generation, the cytotoxicities and the ultrastructural changes of outer mitochondrial membrane suggested that the compounds may target additional proteins outside the Bcl-2 family. Altogether, the present study provides new lead compounds and critical structural information for further development of more potent and specific inhibitors of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. \u00a9 2010 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Flavonoids are the major functional components of many herbal and insect preparations and demonstrate varied pharmacological functions including antibacterial activity. Here by enzymatic assay and crystal structure analysis, we studied the inhibition of three flavonoids (quercetin, apigenin, and (S)-sakuranetin) against the \u03b2-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein dehydratase from Helicobacter pylori (HpFabZ). These three flavonoids are all competitive inhibitors against HpFabZ by either binding to the entrance of substrate tunnel B (binding model A) or plugging into the tunnel C near the catalytic residues (binding model B) mainly by hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen-bond pattern. Surrounded by hydrophobic residues of HpFabZ at both positions of models A and B, the methoxy group at C-7 of (S)-sakuranetin seems to play an important role for the inhibitor's binding to HpFabZ, partly responsible for the higher inhibitory activity of (S)-sakuranetin than those of quercetin and apigenin against HpFabZ (IC50 in \u03bcM: (S)-sakuranetin, 2.0 \u00b1 0.1; quercetin: 39.3 \u00b1 2.7; apigenin, 11.0 \u00b1 2.5). Our work is expected to supply useful information for understanding the potential antibacterial mechanism of flavonoids. Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Protein Society.",

        "abstract": "The New Delhi Metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (NDM-1) was first reported in 2009 in a Swedish patient. A recent study reported that Klebsiella pneumonia NDM-1 positive strain or Escherichia coli NDM-1 positive strain was highly resistant to all antibiotics tested except tigecycline and colistin. These can no longer be relied on to treat infections and therefore, NDM-1 now becomes potentially a major global health threat.In this study, we performed modeling studies to obtain its 3D structure and NDM-1/antibiotics complex. It revealed that the hydrolytic mechanisms are highly conserved. In addition, the detailed analysis indicates that the more flexible and hydrophobic loop1, together with the evolution of more positive-charged loop2 leads to NDM-1 positive strain more potent and extensive in antibiotics resistance compared with other MBLs. Furthermore, through biological experiments, we revealed the molecular basis for antibiotics catalysis of NDM-1 on the enzymatic level. We found that NDM-1 enzyme was highly potent to degrade carbapenem antibiotics, while mostly susceptible to tigecycline, which had the ability to slow down the hydrolysis velocity of meropenem by NDM-1. Meanwhile, the mutagenesis experiments, including D124A, C208A, K211A and K211E, which displayed down-regulation on meropenem catalysis, proved the accuracy of our model.At present, there are no effective antibiotics against NDM-1 positive pathogen. Our study will provide clues to investigate the molecular basis of extended antibiotics resistance of NDM-1 and then accelerate the search for new antibiotics against NDM-1 positive strain in clinical studies.",

Further investigation demonstrated that compound A6 can significantly reduce A\u03b2 production and increase A\u03b2 clearance, and alleviate Tau hyperphosphorylation. Most importantly, compound A6 could ameliorate learning and memory impairments in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. The present study evidently showed that compound A6 is a potent neuroprotective agent and might serve as a promising lead candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

Cell viability was determined using MTT assay. Real-time PCR was performed to measure the gene expression. Western blotting assay was applied to investigate the protein phosphorylation level. Enzymatic assay kits were used to detect the total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and glucose contents.Danthron (0.1, 1, and 10 \u03bcmol/L) dose-dependently promoted the phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in both HepG2 and C2C12 cells. Meanwhile, danthron treatment significantly reduced the lipid synthesis related sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and fatty acid synthetase (FAS) gene expressions, and the TC and TG levels. In addition, danthron treatment efficiently increased glucose consumption. The actions of danthron on lipid and glucose metabolism were abolished or reversed by co-treatment with the AMPK inhibitor compound C.Danthron effectively reduces intracellular lipid contents and enhanced glucose consumption in vitro via activation of AMPK signaling pathway.",

The potential binding sites were predicted by molecular modeling and determined by site-directed mutagenesis and a SPR binding assay.1-pyrrolidineacetamide, N,N'-(methylene-di-4,1-phenylene) bis-1-pyrrolidineacetamide could competitively inhibit IN binding to viral DNA with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) value of 7.29+/-0.68 micromol/L as investigated by SPR-based investigation. Another antiretroviral activity assay showed that this compound exhibited inhibition against HIV-1(IIIB) replication with a 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) value of 40.54 micromol/L in C8166 cells, and cytotoxicity with a cytotoxic concentration value of 173.84 micromol/L in mock-infected C8166 cells. Molecular docking predicted 3 potential residues as 1-pyrrolidineacetamide, N,N'-(methylene-di-4,1-phenylene)bis-1- pyrrolidineacetamide binding sites. The importance of 3 key amino acid residues (Lys103, Lys173, and Thr174) involved in the binding was further identified by site-directed mutagenesis and a SPR binding assay.This present work identified a new anti-HIV compound through a new IN-binding site which is expected to supply new potential drug-binding site information for HIV-1 integrase inhibitor discovery and development.",

        "abstract": "The sesquiterpene hydroquinones/quinones belong to one class of marine sponge metabolites, and they have received considerable attention due to their varied biological activities, including anti-tumor, anti-HIV, and anti-inflammatory action. In order to probe the potential anti-diabetic effect of the sesquiterpene hydroquinones/quinones, the effect of dysidine on the insulin pathway was studied.The promotion of glucose uptake by dysidine was studied in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. The increase in membrane-located GLUT4 by dysidine was studied in CHO-K1/GLUT4 and 3T3-L1 cells by immuno-staining. The activation of the insulin signaling pathway by dysidine was probed by Western blotting. The inhibition of PTPases by dysidine was detected in vitro.Dysidine, found in the Hainan sponge Dysidea villosa in the Chinese South Sea, effectively activated the insulin signaling pathway, greatly promoted glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 cells, and showed strong insulin-sensitizing activities. The potential targets of action for dysidine were probed, and the results indicated that dysidine exhibited its cellular effects through activation of the insulin pathway, possibly through the inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases, with more specific inhibition against protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B).Our findings are expected to expand understanding of the biological activities of sesquiterpene hydroquinones/quinones, and they show that dysidine could be a potential lead compound in the development of an alternative adjuvant in insulin therapy.",

        "abstract": "Smad2 is an important factor in TGFbeta/Smad2 signal transduction pathway with ability for signal propagation, it could translocate from cytoplasm to nucleus after the TGFbeta receptor-mediated phosphorylation. 15-deoxy-delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), a natural agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), is found recently to be able to function in the regulation of Smad2 activity. However, no quantification data have been yet reported, and it still keeps suspenseful whether or not 15d-PGJ2 could regulate Smad2 activity by depending on PPARgamma through PPAR gamma/TGFbeta/ Smad2 pathway. In this work, by analyzing the EGFP-Smad2 location in CHO cells according to the Nucleus Trafficking Analysis Module based on IN Cell Analyzer 1000 platform, TGFbeta stimulated EGFP-Smad2 translocation regulated by 15d-PGJ2 was quantitatively investigated. The results showed that TGFbeta could induce EGFP-Smad2 translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus by EC50 of 8.83 pM, and 15d-PGJ2 could impede the TGFbeta-stimulated Smad2 translocation by IC50 of 0.68 microM. Moreover, GW9662, a PPARgamma antagonist, could attenuate such a 15d-PGJ2 inhibitory activity by almost one order of magnitude. This result thereby implies that 15d-PGJ2 might inhibit Smad2 translocation through PPARgamma/TGFbeta/Smad2 pathway. Further investigation discovered that different from the case for 15d-PGJ2, rosiglitazone, another PPARgamma agonist, could enhance Smad2 translocation to nucleus, suggesting that rosiglitazone and 15d-PGJ(2) might take different modes in the activation of PPARgamma within the signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "The war on cancer is progressing globally but slowly as researchers around the world continue to seek and discover more innovative and effective ways of curing this catastrophic disease. Organizing biological information, representing it, and making it accessible, or biocuration, is an important aspect of biomedical research and discovery. However, because maintaining sophisticated biocuration is highly resource dependent, it continues to lag behind the continually being generated biomedical data. Another critical aspect of cancer research, pathway analysis, has proven to be an efficient method for gaining insight into the underlying biology associated with cancer. We propose a deep-learning-based model, Stacked Denoising Autoencoder Multi-Label Learning (SdaMLL), for facilitating gene multi-function discovery and pathway completion. SdaMLL can capture intermediate representations robust to partial corruption of the input pattern and generate low-dimensional codes superior to conditional dimension reduction tools. Experimental results indicate that SdaMLL outperforms existing classical multi-label algorithms. Moreover, we found some gene functions, such as Fused in Sarcoma (FUS, which may be part of transcriptional misregulation in cancer) and p27 (which we expect will become a member viral carcinogenesis), that can be used to complete the related pathways. We provide a visual tool ( https://www.keaml.cn/gpvisual ) to view the new gene functions in cancer pathways.",

        "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) belong to the members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, and play important roles in lipid and glucose homeostasis. Residue Phe282 in PPARgamma (Phe273 in PPARalpha), beyond the ligand-binding site, is a conserved amino acid across several nuclear receptors and in all PPAR subfamily. In this work, we firstly investigated the influence of Phe282(273)Ala mutation on the binding affinity of PPARgamma(alpha) against a series of agonists by use of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique and cellular transcriptional activation analysis. Phe282(273)Ala mutation decreases the binding affinities of the ligands to the receptors in certain degrees, from several to 1000-folds. Phe282Ala mutation dramatically reduced the binding affinity of PPARgamma to GI262570, however, this mutation did not affect PPARalpha binding to this ligand, thereby suggesting that the Phe282 and Phe273 are associated with the selectivity of GI262570 binding to PPARgamma and PPARalpha. The mutation reduced the transcriptional activation activities of the receptors induced by the ligand binding, and the decrease degree is generally in agreement with the binding affinities of the ligands to the receptors. The 5 ns MD simulations for the wild-type and mutated PPARgamma showed that the mutation did not influence the flexibility of the receptor. There is no repulsion between Phe282 and the proceeding loop of AF2. However, substitution of Phe282 by alanine enlarged the entrance of the binding pocket and abolished the repulsive interaction between solvent water molecules and this hydrophobic residue, thus more water molecules can enter into the binding pocket. It needs more energy to exclude the extra water molecules for a ligand binding to the mutated receptor. In addition, the extra water molecules abolish some of H-bonds between the ligand and receptors. Therefore, solvent effect may be concluded as the major source of the decrease of binding affinity for the mutated receptors to the ligands, and thereby of the decrease of their transcriptional activation activities.",

        "abstract": "The nuclear receptor retinoid X receptor (RXR) functions potently in the regulation of homeostasis and cell development, while rexinoids as RXR agonists have proved their therapeutic potential in the treatment of metabolic diseases and cancer. Here, the natural product bigelovin was identified as a selective RXR\u03b1 agonist. Interestingly, this compound could not transactivate RXR\u03b1:RXR\u03b1 homodimer but could enhance the transactivation of RXR\u03b1:peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 heterodimer and repress that of RXR\u03b1:liver X receptor (LXR) \u03b1 heterodimer, while it had no effects on RXR\u03b1:farnesoid X receptor heterodimer. Considering that the effective role of LXR response element involved transactivation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c mediated by RXR\u03b1:LXR\u03b1 in triglyceride elevation, such LXR response element repressing by bigelovin has obviously addressed its potency for further research. Moreover, our determined crystal structure of the bigelovin-activated RXR\u03b1 ligand-binding domain with the coactivator human steroid receptor coactivator-1 peptide revealed that bigelovin adopted a distinct binding mode. Compared with the known RXR ligands, bigelovin lacks the acidic moiety in structure, which indicated that the acidic moiety rendered little effects on RXR activation. Our results have thereby provided new insights into the structure-based selective rexinoids design with bigelovin as a potential lead compound.",

        "abstract": "This study applied an efficient virtual screening strategy integrating molecular docking with MM-GBSA rescoring to identify diverse human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (hDHODH) inhibitors. Eighteen compounds with IC(50) values ranging from 0.11 to 18.8 \u03bcM were identified as novel hDHODH inhibitors that exhibited overall species-selectivity over Plasmodium falciparum dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (pfDHODH). Compound 8, the most potent one, showed low micromolar inhibitory activity against hDHODH with an IC(50) value of 0.11 \u03bcM. Moreover, lipopolysaccharide-induced B-cell assay and mixed lymphocyte reaction assay revealed that most of the hits showed potent antiproliferative activity against B and T cells, which demonstrates their potential application as immunosuppressive agents. In particular, compound 18 exhibited potent B-cell inhibitory activity (IC(50) = 1.78 \u03bcM) and presents a B-cell-specific profile with 17- and 26-fold selectivities toward T and Jurkat cells, respectively.",

        "abstract": "A\u03b2(1-42) is the proteolytic cleavage product of cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein by \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases. The aggregation of A\u03b2(1-42) plays a causative role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. To lock A\u03b2(1-42) in a homogenous state, we embedded the A\u03b2(1-42) sequence in an unstructured region of Bcl-x(L). Both the N-terminus and the C-terminus of A\u03b2(1-42) were constrained in the disordered region, whereas the conjunction did not introduce any folding to A\u03b2(1-42) but maintained the sequence as a monomer in solution. With Bcl-x(L)-A\u03b2(42), we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to compare the affinity of compounds for monomeric A\u03b2(1-42). Bcl-x(L)-A\u03b2(42) was coated on a microplate and this was followed by incubation with different concentrations of compounds. Compounds binding to Leu17-Val24 of A\u03b2(1-42) inhibited the interaction between Bcl-x(L)-A\u03b2(42) and antibody 4G8. The method can not only reproduce the activities of the reported A\u03b2(1-42) inhibitors such as dopamine, tannin, and morin but can also differentiate decoy compounds that do not bind to A\u03b2(1-42). Remarkably, using this method, we discovered a new inhibitor that binds to monomeric A\u03b2(1-42) and inhibits A\u03b2(1-42) fibril formation. As the structure of Bcl-x(L)-A\u03b2(42) monomer is stable in solution, the assay could be adapted for high-throughput screening with a series of antibodies that bind the different epitopes of A\u03b2(1-42). In addition, the monomeric form of the A\u03b2(1-42) sequence in Bcl-x(L)-A\u03b2(42) would also facilitate the identification of A\u03b2(1-42) binding partners by coimmunoprecipitation, cocrystallization, surface plasmon resonance technology, or the assay as described here.",

        "abstract": "Natural products, containing inherently large-scale structural diversity than synthetic compounds, have been the major resources of bioactive agents and will continually play as protagonists for discovering new drugs. However, how to access this diverse chemical space efficiently and effectively is an exciting challenge for medicinal chemists and pharmacologists. While virtual screening, which has shown a great promise in drug discovery, will play an important role in digging out lead (active) compounds from natural products. This review focuses on the strategy of virtual screening based on molecular docking and, with successful examples from our laboratory, illustrates the efficiency of virtual screening in discovering active compounds from natural products. On the other hand, the sequencing of the human genome and numerous pathogen genomes has resulted in an unprecedented opportunity for discovering potential new drug targets. Chemogenomics has appeared as a new technology to initiate target discovery by using active compounds as probes to characterize proteome functions. Natural products are the ideal probes for such research. Binding affinity fingerprint is a powerful chemogenomic descriptor to characterize both small molecules and pharmacologically relevant proteins. Therefore, this review also discusses binding affinity fingerprint strategy for identifying target information from the genomic data by using natural products as the probes.",

        "abstract": "Glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) is a principal glucose transporter in response to insulin, and impaired translocation or decreased expression of GLUT4 is believed to be one of the major pathological features of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Therefore, induction of GLUT4 translocation or/and expression is a promising strategy for anti-T2DM drug discovery. Here we report that the natural product (+)-Rutamarin (Rut) functions as an efficient dual inducer on both insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation and expression. Rut-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes exhibit efficiently enhanced insulin-induced glucose uptake, while diet-induced obese (DIO) mice based assays further confirm the Rut-induced improvement of glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in vivo. Subsequent investigation of Rut acting targets indicates that as a specific protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibitor Rut induces basal GLUT4 translocation to some extent and largely enhances insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation through PI3 kinase-AKT/PKB pathway, while as an agonist of retinoid X receptor \u03b1 (RXR\u03b1), Rut potently increases GLUT4 expression. Furthermore, by using molecular modeling and crystallographic approaches, the possible binding modes of Rut to these two targets have been also determined at atomic levels. All our results have thus highlighted the potential of Rut as both a valuable lead compound for anti-T2DM drug discovery and a promising chemical probe for GLUT4 associated pathways exploration.",

The pathogenic mechanism for DM is complex, and the complicated networks related to this disease involve distinct signaling pathways. Currently, discovery of potential modulators targeting these pathways has become a potent approach for anti-diabetic drug lead compound development. Compared with synthetic compounds, natural products provide inherent larger-scale structural diversity and have been the major resource of bioactive agents for new drug discovery. To date, more and more active components from plants or marine organisms have been reported to regulate diabetic pathophysiological signaling pathways and exhibit anti-diabetic activity. This review will summarize the regulation of natural small molecules on some key signaling pathways involved in DM. These pathways include insulin signaling pathway, carbohydrate metabolism pathway, the pathways involving insulin secretion and PPAR regulation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and inflammation related pathways and chromatin modification pathways.",

        "abstract": "Molecular recognition of a series of oxadiazole-substituted alpha-isopropoxy phenylpropanoic acids by PPARalpha and PPARgamma was investigated by using molecular modeling and 3D-QSAR analyses. The binding models of these compounds were determined by hydrophobic property analyses and molecular docking procedure FlexX. It was found that the hydrophilic heads of these compounds form four specific conserved hydrogen bonds with the ligand binding pockets of PPARalpha and PPARgamma, which results in fixed head conformations. On the contrary, their hydrophobic tails adopt different configurations to make contacts with hydrophobic region. The oxadiazole-ring-related hydrogen bond interactions well elucidate the structural features governing the different binding behavior of these agonists against PPARalpha and PPARgamma. Based on these active conformations, highly predictive comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) models were derived, which not only is consistent with the experimental results but also could be mapped back to the receptor topology and the ligand-receptor interaction models. The simulation results reveal the structure-activity relationship of these compounds at the molecular level and provide new insights for the design of novel potent PPARalpha and PPARgamma dual agonists.",

        "abstract": "LBVS of 12480 in-house compounds, followed by HTRF assay, resulted in one nonsteroidal compound (11) with antagonistic activity against FXR (69.01 \u00b1 11.75 \u03bcM). On the basis of 11, 26 new derivatives (12a-z) were designed and synthesized accordingly. Five derivatives (12f-g, 12p, 12u, and 12y) showed better antagonistic activities against FXR than compound 11. Remarkably, the most potent derivative, 12u (8.96 \u00b1 3.62 \u03bcM), showed antagonistic capability approximately 10 times and 8-fold higher than that of the control (GS) and the starting compound 11, respectively. 12u was further confirmed to have high binding affinity with FXR\u03b1LBD, FXR specificity over six other nuclear receptors, and potent antagonistic activity against FXR in two cell testing platforms. 12u strongly suppressed the regulating effects of CDCA on FXR target genes. The therapeutic potential of 12u was identified by lowering the contents of triglyceride and cholesterol in human hepatoma HepG2 cells and in the cholesterol-fed C57BL/6 mices.",

        "abstract": "A\u03b2 peptides cleaved from the amyloid precursor protein are the main components of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease. A\u03b2 peptides adopt a conformation mixture of random coil, \u03b2-sheet, and \u03b1-helix in solution, which makes it difficult to design inhibitors based on the 3D structures of A\u03b2 peptides. By targeting the C-terminal \u03b2-sheet region of an A\u03b2 intermediate structure extracted from molecular dynamics simulations of A\u03b2 conformational transition, a new inhibitor that abolishes A\u03b2 fibrillation was discovered using virtual screening in conjunction with thioflavin T fluorescence assay and atomic force microscopy determination. Circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrated that the binding of the inhibitor increased the \u03b2-sheet content of A\u03b2 peptides either by stabilizing the C-terminal \u03b2-sheet conformation or by inducing the intermolecular \u03b2-sheet formation. It was proposed that the inhibitor prevented fibrillation by blocking interstrand hydrogen bond formation of the pleated \u03b2-sheet structure commonly found in amyloid fibrils. The study not only provided a strategy for inhibitor design based on the flexible structures of amyloid peptides but also revealed some clues to understanding the molecular events involved in A\u03b2 aggregation. \u00a9 2006 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) is a key signal transducer of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). This study was conducted to clarify the potential role of ATF6 in the insulin signaling pathway under chronic ER stress.ER stress of HEK293 cells was induced with tunicamycin (2 \u03bcg/mL). The cells were transfected with ATF6\u03b1 or ATF6\u03b2. The phosphorylation level of insulin receptor (IR) was analyzed using Western blot. The changes in ER stress and ERK signaling pathways were explored using Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR.Tunicamycin-induced chronic ER stress attenuated IR tyrosine phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner, whereas over-expression of ATF6 protected IR from desensitization. ATF6 modulation of IR suppression was associated with insulin-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. The treatment of the cells with a specific ERK inhibitor U0126 (10 \u03bcmol/L) mimicked the effect of ATF6 over-expression and restored the insulin-stimulated IR phosphorylation. The treatment of the cells with the ERK activator epidermal growth factor (EGF, 200 ng/mL) decreased the protection effect of ATF6 on IR.Our results demonstrate that ATF6 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",

In this process, Lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75) is discovered to function as a cellular co-factor for integration. Since LEDGF/p75 plays an important role in HIV integration, disruption of the LEDGF/p75 interaction with IN has provided a special interest for anti-HIV agent discovery. In this work, we reported that a benzoic acid derivative, 4-[(5-bromo-4-{[2,4-dioxo-3-(2-oxo-2-phenylethyl)-1,3-thiazolidin-5-ylidene]methyl}-2-ethoxyphenoxy)methyl]benzoic acid (D77) could potently inhibit the IN-LEDGF/p75 interaction and affect the HIV-1 IN nuclear distribution thus exhibiting antiretroviral activity. Molecular docking with site-directed mutagenesis analysis and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding assays has clarified possible binding mode of D77 against HIV-1 integrase. As the firstly discovered small molecular compound targeting HIV-1 integrase interaction with LEDGF/p75, D77 might supply useful structural information for further anti-HIV agent discovery.",

        "abstract": "Physical inactivity is considered as one of the potential risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases, while endurance exercise training could enhance fat oxidation that is associated with insulin sensitivity improvement in obesity. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as an energy sensor plays pivotal roles in the regulation of energy homeostasis, and its activation could improve glucose uptake, promote mitochondrial biogenesis and increase glycolysis. Recent research has even suggested that AMPK activation contributed to endurance enhancement without exercise. Here we report that the natural product arctigenin from the traditional herb Arctium lappa L. (Compositae) strongly increased AMPK phosphorylation and subsequently up-regulated its downstream pathway in both H9C2 and C2C12 cells. It was discovered that arctigenin phosphorylated AMPK via calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) and serine/threonine kinase 11(LKB1)-dependent pathways. Mice treadmill based in vivo assay further indicated that administration of arctigenin improved efficiently mice endurance as reflected by the increased fatigue time and distance, and potently enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) related genes expression in muscle tissues. Our results thus suggested that arctigenin might be used as a potential lead compound for the discovery of the agents with mimic exercise training effects to treat metabolic diseases.",

All the compounds showed inhibitory potencies, and 10 of these exhibited moderate inhibitory activities with IC(50) values less than 10 microM. The activity of the most potent compound P28 (IC(50)=2.1 microM) was 15 times higher than that of the hit compound P01. Further, four representative compounds (P19, P22, P28, and P31) demonstrated remarkably high selectivities against other PTPs (e.g., PTPalpha, LAR, CD45, and TCPTP); P19 exhibited greater than sixfold selectivity over highly homologous TCPTP. More importantly, these compounds are permeable to cell membranes. The treatment of CHO-K1 cells with P28 (10 microM) resulted in increased phosphorylation of AKT, which suggested extensive cellular activity of this compound. The novel chemical entities reported in this study could be used for overcoming the poor selectivity and low cellular activity of PTP1B inhibitors and might represent a starting point for development of therapeutic PTP inhibitors.",

Quercetin (3,3',4',5,7-pentahydroxyflavone) and apigenin (4',5,7-trihydroxyflavone) are two representative flavonoids, both of which have been reported to possess antibacterial activity by acting on multiple targets. Here, we determined that d-alanine:d-alanine ligase (Ddl) is another new target for quercetin and apigenin. Kinetic analysis indicated that these two flavonoids function as reversible inhibitors that are competitive with the substrate ATP of Ddl, whereas they are non-competitive with the other substrate d-Ala. The fact that quercetin showed lower 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) and inhibitor binding constant (K(i)) values than apigenin against both the Helicobacter pylori Ddl and the Escherichia coli DdlB implies that the two additional hydroxyls on the flavone skeleton of quercetin in structure might facilitate its inhibitory activity and binding affinity to Ddl. This work is expected to help shed more light on the potential antibacterial mechanism of flavonoids.",

        "abstract": "The 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)) of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is one of the most promising targets for discovery of drugs against SARS, because of its critical role in the viral life cycle. In this study, a natural compound called quercetin-3-beta-galactoside was identified as an inhibitor of the protease by molecular docking, SPR/FRET-based bioassays, and mutagenesis studies. Both molecular modeling and Q189A mutation revealed that Gln189 plays a key role in the binding. Furthermore, experimental evidence showed that the secondary structure and enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) were not affected by the Q189A mutation. With the help of molecular modeling, eight new derivatives of the natural product were designed and synthesized. Bioassay results reveal salient features of the structure-activity relationship of the new compounds: (1) removal of the 7-hydroxy group of the quercetin moiety decreases the bioactivity of the derivatives; (2) acetoxylation of the sugar moiety abolishes inhibitor action; (3) introduction of a large sugar substituent on 7-hydroxy of quercetin can be tolerated; (4) replacement of the galactose moiety with other sugars does not affect inhibitor potency. This study not only reveals a new class of compounds as potential drug leads against the SARS virus, but also provides a solid understanding of the mechanism of inhibition against the target enzyme.",

        "abstract": "Malaria is caused by protozoan erythrocytic parasites of the Plasmodium genus, with Plasmodium falciparum being the most dangerous and widespread disease-causing species. Falcipain-2 (FP-2) of P. falciparum is a papain-family (C1A) cysteine protease that plays an important role in the parasite life cycle by degrading erythrocyte proteins, most notably hemoglobin. Inhibition of FP-2 and its paralogues prevents parasite maturation, suggesting these proteins may be valuable targets for the design of novel antimalarial drugs, but lack of structural knowledge has impeded progress toward the rational discovery of potent, selective, and efficacious inhibitors. As a first step toward this goal, we present here the crystal structure of mature FP-2 at 3.1 A resolution, revealing novel structural features of the FP-2 subfamily proteases including a dynamic beta-hairpin hemoglobin binding motif, a flexible N-terminal alpha-helical extension, and a unique active-site cleft. We also demonstrate by biochemical methods that mature FP-2 can proteolytically process its own precursor in trans at neutral to weakly alkaline pH, that the binding of hemoglobin to FP-2 is strictly pH-dependent, and that FP-2 preferentially binds methemoglobin over hemoglobin. Because the specificity and proteolytic activity of FP-2 toward its multiple targets appears to be pH-dependent, we suggest that environmental pH may play an important role in orchestrating FP-2 function over the different life stages of the parasite. Moreover, it appears that selectivity of FP-2 for methemoglobin may represent an evolutionary adaptation to oxidative stress conditions within the host cell.",

        "abstract": "Sirtuins are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent deacetylases that catalyze the deacetylation of proteins such as histones and p53. A sensitive and convenient fluorometric assay for evaluating the SIRT1 enzymatic activity was developed here. Specifically, the remaining NAD(+) after the deacetylation was determined by converting NAD(+) to a highly fluorescent cyclized alpha-adduct compound. By this assay, we found that nicotinamide, Cu(2+), and Zn(2+) antagonize the activity of SIRT1. Resveratrol stimulates the enzymatic activity specifically with 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC)-labeled acetylated peptide. Epigallocatechin galate (EGCG) inhibits SIRT1 activity with both AMC-labeled and unlabeled peptide. However, a combination of vitamin C with EGCG can reverse the inhibition of EGCG with the unlabeled peptide or stimulate the deacetylation of AMC-labeled peptide by SIRT1. The assay does not require any isotopic material and thus is biologically safe. It can be adapted to a 96-well microplate for high-throughput screening. Notably, the acetylated peptides with or without fluorescent labels may be used in the assay, which facilitates the substrate specificity study of SIRT1 activators or inhibitors in vitro.",

        "abstract": "Type II fatty acid synthesis (FAS II) is an essential process for bacteria survival, and malonyl-CoA:acyl carrier protein transacylase (MCAT) is a key enzyme in FAS II pathway, which is responsible for transferring the malonyl group from malonyl-CoA to the holo-ACP by forming malonyl-ACP. In this work, we described the cloning, characterization and enzymatic inhibition of a new MCAT from Helicobacter pylori strain SS1 (HpMCAT), and the gene sequence of HpfabD was deposited in the GenBank database (Accession No. AY738332 ). Enzymatic characterization of HpMCAT showed that the K(m) value for malonyl-CoA was 21.01+/-2.3 microM, and the thermal- and guanidinium hydrochloride-induced unfolding processes for HpMCAT were quantitatively investigated by circular dichroism spectral analyses. Moreover, a natural product, corytuberine, was discovered to demonstrate inhibitory activity against HpMCAT with IC(50) value at 33.1+/-3.29 microM. Further enzymatic assay results indicated that corytuberine inhibits HpMCAT in an uncompetitive manner. To our knowledge, this is the firstly reported MCAT inhibitor to date. This current work is hoped to supply useful information for better understanding the MCAT features of H. pylori strain, and corytuberine might be used as a potential lead compound in the discovery of the antibacterial agents using HpMCAT as target.",

        "abstract": "The natural product oleanolic acid (OA) has been discovered to exhibit varied pharmacological functions including anti-inflammation, anti-tumor and anti-diabetes, while appropriate synthetic oleanolic acid derivatives seem to possess more potent activities. Here we identified a new oleanolic acid derivative, 3-beta-(2-carboxybenzoyloxy)-oleanolic acid (NPLC441), which functioned as a competitive PTP1B inhibitor and enhanced insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IR and AKT in HepG2 cells. As an RXRalpha antagonist, it could selectively activate LXRalpha:RXRalpha heterodimer and increase the promoter activities of ABCA1 and ABCG1 genes in transient transfection assays. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analyses suggested that NPLC441 could up-regulate GLUT4 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and such effect was further proved to be dependent on LXRalpha:RXRalpha activation. Moreover, 2-deoxyglucose uptake technology-based characterization demonstrated that this compound could stimulate glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Finally, NPLC441 was observed to be able to suppress 11beta-HSD(1) expression in HepG2 cells, following the discovery that activation of LXRalpha:RXRalpha could repress the expression of 11beta-HSD(1). Compared with NPLC441, OA showed no effects on the transactivation of either LXRalpha:RXRalpha heterodimer or RXRalpha-LBD. Our work is thus expected to provide a new insight into the anti-diabetic application for oleanolic acid derivatives via multi-target mechanism, and NPLC441 could be used as a potential lead compound for further research.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To predict the probable genomic packaging signal of SARS-CoV by bioinformatics analysis. The derived packaging signal may be used to design antisense RNA and RNA interfere (RNAi) drugs treating SARS. METHODS: Based on the studies about the genomic packaging signals of MHV and BCoV, especially the information about primary and secondary structures, the putative genomic packaging signal of SARS_CoV were analyzed by using bioinformatic tools. Multi-alignment for the genomic sequences was performed among SARS-CoV, MHV, BCoV, PEDV and HCoV 229E. Secondary structures of RNA sequences were also predicted for the identification of the possible genomic packaging signals. Meanwhile, the N and M proteins of all five viruses were analyzed to study the evolutionary relationship with genomic packaging signals. RESULTS: The putative genomic packaging signal of SARS-CoV locates at the 3' end of ORF1b near that of MHV and BCoV, where is the most variable region of this gene. The RNA secondary structure of SARS-CoV genomic packaging signal is very similar to that of MHV and BCoV. The same result was also obtained in studying the genomic packaging signals of PEDV and HCoV 229E. Further more, the genomic sequence multi-alignment indicated that the locations of packaging signals of SARS- CoV, PEDV, and HCoV overlaped each other. It seems that the mutation rate of packaging signal sequences is much higher than the N protein, while only subtle variations for the M protein. CONCLUSIONS: The probable genomic packaging signal of SARS-CoV is analogous to that of MHV and BCoV, with the corresponding secondary RNA structure locating at the similar region of ORF1b. The positions where genomic packaging signals exist have suffered rounds of mutations, which may influence the primary structures of the N and M proteins consequently.",

        "abstract": "HIV-1 integrase (IN) is composed of three domains, the N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 1-50), the catalytic core domain (CCD, residues 51-212), and the C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 213-288). All the three domains are required for the two known integration reactions. CCD contains the catalytic triad and is believed to bind viral DNA specifically, and CTD binds viral DNA in a nonspecific manner. As no clear evidence has confirmed the involvement of NTD in DNA binding directly, NTD has not been seriously considered and less is known about its function in viral replication. In the current work, using a SPR technology-based assay, the HIV-1 viral DNA was determined to bind directly to NTD with a K(D) value of 8.8 microM, suggesting that the process of preintegrated complex formation for HIV-1 IN might involve the direct interaction of NTD with viral DNA in addition to binding of viral DNA to the catalytic core domain and C-terminal domain. Moreover, such viral DNA/IN binding could be inhibited by the marine product hyrtiosal from the marine sponge Hyrtios erectus with an IC(50) of 9.60+/-0.86 microM. Molecular dynamic analysis correlated with a site-directed mutagenesis approach further revealed that such hyrtiosal-induced viral DNA/IN binding inhibition was caused by the fact that hyrtiosal could bind HIV-1 NTD at Ser17, Trp19, and Lys34. As hyrtiosal was recently discovered by us as a protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibitor,1 this work might also supply multiple-target information for this marine product, and the verified HIV-NTD/HIV-1 IN interaction model could have further implications for new HIV-1 IN inhibitor design and evaluation.",

        "title": "Butyl 4-(butyryloxy)benzoate functions as a new selective estrogen receptor \u03b2 agonist and induces GLUT4 expression in CHO-K1 cells",
        "abstract": "Estrogen receptors (ERs) belong to nuclear hormone receptor superfamily and can be activated by estrogens and regulate many target genes. Two ER isoforms, ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 have been discovered to date and ER\u03b2 was indicated to involve in anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetogenic effects. Recently, some studies also demonstrated an association between ER\u03b2 and GLUT4 expression. The development of selective ER\u03b2 ligand has facilitated probing its novel biological functions and clinical benefits. In this work, a new ER\u03b2 selective agonist, butyl 4-(butyryloxy)benzoate (DCW234), was discovered as investigated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology, yeast two-hybrid and cell-based transcription-based assays. SPR results demonstrated that DCW234 has a higher binding affinity against ER\u03b2 over ER\u03b1 and induces a strong and selective stimulation on ER\u03b2/SRC1 interaction, which could be efficiently blocked by Tamoxifen. Meanwhile, the yeast two-hybrid technology-based assay indicated that DCW234 exhibits a higher agonistic activity (\u223c13-fold) in stimulating ER\u03b2 ligand-binding domain (LBD) interaction with SRC1 (EC 50 = 2.5 \u03bcM) than ER\u03b1-LBD/SRC1 interaction (EC 50 = 32.7 \u03bcM). The cell-based transcriptional assay further proved the potency and selectivity of DCW234. Moreover, DCW234 was found to be able to induce GLUT4 expression in CHO-K1 cell. The discovered DCW234 might be hopefully developed as a potential lead compound for further research. Keywords Estrogen receptor Butyl 4-(butyryloxy)benzoate Surface plasmon resonance Selective agonist Yeast two-hybrid system Glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) 1 Introduction Estrogen receptors (ERs) belong to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors [1,2] . There are two subtypes of ERs encoded by different genes: ER\u03b1 [3] and ER\u03b2 [4] , both of which can be activated by estrogens and subsequently bind to the estrogen receptor element (ERE), recruit coregulatory proteins and regulate the transcription of many target genes. The current knowledge is that ER\u03b1, but not ER\u03b2, participates in mediating the \u201cclassic\u201d estrogen model systems such as the reproductive tract and skeleton [5] . In addition, the profiling of ER\u03b2 selective agonists in several animal models of human disease indicated that these compounds might have utility as novel anti-inflammatory agents [6] , whereas the exact physiological roles of ER\u03b2 is still being defined. Human ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 exhibit different characteristics in their tissue distribution and ligand specificities. ER\u03b1 is predominant in uterus, liver, mammary gland, bone and cardiovascular systems, whereas ER\u03b2 expresses at high level in the prostate, ovary, and urinary tract [7] . These distribution patterns suggest that a selective ER\u03b2 agonist could emulate estradiol's actions in a variety of target tissues without the side effects such as the induction of uterus and breast cancer by estrogen [8] . Although the ligand-binding domains (LBDs) of ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 showed only 58% identity in amino acid sequence [9] , the crystal structures [10,11] revealed that there are only two residues different in the ligand-binding pockets: ER\u03b1 Leu384 was replaced by ER\u03b2 Met336, and ER\u03b1 Met421 by ER\u03b2 ILe373. Thus, this result can explain the similar affinity of 17\u03b2-estradiol to both ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 and also highlight why only limited achievements have been made for the attempt to find highly selective ER ligands to date. Since the two ER subtypes might play distinct biological roles in a ligand-dependent manner as revealed in ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 knockout mice [12] , the discovery of novel ER selective ligands has become one of the major focuses in the pharmaceutical industry. Although estrogens play important roles in the regulation of numerous physiological processes, e.g. the development and function of female reproductive system and the maintenance of bone mineral density and cardiovascular health, therapy by estrogens was found to increase the risk of stroke, venous thromboembolism, cancer and dementia [13] . As the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), raloxifene and tamoxifen can enhance bone mineral density, decrease the incidence of breast cancer and prevent osteoporosis [14\u201316] , but fail to prevent the incidence of hot flashes [17] . In addition, although there are a number of ligands exhibiting good selectivity for ER\u03b1 (such as PPT, MPP, 16\u03b1-LE2, etc.), only few ER\u03b2 selective agonists have been reported to date, e.g. Geinstain [7] , DPN [18] and ERB041 [19] . Furthermore, these compounds have been shown to induce DNA strand breaks, chromosomal aberrations and other unwanted side effects [6] . Therefore, all these findings have fueled an intensive effort to discover novel highly selective ER\u03b2 ligands that might not cause the side effects mentioned above. Besides, the accurate evaluation of the ER\u03b2-mediated biological activities also requires simultaneous testing a wide range of highly selective ER\u03b2 ligands. On the other hand, some studies have indicated that estradiol plays a role in glucose homeostasis by modulating some genes that are involved in insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake [20\u201322] . In addition, ER\u03b2 has also been proved to participate in the regulation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) expression. These discoveries might thereby open up a new perspective for ER as targets to cure diabetes mellitus type 2. Therefore, researchers have made great efforts to develop tissue and isoforms selective ER modulators, and hope to find drugs that can alleviate and cure diabetes mellitus by selectively regulating the activity of either ER\u03b1 or ER\u03b2. In this work, by random screening against the in-house compound library, we discovered that butyl 4-(butyryloxy)benzoate (DCW234, Fig. 1 ) functioned as a new selective ER\u03b2 agonist, as investigated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology, yeast two-hybrid and cell-based transcriptional assays. Moreover, this compound also exhibited some capability in inducing GLUT4 expression in CHO-K1 cells. It is expected that this new determined ER\u03b2 selective agonist might be developed as a potential lead compound for further research. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials The restriction and modification enzymes in this work were purchased from NEB.

NC_000006.10 and NC_000014.7 ), Human ER\u03b1-LBD (aa 301\u2013553) and ER\u03b2-LBD (aa 253\u2013500) were sub-cloned into vector pET-15b using EcoRI/BamHI and NdeI/BamHI restrict enzyme sites. The primers used for PCR amplification were listed as follows: ER\u03b1-LBD (sense) 5\u2032-CG GAATTC TCTAAGAAGAACAGCCTGGCC-3\u2032, (anti-sense) 5\u2032-AA GGATCC AGTGGGCGCATGTAGGCGGT-3\u2032; ER\u03b2-LBD (sense) 5\u2032-AATT CATATG TTTGCTCGTACCCGCTCA-3\u2032, (anti-sense) 5\u2032-ATAT GGATCC TCTTAAAGCACGTGGGCATTCAG-3\u2032. SRC1 (aa 613\u2013773), digested by NdeI and BamHI, was sub-cloned into pET-15b using the following primers: (sense) 5\u2032-CA GAATTC CATAACAATGACAGACTTTCA-3\u2032 and (anti-sense) 5\u2032-AA GGATCC CACCTTTACATCATCCAGGCT-3\u2032. The mouse GLUT4 promoter (\u22123225 to +181, relative to the GLUT4 transcription initiation site, without any AUG codons) was amplified by KOD polymerase (Toyobo) and ligated into NheI/XhoI-digested pGL3-Basic vector ( http://www.promega.com/ ). The plasmid pGL2-ERE3-Luc was kindly donated by Dr. Sofia Ramos (Dpto. Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Universidad de Oviedo, Spain). 2.3 Protein preparation The recombinant plasmid of pET15b-ER\u03b1-LBD (LBD, ligand-binding domain) was transformed into BL21 (DE3) E. coli bacteria, and cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C until an OD 600 of 1.0. Expression was induced by adding isopropyl \u03b2- d -thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to 0.2 mM, and the cells were grown for an additional 5 h at 25 \u00b0C. Then the cells were harvested by centrifugation for 30 min at 4000 rpm, 4 \u00b0C and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C overnight. Afterwards the frozen cells were thawed, re-suspended in 20 mL of binding buffer (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH 8.0), and disrupted by sonication. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 15,000 \u00d7 g and 4 \u00b0C for 30 min and the supernatant was loaded onto a Sepharose Ni-NTA column (Amersham Pharmacia) pre-equilibrated with binding buffer. After the column was washed with washing buffer (20 mL; 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 0.5 M NaCl, 60 mM imidazole, pH 8.0), the protein of interest was eluted with elution buffer (10 mL; 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole, pH 8.0). The fractions containing the target protein were identified by SDS-PAGE. Imidazole was removed by dialysis of the protein samples against the corresponding buffer when needed. The expression and purification of ER\u03b2-LBD and SRC1-NRID (NRID, nuclear receptor interacting domain) were performed in a way similar to that of ER\u03b1-LBD. 2.4 Recombinant vectors construction for yeast two-hybrid assay The yeast vectors of pGADT7 and pGBKT7 were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The cDNA of ER\u03b1 was amplified with the following primers: 5\u2032-CG GAATTC TCT AAGAAGAACAGCCTGGCC-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032-AA GGATCC AGTGGGCGCATGTAGGCGGT-3\u2032 (anti-sense). The cDNA of ER\u03b2 was amplified with the following primers: 5\u2032-TATA CATATG GACAAGGAGTTGGTACACATG-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032-AA GGATCC AAGCACGTGGGCATTCAG-3\u2032 (anti-sense). The amplified products of ER\u03b1 (aa 301\u2013553) and ER\u03b2 (aa 253\u2013500) were digested with EcoRI and BamHI, followed by cloning into the pGBKT7 vector between these two sites. The cDNA of SRC1 was amplified with the following primers: 5\u2032-CA GAATTCC ATAACAATGACAGACTTTCAG-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032-AA GGATCC CACCTTTACATCATCCAGGCT-3\u2032 (anti-sense). The amplified products of SRC1-NRID (aa 613\u2013773) were digested with EcoRI and BamHI, and then cloned into the pGADT7 vector. 2.5 Yeast transformation and culture The yeast strain AH109 was obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA), and transformation was performed according to the lithium acetate method [23] . Briefly, 500 ng of plasmid DNA was added to 50 \u03bcL of the competent cells and mixed with 36 \u03bcL of 1 M lithium acetate and 240 \u03bcL of 50% PEG3350 and 50 ng single-strain DNA at 30 \u00b0C for 30 min, followed by heat-shock (250 rpm) at 42 \u00b0C for 30 min. The mixture was subsequently spread on a drop-out-agar plate without leucine and tryptophan (SD-T \u2212 L \u2212 ). The plates were incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 48 h for yeast growth and the PCR method was used to confirm the successful transformation of the target gene. 2.6 \u03b1-Galactosidase activity assay The quantitative \u03b1-galactosidase activity assays were carried out by using p -nitrophenyl \u03b1- d -galactopyranoside (PNP-\u03b1-Gal) as the substrate according to the Clontech manual. The \u03b1-galactosidase activity was calculated according to the following formula: \u03b1 -galactosidase \u2009\u200a\u200a activity \u2009\u200a\u200a [ milliunits / ( mL \u00d7 cell ) ] = O D 410 \u00d7 V f \u00d7 1000 ( \u03be \u00d7 b ) \u00d7 t \u00d7 V i \u00d7 O D 600 where t is the elapsed time of incubation (min), V f is the final volume of assay (200 \u03bcL), V i is the volume of culture medium supernatant added (16 \u03bcL), OD 600 is the optical density of overnight culture, and \u03be \u00d7 b is the p -nitrophenol molar absorptivity at 410 nm \u00d7 the light path (cm) = 10.5 (mL/mol; Yeast Protocols Handbook PT3024-1, Clontech). 2.7 Cell transfection and luciferase assays CHO-K1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium/F12 with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% FBS without phenol red at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO 2 . Cells were seeded in 24-well plate and 24 h later cotransfected by 150 ng or 300 ng of ER expression vector, 50 ng of pRL-SV40 with 500 ng of p2ERE-luc reporter plasmid using SuperFect as carrier. After 5 h, the transfection medium was removed and replaced with culture medium containing either increasing concentrations of estradiol or DCW234. After 24 h, the cells were harvested and the luciferase activity was measured with the dual luciferase assay system, and the firefly luciferase activity was corrected for transfection efficiency based on the internal control vector pRL-SV40, and the final results were expressed as the relative luciferase units (RLU). In addition, to visualize possible unspecific effects of DCW234 against the vector, we have also tested the activity of DCW234 (100 \u03bcM) against the pGL3-Basic control vector (data not shown). The results showed that the compound DCW234 has no any activity against the control vector. 2.8 SPR technology-based assay The binding affinity of DCW234 to ER\u03b1-LBD or ER\u03b2-LBD was determined by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based Biacore 3000 instrument. During the SPR experiment, the ER\u03b1(\u03b2)-LBD was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip with N -ethyl- N \u2032-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and N -hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the standard primary amine-coupling procedures, and HBS-EP (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P 20 ) was used as the running buffer. Equilibration of the baseline was performed by a continuous flow of HBS-EP through the chip surface for 2\u20133 h. Biacore data were collected at 25 \u00b0C with HBS-EP as the running buffer at a constant flow of 30 \u03bcL/min. DCW234 was serially diluted into the running buffer to a final DMSO concentration of 0.1%. The samples were injected into the channels at a flow rate of 30 \u03bcL/min, followed by washing with the running buffer. The equilibrium dissociation constant ( K D ), the association ( k on ) and dissociation ( k off ) rate constants were determined by analysis of the sensorgram-curves obtained at different concentrations of DCW234 by use of BIA evaluation software version 3.1 (Biacore) and the 1:1 Langmuir binding fitting model. 3 Results 3.1 DCW234 showed binding selectivity against ER\u03b2-LBD over ER\u03b1-LBD To investigate the binding affinity of DCW234 against ER\u03b1(\u03b2)-LBD, SPR-based Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore AB, Rapsgatan 7, S-754 50 Uppsala, Sweden) was used. During the experiment, the binding signals in response units (RUs) were continuously recorded and presented graphically as a function of time ( Fig. 2 ). The kinetic parameters (the equilibrium dissociation constant K D ; association rate constant k on and dissociation constant, k off ) of ER\u03b1(\u03b2)/DCW234 interaction were then determined by 1:1 Langmuir binding model. The curve fitting efficiency was evaluated by statistical parameter \u03c7 2 . All the results are summarized in Table 1 . As shown in Fig. 2 A and B, the results showed similar binding affinities of raloxifen to both ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 with K D values of 0.38 and 0.25 \u03bcM, respectively, in good agreement with the reported values [24] , thus demonstrating the reliability of the SPR system for ER ligand discovery. Fig. 2 C and D showed the binding affinities of serially diluted DCW234 to ER\u03b1-LBD and ER\u03b2-LBD, respectively. The fitted kinetic parameters thereby revealed a seven-fold higher affinity of DCW234 to ER\u03b2 ( K D = 3.43 \u03bcM) than to ER\u03b1 ( K D = 22.5 \u03bcM), demonstrating a moderate binding selectivity against ER\u03b2-LBD over ER\u03b1-LBD. 3.2 DCW234 selectively stimulated ER\u03b2-LBD/SRC1-NRID interaction 3.2.1 SPR technology-based assay It has been well recognized that ER can exert its transactivation activity on the target genes by its ligand-binding domain to recruit one of the nuclear receptor co-activators [10] , and subsequently increase or decrease mRNA transcription and protein production of the target genes, thus inducing the corresponding physiological responses [21] . The relevant nuclear receptor co-activators include SRC1/p160 [25,26] , TIF-2/GRIP-1 [27,28] , RIP-140 [29] , and CBP/p300 [30,31] , among which the steroid receptor co-activator SRC1 has been revealed to interact with ER through seven LXXLL motifs (where L is leucine and X is any amino acid) that are necessary and sufficient to mediate the binding of SRC1 to ER [32] . In order to explore the agonistic activity of DCW234 against ER, SPR technology-based assay was carried out. As positive controls, the agonistic and antagonistic activities of E2 and Tamoxifen on ER\u03b1(\u03b2)-LBD/SRC1 interaction were investigated. As shown in Fig. 3 , E2 is able to enhance the interactions of both ER\u03b1-LBD (EC 50 = 8.66 nM) and ER\u03b2-LBD (EC 50 = 8.16 nM) with the coactivator SRC1. In contrast, DCW234 could efficiently stimulate ER\u03b2-LBD/SRC1 interaction by EC 50 at 1.71 \u03bcM while show less effect on ER\u03b1-LBD/SRC1 interaction (EC 50 = 19.8 \u03bcM), suggesting the selective agonistic activity of DCW234 against ER\u03b2 relative to ER\u03b1. To further confirm such an agonistic activity of DCW234, Tamoxifen, a reported ER antagonist, was also applied to block the stimulation effect of DCW234 on ER-LBD/SRC1 interaction. As the results shown in Fig. 3 D\u2013F, we found that Tamoxifen not only completely blocks ER-LBD/SRC1 interaction by itself, but also substantially reduces the effects of both E2 and DCW234 on stimulating ER-LBD/SRC1 interaction. All these results thus indicated that DCW234 functions as a classic ER agonist and stimulates the binding of SRC1 to ER\u03b2 more efficiently than that to ER\u03b1. This conclusion was further verified by the yeast two-hybrid assay as described below. 3.2.2 Yeast two-hybrid system-based assay To obtain more detailed information about the agonistic activity of DCW234 on ER, a yeast two-hybrid system was constructed. In detail, hER\u03b1/\u03b2-LBD and the central domain of SRC1 including three LXXLL motifs were cloned in-frame into the vectors pGBKT7 and pGADT7, respectively. After co-transforming the two constructs into yeast strain AH109, we successfully evaluated ER\u03b1/\u03b2/SRC1 interactions by conducting a convenient \u03b1-galactosidase assay based on the expression of MEL 1 reporter gene. To assess the reliability of the yeast two-hybrid system, we first determined the EC 50 values of E2 in stimulating ER\u03b1/SRC1 (0.1 nM) and ER\u03b2/SRC1 (0.12 nM) interactions. As shown in Fig. 4 A the values were almost identical with the reported results [24,33] , indicating that our system was suitable for analyzing the ligand-dependent interaction between ER\u03b1/\u03b2 and SRC1, and could be used in the following work. To further confirm the selective agonistic activity of DCW234, the EC 50 of DCW234 in stimulating ER\u03b1(\u03b2)/SRC1 interaction was also determined by the yeast two-hybrid system. As indicated in Fig. 4 B, DCW234 could enhance the binding of SRC1 to ER\u03b1-LBD and ER\u03b2-LBD with EC 50 values of 32.7 and 2.5 \u03bcM, respectively. From this result, we can conclude that this compound shows excellent potency as an ER agonist and possesses a modest selectivity (13-fold) against ER\u03b2, which is in good agreement with the SPR result. Moreover, we found that the agonistic effect of DCW234 could be effectively antagonized by Tamoxifen in the yeast two-hybrid system ( Fig. 5 ), which further verifies the agonistic character of DCW234. However, the opposing efficacy of Tamoxifen against DCW234's agonistic activity on ER/SRC1 interaction was different in the case of ER\u03b1 and \u03b2 isoforms. Compared to its almost complete blockade of the ER\u03b1-LBD/SRC1 interaction, Tamoxifen inhibited the binding of ER\u03b2-LBD to SRC1 only to a limited extent. Such difference might be attributed to the higher selectivity of DCW234 against ER\u03b2, since the agonistic activity of DCW234 on ER\u03b2 is stronger than that on ER\u03b1. In summary, our results have provided strong evidence that DCW234 is able to selectively stimulate ER-LBD/SRC1 interaction both in vitro and in vivo . 3.3 DCW234 selectively enhanced the binding of ER\u03b2 to the estrogen response elements (EREs) promoter site revealed by the cell transfection and luciferase assays Estradiol is well known to efficiently activate the high affinity binding of ERs to specific DNA sequences, e.g. the estrogen response elements (EREs) within the regulatory regions of target genes [34] . The binding of ligand plays an important role in inducing the activating conformational change and subsequent homo-dimerization of ER, therefore making it possible for ER to tightly bind to EREs. In order to better characterize DCW234's potency and selectivity against ER\u03b2, we thus tested its ability to enhance the stimulating effect of E2 on the transcription of an ERE-driven reporter gene at cellular level. As shown in Fig. 6 , DCW234 exhibited approximately 10-fold higher enhancement on the stimulating effect of E2 against ER\u03b2 than ER\u03b1, which is further verified that DCW234 is a novel ER\u03b2-selective agonist. 3.4 DCW234 can induce GLUT4 expression in CHO-K1 cells Some studies have demonstrated that estradiol or ER selective ligands play pivotal roles in insulin action, glucose metabolism and GLUT4 expression [20,22,35] . The discovery of the therapeutic compounds, which can selectively activate ER isoform thus increasing GLUT4 expression and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle tissue, might unfold a new horizon for illustration of glucose homeostasis and related disease. As indicated in Fig. 7 , by using the LXR agonist T0901307 as a positive control, DCW234 as an ER\u03b2-selective agonist shows an obvious ability to enhance GLUT4 expression in CHO-K1 cell. 4 Discussion Following the discovery of ER\u03b2, researchers and pharmaceutical companies have taken great efforts to develop tissue-selective ER modulators (SERMS) or isoforms-selective ER modulators (I-SERMS). For example, raloxifene, a benzothiophene derivative of nonsteroidal second generation SERM, acts as a classical antiestrogen to inhibits the growth of mammary or endometrial carcinoma and recently FDA has approved drugs for the treatment of osteoporosis [36] . The compound ERB041 was identified as a selective ER\u03b2 agonist and exhibited anti-inflammatory activity in preclinical models of arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease [6,19] . These findings thus suggest that the discovery of new selective ER ligand might make it possible to probe new ER related function and treat various ER-related diseases without serious side effects, e.g. cancer, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, etc. [37,38] . In this report, we have identified that DCW234 functions as a potent and selective ER\u03b2 agonist. SPR results clearly showed that DCW234 has a higher binding affinity to ER\u03b2 than ER\u03b1 and shows a stronger stimulation of the ER\u03b2-LBD/SRC1 interaction which could be efficiently blocked by Tamoxifen, a potent ER antagonist. The assay from the constructed yeast two-hybrid system confirmed that DCW234 exhibits stronger agonistic activity in stimulation ER\u03b2-LBD/SRC1 interaction, but weaker for ER\u03b1-LBD/SRC1. Additionally, Tamoxifen also could block DCW234 in the stimulation of the ER-LBD/SRC1 interaction in yeast and has a higher antagonistic for ER\u03b1 isofroms. Obviously, in this system, DCW234 showed excellent potency and possessed a modest selectivity (13-fold) for ER\u03b2, which is in good agreement with the SPR result. The cell transfection and luciferase assay further confirms that DCW234 functions as an ER\u03b2 potently selective agonist. Having established that DCW234 was a selective ER\u03b2 agonist, we sought to use it as a tool to probe ER\u03b2 related function and found that DCW234 could transactivate GLUT4-promoter in CHO-K1 cells ( Fig. 7 ). Studies such as experiments in ER\u03b1-Knockout and ER\u03b2-Knockout mice have reported the relationship between ER\u03b1 or ER\u03b2 and GLUT4 expression [20,22] . In the recent years, several transcription factors that modulate GLUT4 expression have been shown to interact with ERs, including SP1 [35] and NF-\u03baB [37,38] . Therefore, we conclude that DCW234 may affect the GLUT4 transactivation through ER, further confirming that ER is involved in regulating GLUT4 expression. It is hoped that our work could provide a useful approach in discovering ER\u03b2 selective agonists and it is also expected that this new determined ER\u03b2 selective agonist might be developed as a potential lead compound for further research.

We used molecular modeling to predict the binding sites recognized by an anti-IL-4-neutralizing mAb (11B.11) and peptide phage display to delineate their makeup. The results of these approaches were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis analysis. The results suggest that the amino acid residues spanning from 79 to 86 (QRLFRAFR) on IL-4 are of the major binding site for 11B.11. Furthermore, the functional experiments demonstrate that the residues R80, R83 and R86, which are located in the helix C of murine IL-4, play a crucial role in binding to the IL-4R alpha-chain. Taken together, a new core functional region of murine IL-4 is identified, which provides new insight into the interaction between IL-4 and IL-4Ralpha. In addition, the results demonstrate that 11B.11 binds to a core functional region of murine IL-4, which prevents this cytokine from interacting with its cognate receptor.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To constructed a three-dimensional (3D) model for the 3C like (3CL) proteinase of SARS coronavirus (SARS_CoV), and to design inhibitors of the 3CL proteinase based on the 3D model. METHODS: Bioinformatics analyses were performed to search the homologous proteins of the SARS_CoV 3CL proteinase from the GenBank and PDB database. A 3D model of the proteinase was constructed by using homology modeling technique. Target- ing to the 3D model and its X-ray crystal structure of the main proteinase (M pro ) of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), virtual screening was performed employing molecular docking method to identify possible 3CL proteinase inhibitors from small molecular databases. RESULTS: Sequence alignment indicated that the SARS_CoV 3CL proteinase was extremely homologous to TGEV M pro , especially the substrate-binding pocket (active site). Accordingly, a 3D model for the SARS_CoV 3CL proteinase was constructed based on the crystal structure of TGEV Mpro. The 3D model adopts a similar fold of the TGEV Mpro, its structure and binding pocket feature are almost as same as that of TGEV M pro . The tested virtual screening indicated that 73 available proteinase inhibitors in the MDDR database might dock into both the binding pockets of the TGEV M pro and the SARS_CoV 3CL proteinase. CONCLUSIONS: Either the 3D model of the SARS_CoV 3CL proteinase or the X-ray crystal struc- ture of the TGEV M pro may be used as a starting point for design anti-SARS drugs. Screening the known proteinase inhibitors may be an appreciated shortcut to discover anti-SARS drugs.",

        "abstract": "Chitinolytic \u03b2-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase is a branch of the GH20 (glycoside hydrolase family 20) \u03b2-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidases that is only distributed in insects and micro-organisms, and is therefore a potential target for the action of insecticides. PUGNAc [O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyransylidene)-amino-N-phenylcarbamate] was initially identified as an inhibitor against GH20 \u03b2-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidases. So far no crystal structure of PUGNAc in complex with any GH20 \u03b2-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase has been reported. We show in the present study that the sensitivities of chitinolytic \u03b2-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidases towards PUGNAc can vary by 100-fold, with the order being OfHex1 (Ostrinia furnacalis \u03b2-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase)<SmCHB (Serratia marcescens chitobiase)<SpHex (Streptomyces plicatus \u03b2-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase). To explain this difference, the crystal structures of wild-type OfHex1 as well as mutant OfHex1(V327G) in complex with PUGNAc were determined at 2.0 \u00c5 (1 \u00c5=0.1 nm) and 2.3 \u00c5 resolutions and aligned with the complex structures of SpHex and SmCHB. The results showed that the sensitivities of these enzymes to PUGNAc were determined by the active pocket size, with OfHex1 having the largest but narrowest entrance, whereas SpHex has the smallest entrance, suitable for holding the inhibitor, and SmCHB has the widest entrance. By widening the size of the active pocket entrance of OfHex1 through replacing the active site Val327 with a glycine residue, the sensitivity of OfHex1 to PUGNAc became similar to that of SmCHB. The structural differences among chitinolytic \u03b2-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidases leading to different sensitivities to PUGNAc may be useful for developing species-specific pesticides and bactericides.",

        "abstract": "A series of new arctigenin and 9-deoxy-arctigenin derivatives bearing different ester and ether side chains at the phenolic hydroxyl positions are designed, synthesized, and evaluated for activating AMPK potency in L6 myoblasts. Initial biological evaluation indicates that some alkyl ester and phenethyl ether arctigenin derivatives display potential activities in AMPK phosphorylation improvement. Further structure-activity relationship analysis shows that arctigenin ester derivatives 3a, 3h and 9-deoxy-arctigenin phenethyl ether derivatives 6a, 6c, 6d activate AMPK more potently than arctigenin. Moreover, the 2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl ether moiety of 6c has been demonstrated as a potential functional group to improve the effect of AMPK phosphorylation. The structural optimization of arctigenin leads to the identification of 6c as a promising lead compound that exhibits excellent activity in AMPK activation.",

Abz/Eddnp was used as the fluorescence donor and quenching pair. The highly fluorescent Abz group was efficiently quenched by energy transfer to the Eddnp group. The fluorescent substrate was specifically hydrolyzed by SARS-Co V 3CLpro between QS with 15-fold increase in fluorescence and the cleavage site was determined by HPLC-MS. The studies on its enzymatic kinetics (Km = 525.5 \u03bcmol/L and Kcat = 1. 29 min-1) elucidate that the synthetic fluorescent peptide substrate is suited to be used as a fluorescent probe in determination of the activity of SARS-Co V 3CLpro and screening assays for its inhibitors.",

In this report, we identified a new metB gene from Helicobacter pylori strain SS1, and the recombinant H. pylori Cystathionine \u03b3-synthase (HpCGS) was successfully cloned, expressed and purified in Escherichia coli system. Enzymatic study of HpCGS indicated that the Km and kcat/Km values against the substrate O-succinyl-l-homoserine (l-OSHS) were 3.02 mM and 98.7 M- 1s-1, respectively. Moreover, four natural products (\u03b1-lapachone, 9-hydroxy-\u03b1-lapachone, Paulownin and Yangambin, Fig. 1) were discovered to demonstrate inhibitory activities against HpCGS with IC50 values of 11 \u00b1 3, 9 \u00b1 1, 19 \u00b1 2 and 27 \u00b1 6 \u03bcM, respectively. All these four inhibitors prevent the binding of l-OSHS to HpCGS in a non-competitive fashion. In vitro antibacterial assays further indicated that these four discovered compounds could highly inhibit the growth of H. pylori and exhibited strong inhibitory specificity against H. pylori related to E. coli. \u00a9 2007 The Japanese Biochemical Society.",

        "abstract": "des-O-methyllasiodiplodin (DML) from Cerbera manghas has shown antagonistic activity against mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Considering the involvement of MR in the insulin tolerance, we attempted to investigate the potential of DML in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology and reporter gene-based assays were used to study protein-small molecule interactions. HepG2 and 3T3-L1 cells were treated with H2O2 (0.2 mmol/L) or aldosterone (10 nmol/L) for 24 h. The expression of MR in the cells was downregulated with siRNA. The anti-inflammatory effect of the compound was evaluated, respectively. db/db mice were administered DML (30 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7d(-1)) for 4 weeks. Serum biochemical parameters and insulin sensitivity were examined. The expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (MCP-1, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) and ROS-related genes (NADPH p47 subunit and transcriptional factor PU.1) in adipose tissues and livers were analyzed using real-time RT-PCR.In HepG2 and 3T3-L1 cells, both H2O2 and aldosterone markedly stimulates the expression of MCP-1, TNF\u03b1, IL-6, p47 and PU.1 genes. Co-treatment with DML (10 \u03bcmol/L) significantly reduced the H2O2- or aldosterone-induced expression of these genes. SPR-based assay confirmed the antagonistic activity of DML against the interaction between SRC-1 and MR-LBD. Furthermore, DML decreased aldosterone-induced MR transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner. Downregulation of MR with siRNA in the cells prevented or significantly attenuated aldosterone-stimulated expression of these genes, whereas DML did no longer affect the expression of these genes except that of IL-6. Oral administration of DML effectively reduced the levels of blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in db/db mice. The treatment also rectified the expression of pro-inflammatory factor and ROS-related genes in db/db mice.DML effectively lowers the blood glucose level in db/db mice possibly via ameliorating the expression of obesity-related pro-inflammatory cytokines, highlighting the potential of the marine natural product as a drug lead for the treatment of metabolic disorders.",

        "abstract": "Colonization of human stomach by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori is a major causative factor for gastrointestinal illnesses and gastric cancer. However, the discovery of anti-H. pylori agents is a difficult task due to lack of mature protein targets. Therefore, identifying new molecular targets for developing new drugs against H. pylori is obviously necessary. In this study, the in-house potential drug target database (PDTD, http://www.dddc.ac.cn/tarfisdock/) was searched by the reverse docking approach using an active natural product (compound 1) discovered by anti-H. pylori screening as a probe. Homology search revealed that, among the 15 candidates discovered by reverse docking, only diaminopimelate decarboxylase (DC) and peptide deformylase (PDF) have homologous proteins in the genome of H. pylori. Enzymatic assay demonstrated compound 1 and its derivative compound 2 are the potent inhibitors against H. pylori PDF (HpPDF) with IC50 values of 10.8 and 1.25 microM, respectively. X-ray crystal structures of HpPDF and the complexes of HpPDF with 1 and 2 were determined for the first time, indicating that these two inhibitors bind well with HpPDF binding pocket. All these results indicate that HpPDF is a potential target for screening new anti-H. pylori agents. In addition, compounds 1 and 2 were predicted to bind to HpPDF with relatively high selectivity, suggesting they can be used as leads for developing new anti-H. pylori agents. The results demonstrated that our strategy, reverse docking in conjunction with bioassay and structural biology, is effective and can be used as a complementary approach of functional genomics and chemical biology in target identification.",

        "abstract": "Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are a family of non-heme iron-containing dioxygenases that catalyze the hydroperoxidation of lipids, containing a cis,cis-1,4-pentadiene structure. A rapid and reliable colorimetric assay for determination of the activity of three human functional lipoxygenase isoforms (5-lipoxygenase, platelet 12-lipoxygenase, and 15-lipoxygenase-1) is developed in this article. In the new assay, LOX-derived lipid hydroperoxides oxidize the ferrous ion (Fe\u00b2\u207a) to the ferric ion (Fe\u00b3\u207a), the latter of which binds with thiocyanate (SCN\u207b) to generate a red ferrithiocyanate (FTC) complex. The absorbance of the FTC complex can be easily measured at 480 nm. Because 5-LOX can be stimulated by many cofactors, the effects of its cofactors (Ca\u00b2\u207a, ATP, dithiothreitol, glutathione, L-\u03b1-phosphatidylcholine, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) on the color development of the FTC complex are also determined. The assay is adaptive for purified LOXs and cell lysates containing active LOXs. We use the new colorimetric assay in a 96-well format to evaluate several well-known LOX inhibitors, the IC\u2085\u2080 values of which are in good agreement with previously reported data. The reliability and reproducibility of the assay make it useful for in vitro screening for inhibitors of LOXs and, therefore, should accelerate drug discovery for clinical application.",

        "title": "The nucleocapsid protein of SARS coronavirus has a high binding affinity to the human cellular heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1.",
        "abstract": "The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS coronavirus (SARS_CoV) is a major structural component of virions, which appears to be a multifunctional protein involved in viral RNA replication and translation. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is related to the pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus and translation regulation in the cytoplasm. In this report, based on the relevant biophysical and biochemical assays, the nucleocapsid protein of SARS_CoV (SARS_N) was discovered to exhibit high binding affinity to human hnRNP A1. GST pull-down results clearly demonstrated that SARS_N protein could directly and specifically bind to human hnRNP A1 in vitro. Yeast two-hybrid assays further indicated in vivo that such binding relates to the fragment (aa 161-210) of SARS_N and the Gly-rich domain (aa 203-320) of hnRNP A1. Moreover, kinetic analyses by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology revealed that SARS_N protein has a specific binding affinity against human hnRNP A1 with K(D) at 0.35 +/- 0.02 microM (k(on) = 5.83 +/- 0.42 x 10(3) M(-1)s(-1) and k(off) = 2.06 +/- 0.12 x 10(-3)s(-1)). It is suggested that both SARS_N and hnRNP A1 proteins are possibly within the SARS_CoV replication/transcription complex and SARS_N/human hnRNP A1 interaction might function in the regulation of SARS_CoV RNA synthesis. In addition, the determined results showed that SARS_N protein has only one binding domain for interacting with human hnRNP A1, which is different from the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) binding case where the nucleocapsid protein of MHV (MHV_N) was found to have two binding domains involved in the MHV_N/hnRNP A1 interaction, thereby suggesting that SARS_N protein might carry out a different binding mode to bind to human hnRNP A1 for its further function performance in comparison with MHV_N.",

The results showed that SARS_NP existed in vitro as oligomer, more probably dimer, as the basic functional unit. This protein shows its maximum conformational stability near pH 9.0, and it seems that its oligomer dissociation and protein unfolding occur simultaneously. Thermal-induced unfolding for SARS_NP was totally irreversible. Both the thermal and chemical denaturant-induced denaturation analyses showed that oligomeric SARS_NP unfolds and refolds through a two-state model, and the electrostatic interactions among the charge groups of SARS_NP made a significant contribution to its conformational stability.",

        "abstract": "AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) as a key controller in the regulation of whole-body energy homeostasis, plays an important role in protecting the body from metabolic diseases. Recently, improved glucose, lipid utility and increased insulin sensitivity were observed on several diabetic rodent models treated with crude mogrosides isolated from the fruit of Siraitia grosvenorii Swingle, but the precise active compounds responsible for the anti-diabetic activity of this plant have not been clearly identified. In our current work, acid hydrolysis of crude mogrosides provided five new cucurbitane triterpenoids (1-4, 8), along with three known ones (5-7). The main aglycone mogrol (7) and compounds 4 and 8 were found to be potent AMPK activators in the HepG2 cell line. This result suggested AMPK activation by the mogroside aglycones 7 and 8 was proved to contribute at least partially to the anti-hyperglycemic and anti-lipidemic properties in vivo of S. grosvenorii.",

        "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori is a gram-negative pathogenic bacterium, which is associated with peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. It is urgent to discover novel drug targets for appropriate antimicrobial agents against this human pathogen. In bacteria, peptide deformylase (PDF) catalyzes the removal of a formyl group from the N-termini of nascent polypeptides. Due to its essentiality and absence in mammalian cells, PDF has been considered as an attractive target for the discovery of novel antibiotics. In this work, a new PDF gene (def) from H. pylori strain SS1 was cloned, expressed, and purified in Escherichia coli system. Sequence alignment shows that H. pylori PDF (HpPDF) shares about 40% identity to E. coli PDF (EcPDF). The enzymatic properties of HpPDF demonstrate its relatively high activity toward formyl-Met-Ala-Ser, with K(cat) of 3.4s(-1), K(m) of 1.7 mM, and K(cat) / K(m) of 2000M(-1)s(-1). HpPDF enzyme appears to be fully active at pH between 8.0 and 9.0, and temperature 50 degrees C. The enzyme activity of Co(2+)-containing HpPDF is apparently higher than that of Zn(2+)-containing HpPDF. This present work thereby supplies a potential platform that facilitates the discovery of novel HpPDF inhibitors and further of possible antimicrobial agents against H. pylori.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by extracellular deposit of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) and accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (PGF2\u03b1) is one of the major metabolites of arachidonic acid (AA), and plays essential roles in a series of key physiological processes like luteolysis and parturition. Additionally, PGF2\u03b1 is also involved in the regulation of chronic and acute inflammation processes. Recent clinical studies have revealed the high content of PGF2\u03b1 metabolite, 15-keto-dihydro-PGF2\u03b1 in AD patients, implying the activation of in vivo PGF2\u03b1 biosynthesis. However, the mechanism underlying the involvement of PGF2\u03b1 in the progression of AD still remains unclear. Here we discovered that PGF2\u03b1 selectively antagonized LXR (liver X receptors)/RXR (retinoid X receptor \u03b1) and RXR/RXR dimers. Cell based assays indicated that PGF2\u03b1 effectively antagonized the activation of LXR agonist (t0901317) on A\u03b2 clearance via inhibiting apolipoprotein E (apoE) expression, and cell apoptosis alleviation by accelerating inflammatory response to A\u03b2 or Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in microglia. Therefore, our current findings have addressed the potential association of PGF2\u03b1 with AD progression, and highlighted that inhibition of PGF2\u03b1 biosynthesis might be a useful therapeutic strategy against AD.",

        "abstract": "The 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is one of the most promising targets for anti-SARS-CoV drugs due to its crucial role in the viral life cycle. In this study, a database containing structural information of more than 8,000 existing drugs was virtually screened by a docking approach to identify potential binding molecules of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. As a target for screening, both a homology model and the crystallographic structure of the binding pocket of the enzyme were used. Cinanserin (SQ 10,643), a well-characterized serotonin antagonist that has undergone preliminary clinical testing in humans in the 1960s, showed a high score in the screening and was chosen for further experimental evaluation. Binding of both cinanserin and its hydrochloride to bacterially expressed 3CLpro of SARS-CoV and the related human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) was demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance technology. The catalytic activity of both enzymes was inhibited with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 5 microM, as tested with a fluorogenic substrate. The antiviral activity of cinanserin was further evaluated in tissue culture assays, namely, a replicon system based on HCoV-229E and quantitative test assays with infectious SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E. All assays revealed a strong inhibition of coronavirus replication at nontoxic drug concentrations. The level of virus RNA and infectious particles was reduced by up to 4 log units, with IC50 values ranging from 19 to 34 microM. These findings demonstrate that the old drug cinanserin is an inhibitor of SARS-CoV replication, acting most likely via inhibition of the 3CL proteinase.",

        "abstract": "Nuclear receptors retinoic X receptor \u03b1 (RXR\u03b1) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) function potently in metabolic diseases, and are both important targets for anti-diabetic drugs. Coactivation of RXR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 is believed to synergize their effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. Here we identify the natural product magnolol as a dual agonist targeting both RXR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3. Magnolol was previously reported to enhance adipocyte differentiation and glucose uptake, ameliorate blood glucose level and prevent development of diabetic nephropathy. Although magnolol can bind and activate both of these two nuclear receptors, the transactivation assays indicate that magnolol exhibits biased agonism on the transcription of PPAR-response element (PPRE) mediated by RXR\u03b1:PPAR\u03b3 heterodimer, instead of RXR-response element (RXRE) mediated by RXR\u03b1:RXR\u03b1 homodimer. To further elucidate the molecular basis for magnolol agonism, we determine both the co-crystal structures of RXR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 ligand-binding domains (LBDs) with magnolol. Structural analyses reveal that magnolol adopts its two 5-allyl-2-hydroxyphenyl moieties occupying the acidic and hydrophobic cavities of RXR\u03b1 L-shaped ligand-binding pocket, respectively. While, two magnolol molecules cooperatively accommodate into PPAR\u03b3 Y-shaped ligand-binding pocket. Based on these two complex structures, the key interactions for magnolol activating RXR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 are determined. As the first report on the dual agonist targeting RXR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 with receptor-ligand complex structures, our results are thus expected to help inspect the potential pharmacological mechanism for magnolol functions, and supply useful hits for nuclear receptor multi-target ligand design.",

        "abstract": "\u03b2-Hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein dehydratase (FabZ) is an important enzyme for the elongation cycles of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids biosyntheses in the type II fatty acid biosynthesis system (FAS II) pathway. FabZ has been an essential target for the discovery of compounds effective against pathogenic microbes. In this work, to characterize the catalytic and inhibitory mechanisms of FabZ, the crystal structures of the FabZ of Helicobacter pylori (HpFabZ) and its complexes with two newly discovered inhibitors have been solved. Different from the structures of other bacterial FabZs, HpFabZ contains an extra short two-turn \u03b1-helix (\u03b14) between \u03b13 and \u03b23, which plays an important role in shaping the substrate-binding tunnel. Residue Tyr-100 at the entrance of the tunnel adopts either an open or closed conformation in the crystal structure. The crystal structural characterization, the binding affinity determination, and the enzymatic activity assay of the HpFabZ mutant (Y100A) confirm the importance of Tyr-100 in catalytic activity and substrate binding. Residue Phe-83 at the exit tunnel was also refined in two alternative conformations, leading the tunnel to form an L-shape and U-shape. All these data thus contributed much to understanding the catalytic mechanism of HpFabZ. In addition, the co-crystal structures of HpFabZ with its inhibitors have suggested that the enzymatic activity of HpFabZ could be inhibited either by occupying the entrance of the tunnel or plugging the tunnel to prevent the substrate from accessing the active site. Our study has provided some insights into the catalytic and inhibitory mechanisms of FabZ, thus facilitating antibacterial agent development. \u00a9 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Resistance of malaria parasites has quickly developed to almost all used antimalarial drugs. Accordingly, the discovery of new effective drugs to counter the spread of malaria parasites that are resistant to existing agents, especially acting on multi-targets, is an urgent need. The cysteine protease falcipain-2 (FP-2) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) play crucial roles in the Plasmodium life cycle. In this study, a series of first-gereration small molecular dual inhibitor of FP-2 and DHFR have been designed and synthesized based on the lead compound 1, which was randomly identified by screening FP-2 inhibitors in our laboratory. Six compounds (2f-g, 2j, and 2m-o) showed improved dual inhibitory activities against FP-2 (IC(50)=2.7-13.2\u03bcM) and DHFR (IC(50)=1.8-19.8\u03bcM), and the inhibitory capability of compound 2o against FP-2 and DHFR were increased \u223c8 and \u223c6 times than that of compound 1, respectively. Moreover, compound 2o exhibited moderate in vivo antimalarial activity in a dose dependent fashion, its safety and survival rate were slightly better than that of positive drug. The preliminary SAR was obtained, meanwhile, molecular modeling result provided the key structural information to maintain the dual inhibitory activity, and was helpful for future dual inhibitors design.",

Although the stringent control of blood pressure is known to be beneficial in reducing the cardiovascular mortality of T2DM patients, drugs with both anti-hypertensive and anti-hyperglycemic effects are seldom reported. The traditional Chinese medicine danshen has long been used for lowering both blood pressure and blood glucose in T2DM patients, shedding lights on the development of such medication. However, the molecular mechanism and active component remain unclear. Here, we report that the lipophilic component, 15,16-dihydrotanshinone I (DHTH) from danshen potently antagonized both mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors, and efficiently inhibited the expression of their target genes like Na(+)/K(+) ATPase, glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). In addition, DHTH increased AMPKalpha phosphorylation and regulated its downstream pathways, including increasing acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation, inhibiting transducer of regulated CREB activity 2 (TORC2) translocation and promoting glucose uptake. Such discovered multi-target effects of DHTH are expected to have provided additional understandings on the molecular basis of the therapeutic effects of danshen against the metabolic syndrome.",

        "abstract": "Zn(2+) directly participates in catalysis of histone deacetylase (HDAC) Classes I, II, IV enzymes while its role in HDAC Class III activity is not well established. Herein we investigated the effects of Zn(2+) on the deacetylase activity of sirtuin 1 (silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1, SIRT1). We found that the inherent Zn(2+) at the zinc-finger motif of SIRT1 is essential for the structural integrity and the deacetylase activity of SIRT1, whereas the exogenous Zn(2+) strongly inhibits the deacetylase activity with an IC(50) of 0.82muM for Zn(Gly)(2). SIRT1 activity suppressed by the exogenous Zn(2+) can be fully recovered by the metal chelator EDTA but not by the activator resveratrol. We also identified Zn(2+) as a noncompetitive inhibitor for the substrates of NAD(+) and the acetyl peptide P53-AMC. The 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) fluorescence titration experiments and site-directed mutagenesis study suggested that the exogenous Zn(2+) binds to SIRT1 but not at the zinc-finger motif. These results indicate that Zn(2+) plays a dual role in SIRT1 activity. Inherent Zn(2+) at the zinc-finger motif is structurally related and essential for SIRT1 activity. On the other hand, Zn(2+) may also bind to another site different from the zinc-finger motif or the binding sites for the substrates or resveratrol and act as a potent inhibitor of SIRT1.",

        "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) is a nuclear transcription factor which is involved in many diseases, such as diabetes, inflammation, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and cancer. Recently, there are many reports showing that PPAR\u03b3 agonists have preclinical and clinical anticancer activity, with relatively few reports on anticancer effects of PPAR\u03b3 antagonists. From our compound library, a novel 3-thiazolinone-modified benzoic acid derivative HL005 is found as PPAR\u03b3 selective ligand through SPR analysis (K(D)=0.21 \u03bcM), yeast two-hybrid results suggest that HL005 antagonize the potent PPAR\u03b3 agonist rosiglitazone-induced recruitment of the coactivator for PPAR\u03b3 (IC(50)=7.97 \u03bcM). Different from the most reported PPAR\u03b3 antagonist, HL005 can inhibit the proliferation of MCF-7 cell line in a concentration-dependent manner and induce cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, other than interference with cell adhesion. In order to study the binding mode of this compound, three derivatives are synthesized to get more detail about the structure-activity relationship, molecular docking and the NMR spectra indicate that similar to most PPAR\u03b3 ligand, the carboxylic acid group is an important moiety for HL005 and contributes strong interaction with PPAR\u03b3.",

A novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been recently identified as the etiological agent responsible for the infectious SARS disease. Based on extensively scientific cooperation and almost two-year's studies, remarkable achievements have been made in the understanding of the phylogenetic property and the genome organization of SARS-CoV, as well as the detailed characters of the major proteins involved in SARS-CoV life cycle. In this review, we would like to summarize the substantial scientific progress that has been made towards the structural and functional aspects of SARS-CoV associated key proteins. The progress focused on the corresponding key proteins' structure-based drug and vaccine developments has been also highlighted. The concerted and cooperative response for the treatment of the SARS disease has been proved to be a triumph of global public health and provides a new paradigm for the detection and control of future emerging infectious disease threats.",

In this paper, two equations have been derived to solve\n this problem. These two equations are independent of the total concentration or initial degree of saturation of receptor and\n the activity of the competitive molecule. Through nonlinear fitting against these two equations, K\n \n d\n  value of a probe can be obtained by binding assay, and K\n \n i\n  value of a ligand can be obtained by competitive assay. Moreover, only the total concentrations of receptor([R]t), ligand([L]t) and probe([P]t) are required for the data fitting. In this work, K\n \n i\n  values of some typical ligands of PPAR\u03b3 were successfully determined by use of our equations, among which the K\n \n i\n  value of PPAR\u03b3-LY171883 was reported for the first time.",

        "abstract": "Spike protein is one of the major structural proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus. It is essential for the interaction of the virons with host cell receptors and subsequent fusion of the viral envelop with host cell membrane to allow infection. Some spike proteins of coronavirus, such as MHV, HCoV-OC43, AIBV and BcoV, are proteolytically cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2. In contrast, TGV, FIPV and HCoV-229E are not. Many studies have shown that the cleavage of spike protein seriously affects its function. In order to investigate the maturation and proteolytic processing of the S protein of SARS CoV, we generated S1 and S2 subunit specific antibodies (Abs) as well as N, E and 3CL protein-specific Abs. Our results showed that the antibodies could efficiently and specifically bind to their corresponding proteins from E.coli expressed or lysate of SARS-CoV infected Vero-E6 cells by Western blot analysis. Furthermore, the anti-S1 and S2 Abs were proved to be capable of binding to SARS CoV under electron microscope observation. When S2 Ab was used to perform immune precipitation with lysate of SARS-CoV infected cells, a cleaved S2 fragment was detected with S2-specific mAb by Western blot analysis. The data demonstrated that the cleavage of S protein was observed in the lysate, indicating that proteolytic processing of S protein is present in host cells.",

        "abstract": "GLUT4, the main insulin-responsive glucose transporter, plays a critical role in maintaining systemic glucose homeostasis and is subject to complicated metabolic regulation. GLUT4 expression disorder might cause insulin resistance, and over-expression of GLUT4 has been confirmed to ameliorate diabetes. Here, we reported that farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and its agonist chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) could induce GLUT4 transcription in 3T3-L1 and HepG2 cells. Furthermore, CDCA could increase the GLUT4 protein amount in C57BL/6J mice sex-dependently. The following progressive 5'-deletion analysis and site-mutation investigation further suggested that FXR could induce GLUT4 expression through FXR response element (FXRE) in the GLUT4 promoter. EMSA and knock-down of retinoid X receptor (RXR) indicated that FXR binds to the GLUT4-FXRE as a monomer and RXR does not participate in the FXR stimulation of GLUT4 expression. In addition, we demonstrated that FXR does not interfere with insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation to plasma membrane. All these data thereby implied that FXR is a new transcription factor of GLUT4, further elucidating the potential role for FXR in glucose metabolism.",

The structure of compound 1a (G3335, Fig. 1), a novel class of PPARgamma antagonist, is entirely different from that of other reported PPARgamma antagonists. A series of 35 novel analogues (1b-l, 9a-d, 13a-t) were designed, synthesized and evaluated against the agonistic effects exerted by rosiglitazone. These results indicated that most functional groups of 1a were conserved, and six new compounds (1b, 1c, and 9a-d) exhibited strong PPARgamma antagonistic activities (IC(50) values of 5.2-25.8 microM) against 10 microM rosiglitazone in the promotion of the PPARgamma-LBD-CBP (ligand-binding domain and cAMP-response-element binding protein) interaction as investigated by yeast two-hybrid technology based assay. Molecular modeling studies for compounds 1a-d, 1h, 9c-d, and 13a were also presented.",

The currently developed steered molecular dynamics (SMD) is a complementary approach to experimental techniques\n in investigating the biochemical processes occurring at microsecond or second time scale, thus SMD may provide dynamical and\n kinetic processes of ligand-receptor binding and unbinding, which cannot be accessed by the experimental methods. In this\n article, the methodology of SMD is described, and the applications of SMD simulations for obtaining dynamic insights into\n protein-ligand interactions are illustrated through two of our own examples.

        "abstract": "AIM: Based on the structural analysis to reveal the mechanism of ligand binding to \u03b2-secretase and the specificity of each binding sub-site. METHODS: Molecular dynamics was used to simulate on the ligand free \u03b2-secretase and ligand bound \u03b2-secretase. The trajectories were analyzed using the essential dynamics, and the significant confor- mational change was illustrated employing the DynDom program. RESULTS: The essential dynamics and DynDom analyses clearly showed that the \u03b2-secretase experienced a large conformational change upon the substrate o r inhibitor binding. The flap structure adopted a swing motion, gradually covering the active site to facilitate the ligand binding process. Residues Ser86 and Ile87 served as the hinge point. Inhibitor-enzyme interaction analysis revealed that residues at P2, P1, and P1' positions of the inhibitor were very important for the binding, and residues at P2' and P3' positions may be modified to improve the binding specificity. S3 subsite of the enzyme still had space to modify the inhibitors in increasing the binding affinity. CONCLUSION: The information presented here is valuable and could be used to identify small molecular inhibitors of \u03b2-secretase.",

        "abstract": "Improvement of glucose and lipid metabolic dysfunctions is a potent therapeutic strategy against type 2 diabetes mellitus, and identifying new functions for existing drugs may help accelerate the speed of new drug development. Here, we report that latanoprost, a clinical drug for treating primary open-angle glaucoma and intraocular hypertension, effectively ameliorated glucose and lipid disorders in two mouse models of type 2 diabetes. In addition, the glucose-lowering mechanisms of latanoprost were intensively investigated.A binding-affinity assay and enzymatic tests were used to determine the targets of latanoprost. Cell-based assays on 3T3-L1 adipocytes and C2C12 myotubes and animal model-based assays with db/db and ob/ob mice were further performed to clarify the mechanisms underlying latanoprost-regulated glucose and lipid metabolism.Latanoprost functioned as both an indirect activator of AMP-activated protein kinase and a selective retinoid X receptor \u03b1 (RXR\u03b1) antagonist able to selectively antagonise the transcription of a RXR\u03b1/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 heterodimer. It promoted glucose uptake, inhibited pre-adipocyte differentiation and regulated the main genes responsible for glucose and lipid metabolism, including Fas, Scd1, Perilipin (also known as Plin1), Lpl and Pdk4. Chronic administration of latanoprost in mice potently decreased the levels of fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, fructosamine (FMN), NEFA and total cholesterol, and effectively improved glucose tolerance and glucose/lipid metabolism-related genes in vivo.Our studies demonstrate that the existing eye drug latanoprost is both an indirect activator of AMP-activated protein kinase and a selective RXR\u03b1 antagonist. Latanoprost effectively ameliorated glucose and lipid disorders in diabetic mice, which strongly highlights the potential of latanoprost in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

This study discovered a new class of thieno[2,3-b]pyridine derivatives as hepatic gluconeogenesis inhibitors. First, a hit compound (DMT: IC\u202f=\u202f33.8\u202f\u03bcM) characterized by a thienopyridine core was identified in a cell-based screening of our privileged small molecule library. Structure activity relationships (SARs) study showed that replaced the CF in the thienopyridine core could improve the potency and led to the discovery of 8e (IC\u202f=\u202f16.8\u202f\u03bcM) and 9d (IC\u202f=\u202f12.3\u202f\u03bcM) with potent inhibition of hepatic glucose production and good drug-like properties. Furthermore, the mechanism of 8e for the inhibition of hepatic glucose production was also identified, which could be effective through the reductive expression of the mRNA transcription level of gluconeogenic genes, including glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Additionally, 8e could also reduce the fasting blood glucose and improve the oral glucose tolerance and pyruvate tolerance in db/db mice. The optimization of this class of derivatives had provided us a start point to develop new anti-hepatic gluconeogenesis agents.",

Thus, targeting ATF6\u03b1 activation has been proposed to be a potential strategy for anti-T2DM drug discovery. Here, we determined that small molecule 2-[5-[1-(4-chlorophenoxy)ethyl]-4-phenyl-4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl]sulfanyl-N-(1,5-dimethyl-3-oxo-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)acetamide (TSPA) functioned as an ATF6\u03b1 translocation inducer effectively promoting ATF6\u03b1 translocation into nucleus and ameliorating glucose homeostasis on db/db mice. TSPA promoted ATF6\u03b1 translocation into nucleus without incresing C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) expression. TSPA restored the tunicamycin (TM)-stimulated insulin receptor (IR) desensitization through ATF6\u03b1 activation, inhibited gluconeogenesis and efficiently improved glucose homeostasis on db/db mice. Furthermore, TSPA protected insulin pathway involving p38/X-box binding protein 1s (Xbp1s)/ER chaperones signaling pathway. Our current study has determined that ATF6\u03b1 was a promising therapeutic target and also highlighted the potential of TSPA in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).",

Given the neuronal protection of vincamine and the potency of \u03b2-cell amelioration in treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), we investigated the potential of vincamine in protecting \u03b2-cells and ameliorating glucose homeostasis in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, we found that vincamine could protect INS-832/13 cells function by regulating G-protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40)/cAMP/Ca2+/IRS2/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, while increase glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) via modulating GPR40/cAMP/Ca2+/CaMKII pathway, which reveals a novel mechanism underlying GPR40-mediated cell protection and GSIS in INS-832/13 cells. Moreover, administration of vincamine effectively ameliorated glucose homeostasis in either HFD/STZ or db/db type 2 diabetic mice. To our knowledge, our current work might be the first report on vincamine targeting GPR40 and its potential in the treatment of T2DM.",

        "title": "L655,240, acting as a competitive BACE1 inhibitor, efficiently decreases |[beta]|-amyloid peptide production in HEK293-APPswe cells",
        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by cognitive impairment and memory dysfunction. The elderly are at high risk for developing AD, especially those aged 65 years and older1. The incidence of AD is expected to rise as the aging population grows and to create an increasingly heavy burden for families and society. To date, several therapeutic strategies have been identified to treat AD. For example, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, antihypertensive drugs and anti-inflammatory drugs2 have been reported to be effective in combating AD. However, only AChEIs (eg, donepezil, galantamine, tacrine and rivastigmine)3 and one NMDA antagonist (memantine)4 have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat AD. These drugs also have several limitations, including short half-lives, considerable side effects and high costs. Some antihypertensive drugs, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors5, calcium channel blockers6 and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)7, have also been shown to reduce mental decline in AD patients or to decrease the risk of acquiring AD. However, they have not been used for AD treatment. Because secretase [\u03b2-secretase (beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1, BACE1) and \u03b3-secretase] inhibitors can reduce A\u03b2 production and no secretase inhibitors are currently marketed to treat AD, the development of BACE1 inhibitors offers a potentially powerful clinical option for AD therapy. The factors that have most commonly been suggested to cause AD are intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of a hyperphosphorylated form of the microtubule-associated protein tau and extracellular neuritic plaques aggregated by \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptides (A\u03b240 and A\u03b242)8,9. The membrane-spanning amyloid precursor protein (APP) is sequentially cleaved into A\u03b2 by BACE1 and \u03b3-secretase. BACE1 initially cleaves APP at the N-terminus, yielding the soluble APP\u03b2 (sAPP\u03b2) and the C-terminal, membrane-bound stub of 99 amino acids (C99). C99 is further cleaved by \u03b3-secretase to generate A\u03b2 (A\u03b240 and A\u03b242) and the amyloid intracellular domain (AICD)1,10. As mentioned, both BACE1 and \u03b3-secretase play essential roles in A\u03b2 production. Previous results have indicated that knocking out the BACE1 gene abrogates pathogenic A\u03b2 production in mice and that this gene ablation rescues memory deficits and cholinergic dysfunction in APP transgenic mice11,12,13. Similarly, mice with a BACE1 gene deletion remain healthy, fertile and viable, except for partial hypomyelination at the juvenile development stage14,15,16. However, previous reports have revealed that \u03b3-secretase can cleave not only APP but also Notch (an essential protein for proper formation of the axial skeleton, normal neurogenesis and neuronal survival in the embryo)17,18,19, and the absence of the catalytic subunits of \u03b3-secretase (presenilin 1 and 2) is known to cause embryonic lethality due to the disruption of Notch. Therefore, BACE1 has been suggested to be a more attractive therapeutic target than \u03b3-secretase for the treatment or prevention of AD. Because BACE1 is a rate-limiting enzyme during A\u03b2 secretion, many research groups have focused on the identification of BACE1 inhibitors. The first class of BACE1 inhibitors was designed based on the specificity of BACE1 cleavage of APP, an example of which is the first-generation inhibitor OM99-2, an eight-residue peptide20. Although the bulky structure of this inhibitor has prevented its application in vivo, the BACE1/OM99-2 co-crystal structure has provided vivid molecular insight into the interaction of BACE1 with the ligand, paving the way for design of later BACE1 inhibitors20. Subsequently, some penta-peptidic BACE1 inhibitors, such as KMI-429, KMI-570 and KMI-684 were reported to significantly decrease A\u03b2 production when directly injected into the hippocampus of APP transgenic mice21,22. In addition to these compounds designed based on the substrate, small molecular non-peptidic compounds, including GSK18890923, compound 1124 and CTS-2116625, were reported to be highly effective in reducing A\u03b2 production when administered orally to APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Of these substrate-based BACE1 inhibitors, CTS-21166 has passed Phase 1 clinical trials25. Another class of non-peptidic BACE1 inhibitors were obtained from a high-throughput screening (HTS) technology-based assay targeting chemical libraries. Typical examples of this class of inhibitors include compounds 10d26, 3a27, and TAK-07028, which are orally active and show good selectivity over other aspartic proteases. The third class of BACE1 inhibitors includes natural products, such as catechins obtained from Green tea29, lavandulyl flavanones extracted from Sophora flavescens30, resveratrol obtained from Vitis vinifera31 and TDC obtained from Glycyrrhiza glabra32. Currently, significant research efforts have been undertaken to find small molecule BACE1 inhibitors with satisfactory pharmacological properties. However, due to the difficulty in developing drugs that can efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier and reach appropriate therapeutic concentrations in the cerebral parenchyma without causing other side effects, no BACE1 inhibitor has yet been marketed to treat AD, although some inhibitors have passed Phase 1 clinical trials. Therefore, the discovery of new BACE 1 inhibitors remains highly significant. In the current study, we identified a new type of BACE1 inhibitor, L655,240 (Figure 1). L655,240 was previously reported to be a potent, orally active thromboxane/prostaglandin endoperoxide antagonist33, which significantly attenuated Sephadex-induced bronchial hyper-responsiveness34 and protected against reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation and early (Phase 1a) ischemia-induced arrhythmias35. Here, we report a novel biological role for L655,240 as a potential BACE1 inhibitor. Our work provides novel structural information for the development of potential AD drug lead compounds in the future. To determine the inhibitory type, double-reciprocal (Lineweaver-Burk) plot analysis was performed using a series of concentrations of L655,240 (final concentrations of 0, 2, and 5 \u03bcmol/L) and of substrate (final concentrations of 0, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, and 1000 nmol/L). Substrate was added to BACE1 mixed with vehicle or L655,240 to start the kinetic reaction, and the fluorescence intensity was measured immediately at Ex/Em=535 nm/585 nm. Data were recorded continuously every 1 min for 90 min. Finally, the initial velocity of the enzyme reaction was obtained by determining the slope of the linear portion of the data plot. To evaluate the inhibitory effect of L655,240 on BACE1 activity in cells, a series of concentrations of L655,240 were incubated with cultured cells for 24 h until cells reached confluence in six-well plates. After incubation, the cultures were removed, and the cells were washed with ice cold PBS. Next, 150 \u03bcL of RIPA buffer containing 1% (v/v) complete protease inhibitor cocktail was added, and the samples were incubated for 30 min on ice. The samples were finally centrifuged at 20 000\u00d7g at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was collected and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until later use. Total protein levels were determined using the BCA Protein Assay Reagent kit. The BACE1 activity of the cell lysates was assayed according to the methods described above. To quantify intracellular A\u03b240, A\u03b242, and sAPP\u03b2 levels in cells, the cells were lysed as described above. To detect the contents of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 in the cell lysates, the samples were diluted 1:2 in the standard dilution buffer from the human A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 kits, respectively. For sAPP\u03b2 quantitation, the samples were diluted 1:10 in the standard dilution buffer from the human sAPP\u03b2 ELISA kit. PCR reaction cycles were performed as previously described using the following conditions: 95 \u00b0C for 5 s, 58 \u00b0C for 30 s and 72 \u00b0C for 20 s39. The SPR results clearly showed that L655,240 could directly bind to BACE1 in a concentration-dependent manner. The dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) was calculated to be 17.9\u00b10.72 \u03bcmol/L (Figure 2E). Finally, to exclude the possibility that the decreased levels of sAPP\u03b2, A\u03b240, or A\u03b242 were caused by L655,240 induction of cell toxicity, MTT assays were conducted to evaluate cell viability. The results clearly showed that even high concentrations of L655,240 up to 50 \u03bcmol/L had no effect on cell viability (Figure 4F). Because \u03b3-secretase also contributes to A\u03b2 production1, we next investigated the potential effects of L655,240 on \u03b3-secretase activity. As expected, L655,240 did not alter cleavage of Notch (Figure 5B), another important \u03b3-secretase substrate40 that is an important receptor for neuronal development41. In addition, APP can be processed along two major pathways, the \u03b1-secretase pathway and the \u03b2-secretase pathway, which competitively cleave the same APP substrate. In the \u03b1-secretase pathway, APP is thought to be processed at the \u201c\u03b1-site\u201d by the ADAM family members ADAM17 and ADAM1042. Here, we also investigated the effects of L655,240 on ADAM17 activity and ADAM10 expression. Our results showed that L655,240 did not affect ADAM17 activity (Figure 5C) or ADAM10 expression (Figure 5B). The Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis for AD has dominated the research field in both academia and the pharmaceutical industry since A\u03b2 was first identified as the major component of amyloid plaques in 198445. The central tenet of this hypothesis is that the mismetabolism of APP is the initiating event in AD pathogenesis and subsequently leads to excessive production and deposition of A\u03b2, which is considered to be the root cause of AD46,47. Formation of amyloid plaques instigates further pathological events, including potential inflammatory responses, neurofibrillary tangles, disruption of synaptic connections and neuronal death, which finally results in dementia48. A\u03b2 is produced by sequential proteolysis of APP by BACE1 and \u03b3-secretase. Since BACE1 is considered to be the rate-limiting enzyme for this process, the development of BACE1 inhibitors is an attractive approach to decrease A\u03b2 production and deposition. However, to date, no BACE1 inhibitor has been used clinically, and the discovery of a novel BACE1 inhibitor is therefore highly significant. Previous studies have shown that the active site of BACE1 is quite open and large20. Therefore, it is challenging to find potent and selective, drug-like small molecular BACE1 inhibitors. In the current study, we successfully identified a novel BACE1 inhibitor, L655,240, with a low molecular weight (373.9 Da) that exhibited good selectivity against other aspartic proteases and displayed key characteristics of a BACE1 inhibitor including successful inhibition of A\u03b2 and APP\u03b2 production in cell-based assays. L655,240 has previously been reported to be a potent, orally active thromboxane antagonist that has significant effects on thromboxane receptor-mediated kidney disease and cardiovascular disease33,35. In this work, we reported for the first time that L655,240 could competitively inhibit recombinant human BACE1 (Figure 2A) in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2B\u20132C). In addition, the affinity of L655,240 binding to BACE1 was evaluated by the SPR technology-based assay (Figure 2E). Because BACE1 is a member of a pepsin family of aspartic proteases49,50 and is a type I transmembrane protein, the selectivity of L655,240 toward other aspartic proteases members was also investigated. We tested the effects of L655,240 on the activity of recombinant renin and of cathepsin D derived from human liver. As expected, L655,240 failed to affect the activities of either renin or cathepsin D (Figure 3A\u20133B). To further confirm the biological functions of L655,240 in cells, we quantitated the levels of sAPP\u03b2, which is the direct product of BACE1 cleavage of APP, in HEK293-APPswe cells. As expected, L655,240 dramatically decreased sAPP\u03b2 production (Figure 4C and 4E). Subsequently, we also measured the levels of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 in cells and found that L655,240 also effectively reduced A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 production (Figure 4A, 4B and 4D). Moreover, our results further indicated that L655,240 inhibited BACE1 activity in HEK293-APPswe cells (Figure 5A) without affecting mature APP and BACE1 protein levels (Figure 6A\u20136B). This finding confirmed that the reductions in sAPP\u03b2, A\u03b240, and A\u03b242 levels occurred through inhibition of BACE1 activity. Because both \u03b1-secretase and \u03b3-secretase can affect A\u03b2 production, we next investigated the potential effects of L655,240 on these two secretases through analysis of \u03b1-secretase activity and Notch protein levels (the substrate of \u03b3-secretase). As expected, L655,240 did not affect \u03b1-secretase activity or Notch protein levels (Figure 5B\u20135C). Therefore, our results further indicated that the decreases in sAPP\u03b2, A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 production by L655,240 were mediated through inhibition of BACE1 activity. As indicated, L655,240 is an ideal BACE1 inhibitor with a small molecular size, potent BACE1 inhibitory action and good selectivity. Therefore, L655,240 is a potential candidate for a drug lead compound aganist AD. However, to further confirm L655,240 as a potential lead compound for the treatment of AD, more work is needed, including investigation of L655,240 permeability through the blood brain barrier and experiments in animal models to assess the effects of L655,240 on memory impairment, both of which are beyond the scope of the current study. In summary, our current findings demonstrate that L655,240 can effectively decrease A\u03b240, A\u03b242, and APP\u03b2 production by directly inhibiting BACE1 activity. Our work has therefore provided structural information for the discovery of the drug lead compound aganist AD in the future.

        "title": "7-Chloroarctinone-b as a new selective PPAR|[gamma]| antagonist potently blocks adipocyte differentiation",
        "abstract": "The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) belong to a superfamily of nuclear hormone receptor and function as heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to regulate the transcription of their target genes via binding to specific peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPRE)1. There are three different PPAR genes that encode four distinct proteins: PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b4, PPAR\u03b31, and PPAR\u03b322, 3. Among them, PPAR\u03b3 is expressed at highest levels in adipose tissue and lower levels in several other tissues. It plays a key role in many metabolic processes, including insulin sensitivity and adipocyte differentiation4, 5. PPAR\u03b3 can be activated by arachidonic acid-metabolites6, 7, 8 and fatty acid-derived components9. Currently, obesity is considered as the most common metabolic disease in developed nations. In 2003\u20132006, the US body mass index growth charts showed that 11.3% of US children and adolescents aged 2 through 19 years old were at or above the 97th percentile, and 31.9% were at or above the 85th percentile10. These types of statistics provide urgent impetus for the development of efficient strategies focused onto reducing the obesity epidemic. PPAR\u03b3 is one of the important therapeutic targets against obesity. Adipocyte differentiation appears to be controlled by two major factors or groups of factors: PPAR\u03b3 and the C/EBPs. PPAR\u03b3 is a component of the adipogenic transcription factor ARF611. C/EBP\u03b1 promotes the adipogenic program, while expression and activation of PPAR\u03b3 efficiently induce adipogenesis12, thereby confirming that PPAR\u03b3 and the C/EBPs play important roles in terminal adipocyte differentiation13. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), a class of insulin-sensitizing agents, bind to and activate PPAR\u03b3. However, an unwanted side effect of TZD treatment is modest weight gain partly caused by increased adipogenesis and the influx of fatty acids into adipose tissue. It has been revealed that the antagonist or partial agonist of PPAR\u03b3 might demonstrate promising applications in the discovery of novel anti-diabetic agents that may retain efficacious insulin sensitizing properties and minimize the potential side effects. For example, the published antagonists of PPAR\u03b3 such as BADGE14, PD06823515, T007090716, and SR-20217, exhibited the effect of blocking adipocyte differentiation. Notably, SR-20217 could improve the insulin sensitivity and reduce glucose levels of plasma, implying its potential application in the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The natural product 7-chloroarctinone-b (CAB, Figure 1) is a new thiophene-acetylene type of derivative isolated from the Rhaponticum uniflorum's roots18. Rhaponticum uniflorum (Asteraceae family) is a perennial herbaceous plant which is widely distributed in the northern part of China. Thiophene-acetylenes (ie ethynylthiophenes) represent a unique class of natural products exhibiting a wide variety of biological activities ranging from antitumor, antiviral, anti-HIV, antifungal to insecticidal activities 18. By random screening against our lab in-house natural product library, CAB was discovered as a new PPAR\u03b3 antagonist. The CAB antagonistic activity against the rosiglitazone-induced recruitment of the coactivator for PPAR\u03b3 was evaluated in both Gal4/UAS and yeast two-hybrid systems. CAB could efficiently antagonize both hormone and rosiglitazone induced adipocyte differentiation in cell culture. It is thus expected that CAB might be potentially used as a lead compound for anti-obesity agent discovery. In the investigation of the PPAR\u03b3-LBD/RXR\u03b1-LBD interaction, purified RXR\u03b1-LBD protein was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip, and the published approach was then applied to test the binding ability of PPAR\u03b3-LBD towards RXR\u03b1-LBD in the presence or absence of compounds19. All the results were reflected by RU (resonance units) values recorded directly by the Biacore 3000 instrument. The mammalian one-hybrid assay system was used to investigate the effects of CAB on PPAR\u03b3-LBD in HEK-293T cells, where the UAS-TK-Luc reporter and the fusion construct of GAL4-PPAR\u03b3-LBD were transiently co-transfected. In addition, the effects of CAB on the full-length PPAR\u03b3 were also examined in HEK-293T cells that were transiently transfected with plamids of pSV-PPRE-Luc (0.3 \u03bcg/well), pCDNA3.1-PPAR\u03b3 (0.2 \u03bcg/well) and pCDNA3.1-RXR\u03b1 (0.2 \u03bcg/well)20. Adipogenesis was determined by staining lipids with Oil Red O. The expression of adipocyte marker (aP2) was determined by Western blot analysis using anti-aP2 antibody (Cayman chemical; diluted 1:200). To further investigate the ability of CAB in modulation of PPAR\u03b3 transcription, transactivation assay was performed. In the assay, HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with full-length PPAR\u03b3, RXR\u03b1, and a reporter plasmid containing the PPAR response element. Transfected cells were incubated with different concentrations of CAB with or without rosiglitazone. As shown in Figure 3A, co-treatment with 2.5 \u03bcmol/L rosiglitazone and increasing concentrations of CAB resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in rosiglitazone-stimulated PPAR\u03b3 transcriptional activity. As shown in Figure 3B, CAB itself could also inhibit PPAR\u03b3 basal transcriptional activity induced by endogenous PPAR\u03b3 ligands. These results indicate that CAB is a dose-dependent inhibitor of PPAR\u03b3 transcriptional activity whether stimulated by its agonist, rosiglitazone, or by other ligands. To further confirm the above hypothesis, the yeast two-hybrid system regarding the PPAR\u03b3-LBD and its co-activator CBP (cAMP-response-element binding protein) was constructed. CBP is a critical transcription co-activator of PPAR\u03b3, and its interaction with PPAR\u03b3 could be enhanced by the binding of rosiglitazone to PPAR\u03b321. To test the antagonistic activity of CAB on this rosiglitazone-enhanced PPAR\u03b3/CBP binding, we transformed pGADT7-mCBP (aa 1\u2013464) and pGBKT7-PPAR\u03b3-LBD (aa 204\u2013447) plasmids into the yeast strain AH109 and investigated their interactions with or without compounds. As shown in Figure 5B, CAB could efficiently antagonize the rosiglitazone (10 \u03bcmol/L) stimulated PPAR\u03b3-LBD/CBP interaction with an IC50 of 2.18 \u03bcmol/L, consistent with the result (IC50=5.61 \u03bcmol/L) from the UAS/Gal4 system based assay. To further confirm CAB as a PPAR\u03b3 antagonist to block 3T3-L1 cell differentiation, the ability of CAB in inhibiting rosiglitazone-activated adipogenesis was also examined. As indicated in Figure 6A and 6B, similar to the case in the inhibition of hormone-induced 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, CAB could also restrain the rosiglitazone-induced adipogenesis. In the current work, the natural product 7-chloroarctinone-b (CAB) was randomly screened out as a novel PPAR\u03b3 antagonist from our lab in-house natural product library. CAB was isolated from the roots of Rhaponticum uniflorum (L.) DC., and exhibited a wide variety of biological activities including antitumor, antiviral, anti-HIV, antifungal and insecticidal activity18. SPR technology based investigation and transactivation assay demonstrated that CAB was a specific PPAR\u03b3 antagonist. To further examine the potential antagonistic mechanism of this compound, its effects on PPAR\u03b3/RXR\u03b1 heterodimerization and PPAR\u03b3 co-activator recruitment were inspected. The results indicated that CAB considerably antagonized both rosiglitazone-induced PPAR\u03b3-LBD/RXR\u03b1-LBD binding and rosiglitazone-simulated PPAR\u03b3 coactivator recruitment. As previously reported, there are at least two pathways involved in 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. One involves PPAR\u03b3 and the other C/EBP22. PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBPs are both known to be the direct transcriptional activators of several fat cell genes, and the best characterized adipocyte-specific regulatory DNA sites contain the binding sites for both factors23. Apart from C/EBP\u03b1, ectopic expression of C/EBP \u03b2 and -\u03b4 can also induce the adipocyte differentiation of fibroblasts24. It has been proposed that PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1 could synergize each other to powerfully promote the adipocyte developmental program in fibroblastic cells. The PPAR\u03b3 pathway exists in various tissues in addition to adipose and is targeted for therapeutic application in a variety of diseases, including adiposity and diabetes25. Several PPAR\u03b3 target genes such as aP2, CD36, ACO, and LPL, are involved in adipocyte differentiation26. The adipocyte fatty acid binding protein aP2, also a target gene of liver X receptors, plays an important role in fatty acid metabolism, adipocyte differentiation and atherosclerosis27. We tested the potential agonistic and antagonistic effects of CAB on LXR\u03b1/SRC1 interaction in yeast two-hybrid system, but no obvious activities were obtained (results not shown). Therefore, the inhibition by CAB against 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation might be majorly ascribed to its antagonistic activity against PPAR\u03b3. It is noted that some PPAR\u03b3 antagonists exhibit opposite activities in different cell lines. Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) is a recently discovered PPAR\u03b3 antagonist in adipogenic cells, but acted as a PPAR\u03b3 agonist in macrophage-like cell line RAW 264.728. Thus CAB may have agonistic activity in some special cell lines. Rosiglitazone, a PPAR\u03b3 agonist, is currently one of the most commonly used anti-diabetic drugs. However, moderate reduction of PPAR\u03b3 activity observed in heterozygous PPAR\u03b3-deficient mice prevents high-fat diet induced insulin resistance and obesity29, and the PPAR\u03b3 antagonist SR202 improves insulin sensitivity and reduces plasma glucose levels17. Therefore, although the PPAR\u03b3 antagonist, CAB, exhibits effects opposite to rosiglitazone, it might have potential applications in lowering blood glucose. In summary, the new thiophene-acetylene type of natural product, 7-chloroarctinone-b (CAB), was discovered as a selective PPAR\u03b3 antagonist. It efficiently antagonizes both hormone and rosiglitazone induced adipocyte differentiation in cell culture. Yong-tao LI, Jing CHEN, Jin HUANG, and Yue-wei GUO designed this study. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology based assay and transactivation assay, which were used to screen PPAR\u03b3 antagonists, were performed by Yong-tao LI and Li LI. Experiments investigating the antagonistic mechanism of CAB and evaluating the effects of CAB on adipocyte differentiation were performed by Yong-tao LI. Xu SHEN, Hua-liang JIANG, and Yue-wei GUO supervised the project. Yong-tao LI, Tian-cen HU, Jing CHEN, Jin HUANG, and Xu SHEN contributed to manuscript preparation.

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline and behavior disturbance and eventually leads to death1. AD is characterized by a complicated pathogenesis, and the accumulation of amyloid plaques that are composed of insoluble amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated Tau proteins are two typical hallmarks of this disease2. Accordingly, targeting A\u03b2 or Tau phosphorylation has been long believed to be a viable strategy for drug discovery against AD. A\u03b2 is generated from the sequential cleavage of amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (APP) by \u03b2-site APP cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1) and \u03b3-secretase3. In the discovery of inhibitors of A\u03b2 production, BACE1, as a rate-limiting enzyme for A\u03b2 generation, has received much attention. However, no BACE1 inhibitor has passed clinical trials4. Recently, the down-regulation of BACE1 expression was suggested as a new approach for anti-AD drug discovery5,6 based on the fact that suppression of BACE1 expression efficiently improves AD symptoms7,8. Apart from A\u03b2 inhibiting production, promoting A\u03b2 clearance is also regarded as a valuable strategy in anti-AD research9. In this case, the discovery of autophagy activators has received major attention because autophagy is implicated to have an important role in A\u03b2 clearance10. It has been discovered that activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) disrupts autophagy via phosphorylation of Unc51-like kinase 1 (ULK1), which is an initiator of the autophagy process11, whereas AKT (protein kinase B, PKB) as a positive regulator of mTOR is regulated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase, PI3K)12. Therefore, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is highly associated with autophagy-mediated A\u03b2 clearance. Meanwhile, Tau hyperphosphorylation is believed to be the compelling cause of tauopathy and is regulated by a series of kinases and phosphatases13, among which glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK5) have been identified as the main kinases for Tau pathogenesis14,15. Recently, in light of the failures in clinical trials for single-target anti-AD agents because of the complicated pathogenesis of this disease16,17, a multi-target-based strategy has been gradually accepted as a promising trend for the discovery of drug compounds against AD18. Therefore, it is expected that agents that are capable of inhibiting both A\u03b2 levels and Tau hyperphosphorylation should be more potent anti-AD agents19. Accordingly, considering that natural products are major sources of bioactive agents based on their large-scale structural and acting target diversities, we have recently constructed a \u201cone stone, two birds\u201d platform against our laboratory's in-house natural product library to identify agents that are able to inhibit both A\u03b2 levels and Tau hyperphosphorylation. As a result, THA, an extract of Thamnolia vermicularis, was discovered to improve learning ability in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by ameliorating A\u03b2/Tau pathology. Thamnolia vermicularis mainly grows in snowy areas at altitudes 4000 m above sea level (eg, Yunnan and Sichuan Provinces of China) and is named \u201cWhite snow tea\u201d (\u201cBaixuecha\u201d in Chinese) in China20. Thamnolia vermicularis has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for many years21, and pharmacological research has suggested that it has antioxidant and anticancer functions and can be used for the treatment of hypertension, cough, and neurasthenia20,22. Recently, several phenolic compounds (eg, vermicularin, squamatic acid, barbatinic acid, D-arabitol, mannitol and baeomycesic acid) have been reported to be extracted from this type of lichen plant23. In the current work, we report that the ethanol extract of Thamnolia vermicularis (THA) improved learning ability in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by inhibiting both A\u03b2 levels and Tau hyperphosphorylation. The mechanisms underlying the TH\u0391-mediated pharmacological events against AD were intensively investigated. Our results highlight the potential of THA in the treatment of AD. Thamnolia vermicularis (2.0 kg) was extracted with 95% EtOH under reflux (20 L \u00d73) for 2 h. The extract was filtered, and the filtration was concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain 2 L of mixed suspension. The suspension was sedimentated for 5 h, followed by centrifugation at 4000 rounds per minute to yield a residue, and then dried to yield 150 g of the total phenolic acids. According to HPLC-UV analysis, the contents of squamatic acid (1) and baeomycesic acid (2) (Figure 1A) in the total phenolic acids were 42% and 46%, respectively. SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 (DMEM/F12) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 unit/mL penicillin-streptomycin, and BV2 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 unit/mL penicillin-streptomycin. CHO cells expressing APP and BACE1 (CHO-APP/BACE1) were cultured in F12 supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 unit/mL penicillin-streptomycin. Primary astrocytes were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 unit/mL penicillin-streptomycin. All cells were cultured in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C. Brains were assayed according to a previously published method40. Hippocampal and cortical samples were homogenized in 50 mmol/L Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 5 mol/L guanidine hydrochloride by manual grinding, followed by lysis at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h. The homogenates were centrifuged at 20000\u00d7g at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min, and the content of A\u03b240 or A\u03b242 in the supernatant was detected using human A\u03b240 or A\u03b242 ELISA kits, respectively. In the assays, the total protein concentration of the sample was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo, USA), and all A\u03b2 concentration values were normalized to the total protein concentration. All samples prepared in cells and tissues were subject to Western blot analyses against PI3K, phospho-PI3K, AMPK, phospho-AMPK, AKT, phospho-AKT, Raptor, phospho-Raptor, mTOR, phospho-mTOR, P70S6K, phospho-P70S6K, ULK1, phospho-ULK1, BACE1, eIF2\u03b1, phospho-eIF2\u03b1, PERK, phospho-PERK, p62, Tau, phospho-Tau, GSK3\u03b2, phospho-GSK3\u03b2, CDK5, p35/p25, anti-A\u03b2, and GAPDH. The blots were visualized using a Dura detection system (Thermo, USA). Nine sections (10 mm thick) were produced per mouse, and each group comprised 4 mice. For Congo red staining, the sections were deparaffinized, hydrated and stained in Congo red for 20 min, and then differentiated in alkaline alcohol solution, followed by counterstaining with Gill's hematoxylin for 30 s, and finally mounting with neutral gum. The total number of Congo red stained plaques in the hippocampus and cortex (4 mice per group) was separately calculated for the statistical analysis. For Thioflavine S staining, the sections were deparaffinized, hydrated and stained in 1% Thioflavine S for 5 min, then differentiated in 70% alcohol solution for 5 min, followed by mounting with glycerol gel. The number of Thioflavine S plaques was counted for every three to six fields throughout the entire hippocampus and cortex (4 mice per group) using Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics). Thus, our results indicated that THA inhibited A\u03b2 production and this process involved the alleviation of PERK/eIF2\u03b1 signaling-mediated BACE1 expression. In addition, to prove that THA did not impair the cellular function of A\u03b2 endocytosis resulting in the decline of \u201cintracellular\u201d A\u03b2, we also performed the relevant assays in SH-SY5Y cells, in which we examined A\u03b2 levels in the supernatant and cell lysis by ELISA (Supplementary Figure S1B, S1C, Figure 3A, 3B). The results indicated that THA reduced A\u03b2 levels both in the supernatant (Supplementary Figure S1B, S1C) and the cell lysis (Figure 3A, 3B), which thus indirectly demonstrated that THA rendered no impairment on the cellular function of A\u03b2 endocytosis. First, an mRFP-GFP adenoviral infection-based assay50,51 was carried out to examine the effect of THA on autophagy flux and autolysosome formation in SH-SY5Y cells with an expression vector encoding mRFP-GFP fluorescence-tagged LC3 (microtubule-associated protein light chain 3) (mRFP-GFP-LC3). As indicated in Figure 4A, 4B, THA increased the puncta of mRFP-Red-LC3 and mRFP-GFP-yellow-LC3, thus demonstrating that THA effectively promoted autophagy flux and autolysosome formation. In addition, Western blot assay was also performed to further verify the activation of THA on autophagy in SH-SY5Y cells (Figure 4C, 4F), BV2 cells (Figure 4D, 4G) and primary astrocytes (Figure 4E, 4H) by testing several key marker proteins of autophagy, including Unc51-like kinase 1 (ULK1), LC3II and polyubiquitin binding protein p6252. The results demonstrated that THA reduced phosphorylated ULK1 and increased LC3II protein levels in all three tested cells. It was noted that THA suppressed p62 levels in both SH-SY5Y cells and primary astrocytes, but had no effects on BV2 cells, possibly due to the cellular selectivity of THA, similar to the case of a previously published report43. Thus, these results indicated that THA activated autophagy in the cells. As expected, the results demonstrated that THA decreased the phosphorylation of mTOR, PI3K and AKT, whereas it increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and Raptor in all three tested cells. THA suppressed P70S6K phosphorylation in both SH-SY5Y cells and primary astrocytes but had no effects on BV2 cells, probably due to the cellular selectivity of THA. Thus, these results indicated that THA activated autophagy by regulating both the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and AMPK/Raptor/mTOR signaling pathways. Furthermore, in vitro CDK5 and GSK3\u03b2 enzyme activity assays were also performed. The results demonstrated that HTA had no effects on CDK5 enzymatic activity (Figure 6G, PHA-793887: CDK5 inhibitor41) but inhibited GSK3\u03b2 enzymatic activity with an IC50 of 1.32\u00b10.85 \u03bcg/mL (Figure 6H). Therefore, all these results suggested that THA reduced Tau phosphorylation by functioning as a GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor. The results demonstrated that in the training trials, the escape latencies of the non-transgenic vehicle group to find the platform were significantly shorter compared with the transgenic AD model vehicle group (Figure 7A, 7B), indicating that the space learning ability of the transgenic AD model mice were obviously impaired. However, the latencies of the THA-administered (300 mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7d\u22121) transgenic AD model group were significantly decreased compared with the transgenic vehicle group (Figure 7A, 7B). We chose two doses of THA, 100 and 300 mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7d\u22121, for this study. Because THA at 100 mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7d\u22121 exhibited no effect, we omitted this dosage in the text. These results suggested that THA ameliorated the space learning ability of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. After the MWM test, the mice were sacrificed, and the left sides of the brains were immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for histological analysis. As expected, the numbers of Congo red (Figure 8A\u20138D)-stained senile plaques in both the hippocampus and cortex of the vehicle-administered transgenic mice were greater than in the vehicle-administered non-transgenic mice. However, treatment with THA (300 mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7d\u22121) could effectively reverse the high senile plaque numbers in both the hippocampus and cortex of the transgenic mice. Similarly, the Thioflavine S staining assay results (Figure 8E-8H) also confirmed the inhibition of THA against senile plaque formation in the transgenic mice. The senile plaque burdens stained by Thioflavine S in the hippocampus and cortex of the vehicle-administered transgenic mice were markedly more severe compared with those of vehicle-administered non-transgenic mice, whereas treatment with THA reversed the senile plaque formation in the transgenic mice. In the assay, we detected the effects of THA on the protein level of sAPP\u03b2/BACE1 and on the phosphorylation of PERK/eIF2\u03b1 in the cortices of the tested mice by Western blotting. As indicated in Figure 9A, 9B, the protein level of sAPP\u03b2/BACE1 and the phosphorylation of PERK/eIF2\u03b1 in the transgenic mice were higher than those in the non-transgenic mice, whereas treatment with THA apparently inhibited those effects compared with the THA-non-treated transgenic group. Next, we carried out an RT-PCR assay to investigate if THA inhibits BACE1 transcription and found that THA failed to affect BACE1 mRNA levels (Figure 9C). These results indicated that THA alleviated PERK/eIF2\u03b1-mediated BACE1 translation in response to A\u03b2 production inhibition in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, in line with the corresponding cell-based results. Taken together, these results indicated that THA stimulated PI3K/AKT/mTOR- and AMPK/Raptor/mTOR-mediated autophagy in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Subsequently, a Western blot assay was performed. Similar to the cell-based assays, we investigated the effects of THA on GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation at Ser9/Tyr216 and CDK5 and p35/p25 protein levels in the transgenic mice. As shown in Figure 10E, 10F, an approximately 40% change in p-Tau/Tau between wild-type and AD mice was determined, and this result was close to a published report where a 50% change in p-Tau/Tau between wild-type and AD mice was found64,65. In addition, THA administration stimulated the inactive form of GSK3\u03b2 (phosphorylated at Ser9) and inhibited the active form of GSK3\u03b2 (phosphorylated at Tyr216) in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, indicating that THA could inhibit GSK3\u03b2 activity in vivo. As expected, THA had no effects on CDK5 or p35/p25 in the mice (Figure 10E, 10F). Thus, the results demonstrated that THA reduced Tau phosphorylation by inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 in the APP/PS1 transgenic mice, in consistence with the cell-based results. Along with the fast pace of an aging society are aging diseases (eg, AD, type 2 diabetes, cancers, etc), which severely afflict the aged population. In fact, the neurodegenerative disease AD has been clinically accepted as one of the leading causes of death24. It is characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive and behavioral disturbances, and there is no efficient treatment against this disease, although there have been clinical drugs capable of improving the symptoms of AD68. Considering the complicated pathogenesis of AD, multi-targets have become a focus in the discovery of drug compounds for treatment of this disease18. In the current work, given the diversities in both the chemical structures and acting targets for natural products, we established a multi-target strategy for discovering active reagents capable of suppressing both A\u03b2 levels and Tau hyperphosphorylation from natural products. We found that the extract of Thamnolia vermicularis improves learning ability in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by ameliorating both A\u03b2 and Tau pathologies, which highly supports the efficiency of our strategy for the discovery of potential anti-AD agents. Recently, several pharmacological functions have been discovered for the lichen Thamnolia vermicularis in the treatment of various diseases, including hypertension, cough, and neurasthenia, and for its antioxidant and anticancer properties20,22. Therefore, our current results concerning its anti-AD activity have also expanded the new pharmacological functions for this natural product. Various types of pure small molecules have been separated from Thamnolia vermicularis69, but no report has yet been published regarding their potential multi-target function in the treatment of AD. Considering the relatively high contents of squamatic acid (42%) and baeomycesic acid (46%) (Figure 1A) in THA, we also examined the potential activity of these two compounds in the regulation of A\u03b2 accumulation and/or Tau phosphorylation, and the results indicated that neither of these two compounds exhibited effects (data not shown). Currently, few reports have been published on the functions of baeomycesic acid and squamatic acid70,71, and baeomycesic acid was determined to exhibit antiproliferative effects on several human tumor cell lines72. Thus, it is expected that the current study may also provide chemical direction for the discovery of compounds with multi-target activities in the repression of A\u03b2/Tau pathology from Thamnolia vermicularis. In summary, we reported that the ethanol extract of Thamnolia vermicularis (THA) improved learning ability in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by inhibiting both A\u03b2 levels and Tau hyperphosphorylation. In addition, THA as an effective autophagy activator, also efficiently prolonged the lifespan of wild-type Drosophila melanogaster, thus exhibiting potential in the prevention of AD by prolonging aging. Figure 12 shows a proposed model for the amelioration of A\u03b2/Tau pathology by THA. TH\u0391 stimulated either PI3K/AKT/mTOR- or AMPK/raptor/mTOR signaling-mediated autophagy in promotion of A\u03b2 clearance as both a PI3K inhibitor and an AMPK indirect activator and restrained A\u03b2 production as a suppressor against PERK/eIF2\u03b1-mediated BACE1 expression. Additionally, as a GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor, THA inhibited Tau hyperphosphorylation. Therefore, our results have highlighted the potential of THA in the treatment of AD.

In this study, 829 diverse compounds with rat carcinogenicity were collected from Carcinogenic Potency Database (CPDB). Using six types of fingerprints to represent the molecules, 30 binary and ternary classification models were generated to predict chemical carcinogenicity by five machine learning methods. The models were evaluated by an external validation set containing 87 chemicals from ISSCAN database. The best binary model was developed by MACCS keys and kNN algorithm with predictive accuracy at 83.91\u2009%, while the best ternary model was also generated by MACCS keys and kNN algorithm with overall accuracy at 80.46\u2009%. Furthermore, the best binary and ternary classification models were used to estimate carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke components containing 2251 compounds. 981 ones were predicted as carcinogens by binary classification model, while 110 compounds were predicted as strong carcinogens and 807 ones as weak carcinogens by ternary classification model. The results indicated that our models would be helpful for prediction of chemical carcinogenicity. ",

        "abstract": "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are worldwide used drugs for analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory therapeutics. However, NSAIDs often cause several serious liver injuries, such as drug-induced liver injury (DILI), and the molecular mechanisms of DILI have not been clearly elucidated. In this study, we developed a systems pharmacology approach to explore the mechanism-of-action of NSAIDs. We found that the Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) antagonism of NSAIDs is a potential molecular mechanism of DILI through systematic network analysis and in vitro assays. Specially, the quantitative real-time PCR assay reveals that indomethacin and ibuprofen regulate FXR downstream target gene expression in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, the western blot shows that FXR antagonism by indomethacin induces the phosphorylation of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), promotes the activation of caspase9, and finally causes DILI. In summary, our systems pharmacology approach provided novel insights into molecular mechanisms of DILI for NSAIDs, which may propel the ways toward the design of novel anti-inflammatory pharmacotherapeutics.",

        "abstract": "Integration of viral-DNA into host chromosome mediated by the viral protein HIV-1 integrase (IN) is an essential step in the HIV-1 life cycle. In this process, human protein Lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75) is discovered to function as a cellular co-factor for integration. LEDGF/p75-HIV-1 IN interaction represents an attractive target for anti-HIV therapy. In this study, approved drugs were investigated for the finding of potential inhibitors on this target. Via molecular docking against the LEDGF/p75-binding pocket of HIV-1 IN, 26 old drugs were selected from the DrugBank and purchased for bioassays. Among them, eight, namely Atorvastatin, Bumetanide, Candesartan, Carbidopa, Diclofenac, Diflunisal, Eprosartan, and Sulindac, were identified as potential inhibitors of LEDGF/p75- HIV-1 IN interaction, whose IC(50) values ranged from 6.5\u2009\u03bcM to 36.8\u2009\u03bcM. In addition, Atorvastatin was previously reported to block HIV-1 replication and may have an important implication for the treatment of AIDS. Our results suggested a mechanism of action for the anti-HIV effects of Atorvastatin. This work provides a new example of inhibitors targeting protein-protein interaction and confirmed that old drugs were valuable sources for antiviral drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "Considering the complicated pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), multi-targets have become a focus in the discovery of drugs for treatment of this disease. In the current work, we established a multi-target strategy for discovering active reagents capable of suppressing both A\u03b2 level and Tau hyperphosphorylation from natural products, and found that the ethanol extract of Thamnolia vermicularis (THA) was able to improve learning ability in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by inhibiting both A\u03b2 levels and Tau hyperphosphorylation. SH-SY5Y and CHO-APP/BACE1 cells and primary astrocytes were used in cell-based assays. APP/PS1 transgenic mice [B6C3-Tg(APP, PS1dE9)] were administered THA (300 mg\u00b7kg\u00b7d, ig) for 100 d. After the administration was completed, the learning ability of the mice was detected using a Morris water maze (MWM) assay; immunofluorescence staining, Congo red staining and Thioflavine S staining were used to detect the senile plaques in the brains of the mice. ELISA was used to evaluate A\u03b2 and sAPP\u03b2 contents, and Western blotting and RT-PCR were used to investigate the relevant signaling pathway regulation in response to THA treatment. In SH-SY5Y cells, TH\u0391 (1, 10, 20 \u03bcg/mL) significantly stimulated PIK/AKT/mTOR and AMPK/raptor/mTOR signaling-mediated autophagy in the promotion of A\u03b2 clearance as both a PIK inhibitor and an AMPK indirect activator, and restrained A\u03b2 production as a suppressor against PERK/eIF2\u03b1-mediated BACE1 expression. Additionally, THA functioned as a GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor with an IC of 1.32\u00b10.85 \u03bcg/mL, repressing Tau hyperphosphorylation. Similar effects on A\u03b2 accumulation and Tau hyperphosphorylation were observed in APP/PS1 transgenic mice treated with THA. Furthermore, administration of THA effectively improved the learning ability of APP/PS1 transgenic mice, and markedly reduced the number of senile plaques in their hippocampus and cortex. The results highlight the potential of the natural product THA for the treatment of AD.",

Their structures were elucidated by analysis of spectroscopic data. Known mycoepoxydiene showed potent cytotoxic activity towards both MCF-7 and noncancerous Vero cell lines with the respective IC 50  values of 9.27 and 4.06\u00a0\u03bcM. It exhibited inhibition on glucose output in mouse primary hepatocytes with the IC 50  value of 16.06\u00a0\u03bcM, but did not show cytotoxicity on primary mouse hepatocytes. Additionally, known cytosporone B displayed protective activity against INS-1 832/13 pancreatic  \u03b2 -cells by an EC 50  value of 11.08\u00a0\u03bcM whereas known diaporthalasin displayed antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  with an MIC value of 4\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. Both of them were noncytotoxic to Vero cells.",

The principle and characters of the system were introduced. The PID control over temperature based on PLC was realized. Simulation on the three-phase asymmetric load system was done by computer softwares to discuss the influences of such loads further. The practical operation showed that the overshoot of temperature decreased as well as the adjusting time, and control effect was obviously enhanced, same was the product quality.",

An increasingly accepted view posits that weak targeting has no biological function and each miRNA effectively has only a few functional targets. Here, we review the evolutionary arguments for this postulate and find these arguments seriously flawed. In contrast, from the systems perspective, the power of broad and weak targeting may reside in the cumulative effects of all repressions, which collectively stabilize gene regulatory networks. This view predicts that miRNAs would show little tendency to downsize their target pools. A survey of \"twin-miRs\" production indeed validates this prediction.",

        "abstract": "Each animal microRNA (miRNA) targets many genes for repression. Down-regulation of most of these targets is weak and has no detectable individual phenotypic effect. Whether this extensive weak repression is biologically relevant is a central issue in the debate on miRNA functionality. In the \"small (target) pool\" view, weak repression is non-functional and should be gradually removed during evolution. However, since the selective advantage of removing individual targets is small, testing this hypothesis is a challenge. We propose a novel approach by using miRNAs we call twin-miRs, which produce two mature products from the hairpin of the same miRNA precursor. Loss of the minor miR partner would affect all its targets and thus could be visible to selection. Since the minor miRs repress all their targets weakly, the \"small pool\" hypothesis would predict the elimination of twin-miRs over time. Surveying and sequencing 45 small RNA libraries in Drosophila, we found that nearly 40% of miRNAs produce twin-miRs. The minor forms are expressed in non-trivial abundance and repress their targets weakly. Interestingly, twin-miRs are often evolutionarily old, highly conserved, and comparable to solo-miRs in expression. Since there is no measurable trend towards reduction in target pool size, we conclude that at least some of the weak repression interactions are functional. A companion study using the May-Wigner theory of network stability suggests that distributed weak repression cumulatively contributes to stability of gene regulatory networks.",

        "abstract": "The prevalence of de novo coding genes is controversial due to the length and coding constraints. Non-coding genes, especially small ones, are freer to evolve de novo by comparison. The best examples are microRNAs (miRNAs), a large class of regulatory molecules ~22 nt in length. Here, we study 6 de novo miRNAs in Drosophila which, like most new genes, are testis-specific. We ask how and why de novo genes die because gene death must be sufficiently frequent to balance the many new births. By knocking out each miRNA gene, we could analyze their contributions to each of the 9 components of male fitness (sperm production, length, competitiveness etc.). The knockout mutants often perform better in some components, and slightly worse in others, than the wild type. When two of the younger miRNAs are assayed in long-term laboratory populations, their total fitness contributions are found to be essentially zero. These results collectively suggest that adaptive de novo genes die regularly, not due to the loss of functionality, but due to the canceling-out of positive and negative fitness effects, which may be characterized as \"quasi-neutrality\". Since de novo genes often emerge adaptively and become lost later, they reveal ongoing period-specific adaptations, reminiscent of the \"Red-Queen\" metaphor for long term evolution.",

        "abstract": "Populations accumulate deleterious mutations that have yet to be removed by natural selection. This mutated portion of the population that does not contribute to its fitness is called the genetic load and is proportional to the deleterious mutation rate. Given the genomic instability of cancer cells, the genetic load could be substantial if the instability indeed leads to loss of cell fitness. We hypothesize that because aneuploidy and copy number variations (CNVs) are the most common forms of genome instability, their fitness consequences may determine the genetic load in cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, we randomly selected single cells from a HeLa cell line and measured the cell growth rate via daily cell counting and an MTT cell proliferation assay. We then measured the genetic changes and resulting growth rate variation. We observed rapid generation of heterogeneity in the growth rate within the population. The growth rate of different progeny cells was stable indicating that it is genetically determined. Next, using whole genome sequencing of recently descended clones of a single HeLa cell, we found that cells with fewer newly acquired CNVs have higher proliferation rates vice versa. This indicated that CNV accumulation decreased cell fitness systematically. We next estimated the rate of CNV mutation by measuring the growth rate of two daughter cells from single proliferation and found that there is approximately 1 deleterious mutation in every 4 cell divisions. We speculated that due to a high, deleterious CNV mutation rate, tumor cells inevitably accumulate deleterious CNVs and a large percentage of tumor cells are genetically defective. Accordingly, we observed that the average growth rate of tumor cell populations decreased in the short term since defective cells accumulated in the population and the variation of cellular growth rates within the population increased. By modeling the process of mutation accumulation and measuring cell growth rate, we estimated that the deleterious mutation rate in HeLa cells is about 0.26-0.31 per cell division, and that HeLa cells reduce roughly 5%-6% of fitness for every cell division. The observations of a high proliferation rate and high genetic load in this representative tumor cell line indicates a \u201chigh risk, high reward\u201d evolution strategy for tumor cells and suggests that increasing the level of genomic instability may cause the meltdown of tumor cell population by forcing cells to accelerate the cell cycle.

The main mutational events are copy number variations (CNVs), which happen at an extraordinarily high rate of 0.29 events per cell division. The average fitness reduction, estimated to be 18% per mutation, is also very high. HeLa cell populations therefore have very substantial genetic load and, at this level, natural population would likely experience mutational meltdown.

        "abstract": "In the absence of both positive and negative selection, coding sequences evolve at a neutral rate (R\u2009=\u20091). Such a high genomic rate is generally not achievable due to the prevalence of negative selection against codon substitutions. Remarkably, somatic evolution exhibits the seemingly neutral rate R \u223c 1 across normal and cancerous tissues. Nevertheless, R \u223c 1 may also mean that positive and negative selection are both strong, but equal in intensity. We refer to this regime as quasi-neutral. Indeed, individual genes in cancer cells often evolve at a much higher, or lower, rate than R \u223c 1. Here, we show that 1) Quasi-neutrality is much more likely when populations are small (N\u2009<\u200950); 2) Stem cell populations in single normal tissue niches, from which tumors likely emerge, have a small N (usually < 50) but selection at this stage is measurable and strong; 3) When N dips below 50, selection efficacy decreases precipitously; 4) Notably, N is smaller in the stem-cell niche of the small intestine than in the colon. Hence, the \u223c 70 fold higher rate of phenotypic evolution (observed as cancer risk) in the latter can be explained by the greater efficacy of selection, which then leads to the fixation of more advantageous and fewer deleterious mutations in colon cancers. In conclusion, quasi-neutral evolution sheds a new light on a general evolutionary principle that helps to explain aspects of cancer evolution.",

        "abstract": "Molecular evolution is believed to proceed in small steps. The step size can be defined by a distance reflecting physico-chemical disparities between amino acid (AA) pairs that can be exchanged by single 1\u2009bp mutations. We show that AA substitution rates are strongly and negatively correlated with this distance but only when positive selection is relatively weak. We use the McDonald and Kreitman (MK) test to separate the influences of positive and negative selection. While negative selection is indeed stronger on AA substitutions generating larger changes in chemical properties of amino acids, positive selection operates by different rules. For 65 of the 75 possible pairs, positive selection is comparable in strength regardless of AA distance. However, the 10 pairs under the strongest positive selection all exhibit large leaps in chemical properties. Five of the 10 pairs are shared between Drosophila and Hominoids, thus hinting at a common but modest biochemical basis of adaptation across taxa. The hypothesis that adaptive changes often take large functional steps will need to be extensively tested. If validated, molecular models will need to better integrate positive and negative selection in the search for adaptive signal.",

        "abstract": "The widely accepted view that evolution proceeds in small steps is based on two assumptions: i) negative selection acts strongly against large differences (Kimura 1983); and ii) positive selection favors small-step changes (Fisher 1930). The two assumptions are not biologically connected and should be evaluated separately. To do so, we measure the substitution rates between codons, using the physico-chemical distance between amino acids (AAs) for step size. The distance used is a function of 48 physico-chemical properties. Between 9 pairs of closely-related species of plants, invertebrates and vertebrates, the evolutionary rate is indeed strongly and negatively correlated with the AA distance (\u0394U, scaled to [0, 1]). Remarkably, \u0394U is strongly correlated with the evolutionary rate (R2 u003e 0.8) in almost all taxa, as long as the genes are under some negative selection. \u0394U is thus a nearly-universal measure of evolutionary constraint. We conclude that negative selection is the driving force of the small-step evolution, the strength of which is governed by \u0394U. The possibility that positive selection may not follow the small-step rule will be tested in the companion study.",

        "abstract": "Transposable elements are key players in eukaryotic genomic diversity. Due to their high abundance, great heterogeneity, and replicative transposition, long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons are well suited as molecular markers for breeding and biodiversity studies, whereas their utilities in non-model organisms have been hindered by the lack of prior sequence knowledge. In this study, a putative complete (5362\u00a0bp) LTR retrotransposon was isolated and characterized in the mangrove species Kandelia candel (named KCRE1), and its transcription, insertional polymorphisms and copy number variations were also investigated. KCRE1 has all the features of a typical copia retroelement, and its transcription initiation and termination sites were identified by 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), respectively. KCRE1 exhibits high sequence similarity with the tomato retroelement Rider and is constitutively expressed in the leaf, root, flower, and hypocotyl tissues of K. candel. Based on KCRE1, sequence-specific amplification polymorphism (SSAP) markers were developed to explore genetic diversity across 30 individuals from three natural populations of K. candel in China. Six primer combinations yielded a total of 204 SSAP bands with an averaged percentage of polymorphic loci of 55.37 and 41.35\u00a0% at the species and population levels, respectively. Each individual had a distinct SSAP phenotype, and 14-23 unique bands were observed for each population. Accordingly, KCRE1 was highly abundant in the genome of K. candel and showed considerable copy number variation among the three populations. In conclusion, KCRE1 is the first transcriptionally active retrotransposon reported in K. candel, providing a useful tool for the elucidation of untapped genetic diversity in mangrove genomes.",

As a consequence, it may lead to the extinction of small populations. Relative to most unicellular organisms, cancer cells, with large and non-recombining genome and high mutation rate, could be particularly susceptible to such \"mutational meltdown\". However, the most common type of mutation in organismal evolution, namely, deleterious mutation, has received relatively little attention in the cancer biology literature. Here, by monitoring single-cell clones from HeLa cell lines, we characterize deleterious mutations that retard the rate of cell proliferation. The main mutation events are copy number variations (CNVs), which, estimated from fitness data, happen at a rate of 0.29 event per cell division on average. The mean fitness reduction, estimated reaching 18% per mutation, is very high. HeLa cell populations therefore have very substantial genetic load and, at this level, natural population would likely face mutational meltdown. We suspect that HeLa cell populations may avoid extinction only after the population size becomes large enough. Because CNVs are common in most cell lines and tumor tissues, the observations hint at cancer cells' vulnerability, which could be exploited by therapeutic strategies.",

Molecular dynamics simulations are conducted to investigate the mechanical response and the underlying deformation mechanism of two-phase TiAl intermetallic with  \u03b3 / \u03b1  2  interface. Uniaxial tensile loading is applied along three different directions under \u201cfree\u201d and \u201cconstrained\u201d boundary conditions respectively. The evolution of dislocations and cracks has been investigated in atomic scale. The results show that the stress-strain relation exhibits strong anisotropy. Meanwhile, the dominant failure mode is plastic deformation under free boundary condition while fracture under constrained boundary condition. Moreover, the phase interface can act as dislocation source or crack source under different boundary conditions.",

With the innovation of computer technique and labor division between enterprises, the upstream and downstream enterprises adopt multi-source neutral file to exchange part drawings. The traditional design methods based on casting process CAD tools are not convenient; thus, the process design and production cycle of castings are extended. To handle this problem, a new method for casting process CAD system based on multi-source neutral file is proposed, which broadens the traditional application of casting process CAD system. The new method is supported by four key techniques, including the CAD bottom development, multi-source neutral file display, interactive drawing, and non-parametric drawing for casting process, which are described in detail. A practical casting process CAD system based on multi-source neutral file is successfully developed. Compared with the traditional method, the application of the two actual castings process design based on the new method illustrates that the time of drawing can significantly be reduced and the cycle of casting process design can be shortened.",

The energy conservation equation was solved coupling with N-S equation. The temperature field calculated under the circumstance of taking fluid flow into consideration has been compared with the experiment results in a step casting. Feed path is computed by tracking the direction of the time gradient in each calculation during the solidification process. Effects of the liquid metal flow on the calculation results of feed paths and hot spots have been discussed in detail in a \u201cT\u201d shape casting. An experiment has been done to validate the accuracy of the proposed model. The originating points of the feed paths indicate hot spots that manifest as shrinkage defects. And the numerical as well as experimental validations demonstrate the effectiveness of time gradient method for feed-path calculation.",

Modifying and designing the feeding system has become more convenient with the help of the casting software, InteCAST. A common method of designing a feeding system is to first design the initial systems, run simulations with casting software, analyze the feedback, and then redesign. In this work, genetic, fruit fly, and interior point optimizer (IPOPT) algorithms were introduced to guide the optimal riser design for the feeding system. The results calculated by the three optimal algorithms indicate that the riser volume has a weak relationship with the modulus constraint; while it has a close relationship with the volume constraint. Based on the convergence rate, the fruit fly algorithm was obviously faster than the genetic algorithm. The optimized riser was also applied during casting, and was simulated using InteCAST. The numerical simulation results reveal that with the same riser volume, the riser optimized by the genetic and fruit fly algorithms has a similar improvement on casting shrinkage. The IPOPT algorithm has the advantage of causing the smallest shrinkage porosities, compared to those of the genetic and fruit fly algorithms, which were almost the same.",

Besides, a macro\u2013mesoscopic/microscopic coupling solution algorithm is proposed to improve computational efficiency. The simulation results of dendrite growth and grain growth of the alloy are obtained and compared with the results given in previous reports. The results show that the primary dendritic arm spacing and secondary dendritic arm spacing of the dendritic growth are consistent with the theoretical and experimental results.

        "abstract": "Display Omitted We propose a novel improved teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm with the concept of historical population.Two new operators are designed in the proposed algorithm to achieve the balance of exploration and exploitation ability.24 benchmark functions are tested with other algorithms to verify the good exploration and exploitation ability of proposed algorithm.The proposed algorithm is applied to address a combinatorial optimization problem in foundry industry with the design of coding and decoding mechanism. Teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is a novel nature-inspired algorithm that mimics the teaching and learning process. In this paper, an improved version of TLBO algorithm (I-TLBO) is investigated to enhance the performance of original TLBO by achieving a balance between exploitation and exploration ability. Inspired by the concept of historical population, two new phases, namely self-feedback learning phase as well as mutation and crossover phase, are introduced in I-TLBO algorithm. In self-feedback learning phase, a learner can improve his result based on the historical experience if his present state is better than the historical state. In mutation and crossover phase, the learners update their positions with probability based on the new population obtained by the crossover and mutation operations between present population and historical population. The design of self-feedback learning phase seeks the maintaining of good exploitation ability while the introduction of the mutation and crossover phase aims at the improvement of exploration ability in original TLBO. The effectiveness of proposed I-TLBO algorithm is tested on some benchmark functions and a combinatorial optimization problem of heat treating in foundry industry. The comparative results with some other improved TLBO algorithms and classic algorithms show that I-TLBO algorithm has significant advantages due to the balance between exploitation and exploration ability.",

        "abstract": "The Ti6Al4V alloy castings were produced by the investment casting process, and the hot isostatic pressing (HIP) was used to remove shrinkage from castings. The processing pressure and holding time for HIP were 150 MPa and 20 min, respectively. Four different HIP temperatures were tested, including 750 \u00baC, 850 \u00baC, 920 \u00baC and 950 \u00baC. To evaluate the effects of temperature on densification and microstructure of Ti6Al4V alloy treated by HIP, non-destructive testing and metallographic observation was performed. The experimental results show that the shrinkage was completely closed at 920 \u00baC and 950 \u00baC. The densification of Ti6Al4V alloy increased as the HIP temperature increased below 920 \u00baC. The lamellae were more uniform, the thickness of lamellae was obviously broadened and the structure was coarsen. Besides, the Norton creep equation was used to simulate the effect of different temperatures on the densification of Ti6Al4V alloy during HIP. The simulation results were in good agreement with the experimental results. It was also found that 920 \u00baC is a suitable temperature for HIP for Ti6Al4V alloy.",

        "abstract": "With the proliferation of digital cameras and mobile devices, people are taking much more photos than ever before. However, these photos can be redundant in content and varied in quality. Therefore there is a growing need for tools to manage the photo collections. One efficient photo management way is photo collection summarization which segments the photo collection into different events and then selects a set of representative and high quality photos (key photos) from those events. However, existing photo collection summarization methods mainly consider the low-level features for photo representation only, such as color, texture, etc, while ignore many other useful features, for example high-level semantic feature and location. Moreover, they often return fixed summarization results which provide little flexibility. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal and multi-scale photo collection summarization method by leveraging multi-modal features, including time, location and high-level semantic features. We first use Gaussian mixture model to segment photo collection into events. With images represented by those multi-modal features, our event segmentation algorithm can generate better performance since the multi-modal features can better capture the inhomogeneous structure of events. Next we propose a novel key photo ranking and selection algorithm to select representative and high quality photos from the events for summarization. Our key photo ranking algorithm takes the importance of both events and photos into consideration. Furthermore, our photo summarization method allows users to control the scale of event segmentation and number of key photos selected. We evaluate our method by extensive experiments on four photo collections. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than previous photo collection summarization methods.",

        "abstract": "With the ever-increasing use of smartphones and digital cameras, people are now able to take photos anywhere and anytime. Most of these photos simply end up stored in the cloud without further interaction. This occurs because we lack intelligent services to organize these personal photos well. Therefore, there is an urgent need for such a system to enable people to relive their memories by turning their photos into stories. This paper presents a storytelling system named Monet, which automatically creates interesting stories from personal photos by mimicking cinematic knowledge based on a set of predesigned editing styles. The system consists of two stages: photo summarization, which selects a subset of the \u201cbest\u201d photos to represent a photo collection, and story remixing, which generates a stylish music video from the selected photos. During photo summarization, photos are grouped into events based on multimodal features (time and location). The \u201cbest\u201d photos are then selected according to visual quality, event representativeness, and diversity. The second stage, story remixing, automatically selects an appropriate theme-dependent editing style based on the photo content. Each selected photo is converted to a video clip by applying a virtual camera with appropriate motions. A series of video effects, color filters, shapes, and transitions are then applied to the video clips according to cinematic rules. The generated video is finally multiplexed with a music clip to generate the story. Evaluations show that our system achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art photo event detection and story generation systems.",

        "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results on many visual recognition tasks. However, current CNN models still exhibit a poor ability to be invariant to spatial transformations of images. Intuitively, with sufficient layers and parameters, hierarchical combinations of convolution (matrix multiplication and non-linear activation) and pooling operations should be able to learn a robust mapping from transformed input images to transform-invariant representations. In this paper, we propose randomly transforming (rotation, scale, and translation) feature maps of CNNs during the training stage. This prevents complex dependencies of specific rotation, scale, and translation levels of training images in CNN models. Rather, each convolutional kernel learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the transform-invariant answer given the combinatorially large variety of transform levels of its input feature maps. In this way, we do not require any extra training supervision or modification to the optimization process and training images. We show that random transformation provides significant improvements of CNNs on many benchmark tasks, including small-scale image recognition, large-scale image recognition, and image retrieval.",

        "abstract": "Recent developments in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) have shown promising potential for modeling sequential data. Nevertheless, training LSTM is not trivial when there are multiple layers in the deep architectures. This difficulty originates from the initialization method of LSTM, where gradient-based optimization often appears to converge to poor local solutions. In this paper, we explore an unsupervised pretraining mechanism for LSTM initialization, following the philosophy that the unsupervised pretraining plays the role of a regularizer to guide the subsequent supervised training. We propose a novel encoder-decoder-based learning framework to initialize a multi-layer LSTM in a greedy layer-wise manner in which each added LSTM layer is trained to retain the main information in the previous representation. A multi-layer LSTM trained with our method outperforms the one trained with random initialization, with clear advantages on several tasks. Moreover, the multi-layer LSTMs converge 4 times faster with our greedy layer-wise training method.",

        "abstract": "Early pulmonary inflammation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) play important roles during lung fibrosis. Increasing evidence demonstrates that calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D3, has anti-inflammatory activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of calcitriol on bleomycin (BLM)-induced early pulmonary inflammation and subsequent EMT. Mice were intratracheally injected with BLM (3.0 mg/kg). In three calcitriol+BLM groups, mice were intraperitoneal (i.p.) injected with different doses of calcitriol (0.2, 1.0 or 5.0\u03bcg/kg) daily, beginning at 48h before BLM injection. Twenty-four hours, seven and fourteen days after BLM injection, pulmonary inflammation and EMT were evaluated. As expected, BLM-induced infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lungs was attenuated by calcitriol. BLM-induced pulmonary inflammatory cytokines were repressed by calcitriol. Moreover, BLM-induced nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) p65 was blocked by calcitriol. In addition, BLM-induced phosphorylation of pulmonary p38 MAPK and protein kinase B (Akt) was inhibited by calcitriol. Further analysis showed that BLM-induced \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), a marker for EMT in the lungs, was significantly attenuated by calcitriol. BLM-induced transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) up-regulation and Smad phosphorylation were attenuated by calcitriol. In conclusion, calcitriol inhibits BLM-induced early pulmonary inflammation and subsequent EMT.",

        "abstract": "Acute lung injury is a common complication of sepsis in intensive care unit patients with an extremely high mortality. The present study investigated the effects of calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) in sepsis-induced acute lung injury. Mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1.0mg/kg) to establish the animal model of sepsis-induced acute lung injury. Some mice were i.p. injected with calcitriol (1.0\u03bcg/kg) before LPS injection. An obvious infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lungs was observed beginning at 1h after LPS injection. Correspondingly, TNF-\u03b1 and MIP-2 in sera and lung homogenates were markedly elevated in LPS-treated mice. Interestingly, calcitriol obviously alleviated LPS-induced infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lungs. Moreover, calcitriol markedly attenuated LPS-induced elevation of TNF-\u03b1 and MIP-2 in sera and lung homogenates. Further analysis showed that calcitriol repressed LPS-induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation. In addition, calcitriol blocked LPS-induced nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) p65 and p50 subunit in the lungs. Taken together, these results suggest that calcitriol inhibits inflammatory cytokines production in LPS-induced acute lung injury.",

The aim of this study is to investigate whether vitamin D deficiency has an impact on testicular development and spermatogenesis in mice. In the control group and vitamin D deficient (VDD) diet group, dams and their pups were fed with standard-chow diet and VDD diet, respectively. Interestingly, testicular weight and sperm quality are reduced, testicular germ cell proliferation is suppressed, and the percentage of mature seminiferous tubules is decreased in VDD diet-fed mice. Moreover, testicular testosterone (T) synthesis enzymes are down-regulated in VDD diet-fed mice. Correspondingly, serum and testicular T levels are reduced in VDD diet-fed mice. Importantly, fertility index is reduced and live fetuses are decreased when both males and females are fed with VDD diet. These results provide evidence that vitamin D deficiency impairs testicular development and spermatogenesis.",

This study investigated whether total glucosides of paeony (TGP), the active constituents extracted from the root of Paeonia Lactiflora Pall, suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated proliferation, migration and invasion in androgen insensitive prostate cancer cells. PC-3 cells were incubated with LPS (2.0 \u03bcg/mL) in the absence or presence of TGP (312.5 \u03bcg /mL). As expected, cells at S phase and nuclear CyclinD1, the markers of cell proliferation, were increased in LPS-stimulated PC-3 cells. Migration activity, as determined by wound-healing assay and transwell migration assay, and invasion activity, as determined by transwell invasion assay, were elevated in LPS-stimulated PC-3 cells. Interestingly, TGP suppressed LPS-stimulated PC-3 cells proliferation. Moreover, TGP inhibited LPS-stimulated migration and invasion of PC-3 cells. Additional experiment showed that TGP inhibited activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/p38 in LPS-stimulated PC-3 cells. Correspondingly, TGP attenuated upregulation of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 in LPS-stimulated PC-3 cells. In addition, TGP inhibited nuclear translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in LPS-stimulated PC-3 cells. These results suggest that TGP inhibits inflammation-associated STAT3 activation and proliferation, migration and invasion in androgen insensitive prostate cancer cells.",

        "title": "Thermal Conductivity of Ultra-high Molecular Weight Polyethylene Crystal: Defect-effect Uncovered by 0 K limit Phonon Diffusion.",
        "abstract": "Crystalline ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) has the highest reported thermal conductivity at room temperature: 104 W/m\u00b7K, while theoretical predictions proposed an even higher value of 300 W/m\u00b7K. Defects and amorphous fraction in practical UHMWPE fibers significantly reduces the thermal conductivity from the ideal value. Although the amorphous effect can be readily analyzed based on the effective medium theory, the defect effects are poorly understood. This work reports on the temperature-dependent behavior (down to 22 K) of thermal diffusivity and conductivity of UHMWPE fibers in anticipation to observe the reduction in phonon density and scattering rate against temperature, and freeze out high momentum phonons to clearly observe the defect effects. By studying the temperature-dependent behavior of thermal reffusivity (\u0398: inverse of thermal diffusivity) of UHMWPE fibers, we are able to quantify the defect effects on thermal conductivity. After taking out the amorphous region's effect, the residual thermal reffusivity (\u03980) for the studied two samples at the 0 K limit is determined as 3.45\u00d710(4) s/m(2) and 2.95\u00d710(4) s/m(2), respectively. For rare/none-defects crystalline materials, \u03980 should be close to zero at the 0 K limit. The defect-induced low-momentum phonon mean free path is determined as 8.06 and 9.42 nm for the two samples. They are smaller than the crystallite size in the (002) direction (19.7 nm) determined by x-ray diffraction. This strongly demonstrates the diffuse phonon scattering at the grain boundaries. The grain boundary thermal conductance (G) can be evaluated as G\u2248\u03b2\u03c1cpv with sound accuracy. At room temperature, G is around 3.73 GW/m(2)\u00b7K for S2, comparable to that of interfaces with tight atomic bonding.",

        "title": "Thermal conductivity of giant mono- to few-layered CVD graphene supported on an organic substrate.",
        "abstract": "The thermal conductivity (k) of supported graphene is a critical property that reflects the graphene-substrate interaction, graphene structure quality, and is needed for thermal design of a graphene device. Yet the related k measurement has never been a trivial work and very few studies are reported to date, only at the \u03bcm level. In this work, for the first time, the k of giant chemical vapor decomposition (CVD) graphene supported on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is characterized using our transient electro-thermal technique based on a differential concept. Our graphene size is \u223cmm, far above the samples studied in the past. This giant graphene measurement eliminates the thermal contact resistance problems and edge phonon scattering encountered in \u03bcm-scale graphene k measurement. Such mm-scale measurement is critical for device/system-level thermal design since it reflects the effect of abundant grains in graphene. The k of 1.33-layered, 1.53-layered, 2.74-layered and 5.2-layered supported graphene is measured as 365 W m(-1) K(-1), 359 W m(-1) K(-1), 273 W m(-1) K(-1) and 33.5 W m(-1) K(-1), respectively. These values are significantly lower than the k of supported graphene on SiO2, and are about one order of magnitude lower than the k of suspended graphene. We speculate that the abundant C atoms in the PMMA promote more ready energy and momentum exchange with the supported graphene, and give rise to more phonon scattering than the SiO2 substrate. This leads to a lower k of CVD graphene on PMMA than that on SiO2. We attribute the existence of disorder in the sp(2) domain, graphene oxide (GO) and stratification in the 5.2-layered graphene to its more k reduction. The Raman linewidth (G peak) of the 5.2-layered graphene is also twice larger than that of the other three kinds of graphene, indicating the much more phonon scattering and shorter phonon lifetime in it. Also the electrical conductivity of the 5.2-layered graphene is about one-fifth of that for the other three. This further confirms the poor graphene quality of sample 4S, explaining its much lower k.",

        "abstract": "We report on the discovery of asymmetries of Raman scattering along one scanning direction, between two scanning directions, and by structure variation of the sample in space. Asymmetry of Raman shift along the x direction, and the asymmetry of Raman shift and linewidth between the two scanning directions (x and y) are found for a 1210 nm diameter silica particle. The observed asymmetries are confirmed by further 2D Raman scanning of the same particle. To further explore the asymmetry of Raman scattering, glass fibers of three diameters (0.53, 1.00, and 3.20 \u03bcm) are scanned along two directions. The asymmetry of Raman shift along each direction, the asymmetry of linewidth along the y direction, and the asymmetry of Raman shift and linewidth between the two scanning directions are discovered. Additionally, 11 nm-thick MoSe2 nanosheets on silicon are used to discover whether an asymmetry of Raman scattering exists at the edge of the nanosheets. One edge of the nanosheet is scanned in four directions and the asymmetry of Raman scattering caused by the step variation is also detected. All the observed Raman scattering asymmetries are explained soundly by the Raman signal diffraction and image shift on the CCD detector arrays of the Raman spectrometer. In practice, to use scanning Raman for surface structure study, great measure has to be taken to consider the structure-induced asymmetries to uncover the real Raman wave number variation by intrinsic material structure. We propose a signal processing method by averaging the scanning points along four directions to eliminate the interference of the edge. This method works well to significantly suppress the asymmetries of Raman properties and uncover the real Raman signal change by structure variation.",

        "abstract": "Current polarized Raman-based techniques for identifying the crystalline orientation of black phosphorus suffer big uncertainty and unreliability because of the complex interference involving excitation laser wavelength, scattering light wavelength, and sample thickness. Here, for the first time, we present a new optothermal Raman spectroscopy (OT-Raman) for identifying crystalline orientation. With a physical mechanism based on the anisotropic optical absorption of polarized laser and the resulting heating, the OT-Raman can identify the crystalline orientation explicitly regardless of excitation wavelength and sample thickness by Raman frequency-power differential \u03a6 (=\u2202\u03c9/\u2202P). \u03a6 has the largest (smallest) value when the laser polarization is along the armchair (zigzag) direction. The OT-Raman technique has a strong robustness and is able to identify the crystalline orientation of BP samples with thickness up to 300 nm at least and up 1200 nm potentially.",

However, this rotation modality is not widely used in manufacturing scenarios due to the lack of associated interpolation algorithm, which therefore impedes the application of PKMs. In this work, a modified spline method is designed to interpolate 5-axis PKM toolpath described by Tu0026T angle. Quintic splines are constructed in both positional and orientational trajectories for smoothness requirement, and the interpolation quality is further reinforced by anti-distortion strategy and coordinating reparameterization spline. Simulation based on actual toolpath and machine model prove that the proposed algorithm realizes the smoothness of acceleration in all toolpath components, decreases the shock to the system, and reduces the surface error after cutting. The results indicate that the interpolation method in this paper can provide new algorithm for PKMs with Tu0026T angle and promote their development in the industrial manufacturing and production.",

Although parallel robotic machines are becoming popular in industry due to its unique advantages in manufacturing application, few methods are available for its simulation. This paper presents a work achieved by combining conventional CAM analysis tool HSMWorks, Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software SolidWorks, and programming tools such as Python and MATLAB to realize the machining movement simulation of a parallel robotic machine. Firstly, an original NC code interpreter is compiled in Python that interprets G-code generated by HSMWorks. Then, necessary coordinate transformation and kinematic calculation are done by using MATLAB. Finally, driving data are imported into virtual machine tool in SolidWorks, and a complete motion simulation environment is then developed. The proposed method is a general approach, which can be upgraded and modified for the simulation of parallel robotic machines with any structure.",

        "abstract": "China is one of the countries with most abundant livestock and poultry resources in the world. The average annual growth rate of output value of livestock and poultry industry reaches 13%, and the output value of livestock and poultry industry accounts for more than 35% of total agricultural output. A large number of byproducts are produced in animal slaughtering and processing operations. If livestock and poultry byproducts are effectively utilized, this will make a huge contribution to GDP. At the same time, aquaculture is China's pillar industry. During fish processing, a large number of byproducts (including fish heads, fish skins, fish bones, fish scales, and viscera) are produced, which weighs approximately 40-55% of the raw fish. The byproducts of freshwater fish are more than 2.5 million tons per annum, most of which are not used. The effective use of byproducts has a direct influence on China's economic and environmental pollution. The nonuse or underutilization of byproducts not only leads to loss of potential revenue, but also results in to an increase in these products and their disposal costs. This paper makes a comprehensive review of the research progress of animal byproduct utilization to date, and aims to provide reference for the utilization and research of animal byproducts.",

        "abstract": "In order to investigate ultrasound dielectric pretreatment effect on oxidation resistance of vacuum fried apple chips, apple slices were pretreated at ultrasonic power for 150, 250 and 400 W and time for 10, 20 and, 30 min, followed by vacuum frying (VF) . The quality and oxidation resistance of fried apple were evaluated by testing the dielectric properties and comparing moisture content, oil uptake, color, acid value (AV) and peroxide value (PV) of apple chips.  Ultrasonic treatment can significantly change dielectric properties of apple slices. Moisture and oil contents of apple chips decreased with increasing ultrasonic power and time. During storage, color retention of fried apple chips processed by ultrasound was improved. AV and PV values of fried apple chips processed by ultrasound were lower, which improved antioxidant properties of apple chips.  Results of the present study indicated that ultrasound dielectric pretreatment not only improved the quality of vacuum fried apple chips, but also improved its antioxidant properties.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The effects of pressurized argon and nitrogen treatments in combination with modified atmosphere on the quality characteristics of fresh-cut potatoes during cold storage were studied. Fresh-cut potatoes were pressurized with argon, nitrogen or their mixture (concentration ratio of 1:1) at 4\u2009MPa for 60\u2009min; treated potatoes were then sealed in bags filled with 4% O 2 , 2% CO 2 , 94% N 2  and stored at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Water loss, color, firmness, ascorbic acid and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, respiration rate and aerobic plate count were measured every 3 d. Results showed that argon treatment successfully delayed the losses of moisture, ascorbic acid, color and firmness Such a treatment also significantly inhibited respiration rate and membrane oxidation as measured via MDA content. The number of microbes in treated fresh-cut potatoes was significantly reduced. Pressurized mixed argon-nitrogen treatment had a better effect on maintaining the quality of fresh-cut potatoes than nitrogen treatment. These results indicate that the combination of pressurized argon or mixed gas treatment with modified atmosphere is an effective method to maintain the quality of fresh-cut potatoes during refrigerated storage.",

        "abstract": "Transition from laying to incubation behavior in chicken is an interesting topic in reproductive biology. The decline of incubation behavior in chicken population has led to considerable phenotypic differences in reproductive traits between breeds. However, the exact genetic mechanism of the reproductive phase transition still largely unknown and little is known about the gene expression changes that contribute to the phenotypic differences. We performed mRNA sequencing to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the transition from laying to brooding and to detect difference in gene regulation underlying the phenotypic diversification using two chicken breeds. The majority of gene expression changes during phase transition were steroidogenesis and hormone-releasing genes. Brooding chickens shared a conservative pattern of greatly inhibited steroidogenic enzyme genes in the pituitary gland, therefore, low levels of steroidogenic enzymes might result in reproductive defects such as ovary regression and brooding onset. The conserved network responsible for brooding behavior was maintained by steroid biosynthesis and hormonal interactions. Interestingly, three transcription factors, SREBF2, NR5A1 and PGR, act as central signal modulators of steroid biosynthesis and hormonal interactions during the transition from laying to brooding modes at the molecular level. Furthermore, Genes correlated with protein synthesis and accumulation showed expression variation between breeds, which might result in different concentrations of and sensitivities to reproduction-related hormones. This study provided a new insight in neuroendocrine system at the molecular level, and helps to understand the genetic and hormonal responses that ultimately translate into behavior in chicken. ",

The main control employs segmented self-adaptive PI control strategy that can adjust control parameters in real time according to the changes of load and input voltages,to improve system's ability of disturbance rejection and speed up system's dynamic response. Auxiliary control introduces a novel start-up current peak suppression strategy,which,based on operating mode control to limit the maximum duty ratio to make the circuit operates in DCM,can suppress start-up current peak and at the same time can serve enough energy,and ensure a fast start-up of the system. The experiment results show that the digital PFC system under the testing environment with 110~230V input voltage and 140W maximum input power,the maximum PF value is 0.995 8 and the maximum efficiency is 95.68%. The start-up time is always less than 10 power frequency cycles during test and there is not voltage overshoot and start-up surge current. The maximum response time of load changing is 179ms,and the minimum 21ms. Voltage overshoot is 10%~20%.",

        "abstract": "Dropout is an effective regularization method for deep learning tasks. Several variants of dropout based on sampling with different distributions have been proposed individually and have shown good generalization performance on various learning tasks. Among these variants, the canonical Bernoulli dropout is a discrete method, while the uniform dropout and the Gaussian dropout are continuous dropout methods. When facing a new learning task, one must make a decision on which method is more suitable, which is somehow unnatural and inconvenient. In this paper, we attempt to change the selection problem to a parameter tuning problem by proposing a general form of dropout,    $beta $   -dropout, to unify the discrete dropout with continuous dropout. We show that by adjusting the shape parameter    $beta $   , the    $beta $   -dropout can yield the Bernoulli dropout, uniform dropout, and approximate Gaussian dropout. Furthermore, it can obtain continuous regularization strength, which paves the way for self-adaptive dropout regularization. As a first attempt, we propose a self-adaptive    $beta $   -dropout, in which the parameter    $beta $    is tuned automatically following a pre-designed strategy. The    $beta $   -dropout is tested extensively on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN, NORB, and ILSVRC-12 datasets to investigate its superior performance. The results show that the    $beta $   -dropout can conduct finer control of its regularization strength, therefore obtaining better performance.",

The translocated carbon-centered radicals, which are generated from the iminyl radicals through 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer or C-C cleavage, can be vinylated with vinyl boronic acids. This strategy opens up a new approach to remote functionalization via C(sp)-H and C-C cleavage and provides an efficient and versatile solution to the synthesis of \u03b3-vinylation of ketones and nitriles.",

More precisely, we construct the Newton stratification, Ekedahl-Oort stratification, and central leaves on the special fiber of a Shimura variety of abelian type at a good prime. We establish several basic properties of these stratifications, including the non-emptiness, closure relation and dimension formula, generalizing those previously known in the PEL and Hodge type cases. We also study the relations between these stratifications, both in general and in some special cases, such as those of fully Hodge-Newton decomposable type. We investigate the examples of quaternionic and orthogonal Shimura varieties in details.",

        "abstract": "The origin of nontreponemal antibodies during syphilis infection is hotly debated. Here, we analysed the immune response in rabbits immunized with various antigens. Inactivated treponemes elicited the production of low-titre nontreponemal antibodies in some rabbits. Cardiolipin combined with bovine serum albumin also induced anti-cardiolipin antibody production. These findings indicate that T. pallidum contained a cardiolipin antigen with weak immunogenicity. However, active T.pallidum induced higher nontreponemal antibody production with strong immunogenicity at an earlier time point, and the antibody titre was consecutive, suggesting the high nontreponemal antibody titre resulted from the combined effects of both the T. pallidum cardiolipin antigen and the damaged host-cell cardiolipin antigen during syphilis infection, the latter of which plays a major role in the induction of nontreponemal antibody production. Our study provides direct animal evidence of the origin of nontreponemal antibodies during T. pallidum infection.",

        "abstract": "Anticardiolipin antibody (ACA) includes beta2-glycoprotein I-dependent (\u03b22-GPI-dependent) and \u03b22-GPI-independent forms. The appearance of \u03b22-GPI-dependent ACA and its association with blood coagulation have never been investigated in subjects with classical biological false-positive syphilis reactions (CBFP). In total, 146 CBFP subjects, 465 syphilis patients and 64 presumed antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (pAPS) patients were enrolled, and \u03b22-GPI-dependent ACA IgA/IgG/IgM and anti-\u03b22-GPI IgA/IgG/IgM antibodies were detected via chemiluminescence assay. Conventional blood coagulation indices were measured to analyze their associations with these autoantibodies. In current study, the positive rate of \u03b22-GPI-dependent ACA in CBFP subjects was 22.60%, which was significantly higher than that in syphilis patients (3.87%) (P\u202f<\u202f0.001) and similar to that in pAPS patients (32.81%) (P\u202f=\u202f0.119). The predominant autoantibody isotypes were IgG in CBFP subjects and pAPS patients and IgM in syphilis patients. Positive autoantibody rates were independent of rapid plasma reagin titers. CBFP and pAPS subjects had longer prothrombin times (P\u202f<\u202f0.001) and activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs, P\u202f<\u202f0.001) but lower fibrinogen concentrations (P\u202f=\u202f0.022) and platelet counts (P\u202f<\u202f0.001) than syphilis patients. APTTs were prolonged in CBFP, syphilis and pAPS subjects with positive autoantibodies compared with those in subjects with negative autoantibodies (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). In conclusion, ACAs in CBFP and syphilis subjects are heterogeneous; \u03b22-GPI-dependent ACA constitutes a significant proportion of ACAs in CBFP subjects, while \u03b22-GPI-independent ACA predominates in syphilis patients. CBFP subjects are more prone to blood coagulation disorders than syphilis patients, and these autoantibodies may impact the intrinsic coagulation cascade in CBFP subjects, similar to pAPS patients.",

Hightened tension of spectrin was closely associated with the shrink tension transmitted synergistically by microfilaments (MFs) and microtubules (MTs). However, the increment of spectrin tension in pyroptotic cells was controlled antagonistically by MF and MT forces. Different from MF tension, outward MT forces participated in the formation of membrane blebs. Spectrin tension caused by inward MF forces resisted pyroptosis swelling. Stabilization of MF and MT structure had little influence on intracellular tension and pyroptosis deformation. Pyroptosis-induced cytoskeletal structural tension was highly dependent on calcium signaling and ROS generation. Blocking of membrane pores, non-selective ion flux, or elimination of caspase-1 cleavage resulted in the remission of structural forces associated with pyroptosis failure. Innovation and conclusions: The data suggest that subcellular tension, in-terms of magnitude and vector, is integral to pyroptosis through the mediation of swelling and blebbing and the elimination of structural tension, especially MT forces, may result in pyroptosis inhibition.",

        "abstract": "We have recently shown in rats that adolescent cocaine exposure induces prolonged modifications on synapses in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which might contribute to long-term behavioral outcomes in adulthood. In this study, we further investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying adolescent cocaine exposure-related psychiatric problems in adulthood, especially focusing on the alterations of GABAergic transmission in prelimbic cortex (PrL), 1 subregion of mPFC. Consistent with a previous study, adolescent cocaine-exposed mice exhibited enhanced anxiety-like behaviors in their adulthood. In the same mice models, depression-like behaviors increased as well, but the conditioned place preference formed normally. In parallel, activities of pyramidal neurons at layer V of PrL were reduced after adolescent cocaine exposure, accompanied by an increase in the percentage of symmetric synapses in PrL of adult mice. Additionally, miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents rather than miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents were increased on these pyramidal neurons, and increased levels of GABA were found in adult PrL. The molecules in the GABAergic system in adult PrL were also changed by adolescent cocaine use, as indicated by increased glutamate decarboxylase 67KD, GABA-\u03b11, and decreased GABA transporter 1. In the same mice, some regulators to GABAergic transmission such as neuregulin 1/ErbB4 signals were heightened as well. Collectively, these findings revealed that adolescent cocaine exposure results in permanent enhancement of GABAergic transmission on pyramidal neurons in PrL, which subsequently attenuate the activities of these neurons and ultimately contributes to the development of psychiatric disorders in later life.-Shi, P., Nie, J., Liu, H., Li, Y., Lu, X., Shen, X., Ge, F., Yuan, T.-F., Guan, X. Adolescent cocaine exposure enhances the GABAergic transmission in the prelimbic cortex of adult mice.",
