Serum levels of glycated albumin, adhesion molecules, endogenous secretory receptor of advanced glycation end products (esRAGE) and inflammatory factors were determined.Serum levels of GA, hsCRP, sVCAM-1, sICAM-1 and sE-selectin were increased, while esRAGE levels were decreased in diabetic patients than in non-diabetic patients (all P<0.001). These levels (except sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin) differed between Groups III and IV (all P<0.05). Moreover, GA levels correlated with sE-selectin and sICAM-1 concentrations (both P<0.05). Multivariable regression analysis revealed that male, hypertension, GA, hsCRP and sICAM-1 were independently associated with diffuse CAD in diabetic patients.This study addresses an association of increased GA, hsCRP and sICAM-1 levels with diffuse CAD in patients with T2DM.",

Echocardiography and DTI were performed before, 30 minutes, 90 minutes, and 4 weeks after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion.At baseline, LV end-diastolic volume and mass were greater in pigs with diabetes. After MI, LV ejection fractions and systolic mitral annular velocities were decreased and LV chambers dilated in both groups, which were exacerbated in animals with diabetes. At 30 minutes, 90 minutes, and 4 weeks after MI, strain rates were significantly lower in both infarct and noninfarct areas in the diabetic group than in controls.DTI proved to be a useful tool in the serial assessment of subclinical LV dysfunction after MI in pigs with diabetes.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to identify major proteins in the pathogenesis of coronary artery in-stent restenosis (ISR) in diabetic minipigs with sirolimus-eluting stenting, and to investigate the roles of key candidate molecules, particularly ADAM10, in human arterial smooth muscle cells (HASMCs).The stents were implanted in the coronary arteries of 15 diabetic and 26 non-diabetic minipigs, and angiography was repeated at six months. The intima of one vascular segment with significant ISR and one with non-ISR in diabetic minipigs were isolated and cultured in conditioned medium (CM). The CM was analyzed by LC-MS/MS to uncover proteins whose levels were significantly increased (\u2265 1.5-fold) in ISR than in non-ISR tissues. After literature searching, we focused on the identified proteins, whose biological functions were most potentially related to ISR pathophysiology. Among them, ADAM10 was significantly increased in diabetic and non-diabetic ISR tissues as compared with non-ISR controls. In cell experiments, retrovirus-mediated overexpression of ADAM10 promoted growth and migration of HASMCs. The effects of ADAM10 were more remarkable in high-glucose culture than in low-glucose culture. Using shRNA and an inhibitor of \u03b3-secretase (GSI), we found that the influences of ADAM10 were in part mediated by Notch1 and notch 3 pathway, which up-regulated Notch downstream genes and enhanced nuclear translocation of the small intracellular component of Notch1 and Notch3.This study has identified significantly increased expression of ADAM10 in the ISR versus non-ISR segment in diabetic minipigs and implicates ADAM10 in the enhanced neointimal formation observed in diabetes after vascular injury.",

        "abstract": "This cross-sectional study tested the hypothesis that increased serum level of high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1), a pro-inflammatory ligand of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), is associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) in nondiabetic and type 2 diabetic patients.Serum levels of HMGB1, endogenous secretory RAGE (esRAGE), soluble RAGE (sRAGE) and inflammatory cytokines were determined in 512 patients categorized as Group I (n=132, without diabetes and CAD), Group II (n=149, with CAD but no diabetes), Group III (n=80, with diabetes but no CAD) and Group IV (n=151, with diabetes and CAD).Serum levels of HMGB1 and hsCRP were higher in Group II than in Group I, and in Group IV than in Group III (all P<0.001). HMGB1 was positively related to hsCRP, TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels in the whole subjects (all P<0.01). Group II patients had lower sRAGE (P=0.058) and esRAGE (P<0.001) levels versus those in Group I. However, in the diabetic patients, those in Group IV had lower esRAGE (P<0.001) but higher sRAGE (P=0.002) levels compared to those in Group III. In multivariable regression analysis, HMGB1, esRAGE and conventional risk factors (age, smoking, hypertension, HDL-C, hsCRP, TNF-alpha) were independent determinants of CAD in nondiabetic patients. Moreover, HMGB1 and esRAGE consistently remained to be independently associated with CAD in diabetic patients, so did other major conventional risk factors.This study demonstrates that increased serum HMGB1 level is associated with CAD in nondiabetic and type 2 diabetic patients.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE-To investigate whether glycation level of apoprotein (apo)A-I is associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and plaque progression in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-Among 375 consecutive type 2 diabetic patients undergoing quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), 82 patients with nonsignificant stenosis (luminal diameter narrowing <30% [group I]) and 190 patients with significant CAD (luminal diameter stenosis \u226570% [group II]) were included for analysis of apoA-I glycation level and serum activity of lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). The control group had 136 healthy subjects. At the 1-year follow-up, angiography and IVUS were repeatedmainly in group II patients for plaque progression assessment. RESULTS-Relative intensity of apoA-I glycation by densitometry was increased, and serum LCAT activity was decreased stepwise across groups control, I, and II. These two measurements were associated with the number of diseased coronary arteries and extent index in group II. During 1-year follow-up, QCA detected 45 patients with plaque progression in 159 subjects, and IVUS found 38 patients with plaque progression in 127 subjects. Baseline relative intensity of apoA-I glycation was significantly increased in patients with plaque progression compared with those without, with values associated with changes in QCA and IVUS measurements. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that baseline relative intensity of apoA-I glycation was an independent determinant of CAD and plaque progression in type 2 diabetic patients. CONCLUSIONS-ApoA-I glycation level is associated with the severity of CAD and coronary artery plaque progression in type 2 diabetic patients. \u00a9 2013 by the American Diabetes Association.",

We sought to investigate the impact of early coronary collateralization, as evidenced by angiography, on myocardial reperfusion and outcomes after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).Acute procedural results, ST-segment resolution (STR), enzymatic infarct size, echocardiographic left ventricular function, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 6-month follow-up were assessed in 389 patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI for occluded IRA (TIMI flow grade 0 or 1) within 12 hours of symptom-onset. Angiographic coronary collateralization to the occluded IRA at first contrast injection was graded according to the Rentrop scoring system.Low (Rentrop score of 0 or 1) and high (Rentrop score of 2 or 3) coronary collateralization was detected in 329 and 60 patients, respectively. Patients with high collateralization more commonly had prior stable angina and right coronary artery occlusion, but less often had left anterior descending artery occlusion. At baseline, these patients presented with less extent of ST-segment elevation and lower serum levels of creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). Procedural success rate, STR, corrected TIMI flame count, and area under the curve of CK-MB and cTnI measurements after the procedure were similar between patients with high collateralization and those with low collateralization (for all comparisons P > 0.05). There were no differences in left ventricular ejection fraction and rates of MACE at 6 months according to baseline angiographic collaterals to occluded IRA.In patients with acute STEMI undergoing primary PCI within 12 hours of symptom-onset, coronary collateralization to the occluded IRA was influenced by clinical and angiographic features. Early recruitment of collaterals limits infarct size at baseline, but has no significant impact on myocardial reperfusion after the procedure and subsequent left ventricular function and clinical outcomes.",

        "abstract": "We sought to explore the association of variant rs1333049 on chromosome 9p21.3 with coronary artery disease (CAD) and angiographic plaque progression in non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic patients.Genotyping and quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) were performed in 2046 Chinese Han patients (1012 diabetic cases) undergoing coronary angiography; 430 of them received repeat angiographic studies at 1-year follow-up.CC genotype at rs1333049 on chromosome 9p21.3 was associated with CAD (unadjusted OR 1.524, p = 0.001 and adjusted OR 1.859, p = 0.005, respectively). However, CC genotype had no magnified association with CAD in diabetic patients (OR 1.275, p = 0.150) compared with non-diabetic counterparts (OR 1.446, p = 0.020) after adjusting for conventional risk factors. During angiographic follow-up, non-diabetic patients (n = 280) had significant decrease in minimal lumen diameter and increase in percent diameter stenosis among the three genotypes (p = 0.005 and p = 0.038, respectively), demonstrating that CC or GC genotype carriers had a more severe plaque progression than GG genotype carriers. In patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 150), although plaque progression was more severe than that in non-diabetic counterparts, no relations existed between plaque progression and genotypes. Rs1333049 was an independent determinant of plaque progression for non-diabetic (OR 3.468, p = 0.004 and OR 4.339, p = 0.002 for GC and CC genotype, respectively) but not for diabetic patients (OR 0.529, p = 0.077 and 0R 0.878, p = 0.644 for GC and CC genotype, respectively).This study demonstrates a significant association of homozygous CC genotype of rs1333049 on chromosome 9p21.3 with CAD in Chinese Han population. Rs1333049 polymorphism is an independent determinant for coronary plaque progression in non-diabetic but not in type 2 diabetic patients.",

        "abstract": "We investigated whether serum glycated albumin (GA) levels are related to coronary collateralization in type 2 diabetic patients with chronic total occlusion.Blood levels of GA and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were determined in 317 diabetic and 117 non-diabetic patients with stable angina and angiographic total occlusion of at least one major coronary artery. The degree of collaterals supplying the distal aspect of a total occlusion from the contra-lateral vessel was graded as low (Rentrop score of 0 or 1) or high collateralization (Rentrop score of 2 or 3).For diabetic patients, GA (21.2 \u00b1 6.5% vs. 18.7 \u00b1 5.6%, P < 0.001) but not HbA1c levels (7.0 \u00b1 1.1% vs. 6.8 \u00b1 1.3%, P = 0.27) was significantly elevated in low collateralization than in high collateralization group, and correlated inversely with Rentrop score (Spearmen's r = -0.28, P < 0.001; Spearmen's r = -0.10, P = 0.09, respectively). There was a trend towards a larger area under the curve of GA compared with that of HbA1c for detecting the presence of low collateralization (0.64 vs. 0.58, P = 0.15). In non-diabetic patients, both GA and HbA1c levels did not significantly differ regardless the status of coronary collateralization. In multivariable analysis, female gender, age > 65 years, smoke, non-hypertension, duration of diabetes > 10 years, metabolic syndrome, eGFR < 90 ml/min/1.73 m2, and GA > 18.3% were independently determinants for low collateralization in diabetic patients.Increased GA levels in serum are associated with impaired collateral growth in type 2 diabetic patients with stable angina and chronic total occlusion.",

        "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory process due to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) accumulation in macrophages. We investigated the involvement of microRNAs in oxLDL accumulation and inflammatory response in macrophages. The expression of miR-146a decreases under oxLDL stimulation. MiR-146a significantly reduces intracellular LDL cholesterol content and secretion of interleukin 6, interleukin 8, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 and matrix metallopeptidase 9. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a relevant target of miR-146a, and miR-146a inhibits the activation of TLR4-dependent intracellular signaling pathways involved in cytoskeleton rearrangement, lipid uptake, and inflammatory cytokine secretion. These results indicate that miR-146a contributes to the regulation of both oxLDL accumulation and inflammatory response by negatively regulating TLR4 and thereby inhibiting the activation of TLR4-dependent signaling pathways. Over-expression of miR-146a may be useful in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.",

        "abstract": "Observational clinical studies have shown that patients with diabetes have less favorable results after percutaneous coronary intervention compared with the non-diabetic counterparts, but its mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the changes of neointimal hyperplasia after sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) implantation in a diabetic porcine model, and to evaluate the impact of aortic inflammation on this proliferative process.Diabetic porcine model was created with an intravenous administration of a single dose of streptozotocin in 15 Chinese Guizhou minipigs (diabetic group); each of them received 2 SES (Firebird, Microport Co, China) implanted into 2 separated major epicardial coronary arteries. Fifteen non-diabetic minipigs with SES implantation served as controls (control group). At 6 months, the degree of neointimal hyperplasia was determined by repeat coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and histological examination. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha protein level in the aortic intima was evaluated by Western blotting, and TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 mRNA levels were assayed by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction.The distribution of stented vessels, diameter of reference vessels, and post-procedural minimal lumen diameter were comparable between the two groups. At 6-month follow-up, the degree of in-stent restenosis (40.4 +/- 24.0% vs. 20.2 +/- 17.7%, p < 0.05), late lumen loss (0.33 +/- 0.19 mm vs. 0.10 +/- 0.09 mm, p < 0.001) by quantitative angiography, percentage of intimal hyperplasia in the stented area (26.7 +/- 19.2% vs. 7.3 +/- 6.1%, p < 0.001) by IVUS, and neointimal area (1.59 +/- 0.76 mm2 vs. 0.41 +/- 0.18 mm2, p < 0.05) by histological examination were significantly exacerbated in the diabetic group than those in the controls. Significant increases in TNF-alpha protein and TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 mRNA levels were observed in aortic intima in the diabetic group.Neointimal hyperplasia persisted at least up to 6 months after SES implantation in diabetic porcine, which may be partly related to an exaggerated inflammatory response within the blood vessel wall. Our results provide theoretical support for potential direct beneficial effects of anti-diabetic and anti-inflammation medications in reducing the risk of restenosis after stenting.",

        "abstract": "We aimed to uncover the protein changes of coronary artery in-stent restenosis (ISR) tissue in minipigs with and without streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus by quantitative 2-dimensional fluorescence in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), and to investigate the influences of crucial proteins identified, particularly adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (AFABP), in human arterial smooth muscle cells.Sirolimus-eluting stents were implanted in the coronary arteries of 15 diabetic and 26 nondiabetic minipigs, and angiography was repeated after 6 months. The intima tissue of significant ISR and non-ISR segments in both diabetic and nondiabetic minipigs was analyzed by 2D-DIGE and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. AFABP level was significantly increased in ISR tissue than in non-ISR tissue in both diabetic and nondiabetic minipigs, with level being higher in diabetic ISR than in nondiabetic ISR tissue. In human arterial smooth muscle cells, overexpression of AFABP significantly altered phenotype and promoted growth and migration, with effects more prominent in high-glucose than in low-glucose medium, whereas AFABP knockdown inhibited these effects. AFABP overexpression increased reactive oxygen species production by upregulating the expression of NADPH oxidase subunits Nox1, Nox4, and P22 through multiple pathways, with elevation of downstream gene cyclin D1, matrix metalloproteinase-2, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. However, AFABP-induced effects were inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium, pathway inhibitors, and small interfering RNA. In addition, the supernatant from AFABP-expressing human arterial smooth muscle cells and recombinant AFABP also promoted cellular growth and migration.This study has demonstrated that AFABP is significantly increased in coronary artery ISR segments of both diabetic and nondiabetic minipigs. Increased AFABP expression and secretory AFABP of human arterial smooth muscle cells promote growth and migration via reactive oxygen species-mediated activation.",

Eighty-two patients without ST randomly selected from the same study period served as controls.Serum levels of vWF, sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1 were significantly increased in patients with ST than in controls (all P<0.01). No significant difference was observed in the genotype and allele distribution of the vWF, t-PA and PAI-1 gene polymorphisms. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that vWF, sVCAM-1, discontinuation of clopidogrel therapy and left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 50% were independent determinants of late ST.Increased serum vWF and sVCAM-1 levels are associated with late ST, suggesting that endothelial dysfunction contributes to the development of late or very late ST.",

One hundred fifty-two normal subjects were served as controls. Serum concentrations of GA and esRAGE were measured, and RAGE polymorphisms (-374T>A, -429T>C and G82S) were analyzed.Serum GA concentration was higher and, in contrast, esRAGE concentration was lower in Group III than in the other groups (P<0.05). These two protein concentrations correlated closely with loss index (all P<0.01), and were independent risk factors for ISR in diabetic patients (P=0.01 and P=0.025, respectively). However, there were no differences in the allele and genotype frequencies in the 3 polymorphisms of RAGE gene between groups.Increased GA and decreased esRAGE concentrations, but not -374T>A, -429T>C and Gly82Ser polymorphisms of RAGE gene, are associated with ISR in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to assess possible associations between osteopontin (OPN), and thrombin-cleaved (N-half) OPN, and nephropathy and coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Plasma levels of OPN, N-half OPN, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were determined in 301 diabetic patients with (n = 226) or without (n = 75) angiographically documented CAD (luminal diameter narrowing >50%), as well as in 75 non-diabetic controls with normal angiography. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated in all patients.Plasma levels of OPN and hsCRP were significantly higher in patients with T2DM compared with controls. In addition, there was a higher occurrence of moderate renal insufficiency and lower eGFR in patients with T2DM (all P < 0.01). T2DM patients in whom OPN levels were greater than the median value had higher serum creatinine levels, a greater prevalence of mild or moderate renal insufficiency, a higher incidence of CAD, and lower eGFR (all P < 0.05) than T2DM patients in whom OPN levels were the same as or lower than the median value. However, there were no differences in these parameters when patients were stratified according to plasma N-half OPN levels. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between OPN, but not N-half OPN, and the severity of nephropathy and CAD in diabetes. After adjustment for potential confounders and treatments, multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated an independent association between OPN, but not N-half OPN, and eGFR. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that higher OPN levels conferred a fourfold greater risk of renal insufficiency and CAD in patients with T2DM.The results of the present study demonstrate that there is an independent association between plasma levels of OPN, but not N-half OPN, and the presence and severity of nephropathy and CAD in diabetes.",

Method: Serum levels of S100B, TNF-\u03b1, high sensitivity CRP and NT-proBNP were determined in CHF patients with (n = 96) and without RI (n = 146). Patients with RI only (n = 62) and control subjects (n = 64) served for comparison. Patients were followed up for one year. Results: S100B levels were higher in CHF patients with a further elevation in those with RI (P. <. 0.01). Serum S100B levels correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular end-diastolic volume and NT-proBNP in CHF patients, and eGFR in patients with RI (all P. <. 0.05). Increased S100B levels were associated with major cardiac events (MCE), and were independently associated with the presence of CHF (all P. <. 0.05). Conclusion: Increased serum S100B levels were associated with the severity of cardiac dysfunction, RI and an adverse prognosis in CHF patients. It represents an independent risk factor for CHF. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": " Chronic inflammatory disorders and dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are essential contributors to the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Monocyte to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio (MHR) is a novel and simple measure associated positively with the body inflammatory and oxidative stress status. However, little is known regarding the role of MHR in evaluating carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), a surrogate predictor of subsequent vascular events, especially in diabetic patients.  A total of 494 patients with T2DM and 1,848 non-diabetic subjects were consecutively enrolled in study 1. Correlation between MHR and CIMT was compared between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. In study 2, a total of 110 T2DM patients from study 1 with normal basal CIMT and a follow-up ultrasonography at 12 months were enrolled. The predictive role of MHR on CIMT progression in diabetic patients was analyzed.  In study 1, MHR was higher in patients with T2DM than non-diabetic subjects ( < 0.001). After adjustment for confounding risk factors, MHR remained correlated significantly with CIMT in diabetic ( = 0.172,  = 0.001) but not non-diabetic ( = 0.006,  = 0.813) subjects. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that MHR is superior to traditional lipid parameters in association with elevated CIMT in diabetic patients. In study 2, MHR at baseline was positively correlated with change in CIMT ( = 0.313,  = 0.001). Basal MHR was independently associated with change in CIMT [\u03b2 = 0.059, (95% CI: 0.012-0.105),  = 0.014] in multivariate linear regression analysis.  Our study suggests that MHR is a convenient and effective measure in prediction of the presence and progression of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis in patients with T2DM.",

        "abstract": "Patients afflicted with chronic kidney disease (CKD) typically suffer from cardiovascular disease (CVD) which is a leading cause of patient mortality. It has been demonstrated that two distinct physiological events contribute to this disease state. These include the abundance of abnormally high levels of protein-bound uraemic toxins as well as functionally aberrant endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Specifically, it has been demonstrated that the uraemic toxin p-cresol (pC; 4-methylphenol) inhibits EPC proliferation and tube formation in previous in vitro studies. More recently, however, it has been demonstrated that circulating pC is actually conjugated and that p-cresylsulphate (pCS) is its main metabolite. Therefore, within the context of this study, we examined the in vitro effects of pC and pCS treatment on cultured human EPCs.Late-outgrowth EPCs were treated with physiological concentrations of pC or pCS (10, 40, 80, and 160 or 10, 40, 80, 160 and 320 \u00b5g/mL for up to 72 h, respectively) in the presence of 4% human serum albumin (HSA). Cell proliferation was determined using WST-1 assay, while migration and tube formation assays were used to evaluate EPC function in vitro. Cell cycle analyses were also performed to determine the effects of pC and pCS on cell cycle status.With regard to EPC proliferation, data demonstrate that pC in the presence or absence of HSA had an IC50 of 80.1 and 100.8 \u00b5g/mL 72 h post-treatment, respectively, while pCS-treated groups did not impair EPC proliferation. Similarly, pC-treated groups showed limited vessel formation and migration compared with controls and no detrimental effects were seen with pCS treatment. Lastly, pC treatment of EPCs caused cells to accumulate in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle with accompanied down-regulation of cyclin B1 and phosphorylated CDK1. pCS had no effect on cell cycle parameters.Our data demonstrate that pC and pCS have different effects on EPC function. Since there is a dearth of data that have focused on the toxicity of pCS, further research should be performed to determine the exact biological toxicity of pCS on the cardiovascular system.",

Unstable plaques consequently rupture, leading to lethal cardiac events [1] . Diabetes is associated with intensified vascular inflammation and oxidative stress, which accelerate the development of atherosclerotic lesions [2] . Diabetic patients have an increased incidence of cardiovascular events and less favorable outcomes after myocardial infarction or coronary interventions [3,4] . One important mechanism of diabetic vascular complications is that advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) produced in hyperglycemic milieu exert adverse impact on vascular function, via receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) [5,6] . Activation of RAGE-mediated pathways leads to impaired vascular homeostasis, enhanced inflammatory signalings and increased cellular oxidative stress [7] , jointly contributing to atherosclerotic lesion progression [8,9] . Interference of AGEs' engagement to their receptor was achieved by administration of soluble forms of the receptor (sRAGE), which resulted in attenuated progression of established atherosclerosis in animal models [8] . Total sRAGE is a pool of RAGE variants, mainly composed of endogenous secretory forms (esRAGE) lacking transmembrane domain of the receptor, and proteolytically cleaved RAGE (c-RAGE) shed into the bloodstream upon by metalloproteinase action [10\u201312] . Both esRAGE and c-RAGE function as a decoy for AGEs, thus protecting vessel tissue from AGEs-induced pathology and mitigating development of atherosclerotic lesions. Nevertheless, the results of serum sRAGE levels in diabetic patients with vascular and target organ complications have not been replicated. Recent studies suggested that sRAGE was increased in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease [13] , while Yamasaki et al. reported an association of low sRAGE levels with progression of carotid intima-media thickness in diabetes mellitus [14] . Other studies including ours consistently indicated that esRAGE level was reduced in diabetic patients with vascular complications compared with those without [13\u201319] . Thus, in this study, we hypothesized that decreased serum esRAGE level may be associated with coronary plaque progression in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Since previous studies revealed a relationship between elevated inflammatory cytokines and plaque progression [20,21] , we also hypothesized that higher C-reactive protein level was related to plaque progression and correlated inversely with esRAGE concentration. Methods Study population The study protocol was approved by hospital Ethics Committee. Following institutional review, written informed consent from the patients was waived, as there were no experimental interventions, and patient confidentiality was guaranteed by the study protocol. Study participants were recruited from Shanghai Rui Jin Hospital Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) Outcomes Program. Briefly, this program utilized clinical and angiographic information for various cardiovascular diseases to estimate risk-adjusted outcomes. Data on patient demographics, clinical and angiographic features, and in-hospital management were collected retrospectively, whereas clinical outcomes during long-term follow-up were identified prospectively. A total of 576 consecutive patients with coronary artery disease underwent drug-eluting stent based PCI between October 2004 and December 2005. Excluded from the study were patients with acute myocardial infarction (56 patients), severe heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction < 30% (25 patients), renal failure requiring dialysis (4 patients), type 1 diabetes and serious life-threatening illnesses or inflammation (21 patients). For the purpose of this study, patients who died (8 patients) or had no knowledge of repeat angiography during follow-up (169 patients), and loss to follow-up (13 patients) were also excluded from analysis. Another 15 patients were not included in this study because of symptom-driven repeat intervention or acute myocardial infarction undergoing primary PCI within 6\u00a0months of initial examination. The remaining 265 patients formed the study population, who had at least 1 stenotic lesion (luminal diameter narrowing > 20%) located at non-PCI intervened vessels on baseline coronary angiograms and received follow-up angiography at one year. Biochemical assessments Blood samples were collected after overnight fasting and stored at \u2212 80\u00a0\u00b0C. White blood cell count and serum levels of glucose and lipid profiles (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], lipoprotein (a), apoprotein A and B, and triglycerides) were measured (HITACHI 912 Analyser, Roche Diagnostics, Germany). High sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (Biocheck Laboratories, USA) and esRAGE (Phoenix Biotech Co, LTD, USA) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). esRAGE ELISA kit specifically measures endogenous secretory RAGE, but not c-RAGE, as detailed in protocol provided by the manufacturer. The linear range of the measurement for esRAGE and hsCRP were 0.05\u20133.2\u00a0ng/mL and 0.62\u2013119.3\u00a0mg/L, respectively, and interassay coefficient of variation for esRAGE and hsCRP were < 10% and < 7.5%, respectively. Changes of biochemical measurements were defined as baseline measurement minus follow-up measurement. Coronary angiography and quantitative analysis Coronary arteriography and interventional procedures were performed by standard Judkins techniques or through radial approach [22] . Intracoronary injection of nitroglycerin (100\u00a0\u03bcg) was routinely made to avoid artery spasm. Coronary angiograms recorded at identical projections during initial and follow-up studies were used for quantitative coronary analyses (QCA, Centricity Cardiology CA 1000. v1.0, USA). All imaging analyses were performed by 2 experienced interventional cardiologists, who were blind to patients' clinical data. Severity of coronary atherosclerosis was defined according to number of coronary vessels with significant stenosis (angiographic luminal stenosis > 50%) as one-, two-, or three-vessel disease. For lesion analysis, end-diastolic frames from both baseline and follow-up angiograms were selected with identical angulations that best showed the stenosis at its most severe degree with minimal foreshortening and branch overlap. Matching arterial segments were defined from the images acquired on the basis of the anatomic location of proximal and distal side branches. The coronary artery segments analyzed included all those plaques with a reference diameter \u2265 1.5\u00a0mm and a stenosis \u2265 20% at baseline and those with new lesions at follow-up in non-PCI artery. All coronary arteries intervened with PCI were excluded to avoid inclusion of post-PCI neointimal hyperplasia or restenosis. Using the outer diameter of the contrast-filled catheter as the calibration, the minimal lumen diameter (MLD) in diastole was measured from multiple projection; the results from the single \u201cworst\u201d view were recorded. The reference segment diameter was averaged from user-defined, 5-mm-long, angiographically normal segments proximal and distal to the lesion but between any major side branches. Atherosclerotic plaque progression was defined as \u2265 1 lesion with decreased MLD \u2265 0.4\u00a0mm from baseline to follow-up angiography, a change representing approximately twice the SD for repeat measurements for lesions [23] . A new coronary lesion was defined as a stenosis that was not apparent on the initial angiogram or was < 20% in diameter stenosis but that narrowed by \u2265 0.4\u00a0mm in MLD at the follow-up angiogram [24] . Coronary artery score was calculated from per-patient average of the MLD of all the measured segments in observed coronary artery, and cumulative coronary obstruction was the sum of all percent diameter stenoses in standard index unit (50% = 0.50) [25] . Change of QCA measurements was defined as baseline QCA measurement minus follow-up measurement. Follow-up All patients were followed up in a special outpatient clinic or by telephone conversation with patients or their family members every 3\u00a0months after initial angiography. During follow-up, the emphasis was on symptoms and signs related to major adverse cardiac events (MACE), such as chest pain, unexplained dyspnea and mental disorder. MACE included non-fatal myocardial infarction and revascularization (repeat PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting). Myocardial infarction was defined according to the criteria of American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology. In order to guarantee rigorous data quality, all MACE were reviewed by 2 experienced interventional cardiologists. The choice of repeat PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting was at physician's discretion. Statistical analysis Continuous variables were expressed as mean \u00b1 SD, and categorical variables were presented as frequencies. Normal distribution was evaluated with Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. Logarithmic transformation was performed on the continuous variables of non-normal distribution before statistical calculations that requested normal distribution. Comparisons between groups were made using unpaired t tests, ANOVA or a nonparametric Mann\u2013Whitney U test, when appropriate. Comparisons between baseline and follow-up measurements were performed with paired t tests, and qualitative variables were compared using Chi-square test. Pearson's correlations were used to test the relationship between continuous variables (e.g., esRAGE) and change of QCA measurements. Multivariate logistic regression model was constructed to assess the independent determinants of plaque progression. A 2-sided probability level of \u2264 0.05 was considered significant. All analyses were done with SPSS for Windows 13.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). Results Clinical characteristics There were 152 nondiabetic and 113 diabetic patients, and plaque progression occurred in 42 (27.6%) nondiabetic and 42 (37.2%) diabetic patients. Patients with plaque progression did not differ significantly from those without plaque progression with respect to age, gender, cigarette smoking, systolic blood pressure, follow-up time, and medical treatments, but hypertension was more prevalent and duration of diabetes was longer in patients with plaque progression than in those without ( Table 1 ). Angiographic features Both diabetic and nondiabetic patients with plaque progression had more marked changes in MLD, coronary artery score and cumulative coronary obstruction, compared to those without (all p < 0.001) ( Table 2 ). In nondiabetic patients, the number of patients with plaque progression occurred at left anterior descending artery, left circumflex artery and right coronary artery was 11 (26.2%), 15 (35.7%), and 16 (38.1%), respectively. Repeat PCI was performed in 5 patients (11.9%) because of plaque progression. In diabetic group, plaque progression developed at left anterior descending artery, left circumflex artery, and right coronary artery in 12 (28.6%), 9 (21.4%), and 20 (47.6%) patients, respectively. Ten patients required repeat PCI for plaque progression. New coronary lesions occurred in 5 nondiabetic and 8 diabetic patients ( p = 0.720). Biochemical measurements The changes of biochemical measurements over 1-year follow-up were displayed in Table 3 . Serum cholesterol and apoprotein B were significantly reduced in all diabetic and nondiabetic patients with or without plaque progression (all p < 0.05). Triglyceride and LDL-C levels were decreased in diabetic and nondiabetic patients, respectively (all p < 0.05). Serum HDL-C was lower (1.05 \u00b1 0.27\u00a0mmol/L vs. 1.20 \u00b1 0.28\u00a0mmol/L) but lipoprotein (a) was higher (0.29 \u00b1 0.18\u00a0g/L vs. 0.23 \u00b1 0.16\u00a0g/L) at baseline in nondiabetic patients with plaque progression than in those without. These measurements did not change obviously in nondiabetic patients at follow-up. Fast glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin A1c levels did not differ significantly at follow-up in diabetic patients with or without plaque progression. White blood cell and neutrophile counts were decreased in nondiabetic and diabetic patients without plaque progression during follow-up (all p < 0.05) ( Table 3 ). Serum hsCRP level HsCRP level was higher in patients with plaque progression than those without at baseline irrespective of the presence or absence of diabetes ( Fig. 1 ). During follow-up, although serum hsCRP level was significantly decreased in nondiabetic patients with (from 20.77 \u00b1 12.67\u00a0mg/L to 7.95 \u00b1 4.57\u00a0mg/L, p < 0.001) or without plaque progression (from 9.87 \u00b1 7.06\u00a0mg/L to 7.02 \u00b1 4.88\u00a0mg/L, p < 0.001) compared with baseline, it was still higher in those with plaque progression (7.92 \u00b1 4.40\u00a0mg/L vs. 6.85 \u00b1 4.76\u00a0mg/L, p = 0.040). For diabetic patients, hsCRP level was also significantly reduced in those with (18.52 \u00b1 14.80\u00a0mg/L to 9.13 \u00b1 4.82\u00a0mg/L, p < 0.05) and without plaque progression (12.87 \u00b1 9.13\u00a0mg/L to 8.81 \u00b1 5.78\u00a0mg/L, p < 0.01) compared with baseline, and the difference in hsCRP between diabetic patients with and without plaque progression at follow-up did not reach statistically significant level. Serum esRAGE level Serum esRAGE level was significantly lower in diabetic patients, compared with nondiabetic counterparts (0.31 \u00b1 0.16\u00a0ng/mL vs. 0.37 \u00b1 0.14\u00a0ng/mL, p = 0.003) ( Fig. 2 ). For nondiabetic patients, esRAGE level was increased in those without plaque progression (from 0.36 \u00b1 0.14\u00a0ng/mL to 0.40 \u00b1 0.13\u00a0ng/mL, p = 0.014) at follow-up, but was unchanged in those with plaque progression. For diabetic patients, esRAGE level was unchanged in those with no plaque progression, but was decreased in those with plaque progression (from 0.32 \u00b1 0.15\u00a0ng/mL to 0.25 \u00b1 0.12\u00a0ng/mL, p = 0.011) at follow-up. This resulted in a marked difference in follow-up esRAGE level between patients with plaque progression and those without plaque progression in diabetic patients (0.25 \u00b1 0.12\u00a0ng/mL vs. 0.34 \u00b1 0.17\u00a0ng/mL, p = 0.002). Relation of serum esRAGE and hsCRP levels, and other risk factors to plaque progression Significant correlation was observed between change of esRAGE and changes of MLD, coronary artery score and cumulative coronary obstruction in nondiabetic ( r = 0.313, p < 0.001; r = 0.421, p < 0.001; r = 0.285, p < 0.01, respectively) and diabetic patients ( r = 0.231, p = 0.014; r = 0.362, p < 0.001; r = 0.355, p < 0.001, respectively). Multivariable logistics regression analysis, including conventional risk factors and measurements here performed ( Tables 1 and 3 ), revealed that HDL-C (OR = 0.214, p = 0.037), hypertension (OR = 2.755, p = 0.011), baseline hsCRP (OR = 1.083, p < 0.001), and change of esRAGE (OR = 23.477, p < 0.001) were risk factors for plaque progression ( Table 4 ). Predicted percentage correct of this regression model was 74.0%. Nagelkerke R 2 value was 0.279, suggesting the model explained 27.9% of the variation in the dependent variable. Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test was used to check the models' goodness of fit and the results demonstrated a good fit achieved (goodness of fit: Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow \u03c7 2 = 5.860, d.f. = 8, p = 0.663). Notably, although some factors (hypertension and duration of diabetes) were not equally distributed across groups at baseline ( Table 1 ), difference in esRAGE and hsCRP levels remained significant after adjusting potential confounders with a logistic regression model. Follow-up data There was no significant difference in rate of acute myocardial infarction between patients with plaque progression and those without in diabetic or nondiabetic groups after enrollment. However, the incidence of combined MACE during follow-up was significantly higher in diabetic patients with plaque progression than in those without (38.1% vs. 14.1%, p = 0.003) ( Table 1 ). Discussion This study demonstrated that decreased esRAGE and increased hsCRP levels were associated with coronary plaque progression over one-year period in patients with T2DM. Evidence suggested that esRAGE exerted an antagonizing effect on RAGE-mediated pro-atherogenic pathophysiology [26,27] . Recent studies showed that low circulatory esRAGE levels were associated with diabetes and diabetic vasculopathies including carotid intima-media thickness, a marker of atherosclerosis progression [15\u201318] . In this study, esRAGE level was significantly decreased in diabetic patients with plaque progression versus those without, and elevated in nondiabetic patients without plaque progression. These results indicate that a more aggravated atherogenic pathophysiology is implicated in patients with plaque progression reflected by their lower esRAGE levels. An increased esRAGE level heightened the protective effect on vessels, while a reduced esRAGE level was associated with accelerated atherosclerotic process. In addition, our results also showed that baseline hsCRP level was higher in patients with plaque progression than in those without for nondiabetes or diabetes, which supported the concept that an intensified inflammatory process played a central role in the acceleration of atherosclerosis, and \u201cactive\u201d coronary event was associated with an increased level of acute-phase reactant and monocyte activation [28,29] . We observed an inverse relation between baseline esRAGE and hsCRP in diabetic patients, which was consistent with previous reports in healthy people [30] , but we did not find similar phenomenon in nondiabetic group. One explanation for this disparity was that almost all patients in this study received aggressive medical treatment, which altered serum levels of inflammatory cytokines [31] . On the other hand, esRAGE levels reflected the pathology of diabetic vasculopathies where RAGE expression was substantially up-regulated, leading to activation of inflammatory cytokine-producing pathways [32] . Thus, more associative effect appeared between esRAGE and hsCRP levels. Taken together, our findings supported a notion that intensified inflammatory process (reflected by elevated hsCRP level) and/or attenuated protective factors (partially reflected by reduced esRAGE level) were associated with plaque progression, particularly in diabetic patients. Thus, inhibition of inflammation and improvement of vascular protective factors were allegedly capable of mitigating atherosclerosis progression. Prevention of atherosclerosis progression and reduction of risk factors independently correlated with less clinical events in patients with coronary artery disease [33] . Putting it in perspective, medical therapy including statins and lifestyle changes may decrease inflammatory process and increase esRAGE level, especially for patients with diabetes. This study has several limitations. First, the sample size was small and the observation period was relatively short. Second, this study did not assess plaque progression or composition with intravascular ultrasound. Angiographic detection of atherosclerosis was confounded by a phenomenon known as the Glagov hypothesis or arterial remodeling [34,35] . As coronary plaques evolved, the external elastic membrane may gradually remodel in an outward direction. Accordingly, early alteration in atherosclerotic plaque may be not detectable by angiogram until the disease had advanced significantly. Third, treating patients to increase esRAGE and decrease inflammation with statins would be a way forward for patient health, and change in lifestyles secondary to getting the patients to eat healthily and exercise would correct many biochemical imbalances [17] . Finally, coronary compensatory remodeling was impaired in diabetic state [36,37] , thus, making judgments for diabetic lesion was more confident than nondiabetes in the present study. In summary, this study demonstrated an association of decreased serum esRAGE level with angiographically determined coronary plaque progression in patients with T2DM. Fully characterization of protective function of esRAGE for plaque progression in T2DM patients needed serial observation during long-term follow-up. References [1] R.

        "abstract": "No randomized trial has been performed to compare the efficacy of an intracoronary bolus of tirofiban versus urokinase during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We investigated whether the effects of adjunctive therapy with an intracoronary bolus of urokinase was noninferior to the effects of an intracoronary bolus of tirofiban in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing PCI.A total of 490 patients with acute STEMI undergoing primary PCI were randomized to an intracoronary bolus of tirofiban (10 \u00b5g/kg; n = 247) or urokinase (250 kU/20 ml; n = 243). Serum levels of P-selectin, von Willebrand factor (vWF), CD40 ligand (CD40L), and serum amyloid A (SAA) in the coronary sinus were measured before and after intracoronary drug administration. The primary endpoint was the rate of complete ( \u2265 70%) ST-segment resolution (STR) at 90 minutes after intervention, and the noninferiority margin was set to 15%.In the intention-to-treat analysis, complete STR was achieved in 54.4% of patients treated with an intracoronary bolus of urokinase and in 60.6% of those treated with an intracoronary bolus of tirofiban (adjusted difference: -7.0%; 95% confidence interval: -15.7% to 1.8%). The corrected TIMI frame count of the infarct-related artery was lower, left ventricular ejection fraction was higher, and the 6-month major adverse cardiac event-free survival tended to be better in the intracoronary tirofiban group. An intracoronary bolus of tirofiban resulted in lower levels of P-selectin, vWF, CD40L, and SAA in the coronary sinus compared with an intracoronary bolus of urokinase after primary PCI (P < 0.05).An intracoronary bolus of urokinase as an adjunct to primary PCI for acute STEMI is not equally effective to an intracoronary bolus of tirofiban with respect to improvement in myocardial reperfusion assessed by STR. This may be caused by less reduction in coronary circulatory platelet activation and inflammation.",

MSCs have a potential role in cell replacement therapy in acute myocardial infarction and ischemic cardiomyopathy. However, mechanisms of AGEs on MSCs are still not unveiled.Reactive oxygen species (ROS), genes regulation, cell proliferation and migration have been detected by AGE-BSA stimulated MSCs.We found that in vitro stimulation with AGE-BSA induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and inhibited dose-dependently proliferation and migration of MSCs. Microarray and molecular biological assessment displayed an increased expression and secretion of Ccl2, Ccl3, Ccl4 and Il1b in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These chemokines/cytokines of equivalent concentration to those in conditioned medium exerted an inhibitory effect on MSC proliferation and migration after stimulation for 24 h. Transient elevation of phospho-p38 in MSCs upon AGE-BSA stimulation was blocked with p38 inhibitor.The study indicates that AGE-BSA induces production of chemokines/cytokines in a dose- and time-dependent manner via activation of ROS-p38 mediated pathway. These chemokines/cytokines exert an inhibitory effect on MSC growth and migration, suggesting an amplified dysfunction of MSCs by AGEs.",

        "abstract": "Drug-eluting stents have demonstrated a substantial reduction of restenosis and currently are gaining a leading position in the intervention field. Triptolide, a purified extract from Chinese herb medicine Tripterygium wilfordii hook F, exhibits antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic function in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we investigated effects of triptolide on in-stent restenosis in vivo and in vitro, and study the biological mechanism of this drug.Rat aortic smooth muscle cells were cultured and treated with different concentration of triptolide (0, 1, 10, and 50nM). For cell viability, we used trypan blue exclusion (TBE) survival assay. Flow cytometry was used to study the influence of triptolide on VSMCs cell cycle. Signal proteins were detected by western blotting analysis. Triptolide coated stents had been implanted in the iliac arteries of New Zealand rabbits. After 4weeks, the stented iliac artery segments were processed for embedding, staining and histomorphometric analysis.Triptolide of concentration 10nM, 50nM significantly inhibited fetal calf serum-induced VSMC proliferation (p<0.05). The accumulation of triptolide-treated cells at the G1/S-interphase was dose dependent. Triptolide completely blocked the cell cycle progression at 50nM. Western blotting analysis showed decreased ERK1/2 MAP kinase phosphorylation level, significantly increased p21(cip1) expression and reduced retinoblastoma protein (pRb) phosphorylation after 24h of triptolide treatment. 4weeks after the surgery, the arterial wall morphology was shown that triptolide-coated stent has less neointimal vs bare metal stent.Our study indicates that triptolide exert inhibitory effect on VSMC proliferation, inactivation of MAPK pathway and modulation of cell cycle proteins p21(cip1) and Rb are relating mechanisms. Triptolide drug-eluting stents attenuated neointimal formation after stent implantation in rabbit vessel. We believe that triptolide may potentially be useful in treating cardiovascular restenosis after PCI.",

        "abstract": "Mounting data have emerged suggesting that the Connexin37 C1019T polymorphism increases susceptibility to coronary artery disease (CAD). However, previous studies yielded conflicting results. In the current study, a comprehensive meta-analysis was performed to investigate whether the C1019T polymorphism is associated with CAD risk.A total of 11 studies examining the C1019T polymorphism and CAD were identified using MEDLINE, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang and CBM, in which 5535 CAD patients and 5626 controls were analyzed. A random-effects model was used to calculate odd ratios and confidence intervals, while addressing between-study heterogeneity. Publication bias was weighed using the Egger's test, Begg-Mazemdar test and funnel plot.In genetic models with striking heterogeneity, the risk of CAD was not associated with the C1019T polymorphism (allele comparison: p = 0.34, OR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.90-1.36). Stratification by disease endpoints indicated that the 1019T allele was significantly associated with myocardial infarction (MI) (allele comparison: p <0.001, OR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.24-2.03). Further meta-regression analysis indicated that a large proportion of heterogeneity was probably due to the varying proportions of diabetes mellitus (DM) across studies (p = 0.014).Our results indicated that the C1019T polymorphism may be a moderate risk factor for MI and that DM was likely a potential source of between-study heterogeneity.",

        "abstract": "YKL-40 is a pro-inflammatory protein highly expressed in atherosclerotic plaques, and is related to prognosis of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). This study aimed to assess the possible association between YKL-40 and coronary lesion progression in CAD patients.A total of 313 patients with CAD, who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and follow-up angiography (mean 13.2+/-3.2 months) were recruited. Serum YKL-40 and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels were measured using ELISA kits.Baseline serum YKL-40 and hsCRP levels were higher in those with lesion progression (all p<0.001 vs. patients without lesion progression), and correlated significantly with change of lumen diameter stenosis and cumulative coronary obstruction score (all p<0.01). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that after adjusting for conventional risk factors, number of total coronary artery lesions, YKL-40 and hsCRP levels were independent determinants of lesion progression. An area under the curve of YKL-40 and hsCRP was 0.744 (CI 95% 0.685-0.804, p<0.001) and 0.716 (CI 95% 0.657-0.776, p<0.001), respectively. The optimal values of cut-off point were 74.98 ng/ml (sensitivity 70%, specificity 71%) for YKL-40 and 3.21 mg/l (sensitivity 66%, specificity 68%) for hsCRP to predict lesion progression.Increased serum YKL-40 and hsCRP levels are independently associated with lesion progression in patients with CAD.",

        "abstract": "Results Genotype distribution and allele frequency of \u22121612 5A/6A MMP-3 and 3\u2032UTR C/T TIMP-4 differed between patients with PP and those without in both diabetic and non-diabetic groups after Bonferroni's correction (all P < 0.0041667, except for allele frequency of MMP-3 [ P = 0.007] and genotype/allele frequency of TIMP-4 [ P = 0.04 and P = 0.016, respectively] in diabetes). MMP-3 and TIMP-4 polymorphisms were associated with changes in percent diameter stenosis and minimal lumen diameter in diabetic patients, and changes in cumulative coronary obstruction in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients (all P < 0.05). Multivariable regression analysis revealed that hypertension, low HDL-C and genotypes of MMP-3 and TIMP-4 were independent determinants of PP in the whole patients, with these 2 genetic factors being associated with PP in diabetic and non-diabetic subgroups. Conclusion This study demonstrated that MMP-3 and TIMP-4 polymorphisms affect angiographic coronary PP in type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Keywords Matrix metallopeptidase Tissue inhibitor of matrix metallopeptidase Polymorphism Plaque progression Diabetes mellitus 1 Introduction Atherosclerosis is characterized by a complex multi-factorial pathophysiology, in which genetic factor plays a role. Many studies have looked at the association between polymorphic variants in candidate genes and atherosclerosis. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family consists of > 20 proteases, functioning to degrade collagens and other extracellular matrix proteins to maintain vascular homeostasis. Abnormal activities and expression of MMPs and TIMPs (tissue inhibitors of MMPs) have been implicated in the vascular remodeling and atherosclerosis [1] . Accumulating evidence suggests that several genetic variations of MMPs and TIMPs are predisposed to the development of atherosclerotic pathology, among which MMP-3 was associated with plaque progression (PP) [2\u20138] . Patients with diabetes display a substantially increased incidence of adverse cardiac events [9,10] . Intensified inflammatory reaction and impaired vascular homeostasis in diabetes have a direct influence on the formation and progression of atherosclerosis [11] . Moreover, previous studies have demonstrated significantly dysregulated expression and activities of major MMPs and TIMPs in vessel wall as well as in serum levels in diabetes, as compared to those in non-diabetes [12\u201317] . Thus, it is rational to evaluate the contribution of genetic variants in MMP-TIMP system to atherosclerosis progression separately, in diabetic or non-diabetic pathophysiological status. Until now, there has been a paucity of data regarding the relation between genetic variations of MMP-TIMP and atherosclerotic PP, especially in diabetic patients. As a preliminary study leading to a much larger evaluation of all intra-genic variation, in this study we assessed the relationship between 12 functional polymorphisms in MMP-1, -2, -3, -9, -10, -12, -13 and TIMP-1, -2, -3, -4 and angiographic PP at 1-year follow-up among non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic patients [2,18\u201325] , and compared baseline serum levels of MMP-1, -2, -3, -9, -10, -12, -13 and TIMP-1, -2, -3, -4 in patients with PP versus those without PP. 2 Methods 2.1 Patients Study participants were recruited from Shanghai Rui Jin Hospital Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) Outcome Program [26] , which aimed to estimate risk-adjusted outcomes in patients receiving PCI treatment. Data regarding demographics, clinical and angiographic features, and in-hospital management were collected retrospectively, whereas clinical and angiographic outcomes during follow-up were identified prospectively. A total of 976 consecutive patients with coronary artery disease underwent drug-eluting stent based PCI between October 2004 and December 2006. Excluded from the study were patients with acute myocardial infarction ( n = 72), severe heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction < 30% ( n = 34), renal failure requiring dialysis ( n = 6), type 1 diabetes and serious life-threatening inflammation ( n = 28). For the purpose of this study, patients who died ( n = 21) or had no knowledge of repeat angiography during follow-up ( n = 255), and loss to follow-up ( n = 35) were also excluded from analysis. Another 26 patients were not included in this study because of symptom-driven repeat intervention and acute myocardial infarction undergoing primary PCI within 6\u00a0months of initial examination. The remaining 499 patients formed the study population, who had at least 1 stenotic lesion (luminal diameter narrowing > 20%) located at non-PCI intervened vessels on baseline coronary angiograms and received follow-up angiography at one year. The protocol was approved by the hospital Ethics Committee and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. 2.2 Coronary angiography and quantitative analysis Coronary arteriography and interventional procedures were performed by standard Judkins techniques or through radial approach [26] . Intracoronary injection of nitroglycerin (100\u00a0\u03bcg) was routinely made to avoid artery spasm. Coronary angiograms recorded at identical projections during initial and follow-up studies were used for quantitative coronary analyses (QCA, Centricity Cardiology CA 1000. v1.0, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). All imaging analyses were performed by 2 experienced interventional cardiologists, who were blind to patients' clinical data. Severity of coronary atherosclerosis was defined according to the numbers of coronary vessels with significant stenosis (angiographic luminal stenosis > 50%) as 1-, 2-, or 3-vessel disease. For lesion analysis, end-diastolic frames from both baseline and follow-up angiograms were selected with identical angulations that best showed the stenosis at its most severe degree with minimal foreshortening and branch overlap. Matching arterial segments were defined from the images acquired on the basis of the anatomic location of proximal and distal side branches. The coronary artery segments analyzed included all those plaques with a reference diameter \u2265 1.5\u00a0mm and a stenosis \u2265 20% at baseline and those with new lesions at follow-up in non-PCI artery. All coronary arteries intervened with PCI were excluded to avoid inclusion of post-PCI neointimal hyperplasia or restenosis. Using the outer diameter of the contrast-filled catheter as the calibration, the minimal lumen diameter (MLD) in diastole was measured from multiple projection; the results from the single \u201cworst\u201d view were recorded. The reference segment diameter was averaged from user-defined, 5-mm-long, angiographically normal segments proximal and distal to the lesion but between any major side branches. Atherosclerotic PP was defined as \u2265 1 lesion with decreased MLD \u2265 0.4\u00a0mm from baseline to follow-up angiography, a change representing approximately twice the SD for repeat measurements for lesions [27] , and occurrence of a new coronary lesion defined as a stenosis that was not apparent on the initial angiogram or was < 20% in diameter stenosis but that narrowed by \u2265 0.4\u00a0mm in MLD at the follow-up angiogram [28] . Cumulative coronary obstruction was the sum of all percent diameter stenoses in standard index unit (SI 50% = 0.50) [29,30] . Change of QCA measurement was defined as baseline QCA measurement minus follow-up measurement. All participants were grouped according to the presence or absence of coronary PP and of type 2 diabetes (fasting plasma glucose concentration \u2265 7.0\u00a0mmol/l and/or 2-h postprandial glucose level \u2265 11.1\u00a0mmol/l, taking anti-diabetic medications or receiving parenteral insulin treatment). 2.3 Biochemical assessment Blood samples were collected after overnight fasting and stored at \u2212 80\u00a0\u00b0C. White blood cell count and serum levels of glucose and lipid profiles (total cholesterol [TC], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], lipoprotein [Lp] (a) and triglycerides [TG] ) were measured (Hitachi 912 Analyzer, Roche Diagnostics, Germany). Serum levels of MMP-1, -2, -3, -9, -10, -12, -13 and TIMP-1, -2, -3, -4 were determined using commercially available ELISA kits (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The linear range was 0.08\u2013125\u00a0ng/ml for MMP-1, -3, -13, 8\u201310,000\u00a0ng/ml for TIMP-4, 39\u20132500\u00a0pg/ml for MMP-10, -12, and 8\u20131000\u00a0ng/ml for other measurements. All ELISA measurements were taken in duplicate, and the intra-sample variation was < 10%, inter-assay CV was < 15%. 2.4 Polymerase chain reaction and genotyping Genome DNA was prepared with a DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and stored at \u2212 80\u00a0\u00b0C before use. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was performed using genomic DNA as a template in a final reaction volume of 50\u00a0\u03bcl. Genotyping was determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) or by sequencing. Primer Express Software (ABI, Foster City, CA) was used to design primers ( Table 1 ). Briefly, in a final volume of 50\u00a0\u03bcl, PCR buffer, 10\u00a0pmol of forward and reverse primers, 2.5\u00a0units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison WI), and 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg of template DNA were mixed. PCR condition was: denaturation at 94\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min, followed by 35\u00a0cycles of denaturation at 94\u00a0\u00b0C for 60\u00a0s, annealing for 60\u00a0s, extension at 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 60\u00a0s, and final extension at 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. The restriction enzyme digestion maps were visualized on 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide. For PCR products which needed sequencing, the reaction mixture was purified using a commercially available PCR product purification kit (Promega), and sequencing was performed with ABI Prism 3700 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to determine the polymorphisms. 2.5 Statistical analyses Continuous variables were expressed as mean \u00b1 SD, and categorical variables were presented as frequencies. Normal distribution was evaluated with Kolmolgorov\u2013Smirnov test. Logarithmic transformation was performed on the continuous variables of non-normal distribution before statistical calculations. Comparisons between groups were made using unpaired t tests or ANOVA, when appropriate. Comparisons between baseline and follow-up were performed with paired t tests, and qualitative variables were compared using \u03c7 2 test. Since 12 polymorphisms were evaluated to compare SNP frequencies between patients with PP and those without, Bonferroni's correction of P value was performed. Multivariate logistic regression model was constructed to assess the independent determinants of PP. A 2-sided probability level of \u2264 0.05 was considered significant. All analyses were done with SPSS for Windows 13.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). 3 Results 3.1 Clinical characteristics and angiographic features Among a total of 499 patients (364 non-diabetic and 135 diabetic patients) in this study, PP occurred in 186 (51.1%) non-diabetic and 63 (46.7%) diabetic patients. Diabetic patients with PP did not differ significantly from those without PP regarding age, gender, cigarette smoking, kidney function test results and medical treatments, but hypertension and higher triglyceride were more prevalent in these patients with PP than in those without. Serum levels of HDL-C were lower in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients with PP ( Table 2 ). As expectation, diabetic patients displayed higher incidence of multi-vessel diseases. Dramatic changes in percent diameter stenosis, MLD and cumulative coronary obstruction were observed in the examined coronary arteries in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients with PP (all P < 0.001) ( Table 2 ). No obvious difference was observed in clinical characteristics between 255 patients without repeat angiography and initially excluded from analysis and those participating to this study (data not shown). 3.2 Genotype distribution and allele frequencies of MMPs and TIMPs The distributions of MMP and TIMP polymorphisms were consistent with Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium except for 180A/G MMP-10 (4 subjects with AG genotype, the others having GG genotype) and -82A/G MMP-12 (8 subjects with AG genotype, the others having AA genotype). Notably, significant difference in genotype distribution and allele frequency of -1612 5A/6A in MMP-3 were observed between patients with PP and those without in both diabetic and non-diabetic groups, with allele 6A being related to lesion progression after Bonferroni's correction of P value (all P < 0.004, except P = 0.007 for allele frequency difference). Patients carrying allele T at 3\u2032UTR of TIMP-4 displayed marked PP in non-diabetic group ( P < 0.0041667) and obvious trend in diabetic group ( P = 0.016). -790\u00a0T/G MMP-2 demonstrated mild disparity in genotype distribution and high allele T frequency in patients with PP versus those with no PP in diabetic cohort ( P = 0.041 and P = 0.022). The other polymorphisms of MMPs and TIMPs examined did not show any association with PP in diabetic or non-diabetic patients ( Table 3 ). Serum levels of MMP-1, -2, -3, -9, -10, -12, -13 and TIMP-1, -2, -3, -4 did not differ between patient with PP and those without in both diabetic and non-diabetic groups (see supplemental Table ), neither did these levels correlate with genotypes of MMPs and TIMPs. 3.3 Relation between MMP and TIMP genotypes and change in QCA measurements Prominent difference in changes of MLD and cumulative coronary obstruction was observed among genotypes of MMP-2, -3 and TIMP-4 polymorphisms ( Table 4 ). Genotype 6A6A of -1612 5A/6A MMP-3 was associated with changes in percent diameter stenosis ( P = 0.028) and MLD ( P < 0.01) in diabetic group, and correlated with increased cumulative coronary obstruction in both diabetic and non-diabetic groups (all P < 0.01). Patients with genotype TT of -790G/T MMP-2 had apparent changes in these QCA measurements in diabetic group (all P < 0.05). In addition, genotype carrying allele T of TIMP-4 (3\u2032UTR C/T) were related to cumulative coronary obstruction in non-diabetic and diabetic groups (both P < 0.01), and correlated with changes in percent diameter stenosis and MLD in diabetic group (both P < 0.01). However, the other examined polymorphisms of MMP-TIMP did not correlate with the QCA measurements. 3.4 Multivariable regression analysis Multivariable logistic regression analysis, including traditional cardiovascular risk factors and genetic variants ( Tables 2 and 3 ), revealed that hypertension, low HDL-C, genotype 6A/6A of MMP-3 polymorphism, and genotypes carrying allele T of TIMP-4 polymorphism were independently associated with PP in the whole patients. These two genetic factors persisted to be independent risk factors for PP in diabetic and non-diabetic groups, together with other risk factors ( Table 5 ). In addition, cumulative effects of MMP-3 (6A/6A) and TIMP-4 genotypes (CT and TT) were also observed in the whole ( P < 0.001) and diabetic patients ( P = 0.002), with obvious trend in non-diabetic patients ( P = 0.062) ( Table 6 ). 4 Discussion Accumulating data have indicated that MMP polymorphisms exert influence on the development of atherosclerosis [2\u20134] . MMP-TIMP system in vessel wall is substantially dysregulated in diabetes, jointly representing a critical but potentially unequal impact of genetic variations of MMP-TIMPs on coronary lesion progression in diabetes and non-diabetes [31] . This study demonstrated an association of MMP-3-1612 5A/6A with PP in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, and for the first time, showed that genotypes carrying allele T of 3\u2032UTR TIMP4 were related to PP in these patients. These two polymorphisms were associated with changes in percent diameter stenosis, MLD and cumulative coronary obstruction. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that genotype 6A/6A MMP-3 and allele T carriers of TIMP-4 were independent determinants of PP after adjusting conventional risk factors, with prominent cumulative effect of these two genetic factors. Taken together, our results supported a hypothesis that genetic variations in MMP-TIMP family may affect coronary atherosclerotic PP in diabetes as well as in non-diabetes. MMP-3 has a proteolytic activity on a number of extracellular matrix proteins, ranging from collagen, proteoglycans, laminin, and elastin to gelatins. It can also activate several other MMPs. The 5A/6A polymorphism of MMP-3 is located within the interleukin-1 responsive element for several transcriptional regulators including NF-kB p50 homodimer [32] . In vitro experiments showed that 5A allele had increased activity in driving gene expression than 6A allele [32\u201334] . Patients with genotypes carrying allele 6A had a high rate of coronary artery disease and angiographic coronary atherosclerotic lesion growth [2\u20134] . Our findings were consistent with those results, and the associative effect was further extended from the field of non-diabetes to diabetes. In this study, the genotype and allele frequencies of 5A/6A polymorphism were comparable to those in a study exploring the same polymorphism in Chinese patients with myocardial infarction [35] . In addition, the frequencies of allele 6A in patients with PP (91.3% in diabetes and 89.2% in non-diabetes) were similar to those in patients with unstable angina (84%) reported by White et al. Likewise, patients without PP (78.5% in diabetes and 80.1% in non-diabetes) and those with stable angina (68%) in their study had close frequency of allele 6A [4] . TIMP-4 is expressed predominantly in the heart, which binds strongly to the carboxyl hemopexin domain of MMP-2 and inhibits the activation of MMP-2. Since 3\u2032 UTR is involved in regulating gene expression at pre-mRNA level, genetic variations in cis -elements of 3\u2032UTR may affect 3\u2032UTR formation, polyadenylation, mRNA stability and regulation of gene expression. C/T 3\u2032UTR TIMP-4 polymorphisms produce alterations in mRNA stem-loop structure, which is critical for regulation of mRNA stability and translation [36] . Our study is the first to show that this polymorphism was related to PP in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. Moreover, the allele T frequency in patients with PP (20.5%) was similar to that in patients with arthritis (25.2%), as compared to those in controls (11.6% and 13.7%, respectively), in a study investigating the relation of TIMP-4 polymorphism and arthritis occurrence [36] . Nevertheless, this associative effect in our study was weak in diabetes, which may be explained, at least partly, by the small number of diabetic patients. Difference in genotype and allele frequency of MMP-2-790T/G polymorphism was also a novel finding in diabetic patients with PP versus those without. However, multivariable analysis did not support the association after adjusting conventional risk factors. Previous studies noted that this polymorphism was associated with coronary triple vessel disease [37] . Bioinformatic analysis suggested that allele T sequence allowed a direct binding of three transcription factors, but not G variant of MMP-2-790\u00a0T/G polymorphism. The reason for the absence of associative effect in non-diabetic patients remains unknown as there was no direct evidence explaining the molecular function of this polymorphism. In this study, serum concentrations of MMP-1, -2, -3, -9, -10, -12, -13 and TIMP-1, -2, -3, -4 did not differ significantly between patients with PP and those without in both diabetic and non-diabetic groups. This may be mainly due to predominant usage of anti-atherosclerotic agents including statins. However, the possibility that genetic polymorphisms may affect tissue levels could not be excluded simply by measuring plasma MMP levels alone. Finally, we combined the diabetic and non-diabetic patients, and grouped them based upon coronary PP. Logistic regression analysis showed that diabetes was not an independent determinant of PP. This could be partially caused by the composition of recruited patients in our study. 5 Limitation There were several limitations for our study. First, the sample size of diabetic group was relatively small, but the associative effect could be statistically identified with the current number of subjects. Nevertheless, a large-scale prospective study should be launched to confirm the associative effect of these polymorphisms with PP. Second, we analyzed only one polymorphism in most of the genes, which could have missed an association that was to a specific polymorphism. However, this study benefited from a prospective recruitment and from a candidate gene approach. We selected 11 genes of MMP-TIMP family on the basis of their relevance in the pathophysiology of coronary atherosclerotic progression, and major polymorphisms selected for this study were functional and were implicated in disease occurrence. 6 Conclusion The present study has demonstrated that polymorphisms of MMP-3 and TIMP-4 affect angiographic coronary PP in non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic patients. Determination of frequent population polymorphisms in MMP-TIMP genes and evaluation of genotype risks for multigenic coronary atherosclerotic progression may be fundamental for individual therapy.

        "abstract": "It is thought that carbamylated modification plays a crucial role in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, information on the biological effects of carbamylated high-density lipoprotein (C-HDL) in ESRD is poor. This study investigated the carbamylation level of HDL in ESRD and the effects of C-HDL on endothelial repair properties. HDL was isolated from healthy controls (n = 22) and patients with ESRD (n = 30). The carbamylation level of HDL was detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Isolated carbamylated HDL for use in tissue culture experiments was carbamylated in vitro to a similar extent to that observed in ESRD. Human arterial endothelial cells (HAECs) were treated with C-HDL or native HDL to assess their migration, proliferation and angiogenesis properties. HDL-associated paraoxonase1 (PON1) activity was also determined by spectrophotometry assay. Compared with healthy controls, the carbamylation level of HDL in ESRD patients was increased and positively correlated with blood urea concentration. In vitro, C-HDL significantly inhibited migration, angiogenesis and proliferation in endothelial cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that HDL-associated PON1 activity was decreased and negatively correlated with carbamylation level of HDL in ESRD patients. In addition, C-HDL suppressed the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) signaling pathways in endothelial cells. In conclusion, this study identified a significantly increased carbamylation level of HDL in ESRD. Furthermore, C-HDL inhibited endothelial cell repair function.",

Patients were divided into four groups based on the presence/absence of T2DM and of significant CAD (diameter stenosis >or=70%).Serum levels of GA, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 were significantly higher and, in contrast, serum esRAGE levels were lower in patients with both T2DM and significant CAD than in all other groups (all P<0.01), whereas there were no significant differences in GA and esRAGE levels between non-diabetic patients with CAD and those without. Serum GA and esRAGE levels correlated with angiographic CAD severity (P=0.031 and P=0.001), extent (both P<0.001) and number of diseased coronary arteries (both P<0.001) in diabetic CAD patients. At multivariable regression analysis, male gender, age, hypertension, cigarette smoking, HDL-C, lipoprotein (a), GA, esRAGE, hsCRP and TNF-alpha were all independent determinants of significant CAD in diabetic patients. Moreover, male gender, age, hypertension, lipoprotein (a), GA and esRAGE remained independently associated with three-vessel disease.Patients with T2DM and CAD feature elevated serum GA and decreased serum esRAGE levels. Here serum GA and esRAGE levels are associated with angiographic extent and severity of CAD.",

        "abstract": "High-density lipoprotein (HDL) confers protection against cardiovascular disease partly attributable to its robust anti-oxidant activities, which is largely impaired in diabetic conditions. In this study, we analyzed the anti-oxidant activity of HDL, as represented by the arylesterase activity of paraoxonase 1 (PON1) in HDL particles, in 216 consecutive HF patients with (n\u2009=\u200979) or without (n\u2009=\u2009137) type 2 diabetes, and age- and gender-matched 112 diabetic and 189 non-diabetic non-HF controls. We found arylesterase activity was significantly decreased in patients with than without HF, and was further decreased when comorbid with diabetes. After adjusting for conventional risk factors and apolipoprotein A-I levels, arylesterase activity remained correlated positively with left ventricular ejection fraction in diabetic (r\u2009=\u20090.325, P\u2009=\u20090.020) but not non-diabetic patients (r\u2009=\u20090.089, P\u2009=\u20090.415), and negatively with NT-proBNP and NYHA functional class in both subgroups. In regression analyses, a higher risk of HF was observed in diabetic than non-diabetic patients when having low arylesterase activities. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that impaired serum arylesterase activity in patients with HF is further reduced when comorbid with diabetes. The relationship of impaired arylesterase activity to HF is especially enhanced in diabetic patients.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to characterize matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) in relation to changes in left ventricle (LV) geometry and function in a porcine model with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. In 15 Chinese Guizhou minipigs with STZ-induced diabetes (diabetic group) and 15 age-matched normal controls (control group), Doppler tissue imaging was performed at 6 months of diabetes. Serum MMP-2, -9, TIMP-1, -4 and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) were determined. Expression of MMPs, TIMPs, urokinase type-plasminogen activator (uPA), its receptor (uPAR) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in aortic intima and LV myocardium was evaluated, with gelatinolytic activities of tissue MMP-2, -9 accessed by zymography. Left ventricle end-diastolic septum thickness (P < 0.05) and mass (P < 0.05) were increased, whereas peak systolic mitral annulus velocity (Sm, P < 0.001), LV systolic (P = 0.01) and diastolic strain (P < 0.001) were significantly decreased in diabetic group than in controls. Diabetic group showed higher expression of TIMP-1, -4 in aortic intima and LV myocardium (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), with increased collagen content and elevated serum BNP level (P = 0.004) and lower gelatinolytic activities of tissue MMP-2, -9 (all P < 0.05). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR of those diabetic tissues revealed elevated mRNA levels of major TIMPs, uPA, uPAR and PAI-1. Reduction of serum MMP-2 and -9 levels was observed in diabetic group vs. control group (both P < 0.05). This study features elevated levels of TIMP-1, -4, uPA, uPAR and PAI-1, and decreased activities of MMP-2, -9 in aorta and myocardium in STZ-induced diabetic minipigs, indicating that MMP-TIMP dysregulation is associated with LV hypertrophy, cardiac dysfunction and increased cardiovascular fibrosis in diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been implicated in human heart failure, but the mechanism remains elusive. We hypothesized that ACE2 deficiency would exacerbate angiotensin (Ang) II-mediated myocardial injury.10-week-old ACE2 knockout (ACE2KO) and wild-type mice received by mini-osmotic pump either AngII (1.5 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1)) or saline for 2 weeks. ACE2 deficiency triggered greater increases in the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), fractalkine (FKN) and phosphorylated ERK1/2 in AngII-treated ACE2KO hearts. These changes were associated with greater activation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2, MMP9 and MT1-MMP and exacerbation of myocardial injury and dysfunction. In cultured cardiofibroblasts, exposure to AngII (100 nmol/L) for 30 min resulted in marked increases in superoxide production and expression of CTGF, FKN and phosphorylated ERK1/2, which were strikingly prevented by recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2; 1mg/ml) and the CTGF-neutralizing antibody (5 \u03bcg/ml), but were aggravated by ACE2 inhibitor DX600 (0.5 \u03bcmol/L). These protective effects of rhACE2 were eradicated by the Ang-(1-7) antagonist A779 (1 \u03bcmol/L). More intriguingly, rhACE2 treatment significantly abolished AngII-mediated increases in MMP2, MMP9 and MT1-MMP in cardiofibroblasts.Loss of ACE2 exacerbates AngII-mediated inflammation, myocardial injury and dysfunction in ACE2-deficient hearts via activation of the CTGF-FKN-ERK and MMP signaling. ACE2 gene may represent a potential candidate to prevent and treat myocardial injury and heart diseases.",

        "abstract": "This study investigated whether S100A4 plays a potential role in the formation of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA).The thoracic aortas of male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 0.5 M CaCl2 or normal saline (NaCl). Animals were euthanized at specified time-points (2, 4, and 10 weeks post-TAA induction). The treated aortic segments were harvested, and mRNA levels, protein expressions and immunohistochemistry of MMP-2, MMP-9 and S100A4 were analyzed. The A7r5 cell lines were used for an in vitro study. Experiments were also performed using human TAA samples for comparison. Localized aneurysmal dilation was observed in the CaCl2-treated segments. The transcription levels of S100A4 and MMPs were elevated in CaCl2-treated segments versus controls, and a significant correlation between S100A4 and expression of MMPs was observed across all time-points. Immunohistochemical studies revealed similar expression pattern of S100A4 and MMP proteins, as well as co-localization of S100A4 with the cell lineage markers (\u03b1SMA and CD68) and inflammatory markers (MMPs and NF-\u03baB P65 subunit). The proliferative ability of A7r5 cells after transfection with S100A4 siRNA was suppressed, and down-regulation of S100A4 inhibited MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in vitro. Increased expression of S100A4 was observed in all layers of the aorta wall in human TAA specimens. Serum concentrations of S100A4 determined by ELISA were found to be significantly increased in TAA patients.This study established the important roles of S100A4 and MMPs in the development of TAA.",

This study aimed to determine the molecular link between AGE-induced\n fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) expression and macrophage lipid accumulation. AGE\u2013BSA markedly increased macrophage FABP4\n expression via engagement of RAGE, a 35-kDa transmembrane receptor that is able to bind extracellular AGE and responsible\n for the corresponding signal transduction, whereas knockdown of RAGE significantly reversed the FABP4 up-regulation.

Finally, administration\n of FABP4 inhibitor totally abolished the increased lipid contents in response to AGE\u2013BSA. These results indicate that FABP4\n up-regulation is responsible for the enhanced macrophage lipid accumulation by AGE, which may underlie the accelerated formation\n of foam cells and development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases in diabetic patients.",

        "abstract": "A comprehensive evaluation of the benefits of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists on cardiac remodeling is lacking. We aimed to evaluate the impact of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists on changes in cardiac structure and function of left ventricular dysfunction.Articles were identified by online searches in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases before June 2012, by hand searches of reviews and relevant journals, and by contact with the authors. Qualified articles were restricted to randomized controlled trials. There were, respectively, 12, 4, and 3 qualified trials that randomized 572, 647, and 407 patients to spironolactone, canrenoate, and eplerenone, and 531, 655, and 395 patients to placebo or active treatment, respectively. Overall, under mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist treatment there was improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (weighted mean difference, 2.97; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.26-3.67; P<0.0005), left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volume index (weighted mean difference, -5.64; 95% CI, -7.94 to -3.34; P<0.0005 and weighted mean difference, -7.46; 95% CI, -11.63 to -3.3; P<0.0005), serum amino-terminal peptide of procollagen type-III (weighted mean difference, -1.12; 95% CI, -1.49 to -0.74; P<0.0005), B-type natriuretic peptide (weighted mean difference, -67.06; 95% CI, -91.24 to -42.88; P<0.0005), peak velocities of early mitral inflow (E; weighted mean difference, -9.57; 95% CI, -12.98 to -6.17; P<0.0005), and E wave deceleration time (weighted mean difference, 7.08; 95% CI, 4.07-10.09; P<0.0005). There was low probability of heterogeneity and publication bias.Our findings demonstrate that mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist treatment may exert beneficial effects on the reversal of cardiac remodeling and improvement of left ventricular function.",

        "abstract": "Design and methods: Serum levels of glycated albumin, hsCRP, TNF-\u03b1 and blood glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were measured in 317 consecutive patients with T2DM and 309 normal controls. Patients with T2DM were grouped based upon coronary angiographic findings (Group I: 151 patients with normal coronary arteries; Group II: 166 patients with significant coronary stenosis [> 70% luminal diameter narrowing]) and renal functional status evaluated by estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) (normal renal function group: 187 patients with CrCl > 90\u00a0mL/min; mild renal insufficiency group: 103 patients with CrCl 60\u201390\u00a0mL/min; moderate renal insufficiency group: 27 patients with CrCl 30\u201360\u00a0mL/min). Multivariate analysis was performed to determine independent risk factors for CAD and renal insufficiency in patients with T2DM. Results: Serum levels of glycated albumin, hsCRP and TNF-\u03b1 were significantly higher in Group II than in controls ( P < 0.01) and Group I ( P < 0.01). A significant difference was found in glycated albumin, hsCRP and TNF-\u03b1 levels among diabetic patients with mild, moderate renal insufficiency and normal renal function ( P < 0.05). These biochemical measurements correlated significantly with number of diseased coronary vessels ( P < 0.01) and status of renal function ( P < 0.05). No difference existed in HbA1c levels between Group II and Group I, and among patients with various CrCL stages. Multivariate analysis revealed that male gender, old age and serum levels of glycated albumin, hsCRP, TNF-\u03b1 and lipoprotein (a) were independent risk factors for CAD, and older age, hypertension and glycated albumin were for CrCl < 60\u00a0mL/min in diabetes. Conclusions: Increased serum levels of glycated albumin, hsCRP and TNF-\u03b1 are associated with the presence and severity of CAD and renal impairment in patients with T2DM. Keywords Glycated albumin HbA1c C-reactive protein Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 Type 2 diabetes mellitus Introduction Diabetes mellitus is a potentially devastating disease with a high morbidity and mortality. It is associated with accelerated atherosclerotic process affecting arteries that supply major organs in the body. As a result, patients with diabetes are at high risk for cardiovascular diseases, stroke and renal dysfunction. Glucose forms Shiff bases with reactive amino groups of circulating or vessel wall proteins in hyperglycemic milieu to create Amadori-type early glycation products in hours and weeks. Some of the Amadori products continue to undergo complex series of chemical rearrangement for months, which results in the consequent formation of irreversible advanced glycation end products (AGEs). A large body of evidence demonstrated that AGEs have been implicated in micro- and macro-vascular complications of diabetes [1\u20133] . Glycated albumin is a kind of Amadori-modified derivatives, accounting for about 80% of the circulating glycated proteins in vivo. Hyperglycemia increases serum glycated albumin level, and the extent of increase reflects glycemia status of diabetic patients over a retrospective period. Previous study showed that glycated albumin was more sensitive than glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the evaluation of the severity of diabetes [4] . Glycated albumin has been shown to be related to diabetic progression and development of vascular complications [5\u20137] . It induces expression of interleukin-8 and E-selectin on endothelial cells and increases expression of monocyte chemoattractant peptide and IL-6 in vascular smooth muscle cells via activation of protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase and nuclear factor-\u03baB pathways. Glycated albumin stimulates reactive oxygen species production through protein kinase C-dependent activation in cardiac myocytes [8\u201312] . Cumulative evidence has demonstrated that AGE-albumin, a further glycation-modified protein exerts much stronger pathogenic influence in vivo. Injection of AGE-albumin to normal rats stimulated CD40L expression on circulating platelets and up-regulated CD40 mRNA levels in cultured endothelial cells [13] , suggesting that the AGE-albumin could enhance CD40\u2013CD40L interaction, thereby promoting atherogenesis. In contrast, neutralization of bio-effects of AGEs by administrating soluble receptor for AGEs suppressed early acceleration of atherosclerosis as well as prevented disease progression in diabetic mice [14,15] . These experimental results indicate that atherosclerotic process may be initiated and promoted partly by glycated albumin and AGEs formed in hyperglycemia, with the involvement of inflammatory mechanism. Data from experiments with glomerular mesangial and endothelial cells in culture have established that glycated albumin induced significant alterations in glomerular cell biology, which is related to diabetic nephropathy. Introduction into normal rats of serum glycated proteins in concentrations found in streptozotocin-mediated diabetic rats induced hyperfiltration and development of glomerular basement membrane thickening [16,17] . The adverse effects of glycated albumin on kidney are further supported by the findings that glycated albumin concentration was independently associated with diabetic nephropathy and vascular dysfunction [18] and that localization of glycated albumin in glomeruli of patients with diabetic nephropathy corresponded with the severity of renal involvement [19] . Taken together, these results have suggested that glycated albumin and AGEs including AGE-albumin have a critical role in pathogenesis of kidney diseases in diabetes. Therefore, determination of serum glycated albumin level reflects the risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) and renal damage caused by Amadori-modified proteins and, to some extent, AGEs load in vivo, besides revealing status of glycemic control [20] . To our knowledge, information regarding glycated albumin levels in patients with diabetes and diabetic complications remains scarce. The present study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between serum levels of glycated albumin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and TNF-\u03b1, blood HbA1c concentration and the severity of CAD and renal insufficiency in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods Study population The study population included 317 consecutive patients with T2DM (178 men and 139 women, aged 52\u201373 years) who underwent coronary angiography between July 2004 and May 2006. Diabetes was defined as a fasting serum glucose level > 7.0\u00a0mmol/L or a 2-hour postprandial glucose > 11.1\u00a0mmol/L, or taking oral hypoglycemic drugs or parental insulin medication. All patients were divided into 2 groups based upon angiographic findings. Group I comprised 151 patients with normal coronary arteries, and Group II consisted of 166 patients with significant coronary stenosis. Coronary arteriography was performed using standard Judkins techniques or through radial approach. Significant CAD was defined as the presence of luminal diameter stenosis \u2265 70% in the left anterior descending artery or its first diagonal branch, left circumflex artery or its first obtuse marginal branch, and right coronary artery. Left main stenosis (\u2265 50% luminal narrowing) was considered as 2-vessel disease. In accordance with lesion severity previously correlated with reduced coronary flow reserve and with clinical standards recognized in the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for coronary angiography, patients with severe disease had at least 1 coronary stenosis of \u2265 70%. Multi-vessel disease referred to stenotic lesions with \u2265 2 vessel involvement. Clinical characteristics and risk factors for CAD were recorded for each patient. Almost all diabetic patients in Group I and Group II were receiving anti-diabetic treatment and majority of them were taking statins. Patients with acute coronary syndrome, previous myocardial infarction and heart failure were excluded. None had type 1 diabetes mellitus, chronic viral or bacterial infection, tumor or immune system disorders. Three hundred and nine normal subjects (168 men and 141 women, aged 56\u201372 years) were served as a control group. Their professional activities and diet styles were matched with the above 2 study groups. None was receiving medication or dietary supplements, and all had no history of diabetes and CAD. Liver and renal functional tests were normal. The protocol was approved by the hospital Ethics Committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Biochemical assessments Fasting overnight blood sample was collected for each patient. Serum glucose, liver function, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] and triglycerides were measured (HITACHI 912 Analyser, Roche Diagnostics, Germany). HbA1c was assayed using ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography with Bio-rad Variant Hemoglobin Testing System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). HsCRP was determined using a high-sensitivity ELISA kit (Biocheck Laboratories, USA) with the linear range of 0.62\u2013119.3\u00a0mg/L and interassay coefficient of variation (CV) < 7.5%. Serum TNF-\u03b1 level was assessed using Human TNF-\u03b1/TNFSF1A Quantikine ELISA kit (R&D systems, USA) with an interassay CV of < 7.4%. Serum glycated albumin level was determined with improved bromocresolpurple method using Lucica TM glycated albumin-L assay kit (Asahi Kasei Pharma, Japan). Briefly, endogenous glycated amino acids were first eliminated by oxidation with ketoamine oxidase, and then glycated albumin was hydrolyzed and oxidized to produce hydrogen peroxide, which was quantitatively measured. Glycated albumin value was subsequently normalized with serum albumin level. Significant correlation was found between glycated albumin value detected by this method and by high-performance liquid chromatography ( r = 0.995) [21] . The linear range of the kit was 3.2\u201368.1% and a maximum interassay CV was 3.0%. Evaluation of renal function Renal function was evaluated by the estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) derived from Cockroft\u2013Gault formula [22] , where CrCl (mL/min) = ([140 \u2212 age] \u00d7 weight [kg]) / 72 serum creatinine [mg/dL] \u00d7 0.85 for women. This equation has a close correlation with measured CrCl (correlation coefficient 0.83) and provides more accurate assessment of renal function than serum creatinine alone [23] . Renal function was normal if CrCl was > 90\u00a0mL/min, whereas mild or moderated renal insufficiency was diagnosed when CrCl was 60\u201390\u00a0mL/min or < 60 Lm/min, respectively. Diabetic patients in the present study were also stratified by CrCl value as normal renal function group (187 patients), mild renal insufficiency group (103 patients) and moderate renal insufficiency group (27 patients). Statistical analysis Data are expressed as mean (SD) or mean (95% CI). Concentrations of hsCRP and TNF-\u03b1 were logarithmically transformed, and comparisons between groups were made using ANOVA. Because glycated albumin, triglycerides, Lp(a) and creatinine values were not normally distributed, between-group differences were assessed by the Mann\u2013Whitney U test. Pearson\u2019s and Spearman\u2019s correlations were used to test the relationship between variables. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to determine the independent risk factors for CAD and renal insufficiency in patients with T2DM, expressed as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. All statistical analyses were done using SPSS 13.0 software, and a value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Clinical characteristics Baseline demographic, clinical characteristics and angiographic features are shown in Table 1 . Comparing to control group, patients in Group II were more cigarette smokers, had increased serum glucose level, higher systolic blood pressure, and elevated serum Lp(a), triglyceride and blood urea nitrogen levels (all P < 0.05). Serum creatinine level was significantly higher and CrCl was lower in Group II ( P < 0.001). Most of the diabetic patients with and without CAD were receiving statin medication (Group I, 65.6%; Group II, 75.3%, P > 0.05, Table 1 ). The percentage of patients receiving peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) agonists or insulin was slightly high in Group II than in Group I, but did not reach statistical significance level (20.4% versus 15.2% and 40.4% versus 29.8%, respectively, both P > 0.05) ( Table 1 ). There was also no difference in other anti-diabetic agents between diabetic patients with and without CAD, and among those with various numbers of diseased coronary arteries (data not shown). Serum glycated albumin and HbA1c levels As expected, serum glycated albumin level was significantly higher in Group I (19.4%, 95% CI 18.8 to 20.3%) than in controls (14.8%, 95% CI 14.7 to 15.1%, P < 0.01) ( Table 2 ), and it was further elevated in Group II (21.1%, 95% CI 20.4 to 21.7%, P < 0.05 versus Group I). Significant difference in glycated albumin level was found between patients with 3-vessel disease and those with 1-vessel disease (21.9%, 95% CI 21.1 to 22.8% versus 19.9%, 95% CI 19.0 to 20.7%, P < 0.05, Fig. 1 ). In addition, serum glycated albumin level correlated significantly with the number of diseased vessels in Group II (Spearman r = 0.19, P = 0.01), when statistically considering Group I patients as having 0-vessel disease. Although glycated albumin correlated well with HbA1c values in diabetic patients ( r = 0.799, P < 0.001), HbA1c levels did not differ significantly between Group I and Group II, neither was it related to the severity of CAD ( r = 0.13, P = 0.095). Serum glycated albumin level was greatly increased in diabetic patients with moderate renal insufficiency (21.7%, 95% CI 20.5 to 22.7%) compared to those with mild renal insufficiency (20.4%, 95% CI 19.1 to 20.8, P < 0.05) and normal renal function (19.8%, 95% CI 17.8 to 21.1%, P < 0.05) ( Fig. 2 ) and correlated significantly with CrCl stages (Spearman r = \u2212 0.12, P = 0.03), whereas HbA1c concentration was not significantly related to renal functional status (Spearman r = \u2212 0.1, P = 0.15). Serum hsCRP and TNF-\u03b1 levels Serum hsCRP and TNF-\u03b1 levels were significantly higher in Group II than in controls and Group I ( Table 2 ), and both correlated significantly with number of diseased vessels in Group II (Spearman r = 0.259, P = 0.001 and r = 0.16, P = 0.006, respectively). In addition, serum hsCRP and TNF-\u03b1 levels were significantly elevated in patients with mild (22.4\u00a0mg/L, 95% CI 16.7 to 27.8\u00a0mg/L and 105\u00a0pg/mL, 95% CI 88 to 119\u00a0pg/mL, respectively, both P < 0.05) and moderate renal insufficiency (24.2\u00a0mg/L, 95% CI 18.8 to 30.1\u00a0mg/L and 122\u00a0pg/mL, 95% CI 101 to 141\u00a0pg/mL, respectively, both P < 0.05), compared to diabetic patients with normal renal function (10.2\u00a0mg/L, 95% CI 6.5 to 13.5\u00a0mg/L and 78\u00a0pg/mL, 95% CI 58 to 99\u00a0pg/mL, respectively) ( Fig. 2 ). Serum hsCRP and TNF-\u03b1 levels were inversely related to CrCl stages (Spearman r = \u2212 0.263, P < 0.001 and r = \u2212 0.16, P = 0.01). However, serum glycated albumin level did not correlate with serum hsCRP or TNF-\u03b1 concentrations in T2DM patients with CAD and those with renal dysfunction. Multivariate regression analysis Multivariate regression analysis revealed that older age, male gender, glycated albumin, hsCRP, TNF-\u03b1 and Lp(a) were independent risk factors for CAD, and older age, hypertension and glycated albumin were for renal insufficiency in patients with T2DM ( Fig. 3 ). A serum glycated albumin level \u2265 20% was associated with 2.9-fold increase in risk of CAD ( P < 0.001) and the value \u2265 21% was for 1.95-fold increase in risk of moderate renal insufficiency (CrCl < 60\u00a0mL/min, P = 0.024) in these patients. Discussion Vascular disease that affects both micro- and macro-vasculature is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Increasing evidence from both in vivo and in vitro studies has emphasized that augmented levels of AGEs and Amadori-modified products and subsequent impact of these reactive molecules play a critical role in the development of coronary and renal complications in diabetes [1\u20133,5\u20137] . Glycated albumin is a predominant form of early glycated proteins in vivo and reveals close relation to inflammation. It has been shown to be an important risk factor for atherogenesis and renal impairment in diabetes, besides being as a marker for evaluating glycemic control and glycation load in vivo. Determination of risk factors and cytokines, like serum levels of glycated albumin, hsCRP and TNF-\u03b1, might offer a tool to assess diabetic patients at high risk of complications. The present study has shown that serum glycated albumin level was significantly increased in T2DM patients particularly when they developed CAD or renal insufficiency. In addition, serum glycated albumin level correlated significantly with number of diseased coronary arteries and CrCl stages in these patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that serum glycated albumin level was an independent risk factor for CAD and renal insufficiency in diabetes. These results emphasize the understandings that Amadori-modified products and other potential AGEs formed in the same hyperglycemic environment contribute to the development of diabetic complications. Chronic vascular complications of diabetes (nephropathy, retinopathy and accelerated atherosclerosis) are major causes of morbidity and premature mortality. Despite more widespread availability of intensive diabetes management, approximately one-third patients with diabetes develop severe complications and 70% die of atherosclerosis-related diseases. Because atherosclerosis is a chronic condition commencing in youth and up to 30% of diabetic patients with CAD experience silent ischemia, surrogate measures of vascular disease are crucial for early identification of diabetic patients with vascular damage and monitoring efficacy of interventions. Although several non-invasive diagnostic modalities for CAD are available, few have been validated in diabetic populations. With this regard, determination of serum glycated albumin level seems to be an alternative option, enabling a reduction in economic burden of vascular complication detection. Measurement of blood HbA1c level has been widely used to evaluate glycemic control in diabetic patients. We found significant correlation between serum glycated albumin and HbA1c levels in this studies ( r = 0.799, P < 0.001), but the latter was less sensitive to assess the presence and severity of coronary vasculopathies and disparities of renal impairment in diabetic patients, as difference was not statistically significant in serum HbA1c level between T2DM patients with and without CAD and among CAD subgroups, neither was the difference among patients with varying renal functional status. In contrast, measurement of serum glycated albumin levels was able to ascertain the disparity and correlated with the severity of CAD and renal insufficiency in the same cohort of patients. In previous studies, glycated albumin was found to be more strongly related to arterial stiffness than HbA1c in young type 1 diabetic individuals [24] , supporting the clinical significance of glycated albumin determination. Another report demonstrated the association of serum HbA1c level with the severity of CAD in diabetic patients [25] , which is different from our results. This may largely be explained by their definition of CAD being \u2265 50% stenosis in an artery of coronary angiogram, while ours was \u2265 70% luminal diameter narrowing, resulting in some diabetic patients with moderate stenosis being included in the non-CAD group and thereby diminishing the difference in HbA1c levels between diabetic patients with and without CAD. Other studies have shown that serum glycated albumin level plateaued several weeks in diabetic patients in whom serum glucose level was initially poorly controlled and then intensive insulin management was used to rapidly bring glucose levels under control, while serum HbA1c level was still falling [26] . Similarly, when assessing blood glucose control based solely on HbA1c in diabetic patients with end-stage chronic renal diseases or anemia, erroneous results may be obtained. Measurement of glycated albumin can be used instead because of its level in relation to blood glucose control well matching real status in patients, whereas HbA1c level was lower than indicated by blood glucose control [27,28] . Taken together, these results indicate that determination of serum glycated albumin level appears to be a useful marker for predicting the presence and severity of major diabetic complications, and also a valuable adjunct to HbA1c measurement in reflecting short-term glycemic control. In our study, serum glycated albumin level was greatly increased in T2DM patients with CAD and moderate renal insufficiency. As daily angiographic examination may not be performed in patients with severe renal failure, the actual serum glycated albumin level could be further higher if diabetic patients with severe or end-stage renal failure were included. In addition, Group I patients (T2DM alone) underwent coronary angiographic examination mostly because of their symptoms although their angiographic results did not fulfil the diagnostic criteria for CAD. We assume that the difference in serum levels of glycated albumin, hsCRP and TNF-\u03b1 could be greater between pure diabetic controls and diabetic patients with complications. Both CRP and TNF-\u03b1 have been thought to be the key cytokines in the process of cardiovascular diseases. We found that serum hsCRP and TNF-\u03b1 levels were significantly increased in T2DM patients with CAD or renal insufficiency. Serum hsCRP and TNF-\u03b1 levels correlated significantly with the number of diseased coronary arteries and were inversely related to CrCl stages. These results suggest that inflammatory cytokines are greatly activated in the late stages of pathophysiologic process in diabetes and generate rampant contributions to atherogenesis and renal dysfunction [29\u201333] and support the concept that optimal anti-inflammatory interventions should be pursued to antagonize pathogenic progression of diabetic vascular complications. In this study, multivariate analysis revealed that serum levels of glycated albumin, hsCRP, TNF-\u03b1 and Lp(a) were independent predictor of CAD, whereas traditional risk factors like HDL-C and LDL-C were not. This may be explained by the fact that majority of our patients have been receiving lipid-lowering agents. However, there have been less effective medications for lowering serum Lp(a) level, and Lp(a) is less sensitive to statin treatment. Hypertension also entered the model as an independent risk factor of renal insufficiency in diabetes, indicating that systemic pressure overload seems to be crucial in causing renal damage. Our present study suggests that Amadori-modified products including glycated albumin may be therapeutic targets in the prevention of vascular complications in diabetes. Approaches regarding reduction of substrate, inhibition of formative pathways and breakdown of preformed modified products hold promise as a valuable therapeutic adjunct for hypoglycemic treatments. Previous studies have indicated that therapeutic intervention to reduce and inhibit serum glycated albumin level can arrest the evolution of diabetic nephropathy independent of hypoglycemic therapy [34] . In summary, this study demonstrated significantly elevated serum levels of glycated albumin, hsCRP and TNF-\u03b1 in T2DM patients with CAD and renal insufficiency. Glycated albumin is an independent risk factor for both CAD and renal damage. Determination of serum glycated albumin and inflammatory cytokine levels may be used as surrogate measures to predict the presence and severity of vascular and renal complications in patients with T2DM.

        "abstract": "Background: Glycated albumin is the predominant circulating Amadori-type glycated protein in vivo and plays a major role in the development of diabetic vascular complications. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between increased serum glycated albumin level and the presence and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods and Results: In a total of 320 consecutive patients with T2DM, coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries in 83 patients (control group) and significant coronary stenosis (\u226570% luminal diameter narrowing) in 237, of whom 51 patients had 1-vessel disease (Group I), 80 had 2-vessel disease (Group II), and 106 had 3-vessel disease (Group III). Serum glycated albumin, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 levels, lipid profile, and renal function were measured. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the relative risk of serum glycated albumin level for the presence and severity of CAD. Multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis was done to identify independent determinants of the glycated albumin level. Serum glycated albumin (21.2\u00b15.3% vs 19.4\u00b14.3%, p=0.005) and TNF-\u03b1 levels (123\u00b1115 pg/ml vs 65\u00b159 pg/ml, p<0.001) were significantly higher in patients with CAD than in controls, but serum HbAlc level did not significantly differ between them (7.6\u00b11.3% vs 7.4\u00b11.2%, p=0.19). There was a significant difference in serum glycated albumin level between Groups I and III (19.5\u00b13.3% vs 21.8\u00b15.7%, p<0.001). The serum glycated albumin level correlated with the number of diseased arteries (Spearman r=0.205, p<0.001), and was closely related to serum levels on admission of glucose (r=0.495, p<0.001), TNF-\u03b1 (r=0.123, p=0.028), blood urea nitrogen (r=0.167, p=0.004), triglycerides (r=0.129, p=0.021), and HbA1c (r=0.795, p<0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated that serum levels of glucose (p<0.0001), TNF-\u03b1 (p=0.001), blood urea nitrogen (p=0.004) and triglycerides (p= 0.035) were independent determinants for glycated albumin. Logistic regression analysis revealed that glycated albumin \u226519% (odds ratio (OR) 2.9, p<0.001) was an independent predictor for CAD and glycated albumin =21% (OR 2.3, p=0.032) for 3-vessel disease prediction. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for glycated albumin (0.620, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.548 to 0.691, p=0.001) was superior to that for HbA1c (0.543, 95% CI 0.473 to 0.613, p=0.243). Conclusions: An increased serum level of glycated albumin is associated with the presence and severity of CAD, and may be useful in screening patients with T2DM.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major vascular complication of diabetes mellitus and reveals high mortality. Up to 30% of diabetic patients with myocardial ischemia remain asymptomatic and are associated with worse prognosis compared to non-diabetic counterpart, which warrants routine screening for CAD in diabetic population. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical value of serum glycated albumin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels in predicting the presence of CAD in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Three hundred and twenty-four patients with type 2 diabetes were divided into two groups based on presence (CAD group, n = 241) or absence (control group, n = 83) of angiographically-documented CAD (lumen diameter narrowing \u226570%). Serum levels of glycated albumin and hs-CRP as well as serum concentrations of glucose, lipids, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and uric acid were measured in both groups. Predictors of CAD were determined using multivariate logistic regression model and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: Serum glycated albumin and hs-CRP levels were significantly increased in diabetic patients with CAD. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that male gender, age, serum levels of glycated albumin, hs-CRP, creatinine and lipoprotein (a) were independent predictors for CAD. Areas under the curve of glycated albumin and hs-CRP and for regression model were 0.654 (95%CI 0.579\u20130.730, P < 0.001), 0.721 (95%CI 0.658\u20130.785, P < 0.001) and 0.824 (95% CI 0.768\u20130.879, P < 0.001), respectively. The optimal values of cut-off point were 18.7% (sensitivity 67.9%, specificity 60.0%) for glycated albumin and 5.2 mg/l (sensitivity 72.2%, specificity 60.0%) for hs-CRP to predict CAD. Logistic regression model was defined as: P/(1-P) = EXP(-1.5 + 1.265 gender + 0.812 age + 1.24 glycated albumin + 0.953 hs-CRP + 0.902 lipoprotein(a) + 1.918 creatinine). The optimal probability value for predicting CAD in type 2 diabetic patients was 0.648 (sensitivity 82.3%, specificity 68.6%). CONCLUSION: Serum glycated albumin and hs-CRP levels were significantly elevated in patients with type 2 diabetes and CAD. The logistic regression model incorporating with glycated albumin, hs-CRP and other major risk factors of atherosclerosis may be useful for screening CAD in patients with type 2 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a monocarboxypeptidase which metabolizes angiotensin II (Ang II) to generate Ang-(1-7), has been shown to prevent cardiac hypertrophy and injury but the mechanism remains elusive. Irbesartan has the dual actions of angiotensin receptor blockade and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) activation. We hypothesized that irbesartan would exert its protective effects on ACE2 deficiency-mediated myocardial fibrosis and cardiac injury via the PPAR\u03b3 signaling.10-week-old ACE2 knockout (ACE2KO; Ace2(-/y)) mice received daily with irbesartan (50 mg/kg) or saline for 2 weeks. The wild-type mice (Ace2(+/y)) were used to the normal controls. We examined changes in myocardial ultrastructure, fibrosis-related genes and pathological signaling by real-time PCR gene array, Western blotting, Masson trichrome staining and transmission electron microscope analyses, respectively.Compared with the Ace2(+/y) mice, cardiac expression of PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 were reduced in Ace2(-/y) mice and the myocardial collagen volume fraction (CVF) and expression of fibrosis-related genes were increased, including transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF\u03b21), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), collagen I and collagen III. Moreover, ACE2 deficiency triggered cardiac hypertrophy, increased myocardial fibrosis and adverse ultrastructure injury in ACE2KO hearts with higher levels of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), without affecting cardiac systolic function. Intriguingly, treatment with irbesartan significantly reversed ACE2 deficiency-mediated pathological hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis in Ace2(-/y) mice linked with enhancement of plasma Ang-(1-7) level and downregulation of AT1 receptor in heart. Consistent with attenuation of myocardial fibrosis and ultrastructure injury, the myocardial CVF and levels of ANF, TGF\u03b21, CTGF, collagen I, collagen III and phosphorylated ERK1/2 were lower, and expression of PPAR\u03b3 was higher in ACE2KO mice in response to irbesartan treatment, without affecting cardiac expression of PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b4, \u03b2-myosin heavy chain, TGF\u03b22 and fibronectin.We conclude that irbesartan prevents ACE2 deficiency-mediated pathological hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis in ACE2 mutant mice via activation of the PPAR\u03b3 signaling and suppression of the TGF\u03b2-CTGF-ERK signaling, resulting in attenuation of myocardial injury. Drugs targeting ACE2 and PPAR\u03b3 represent potential candidates to prevent and treat myocardial injury and related cardiac disorders.",

        "abstract": "This study was designed to establish a rat model of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) by calcium chloride (CaCl(2))-induced arterial injury and to explore the potential role of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their endogenous inhibitors (TIMPs) in TAA formation.Thoracic aorta of male Sprague-Dawley rats was exposed to 0.5M CaCl(2) or normal saline (NaCl). After 12weeks, animals were euthanized, and CaCl(2)-treated, CaCl(2)-untreated (n=12) and NaCl-treated aortic segments (n=12) were collected for histological and molecular assessments. MMP-TIMP and ADAM mRNAs were semi-quantitatively analyzed and protein expressions were determined by immunohistochemistry.Despite similar external diameters among CaCl(2)-treated, non-CaCl(2)-treated and NaCl-treated segments, aneurymal alteration (n=6, 50%), media degeneration with regional disruption, fragmentation of elastic fiber, and increased collagen deposition (n=12, 100%) were demonstrated in CaCl(2)-treated segments. MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 mRNA levels were increased in CaCl(2)-treated segments (all p<0.01), with trends of elevation in CaCl(2)-untreated segments, as compared with NaCl-treated segments. Immunohistochemistry displayed significantly increased expressions of MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 (all p<0.01) in intima and media for CaCl(2)-treated segments. TIMP mRNA and tissue levels did not differ obviously among the three aortic segments.This study establishes a TAA model by periarterial CaCl(2) exposure in rats, and demonstrates a significant elevation of expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling.",

        "abstract": "The researches attempting to associate the PPAR\u03b3 C161T polymorphism with coronary artery disease (CAD) yielded complicated and contradictory results. We aimed for more precise estimate of the relationship and conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis. Publications written in English or Chinese were screened in MEDLINE, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang and CBM. Data on 11 studies including 3,020 cases and 2,853 controls were extracted. A random-effects model was available to synthesize the inconsistent outcomes of the individual studies, while addressing between-study heterogeneity and publication bias. The PPAR\u03b3 C161T polymorphism followed Hard-Weinberg Equilibrium for all studies (P > 0.05).Overall, there was no evidence for a significant association under all genetic models but with distinct heterogeneity (T vs. C: P = 0.29, OR = 0.91, 95 %CI 0.77-1.08, P heterogeneity = 0.004, I (2) = 61.2 %). However, in the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, the T allele carriers showed a prominent 26 % risk reduction of CAD among Chinese (dominant genetic model: P = 0.03, 95 %CI 0.57-0.97, P heterogeneity = 0.03, I (2) = 56.1 %). After dividing into population source, the significance of CAD risk reduction was strengthened in hospital-based studies (allele comparison: P = 0.04, OR = 0.82, 95 %CI 0.67-1.00, P heterogeneity = 0.04, I (2) = 52.5 %; dominant model: P = 0.01, OR = 0.73, 95 %CI 0.57-0.92, P heterogeneity = 0.05, I (2) = 50.8 %). There was no obvious publication bias verified in the method of funnel plot and Egger's linear regression test (t = -0.11, P = 0.913). Taken together, our results revealed the PPAR\u03b3 C161T polymorphism might play a moderate protective effect on developing CAD among Chinese, but not among Caucasians.",

Methods ~(125)I-rhEndo was prepared by small amount of iodogen with repeated labeling. Radiochemical purity (RP) was tested by paper chromatographic analysis. Biological activity of ~(125)I rhEndo was evaluated according to cell proliferation assays and cell affinity assays. And pharmacokinetic parameters of ~(125)I-rhEndo in the SD rats were also analyzed. Results ~(125)I-rhEndo was prepared by 0.5 \u03bcg iodogen labeling thrice with its radio purity reached (94.7\u00b12.44)%. The labeling rate was 84%. Cell proliferation assays showed no significant difference between the ~(125)I-rhEndo and unlabeled rhEndo on inhibition of bFGF-induced ECV304 cell proliferation. In cell affinity assays ~(125)I-rhEndo could bind the endothelial cell surface receptors in compitition with unlabeled rhEndo. After intravenous injection with a single dose of 2 \u03bcg ~(125)I-rhEndo to rats, the plasma concentration-time curve fitted well to two-compartment model. The T_(1/2\u03b1)=(0.45\u00b10.12) h, T_(1/2\u03b2)=(19.53\u00b13.41) h, AUC=(484.57\u00b1137.99) ng\u00b7h\u00b7mL~(-1). Conclusion Small amount of iodogen repeated ~(125)I labeling assay did not influence the biological activity of rhEndo. After intravenous injection with a single dose of 2 \u03bcg ~(125)I-rhEndo to rats, its pharmacokinetic was in correspondence with two-compartment model with half life about 19 h.~(125)I labeling of rhEndo outlined the potential of this targeting agent for cancer imaging and therapy.",

        "abstract": "Coronary collateral circulation is an alternative source of blood supply to myocardium in the presence of advanced coronary artery disease. We sought to determine which clinical and angiographic variables are associated with collateral development in patients with stable angina and chronic total coronary occlusion.Demographic variables, biochemical measurements, and angiographic findings were collected from 478 patients with stable angina and chronic total coronary occlusion. The presence and extent of collaterals supplying the distal aspect of a total coronary occlusion from the contra-lateral vessel were graded from 0 to 3 according to the Rentrop scoring system.Low (Rentrop score of 0 or 1) and high (Rentrop score of 2 or 3) coronary collateralizations were detected in 186 and 292 patients, respectively. Despite similar age, cigarette smoking, and medical treatment, patients with low collateralization were female in a higher proportion and less hypertensive, and had higher rates of type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia than those with high collateralization (for all comparisons, P<0.05). In addition, patients with low collateralization exhibited more single-vessel disease, less right coronary artery occlusion, more impaired renal function, and higher serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) compared with those with high collateralization. Multivariate analysis revealed that age of \u226565 years, female gender, diabetes, no history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, moderate to severe renal dysfunction, single-vessel disease, and elevated hsCRP levels were independently associated with low coronary collateralization.Coronary collateralization was reduced in almost 40% of stable angina patients with chronic total occlusion, which was related to clinical and angiographic factors. The impact of coronary collateralization on outcomes after revascularization needs further investigation.",

        "abstract": "Lymphotoxin-alpha (LTA), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerosis. Meanwhile, association of some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of LTA gene with coronary artery disease (CAD) has been evaluated; however, the results are irreproducible. We therefore investigated the relationship between four SNPs of LTA gene and CAD in Han Chinese: G+10A (rs1800683, 5'-untranslated region), A+80C (rs2239704, 5'-untranslated region), T+496C (Cys13Arg, rs2229094, exon 2), and C+804A (Thr26Asn, rs1041981, exon 3). Genotyping was performed in 438 CAD patients and 330 healthy controls. Single-locus analysis showed that the genotype and allele frequencies of G+10A polymorphism exhibited marginal differences between CAD patients and controls, although no statistical significance was observed after the Bonferroni correction. Logistic regression analysis revealed that GG genotype of G+10A polymorphism was significantly associated with the risk of CAD under the dominant mode, whereas no significant association was detected between A+80C polymorphism and CAD. In contrast, individuals carrying TT or TC genotype of T+496C polymorphism showed a decreased CAD risk relative to those with CC genotype under the recessive mode. Likewise, CC genotype of C+804A polymorphism was associated with a protective effect on CAD under the dominant mode. Further, in haplotype analysis, the haplotype G-C-T-C (in order of rs1800683, rs2239704, rs2229094 and rs1041981) was significantly associated with a decreased risk of CAD after assigning the most common haplotype A-C-T-A as a reference. In conclusion, we show a protective effect of the haplotype G-C-T-C on the occurrence of CAD, suggesting the involvement of LTA in CAD pathogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Early detection of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is clinically important with respect to blood pressure control, prevention of renal insufficiency, and even improving survival. We investigated whether the presence of significant ARAS (luminal diameter narrowing \u226570%) could be predicted using a logistic regression model before coronary angiography/intervention.Initially, we developed a logistic regression model for detecting significant ARAS based upon clinical and angiographic features and biochemical measurements in a cohort of 1813 patients undergoing transfemoral coronary and renal angiography. This model was then prospectively applied to an additional 495 patients who received transradial renal angiography to ascertain its predictive accuracy for the presence of significant ARAS.Multivariate regression analysis revealed that older age (\u226565 years), resistant hypertension, type 2 diabetes, creatinine clearance (Ccr) \u226460 ml/min, and multivessel coronary disease were independent predictors for significant ARAS. A logistic regression model for detecting ARAS by incorporating conventional risk factors and multivessel coronary disease was generated as: P/(1-P)=exp(-2.618+1.112[age\u226565 years]+1.891[resistant hypertension]+0.453[type 2 diabetes]+0.587[Ccr\u226460 ml/min]+2.254[multivessel coronary disease]). When this regression model was prospectively applied to the additional 495 patients undergoing transradial coronary and renal angiography, significant ARAS could be detected with a sensitivity of 81.2%, specificity of 88.9%, and positive and negative predictive accuracies of 53.8% and 96.7%, respectively.The logistic regression model generated in this study may be useful for screening for significant ARAS in patients undergoing transradial coronary angiography/intervention.",

        "abstract": "Macrophage is a major contributor to the development of atherosclerosis by taking up deposited lipoprotein and eliciting local inflammation. Previously, we and others have shown C1q/TNF-related proteins (CTRPs) play diverse roles in vascular functions. In this study, we sought to investigate the changes in CTRP expression levels during vital biological processes in macrophages and their relation to inflammatory responses.Western blot and real-time PCR were performed to analyze CTRPs expression levels in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, primary macrophages and lipid-laden foam cells. Mechanisms that regulate CTPR1 expression were further investigated by bioinformatic analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to measure the concentration of inflammatory cytokines.We found that almost all CTRPs were significantly increased in primary human macrophages after differentiation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In particular, CTRP1 was further up-regulated upon exposure to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) in a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation also confirmed the presence of PPAR-\u03b3 in the CTRP1 promoter after oxLDL treatment. Stimulation of CTRP1 led to markedly enhanced secretion of pro-atherogenic factors, including MCP-1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6, whereas oxLDL-induced inflammatory cytokine production was significantly attenuated after the treatment with CTRP1 neutralizing antibody.These data suggest an essential role of CTRP1 in linking dysregulation of lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses in macrophages.",

Methods: Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (-329G>A, rs10399931; -247C>T, rs10399805; -131G>C, rs4950928) in the CHI3L1 promoter were determined in 213 consecutive patients with angiographically documented CAD (luminal diameter stenosis \u226550%) and 248 normal controls. Coronary cumulative obstruction score and number of diseased vessels represent the severity of CAD. Serum YKL-40 levels were assessed using an ELISA kit. Results: Patients with CAD had remarkably higher serum YKL-40 levels compared to controls (p<0.001). There was no difference in the allele, genotype and haplotype distribution of these three SNPs between controls and CAD patients. The minor alleles of CHI3L1-329G>A and -131G>C were significantly associated with decreased serum YKL-40 levels in both controls (p= 0.001 and p<0.001, respectively) and CAD patients (p= 0.007 and p<0.001, respectively), whereas CHI3L1-247C>T had no appreciable effect. None of these genetic variants and haplotypes was associated with severity of angiographic CAD.

        "abstract": "Background: The cardioprotective effects of soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE) have not been evaluated in large animals and the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of intra-coronary administration of sRAGE on left ventricular function and myocardial remodeling in a porcine model of ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Methods: Ten male minipigs with I/R injury were randomly allocated to receive intra-coronary administration of sRAGE (sRAGE group, n=5) or saline (control group, n=5). Echocardiography was performed before and 2 months after infarction. Myocardial expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 was determined by immunohistochemistry and fibrosis was evaluated by Sirius red staining. Results: As compared with the baseline values in the control animals, left ventricular end-diastolic volume (from (19.5\u00b15.1) to (32.3\u00b15.6) ml, P <0.05) and end-systolic volume (from (8.3\u00b13.2) to (15.2\u00b14.1) ml, P <0.05) were significantly increased, whereas ejection fraction was decreased (from (61.6\u00b113.3)% to (50.2\u00b111.9)%, P <0.05). No obvious change in these parameters was observed in the sRAGE group. Myocardial expression of TGF-\u03b21 was significantly elevated in the infarct and non-infarct regions in the control group, as compared with sRAGE group (both P <0.01). Fibrotic lesions were consistently more prominent in the infarct region of the myocardium in the control animals (P <0.05). Conclusion: Intra-coronary sRAGE administration attenuates RAGE-mediated myocardial fibrosis and I/R injury through a TGF-\u03b21-dependent mechanism, suggesting a clinical potential in treating RAGE/ligand-associated cardiovascular diseases.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To investigate the effect of rapamycin eluting coronary stent for inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia in diabetic porcine model.Methods:There were two groups in this study.Diabetic group,n=12,diabetic porcine model was established by a single dose of streptozotocin,and rapamycin eluting coronary stents were randomly implanted into 2 of the major epicardial coronary arteries.Control group,n=12,with non-diabetic porcine.The degree of neointimal hyperplasia evaluated by coronary angiography,intravascular ultrasound(IVUS) and histopathology were compared between two groups respectively at 6 months of the event. Results:The distribution of vessels received stents,reference vessel diameters and post-procedural minimal luminal diameter were comparable between two groups.All animals received angiographic follow-up at 6 months of time.In Diabetic group,the degree of stent stenosis(35.6%\u00b19.2% vs.7.9%\u00b13.1%,P<0.001),late lumen loss(0.32\u00b10.09 mm vs.0.09\u00b10.04 mm,P<0.001),the thickness of neointima by IVUS examination(0.35\u00b10.12 mm vs.0.11\u00b10.08 mm,P<0.05) and area stenosis by IVUS(1.29\u00b10.51 mm2 vs.0.26\u00b10.11 mm2,P<0.001);and histopathological examination(1.24\u00b10.76 mm2 vs.0.19\u00b10.08mm2,P<0.05) were significantly higher than those in Control group.Conclusion: The neointimal hyperplasia after rapamycin eluting stent implantation was significantly severe in the diabetic porcine models than those in non-diabetic ones.",

        "abstract": "Observational and experimental studies have thus far been unable to resolve whether the CYBA C242T polymorphism is associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). Therefore, we undertook a comprehensive meta-analysis to more precisely evaluate the influence of this polymorphism on CAD and potential biases.We screened MEDLINE, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang and CBM up to January 2013 and extracted data from 22 studies with 9,279 CAD patients and 9,349 controls. A random-effects model was exploited to synthesize the inconsistent outcomes of the individual studies, while addressing between-study heterogeneity and publication bias.The CYBA C242T polymorphism conformed to Hard-Weinberg Equilibrium for all studies (P>0.05). Overall comparison of the T allele with the C allele produced a non-significant risk estimate for CAD but with striking heterogeneity (T versus C: P\u200a=\u200a0.87, OR\u200a=\u200a0.99, 95%CI 0.89-1.11, P(heterogeneity)<0.0001, I\u00b2\u200a=\u200a67.8%). However, subgroup analysis by ethnicity documented that the T allele carriers had a marginal risk increase (21%) of CAD among Caucasians (recessive genetic model: P\u200a=\u200a0.05, 95%CI 1.00-1.46, P(heterogeneity)\u200a=\u200a0.15, I\u00b2\u200a=\u200a29.1%). Then data were divided into study design, the significance of CAD risk increase was substantially strengthened in matched case-control studies (allele comparison: P\u200a=\u200a0.02, OR\u200a=\u200a1.13, 95%CI 1.02-1.26, P(heterogeneity)\u200a=\u200a0.24, I\u00b2\u200a=\u200a21.6%).Further meta-regression analysis identified that a large proportion of heterogeneity was explained by body mass index (BMI) (P\u200a=\u200a0.03, OR\u200a=\u200a1.07, 95%CI 1.01-1.15) and study design (P\u200a=\u200a0.03, OR\u200a=\u200a1.30, 95%CI 1.02-1.64).There was no obvious publication bias as verified by funnel plot and Egger's linear regression test (t\u200a=\u200a-0.25, P\u200a=\u200a0.81 for allele comparison).Taken together, our results suggested the CYBA C242T polymorphism might be a risk-conferring factor on developing CAD and BMI and study design were probable sources of between-study heterogeneity.",

Methods PCR-sequencing was performed to identify SNPs and to ascertain the distribution of SNPs. A case-control study was performed in 192 patients with essential hypertension and 185 healthy controls. Results Five SNPs were discovered in renin gene promoter region in length of 1 674 bp. RENP-1475 (G/A) polymorphism was almost in completely linkage disequlibrium with RENP/-1447(T/G),RENP/-1165(G/A) and RENP/-1135(T/G) polymorphisms. No statistical differences of genotype distributions and allele frequencies were found between essential hypertensive patients and healthy controls (P>0.05). The 5 SNPs belonged to a same haploid region and formed 3 haplotypes. Haplotype analysis revealed that there was no significant difference in haplotype distribution between essential hypertension patients and healthy controls (P>0.05). Conclusions Hereditary variations in renin gene promoter region may not be the vulnerable factor of essential hypertension in South-eastern Han population.",

Methods Polymorphisms at position -863(C/A),-308(G/A) and-238(G/A) in tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 gene promoter in 286 CHD patients (inlcuding 101 patients with myocardial infarction) and 202 healthy controls were determined by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Results The distribution of C-863A,G-308A and G-238A genotypes and allele frequencies were not significantly different between CHD group and control group (P> 0.05),and the same were seen between single coronary artery disease group and multiple coronary artery disease group. Further analysis showed that the distribution of polymorphism genotypes G-308A and G-238A was different between myocardial infarction (MI) group and control group (P=0.041 and 0.023),the carrier rate of -308AA was significantly lower in MI group than that in control group. However,the difference of allele frequencies between MI group and control group was not statistically significant (P >0.05).

        "abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common heart disease worldwide. Association of CAD with variants in the myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) gene, the first identified CAD-causing gene, has attracted special attention but the results are controversial. We aimed to evaluate this genetic association via a case-control study and meta-analysis.We performed a case-control association study to investigate the relationship between variations in exon 11 of MEF2A gene and CAD in 1045 sporadic patients and 1008 controls enrolled angiographically among southern Chinese population, and then the data from this study were compared and discussed in a systematic review and meta-analysis with all available published studies on MEF2A gene and CAD. In total, eight variants were identified (21-bp deletion, CAG repeats, CCG repeats, a CCA deletion and four SNPs). No significant link was observed between the common (CAG)(n) polymorphism and CAD, whereas the rare 21-bp deletion was detected only in five affected individuals. The meta-analysis of (CAG)(n) polymorphism and CAD risk, including nine studies with 3801 CAD patients and 4020 controls, also provided no convincing evidence for the genetic association, even upon stratification by race (mainly Whites and Chinese). However, the 21-bp deletion was regarded as a potentially logical, albeit undetermined, candidate for CAD in the following systematic review.Our findings failed to demonstrate a correlation between (CAG)(n) polymorphism with CAD, however, we concluded that the rare 21-bp deletion might have a more compelling effect on CAD than the common (CAG)(n) polymorphism, and MEF2A genetic variant might be a rare but specific cause of CAD/MI.",

        "abstract": "Left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) occurs with myocardial ischemia and coronary artery disease (CAD). The natriuretic peptide system has compensatory vasodilatory, natriuretic and paracrine effects on LVD and subsequent heart failure. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between natriuretic peptide polymorphisms and risk of LVD in CAD patients.We recruited 747 consecutive Southern Han Chinese patients with angiographically confirmed CAD, 201 had a reduced left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF \u226445%, LVD group) and 546 had a preserved left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF >45%). The reduced and preserved LVEF groups were matched by gender and age. Taqman assays were performed to identify five polymorphisms in the NPPA-NPPB locus (rs5065, rs5063, rs632793, rs198388 and rs198389).Single-locus analyses found no significant difference in the allele and genotype frequencies of the reduced and preserved LVEF group, even after adjusting for confounding factors. Subgroup analyses performed by hyperlipidemia (HLP) demonstrated 3 polymorphisms, rs632793 (OR = 0.31, 95% CI 0.1-0.93, P = 0.04), rs198388 (OR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.09-0.79, P = 0.02) and rs198389 (OR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.09-0.80, P = 0.02) were associated with the reduced risk of LVD. No CAD-susceptible haplotypes were identified. Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis did not detect any gene-to-gene interactions among the five loci. Three loci (rs5063, rs632793 and rs198388) formed the best model with the maximum testing accuracy (39.89%) and cross-validation consistency (10/10).Three NPPA-NPPB polymorphisms (rs632793, rs198388 and rs198389) were associated with reduced risk of LVD in CAD patients with HLP.",

        "abstract": "Recent randomized controlled trials have challenged the concept that increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) risk reduction. The causal role of HDL-C in the development of atherosclerosis remains unclear. To increase precision and to minimize residual confounding, we exploited the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)-TaqIB polymorphism as an instrument based on Mendelian randomization.The Mendelian randomization analysis was performed by two steps. First, we conducted a meta-analysis of 47 studies, including 23,928 cases and 27,068 controls, to quantify the relationship between the TaqIB polymorphism and the CAD risk. Next, the association between the TaqIB polymorphism and HDL-C was assessed among 5,929 Caucasians. We further employed Mendelian randomization to evaluate the causal effect of HDL-C on CAD based on the findings from the meta-analysis.The overall comparison of the B2 allele with the B1 allele yielded a significant risk reduction of CAD (P\u2009<\u20090.0001; OR\u2009=\u20090.88; 95% CI: 0.84-0.92) with substantial between-study heterogeneity (I\u00b2\u2009=\u200955.2%; P(heterogeneity) <0.0001). The result was not materially changed after excluding the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE)-violation studies. Compared with B1B1 homozygotes, Caucasian carriers of the B2 allele had a 0.25 mmol/L increase in HDL-C level (95% CI: 0.20-0.31; P <0.0001; I\u00b2\u2009=\u20090; P(heterogeneity) =0.87). However, a 1 standard deviation (SD) elevation in HDL-C levels due to the TaqIB polymorphism, was marginal associated with CAD risk (OR =0.79; 95% CI: 0.54-1.03; P =0.08).Taken together, our results lend support to the concept that increased HDL-C cannot be translated into a reduction in CAD risk.",

Methods: The data of MPV of patients with isolated MB confirmed by coronary angiography (MB group, n=326) and those with normal coronary angiographic findings (control group, n=334) were retrospectively analysed. All the study objectives were stratified by age and gender, and the differences in MPV were compared between subgroups. The risk factors of MB were explored by multivariate Logistic regression analysis. Results: There was no significant difference in MPV between MB group and control group [(8.88 \u00b1 1.27) fl. vs (8.78 \u00b1 1.27) fl, P > 0.05], and there was also no significant difference in MPV between the same gender of two groups (P > 0.05). The cutoff point of age was determined as 44 years with favorable sensitivity and specificity. In those aged no higher than 44 years, MPV in MB group was significantly higher than that in control group [(9.49 \u00b1 1.30) 11 vs (8.62 \u00b1 1.31) fl, P < 0.01], while there was no significant difference in MPV between two groups in the other age subgroups (P > 0.05). In those aged no higher than 44 years, multivariate regression analysis revealed that MB was significantly related to MPV (OR=1.71, 95% CI 1.16-2.51, P < 0.01), while was not related to gender, blood pressure and blood lipid (P > 0.05). Conclusion: MB may be associated with the increase of MPV, and the relevance may be more significant in young patients with MB.",

This study investigated the role of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in oxLDL-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines in SMCs both in vivo and in vitro. We found that the levels of TLR4, interleukin 1-\u03b2 (IL1-\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression were increased in the SMCs of atherosclerotic plaques in patients with femoral artery stenosis. In cultured primary arterial SMCs from wild type mice, oxLDL caused dose- and time-dependent increase in the expression levels of TLR4 and cytokines. These effects were significantly weakened in arterial SMCs derived from TLR4 knockout mice (TLR4-/-). Moreover, the secretion of inflammatory cytokines was blocked by TLR4-specific antibodies in primary SMCs. Ox-LDL induced activation of p38 and NF\u03baB was also inhibited in TLR4-/- primary SMCs or when treated with TLR4-specific antibodies. These results demonstrated that TLR4 is a crucial mediator in oxLDL-induced inflammatory cytokine expression and secretion, and p38 and NF\u03baB activation.",

We sought to estimate the inconsistent results by performing a comprehensive meta-analysis.Studies in English or Chinese publications were identified by screening MEDLINE, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang and CBM. 22 studies including 8948 cases and 14427 controls were selected. A random-effects model was applied to combine the divergent outcomes of the individual studies, while addressing between-study heterogeneity and publication bias.The Pro12Ala polymorphism of control population followed Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for all studies (P>0.05). Overall, a marginal increased risk of CAD under the recessive genetic model (AlaAla vs ProAla+ProPro: P = 0.04, OR = 1.31, 95%CI 1.01-1.69, P(heterogeneity) = 0.67, I(2) = 0%) and the homozygote comparison (AlaAla vs ProPro: P = 0.04,OR = 1.30, 95%CI 1.01-1.68, P(heterogeneity) = 0.68, I(2) = 0%) was observed. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, carriers of AlaAla homozygotes had a significant increased risk for CAD among Caucasians (AlaAla vs ProAla+ProPro: P = 0.01, OR = 1.45, 95%CI 1.08-1.96, P(heterogeneity) = 0.48, I(2) = 0%; AlaAla vs ProPro: P = 0.02,OR = 1.44, 95%CI 1.07-1.93, P(heterogeneity) = 0.46, I(2) = 0%).

The degree of collateralization was graded according to the Rentrop scoring system. Low (Rentrop score of 0 or 1) and high (Rentrop score of 2 or 3) coronary collateralization occurred in 161 and 242 patients, respectively. Serum levels of sVEGFR-1 and -2 were significantly elevated, in contrast, VEGF and PLGF levels were remarkably decreased in patients with low collateralization than in those with high collateralization (all P<0.05). Significant differences in sVEGFR-1, VEGF and PLGF levels was consistently detected between the low and high collateralization subgroups for patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) (for all comparisons, P<0.01). Multivariable regression analysis revealed that DM, dyslipidemia, elevated sVEGFR-1, and reduced VEGF and PLGF in serum were independently associated with a low degree of coronary collateralization.Increased serum sVEGFR-1 level is associated with poor coronary collateralization in patients with stable CAD. Type 2 DM is a predominant factor affecting collateral growth in these patients.",

The severity of CAD was evaluated by the number of significant CAD (>50% luminal diameter narrowing) and Gensini score.Plasma Fg was higher, but Fg/FDP ratio was lower in patients with significant CAD (n = 255) compared with those without (n = 89), due to a disproportionate increase in FDP. Fg and FDP correlated positively, while Fg/FDP ratio negatively, with the number of diseased coronary arteries and the tertile of Gensini score (all P values for trend < 0.01). After adjusting for age, sex, risk factors for CAD, lipid profiles, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c, creatinine, leukocyte count, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, Fg/FDP ratio remained an independent determinant for multivessel coronary disease (MVD) (odds ratio [OR], 0.869; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.788-0.958, P = 0.005) and high tertile of Gensini score (OR, 0.797, 95% CI, 0.682-0.930, P = 0.004).

        "abstract": "Copy number variations (CNVs), genomic duplication or deletion events occurring at larger than 1 kb scale, contribute to the complex diseases substantially. Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a major inherited risk factor for atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD). We investigated the association between a CNV of the Lp(a) (LPA) gene and CAD. The case-control study included 271 CAD patients and 207 controls diagnosed by coronary angiography. A taqman real-time fluorescence PCR based technique was developed according to the 2 \u00d7 2(-\u0394\u0394Ct\u00b1SD) calculation method. We detected LPA CNVs with a range of 1, 2 and 3. The 1 copy number carriers had a significantly reduced risk of CAD compared with those with 2 copy number after adjusting for the confounding factors (P < 0.001, OR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.23-0.64). Further stratified analyses suggested a significant protective effect of the 1 copy number in the elderly population (P = 0.008), females (P = 0.007) as well as in populations with non-hyperlipidemia (P = 0.003), hypertension (P = 0.001), non-smoking (P < 0.001) and high Lp(a) (\u2265 0.3 g/L) levels (P = 0.001). The 1 copy number of the LPA gene may be an independent protective factor of CAD in a southern Han Chinese population, particularly in females and the elderly.",

        "abstract": "Via sequencing the genes of apelin/angiotensin receptor-like 1 (apelin/APJ) pathway, we have recently identified and validated four common polymorphisms (rs3761581, rs56204867, rs7119375, and rs10501367) implicated in the development of hypertension. Extending these findings, we, in Chinese hypertensive patients, sought to investigate the association of these four polymorphisms and one additional promising candidate (rs9943582) from this pathway with the risk of developing coronary artery disease (CAD).Genotypes were obtained from 994 sporadic CAD patients and 708 age- and sex-matched controls. All participants were hypertensives and angiographically-confirmed. Data were analyzed by Haplo.Stats and multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) softwares. Genotype distributions of five examined polymorphisms satisfied Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls of both genders. Single-locus analyses exhibited no significant differences in the genotype/allele frequencies of examined polymorphisms between CAD patients and controls (P>0.05), even after controlling traditional cardiovascular confounders. In haplotype analyses, low-penetrance haplotype G-A (in order of rs56204867 and rs3761581 from apelin gene) was significantly overrepresented in controls (1.73%) relative to in CAD patients (0.4%) in males (P = 0.047). Further interaction analyses suggested an overall best MDR model including rs3761581 in males (P = 0.0408) and including rs7119375 and rs9943582 in females (P<0.0001), which were further substantiated in the classical logistical regression model.Our findings demonstrated a contributive role of low-penetrance haplotype in apelin gene on CAD in males, and more importantly, interactive effects of genetic defects in apelin/APJ pathway might confer a potential risk in Chinese hypertensive patients.",

Methods Two hundred and five patients with CAD who were followed up with coronary angiography were divided into non-PP group(n=134) and PP group(n=71).Coronary angiograms were assessed by quantitative coronary angiography and clinical files were documented.Besides,135 normal subjects were served as controls.All participants were characterized for adiponectin gene polymorphisms(-11377 C/G,+45 T/G,and +276 G/T) using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism(RFLP) analysis. Results Adiponectin-11377 G allele frequency of CAD patients was higher than that of control group(OR=1.49,95%CI=1.05~2.10,P=0.024),and the frequency in PP group was higher than that in non-PP group(OR=1.63,95%CI=1.07~2.50,P=0.024).A trend of significant frequency increase of-11377 G allele and genotype carrying G allele was observed among control group,non-PP group and PP group(P<0.05).There was a trend of significant increase in high density lipoprotein-cholesterol(HDL-C) among-11377 CC,CG and GG genotype(P<0.05).However,there was no significant difference in +45 T/G and +276 G/T SNP genotype and allele frequency among each group(P>0.05). Conclusion The-11377 C/G SNPs of adiponectin are associated with CAD and PP in East China Han population,which may partially be regulated by HDL-C.",

Methods Three hundred and sixty-four non-diabetic patients and 135 patients with type 2 diabetes underwent coronary angiography and received examination one year later. Twelve functional polymorphisms of MMPs and TIMPs were exmined by PCR-RFLP or by sequencing. Results The genotype distribution and allele frequency of -1612 5A/6A in MMP-3 were significantly different between patients with plaque progression and those without plaque progression in both diabetic and non-diabetic groups (all P<0.01). Statistical significance still existed in allele frequency after Bonferroni's correction of P value (both P<0.004 5). Genotype distribution and allele frequency of 3'UTR C/T in TIMP-4 were significantly different (both P<0.004 5) between plaque progression subgroup and non-plaque progression subgroup in the non-diabetic group and diabetic group (P<0.05). These polymorphisms were associated with decreased minimal lumen diameter in diabetes and/or increased cumulative coronary obstruction in DM group (all P<0.05). Multivariable regression analysis revealed that genotype 6A/6A of MMP-3 (OR=1.968,P=0.013 and OR=7.917,P=0.001,respectively ) and genotypes carrying allele T of TIMP-4 (OR=1.897,P=0.019 and OR=4.342,P=0.004,respectively) were independent determinants of plaque progression in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. Conclusion It is demonstrated that the polymorphisms of MMP-3 and TIMP-4 are associated with the progression of angiographic coronary in T2DM and non-diabetic patients.",

        "abstract": " Objective To evaluate the influence of the gene polymorphisms of matrix metalloproteinase(mmp)-1,-2,-3 and -9 on coronary atherosclerotic plaque progression. Methods During the period of January 2005-December 2008, 80 patients with coronary heart disease underwent two times coronary angiography at authors\u2019 hospital. Based on the angiographic findings, the patients were classified into plaque progression group (n = 31) and plaque non-progression group (n = 49). Coronary atherosclerotic plaque progression was arbitrarily defined as that the minimal lumen diameter (MLD) of coronary artery showed a decrease \u2265 0.4 mm on the second coronary angiography. The detailed history and clinical examination results were collected, including serum concentrations of lipid profiling, fasting glucose and hs-CRP. Genotypings for polymorphic variances of MMP-1 (-1607 G / GG), MMP-2 (-955 A / C), MMP-3 (-1612 5A / 6A ) and MMP-9 (-1562 C/T) were performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing analysis in two groups. Comparison of the clinical characteristics and polymorphisms between two groups was made to assess their effects on coronary atherosclerotic plaque progression. Results More female patients and patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were noted in patients with plaque progression compare to those with no progression (41.9% vs. 18.4%, P < 0.05 and 77.4% vs. 46.3%, P < 0.01, respectively). The serum hs-CRP level also significantly increased in group with plaque progression (0.26 \u00b1 0.44 mg / L vs. 0.02 \u00b1 0.14 mg / L, P < 0.01). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that serum hs-CRP concentration and ACS were independent risk factors of coronary atherosclerotic plaque progression (OR: 12.63,95% CI:1.45-110.29, P < 0.05 and OR:2.99,95% CI:1.04-8.63, P < 0.05, respectively). The frequencies of 6A / 6A genotype and 6A allele of MMP-3 promoter at location -1612 were significantly higher in group with plaque progression than that in group with no progression (87.1% vs. 53.1%, P < 0.01 and 93.5% vs. 75.5%, P < 0.01, respectively). However, no significant differences in the distribution of MMP-1, -2 and -9 polymorphisms existed between two groups. Conclusion ACS, feminine gender, high serum hs-CRP concentration and 5A / 6A polymorphism in the MMP-3 gene promoter are closely associated with coronary atherosclerotic plaque progression. In addition, 5A / 6A polymorphism of MMP-3 can be used as a marker for plaque progression.",

        "abstract": "Objective Human KCNE1 gene codes the\u03b2-subunit of I_ks potassium channel.We in- vestigated the association between arrhythmia and the potymorphisms of KCNE1 gene in Chinese Han popula- tion.Methods We included 197 patients with arrhythmia(case patients)and 104 normal individuals (control subjects),the case patients were divided into 3 subgroups:atrial fibrillation(n=111),supravent- ricular tachycardia(n=52),ventricular tachycardia(n=34).The genotype of KCNE1 was determined with polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing.Results KCNE1-S38G potymorphism was found both in arrhythmia patients and control subjects.The results showed an association between the KCNE1-S38G and ventricular tachycardia.The ventricular tachycardia group had a significantly higher A allele frequency than the control group(45.6% vs 26.9%,P\uff1c0.01).The distribution of three genotypes(A/A,A/G,G/G) were also significandy different between the two groups(P\uff1c0.05).The odds ratios for ventricular tachycar- dia in patients with A/A and A/G genotypes were 3.188(95%CI 1.307\uff5e7.771)and 3. 500(95% CI 1. 111\uff5e11.028),respectively,when compared with G/G patients.Corrected QT interval(QTc)and other clinical features were not significantly different between three genotypes in each group.Conclusion KC- NE1-S38G polymorphism is highly exist in Chinese Han population,A allele was more frequent in ventricular tachycardia patients than control subjects,this polymorphism may play a risk role on the pathogenesis of ven- tricular tachycardia.",

        "abstract": "Background: We investigated whether an additional intracoronary tirofiban bolus administration following upstream intravenous treatment could further improve myocardial reperfusion and clinical outcome in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods: A total of 453 eligible STEMI patients were randomly allocated to intracoronary bolus administration of tirofiban (10 \u03bcg/kg; n = 229) or saline (10 mL; n = 224) during primary PCI, followed by intravenous tirofiban infusion (0.15 \u03bcg/kg/min) for 24-36 h. Serum levels of P-selectin, vWF, CD40L and serum amyloid A (SAA) in the coronary sinus were measured before and after intracoronary bolus administration. The primary endpoint was ST-segment resolution (STR) at 90 min after the procedure. Second endpoints included corrected TIMI frame count (cTFC), left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction (EF), and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 30-day and 6-month follow-up. Results: Intracoronary tirofiban administration resulted in a higher rate of completed STR (59.0% vs. 44.6%, P = 0.002), lower cTFC (21.6 \u00b1 5.4 vs. 23.7 \u00b1 7.8, P = 0.048), and significantly reduced coronary sinus levels of P-selectin, vWF, CD40L and SAA. Patients treated with intracoronary tirofiban had a trend toward less MACE at 30 days (3.1% vs. 6.7%, P = 0.072). At 6 months, left ventricular end-systolic volume was smaller, EF was higher and MACE-free survival was improved (96.1% vs. 90.6%, P = 0.020) in the intracoronary tirofiban group. Conclusions: An additional intracoronary tirofiban bolus administration following upstream intravenous treatment reduces coronary circulatory platelet activation and inflammatory process, and significantly improves myocardial reperfusion and left ventricular function as well as 6-month MACE-free survival for STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the relationship between the genetic polymorphisms of the human cardiac sodium channel\u03b1subunit gene (voltage-gated sodium channel type V,SCN5A) and the occurrence of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia (IVA).Methods Genotyping for polymorphic variance of SCN5A gene was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and automated Genescan sequencing analysis in 21 unrelated Chinese IVA patients and 103 healthy controls.Results Ten genetic variations were found,and 8 of them manifested single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Among the polymorphic variations observed in this study,5 polymorphisms were reported for the first time,which were c. 1676C\uff1eT (p.Thr559Ile),c.6210C\uff1eT,c.6804C\uff1eT,c.7013T\uff1eA and c.7014C\uff1eT respectively.The detected SNPs allele frequencies in the both groups markedly accorded with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.Two novel variations,c.1676C\uff1eT (p. Thr559Ile) and c.6210C\uff1eT,were heterozygous in two different healthy controls,revealing a frequency of 0.005,but not in IVA patients.The allele frequences of two SNPs,c.87G\uff1eA (p.Ala29Ala) and c.1673A\uff1eG (p.His558Arg),were significantly higher in the male controls than those in the female controls(P=0.023,P=0.027).In addition,significant difference was noted in the allele frequency of c.87G\uff1eA between the female IVA patients (0.500) and the female controls (0.198) (P= 0.005).The allele frequency of c.1673A\uff1eG was significantly lower in the male IVA patients (0/20) than that in the male controls (0.175) (P=0.043).Conclusions Significant difference exists in the distribution of two SNPs c.87G\uff1eA and c.1673A\uff1eG between the males and the females in a Chinese Han population.The 87A allele might be associated with an increased risk of IVA in the female patients,and the 1673G allele may be protective against ventricular arrhythmia in the males. Further studies are needed to prove our findings.",

Methods One hundred and eleven patients with atrial fibrillation (patients group) and 101 normal individuals (control group) were included. The patients were divided into 4 subgroups: AF alone (n=30), hypertensive AF (n=39), coronary heart disease (CHD) concomitant with AF (n=14), and both hypertension and CHD concomitant with AF(n=28). The genotype of KCNE1 was determined with polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. Results No association between KCNE1-S38G and AF was found. The distributions of three genotypes (A/A, A/G, G/G) and two alleles (A and G) in the patients were not significantly different from those in the controls group. There was also no significant difference among the 4 subgroups. There was no significant difference of the corrected QT interval (QTc) among the three genotypes in the patients. Conclusions Although KCNE1-S38G allele is superior in the patients with atrial fibrillation to that in the controls, there was no significant difference between the two groups. KCNE1-S38G polymorphism may have significant ethnicity and region difference.",

        "abstract": "This study evaluated the potential effects of beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) and natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR) gene polymorphisms on the susceptibility to and the severity of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) in a Chinese cohort.Ten polymorphisms in the coding regions of beta1-AR, beta2-AR, beta3-AR, NPR1, and NPR2 were genotyped in 430 IDCM patients and 468 healthy subjects. Patients with IDCM were followed for 2 years. In multi-loci combined subtype analysis, the combined profile of beta-AR and NPR was significantly different between IDCM patients and controls (P < .0001), mainly influenced by 2 loci beta1-Ser49Gly and NPR2-C2077T, which were also associated with the severity of IDCM. In single-loci analysis, allele frequencies of beta1-Gly49, NPR1-Glu939, and NPR2-T2077 were higher in patients with IDCM than in controls. Genotypes carrying NPR2-T2077 allele showed 1.94-fold independent risk for IDCM phenotype than C2077 homozygote (P < .001). Carriers of the NPR2-T2077 or beta1-Gly49 variant had worse New York Heart Association functional class or echocardiographic results and elevated serum brain natriuretic peptide, experienced severe symptoms, and required intensive medications and frequent hospitalization for heart failure. Furthermore, synergistic interactions between NPR2-C2077T and beta1-Ser49Gly were detected by multifactor-dimensionality reduction method.This study suggests that NPR2-T2077 and beta1-Gly49 polymorphisms may be genetically synergistic adverse factors for the susceptibility to or the severity of IDCM.",

        "abstract": "Background: Glycated albumin (GA) has been shown to be a better indicator than glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in terms of severity of renal impairment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study aimed to determine whether elevated serum GA levels are associated with an increased risk for contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) and worse clinical outcome in patients with T2DM and at least moderate renal insufficiency (RI) undergoing coronary angiography. Methods: Serum levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), HbA1c and GA were measured in 1030 patients with T2DM and moderate to severe RI (eGFR 15-59 mL/min/1.73 m2). CI-AKI was defined as \u2265 25% increase in serum creatinine within 72 h after the procedure. Receiver-operating characteristic curve was constructed to assess the predictive value of GA, HbA1c and FBG for CI-AKI. Multivariable logistic regression model was developed to identify risk factors for CI-AKI, and Kaplan-Meier curve analysis was used to compare the rates of dialysis and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) during one-year follow-up. Results: The overall rate of CI-AKI was 11.1%. GA was significantly higher in patients with CI-AKI than in those without, and correlated positively with changes of renal function after the procedure. After adjusting for age, sex, left ventricular ejection fraction, multi-vessel disease, type and volume of contrast media, FBG, and HbA1c, GA remained an independent risk factor for CI-AKI. GA \u2265 21% was associated with increased rates of dialysis and MACE during one-year follow-up in patients with or without CI-AKI. Conclusions: Increased GA level serves as a valuable risk factor for CI-AKI and indicates poor one-year clinical outcome in patients with T2DM and moderate to severe RI. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The present study aimed to establish Chinese Guizhou minipig models with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes and characterize the animal models by analyzing inflammatory cytokine levels in aortic wall, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin-6 (IL-6).Twenty-two male Chinese Guizhou minipigs (age, 4 to 6 months; weight, 20 kg to 30 kg) were divided into STZ-induced diabetic group (n = 12) and control group (n = 10). STZ (125 mg/kg) was administrated to induce hyperglycemia and afterwards insulin was used to control fasting blood glucose levels below 10 mmol/L. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed before and one month after STZ administration and serum concentrations of alanine transaminase, asparagine transaminase, albumin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, lipids and white blood cell count were measured before and six months later. Animals in both groups were euthanized after six months and pancreas was examined immunohistochemically for islet beta cells. Aortic intima of diabetic minipigs and controls was analyzed for TNF-alpha level in tissue conditioned medium by Western blot. TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 mRNA levels in aortic intima were assayed by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).Significant elevation in serum glucose levels was observed one month and six months after STZ induction (P < 0.001) and markedly increased OGTT values were noted, compared with baseline data. The normal pancreas had many irregular sized islets and small clusters of islet beta cells, while in pancreas of diabetic minipigs islet beta cells almost disappeared. No statistical difference was notified in serum concentrations of biochemical examinations before and six months after STZ induction. Western blot demonstrated dramatically increased TNF-alpha level in aotic intima conditioned medium, and significant elevation of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 mRNA levels was revealed by RT-PCR.The present study has established Chinese Guizhou minipig models with STZ-induced diabetes. Inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6) significantly elevated in aortic intima of diabetic minipigs.",

        "abstract": "Background: Mutations of human cardiac sodium channel \u03b1 subunit gene (SCN5A) have been implicated in risk of various cardiac arrhythmias. The present study aimed to investigate whether SCN5A polymorphism was related to the occurrence of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia (IVA) in Chinese Han patients. Methods and Results: Genotyping for polymorphic variance of SCN5A was performed by polymerase chain reaction and automated gene scan sequencing analysis in 31 unrelated Chinese patients with IVA (IVA group) and 103 healthy controls (control group). The allele frequencies of c.87G>A (p.Ala29Ala) and c.1673A>G (p.His558Arg) were higher in men than in women for control group (p=0.023 and p=0.027, respectively). For women, patients with IVA had higher allele frequency of c.87G>A than controls (0.455 vs 0.198, p=0.013, odds ratio (OR) 3.382), whereas for men, minor allele c. 1673A>G was significantly less prevalent in IVA patients compared with controls (0.025 vs 0.175, p=0.017, OR 0.121). Significant difference existed in occurrence of ventricular arrhythmia between female patients with 87GA/AA and those with 87GG genotypes (0.348 vs 0.097, p=0.039, OR 4.978) and between male patients with 1673AA and those with 1673AG/GG genotypes (0.311 vs 0.053, p=0.031, OR 8.143). The frequency of haplotype GG (87G-1673G) was significantly lower in IVA patients than in controls (0.016 vs 0.128, p=0.009, OR 0.109). Conclusions: The present study indicates that Chinese Han people have significant difference in distribution of 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (c.87G>A and c.1673A>G) between healthy male and females. The 87A allele might be associated with an increased risk of IVA in females, whereas 1673G allele might have been positively selected because of its protective effects against ventricular arrhythmia in males.",

Methods Based on angiographic features and presence of diabetes mellitus, 374 patients with CAD were divided into group I (focal CAD without diabetes mellitus, n = 107), group II (diffuse CAD without diabetes mellitus, n = 94), group III (diabetes mellitus without CAD, n = 46), group IV (focal CAD with diabetes mellitus, n = 46) and group V (diffuse CAD with diabetes mellitus, n = 81). Serum levels of GA, esRAGE, high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were detected in each group. Results: The serum levels of GA and hsCRP were the highest and esRAGE were the lowest in group V, significantly different from those in the other four groups (P < 0.01). The serum levels of GA and hsCRP were significantly higher and esRAGE were significantly lower in group IV than those in group I, II and III (P < 0.05). GA was positively correlated with hsCRP (r = 0.240) and HbA1c (r = 0.695), and was negatively correlated with esRAGE (r = -0.480) in patients with diabetes mellitus (P < 0.001 for all), while esRAGE was negatively correlated with HbA1c (r = -0.224, P < 0.01) and hsCRP (r = -0.236, P < 0.01). HsCRP was positively correlated with diffuse coronary vessels (r = 0.220, P < 0.001), and hsCRP as well as IL-6 were positively correlated with fasting blood glucose (r = 0.259, P < 0.001; r = 0.124, P < 0.05) in patients with CAD and diabetes mellitus. Conclusion: The increased serum GA and hsCRP levels and decreased serum esRAGE level are important risk factors for diabetes mellitus complicated with CAD, and are vital parameters for diffuse CAD in patients with diabetes mellitus.",

        "abstract": "The selectins play important roles in the inflammatory process of coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI). Previous studies have shown ambiguous findings regarding a possible association between the selectin genes and CAD. The E-selectin Ser128Arg polymorphism and the P-selectin Thr715Pro polymorphism have been investigated widely but with inconsistent results. We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to shed light on this issue.Data were extracted by searches of MEDLINE, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang, Google Scholar, PORTA, GeNii, CiNii, J-STAGE, Nurimedia and Koreanstudies Information Service System [Kiss] up to October 2013, in which 10 studies on the Ser128Arg polymorphism with 3369 cases and 2577 controls and 10 studies on the Thr715Pro polymorphism with 5886 cases and 18345 controls. A random-effects model was used to calculate the combined odds ratios. The between-study heterogeneity and publication bias were addressed.The 128Arg carriers had a significant increased risk of CAD (allele comparison: P\u200a=\u200a0.02, OR\u200a=\u200a1.33, 95%CI 1.04-1.69, P(heterogeneity)\u200a=\u200a0.01); The 715Pro conferred a non-significant risk reduction relative to the 715Thr (allele comparison: P\u200a=\u200a0.40, OR\u200a=\u200a0.94, 95%CI 0.82-1.08, P(heterogeneity)\u200a=\u200a0.03).Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the 128Arg carriers had a significant increased risk of CAD among Asians (allele comparison: P\u200a=\u200a0.001, OR\u200a=\u200a2.07, 95%CI 1.33-3.24, P(heterogeneity)\u200a=\u200a0.77) but not among Caucasians (allele comparison: P\u200a=\u200a0.33, OR\u200a=\u200a1.13, 95%CI 0.88-1.45, P(heterogeneity)\u200a=\u200a0.08). Carrier status for the 715Pro was significantly associated with reduced risk of MI (allele comparison: P\u200a=\u200a0.04, OR\u200a=\u200a 0.81, 95%CI 0.67-0.99, P(heterogeneity\u200a)=\u200a0.14). The asymmetric funnel plot and the Egger's test (P\u200a=\u200a0.041) suggested the presence of publication bias for the Ser128Arg polymorphism.Our results suggested there is an increase in the risk of CAD conferred by the Ser128Arg polymorphism and the thr715Pro polymorphism may be a protective factor of MI.",

        "abstract": "Objective To study the correlation between the microsatellite polymorphism (CCTTT)n repeats in the promoter of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2A) gene(-2.5kb) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in Chinese Han population. Methods Genotyping for the variance was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and automated Genescan analysis in 117 ACS patients and 125 healthy controls. Results The alleles were divided into 2 subclasses, class S including shorter (\u226413) repeats and class L including longer (>13) repeats. The distribution of (CCTTT)n repeats showed statistical difference between ACS group (S/S=48, S/L=64, L/L=5) and controls (S/S=56, S/L=49, L/L=20) ( \u03c72=11.354, P=0.003). In addition, significant differences in (CCTTT)n repeats genotype frequencies were found between female ACS patients and normal controls ( \u03c72=10.39, P=0.006 and \u03c72=8.134, P=0.017,respectively). In this study, the patients with L/L were less likely to have ACS. The odds ratio for homozygote L/L was 0.234 (95%CI=0.085\uff5e0.647,P=0.003). Conclusions Microsatellite polymorphism (CCTTT)n in the promoter of NOS2A gene may be associated with the susceptibility to ACS in Chinese Hans, especially in female populations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Endothelial hyper-permeability is a major determinant factor that contributes to the accelerated development of atherosclerotic lesions at hemodynamically disturbed sites. Previously, we showed that C1q/TNF related protein (CTRP) 1 promotes endothelium-leukocyte interactions and inflammatory responses in vascular cells. Here, we sought to investigate the role of CTRP1 in modulation of endothelial permeability under disturbed flow condition. By using  en face  staining of mouse aorta, we found CTRP1 expression was significantly increased in vascular endothelial cells under disturbed flow as compared to steady laminar flow. Vascular permeability to Evans blue dye was notably enhanced in CTRP1 knockin mice as compared to wild type animals, whereas aortic hyper-permeability at disturbed sites was remarkably restored after deletion of CTRP1. In cultured endothelial cells, treatment of CTRP1 led to increased permeability to fluorescent-labelled dextran and apparent formation of paracellular holes as observed after disturbed flow exposure, which was evidently reduced in the presence of a CTRP1-specific neutralizing antibody. Mechanistically, we found activation of VEGFR2 by CTRP1 might be involved in vascular hyper-permeability under disturbed flow condition. Taken together, this study suggests that CTRP1 is a mechano-sensitive proinflammatory factor that mediates disturbed flow-induced vascular barrier dysfunction. Inhibition of CTRP1 may inhibit the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis at early stage.",

        "abstract": "Background:  Increased transcytosis of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) across the endothelium and oxidative modification of LDL by activated endothelial cells (EC) constitute pivotal early events to initiate atherogenesis. C1q/TNF-related protein (CTRP) 5 is a novel secreted glycoprotein and its biological functions are largely undefined. In this study, we sought to investigate the role of CTRP5 in modulating transcytosis and oxidation of LDL in EC and the underlying mechanisms.   Methods and Results:  Analysis of human coronary endarterectomy specimens and atherosclerotic femoral arteries revealed greater expression of CTRP5 in EC within atherosclerotic lesions as compared to non-atherosclerotic samples. By immunofluorescence analysis, we found CTRP5 led to significantly increased transcytosis and sub-endothelial deposition of DiI-LDL with no permeation to dextran of smaller size after perfusion of mouse aorta. In cultured EC, z-stack analysis by confocal microscopy exhibited accelerated progression of DiI-LDL from the epical membrane downwards over time by CTRP5. Furthermore, CTRP5 treatment led to markedly enhanced passage of biotin-LDL across the endothelial monolayer cultured on transwells as measured by a highly sensitive ELISA. Importantly, pronounced oxidation of the biotin-LDL by CTRP5 after transcytosis was found by detecting the malondialdehyde (MDA)-epitopes with the specific antibody. Mechanistically, we found CTRP5 treatment markedly increased the expression of 12/15-lipoxygenase (LOX), a critical enzyme that catalyzes LDL oxidation in EC. Immunofluorescence studies revealed the nuclear export of 12/15-LOX and partial co-localization with DiI-LDL upon CTRP5 stimulation. Inhibition of 12/15-LOX either by specific-siRNA or the inhibitor Baicalein evidently attenuated CTRP5-elictied oxidation of LDL. Finally, intraperitoneal injection of CTRP5 resulted in enhanced progression of atherosclerosis in ApoE knockout mice fed with high-fat diet, which was markedly reversed after knockdown of 12/15-LOX by lentivirus.   Conclusions:  CTPR5 is a novel pro-atherosclerotic factor by facilitating LDL transcytosis across the endothelial monolayers and oxidation of LDL through promoting 12/15-LOX expression.",

        "abstract": "FTY720, sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist, is a potent immunosuppressive agent. Numerous studies have documented a relationship between S1P and cardioprotection. We therefore hypothesized that a S1P analogue FTY720 would attenuate hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) induced cadiomyocyte apoptosis. H9C2 cardiomyocytes were employed to establish an in vitro model of H/R. Cells were treated or not with different doses of FTY720. Cell viability was measured by flow cytometry and TUNEL staining. Western blot was used to analyze downstream signaling pathway. We observed that FTY720 inhibits the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and activates both AKT and ERK1/2 pathways. AKT pathway can be blocked by MEK kinase inhibitor PD98059. ERK1/2 pathway can be blocked by the phosphoinositide-3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin. AKT and ERK1/2 activation can also be inhibited by S1P1/3 receptor antagonist VPC23019, Gi antagonist PTX. The protein levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL1\u00df were upregulated during hypoxia/reoxygenation and were attenuated by FTY720. We conclude that FTY720, via its cargo of S1P, can protect cardiomyocytes against hypoxia/reoxygenation injury. This effect is achieved by inhibiting caspase-3 expression, inflammatory cytokine levels and activating AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. The prosurvival signal activation is dependent on S1P1, 3 subtype receptors and Gi protein.",

        "abstract": "Background  Renal dysfunction, commonly associated with cardiac dysfunction, has predictive value for adverse long\u2010term outcomes in heart failure (HF). We previously identified a novel renal biomarker, interleukin\u201034 (IL\u201034), elevated in HF patients and associated with kidney dysfunction and coronary artery disease during HF. However, the prognostic value of IL\u201034 in HF remains unclear, so that the present study aimed to determine it.  Methods and Results  This prospective, observational study included 510 consecutive HF patients with their serum IL\u201034 as well as other variables measured at baseline, and they were followed up for 2\u00a0years. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death or a first HF hospitalization, with cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, and all\u2010cause mortality as secondary outcomes. There was a significant and gradual increase in risk as IL\u201034 increased, determined by log\u2010rank tests with Kaplan\u2013Meier curves. Serum IL\u201034 was also a significant prognostic predictor of the primary end point (1.301 [1.115\u20131.518];  P =0.001), cardiovascular death (1.347 [1.096\u20131.655];  P =0.005), HF hospitalization (1.234 [1.018\u20131.494];  P =0.032), and all\u2010cause mortality (1.343 [1.115\u20131.618];  P =0.002) in HF as per SD increase in the log IL\u201034 level after adjusting for age, sex, traditional risk factors, and N\u2010terminal pro\u2010brain natriuretic peptide. Especially, IL\u201034 had a more\u2010significant prognostic value in HF patients with kidney impairment than those without.  Conclusions  IL\u201034 is a significant predictor of cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, and all\u2010cause mortality in chronic HF, especially when concomitant with renal dysfunction. Serum IL\u201034 measurement may provide new insights linking kidney impairment to poor HF outcomes beyond other renal markers.",

        "abstract": "We showed previously that reduced level of vasostatin-2 (VS-2) correlates to the presence and severity of coronary artery disease. In this study, we aimed to figure out the role of chromogranin A (CGA) derived VS-2 in the development of atherosclerosis and monocyte/macrophage recruitment. Apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE) mice fed a high-fat diet exhibited attenuated lesion size by 65\u2009% and 41\u2009% in En face and aortic root Oil red O staining, MOMA-2 positive area by 64\u2009%, respectively, in VS-2 treatment group compared with PBS group. Proinflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) were all remarkably reduced in aortic tissues after VS-2 treatment. Mechanistically, in adhesion assay using intravital microscopy in vivo, VS-2 suppressed the number of leukocytes adhering to the wall of apoE mice mesenteric arteries. In chemotactic assay, flow cytometry analysis of peritoneal lavage exudate from C57BL/6 mice showed VS-2 significantly decreased the recruiment number of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages in a thioglycollate-induced peritonitis model. Furthermore, fewer fluorescent latex beads labelled Ly-6C monocytes accumulated in aortic sinus lesions of apoE mice after VS-2 treatment. In addition, according to the microarray of human monocyte/macrophage, we found VS-2 stimulation caused a dose-dependent decrease of Rac1 expression and inactivation of Pak1 in mice primary monocytes as well as THP-1 cells and inhibited MCP-1/CCL-5 induced transmigration in vitro. In conclusion, the Chromogranin A-derived VS-2 attenuates atherosclerosis in apoE mice and, in addition to its anti-inflammatory property, also acts as an inhibitor in monocyte/macrophage recruitment.",

        "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) incidence among hospitalized patients is increasing steadily. Despite progress in prevention strategies and support measures, AKI remains correlated with high mortality, particularly among ICU patients, and no effective AKI therapy exists. Here, we investigated the function in kidney ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) of C1orf54, a newly identified protein encoded by an open reading frame on chromosome 1. C1orf54 expression was high in kidney and low in heart, liver, spleen, lung and skeletal muscle in healthy mice, and in the kidney, C1orf54 was expressed in tubular epithelial cells (TECs), but not in glomeruli. C1orf54 expression was markedly decreased on Day 1 after kidney IRI and then gradually recovered to baseline levels by Day 7. Notably, relative to wild-type mice, C1orf54-knockout mice exhibited impaired TEC proliferation and delayed recovery after kidney IRI, which led to deteriorated renal function and increased mortality. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated C1orf54 overexpression promoted TEC proliferation and ameliorated kidney pathology, which resulted in accelerated renal repair and improved renal function. Mechanistically, C1orf54 was found to promote TEC proliferation through PI3K/AKT signalling. Thus, C1orf54 holds considerable potential as a therapeutic target in kidney IRI.",

Dectin-1, expressed mainly on activated myeloid cells, is crucial for the regulation of immune homeostasis as a pattern recognition receptor. However, its effects and roles during the myocardial IR injury remain unknown. Methods: Genetic ablation, antibody blockade, or Dectin-1 activation, along with the adoptive bone marrow transfer chimeric model, was used to determine the functional significance of Dectin-1 in myocardial IR injury. Immune cell filtration and inflammation were examined by flow cytometry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. Moreover, Dectin-1+ cells were analyzed by flow cytometry in the blood of patients with ST-segment\u2013elevation myocardial infarction and stable patients with normal coronary artery (control).

        "abstract": "![Figure][1] Objective\u2014 In a previous study, we established diabetic and nondiabetic minipig models with coronary artery in-stent restenosis (ISR). Mass spectrometry showed that high-mobility group box (HMGB) 2 level was higher in ISR than in non-ISR tissue from diabetic minipigs. We here investigated whether serum HMGB2 levels were related to ISR in coronary artery disease patients. The effect of HMGB2 was evaluated in mice with femoral artery wire injury and in human aortic smooth muscle cells.Approach and Results\u2014 From 2513 patients undergoing coronary artery intervention and follow-up angiography at \u22481 year, 262 patients were diagnosed with ISR, and 298 patients with no ISR were randomly included as controls. Serum HMGB2 levels were significantly higher in patients with ISR than in those without ISR and were associated with ISR severity. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that HMGB2 level was independently associated with ISR. In experiments, HMGB2 expression was increased in vascular tissue after injury. Perivascular HMGB2 administration promoted injury-induced neointimal hyperplasia in C57Bl/6 mice compared with in the control, whereas such pathophysiological features were attenuated in Hmgb2 \u2013/\u2013 mice. Mechanistically, HMGB2 enhanced neointimal hyperplasia in mice and proliferation and migration in human aortic smooth muscle cells by inducing reactive oxygen species through increased p47phox phosphorylation. Knocking down p47phox, however, inhibited HMGB2-induced effects in human aortic smooth muscle cells. Finally, HMGB2-induced effects were significantly declined in receptor of advanced glycation end products knockdown or deficient cells, but not in Toll-like receptor 4 knockdown or deficient cells.Conclusions\u2014 Serum HMGB2 levels were associated with ISR in patients. HMGB2 promoted neointimal hyperplasia in mice with arterial wire injury through reactive oxygen species activation.# Highlights {#article-title-36} [1]: pending:yes",

        "abstract": "High-mobility group box (HMGB) family is related to inflammatory diseases. We investigated whether serum HMGB2 levels are related to myocardial infarction (MI) severity and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) during MI. We included 432 consecutive patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and 312 controls. Serum HMGB2 levels were significantly higher in MI patients than in controls. Increased HMGB2 levels were associated with MACE and negatively with ejection fraction in MI patients. HMGB2 was an independent determinant of MACE in logistic regression analysis. HMGB2 protein (10 \u03bcg) or saline was injected intramyocardially in MI rats, with or without coadministration of the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin. After 72 h, pathological, echocardiographic, and hemodynamic examinations showed that HMGB2 increased infarct size and worsened cardiac function in MI rats. Moreover, HMGB2 administration enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cell apoptosis, inflammation, and autophagosome clearance impairment, which were attenuated by coadministration of apocynin or knock down of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). In conclusion, increased serum HMGB2 levels are associated with MI severity and MACE at 1 mo. HMGB2 promotes myocardial ischemic injury in rats and hypoxic H9C2 cell damage via ROS provoked by RAGE. We demonstrate that serum high-mobility group box 2 is associated with major adverse cardiac events at 1 mo in myocardial infarction patients. Mechanistically, high-mobility group box 2 promotes reactive oxygen species production via receptor for advanced glycation end products signaling in ischemic myocardium, thereby aggravating cell apoptosis, inflammation, and autophagosome clearance impairment. This study reveals that high-mobility group box 2 is a novel factor enhancing ischemic injury in myocardial infarction.",

Experiments and model fitting show that there were definite regeneration temperature threshold for fs FBGs written in H 2 -free fiber, H 2 -loaded fiber and UV FBGs in H 2 -loaded fiber. The temperature sensing characteristic of RFBGs were investigated and compared experimentally under ultra-wide temperature range.",

        "abstract": "Although high-density lipoprotein (HDL) can exhibit anti-inflammatory properties, these potent activities can become deficient and even transform into proinflammatory effects under various pathophysiological states. We investigated the effect of diabetic HDL on the inflammatory response in human monocytes and its relation to the existence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). HDL was isolated from DM patients with (n\u00a0= 61) or without (n\u00a0= 31) CAD (diameter stenosis \u226550%) and healthy controls (n\u00a0= 40). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were incubated with HDL and the proinflammatory ability of HDL was determined by tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) secretion in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Secretion of TNF-\u03b1 in human monocytes in response to diabetic HDL was significantly increased compared with that of the control HDL. Of note, HDL from DM patients with CAD stimulated the release of TNF-\u03b1 in monocytes to a greater extent than that of HDL from those without CAD. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the proinflammatory ability of HDL was independently associated with diabetes duration, hemoglobin A1c, serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Furthermore, the proinflammatory ability of HDL was a significant predictor for the presence of CAD in patients with DM.",

        "abstract": " Previous genome-wide association studies revealed that the chromosome 9p21.3 locus is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and diabetes mellitus (DM). However, it is unclear whether the 9p21.3-MI association is direct or mediated by pathways related to DM.  We applied mediation analysis to examine the potential mediating effect of DM on the association between the 9p21.3 genetic risk score (GRS; ranged from 0 to 8) and MI in a case-control study of 865 MI patients and 927 controls without coronary artery disease (CAD). The GRS combining 4 lead 9p21.3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs1333040, rs4987574, rs2383207, and rs1333049) was constructed.  Each 1 unit increase in weighted 9p21.3 GRS was associated with a 9% increased DM risk (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00, 1.19) in the control group and a 14% increased MI risk (95% CI 1.09, 1.20). Mediation analyses yielded a direct-effect odds ratio (OR) of 1.06 (95% CI 1.04, 1.08) and an indirect-effect OR of 1.00 (95% CI 0.99, 1.01) for weighted GRS. DM mediated 4.40% (95% CI 3.42, 6.52) of the total association between the weighted GRS and MI risk. Individuals with the highest quartile of 9p21.3 GRS and DM had a 6-fold higher MI risk than those with the lowest quartile of 9p21.3 GRS and non-DM (OR 6.03, 95% CI 3.48, 10.5).  DM is a weak mediator that explains a small fraction of the 9p21. 3-MI association in Chinese adults. Nevertheless, there is a strong synergistic effect between DM and the 9p21.3 GRS on MI risk.",

        "abstract": "We sought to investigate whether numbers and activity of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) correlate with severity of coronary stenosis as well as cardiovascular risk factors in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Number of circulating EPCs was analyzed in 104 consecutive patients with proven or clinically suspected CAD. Adhesive and migratory activity was also determined. The number of EPCs was lower in patients with a single diseased coronary artery (Group II, n=35, p<0.05 vs. Group I) or multiple diseased arteries (Group III, n=25, p<0.01 vs. Group I, p<0.05 vs. Group II) compared to those with normal coronary arteries (Group I, n=44). The number of EPCs was also related with angiographic Gensini score (r=-0.355, p=0.006). In addition, concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) were elevated in patients with CAD, and positively correlated with Gensini score (r=0.476, p=0.001). As for the risk factors, the number of EPCs was also inversely correlated with age (p=0.001), high sensitivity-CRP (p=0.012), hypertension (p=0.042) and family history of CAD (p=0.043). Most importantly, the migratory capacity of EPCs was compromised in patients with CAD, and inversely correlated with the angiographic Gensini score (r=-0.315, p=0.021). EPCs isolated from patients with CAD also showed an impaired adhesive activity (p<0.05). In conclusion, in patients with stable CAD, reduction in the number and impairment in the function of circulating EPCs were correlated with the severity of coronary stenosis. CRP may play an important role in reducing the number of EPCs and accelerating atherosclerosis. Given the important role of EPCs in neovascularization of ischemic tissue, a decrease in the number and activity of EPCs may contribute to the impaired vascularization in patients with CAD.",

A body of evidence suggests that p\u2010cresyl sulfate (PCS), a uremic toxin, is associated with the cardiovascular mortality rate of patients with chronic kidney disease; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this feature have not yet been fully elucidated. Methods and ResultsWe aimed to determine whether PCS accumulation could adversely affect cardiac dysfunction via direct cytotoxicity to cardiomyocytes. In mice that underwent 5/6 nephrectomy, PCS promoted cardiac apoptosis and affected the ratio of left ventricular transmitral early peak flow velocity to left ventricular transmitral late peak flow velocity (the E/A ratio) observed by echocardiography (n=8 in each group). Apocynin, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase activity, attenuates this alteration of the E/A ratio (n=6 in each group). PCS also exhibited proapoptotic properties in H9c2 cells by upregulating the expression of p22phox and p47phox, NAD...",

        "abstract": "Renal fibrosis is a significant threat to public health globally. Diverse primary aetiologies eventually result in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and immune cells influence this process. The roles of monocytes/macrophages, T cells, and mast cells have been carefully examined, whilst only a few studies have focused on the effect of B cells. We investigated B-cell function in tubulointerstitial fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), using genetic B-cell-deficient \u03bcMT mice or CD20 antibody-mediated B-cell-depleted mice. Obstructed kidneys of \u03bcMT and anti-CD20-treated mice showed lower levels of monocyte/macrophage infiltration and collagen deposition compared to wild-type mice. Mechanistically, anti-CD20 attenuated UUO-induced alterations of renal tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) pro-inflammatory genes, and CC chemokine ligand-2 (CCL2) essential for monocyte recruitment; B cells were one of the main sources of CCL2 in post-UUO kidneys. Neutralization of CCL2 reduced monocyte/macrophage influx and fibrotic changes in obstructed kidneys. Therefore, early-stage accumulation of B cells in the kidney accelerated monocyte/macrophage mobilization and infiltration, aggravating the fibrosis resulting from acutely induced kidney nephropathy. \u00a9 2016 The Authors.

Method: Serum levels of GA,esRAGE concentration were measured in 302 patients with T2DM and 357 patients with T2DM and significant CAD (T2DM and CAD group) . The relation between biochemical measurements and CAD,number of diseased coronary arteries were analyzed. Results: Serum levels of GA(21.28\u00b14.31%),GA/esRAGE ratio (1.21\u00b10.68) were significantly higher in T2DM and CAD group than T2DM group (19.41\u00b13.62% and 0.78\u00b10.46,all P<0.01). Serum esRAGE level was significantly lower in T2DM and CAD group(0.22\u00b10.10ng/ml ) than T2DM group(0.31\u00b10.14ng/ml,P<0.01). Serum esRAGE level was significantly lower in 3-vessel disease than those of 1,2-vessel disease,Serum GA level and GA/esRAGE ratio were significantly higher in 3-vessel disease than those of 1,2-vessel disease (all P<0.01).Serum GA level and GA/esRAGE ratio correlated positively with severity of CAD,and esRAGE values correlated inversely with severity of CAD (all P<0.01).Conclusion: Serum GA and esRAGE levels are associated with presence and severity of CAD in patients with type 2 diabetes. Increased glycation load and impaired protective effect contribute to CAD in patients with type 2 diabetes. GA / esRAGE ratio is a feasible and effective variable for reflecting imbalance of glycation load and protective effect.",

        "abstract": "Background Cyanate has recently gained attention for its role in the pathogenesis of vascular injury. Nonetheless, the effect of cyanate on angiogenesis remains unclear.Methods and Results In this study, we demonstrated that oral administration of cyanate impaired blood perfusion recovery in a mouse hind\u2010limb ischemia model. A reduction in blood perfusion recovery at day 21 was observed in the ischemic tissue of cyanate\u2010treated mice. Likewise, there were fewer capillaries in the ischemic hind\u2010limb tissue of cyanate\u2010exposed mice. Our in\u00a0vitro study showed that cyanate, together with its carbamylated products, inhibited the migration, proliferation, and tube\u2010formation abilities of endothelial cells. Further research revealed that cyanate regulated angiogenesis partly by interrupting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2/phosphatidylinositol 3\u2010kinase/Akt pathway. The serum concentrations of homocitrulline, a marker of cyanate exposure, were determined in 117 patients with stable angina and chronic total occlusion. Consistent with the antiangiogenic role of cyanate, homocitrulline levels were increased in patients with poor coronary collateralization (n=58) compared with those with high collateralization (n=59; 21.09\u00b113.08\u00a0versus 15.54\u00b19.02\u00a0ng/mL, P =0.009). In addition, elevated homocitrulline concentration was a strong predictor of poor coronary collateral growth.Conclusions Impaired angiogenesis induced by cyanate might contribute to poor coronary collateral growth.",

Though the putative motif Psi K XE can be used, optimization of prediction models still remains a challenge. In this study, we developed a prediction system based on feature selection strategy. A total of 1,272 peptides with 14 residues from SUMOsp (Xue et al. [8] Nucleic Acids Res 34:W254-W257, 2006) were investigated in this study, including 212 substrates and 1,060 non-substrates. Among the substrates, only 162 substrates comply to the motif Psi K XE. First, 1,272 substrates were divided into training set and test set. All the substrates were encoded into feature vectors by hundreds of amino acid properties collected by Amino Acid Index Database (AAIndex, http://www.genome.jp/aaindex ). Then, mRMR (minimum redundancy-maximum relevance) method was applied to extract the most informative features. Finally, Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (NNA) was used to produce the prediction models. Tested by Leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation, the optimal prediction model reaches the accuracy of 84.4% for the training set and 76.4% for the test set. Especially, 180 substrates were correctly predicted, which was 18 more than using the motif Psi K XE. The final selected features indicate that amino acid residues with two-residue downstream and one-residue upstream of the sumoylation sites play the most important role in determining the occurrence of sumoylation. Based on the feature selection strategy, our prediction system can not only be used for high throughput prediction of sumoylation sites but also as a tool to investigate the mechanism of sumoylation.",

        "abstract": "The mucin-type O-glycosylation of a protein is an important type of protein post-translational modification. This process is mediated by a\n family of UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases which transfer the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to the serine or threonine residues with unknown specificity. In order to determine the glycosylation\n sites of a given protein, we present a two-staged prediction method here, which first determines whether a protein is a glycoprotein,\n and then determines the glycosylation sites of a protein that has been predicted to be glycosylated in the first stage. In\n the first stage, a protein is encoded by the protein families in PFAM, which is a collective annotated database of classified\n protein families; then it is predicted by a predictor trained by the training set. In the second stage, nonapeptides of the\n predicted mucin-type glycoproteins, with serine or threonine residues at their fifth sites, are represented by indices in\n AAIndex. Then, it is predicted whether the nonapeptides are attached by GalNAc by a predictor, which is constructed with features\n selected by feature selection methods [Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (mRMR) method and Incremental Feature Selection\n method]. The prediction accuracy of the first stage is 94.9% validated by Leave-One-Out validation method; the prediction\n accuracy of the second stage is 99.4%. These results show that this method is valuable to study the mucin-type O-glycosylation. The analysis of the features used to construct the predictor of the second stage confirms the previously obtained\n results from other groups. The residues at position \u22121 and +3 have great impact on the prediction. Among other amino acid\n indices, the indices about alpha and turn propensities and indices about hydrophobicity of the residues in nonapeptide also\n influence the recognition of the GalNAc transferases.

Bradshaw, W.W. Brickey, K.W. Walker, N-terminal processing: the methionine aminopeptidase and N alpha-acetyl transferase families, Trends Biochem. Sci. 23 (1998) 263-267]. The combined action of these two enzymes leads to two types of N-terminal acetylated proteins that are with/without the initiator methionine after the N-terminal acetylation. To accurately predict these two types of N-terminal acetylation, a new method based on feature selection has been developed. 1047 N-terminal acetylated and non-acetylated decapeptides retrieved from Swiss-Prot database (http://cn.expasy.org) are encoded into feature vectors by amino acid properties collected in Amino Acid Index database (http://www.genome.jp/aaindex). The Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy method (mRMR) combining with Incremental Feature Selection (IFS) and Feature Forward Selection (FFS) is then applied to extract informative features. Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (NNA) is used to build prediction models. Tested by Jackknife Cross-Validation, the correct rate of predictors reach 91.34% and 75.49% for each type, which are both better than that of 84.41% and 62.99% acquired by using motif methods [S.

        "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of blood cancer characterized by the rapid growth of immature white blood cells from the bone marrow. Therapy resistance resulting from the persistence of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are found in numerous patients. Comparative transcriptome studies have been previously conducted to analyze differentially expressed genes between LSC and LSC cells. However, these studies mainly focused on a limited number of genes with the most obvious expression differences between the two cell types. We developed a computational approach incorporating several machine learning algorithms, including Monte Carlo feature selection (MCFS), incremental feature selection (IFS), support vector machine (SVM), Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction (RIPPER), to identify gene expression features specific to LSCs. One thousand 0ne hudred fifty-nine features (genes) were first identified, which can be used to build the optimal SVM classifier for distinguishing LSC and LSC cells. Among these 1159 genes, the top 17 genes were identified as LSC-specific biomarkers. In addition, six classification rules were produced by RIPPER algorithm. The subsequent literature review on these features/genes and the classification rules and functional enrichment analyses of the 1159 features/genes confirmed the relevance of extracted genes and rules to the characteristics of LSCs.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge of the polyprotein cleavage sites by HIV protease will refine our understanding of its specificity, and the information thus acquired is useful for designing specific and efficient HIV protease inhibitors. Recently, several works have approached the HIV-1 protease specificity problem by applying a number of classifier creation and combination methods. The pace in searching for the proper inhibitors of HIV protease will be greatly expedited if one can find an accurate, robust, and rapid method for predicting the cleavage sites in proteins by HIV protease. In this article, we selected HIV-1 protease as the subject of the study. 299 oligopeptides were chosen for the training set, while the other 63 oligopeptides were taken as a test set. The peptides are represented by features constructed by AAIndex (Kawashima et al., Nucleic Acids Res 1999, 27, 368; Kawashima and Kanehisa, Nucleic Acids Res 2000, 28, 374). The mRMR method (Maximum Relevance, Minimum Redundancy; Ding and Peng, Proc Second IEEE Comput Syst Bioinformatics Conf 2003, 523; Peng et al., IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell 2005, 27, 1226) combining with incremental feature selection (IFS) and feature forward search (FFS) are applied to find the two important cleavage sites and to select 364 important biochemistry features by jackknife test. Using KNN (K-nearest neighbors) to combine the selected features, the prediction model obtains high accuracy rate of 91.3% for Jackknife cross-validation test and 87.3% for independent-set test. It is expected that our feature selection scheme can be referred to as a useful assistant technique for finding effective inhibitors of HIV protease, especially for the scientists in this field.",

In this paper, we introduce a classifier to predict the small molecule- enzyme interaction, i.e., whether they can interact with each other. Small molecules are represented by their chemical functional groups, and enzymes are represented by their biochemical and physicochemical properties, resulting in a total of 160 features. These features are input into the AdaBoost classifier, which is known to have good generalization ability to predict interaction. As a result, the overall prediction accuracy, tested by tenfold cross-validation and independent sets, is 81.76% and 83.35%, respectively, suggesting that this strategy is effective. In this research, we typically choose interactions between small molecules and enzymes involved in metabolism to ultimately improve further understanding of metabolic pathways.

        "abstract": "Supervised classifiers, such as artificial neural network, partition trees, and support vector machines, are often used for the prediction and analysis of biological data. However, choosing an appropriate classifier is not straightforward because each classifier has its own strengths and weaknesses, and each biological dataset has its own characteristics. By integrating many classifiers together, people can avoid the dilemma of choosing an individual classifier out of many to achieve an optimized classification results (Rahman et al., Multiple Classifier Combination for Character Recognition: Revisiting the Majority Voting System and Its Variation, Springer, Berlin, 2002, 167-178). The classification algorithms come from Weka (Witten and Frank, Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco, 2005) (a collection of software tools for machine learning algorithms). By integrating many predictors (classifiers) together through simple voting, the correct prediction (classification) rates are 65.21% and 65.63% for a basic training dataset and an independent test set, respectively. These results are better than any single machine learning algorithm collected in Weka when exactly the same data are used. Furthermore, we introduce an integration strategy which takes care of both classifier weightings and classifier redundancy. A feature selection strategy, called minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR), is transferred into algorithm selection to deal with classifier redundancy in this research, and the weightings are based on the performance of each classifier. The best classification results are obtained when 11 algorithms are selected by mRMR method, and integrated together through majority votes with weightings. As a result, the prediction correct rates are 68.56% and 69.29% for the basic training dataset and the independent test dataset, respectively.

        "abstract": "Protein's subcellular location, which indicates where a protein resides in a cell, is an important characteristic of protein. Correctly assigning proteins to their subcellular locations would be of great help to the prediction of proteins' function, genome annotation, and drug design. Yet, in spite of great technical advance in the past decades, it is still time-consuming and laborious to experimentally determine protein subcellular locations on a high throughput scale. Hence, four integrated-algorithm methods were developed to fulfill such high throughput prediction in this article. Two data sets taken from the literature (Chou and Elrod, Protein Eng 12:107-118, 1999) were used as training set and test set, which consisted of 2,391 and 2,598 proteins, respectively. Amino acid composition was applied to represent the protein sequences. The jackknife cross-validation was used to test the training set. The final best integrated-algorithm predictor was constructed by integrating 10 algorithms in Weka (a software tool for tackling data mining tasks, http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ ) based on an mRMR (Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance, http://research.janelia.org/peng/proj/mRMR/ ) method. It can achieve correct rate of 77.83 and 80.56% for the training set and test set, respectively, which is better than all of the 60 algorithms collected in Weka. This predicting software is available upon request.",

        "abstract": "We used a machine learning method, the nearest neighbor algorithm (NNA), to learn the relationship between miRNAs and their target proteins, generating a predictor which can then judge whether a new miRNA-target pair is true or not. We acquired 198 positive (true) miRNA-target pairs from Tarbase and the literature, and generated 4,888 negative (false) pairs through random combination. A 0/1 system and the frequencies of single nucleotides and di-nucleotides were used to encode miRNAs into vectors while various physicochemical parameters were used to encode the targets. The NNA was then applied, learning from these data to produce a predictor. We implemented minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) and properties forward selection (PFS) to reduce the redundancy of our encoding system, obtaining 91 most efficient properties. Finally, via the Jackknife cross-validation test, we got a positive accuracy of 69.2% and an overall accuracy of 96.0% with all the 253 properties. Besides, we got a positive accuracy of 83.8% and an overall accuracy of 97.2% with the 91 most efficient properties.

With the advances of techniques in molecular biology, such as RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, efforts have been made to systematically identify synthetic lethal interactions, especially for frequently mutated genes in cancers. However, elucidating the mechanism of synthetic lethality remains a challenge because of the complexity of its influencing conditions. In this study, we proposed a new computational method to identify critical functional features that can accurately predict synthetic lethal interactions. This method incorporates several machine learning algorithms and encodes protein-coding genes by an enrichment system derived from gene ontology terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways to represent their functional features. We built a random forest-based prediction engine by using 2120 selected features and obtained a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.532. We examined the top 15 features and found that most of them have potential roles in synthetic lethality according to previous studies. These results demonstrate the ability of our proposed method to predict synthetic lethal interactions and provide a basis for further characterization of these particular genetic combinations.",

However, erythrocyte agglutination induced by EDTA has not been reported as yet.Spurious low red blood cell (RBC), white blood cell (WBC), and platelet counts were observed in a patient blood sample collected in EDTA in vitro at room temperature and 37 degrees C. However, the phenomena were only observed in the sodium citrate and heparin anticoagulated blood at room temperature, but not at 37 degrees C. Both erythrocyte agglutination and platelet clumping were observed in the peripheral blood smear. These data suggest an EDTA-temperature-induced pseudohematocytopenia.It is a very rare phenomenon to observe erythrocyte agglutination induced by EDTA and temperature.",

An 850 nm GaAs photodetector (PD) array is adopted as the receiver device, and the PD chip is directly wire bonded to a 12-channel high speed IC. The inputs of the PD array are directly coupled into a 12-channel fiber array. We developed a new technology using jointing machine to couple the PD array with fiber array without power supply. The efficiency is 80% and the error of coupling is less than 1 \u03bcm. The total data rate of the receiver module is more than 40 Gbit/s.",

Two fabrication methods-one using only PMMA as mask and one using PMMA and SiO2 as masks are used. The results show that the first method cannot yield an accurate pattern transfer, while the other method can. The extraction efficiency in an LED is enhanced successfully by use of the photonic crystal. The light extraction efficiency of the LED with the photonic crystal structure is twice as high as that of the unprocessed sample under the same testing conditions. Along with the increase of lattice constant, the extraction efficiency also increases.",

Applying public goods theory of economics, it argues that knowledge sharing is a special type of public goods contribution. Accordingly, personal interest prohibits knowledge sharing while personal efficacy promotes knowledge sharing. Further, the functions of interpersonal level factors like teamwork and trust on knowledge sharing are mediated by personal interest and personal efficacy.

Based on a survey of 248 employees and their supervisors from diverse industries in China, the results showed that learning goal orientation was positively associated with innovative performance, with knowledge sharing as a significant mediator. Unexpectedly, job autonomy was not able to mediate the relationship between learning goal orientation and innovative performance. Exploratory analysis showed that the direct effect of performance goal orientation on innovative performance was insignificant, but it had a weak indirect effect on innovative performance through perceived job autonomy.

A multilevel study was conducted in China on the influence of low compensation parity in MNC operations. Findings show that the negative effects of low compensation parity on outcome variables, namely, evaluation of and knowledge sharing with expatriates, as well as job satisfaction and intention to quit, were fully mediated by distributive justice based on a comparison with expatriates. Personal pro-disparity norm regarding low compensation parity played a buffering role and was related to a weaker relationship between compensation parity and comparative distributive justice. Organizational pro-disparity norm showed a similar cross-level buffering effect. Trust climate was related to a weaker relationship between compensation parity and comparative distributive justice, and fully mediated the moderating effect of organizational pro-disparity norm. The findings have important theoretical and managerial implications for mitigating the negative influence of low compensation parity in multinational firms, and point to some important topics for future research on the social integration of locals and expatriates.",

        "abstract": "SummaryThe current research examines the conditions under which cross-cultural teams can realize their creative potential\u2014a consequence of their cultural diversity. We propose that in more culturally diverse teams, team members are less open when communicating with each other, which impairs the teamu0027s ability to elaborate on the information contributed by different members, ultimately limiting team creativity. We further theorize that leadersu0027 benevolent paternalism, a leadership style that is particularly prevalent in East Asian contexts, can reduce the negative consequence of intercultural diversity on intercultural communication openness. On the basis of multiwave, multisource data from 48 culturally diverse teams in China, we found that perceived intercultural diversity is negatively related to intercultural communication openness, which, in turn, is positively related to information elaboration, and ultimately, team creativity. Leader benevolent paternalism attenuates the negative relationship between intercultural diversity and intercultural communication openness. These findings enrich the literature on intercultural diversity by calling attention to communication-related obstacles.",

Of the 210 non-polioviruses strains, a total of 12 strains of adenoviruses were serologically identified. The remaining 198 isolates were used for molecular typing, and the viral genomes of 195 nonpolio enteroviruses (NPEVs) were translated to corresponding amino acid sequences and compared with those of the prototype strains.Based on molecular typing, 5 isolates were classified into 5 serotypes of human enterovirus A species while 158 isolates into 34 serotypes of B and 32 isolates into 6 serotypes of C species. However, we did not isolate any viruses which belonged to human enterovirus D species. Thus, under acute flaccid paralysis surveillance, human enterovirus B species accounted for 75.2% of the 210 isolates and was considered as the predominant one, followed by human enterovirus C (12.2%), adenovirus (5.7%), and human enterovirus A (2.4%).Although the epidemiological characteristics of NPEVs from Yunnan province remained \"unknown\", the molecular typing method had provided us a breakthrough to understand the epidemiology of these viruses.",

METHODS Using a case-control method, this study systematically sampled 240 cases in the selected 4 counties in Yuxi City, which were the vulnerable areas in Yunnan Province. According to 1:1 matching principle, 240 healthy children were identified as the controll group. Questionnaires were used in collecting data. Using EpiData 3.0 to set up batabase and SPSS 17.0 to analyze the collected data. \u03c72 test was used for univariate analysis, and COX model was used for conditional Logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Exposure of children to hand-foot-mouth disease patients was risk factor, while protective factors included non-farmer as the caregiver, washing their hands before meals and breast feeding to infants. CONCLUSION The improvement of people health knowledge, promotion of breastfeeding, formation of a good habit for health and isolation of patients and avoiding contact with hand-foot-and-mouth disease patient can reduce a child\u2019s vulnerability of hand-foot-and-mouth disease.",

Methods With multistage stratified cluster random sampling, 3 600 permanent residents(more than 18years old) were selected for across-sectional study including questionnaire survey, physical examination and laboratory tests.Multiple logistic stepwise regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors related to MS. Results The morbidity and standardized morbidity of MS were 15.8% and 14.8%, respectively. The morbidity and standardized morbidity of MS in males were 17.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those(14.2% and 13.0%) in females(P<0.01). The morbidities of MS in older group(\u2265 60 years old, 21.7%) and middle age group(45-59 years old, 23.0%) were significantly higher than that(11.2%) in young group(18-44 years old)(P<0.01). The morbidity of MS in male middle age group was the highest(23.2%). The morbidity of MS in females increased with age(P<0.01). The morbidity of MS in male young sub-group was 16.0%, which was significantly higher than that(6.8%) in female young sub-group(P<0.01). The morbidity(29.6%) of MS in female older sub-group was obviously higher than that(13.2%) in male older su-bgroup(P<0.01). The order of MS detection rate was: low HDL-C sub-group(34.4%), hypertension sub-group(29.3%), high TG sub-group(28.7%), abnormal glucose sub-group(18.0%) and central obesity sub-group(14.4%). The results of multiple logistic regression showed that the MS risk(OR=2.496,95%CI:1.979~3.150) in middle age and older groups was obviously higher than that(OR=2.351,95%CI:1.688~3.274) in young group, the MS risk in smokers was obviously higher than that in nonsmokers(OR=1.299,95%CI:1.011~1.668), the MS risk in drinkers was obviously higher than that in non-drinkers(OR=1.572,95%CI:1.059~2.334), the MS risk in residents with sedentary behaviour was high(OR=1.953,95%CI:1.185~3.219), the MS risk in residents with hypertension family history and diabetes family history was high(OR=1.584,95%CI:1.232~2.038 and OR=2.157,95%CI:1.322~3.518, respectively), the MS risk in Han residents was higher than that in other nationalities(OR=0.661,95%CI:0.520~0.840).

A total of 1796 miners were enrolled in the study, and a standardized questionnaire was administered probing socio-demographic factors, knowledge of HIV/STDs and sexual behavior. 7 ml-volume venous blood and 15 ml urine specimens were collected for HIV/STDs testing.Twelve participants [0.7%] (12/1760) were identified HIV positive. While, the positive proportions for syphilis, herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2), Neisseria gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachoma were 1.8% (31/1760), 9.6% (169/1760), 0.8% (14/1773), 4.8% (85/1773), respectively. The total prevalence of STDs was 14.9% (264/1776). Factors associated with HIV infection were illegal drug use (adjusted OR = 17.8; 95% CI: 4.0 - 78.8), frequencies of visiting female sex workers in the past twelve months (adjusted OR = 8.7; 95% CI: 1.9 - 39.0), tattoos (adjusted OR = 6.6; 95% CI: 1.8 - 24.0), surgical operation experiences (adjusted OR = 6.0; 95% CI: 1.6 - 22.5) and toothbrush sharing (adjusted OR = 5.6; 95% CI: 1.0 - 31.3). Factors associated with STDs infection were race (adjusted OR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.5 - 2.7), age (adjusted OR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.0 - 2.9), illegal drug use (adjusted OR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.0 - 5.2), living with spouses (adjusted OR = 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1 - 1.9) and visiting female sex workers (adjusted OR = 1.9; 95% CI: 1.4 - 2.6). Only 4.1% (49/1201) of respondents aware the correct transmission routes of HIV. 21.6% (339/1569) of the miners who had previous sexual experience self-reported visiting female sex workers.HIV and other STDs are highly prevalent amongst miners in this region. In addition, the awareness of HIV/STDs is low and multiple routes of HIV transmission, such as heterosexual intercourse and IDU, were also observed in these study subject. HIV/STDs interventions should therefore be reinforced among the miners in this region.",

The complete nucleotide sequences of region VP1 of the 50 strains were all 891nt length coding 297 amino acids. The result of molecular identification of the 50 strains is HEV71. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that 48 EV71 isolates belonged to subgenotype C4a and 2 EV71 isolates belonged to genotype A. From 2009 to 2010, the pathogen of HFMD cases were EV71 strains in Yunnan province, which were co-evolved with isolates from other provinces in mainland of China. There was no significant difference found in the whole sequence of VP1 gene of the strains isolated from different regions or under different diseases occurred, but the spread of genetype A appared in Yunnan Province in 2009.",

        "abstract": "To study the HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) transmission in Kunming city of Yunnan province in 2010.Referring to the guidelines for HIV drug resistance threshold survey (HIVDR-TS) set by WHO, 62 plasma samples of recently reported HIV-infected individuals who were older than 25 years of age, were collected from January to August 2010. Genotyping of pol genetic mutations associated with HIVDR with reverse transcriptional PCR was performed and the prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance transmission was evaluated.Of the 62 plasma samples, 54 were successfully sequenced and genotyped on pol sequence. Based on the pol sequences, HIV subtypes including CRF08_BC (53.2%), CRF07_BC (25.5%), CRF01_AE (19.1%) and C (2.1%) were identified. According to the time of sampling, the first 47 sequenced samples were used for drug resistance prevalence analysis. A protease inhibitor (PI) relative mutation was found in one sample. Based on the WHO standard, the prevalence of transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance was < 5%.HIV-1 drug resistant strains transmission was still catalogued as low prevalence level in Kunming. To prevent the increase of HIVDR prevalence, normative treatment and scientific management to AIDS patients seemed to be quite important.",

        "abstract": "Yunnan has been severely affected by HIV/AIDS in China. Recently, the reported prevalence of HIV-1 among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Yunnan was high in China. To monitor dynamic HIV-1 epidemic among Yunnan MSM, HIV-1 genetic characteristics and transmitted drug resistance (TDR) were investigated.Blood samples from 131 newly HIV-1 diagnosed MSM were continuously collected at fixed sites from January 2010 to December 2012 in Kunming City, Yunnan Province. Partial gag, pol and env genes were sequenced. Phylogenetic, evolutionary and genotypic drug resistance analyses were performed.Multiple genotypes were identified among MSM in Kunming, including CRF01_AE (64.9%), CRF07_BC (25.2%), unique recombinant forms (URFs, 5.3%), subtype B (3.1%) and CRF08_BC (1.5%). CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC were the predominant strains. The mean of genetic distance within CRF01_AE were larger than that within CRF07_BC. The estimated introducing time of CRF01_AE in Yunnan MSM (1996.9) is earlier than that of CRF07_BC (2002.8). In this study, subtype B was first identified in Yunnan MSM. CRF08_BC seems to be the distinctive strain in Yunnan MSM, which was seldom found among MSM outside Yunnan. The proportion of URFs increased, which further contributed to genetic diversity among MSM. Strikingly, genetic relatedness was found among these strains with MSM isolates from multiple provinces, which suggested that a nationwide transmission network may exist. TDR-associated mutations were identified in 4.6% individuals. The multivariate analysis revealed that non-native MSM and divorced/widowed MSM were independently associated with a higher TDR rate.This work revealed diverse HIV-1 genetics, national transmission networks and a baseline level of TDR in MSM. These findings enhance our understanding of the distribution and evolution of HIV-1 in MSM, and are valuable for developing HIV prevention strategies for MSM.",

The stool samples were collected from the healthy children under 15 years old who came from the border areas of Myanmar and Yunnan Province, virus isolation and sequencing were conducted for all the 271 samples. 6 strains of polioviruses (PVs) were detected from 271 stools with an isolation rate of 2.8%, which belonged to vaccine strains and 24 non-polioviruses (NPVs) were detected with an isolation rate of 8.9%. 24 NPVs belonged to human enterovirus group B (HEV-B) with 6 serotypes, HEV-A, HEV-C and HEV-D viruses were not isolated. Among them, 13 NPVs were E7 (54.17%) and 5 NPVs were E13 (20.83%). Our results showed that the enterovirus carrying rate in the border areas of Yunnan province was higher than the rate of routine acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) detection system. The HEV-B viruses were the only enteroviruses isolated. The phylogenetical analysis showed that Echovirus 7(E7) and 13 (E13) exhibited genetic polymorphism.",

        "abstract": "The incidence of heterosexually transmitted HIV infection is rapidly increasing in China, which reached 44.7% among the HIV-positive patients in 2007. With a view to the reduction of HIV transmission and improvement of reproductive health in the Chinese population, this paper introduces the latest evidence obtained from the international epidemiological studies and randomized controlled clinical trials on the preventive effect of male circumcision (MC) on HIV transmission, and elucidates the cellular and molecular mechanisms of HIV transmission through the foreskin. Four studies published during 1997-2007 demonstrated that the mean prevalences of redundant prepuce and phimosis in 15,109 Chinese males aged 3-23 years in 4 areas of China were 43.90 and 11.55% , respectively, while the rate of MC was only 2.66%. As MC is a simple, inexpensive and highly effective technique in HIV prevention, we appeal to the policy-makers in China to conduct a practical program for promoting MC and enhancing male productive health in combination with other approaches to the prevention of HIV infection. MC for neonates, children, adolescents and adults should be included in the health insurance program, and free and timely MC should be performed for the male adults with the high risk of HIV infection and the normal ones whose wives are HIV-positive. Further investigations should be carried out on the epidemiology of redundant prepuce and phimosis, the acceptance and socio-cultural context of MC and the development of simpler and safer methods for MC.",

        "abstract": "Many people from Burma have migrated to Dehong prefecture and married local residents during the past decades; however, little is known about HIV risk-taking behaviours and HIV prevalence among these mixed couples. We investigated factors correlated with HIV discordance and concordance within Chinese?Burmese mixed couples in Dehong prefecture, Yunnan province, China.A cross-sectional study with face-to-face questionnaire interviews and HIV blood testing was conducted.Of 5742 couples, 1.6% couples were HIV-infected concordant, 2.2% were HIV serodiscordant with an HIV-infected male spouse and 0.9% were HIV serodiscordant with an HIV-infected female spouse. HIV discordance with an HIV-infected male spouse was significantly associated with characteristics of the male spouse, including being aged =30 years, non-Han ethnic minority, a marital relationship of <3 years, commercial sex and injection drug use by the male spouse. HIV discordance with an HIV-infected female spouse was significantly associated with an education level of primary school (v. illiterate); a marital status of being in their second marriage, widowed or divorced; a history of sexually transmissible infection diagnosis of the female spouse; noncommercial extramarital sex by the female spouse or by both spouses; and injection drug use by the male spouse. A marital relationship of =3 years was the only significant independent correlate of HIV-infected seroconcordance.The study findings underscore the importance of premarital HIV counselling and testing for this population, and the need for targeted interventions among HIV serodiscordant mixed couples to reduce secondary transmission as early as possible when the relationship begins.",

Newborns of these pregnant women were under PMTCT (prevention of mother to child treatment) program and followed. Every infant was drawn 2 ml venous blood and questionnaire survey was carried out when the baby was 7-12 month-old and completed the vaccination processes. Serum samples of them were then collected and detected on the 5 serological indicators of HBV.were analyzed statistically.There were 2 765 infants in the study program. The success rate of PMTCT was 95.88% . Rates of coverage on both timely-birth dose and 3 doses of HepB were 97.03% and 92.30% respectively. The overall vaccinated rate and timely-birth vaccinated rate on hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) were 68.97% and 94.49% respectively. The success rate of PMTCT was 97.16% after administration of passive-active immune-prophylaxis (HepB and HBIG), compared to the rate as 93.01% when vaccinated with HepB only. Significant differences were seen in the successful rates of PMTCT between combined and non-combined immunization. Either the combined or non-combined immunization, there were significant differences seen in the success rates of PMTCT regardless the positivity status of HBsAg or HBeAg, among the infected mothers.The efficacy of passive-active immune-prophylaxis program seemed to be better than the one without combined immunization. It was vitally important for the infants whose mothers' HBsAg and HBeAg status were positive, to receive regular and timely combined immunization. In order to promote the PMTCT in Yunnan province, vaccinated rate on HBIG should be further improved.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the linkage of HIV transmission from a man to a woman through unprotected sexual contact without disclosing his HIV-positive status.Combined with epidemiological information and serological tests, phylogenetic analysis was used to test the a priori hypothesis of HIV transmission from the man to the woman. Control subjects, infected with HIV through heterosexual intercourse, from the same location were also sampled. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the consensus gag, pol and env sequences obtained from blood samples of the man, the woman and the local control subjects. The env quasispecies of the man, the woman, and two controls were also obtained using single genome amplification and sequencing (SGA/S) to explore the paraphyletic relationship by phylogenetic analysis.Epidemiological information and serological tests indicated that the man was infected with HIV-1 earlier than the woman. Phylogenetic analyses of the consensus sequences showed a monophyletic cluster for the man and woman in all three genomic regions. Furthermore, gag sequences of the man and woman shared a unique recombination pattern from subtype B and C, which was different from those of CRF07_BC or CRF08_BC observed in the local samples. These indicated that the viral sequences from the two subjects display a high level of similarity. Further, viral quasispecies from the man exhibited a paraphyletic relationship with those from the woman in the Bayesian and maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees of the env region, which supported the transmission direction from the man to the woman.In the context of epidemiological and serological evidence, the results of phylogenetic analyses support the transmission from the man to the woman.",

By December of 2003, totally 14 905 cases with HIV infection were reported in 121 counties of 16 prefectures in Yunnan Province. Prevalence of HIV infection ranged from 21.2% to 27.8% in IDUs, over 40% in IDUs from six areas, and 1.23% to 6.67% and 0.3% to 1.8% in underground prostitutes and whoring goers, respectively. Prevalence of HIV infection was 2.1% to 2.7%, 10.8% in specific areas, in male patients with STD, and was 0.14% to 0.25% in pregnant women during 1993 to 2002 and increased to 0.37% in 2003. Prevalence of HIV infection ranged 1.5% to 1.6% in patients with tuberculosis and 0.01% in blood donors during 1999 to 2000 and increased to 0.07% in 2003.Epidemic of HIV infection began in late 1980s in Yunnan, then spread from border areas to inland through IDUs, maintaining a higher prevalence in them to date. Sexual transmission of HIV/AIDS showed an increasing trend in them, with a low prevalence in general population, but appeared a wide spread in local areas.",

Many studies have clearly shown that MC is a simple, safe, and cost-effective method for the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases and urinary tract infection, and for improving genital hygiene. While a 30% MC prevalence exists worldwide, only 5% or less of the Chinese males have undergone circumcision. In this review, we report recent trends in international MC and HIV prevention efforts, as well as the potential benefits and importance of promoting MC in China.

Basic knowledge on HIV and the rate of the response was 93.2%. 81.1% of the respondents had anal sex with male partners in the last six months, of them 49.7% could persistently using condoms in each anal sex episode. 29.0% of the respondents had sex with female partners in the last six months. The HIV prevalence among the studied MSM was 8.2% and the prevalence of syphilis among them was 3.9%. Most risky factors of those MSM infected by HIV would include: not persistently use condom when having sex and co-infection of syphilis.Both rates of HIV infection associated risk behaviors and HIV prevalence were high in MSM under study that called for more work on HIV prevention and control MSM in Yunnan.",

According to time sequence, 300 spouses (600 people) with stable marriage were interviewed with questionnaire.HIV-sero-accordant spouses occupied for 40.7% of the total spouses under survey, with the others were HIV-sero-discordant ones. Among the ones that had already been diagnosed in the families, sexual transmission was their main mode of transmission, which was accounted for 68.3%, followed by IDU as 19.7%. After disclosed the HIV test outcomes to their spouses, 63.4% HIV-sero-discordant spouses and 47.0% HIV-sero-accordant ones changed their sexual behaviors. The rates of consistent condom use among the HIV-sero-discordant spouses increased from 16.8% to 95.0%, and in HIV-sero-accordant spouses increased from 8.2% to 60.9%. Data were analyzed by multi-factor logistic regression. Factors on influencing the sexual transmission in spouses would include condom use, frequency of sexual contacts and sexual transmission disease (STD) status etc.The main transmission mode for the first HIV infected spouse was sexual transmission. Factors influencing sexual transmission in spouses would include condom use, frequency of sexual contacts, STD situation and husband was the first one being infected in the families, etc. Disclosure of the HIV results to the spouses could make a significant changes in the frequencies of sexual contact as well as the rate of condom use.",

Interviewer-administrated questionnaires were carried out. Blood specimens were obtained to test for syphilis and HIV, in which HIV were evaluated by standard HIV enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and HIV nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). Near full-length regions of the HIV-1 were evaluated for subtyping, primary drug resistance mutations.During the follow-up 70.1% of the recruited 378 MSM retained in the cohort. Eleven MSM seroconverted to HIV and fifteen MSM seroconverted to syphilis. The HIV incidence and syphilis incidence was 3.5 (95% CI 1.8-6.2) cases /100 person year(PY) and 5.3 (95% CI 3.0-8.7) cases/100 PY, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that baseline syphilis infection (aHR, 17.7), occupation (students vs. others [aHR, 5.7], retirees vs. others [aHR, 4.1]), bleeding experience after receptive anal intercourse (aHR,7.6), and minority ethnic(vs. Han) [aHR, 5.7] were independent risk factors for HIV seroconversion(each P<0.05). Among the 7/11 successfully amplified near full-length sequences, 71.4% (5/7) were CRF01_AE, and 28.6% (2/7) were CRF07_BC. Two HIV transmission pairs were detected among seroconverted minority ethnic MSM.HIV incidence was moderately high among Yunnan MSM. Yunnan province need to strengthen both HIV and syphilis screening among MSM population. Some subpopulations of MSM, such as students, retirees and minority ethnic groups require more HIV epidemic surveillance and strengthened behavior interventions. HIV subtypes and primary drug resistance should be continually monitored to track cross-group transmission of HIV strains.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the distribution of HIV-1 subtypes in Dehong prefecture, Yunnan province, in 2011.300 HIV-1 positive plasma samples were collected from Jan. 2011 to May 2011 in Dehong prefecture. HIV-1 gag genes and env genes were amplified by nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from viral RNA. After sequencing, the HIV-1 subtypes were determined by phylogenetic analysis.Based on the phylogenetic trees of gag gene and env gene fragments, a total of 222 samples were genotyped. Subtype C was the predominant strain in Dehong (43.2%, 96/222), followed by unique recombinant forms (URFs, 27.0%, 60/222), CRF01_AE (21.2%, 47/222), CRF08_BC (5.0%, 11/222), B' (2.3%, 5/222) and CRF07_BC (1.4%, 3/222). Subtype C strains were predominant in both heterosexually transmitted population and intravenous drug users (IDUs), but different subtype distribution patterns were found in these two populations. All 6 genotypes including subtype C (40.7%, 70/172), CRF01_AE (25.0%, 43/172), and URFs (25.0%, 43/172) found in this area among heterosexually transmitted population, which showed the diversity of genotypes in this population. Except subtype B' and CRF07_BC, the other 3 subtypes and URFs were detected among IDUs, mainly including subtype C (54.8%, 23/42) and URFs (38.1%, 16/42), which showed the concentration trend of genotypes distribution among IDUs. The proportion of URFs increased significantly in this area, including the new BC recombinants (41.7%, 25/60) and CRF01_AE relative URFs (58.3%, 35/60). However, the distributions of these two URFs among heterosexually transmitted population and IDUs showed no statistical significance.The distribution of HIV-1 strains prevailing in Dehong prefecture was diversity, including 5 subtypes and a variety of URFs, of which subtype C was the predominant strain. The distribution patterns of subtype were different among different populations.",

        "abstract": "Yunnan is one of the provinces hardest-hit by HIV in China. To understand HIV epidemic dynamics and evaluate prevention effectiveness, we studied the changing trends in HIV-1 prevalence and incidence among five sub-populations in Yunnan.Consecutive sentinel surveillances were conducted among people who inject drugs (PWID), male sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinic attendees, and pregnant women for 2001-2010,female sex workers (FSWs) for 2007-2010, men who have sex with men (MSM) for 2008-2010. For the newly diagnosed HIV-seropositive samples, the recent infections were determined with BED-capture enzyme immunoassay (BED-CEIA), based on which HIV incidence was calculated for each sub-population using McDougal algorithm.From 231,117 individuals, 6,107 HIV-positive samples were tested with BED-CEIA, among which 964 samples were identified as recent infections. In PWID, HIV prevalence for 2001-2010 was between 27.16% and 18.35%, while the estimated incidence rate significantly decreased from 11.68% in 2001 to 1.70% in 2010. Among male STD clinic attendees, both the HIV prevalence (from 3.62% in 2001 to 1.73% in 2010) and incidence (from 1.10% in 2001 to 0.40% in 2010) showed a significant decreasing trend. In FSWs, the HIV prevalence for 2007-2010 kept stable (between 2.46% and 1.95%), while the HIV incidence significantly decreased (from 0.71% in 2007 to 0.31% in 2010). In MSM, the HIV prevalence (between 11.78% and 9.42%) and incidence (between 6.01% and 8.38%) remained stable at a relatively high level for 2008-2010. In pregnant women, the HIV prevalence (between 0.44% and 0.30%) and incidence (between 0.15% and 0.08%) remained stable for 2001-2010.The HIV incidences in PWID, male STD clinic attendees and FSWs showed the decreasing trend, supporting a positive effect of prevention strategies for these sub-populations. MSM with the highest HIV incidence have become the sub-population most at risk. In most sub-populations, the HIV prevalence did not decline, suggesting the disease burden is still heavy. These findings are valuable for developing HIV prevention strategies in Yunnan.",

The signs of the morphine withdrawal syndromes and the formation of morphine-conditioned place preference were suppressed by pretreatment with L365,260 (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) and not affected by pretreatment with MK-329 (0.1 and 1 mg/kg). The present study demonstrated CCK, acting on CCK-B receptors, participates in the development of the opiate dependence.

After 3 days of consecutive morphine injections, the \u03b1-CaMK II mRNA levels exhibited a trend of up-regulation, and after 6 days of consecutive morphine injections it increased over 50-60% as compared with the control group. The \u03b1-CaMK II mRNA levels remained high 24 h after the cessation of chronic morphine treatment and returned to the control level 72 h later. However, changes of \u03b1-CaMK II gene levels mentioned above were not detected in amygdala or piriform cortex. Taken together, our data demonstrate that chronic morphine treatment region-specific up-regulates the levels of the \u03b1-CaMK II gene expression in hippocampus and frontal cortex. \u00a9 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

        "abstract": "The possible effects on the morphine withdrawal signs of the nonspecific corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor antagonist alpha-helical CRF, the selective CRF receptor subtype 1 antagonist CP-154,526 and the selective CRF receptor subtype 2 antagonist antisauvagine-30 (AS-30) were investigated in rats. The most withdrawal signs, including jumping, teeth chatter, writhing, shakes, lacrimation, piloerection, irritability and diarrhoea, were attenuated by pretreatment with alpha-helical CRF (10 microg i.c.v.) and CP-154,526 (30 mg/kg i.p.). However, no morphine withdrawal signs except for diarrhea were significantly affected by pretreatment with AS-30 (10 microg, i.c.v.). To investigate the possible role of different CRFR antagonists (alpha-helical CRF, CP-154,526 and AS-30) in relapse to opiate dependence, the 28-day extinction of morphine-conditioned place preference (CPP) was used. The morphine-CPP disappeared following a 28-day extinction and then was reactivated by a single injection of 10 mg/kg morphine. Pretreatment with alpha-helical CRF (10 microg, i.c.v.) and CP-154, 526 (30 mg/kg, i.p.) could significantly block this reactivation of morphine-CPP. In contrast, pretreatment with AS-30 (1 or 10 microg i. c.v.) did not affect this reactivation of morphine-CPP. The present study demonstrated that activation of the CRF receptor is involved in morphine withdrawal signs and relapse to morphine dependence, and that the role of CRF receptor subtypes 1 and 2 in withdrawal and reactivation of morphine dependence is not identical. CRF receptor subtype 1, but not subtype 2, is largely responsible for the action of the CRF system on opiate dependence. These results suggest that the CRF receptor antagonists, particularly the CRF receptor subtype 1 antagonist, might be of some value in the treatment and prevention of drug dependence.",

        "abstract": "Relapse is a major characteristic of drug addiction and the primary problem in treating drug abuse. Based on the negative reinforcement view of addiction, in which the motivation to take drugs is thought to result from the desire to avoid the aversive effect of drug withdrawal, it has been theorized that withdrawal symptoms play a major role in the maintenance of and relapse to drug taking. However, the role of withdrawal in relapse has not yet been systemically investigated in the reinstatement model.Using a conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm, we examined the role of different morphine withdrawal states (spontaneous withdrawal, naloxone-precipitated withdrawal, and conditioned withdrawal) in relapse to drug seeking.Rats alternately received morphine (10 mg/kg, s.c.) and saline for 8 days to acquire the CPP. The morphine CPP disappeared after a 2-week extinction phase of saline-paired training. Rats were then chronically administered morphine to induce physical dependence. The different withdrawal states were induced and their roles in the reinstatement of extinguished CPP were assessed. During conditioned withdrawal, trunk blood samples were taken and the corticosterone level was measured by radioimmunoassay. To examine the role of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor antagonist on conditioned-withdrawal-induced reinstatement of CPP, different doses of alpha-helical CRF (0.1 and 1 mug, i.c.v.) were administered 30 min prior to the CPP testing.The results show that morphine spontaneous withdrawal and naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal were ineffective in reinstatement morphine CPP. However, the withdrawal cues significantly elicited the reinstatement of CPP and increased corticosterone level. Moreover, pretreatment with the CRF receptor antagonist alpha-helical CRF (1 mug, i.c.v.) significantly attenuated the effects of withdrawal cues on reinstatement of CPP and corticosterone levels.These findings demonstrate that the cues associated with previous drug withdrawal play a major role in drug relapse and that activation of the CRF receptor is involved in conditioned-withdrawal-induced reinstatement. The present study suggests that CRF receptor antagonists might be of value in the treatment and prevention of relapse to drug seeking after long-term abstinence.",

The present study was designed to investigate the effects of social environments on learning and memory, neurogenesis, and neuroplasticity. Twenty-two-day-old rats were housed in isolation or in groups for 4 or 8 weeks and injected intraperitoneally with bromodeoxyuridine to detect proliferation among progenitor cells. The animals were also tested for learning in a water maze and for hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation in vivo and in vitro. The results show that the number of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus and the learning in a water maze decreased significantly in rats reared in isolation for 4 or 8 weeks, as compared with grouped controls. Induction of long-term potentiation in the CA1 area of rat hippocampus in vivo and in vitro was also significantly reduced by isolation. Furthermore, the effects of isolation rearing on spatial learning, hippocampal neurogenesis, and long-term potentiation could be reversed by subsequent group rearing. These findings demonstrated that social environments can modify neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in adult hippocampal regions, which is associated with alterations in spatial learning and memory.",

The results showed: 1. there was no significant difference for the adrenalectomized rats' spending time between the morphine and saline-paired side during the test session (t = 1.84, P > 0.05), but obvious differences of time spent between the morphine and saline-paired side were observed among the other three groups (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01); 2. the time spent in the morphine-paired side of the adrenalectomized group significantly decreased, compared with those of the other three groups, and there was no difference for the time spent in the morphine-paired side among the groups of adrenalectomy + hydrocortisone 20 mg/kg S.C., adrenalectomy + hydrocortisone 40 mg/kg S.C., and saline S.C..

        "abstract": "The effects of different concentrations of cadmium(Cd),lead(Pb) and their combination on the uptake and transportation of Cd and Pb in plants were studied by means of water culture.The results showed that Pb and Cd mainly enriched in the baby bokchoi roots;the content of Cd and Pb in baby bokchoi had significant positive correlation with exogenous Cd and Pb concentrations(p<0.01).In the combined Pb-Cd treatment,the BCFCd of aerial part of baby bockchoi increased with the concentration of Pb in water culture,while BCFCd of root was the opposite,namely BCFCd of roots of baby bockchoi decreased with the concentration of Pb increased in water culture,indicated that exogenous Pb concentration can promote the enrichment of Cd in the leaves,but inhibited the enrichment of Cd in the roots;the BCFPb of aerial part of baby bockchoi decreased with the concentration of Cd in water culture,while BCFPb of roots was the opposite,namely BCFPb of roots of baby bockchoi increased with the concentration of Cd increasing in water culture,indicated that exogenous Cd concentration can promote the enrichment of Pb in the roots,but inhibited the enrichment of Pb in the leaves;Cd has a dual role in the Pb enrichment in baby bockchoi.The high concentration of Pb(\u2265500 mg/L) could promote the transfer of Cd from the root system of baby bockchoi to the aerial part,while Cd could inhibit the transfer of Pb from the the root system of baby bockchoi to the aerial part,which could keep more Pb in the roots of baby bockchoi.",

        "abstract": "The epidemiological characteristics of congenital heart disease (CHD) in children aged from 4 to 18 years were investigated in Qinghai province.Altogether 288 066 children inhabiting at 6 prefectures and 3 counties were examined by the following three steps: pre-screening, re-examination and diagnosis with color Doppler. And the entity distribution was analyzed while the differences were compared by age, gender, altitudes and nationalities respectively.Altogether 1633 cases of CHD were discovered. The total prevalence of CHD was 5.71 per thousand. The prevalence of CHD was found to increase with the increase of altitude by 4.89 per thousand at the altitude of 2535 m, 5.71 per thousand at 3600 m, and 8.74 per thousand at 4200 m respectively. There were significant differences among different altitude (chi(2) = 54.696, P < 0.001). chi(2) trend analysis showed the increase with chi(2) = 41.826(P < 0.001). The total incidence of CHD in females was 6.95 per thousand, which was significantly higher than that in males with 4.54 per thousand (chi(2) = 73.79, P < 0.001). There were significant differences between males and females at the altitude of 3000 m (chi(2) = 84.733, P < 0.001) and 4000 m (chi(2) = 16.313, P < 0.001) except at the altitude of 2000 m (chi(2) = 0.807, P > 0.05). The prevalence of CHD in different age groups was statistically significant at the every altitude of 2000 m (chi(2) = 18.138, P < 0.001), 3000 m (chi(2) = 18.544, P < 0.001) and 4000 m (chi(2) = 27.535 P < 0.001). The prevalence of CHD was increasing with the increase of age groups at the altitude of 3000 m (chi(2) = 19.230, P < 0.001) and 4000 m (chi(2) = 26.894, P < 0.001) except at the altitude of 2000 m. Within the prevalence of CHD of different nationalities, there was a significant difference with chi(2) = 24.456 (P < 0.001). Within the constituent rate of CHD, the prevalence of atrial septal defect (ASD) was as high as 37.42%, followed by the prevalence of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) as 28.47% and ventricular septal defect (VSD) as 26.01%. Regarding the four categories of CHD, the constituent rate varied at different altitudes. For example, the prevalence rate of ASD constituted 37% at the altitude of 2000 m and 3000 m, and that of PDA accounted for 46.36% at the altitude of 4200 m.The epidemiological characteristics of CHD in Qinghai children were possibly associated with altitude levels.",

The risk factors of developing PAH in these ASD patients were defect size (OR: 1.200, 95%CI: 1.156 - 1.246, P = 0.000), age (OR: 1.027, 95%CI: 1.003 - 1.052, P = 0.025) and altitude (OR: 1.389, 95%CI: 1.001 - 1.637, P = 0.043) while gender and nationality were not risk factors for PAH. The incidence of developing PAH increased with aging (P = 0.000). The standardized ratio of PAH at \u2265 3500 m was 74.8% which was significantly higher than that at 2000 - 2499 m altitude (66.2%, P = 0.005) and at 2500 - 3499 m altitude (66.9%, P = 0.005).The risk for developing PAH is high in patients living at high altitude area. The risk factors of developing PAH in ASD patients living at high altitude are defect size, age and altitude.",

Eighteen among 31 (58.1%) HPV-16 infected patients with cervical cancer were found to have integrated infection of HPV-16. The positive rates of HPV-16 infection in the patients with CIN I, CIN II and CIN III were 19.2%, 34.8% and 42.4%, and the integrated infection rates of HPV-16 were 16.7%, 18.8% and 35.7%, respectively. Compared with patients with different grades of CIN, the integrated rate of HPV-16 infection in those with cervical cancer was significantly elevated.Among the patients with HPV-16 infection, the integrated state of HPV-16 is positively correlated with the severity of cervical lesions. Combined HPV typing test and detection of integrated viral state contribute to predicting the prognosis of patients with cervical precancerous lesions and increasing the accuracy of screening cervical cancer on the basis of HPV DNA detection.",

Compared with the treatment with agents alone, combined treatment of the cells significantly improved the cytotoxicity of the chemotherapeutic agents (P<0.05) and increased the ROS level and the apoptosis of the cells.Bortizomib can inhibit the protein kinase to induce the apoptosis and enhance the chemosensitivity of Ishikawa cells.",

Removed CLs lengths were measured. Biopsies were collected from the proximal, middle and distal segment of CLs and fixed. Different markers were used for immunohistochemisty analysis: tyrosine hydroxylase for sympathetic nerves; vasoactive intestinal polypeptide for parasympathetic nerves; CD34 for blood vessels; and D2-40 for lymphatic vessels. The volume density (Vv), a parameter of biological stereology, was used to quantitatively measure CL components, while post-operative functions, such as defecation, micturition and two-year disease free survival in RH and NSRH groups were compared.The nerves mainly existed in the middle and distal segments of CLs. The Vv was greater in RH compared with NSRH for both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve markers (P<0.05), while the Vv of blood and lymphatic vessels were same in the two groups. Average time to achieve residual urine\u226450ml and first defecation were shorter in NSRH than in RH (P<0.05).Less autonomic nerves within CL are transected in NSRH than in RH, while blood/lymphatic vessels are efficiently removed in both treatments. Compared to RH, NSRH decreases iatrogenic injury, which leads to reduced post-operative co-morbidities, with ensure the same radicality.",

Methods: The data of 440 patients undergoing treatment of acute myocardial infarction with domestic drug eluting stents (n = 318, domestic stent group) or imported drug eluting stents (n = 111, imported stent group) in two hospitals of Shanghai were obtained by chart review and telephone follow-up from January 2007 to June 2009. Comparison and analysis were conducted in two groups with effect, safety and economic parameters as dependent variables and the other related factors of patients as independent variables. Results: There was no significant difference in mortality during hospitalization, mortality in one year of follow-up, percent of recurrence of myocardiopathy and percent of a second conventional coronary angiography (CAG) or a second percutaneous coronary intervention between two groups (P > 0.05). The cost of drug eluting stents per person and cost of each drug eluting stent in imported stent group were significantly higher than those of domestic stent group (P < 0.001). Patients with medical insurance paid much less for drug eluting stents per person than those without medical insurance (P < 0.05). No matter with medical insurance or not, patients in imported stent group paid much more for drug eluting stents per person than those in domestic stent group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Domestic drug eluting stents have better cost-effective properties than imported drug eluting stents in treatment of acute myocardial infarction. Higher payment ratio should be implemented on imported drug eluting stents for a more widely use of domestic drug eluting stents.",

Methods: Two hundred inpatients were selected from one pilot hospital of reform (with global budget and diagnosis related groups payment reform) and non-pilot hospital (without payment reform) respectively, and the satisfaction of inpatients with reform measures was surveyed with questionnaires. Results: There was no significant difference in demographic characteristics between two hospitals (P > 0.05). The total score of satisfaction of pilot hospital (4.64 \u00b1 0.24) was significantly higher than that of non-pilot hospital (4.40 \u00b1 0.28)(P < 0.01). Among 5 first-level indicators, the scores of hospital environment, health service providing and medical auxiliary service in polit hospital were significantly higher than those in non-pilot hospital (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the satisfaction rate between pilot hospital (93.18%) and non-pilot hospital (90.98%)(P > 0.05). The satisfaction rate of health service providing was the lowest among 5 indicators in these two hospitals, and were 84.00% and 79.58% respectively (P > 0.05). The satisfaction rate of medical auxiliary service in pilot hospital (97.04%) was significantly higher than that in non-pilot hospital (87.83%) (P < 0.01). Among 20 second-level indicators, except for the indicators of waiting time for admission, admission procedures, explanation of admission reason by doctor, attitude of medical technician and doctor's response to the demand of patients, the scores of satisfaction of the other 15 indicators in pilot hospital were significantly higher than those in non-pilot hospital (P < 0.01). Moreover, inpatients were most satisfied with the service attitude of nurses, and were most dissatisfied with the health care cost. Convenience of bill query, satisfaction of hospital environment and food quality of hospital were second-level indicators that significantly correlated with the total satisfaction score of inpatients. Conclusion: The satisfaction of inpatients in pilot hospital is relatively higher. Further efforts should be made to push forward global budget and diagnosis related groups payment reform in Beijing in order to control the medical expenditure and improve the satisfaction of inpatients.",

Methods: Questionnaires survey of satisfaction was conducted in 400 outpatients randomly selected from two pilot hospitals of public hospital reform in Beijing, and the data were statistically analysed. Results: The general satisfaction of outpatients in these two hospitals was relatively higher, and the total scores were 4.33 and 3.97 respectively. The outpatients were more satisfied with the hospital environment, service attitude and service delivery, and were less satisfied with the medical cost. The correlation analysis revealed that medical cost, service attitude and technical level had higher levels of correlation with the overall satisfaction. Conclusion: In the next step of public hospital reform in Beijing, more attention should be paid in relief of burden of outpatients, including reducing the waiting time and medical cost through reform of appointment service and payment mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the working status of medical staff with the public hospital reform in Beijing, and evaluate the effect of reform on behaviors, recognition and attitudes of medical staff. Methods: The research scheme and scale designed by the third party was employed to conduct an anonymous questionnaire survey among 400 medical staff of two tertiary comprehensive hospitals in Beijing (one pilot hospital of public hospital reform and one non-pilot hospital), and analyse the differences in workload, income and satisfaction among different hospitals and medical staff on different posts. A total of 382 valid questionnaires were recovered, data input was conducted with EpiData3.0, and statistical analysis was carried out with SPSS 17.0 software Results: The medical staff worked 9 h per day, and 73.3% considered the current workload was high in the pilot hospital, while the medical staff worked 7.5 h per day, and 65.0% considered the current workload was high in the non-pilot hospital. The average monthly income of the pilot hospital was 9386.0 yuan, which was significantly higher than that of the non-pilot hospital (5956.2 yuan) (P < 0.05). Almost half of the medical staff in two hospitals thought the respect from patients was moderate. The overall working satisfaction was not high, and the medical staff (especially nurses) in the pilot hospital was more satisfied with the performance assessment system. Conclusion: The advance of health system reform increases workload of medical staff, and most of the medical staff are overworked. The income of medical staff increases to some extent over the previous year, but still does not meet the expectation. The dynamic management of nursing post in the pilot hospital gets the approval from nurses, and can be implemented to the other posts.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the feasibility of the questionnaire on tobacco control among adolescents in Shanghai by evaluation of its validity and reliability. Methods: Questionnaire survey on tobacco control among adolescents was conducted in 19 117 junior middle school students and senior high school students selected from 41 schools in 3 districts of Shanghai by cluster random sampling. The questionnaire included basic information of individuals, families and schools, condition of tobacco use, awareness of smoking hazard, inherent tendency of tobacco use, tobacco control educational environment of schools, external appeal of tobacco use, second-hand smoke exposure, tobacco exposure in families, tobacco use of peers and risk of media exposure to tobacco use. Validity and internal reliability were evaluated by statistical software. And the test-retest reliability was evaluated by the data of 287 students selected from 6 of these schools. Results: Most Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranged from 0.504 to 0.804, and the tobacco exposure in families and tobacco use tendency in the future were the two scales with highest internal reliability. All the Spearman correlation coefficients were larger than 0.7, which reflected the favorable test-retest reliability. Ten factors explained 61.17% of the questionnaire structure found by factor analysis, and all factors could be regarded as predisposing factors, reinforcing factors and enabling factors. Conclusion: The questionnaire can be applied among adolescents in Shanghai to assess tobacco control programs with good reliability and validity.",

Methods: Female nursing workers from 29 hospitals of 12 districts in Shanghai were selected by random sampling, and were investigated with questionnaires which were involved with basic personal information, working time, average monthly income, pre-post training, labor security and social support. Results: It was found that 82.11% of migrant female nursing workers in Shanghai and 24.32% of local female nursing workers did not have overtime wages (P < 0.05), 25.23% of local female nursing workers and 89.78% of migrant female nursing workers did not sign labor contracts (P < 0.05), and 46.74% of local female nursing workers were trained for at least half a year, while 95.92% of migrant female nursing workers were trained for less than 3 months. Besides, support attitude from family members had influence on self-assessment of female nursing workers (r = 0.288, P < 0.05). Conclusion: There exist significant differences in basic condition, working time, average monthly income, pre-post training, labor security and social support demand between local and migrant female nursing workers in Shanghai. Household registration discrimination should be abandoned, and social support network system should be established for social support demand of migrant female nursing workers.",

An analytical method based on hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC)/tandem mass spectrometry was developed and validated for the determination of metformin in dietary supplements and herbal medicines. Sample preparation involved solid phase extraction of the analyte using Plexa PCX cartridges, and cleanup by a primary-secondary amine (PSA) adsorbent for minimization of the matrix effect. Chromatographic separation was performed on a HILIC column using a mixture of 0.025 mol/L ammonium formate (pH 3) and acetonitrile (18:82, v/v) as the mobile phase at flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. The method was validated in four matrices (capsules, honeyed pills, tablets and oral solutions). The method had a good linear range (5-500 ng/mL), and the overall precision and accuracy ranged from 2.2% to 9.9% and 4.6% to 11.3%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Objective To understand the situation of chemical contamination of foods in Guangdong Province.Method Different kinds of food samples were collected from each monitoring spots in Guangdong in summer and fall since 2000. More than 80 items were examined for pesticide residues, metal contaminants, food additives and fungus toxin.Results A total of 43976 test data had been gained during the 6 years. The rates of qualified samples which met the national hygienic standard of lead and cadmium in foods were 91.6% and 89.6% respectively. The lead levels in samples of preserved eggs and vegetables and cadmium levels in samples of squilla dry germ, pig kidney and rice were proved having lower rates of qualification. In samples of vegetable and fruit, the detection rate of organophosphorous pesticide residues was 10.0% and 8.6% of the samples exceeded the tolerance limit both lower than those recorded 10 years ago. The detection rate of cypermethrin residues in various kinds of vegetables ranged 21.7%\uff5e31.8%, indicating that the use of pyrethrins was more widespread in recent years. Sweet flavor and antiseptic additives in some processed foods exceeded the standard limit seriously. Sodium cyclamate in 44.4% of preserved fruits, such as salted orange peel and hua-mei, exceeded the standard limit. High rates of saccharin, sodium cyclamate, sorbic acid and benzoic acid in samples of pickled vegetables were going beyond the standsrd limit. Illegally adding tartrazine, sunset yellow and poncea in cooked meat products was a popular practice. High content of chloropropanol was found in part of bulk sauce.Conclusion Close attention should be paid to the problem of chemical contamination of the processed food sold in the township bazaars of Guangdong.",

        "abstract": "A sorbent was synthesized and investigated for molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE). Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) were synthesized via precipitation polymerization procedure, where methacrylic acid (MAA) was used as functional monomer and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EDMA) as cross-linking agent. The imprinting effect and selectivity of the MISPE were evaluated by elution experiments. The resulting MISPE showed high extraction selectivity to malachite green, gentian violet and their metabolites, which may be caused by both the ion exchange and the hydrophobic interactions. The determination of multi-residue for malachite green, gentian violet and their metabolites in aquatic products by HPLC coupled with MISPE was also investigated. The mean recoveries calculated by solvent calibration curve for malachite green (MG), gentian violet (GV), leucomalachite green (LMG) and leucogentian violet (LGV) were from 89.8% to 99.1% for grass carp, 90.6% to 101.2% for shrimp and 91.3% to 96.3% for shellfish. The decision limit (CCalpha) and the detection capability (CCbeta) obtained for MG, GV, LMG and LGV were in the range of 0.11-0.14 and 0.19-0.24 microg kg(-1) for grass carp, shrimp and shellfish. The MISPE was successfully used off-line for the determination of MG, GV and their metabolites in aquatic products.",

        "abstract": "Humans and laboratory animals remain highly vulnerable to relapse to cocaine-seeking after prolonged periods of withdrawal from the drug. It has been hypothesized that this persistent cocaine relapse vulnerability involves drug-induced alterations in glutamatergic synapses within the mesolimbic dopamine reward system. Previous studies have shown that cocaine self-administration induces long-lasting neuroadaptations in glutamate neurons of the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens. Here, we determined the effect of cocaine self-administration and subsequent withdrawal on glutamate receptor expression in the amygdala, a component of the mesolimbic dopamine system that is involved in cocaine seeking and craving induced by drug-associated cues. Rats were trained for 10 days to self-administer intravenous cocaine (6 h/day) or saline (a control condition) and were killed after one or 30 withdrawal days. Basolateral and central amygdala tissues were assayed for protein expression of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunits (GluR1 and GluR2) and the NMDA receptor subunits (NR1, NR2A and NR2B). In the basolateral amygdala, GluR1 but not GluR2 levels were increased on days 1 and 30, NR2A levels were increased on day 1, and NR2B levels were decreased on day 30 of withdrawal from cocaine. In the central amygdala, GluR2 but not GluR1 levels were increased on days 1 and 30, NR1 levels were increased on day 30 and NR2A or NR2B levels were not altered after withdrawal from cocaine. These results indicate that cocaine self-administration and subsequent withdrawal induces long-lasting and differential neuroadaptations in basolateral and central amygdala glutamate receptors.",

Cocaine seeking induced by re-exposure to cocaine cues or cocaine itself, as measured in extinction or drug-induced reinstatement tests, respectively, was then assessed 1 day, or 1, 3 or 6 months after withdrawal. Rats were first given six 1-h extinction sessions wherein lever presses resulted in contingent presentations of cues previously paired with cocaine infusions. Subsequently, reinstatement of drug seeking induced by cocaine injections (expt 1: 0, 5, and 15 mg/kg, i.p.; expt 2: 0, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg) was assessed during three 1-h sessions.Profound time dependent changes in responsiveness to cocaine cues in the extinction tests were observed, with low responding after 1 day, high responding after 1 and 3 months, and intermediate responding after 6 months of withdrawal. In contrast, no significant time dependent changes in cocaine-induced drug seeking were found; acute re-exposure to cocaine effectively reinstated responding at all withdrawal periods.Results indicate that the withdrawal period is a critical modulator of drug seeking provoked by re-exposure to cocaine cues, but not cocaine itself. Results also indicate that while the incubation of responsiveness to cocaine cues is a long lasting phenomenon, it is not permanent.",

        "abstract": "Using a rat model of drug craving, we found that the responsiveness to cocaine cues progressively increases or incubates over the first 60 d of cocaine withdrawal. Here we studied whether alterations in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels within the mesolimbic dopamine system are associated with this incubation phenomenon. BDNF is involved in synaptic plasticity and was found to enhance responding for cues associated with natural rewards. Rats were trained to press a lever to receive intravenous cocaine or oral sucrose for 6 hr/d for 10 d; each earned reward was paired with a tone-light cue. Resumption of lever-pressing behavior was then assessed on days 1, 30, or 90 of reward withdrawal. First, resistance to extinction was assessed during 6 hr in which lever presses were not reinforced and the cue was absent. Second, cue-induced reinstatement was assessed after extinction during 1 hr in which responding led to cue presentations. Other rats were killed without testing on days 1, 30, and 90 of reward withdrawal, and BDNF and nerve growth factor (NGF) protein levels were measured in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), accumbens, and amygdala. Lever pressing during extinction and cue-induced reinstatement tests of cocaine craving progressively increased after cocaine withdrawal. Time-dependent changes also were observed during the tests for sucrose craving, with maximal responding on day 30. BDNF, but not NGF, levels in the VTA, accumbens, and amygdala progressively increased after cocaine, but not sucrose, withdrawal. Time-dependent increases in BDNF levels may lead to synaptic modifications that underlie enhanced responsiveness to cocaine cues after prolonged withdrawal periods.",

        "abstract": "The reinstatement model is currently used in many laboratories to investigate mechanisms underlying relapse to drug seeking. Here, we review briefly the history of the model and describe the different procedures that have been used to study the phenomenon of reinstatement of drug seeking. The results from studies using pharmacological and neuroanatomical techniques to determine the neuronal events that mediate reinstatement of heroin, cocaine and alcohol seeking by acute priming injections of drugs, drug-associated cues and environmental stressors are summarized. In addition, several issues are discussed, including (1) the concordance between the neuronal mechanisms involved in drug-induced reinstatement and those involved in drug reward and discrimination, (2) the role of drug withdrawal states and periods in reinstatement of drug seeking, (3) the role of neuronal adaptations induced by exposure to drugs in relapse, and (4) the degree to which the rat reinstatement model provides a suitable preclinical model of relapse to drug taking.The data derived from studies using the reinstatement model suggest that the neuronal events that mediate drug-, cue- and stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking are not identical, that the mechanisms underlying drug-induced reinstatement are to some degree different from those mediating drug discrimination or reward, and that the duration of the withdrawal period following cocaine and heroin self-administration has a profound effect on reinstatement induced by drug cues and stress. Finally, there appears to be a good correspondence between the events that induce reinstatement in laboratory animals and those that provoke relapse in humans.",

        "abstract": "Using a rat relapse model, we previously reported that re-exposing rats to a drug-associated context, following extinction of operant responding in a different context, reinstates heroin seeking. In an initial pharmacological characterization, we found that the mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268, which acts centrally to reduce evoked glutamate release, attenuates context-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking when injected systemically or into the ventral tegmental area, the cell body region of the mesolimbic dopamine system. Here, we tested whether injections of LY379268 into the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a terminal region of the mesolimbic dopamine system, would also attenuate context-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking. Rats were trained to self-administer heroin; drug infusions were paired with a discrete tone-light cue. Subsequently, lever pressing was extinguished in the presence of the discrete cue in a context that differed from the drug self-administration context in terms of visual, auditory, tactile, and circadian cues. After extinction of responding, LY379268 was injected to different groups of rats into the NAc core or shell or into the caudate-putamen, a terminal region of the nigrastriatal dopamine system. Injections of LY379268 into the NAc shell (0.3 or 1.0 microg) dose-dependently attenuated context-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking. Injections of 1.0 microg of LY379268 into the NAc core had no effect, while a higher dose (3.0 microg) decreased this reinstatement. Injections of LY379268 (3.0 microg) 1.5 mm dorsal from the NAc core into the caudate-putamen were ineffective. Results suggest an important role of glutamate transmission in the NAc shell in context-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking.",

Using a rat relapse model, we determined the effect of a group II metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist [LY379268 ((-)-2-oxa-4-aminobicylco hexane-4,6-dicarboxylic acid)] on contextual cue-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking. LY379268, which acts centrally to reduce evoked glutamate release, was injected systemically or directly into the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a brain area involved in opiate reward and conditioned drug effects. Rats were trained to self-administer intravenous heroin for 12 d; drug infusions were paired with a discrete tone-light cue. Subsequently, lever pressing was extinguished in the presence of the discrete cue in a context that differed from the drug self-administration context in terms of visual, auditory, tactile, and circadian cues. After extinction of lever responding, LY379268 was injected systemically or into the VTA, and nonreinforced responding was determined in the extinction context or the drug context. Exposure to the heroin-associated context induced robust reinstatement of drug seeking, and this effect was attenuated by systemic or intra-VTA injections of LY379268.

Here, we explored the role of the amygdala extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway in this incubation. Cocaine seeking induced by exposure to cocaine cues was substantially higher after 30 withdrawal days than after 1 withdrawal day. Exposure to these cues increased ERK phosphorylation in the central, but not the basolateral, amygdala after 30 d, but not 1 d, of withdrawal. After 30 d of withdrawal from cocaine, inhibition of central, but not basolateral, amygdala ERK phosphorylation decreased cocaine seeking. After 1 d of withdrawal, stimulation of central amygdala ERK phosphorylation increased cocaine seeking. Results suggest that the incubation of cocaine craving is mediated by time-dependent increases in the responsiveness of the central amygdala ERK pathway to cocaine cues.",

Processes involved in drug addiction can be studied under controlled experimental conditions in laboratory animals, using the intravenous drug self-administration, conditioned place preference and reinstatement procedures. The intravenous drug self-administration and conditioned place preference procedures are regarded as suitable animal models of drug reinforcement, and the reinstatement procedure is an animal model of drug relapse. Our review of the findings from rat studies using these animal models indicates that while stressors are important modulators of opiate- and psychostimulant-reinforced behavior, the effects of stressors on behavior in the above models is stressor-specific, and to some degree also procedure-specific and drug-specific. We also review data from studies on the neuronal mechanisms involved in the effects of different stressors on opiate and psychostimulant self-administration, conditioned place preference and reinstatement. Finally, we briefly discuss the implications of the data reviewed for future research and for the treatment of drug addiction.",

        "abstract": "Results from studies using molecular and genetic methods in humans and rodents suggest that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in the behavioral effects of abused drugs, making understanding of its genomic structure and regulation of substantial interest. Recently, we have reported that the human BDNF gene contains seven upstream exons that can each be spliced independently to the major BDNF coding exon to form diverse bipartite BDNF transcripts. We also identified a novel \"BDNFOS\" gene that is transcribed to produce alternatively spliced natural antisense transcripts (NATs); its fifth exon overlaps with the protein coding exon VIII of human BDNF. To better understand BDNF's genomic structure and differential regulation, we now describe the rodent BDNF gene and transcripts. This gene includes six bipartite transcripts that are generated by six independently transcribed exons, each of which is spliced to a major coding exon and a tripartite transcript that is composed of two upstream exons and one coding exon. In addition, we found no evidence for antisense, opposite strand BDNFOS gene transcripts in mice or rats. The BDNF rodent splice variants display specific patterns of differential expression in different brain regions and peripheral tissues. Acute cocaine administration increased striatal expression of a specific BDNF4 splice variant by up to 5-fold. Interestingly, however, neither experimenter- nor self-administered chronic cocaine administration enhanced striatal BDNF expression. These data suggest a role of specific BDNF promoter regions and regulatory sequences in stimulant-induced alterations in BDNF expression, and in the alterations that changed BDNF expression is likely to confer in the brain.",

        "abstract": "Using a rat relapse model, recent studies reported time dependent increases in cocaine seeking induced by re-exposure to cocaine cues, but not cocaine itself, over withdrawal periods of up to 3 months.In the present study, we explored the time course of cocaine seeking induced by priming injections of heroin over the first 3 months of withdrawal from cocaine.Rats were trained to self-administer intravenous cocaine for 6 h/day over a period of 10 days. Cocaine seeking induced by heroin priming was then assessed in different groups of rats after 1 day, and 1 and 3 months of withdrawal from cocaine. During the test day, rats were first given six 1-h extinction sessions. Subsequently, reinstatement of cocaine seeking induced by non-contingent saline and heroin injections (0.125 and 0.25 mg/kg, s.c.) was assessed during three 1-h sessions.As in previous studies, extinction responding was substantially greater after 1 and 3 months of withdrawal than after 1 day. More importantly, we also found that the effect of heroin priming on reinstatement of cocaine seeking is time dependent, with higher responding occurring after 1 and 3 months than after 1 day.The present results replicate previous findings on the time dependent increases in resistance to extinction after withdrawal from cocaine, and further indicate that the duration of the drug withdrawal period is a critical modulator of the effect of heroin priming on cocaine seeking. These data may have implications for the treatment of cocaine relapse induced by other drugs.",

Here, we summarize data from studies that further characterized this incubation phenomenon and briefly discuss its implications for drug addiction. The main findings of our ongoing research are: 1. Incubation of cocaine craving is long-lasting, but not permanent: cocaine seeking induced by exposure to cocaine cues remains elevated for up to 3 months of withdrawal, but decreases after 6 months. 2. Incubation of reward craving is not drug specific: sucrose seeking induced by re-exposure to the reward cues also increases after withdrawal, but for a time period that is shorter than that of cocaine. 3. Incubation of cocaine craving is not evident after acute re-exposure to cocaine itself: cocaine seeking induced by cocaine priming injections remains essentially unchanged over the first 6 months of withdrawal. 4. Incubation of cocaine craving after withdrawal is associated with increases in the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in mesolimbic dopamine areas.",

        "abstract": "Cocaine addiction in humans is associated with long-term propensity to relapse. Using a rat relapse model, we found that cocaine seeking induced by exposure to cocaine-associated cues progressively increases after withdrawal. This progressive increase is associated with increases in brain-derived nerve growth factor (BDNF) levels within the mesolimbic dopamine system. Based on these findings, we studied whether BDNF infusions into the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the cell body region of mesolimbic dopamine neurons, would potentiate cocaine seeking after withdrawal. Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine for 10 d, and cocaine seeking was measured in extinction tests 3, 10, or 30 d after withdrawal. During testing, rats were exposed to contextual cues that had predicted cocaine availability during training, and lever presses resulted in contingent presentations of a discrete tone-light cue that was previously temporally paired with cocaine infusions. BDNF (0-0.75 microg/site) or nerve growth factor (NGF; 0-0.75 microg/site) was infused into the VTA 1-2 hr after the last self-administration session. To examine the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in BDNF effects, U0126 (1 microg/site), an MEK inhibitor, was used. A single intra-VTA infusion of BDNF, but not NGF, induced long-lasting enhancement of cocaine seeking for up to 30 d, an effect reversed by U0126. In contrast, neither BDNF infusions into the substantia nigra, nor acute intra-VTA BDNF infusions 2 hr before testing on day 3 of withdrawal, were effective. These data suggest that BDNF-mediated neuroadaptations in mesolimbic areas are involved in the persistent cocaine seeking induced by exposure to drug cues after withdrawal.",

The corresponding analytical solutions on temperature response are acquired based on combined heat transfer case; the model take the spiral coils arrangement and their pitches inside piles into consideration and identify the differences between the new models and those former models which did not treat spiral tube as a series of separate coils along the z-axial direction. The influence exerted on temperature response by every parameter was investigated. Two cases were compared, i.e. pure conduction and combined heat transfer including both conduction and convection. The relevant calculations prove that the heat transfer efficiency between pile foundation GHEs and the surrounding underground medium can be improved especially when some parameters attain a certain extent.

The idea of combining the GHE with building foundation piles, i.e., the \"energy pile,\" has arisen in recent years. The novel pile GHEs consisting of vertical spiral coils buried in the piles of a building, are proposed for their flexibility and convenience for applications. Evolved from existing models, a new spiral source model and its analytical solutions are established in this article for thermal analysis and design of the pile GHEs. The temperature field of the pile and its surrounding soil is simulated; in addition, the temperature responses of the coil pipe wall and the circulating water entering/effusing the pile GHE to the short time-step heat transfer loads are deduced based on the new spiral source model. The study indicates that the heat transfer features of the novel pile GHE can be described adequately by the proposed new spiral heat source model, which provides an appropriate tool for thermal analysis and design of the novel pile GHE or other potential similar engineering problems.

        "abstract": "Research highlights \u25ba We investigated four measures to enhance the electro-osmotic regeneration system. \u25ba The use of platinum-plated titanium anode effectively improved the work lifetime. \u25ba Application of filter cloth could significantly enhance the regeneration rate. \u25ba The interrupted power was found to enhance the regeneration rate up to 1.5 times. \u25ba Optimal electric field strength ranges from 8.5 to 13 Vcm \u22121 in regeneration system. Abstract Electro-osmotic regeneration for the solid desiccant has been proved to have many merits such as regeneration without the heat source; energy-saving and simple structure. However; the previous work has revealed that its performance is seriously limited by the severe Joule heating effect and electrode corrosion; which demands further improvement to meet the practical requirement. In this paper; four possible improvement methods are investigated experimentally; including changing the material of anode; changing layout of cathode; applying the interrupted power and optimizing the electrical field strength. Through detailed experiments and analysis; we found that applying the platinum-plated titanium mesh as anode could improve the working lifetime from 6 h to over 120 h and effectively reduce Joule heating effect simultaneously; laying a piece of filter cloth under the cathode could enhance the EO regeneration rate up to 0.0021 g s \u22121 ; the application of interrupted power could increase the regeneration rate up to 1.5 times; the optimal on\u2013off-time was found at 30 s:1.3 s with 17 V cm \u22121 electric field strength and 30 s:0.8 s with 11 V cm \u22121 ; and the most suitable value of electric field strength was observed as ranging from 8.5 to 13 V cm \u22121 in our EO regeneration system.

Because of the separate control of latent load to make a more comfortable indoor environment; the desiccant dehumidification air-conditioning system has drawn increasing attentions [2,3] . And it also has other strong points such as the energy-saving; the reduction of the use of chlorofluorocarbons and so on [4\u20136] . To make the desiccant work repeatedly; regeneration components are required in the dehumidification systems; which are encouraged to be driven by the waste or renewable energy. [7,8] . The electro-osmotic (EO) regeneration; which has been concerned by many researchers these years; was first proposed in 2004. This novel regeneration method is proposed to regenerate the solid desiccant in a humidity independent control system; with the application of EO force generated by the external electric field. In 2004; Mina and Newell [9] conducted a primary theoretical research about the EO regeneration and found it feasible in the theoretical analysis. In 2007; Zhang and Yu [10] put a zeolite desiccant with an electric field into a high humidity box. However; no water was removed from the desiccant in their experiment. In 2010; Qi et al. [11] validated the possibility of the EO regeneration with the artificial zeolite desiccant experimentally; and the maximum regeneration rate observed was 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22127 kg m \u22121 s \u22121 V \u22121 . In their investigation; the whole process of EO regeneration was found to be divided into three phases. However; in the preliminary work; the performance of the EO regeneration system was found to be seriously impaired because of the Joule heating effect and electrode corrosion. The Joule heating effect; which was caused by the high initial current; led to a considerable reduction of the water removal rate in the first 2\u20133 h. The electrode corrosion; which is generated by the electrolytic reactions; not only substantially limited the lifetime of the system; but also reduced the water removal rate. Moreover; the layout of the electrode was considered to play a significant role in the EO regeneration; which required further experiments and investigations to determine the details. And the effect of electric field strength also required further research to find out the optimum parameters. In conclusion; in order to improve the potential of the EO regeneration system for practical application; a system with better performance; including longer work life; higher regeneration rate and stability; is expected. In this essay; we developed and verified four methods to enhance the performance of the EO regeneration system by detailed experiments; including changing the material of anode; changing the layout of cathode; introducing the interrupted power and changing the electrical field strength. During the tests; the optimal control parameters of the improvements were also investigated. 2 Test bench As shown in the Fig. 1 ; the brief principle of the EO regeneration method is because of the rearrangement of the ions; the adsorbed water in the internal channel of the solid desiccant is driven by the electro-osmotic force from the anode to the cathode [11] . According to the previous research; the mean benefits of the EO regeneration are: (1) no heat source required; (2) simple structure (only a DC power supply needed); (3) suitable for renewable energy application. Fig. 2 shows a schematic of the EO regeneration system. The sample box is filled with the artificial zeolite powder (Radius: 200\u2013250 \u03bcm). A DC power supply is used to provide specified electric field across the electrodes; which is located on the top and bottom surface of the sample. The relative humidity of the test chamber is maintained at 95 \u00b1 3%; with the continuous inputting moist air generated by a supersonic oscillation humidifier. The measurement devices applied in this experiment are listed in Table 1 . During the experiment; all the required data were collected by a data logger and then delivered to a computer in every five minutes. It is noted that both EO and gravitational forces could remove water from the solid desiccant. So the amount of the removed water should be measured in the condition with and without the electric field to calculate the water removal rate by only electro-osmosis; which is the most significant assessment parameter of the performance. The first step of the experiment is: According to the different methods; adjust the experimental system; including changing the applied electric field strength; the structure of the sample box; the material of anode and introducing the interrupted power. The detailed adjustments were listed in the following parts of this essay. The following steps of the test are similar to our previous experiments; which are shown in the literature [11] . In all the sub-tests listed in part 3\u20136; the thickness of the sample between two electrodes was 15 mm; and the desiccant powder about 5 mm thick was covered above the anode. The porosity of the desiccant was kept around 80% after the adsorption period (Step (1) in [11] ). For further discussion; the water removal rate by electro-osmosis ( m \u02d9 we ; g s \u22121 ) is defined as the difference between the water quantity removed by gravity and that removed by both EO and gravitational forces per unit time ( m \u02d9 weg ; g s \u22121 ). 3 Anode material 3.1 Methodology In 2007; Sivapullaiah found that the electrode corrosion caused rapid increase of resistance in the EO soil concretion; which could be avoided by anti-corrosion electrodes [12] . However; whether the result can be applied in EO regeneration for solid desiccant needs further verification. Two types of anode; the conventional stainless steel mesh and the platinum-plated titanium mesh; were tested. Platinum was chosen for its excellent anti-corrosion performance in electro-osmotic pump applications [13] . However; the high cost of pure platinum anode prohibits the widespread use of it; especially in practical projects. So we selected titanium; which is considered as an economic-friendly material with high strength and anti-corrosion characteristics; as the base of the anode. The thickness of the coating was 1 \u03bcm; and both sides of the base were plated with the platinum. Sample with two different materials of anode was referred as A1 (stainless steel mesh) and A2 (platinum-plated titanium mesh); respectively. The applied exterior power was 17 V cm \u22121 in both conditions. And the layout of cathode inside the sample box was set as L1; which was to be described in the next chapter. 3.2 Results As shown in Fig. 3 a; it was noticed that after first 3 h of the test; serious electrode corrosion was observed on the stainless steel mesh electrode. The corrosion is caused by water electrolytic reaction; which means Fe (the main element of the anode) was transformed into Fe 3+ constantly and dissolved into water during the EO regeneration. However; the platinum-plated titanium mesh was insoluble and steady in the electrolytic reaction throughout the test with a total time beyond 120 h; as shown in Fig. 3 b. And no visible change was found on the surface of anode; and a longer operation-time could be predicted. The experimental results of sample A1 and A2; including the time of Phase 1 and 2; peak and initial current; were shown in Table 2 . Phase 1 refers to the process of the EO regeneration impacted by the serious Joule effect; which should be shortened. And Phase 2 is proofed to be the most effective period in the EO regeneration and should be lengthened as long as possible. The detailed description of Phase 1 and 2 are referred in literature [11] . As shown in the Fig. 4 ; the m weg and current of the first 4 h in the experiment presented large difference between sample A1 and A2. From Table 2 and Fig. 4 ; it is noticed that the initial current of A2 was evidently lower than that of A1; especially in the first half hour. Although the m weg of A2 was not as high as that of A1 in first few minutes; the shorter time period of Phase 1 of A2 could make up the difference. And then the m weg of A2 kept ahead during the experiment. It is clear that the performance of EO regeneration was highly improved by the application of the platinum-plated titanium anode. First; because of the reversible reaction of this anode (Pt + 2OH \u2212 \u21d4 Pt(OH) 2 + 2e \u2212 ) in the EO regeneration; the anode could not be corroded. So the work lifetime of the system (the time of Phase 2) was considerably increased from around 6 h to over 120 h. And no visible changes were found on the surface of anode. The corrosion was considered to have a serious negative effect to the performance of the EO regeneration for three reasons. (a) The anode was corroded rapidly during the regeneration process and the area was reduced; which would seriously reduce the water removal rate. (b) It could cause the insoluble substance deposit into the material; which led to the increase of resistance and the decrease of current. (c) When the anode was wholly corroded; the EO regeneration would stop. So the platinum-plated titanium anode significantly enhanced the practical application potential of the new regeneration method. Moreover; the use of titanium anode; which was made of inert metal with low electric conductivity; effectively reduced the initial current and the Joule heating effect. (The serious Joule heat effect caused by high initial current; which happened in the application of ordinary anode; not only led to the stagnation of EO regeneration of 2\u20133 h (Phase 1); but also added extra cooling load to the air-conditioning system.) As shown in Table 2 ; at the beginning process of the regeneration; compared to the corroded anode; the peak and mean initial current of using platinum-plated titanium anode reduced around 80%. 4 Layout of cathode 4.1 Methodology In the previous experiment; it was found that a thin drenched layer (filter cloth) under the cathode had a significant influence on the water removal rate m we \u2217 ) of the EO regeneration [11] . And different layouts between the layer and cathode may have different effects to the regeneration rate. So we designed four kinds of layout; with the different relative position between the cathode and filter cloth inside the sample box; to investigate the detail effect of the drenched layer. As shown in the Table 3 ; the layout was named L1; L2; L3 and L4; respectively. During the test; the applied electric strength was 17 V cm \u22121 in all conditions. And the anode was the platinum-plated titanium mesh. 4.2 Results The EO regeneration rates with four different layouts in Phase 2 were shown in Table 4 . To make the result more accurate; we repeated the experiment four times with every layout inside the sample box. From the results; it is clear that when the sample was fitted with the cathode only (L3); the EO regeneration rate was quite low. If a layer of filter cloth was added under the cathode; the regeneration rate increased; even without any measures (L2). As the trestle was used to keep the contact area between the cathode and the filter cloth as large as possible (L1); the average regeneration rate conspicuously increased. However; if the layer of filter cloth was placed upon the cathode (L4; the filter cloth was fitted between the desiccant and cathode); the water removal quantity by gravity only was superior than the water removal quantity by both gravity and EO forces; which means the EO regeneration rate became negative in this condition. The possible reason of the results might be that the influences on the flow pattern inside the micro-channels of desiccant varied from these four kinds of layout. In 2006; Buhai et al. [14] published that different flow patterns between open and close electrodes in the micro-channels and their influences. As shown in Fig. 5 a; the simulation results show that the impermeable electrodes lead to a cyclic flow pattern inside the pore of the desiccant; which makes the whole flow rate weaken significantly. However; it is contrast to the system with permeable electrodes represented by Fig. 5 b. In our experiment; the cathode with a layer of filter cloth above was similar to the first one; in which the cyclic flow pattern caused the reduction of water removal quantity by both forces. In contrast; when the filter cloth was placed under the cathode with a trestle; the sample box system was more similar to the second one because of the water absorption effect of cloth. So the flow direction was almost from the anode to cathode; which means that the EO regeneration could have a better performance in this condition. And the level of the flow pattern approaching to the ideal one increases as the increase of the contact area between the cathode and the filter cloth. So the use of trestle could result in higher performance of the regeneration system. 5 Interrupted power 5.1 Methodology In EO soil concretion; it has been proved that interrupted power can remove more water than continuous power in electro-osmotic dewatering by Robie in 1994 [15] ; and then Gopalakrishnan et al. found that there was an optimal off-time which yields maximum water removal in 1996 [16] . However; there is no experimental investigation to validate whether the measure could enhance the EO regeneration rate or not; and to find out the optimal on/off-time in the specified electric field strength. Based on this consideration; we tested the EO regeneration with the interrupted power supply; by the time-delay relay which could periodically interrupt the power and simultaneously short-circuited the electrodes. To find out the optimal parameter of the method; we fixed the on-time (time of connection) at 30 s; and change the off-time (time of interruption) from 0.1 s to 2 s. Besides; according to the results above; we applied the platinum-plated titanium anode and laid the sample box as layout L1. 5.2 Results The enhanced percentage of EO regeneration rate; which means the ratio between m we \u2217 gained with and without the time-delay relay; was shown in Fig. 6 . As shown in the results; the interrupted power generated by the relay significantly enhanced the regeneration rate up to 1.5 times; comparing with the condition without it. The energy-saving potential could also be improved; consequently. The main reasons were: (a) Because of the electrolytic reaction; H + was generated on the anode and OH \u2212 was generated on the cathode persistently. Then these ions assembled at the opposite electrode with the water flow and caused the decrease of the effective electric field. The interrupted power resists the reduction by neutralizing the positive and negative ions in electrodes during the off-time; (b) In the conventional EO regeneration; the Zeta potential near the anode decreases because of the pH decrease [17] caused by the electrolytic reaction; which reduces the EO regeneration rate. The interrupted power reverses the electrode reaction on the anode and thus the pH near the anode increases during the off-time. However; during the off-time; the electric field inside the desiccant was opposite; which caused the reversed water flow. As a result; if the off-time was set too long; the EO regeneration rate would decrease. So an optimal ratio between the on and off-time should be investigated to present the better enhancing effect. As shown in the Fig. 6 ; the optimal on/off-time was found at 30 s:1.3 s with the applied electric field strength at 17 V cm \u22121 ; and the optimal on/off-time was 30 s:0.8 s with the applied electric field strength at 11 V cm \u22121 . Based on our previous research [1] ; to compare with other regeneration methods; the energy consumption is represented by the energy consumption rate. The rate is defined as the ratio of the energy consumed and the moisture mass removed. As shown in Table 5 ; the energy consumption rate of the EO regeneration was relative lower than several other methods. If the improvements (changing layout of cathode and introducing in the interrupted power) are applied properly in the EO regeneration system; the regeneration rate will increase and the consumption rate will be further reduced to 1.0 \u00d7 10 3 kJ kg \u22121 . It is proved that the improved EO regeneration system has higher energy-saving potential. 6 Electric field strength 6.1 Methodology In the conventional electro-osmosis theory; the EO flow rate was verified to vary directly with the electric field strength. For instance; Yao et al. found that increasing the electric field strength would linearly raise the maximum flow rate of EO pump in 2003 [18] . However; whether the relationship is correct in the EO regeneration system needs further verification. In this test; we changed the applied electric strength from 0 to 20 V cm \u22121 by a tunable DC power. For the better performance of the system; we applied the platinum-plated titanium anode and layout L1 in the test. The time-delay relay was not included in the circle because of the changing of electric field strength. 6.2 Results As shown in the Fig. 7 ; it is clear that the EO regeneration rate was not proportional to the electric field strength. The main reason was the mismatch of the adsorption and regeneration (desorption) of the desiccant. As shown in the Fig. 8 ; when the electric field strength was raised; the temperature of desiccant increased accordingly because of the more serious Joule heat effect. Higher temperature not only significantly impacted the adsorption ability of the artificial zeolite [18] ; but also improved the evaporation of the water inside. Because of the evaporation and reduction of adsorption; the porosity of the desiccant decreased rapidly; which caused the serious decrease of EO regeneration rate [19] . As shown in Fig. 7 ; when the applied field strength was adjusted at 8.5\u201313 V cm \u22121 ; the m we \u2217 was superior compared to other conditions; which means that the most suitable value of electric field strength ranges from 8.5 to 13 V cm \u22121 for our EO regeneration system. It was verified that it is possible to obtain higher regeneration rate in EO regeneration system by applying the optimal electric field strength. However; it should be noticed that the optimal value varies with the type of desiccant; the structure of system; the operation parameters and environment and so on. 7 Summary In this essay; we experimented and analyzed four measures to enhance the performance of the EO regeneration system. From the results; several conclusions are listed as follow: (a) The use of platinum-plated titanium mesh anode improved the work lifetime of the system from 6 h to over 120 h; and effectively reduced the initial current and the Joule heating effect. (b) Application of a layer of filter cloth closely under the cathode with a trestle could significantly enhance the EO regeneration rate up to 0.0021 g s \u22121 . Besides; putting the filter cloth between the desiccant and cathode made the EO regeneration rate negative because of the cyclic flow inside the desiccant. (c) The interrupted power enhanced the regeneration rate up to 1.5 times compared with the condition without it. And the optimal on\u2013off-time was found at 30 s:1.3 s with 17 V cm \u22121 and 30 s:0.8 s with 11 V cm \u22121 . (d) Because of the mismatch of adsorption and regeneration characteristics of desiccant; the most suitable value of electric field strength ranges from 8.5 to 13 V cm \u22121 in our EO regeneration system. The improvement of the EO regeneration performance improves the potential of practical use and energy-saving. The further work includes investigating whether the improved EO regeneration system could work under the ordinary summer outdoor environment and finding the influencing factors of it.

        "title": "Investigation on heat transfer around buried coils of pile foundation heat exchangers for ground-coupled heat pump applications",
        "abstract": "The application of ground heat exchangers (GHEs) has attracted much attention for its advantages in terms of energy-saving and emission-reduction. Therefore, it is significant to introduce heat transfer into investigation, the paper illustrated the existing heat transfer models in order to analyze the GHEs with buried coils. Line heat source, cylindrical heat source and ring-coil heat source are introduced step by step. For the present, the borehole GHEs are the mainstream, and in recent years pile foundation GHEs have been followed with interest on account of heat transfer superiority as well as lowering initial cost and saving land area. Concerning that groundwater flow exist in geological stratum sometimes, so that the thermal analysis about heat transfer should be composed of two cases, i.e. models under the condition of both pure conduction and combination that include conduction and advection. It is obvious that ring-coil model is on the verge of actual situation for pile foundation GHEs with buried coils from the academic research perspectives, nevertheless for some engineering computation problems which the result error can be permitted in the certain range, other heat transfer models can be chosen in order to simplify the calculation process. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The analytical solutions of the temperature response in the heat transfer process including heat conduction and convection were obtained. The impact of groundwater flow on the heat transfer has been investigated. The heat transfer processes with and without groundwater flow were compared. It was found thatgroundwater flow has a considerable effect on the heat transfer process, especially when the groundwater flow velocity attains a certain order of magnitude. If the system is designed reasonably and groundwater temperature is below a certain range, groundwater flow is favorable to the heat transfer between the foundation pile ground heat exchangers (GHEs) and surrounding ground medium, and can improve the energy performance of the heating and cooling system of the ground-coupled heat pump for energy conservation of buildings. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "In this article, a transient simulation model and the EnergyPlus were used to study the energy performance and economical feasibility for integrating a solar liquid desiccant dehumidification system with a conventional vapor compression air-conditioning system for the weather condition of Hong Kong. The vapor compression system capacity in the solar assisted air-conditioning system can be reduced to 19 kW from original 28 kW of a conventional air-conditioning system as a case study due to the solar desiccant cooling. The economical performance of the solar desiccant dehumidification system is compared with that of the conventional air-conditioning system. The results show that the energy saving potentials due to incorporation of the solar desiccant dehumidification system in a traditional air-conditioning system is significant for the hot wet weather in Hong Kong due to higher COP resulted from higher supply chilled water temperature from chiller plants. The annual operation energy savings for the hybrid system is 6760 kWh and the payback period of the hybrid system is around 7 years. The study shows that the solar assisted air-conditioning is a viable technology for utilizations in subtropical areas.

The feasibility of using desiccant dehumidification has been studied by Davangere et al. (1999a,b), Mateus and Oliveira (2009) and Kaushik et al. (1991) . The annual energy performance and energy saving potentials of using liquid desiccant were reported by Nesreen et al. (2003), Liu et al. (2006), Khalid et al. (1997), Ghali (2008), Yadav (1995), Dai et al. (2001) and Yang and Yan (1992) . Certain performance enhancement measures that affect the system performance (such as energy storage and heat recovery) have also been investigated by Oliveti et al. (2000) and Zhang (2006) . Solar radiation is mainly used as energy source, which is collected by common solar collectors, to re-concentrate the dilute desiccant solution. The open cycle solar collector, on the other hand, utilizes not only the solar energy but also the unsaturated air as regeneration energy source. It is possible to make humid area, like Hong Kong, to use solar desiccant dehumidification system. However, not much work has been done to investigate the performance of the liquid desiccant dehumidification/regeneration air-conditioning system with open cycle solar C/R. In this paper, the transient performance of the solar liquid desiccant dehumidification/regeneration air-conditioning system and a vapor compression air-conditioning system is studied using synoptically generated weather data of Hong Kong. The solar liquid desiccant system of the present study replaces a 28.8 kW vapor compression unit for a typical office in Hong Kong characterized by a high ventilation rate and high latent load. Based on the hourly simulation studies for a wide range of recorded ambient conditions of Hong Kong, this program can predict the annual energy consumption of the solar liquid desiccant air-conditioning system in comparison with the conventional vapor compression system which is simulated using the EnergyPlus for the entire A/C season. An economical analysis is performed for the integrated solar desiccant air-conditioning system compared with the conventional vapor compression system. 2 Problem formulation 2.1 Local weather data For applications requiring prediction of annual performance and design of energy systems, there are two kinds of annual weather data in general use in Hong Kong, one is the typical meteorological year (TMY) developed by Chan et al. (2006) and another is the example weather year or test reference year (TRY) developed by Wong and Ngan (1993) . Both of these two kinds of weather data consider the weighting factor of the annual and monthly mean values of major weather indices, and the month with the smallest deviation from the mean value is taken as \u2018standard\u2019 month or \u2018typical\u2019 year. Selection of the TMY or TRY highly relays on the weighting factors of the different metrological variables. For strict statistical significance, different energy systems will have different TMYs or TRYs. The aforementioned weather data are mostly for building energy simulation and may not be appropriate to address the renewable energy application systems such as the open cycle solar desiccant dehumidification air-conditioning system. In this study, a new series of weather data which were generated by the first order multivariate Markov chain model were used to drive the simulation model. This new weather data is based on 15 years of actual hourly weather data of Hong Kong and dose not relay on the weighting factors, which makes it suitable for simulating the energy systems with more than one dominant weather variables. Fig. 1 shows one set of simulated weather data. The statistical characteristics of the generated weather are compared with the long-term average value of the real weather data, TMY and TRY. The comparison includes annual average value, standard deviation, yearly maximum value and minimum value. The results reveal that the simulated weather data well preserved the characteristics of the real weather data and the relative errors are all within 5% magnitude. In order to ensure that the traditional vapor compression air-conditioning system and the solar desiccant air-conditioning system are evaluated by the same stick-yard, the new weather data was converted to an EPW file which can be read by the EnergyPlus in the building energy simulation process. 2.2 Building energy simulation using EnergyPlus The objective of the work is to compare the energy performance between the hybrid desiccant air-conditioning system and the conventional air-conditioning system for a high latent load application in a subtropical area like Hong Kong. The selected building is a 130 m 2 office building located on the first floor of a building characterized by a \u2018L\u2019 shape. The building is oriented due north. A single glazing window of 3 mm is installed on south wall. The window to wall area ratio is approximately 0.07. The walls consist of 2.5 cm stucco over 10 cm common brick and gypboard. The roof is a built up roof with 1.5 cm stone above 1 cm felt over 2.5 cm dense insulation supported by 5 cm heavy weight concrete. The shape and orientation of the building are shown in Fig. 2 . The length of the office is 10 m and its width and height are 5 m and 3 m, respectively. The heat transfer coefficients ( U -value) are 0.4 W/(m 2 \u00b0C) for roof, 3 W/(m 2 \u00b0C) for wall, 2.19 W/(m 2 \u00b0C) for partition, 1.03 W/(m 2 \u00b0C) for floor, and 6.17 W/(m 2 \u00b0C) for windows. The internal lighting heat gain is set at 2343 W and the equipment heat gain is taken as 7322 W. It is assumed that 10 occupants are working in the building. To evaluate the dehumidification ability of the solar desiccant air-conditioning system, the moisture gain from the occupant and the fresh air flow rate are both set at the maximum value, i.e. 0.4 kg/(h person) and 133 m 3 /(h person), respectively. The indoor design conditions are 24 \u00b0C of dry bulb air temperature and 55% of relative humidity. The cooling load of the space was calculated on an hourly basis using the EnergyPlus. The sensible and latent loads required for maintaining the building at the specified indoor conditions of temperature and humidity are calculated for the conventional VAV system design. The peak cooling load is 28.8 kW, consisting of a sensible part of 22.8 kW and a latent part of 6.0 kW. The monthly cooling energy consumption is also evaluated by the EnergyPlus, as presented in Fig. 3 . The results reveal that in a subtropical area like Hong Kong, cooling provision is almost needed throughout the whole year. This may explain why the energy consumption of air conditioning is the dominant building energy consumption which is around 40\u201370% of the total annual energy consumption of a commercial building. Fig. 3 also shows that during the summer seasons from May to September the latent cooling load is more than 40% of the total cooling load. The high percentage of latent cooling load in summer, which is the character of the building cooling load profile in this area, makes it hard for the conventional vapor compression air-conditioning system to accurately control the temperature and humidity simultaneously. The energy consumption for removing the water vapor in air is significant. 2.3 Solar desiccant air-conditioning system 2.3.1 System configuration Fig. 4 shows a schematic diagram of a solar desiccant air-conditioning system. Ambient humid air enters the supply air duct and passes through the packed type dehumidifier of the primary air handling unit where it will be dehumidified and heated by dry desiccant. After exiting from the primary air handling unit, the hot and dry air is then cooled by a cooling coil and then distributed to the room. The liquid desiccant solution is regenerated in the solar C/R. In this study, the inlet temperature of the diluted desiccant solution is set at the equilibrium temperature to balance the solar C/R\u2019s performance and the auxiliary energy consumption. The total heat energy required to regenerate the desiccant solution is partly supplied by the solar energy and the rest is supplied by an electrical auxiliary heater. To increase the diluted solution temperature, the desiccant solution from the dehumidifier passes through the heat exchanger and is heated by the hot desiccant solution leaving the solar C/R. If the solar radiation is not good and the solution temperature is still lower than the equilibrium temperature after passing through the heat exchanger, an auxiliary heater is used to heat the diluted desiccant solution to the desired temperature. An auxiliary heat source can be used to increase the temperature, e.g. by natural gas or electricity. In this study, electricity is used. 2.3.2 Simulation of system component \u2013 the solar C/R A brief description of the governing equations of each component in the system is provided in the following sections. A simplified simulation model has been developed by the author to predict the performance of the solar C/R. As the concentration of the desiccant solution change can be assumed to be negligible compared with the solution temperature over a short distance, the equilibrium humidity ratio of the desiccant solution can be considered to be the function of the solution temperature. Thus, the basic energy and mass balances of the solar C/R can be described by linear and non-homogeneous relationships: (1) d ( \u0394 T ) dNTU = - C \u2217 + 1 1 + Y a , avg \u00b7 R cv \u0394 T + C \u2217 Le \u0394 Y + 1 h \u00b7 \u03bb \u2217 C \u2217 ( I \u00b7 \u03b1 \u00b7 \u03c4 g - Q rad ) + Q con 1 + Y a , avg \u00b7 R cv (2) d ( \u0394 Y ) dNTU = S T \u00b7 \u03bb \u2217 \u00b7 C \u2217 \u0394 T - 1 Le ( 1 + S T \u00b7 \u03bb \u2217 \u00b7 C \u2217 ) \u0394 Y - S T \u00b7 C \u2217 h ( I \u00b7 \u03b1 \u00b7 \u03c4 g - Q rad ) where S T and \u03bb \u2217 are approximated as constants with narrow range of operating conditions for the regeneration processes; h is the convective heat transfer coefficient (kW/m 2 K); I represents the global solar irradiation on the collector area, (W/m 2 ); Le is the Lewis factor for the overall heat and mass transfer processes; Q con is the heat loss from the glazing cover to environment, (W/m 2 ); Q rad stands for radiation heat transfer from the solution film to the glass cover, (W/m 2 ); NTU is the number of heat transfer units; \u0394 T and \u0394 Y are the dimensionless variables which represent the driving force of heat and mass transfer between the desiccant solution and air. These two variables are defined as follows: (3) \u0394 T = ( T s - T a ) / \u03bb \u2217 and \u0394 Y = Y a - Y el Assuming that the coefficients in Eqs. (1) and (2) can all be approximated as constants, Eqs. (1) and (2) can be deemed as linear and non-homogeneous. The general solution of the two linear coupled equations is: (4) \u0394 T \u0394 Y = C 1 e \u03bb 1 NTU x k 1 \u00b7 e \u03bb 1 NTU x + C 2 e \u03bb 2 NTU x k 2 \u00b7 e \u03bb 2 NTU x + a 23 ( \u03bb 1 - \u03bb 2 ) - a 13 ( k 1 \u03bb 1 - k 2 \u03bb 2 ) \u03bb 1 \u03bb 2 ( k 1 - k 2 ) a 23 ( k 2 \u03bb 1 - k 1 \u03bb 2 ) - k 1 k 2 a 13 ( \u03bb 1 - \u03bb 2 ) \u03bb 1 \u03bb 2 ( k 1 - k 2 ) = C 1 e \u03bb 1 NTU x 1 k 1 + C 2 e \u03bb 2 NTU x 1 k 2 + D 1 D 2 where the roots of the characteristic equation can be found as: (5) \u03bb 12 = ( a 11 + a 22 ) \u00b1 ( a 11 + a 22 ) 2 - 4 ( a 11 a 22 - a 12 a 21 ) 2 The coefficients k 1 and k 2 in Eq. (4) are as follows: (6) k 1 = \u03bb 1 - a 11 a 12 and k 2 = \u03bb 2 - a 11 a 12 For the given initial conditions, the following equations for constants C 1 and C 2 can be obtained: (7) C 1 = \u0394 T i k 2 - \u0394 Y i - k 2 D 1 + D 2 ( k 2 - k 1 ) e \u03bb 1 \u00b7 NTU i and C 2 = - \u0394 T i k 1 + \u0394 Y i + k 1 D 1 - D 2 ( k 2 - k 1 ) e \u03bb 2 \u00b7 NTU i The above equations describe the air regeneration process in the solar C/R using liquid desiccant solution. Eq. (4) gives the driving potential of the heat and mass transfer, and the air outlet temperature, humidity ratio and solution outlet temperature of the control volume can be resolved. The first two parts of the RHS of Eq. (4) describe the heat and mass transfer phenomenon; the last part of the RHS of Eq. (4) represents the effect of climate conditions, especially solar radiation and ambient temperature. With this equation we can predict the outlet conditions of air temperature, humidity ratio and solution temperature. In order to use this analytical solution with confidence for predicting the outlet condition of the desiccant solution and amount of water evaporation, validation is needed. The accuracy is examined by the experiment outcome. Experiments were conducted in a lab-scale open cycle solar C/R. The experimental setup consists of solar collector/regenerator, fans, electrical heater, solution tanks, pumps, flow regulator/indicator, PID controller and data acquisition devices. The rectangular solar C/R dimensions are 2200 mm \u00d7 1200 mm with 100 mm air channel between the glass cover and blackened absorption plate. Lithium bromide\u2013water is chosen to be the working fluid. During the experiment, the inlet temperature, flow rate and concentration of the desiccant solution is controlled between 35\u201340 \u00b0C, 14.16\u201321.24 kg/h m (about 200\u2013300 ccm/min), and 20\u201325% respectively. It should be point out that the air flow velocity decreases quickly after first 0.5 m. The air flow at the end part of the solar C/R is as low as 0.3 m/s and in this case, the effect of nature convection cannot be neglected. It is necessary to involve Grashof number in the correlation equation to calculate the local Nusselt number and use measured air velocity profile to modify the initial assumed uniform air velocity. The results are shown in Fig. 5 with the predicted values of the analytical model. For both case, the temperature and humidity profiles are well preserved in the simplified model and the relative errors, which are defined as the difference of the simplified model and experimental values at different measure points divided by the experimental values, of air temperature, humidity ratio and solution temperature are less than 10%. The maximum difference happens in the rear part of the solar C/R where is mostly influenced by the fluctuation of ambient condition. 2.3.3 Simulation of the dehumidifier For annual performance study, the empirical correlations developed by Chung (1994) were adopted. The air and liquid flow rates, air and liquid inlet temperatures, column and packing dimensions, and the equilibrium properties of the desiccant solutions are involved in this model. The column efficiency for a given packing height flow rate geometry and liquid desiccant can be expressed as: (8) \u03b5 = 1 - 0.205 G in L in 0.174 exp 0.985 t G in t L in ( aZ ) 0.184 X 1.68 1 - 0.152 exp - 0.686 t G in t L in X 3.388 where X is defined as the fraction of the vapor pressure depression of the desiccant solution to the vapor pressure of pure water, ( P water \u2212 P solution )/ P water . In Eq. (8) , a is the heat and mass transfer area to volume ratio, m 2 /m 3 , and Z is the packing height, m. 2.3.4 Modelling of the heat exchanger Since the flow rates of the inlet diluted desiccant solution and the outlet hot concentrated desiccant solution are almost equal, and if their specific heats are assumed the same and the effectiveness of the heat exchanger can be written as follows: (9) \u03b5 ex = T in - T in \u2032 T in - T out 2.3.5 Modelling of the solution in the tank The desiccant solution in the solution tank is assumed to be well mixed and no concentration gradient exists in the solution tank. As the collected solar energy is stored in the form of chemical energy, the heat loss of the solution to the environment is set to zero and the temperature of the solution is equal to the ambient air temperature for all the time. 2.3.6 Modelling of the vapor compression subsystem The cooling load and the chiller power consumption of the vapor compression subsystem are different from those of the conventional air-conditioning system in two ways: firstly, the internal latent load and the latent fresh air load are all treated by the liquid desiccant solution. The chilled water only needs to meet the requirement of the sensible part of the cooling load; secondly, the sensible part of the cooling load can be handled by higher temperature chilled water. Increase of the chilled water temperature can significantly improve the energy performance of the chiller. To simplify the analysis process and to focus on the desiccant dehumidification system, the improvement of the chiller for increasing the chilled water temperature is estimated from the efficiency of an equivalent ideal Carnot refrigeration cycle. For a conventional air-conditioning system, the condensation temperature and evaporation temperature are assumed as 40 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C, respectively, and the COP of the chiller is assumed to be 3.5 as the chilled water of 15 \u00b0C can be used to remove the sensible heat in the processed air, the condensation temperature and evaporation temperature of the chiller in the solar desiccant air-conditioning system is assumed to be 40 \u00b0C and 13 \u00b0C. The corresponding ideal efficiency of the chiller in the solar desiccant air-conditioning system is calculated to be 10.6. Considering the validity of a real chiller, 40% of the energy efficiency\u2019s improvement can be expected. For the conventional vapor compression system, the average COP of the chiller is calculated to be 3.3 by the simulation software EnergyPlus. Thus, the average COP of the chiller in the solar desiccant air-conditioning system is estimated to be 4.62. The load of the vapor compression subsystem is calculated by: (10) Q C , C / R = Q C - M pa ( h a , out - h a , in ) where Q C is the total cooling load of the conventional vapor compression system, kW. h a , in is the enthalpy of the ambient air and h a , out is the enthalpy of the air leaving the dehumidifier, kJ/(kg K). M pa is the mass flow rate of the primary air, kg/(s m). The hourly cooling load is calculated by the EnergyPlus over the whole cooling season. In addition, the solar desiccant dehumidification/regeneration model is used to obtain the hourly condition of the process air leaving the dehumidifier during the cooling season. The hourly enthalpy, h a , out , is easily determined and thus the hourly load of the vapor compression subsystem can be determined over the whole cooling months. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Annual energy performance of the solar desiccant air-conditioning system In the solar desiccant air-conditioning system, the latent load is handled by the desiccant solution and the sensible load is mainly taken by the higher temperature chilled water. The electricity consumption of the chillers can be greatly reduced. Fig. 6 compares the monthly average power consumption of the chillers for these two air-conditioning systems. By introducing the solar desiccant dehumidification subsystem into the air-conditioning system, the chiller power consumption is reduced, especially during summer season when ambient air is very humid and the latent load accounts for a bigger share of the total cooling load. It is quite safe to replace the 28.8 kW (8.0 TR) chiller with a smaller 19 kW (5.0 TR) chiller due to the reduced latent cooling load. The total system energy saving potential cannot be determined just from the electric power consumption of the chillers. The energy performance of the solar desiccant dehumidification subsystem is needed in the evaluation of the total system performance. As the lowest inlet temperature of the desiccant solution is set at the equilibrium temperature with respect to the partial vapor pressure of ambient air, auxiliary energy is needed in those cloudy days when the outlet desiccant solution temperature is not high enough to heat the desiccant solution to the desired temperature. Fig. 7 illustrates the auxiliary energy consumption of the solar desiccant air-conditioning system. The area of the solar C/R is designed to be 24 m 2 and the solution tank capacity is 5 m 3 . It can be seen that the auxiliary power is mainly needed from June to October. Although solar radiation during these months is abundant, the air humidity ratio is also higher than that in other months. Higher humidity ratio requires higher inlet solution temperature. Further more, auxiliary power is mainly needed in early morning and late afternoon when solar radiation is comparatively lower. Generally, the outlet desiccant solution temperature is higher enough and can heat the inlet desiccant solution to the equilibrium temperature in a day. Most part of the heating energy is provided by the energy recovery heat exchanger and the consumption of the auxiliary energy is reasonable. For the solar collector/regeneration system, it is very important to balance the dehumidification task and the amount of water evaporation of the solar C/R to ensure continuous operation. Fig. 8 shows the hourly dehumidification capacity and water evaporation rate of a 32 m 2 solar C/R and 1 m 3 solution tank system. The annual dehumidification capacity and water evaporation rate of the 32 m 2 solar C/R are almost equal, i.e. 2.5 \u00d7 10 4 kg. Although the annual dehumidification task and water evaporation are balanced, mismatches between these two values still exist on monthly and daily basis. As the ambient condition fluctuates with unsteady characteristics, storage tanks are often needed in the soar desiccant air-conditioning system to ensure continuous operation of the whole system. The desiccant solution is suitable for energy storage. The energy storage capacity in liquid desiccants such as aqueous solutions of hygroscopic salts is up to 3.5 times higher than solid desiccants such as zeolites or silica gel (related to the same dehumidification process) ( Kaushik et al., 1991 ). In this study, the upper and lower limits of the desiccant solution are set at 50% and 25%, respectively. When the desiccant solution concentration is higher than 50%, the desiccant solution regeneration stops to avoid crystallization of the hygroscopic salts. When the solution concentration is lower than 25%, its ability to absorb moisture from air is too low to operate the dehumidification cycle effectively. Fig. 9 shows the effect of the solution tank capacity on the solution concentration. 3.2 Economic analysis To demonstrate the feasibility of this solar energy system, an economic feasibility analysis of the solar desiccant system has been made. The solar desiccant system is cost effective when its extra cost is less than the present value of the energy savings. The cost of the vapor compression system for the office with cooling load of 28 kW is about HK$20,000. When the desiccant system is integrated with a traditional A/C system, the desiccant dehumidifier can reduce the size of the vapor compression system to 19 kW and the cost of the chiller can be reduced to about HK$12,500. The open cycle solar C/R is not a market available product at present. As the structure of the open cycle solar C/R is almost the same as a flat panel solar hot water collector, the cost of the open cycle solar cycle can be estimated according to the price of a solar water heater, which can be estimated as HK$2000/m 2 . Installation cost is assumed to be included in this item as well. Other detailed component costs are listed in Table 1 . The total initial cost of the conventional vapor compression air-conditioning system is HK$79,040. For the solar desiccant dehumidification cycle, the initial cost varies according to the capacity of the solution tanks and area of the solar C/R. In Table 1 , two sets of the solar C/R area and solution tank capacity combinations are listed. Both of these two system configurations can ensure 99% reliability throughout the whole year. The following performance and operating cost analysis is mainly based on the second configuration which has lower initial investment. Fig. 10 shows the monthly energy savings when compared with the conventional vapor compression air-conditioning system. The monthly peak energy consumption is 2400 kWh in August. The annual air-conditioning energy index for the vapor compression system, which is defined as the annual energy consumption of the air-conditioning system divided by the total floor area, is 114.45 kWh/m 2 . When introducing the solar desiccant dehumidification system into the air-conditioning system, the energy index can be reduced to 52.09 kWh/m 2 . The advantage of the solar desiccant dehumidification system is more clearly revealed in Fig. 11 . The maximum relative energy saving is 59.65% in August. A higher portion of latent load in the total ventilation load leads to more energy saving. The simulation also reveals that the relative energy saving follows the trend of the latent load. For our case, the relative energy saving reaches its peak value from June to September, which are characterized as highly humid seasons. In other months, the relative energy saving is comparatively low, especially in March and November. The proposed liquid desiccant dehumidification system performs better in a highly humid climate. The operating energy cost of the integrated system over the whole cooling season is given by: (11) COST = ( E elec , chiller + E elec , pump + Q aux ) C e where E elec is the annual electric energy consumption of the chiller, pumps and fans in kWh and Q aux is the annual energy consumption of the electric heater in kWh. C e is the electricity price in HK$/kWh. In Hong Kong, the electric energy cost is around 0.9\u20131.17 HK$/kWh. In this study, 1 HK$/kWh is used. The life cycle savings (LCS) is the difference between the present value of the energy savings over the life cycle resulting from the use of the solar desiccant dehumidifier and the extra initial investment. If the result is positive, the desiccant system is worthy of the extra expenditure. A market discount rate of 8% and an inflation rate of 5% are used in the calculations. The life cycle of 20 years is considered for the two systems. For a set of specified economic parameters, the return on investment (ROI) can be determined. A positive LCS implies that the ROI is greater than the market discount rate. In this study, an initial extra expenditure C is needed at a market discount rate d of 0.08, in order to make a saving S in the yearly energy bill that is inflated at a rate e , 0.05 over a period N of 20 years. The system is assumed to have no resale value. The life cycle savings is then given by Duffie and Beckman (1980) : (12) LCS = - C + PWF ( N , e , d ) S where (13) PWF ( N , e , d ) = 1 d - e 1 - 1 + e 1 + d N if e \u2260 d (14) PWF ( N , e , d ) = N 1 + d if e = d As the area of the solar C/R increases from 20 m 2 to 36 m 2 shown in Fig. 12 , the LCS decreases linearly from HK$81,787 to HK$54,140, while the system reliability, which is defined as the ratio of the number of hours that can meet the dehumidification task and the total number of hours that need dehumidification, quickly increases from 85% to 100%. As the area of the solar C/R was fixed at 24 m 2 , the effect of the desiccant solution tank capacity on the LCS and the reliability was investigated. The results are illustrated in Fig. 13 . Generally speaking, the solution tank capacity and the area of solar C/R have the same effect on the LCS and reliability. As the price of the solution tank is cheaper than that of the solar C/R, increase of the solution tank capacity seems more economical. If these two system configurations (32/24 m 2 solar C/R and 1/5 m 3 solution tank) are compared, they have almost the same reliability of 99%, but the LCSs are quite different. For the system with large solar C/R area and smaller solution tank capacity, the LCS is HK$60,805, while for the system of smaller solar C/R area and larger solution tank the value is HK$70,119. Thus, increasing the solution capacity might be a better method to obtain higher system reliability. Fig. 14 shows the variation of the life cycle savings in the life cycle period. The payback period of the larger solution tank and smaller solar C/R area combination is almost 7 years, while the pay back period for the larger solar C/R area and smaller solution tank is a little more than 8 years. The payback period of the solar liquid desiccant air-conditioning system is a little longer than that of the common solar hot water system which is around 3\u20135 years, but much shorter than the payback period of solar photovoltaic systems. The economic feasibility of the solar desiccant air-conditioning system can be further improved by replacing the auxiliary electric heater with a gas boiler. 4 Conclusions In this article, a transient simulation model has been developed for the solar liquid desiccant dehumidification system. Together with the EnergyPlus, the model was used to study the energy performance and economic feasibility of a solar liquid desiccant dehumidification system integrated with a conventional vapor compression air-conditioning system for the weather conditions of Hong Kong. To increase the economic practicality of such a solar assisted air-conditioning system, the combined system utilizes solar energy and unsaturated ambient air for regenerating liquid desiccant solution. Besides, a simplified heat and mass transfer simulation model of the solar C/Rs is developed to study the hourly performance of the hybrid system for a case study. The capacity of the vapor compression subsystem in the solar assisted air-conditioning system can be reduced to 19 kW from original 28 kW. The economic performance of the solar desiccant dehumidification system is compared with a conventional air-conditioning system. The results show that the energy saving potentials of incorporating solar desiccant dehumidification system in conventional air-conditioning systems is significant for the Hong Kong weather conditions due to higher COP resulted from higher supply chilled water temperature from chillers. The annual operation energy savings for the hybrid system is 6760 kWh and the payback period of the hybrid system is around 7 years when the extra initial cost of the hybrid air-conditioning system is HK$6360. Considering the substantial annual energy savings and reasonable pay back period, the extra cost is acceptable.

        "abstract": "Steady natural convective airflow in a novel type glazing system with integrated semi-transparent photovoltaic (PV) cells has been analyzed numerically using a stream function vorticity formulation. Based on the resulting numerical predictions, the effects of Rayleigh numbers on airflow patterns and local heat transfer coefficients on vertical glazing surfaces were investigated for Rayleigh numbers in the range of 10 3 \u2264 Ra \u2264 2 \u00d7 10 5 . Significant agreement for the Nusselt numbers was observed between numerical simulation results in this study and those of earlier experimental and theoretical results available from the literature. In addition, the effect of air gap thickness in the cavity on the heat transfer through the cavity is evaluated. The optimum thickness of the air layer in this research is found to be in the range of 60\u201380 mm. This novel glazing system type could not only generate electricity but also achieve potential energy savings by reducing the air conditioning cooling load when applied in subtropical climatic conditions and simultaneously provide visual comfort in the indoor environment.

The application of a double-skin fa\u00e7ade can achieve energy savings through the reduction of air conditioning (A/C) energy consumptions. Natural lighting utilization and sound insulation can also be enhanced. A quiet and healthy working environment could thus be provided in a metropolitan city like Hong Kong. A new application of the glazing system is to integrate building facades with semi-transparent photovoltaic (PV) cells. These solar cells can, not only generate electricity, but also provide shade. The void between the two glass panes could serve as a thermal insulation layer and reduce the amount of energy consumed by the air-conditioning system in the building due to low conductivity of the air in the cavity. When the glazing is integrated with photovoltaic cells, an additional function of the building envelope is also created. This kind of solar energy applications is called building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). In this application, the windows are integrated with semi-transparent PV cells, which generates electricity as an energy source, thus contributing a dual function to the building envelope. Additional structural installation and maintenance cost could, therefore, be substantially reduced. Traditionally, windows play an important role in controlling heat transmission in indoor space during the summer period and external ambient heat loss during the winter period. In order to decrease solar transmission through windows, shading and blinds in the air cavities of the double-glazed window are, therefore, often employed. Avedissian and Naylor [1] investigated numerically, the free convective heat transfer in an enclosure with an internal louvered blind. The effect of Rayleigh numbers, enclosure aspect ratios, and blind geometry on the convective heat transfer, in this study is evaluated and compared with experimental results. Experimental results and other theoretical work related to heat transfer by natural convection or multi-mode heat transfer, for traditional double-skin facades, have been given by Todorovic and Cvjetkovic. [2] and Krishnan et\u00a0al. [3] . Gosselin and Chen [4] investigated heat transfer and airflow through a dual-airflow window. Yang and Zhu [5\u20137] extensively investigated natural convective heat transfer in both inclined channels and tall cavities. Laminar or turbulent natural convection heat transfer and transition of both flows were considered. This natural convective heat transfer in cavities has been of substantial interest owing to the practicality of its application, one example being the use of a double-skin fa\u00e7ade to reduce heating and cooling consumption, others include heat loss from flat-plate solar collectors and so on. In addition to the results from theoretical studies, many well-recorded data from experimental tests are also commonly available in the literature for validation of the theoretical mode for evaluation of the buoyant cavity flow [8] . As well as the use of blinds in the cavities of double-glazed windows for shade and thermal control, PV solar cells could be integrated with the glass to absorb solar radiation. Yang et\u00a0al. [9] theoretically investigated the energy performance of a PV wall and massive wall structure, and revealed that photovoltaic integration in building walls could reduce the cooling load by 33\u201350%. Fung and Yang [10] developed a one-dimensional transient heat transfer model to evaluate the heat gain of semi-transparent PV modules for BIPV applications. Related research work was conducted by Yang et\u00a0al. [11,12] . Fossa [13] investigated the physical mechanisms which influenced the thermal behavior of a double-skin photovoltaic (PV) fa\u00e7ade, and the experimental results showed that variation in the air gap width could decrease the glass surface temperature and thus enhance PV conversion efficiency. Fluid flow and heat transfer in the PV fa\u00e7ade cavities are considerably important in the evaluation of the energy performance and thermal behavior of the BIPV system. Various theoretical models and simulations of BIPV systems and double-skin fa\u00e7ades are found in the literature. Moshfegh and Sandberg [14] investigated fluid flow and heat transfer in a vertical channel heated from one side by PV elements. In their study, a two-dimensional finite element model was employed in a computational fluid dynamics study. Charron and Athienitis [15,16] presented a theoretical study of double-fa\u00e7ades with integrated PV and motorized blinds, analyzed various design parameters which affected the conversion of solar radiation, and investigated a two-dimensional model of a double-fa\u00e7ade with integrated photovoltaic panels. However, so far, no research has been conducted on the natural convective heat transfer in windows integrated with semi-transparent PV cells, in order to assess the local and average heat transfer coefficients. Determining the local and average heat transfer coefficients is important for estimating the amount of cooling load reduction and conversion efficiency improvement of the BIPV facade. To contribute further information on this issue, heat transfer through windows with semi-transparent PV, is investigated in this study. The various parameters affecting the local heat transfer coefficients on vertical glazing surfaces are also evaluated and based on simulation results, the optimum thermal thickness of the air layer is provided. 2 Problem description Incorporating energy efficiency or sustainable features in building construction design in urban areas could eventually help to reduce the reliance on fossil fuel resources which, in turn, could contribute to the reduction of the effect of global warming. A PV module integrated in a building fa\u00e7ade could generate electricity and substantially reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emissions from power stations. Fig.\u00a01 shows the building fa\u00e7ade in which the glazing is integrated with an amorphous solar cell. In this application, solar cells provide dual functions, i.e. they provide the building with both shading and electricity. The structure and geometry of the air cavity in the glazing system are illustrated in Fig.\u00a02 . No mechanical ventilation is provided for the air gap. Natural convective heat transfer in the cavity is investigated in this study to evaluate the thermal performance of the glazing system, integrated with PV cells. Illustrated in Fig.\u00a02 : are two vertical isothermal surfaces for different temperatures of T H and T C ( T H > T C ) during summer period. 3 Mathematical model 3.1 Governing equations for airflow in the cavity In this study, a mathematical model and computer code are developed to study the heat transfer by natural convection of air in the selected cavity. The airflow was assumed to be two-dimensional, incompressible laminar natural convection flow with constant fluid properties. The Boussinesq approximation was used to estimate the effect of the density variation. Viscous heat dissipation in the fluid was neglected. By elimination of pressure between two momentum equations, the stream function equation, vorticity transport equation and energy equation are obtained as follows.

The local and average Nusselt number for heated wall are given by (18) N u Y = \u2212 \u2202 \u0398 \u2202 X | X = 0 (19) Nu = 1 A \u222b 0 A N u Y \u2146 Y The heat flux through the double-glazed PV window is determined by (20) q = T out \u2212 T in ( 2 L g , o / k g ) + L g , in / k g + ( L PV / k PV ) + ( 1 / h ) + ( 1 / h o ) + ( 1 / h in ) where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient due to natural convection of the air in the gap, determined by (21) h = Nu k air L air T out is outdoor ambient temperature, T in is indoor design temperature, these temperatures are described in section 6.2; L PV is the thickness of the photovoltaic module, L PV = 2 mm; k PV is the conductivity of photovoltaic module, k PV = 237 W/m K; L g is the thickness of the glass sheet, L g,o = 4 mm and L g,in = 10 mm; h o and h in are outside and inside convective heat transfer coefficients respectively, which can be obtained from ASHRAE [17] . 4 Numerical methods The present investigation deals with numerical predictions of air flow and temperature distribution in a two-dimensional air cavity, which is isothermally heated from one side and cooled on the other side. The Navier\u2013Stokes equations and energy equation in terms of stream function and vorticity formulation are solved numerically by iterative finite difference technique. The governing equations are substituted by a set of algebraic equations, used in all grid points in the calculation domain being considered. To obtain a grid-independent solution, various grid dimensions were employed. Fig.\u00a03 shows the variation of the vertical velocity profile at mid-height for various grid sizes. It was found that a 36 \u00d7 36 grid size ensured the independence of solution on the grid with reasonable computation time. The computations are performed on Pentium(R) D CPU 3.40 GHz 3.39 GHz, 1.99 GB of RAM PC using a FORTRAN compiler. The set of resulting algebraic equations were solved iteratively and were performed by Successive Under-Relaxation (SUR) [18] . SUR is often employed to avoid divergence in the iterative solution of algebraic equations and to accelerate the convergence. Convergence of iteration for the solution is obtained until the values of the variables cease to change from the previous iteration to the next by less than the prescribed value. To examine whether the solution has converged, the following criterion is employed: (22) | \u03d5 n + 1 \u2212 \u03d5 n \u03d5 n + 1 | \u2264 \u025b where \u03d5 stands for \u03a8 , \u03a9 and \u0398 respectively, and n stands for the number of iterations. The value of \u025b is chosen as 10 \u22124 . 5 Validation of the model The present numerical results are evaluated for accuracy against numerical results published in previous works and experimental results reported by various authors. The comparisons of the average Nusselt numbers for laminar natural convective flow in an enclosure between the results from the present computer code and the published results are shown in Fig.\u00a04 . Significant agreement, which demonstrates the validity of the formulation and the computer code, is observed. The correlations between the average Nusselt numbers with other parameters, proposed by Yin et\u00a0al. [19] , are listed below: (23) Nu = 0.23 A \u2212 0.131 R a 0.269 for 10 3 \u2264 R a \u2264 5 \u00d7 10 6 and 4.9 \u2264 A \u2264 79.7 The correlations from Elsherbiny et\u00a0al. [20] are listed below: (24) N u 1 = 0.0605 \u00d7 R a 1 / 3 (25) N u 2 = [ 1 + { 0.104 R a 0.293 1 + ( 6310 / R a ) 1.36 } 3 ] 1 / 3 (26) N u 3 = 0.242 ( R a A ) 0.272 (27) Nu = max ( N u 1 , N u 2 , N u 3 ) for 5 \u2264 A \u2264 110, A = 20: Ra < 2 \u00d7 10 6 , A = 40: Ra < 2 \u00d7 10 5 , A = 80: Ra < 3 \u00d7 10 4 . 6 Results and discussion 6.1 Airflow in the cavity The temperature distribution and flow field of the buoyancy force induced natural convective airflow in the rectangular cavity, have been analyzed numerically for different Rayleigh numbers. Numerical results in terms of streamlines and isotherms are presented at various Rayleigh numbers. The numerical results, including the streamlines, temperature, local Nusselt number profiles and average Nusselt number for heated wall, are discussed respectively. Fig.\u00a05 shows the corresponding isotherm contours for different Rayleigh numbers in the range of 10 3 \u2264 Ra \u2264 10 5 . The results are illustrated for the aspect ratio of 8 and the end walls are assumed adiabatic. In the case of lower Rayleigh numbers, i.e. Ra = 10 3 , the dominant mode of heat transfer is observed by conduction, as shown in Fig.\u00a05 . The isotherms present nearly pure conduction characteristics, almost parallel to both the heated and cooled vertical surfaces. The isotherms are compressed to two vertical walls with the increase of the Rayleigh numbers. It can also be seen that warmer fluid becomes dominant in the rectangular cavity with an increase of the Rayleigh numbers when two thermal boundaries are gradually established. The temperature gradients in the x -direction at the bottom left and top right areas of the rectangular cavity are relatively large in comparison with the gradients near the top left and bottom right ends of the glass pane surfaces. Streamlines and vorticity contours for Pr = 0.7 and aspect ratio A = 8, presented in Figs. 6 and 7 , show the effect of various Rayleigh numbers on the buoyancy induced natural convective flow in the rectangular cavity for the Rayleigh number in the range of 10 3 \u2264 Ra \u2264 10 5 . Normally, aspect ratio in a general case will be quite larger than 8. In this study, an aspect ratio that equals to 8 has been chosen in order to show a complete flow pattern in the air cavity in a small scale. The streamlines and isotherms for Rayleigh number in the range of 1 \u2264 Ra \u2264 10 3 are neglected in this study because of the small variation in the flow patterns. This paper, therefore, presents the effect of Ra on flow patterns and heat transfer for Ra > 10 3 . The flow patterns have a significant effect on the rate of heat transfer. As shown in Fig.\u00a06 , streamline contours exhibit circulation patterns as the fluid motion is affected by both vertical heated and cooled glass panes. The direction of the flow, due to the thermal buoyancy force, is clockwise in this geometry and a single cell is observed in the cavity for all Rayleigh numbers. Fig.\u00a08 shows the variation of the local Nusselt number with the coordinate Y at the Raleigh number of 10 3 . In low Rayleigh ranges, the dominant mode of heat transfer is conduction, and small variations in both the airflow pattern and heat transfer are observed especially when the Rayleigh number is less than 10 3 . The\u00a0figure shows that the local Nusselt number decreases with the increase of the height of the cavity. Fig.\u00a09 shows the variation of the\u00a0local Nusselt number with coordinate X at the mid-height of the cavity for various Rayleigh numbers and A = 8. Fig.\u00a010 shows the vertical velocity profiles at mid-height for various Rayleigh numbers. It was found that the velocity increases with the increase of the Rayleigh numbers. 6.2 Optimization of the air layer The effect of the thickness of the air layer between two glass panes on the heat flux through the PV window was investigated for different temperature differences ( T out \u2212 T in ). In Hong Kong, the outdoor design temperatures for A/C systems are 32 \u00b0C for summer and 10 \u00b0C for winter. The indoor air temperature in a typical office in Hong Kong is supposed to be maintained, for energy savings, at 25 \u00b0C in summer and 22 \u00b0C in winter. Fig.\u00a011 shows the effect of the thickness of the air layer in relation to two temperature differences, i.e. 12 \u00b0C and 7 \u00b0C. It is indicated in the figure that heat transfer through the window can be considerably reduced by optimizing the thickness of the air layer. Heat flux through the window decreases considerably with the increase of the thickness of the air layer when L is less than 10 mm where heat transfer by conduction of the air gap is the dominant mode. The air layer in the window also served as additional thermal insulation. Heat transfer by convection of the air layer becomes pronounced with the increase of the thickness. In this circumstance, the change of heat transfer through the window will be balanced by the increase of conduction heat transfer and the decrease of convection heat transfer due to natural convection of the air in the cavity. The overall heat transfer decreases slightly when the thickness of the air layer is up to 60 mm. Therefore, the optimum thickness of the air layer could be chosen as 60\u201380 mm when energy saving due to less energy transport through the window is considered. 6.3 Power generation from the amorphous silicon cell A see-through a-Si solar cell was incorporated in the outer pane of the window for possible application in the office room fa\u00e7ade in Hong Kong. The novel type glazing system allows day lighting transmission and without sacrificing vision contact between the occupants and the outdoor environment simultaneously. This design has also been reported by various authors [21,22] . Over the past few years, according to reference [23,24] , a see-through a-Si solar cell has been used in windows and skylights by many Japanese architects. In Hong Kong, a ventilated solar window system was developed and analyzed by Chow et\u00a0al. [25] for possible application in warm climates. They claimed that in the warm climatic regions, the reversible mechanism is not required for the ventilated window. In their recent work [26] , a PV module is integrated in the window for cogeneration of electrical power and day lighting utilization. The I\u2013V characteristics of the see-through a-Si solar cell module have been measured in the Solar Simulation Laboratory of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Fig.\u00a012 shows the characteristic curves of the semi-transparent PV module under specified conditions (solar radiation intensity = 815 W/m 2 , measured temperature = 21 \u00b0C). Table 1 shows the technical data of the a-Si cell used in the glazing system. About half of the PV panel area is filled with thin film solar cells. The efficiency of the a-Si cell is approximately 6%, which is lower, compared with other types of solar cells, i.e. mono-silicon cell. However, it has a lower manufacturing cost and has little reliance on the Si as well as little effect on the environment. 7 Conclusions A numerical analysis of the steady buoyancy induced natural convective airflow in a cavity of a novel type see-through glazing system with integration of semi-transparent PV cells has been conducted in the study reported in this paper. Various factors affecting the local and average heat transfer coefficients along the vertical surfaces have been evaluated. It was found that the convective flow strength and heat transfer increased with the increase of the Rayleigh number. The numerical results have been compared with previous experimental results and other theoretical results available in the literature. Significant agreement was observed, thus validating the formulation and computer code, adopted by this study and presented in this paper. This study provides accurate heat transfer variables, necessary for predicting the PV conversion efficiency, when considering solar cell temperature in an investigation of the thermal behavior of building elements integrated with PV, such as a semi-transparent PV window. The effect of cavity air thickness on the overall heat transfer through the window has been evaluated, and the optimum thickness for the air layer was found to be in the range of 60\u201380 mm for the case study. Energy losses through the window could be reduced and additional power generation from the PV could also be obtained by applying the optimized semi-transparent PV window.

        "abstract": "This study presents a two-dimensional numerical analysis for thermal control strategies on potential energy savings in a double-pane window integrated with see-through a-Si photovoltaic (PV) cells with low-emittance (low-e) coatings. Both heat transmission through the air gap by combined convection and radiation, and air flow patterns within the cavity of the window were considered. The convection-conducting mechanisms in the cavity of the double-pane window have been closely investigated in this paper. Based on numerical predictions, the effect of Rayleigh number on airflow patterns was investigated for low Rayleigh numbers in the range of 10 3 \u2a7d Ra \u2a7d 10 5 . The effect of the low-e coatings on the glazing U -value was also explored in this paper. It was found that a large quantity of heat transfer by radiation could be reduced. This novel glazing system could help engineers\u2019 design in more advanced window systems with building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications in modern buildings.

When PV is integrated into the fa\u00e7ade of a building, especially integrated on window panes, less solar radiation is transmitted through the panels in comparison with conventional structures. This measure may make solar energy technologies application in buildings cost effective while improving aesthetic effects. PV panels may experience undesirably high temperatures due to part of the absorbed solar radiation that is not converted into electricity. This heat input can increase the cells\u2019 temperatures thus decreasing the conversion efficiency of solar cells. Open channel beneath the PV module are commonly used to extract the additional heat. There is a growing interest in studying heat and fluid flow in air gaps behind PV panels in order to maximize the utilization of the solar energy from the PV system. These previous works include Brinkworth et al. [1\u20134] , Mittelman et al. [5] , Tonui and Tripanagnostopoulos [6] as well as Ibrahim et al. [7] . Various models and investigations on BIPV systems and ventilated PV double fa\u00e7ades in the literature are commonly available. Moshfeg and Sandbergy [8] employed a 2D finite element model in a CFD study with idealized boundary conditions. Analytical expressions for the mass flow rate, velocity, temperature rise and location of neutral height in air gap behind solar cells located on vertical facades were derived by the same authors [9] . Dubey et al. [48] developed an analytical expression for electrical efficiency of PV module with and without flow as a function of climatic and design parameters. Mootz and Bezian [10] presented a 2D laminar flow model. Krauter et al. [11] presented the measurement results on active ventilation at conventional curtain PV facades and cooling by water flow. Infield et al. [12] , Mei et al. [13] and Yang et al. [14] proposed simplified methods to calculate the thermal performance of PV fa\u00e7ades. Natural ventilation effects of an air gap on a PV module\u2019s power output and heat transfer across a PV wall and PV-roof have been investigated by Yang et al. [15] . Charron and Athienitis [16,17] presented a theoretical study of double-facades with integrated PV and motorized blinds, analyzed various design parameters which affected the conversion of solar radiation, and investigated a two-dimensional model of a double-facade with integrated PV panels. Heat transfer in a building-integrated photovoltaic thermal system was studied by Liao et al. by using a two-dimensional CFD model [18] . Turbulent flow and convective heat transfer in the cavity, including buoyancy effect and long-wave radiation between boundary surfaces, were modeled. Bloem [19] extensively examined a PV-integrated building application in a well-controlled outdoor test environment. The results for a glass\u2013glass PV module with forced ventilation were presented. Over the past few years, according to references [20\u201323] , a see-through a-Si solar cell has been used in windows and skylights by many Japanese architects. Mercaldo et al. presented an analysis on architectural issues and technological developments of thin film silicon photovoltaics [47] . This is a promising application of BIPV system, which integrates the facade with semi-transparent PV cells. These kinds of cells do not only generate electricity but also provide shade. The void between the two layers of glasses is a path for natural convection of air. The air gap reduces the amount of energy consumed by the air-conditioning system in the building due to lower conductivity of infill air. Traditionally, windows play an important role in controlling heat transmission into indoor space during the summer period and external ambient heat loss during the winter period. In order to decrease solar transmission through windows, shading and blinds in the air cavities of the double-glazed window are, therefore, often employed. A low-e coating also reduces the radiative heat transfer. According to findings by Collins and Simoko [24] , employing a low-e coating on one or two glass surfaces within a vacuum gap of the vacuum glazing reduces radiative heat transfer across the glazing significantly. Zhang et al. [25] numerically analyzed the thermal insulation effect of a screen installed inside a vertical rectangular enclosure. The effect of the permeable screen on the temperature field, flow filed, and the overall heat transfer rate was determined numerically. Avedissian and Naylor [26] investigated numerically the free convective heat transfer in an enclosure with an internal louvered blind. The effects of Rayleigh number, enclosure aspect ratio, and blind geometry on the convective heat transfer were evaluated and compared with experimental results. Shahid and Naylor [27] examined the effect of the presence of venetian blind on the thermal performance of a window. Results show that the presence of a venetian blind improves the energy performance of a single and double-glazed window. Several early works in the literature related to their work are those of Machin et al. [28] and Phillips et al. [29] . For traditional double-skin facades, experimental results and other theoretical work related to heat transfer by natural convection or multi-mode heat transfer were reported by Todorovic and Cvjetkovic [30] as well as Krishnan et al. [31] . Gosselin and Chen [32] investigated heat transfer and airflow through a dual-airflow window. Aydin [33] analyzed numerically heat transfer through a double-pane window by a finite difference technique. Thermally optimum air layer thickness for different climates was determined. There are numerous studies in the literature regarding natural convection in simple-geometry enclosures with various boundary conditions. More complex boundary conditions were closely investigated by Oosthuizen [34,35] . Yang and Zhu [36\u201339] extensively investigated natural convective heat transfer in inclined, horizontal channels and vertical tall cavity. Laminar or turbulent natural convective heat transfer and transition of both flows were considered. This natural convective heat transfer in cavity has been substantially investigated due to its importance in the practical applications such as using double-skin fa\u00e7ades to reduce heating and cooling consumptions, solar collector et al. In Hong Kong, a ventilated solar window system was developed and extensively analyzed by Chow and his co-authors [40] for possible application in warm climates. They claimed that in warm climatic regions, a reversible mechanism is not required for a ventilated window. In a new design, a PV cell has been integrated in the window for cogeneration of electrical power and day lighting utilization [41] . Chow also conducted a comprehensive review on photovoltaic and thermal hybrid technologies [49] . Li et al. [42] conducted energy and cost analysis of semi-transparent PV cells in office buildings. Results indicated that an integrated system could reduce both artificial lighting and cooling energy consumptions. So far, to the authors\u2019 knowledge, there is few research conducted on the mixed convective and radiative heat transfer in double-pane window integrated with see-through a-Si PV cells and effect of low-e coating on U -value of the window. This paper presents a two-dimensional numerical analysis for thermal control strategies in a double-pane window. The mixed convective and radiative heat transfer in the air cavity and effect of low-e coating on the glazing U -value are also evaluated. 2 Problem description The current window system composes of two layers of highly transparent glass sheets, and thin film solar cells that are encapsulated in between the two glass sheets as depicted in Fig. 1 a. This advanced glazing system can produce electricity, and at the same time, daylight can penetrate through the window pane as shown in Fig. 1 b. 3 Mathematical model 3.1 Governing equations for airflow in the cavity The problem to be treated here is of natural convective flows in the cavity of a double-glazed window integrated with semi-transparent PV cells. It is a two-dimensional laminar incompressible flow except for the buoyancy effects where the Bousinesq approximation is applied to account for the buoyancy force driving the convective motion of the fluid, as described by Ghani et al. [46] . The governing equations for the fluid flow and heat transfer are listed as follows: (1) \u2202 u \u2202 x + \u2202 v \u2202 y = 0 (2) u \u2202 u \u2202 x + v \u2202 u \u2202 y = - 1 \u03c1 \u2202 p \u2202 x + \u03bd \u2202 2 u \u2202 x 2 + \u2202 2 u \u2202 y 2 (3) u \u2202 v \u2202 x + v \u2202 v \u2202 y = - 1 \u03c1 \u2202 p \u2202 y + \u03bd \u2202 2 v \u2202 x 2 + \u2202 2 v \u2202 y 2 + \u03b2 g ( T - T \u221e ) (4) u \u2202 T \u2202 x + v \u2202 T \u2202 y = k \u03c1 c p \u2202 2 T \u2202 x 2 + \u2202 2 T \u2202 y 2 Due to very low velocities involved the dissipation term has been neglected in the energy Eq. (4) . T \u221e is the temperature in the undisturbed fluid far from the surface. Where u and v are velocity component in the x and y coordinate direction, respectively. \u03bd is kinematic viscosity; \u03b2 is volumetric expansion coefficient; k is thermal conductivity; \u03c1 is density of fluid; c p is constant pressure specific heat; p is pressure. The boundary conditions on temperature on window surfaces on the solution are: On two vertical surfaces: (5) T = T H for hot surface; (6) T = T C for cold surface. On two horizontal surfaces: (7) \u2202 T \u2202 y = 0 The above equations can be written in terms of the stream function, \u03c8 , and the vorticity, \u03c9 defined as (8) u = \u2202 \u03c8 \u2202 y , v = - \u2202 \u03c8 \u2202 x (9) \u03c9 = \u2202 v \u2202 x - \u2202 u \u2202 y In terms of the stream function, \u03c8 , the momentum equation, continuity equation and energy equation become: (10) \u2202 2 \u03c8 \u2202 x 2 + \u2202 2 \u03c8 \u2202 y 2 = - \u03c9 (11) \u2202 \u03c8 \u2202 y \u2202 \u03c9 \u2202 x - \u2202 \u03c8 \u2202 x \u2202 \u03c9 \u2202 y = \u03bd \u2202 2 \u03c9 \u2202 x 2 + \u2202 2 \u03c9 \u2202 y 2 - \u03b2 g \u2202 T \u2202 x (12) \u2202 \u03c8 \u2202 y \u2202 T \u2202 x - \u2202 \u03c8 \u2202 x \u2202 T \u2202 y = \u03b1 \u2202 2 T \u2202 x 2 + \u2202 2 T \u2202 y 2 For the boundary conditions, the temperatures of the two vertical walls are assumed to be uniform maintaining the respective temperature T H and T c of these surfaces ( T H > T c ) constant, and the bottom wall and top wall are adiabatic, as shown in Fig. 2 , so that (13) \u2202 \u03c8 \u2202 x = \u2202 \u03c8 \u2202 y = 0 (14) \u2202 T \u2202 y = 0 at y = 0 , y = H , (15) T = T H , T = T C at x = 0 , x = L In order to reduce the number of variables, the above equations were written in the form of dimensionless variables. The following non-dimensional variables are defined as (16) \u03a8 = \u03c8 Pr \u03bd , \u03a9 = \u03c9 L 2 Pr \u03bd (17) X = x L , Y = y L (18) \u0398 = T - T C T H - T C In terms of dimensionless variables, Eqs. (10)\u2013(18) become: (19) \u2202 2 \u03a8 \u2202 X 2 + \u2202 2 \u03a8 \u2202 Y 2 = - \u03a9 (20) \u2202 2 \u03a9 \u2202 X 2 + \u2202 2 \u03a9 \u2202 Y 2 = 1 Pr \u2202 \u03a8 \u2202 Y \u2202 \u03a9 \u2202 X - \u2202 \u03a8 \u2202 X \u2202 \u03a9 \u2202 Y + Ra \u2202 \u0398 \u2202 X (21) \u2202 2 \u0398 \u2202 X 2 + \u2202 2 \u0398 \u2202 Y 2 = \u2202 \u03a8 \u2202 Y \u2202 \u0398 \u2202 X - \u2202 \u03a8 \u2202 X \u2202 \u0398 \u2202 Y The boundary conditions in terms of dimensionless variables as (22) \u03a8 = 0 (23) \u2202 \u0398 \u2202 Y = 0 at Y = 0 , Y = A , (24) \u0398 = 1 , \u0398 = 0 at X = 0 , X = 1 where A = H / L is the aspect ratio of the enclosure. When radiation heat transfer is considered, the boundary conditions for two horizontal surfaces are as follows according to Ridouane et al. [50] : (25) \u2202 T \u2202 x + N r Q r = 0 where Q r denotes the dimensionless net radiative heat flux at two horizontal adiabatic walls. The dimensionless radiosity equation for the i th element on each wall is determined as (26) G i = ( 1 - \u03b5 i ) \u2211 S j F ij G j + \u03b5 i T i \u0398 + 1 4 The dimensionless radiant heat flux is calculated as (27) Q r = \u03b5 i 1 + T i \u0398 4 - \u2211 j F ij G j where F ij represents view factor between segments i and j ; G j represents dimensionless radiosity of segment i ; \u025b i represents surface emissivity of the i th element. 3.2 Thermal transmission of double-pane window The thermal transmittance, U -value, for double-pane window could be obtained by using the procedure described in BS 6993 (British Standards Institution, 1989) [43] , reader could also refer to ISO and EN standards for the calculations. The thermal transmittance of the glazing is obtained by the following equation: (28) U = 1 1 h out + 1 h t + 1 h in where h out and h in are exterior and interior heat transfer coefficients, which can be obtained from ASHRAE [44] . h t is the conductance of double-pane window unit. (29) 1 h t = \u2211 N 1 h s + L g r g + L PV r PV where h s is the air cavity heat transfer coefficient, N is number of window cavities, L g and L PV are total thickness of glass panes and PV cells, r g and r PV are thermal resistivity of glass and PV cells. The air cavity heat transfer coefficient h s for combined mode of radiation and convection heat transfer is determined by convective heat transfer h c and radiation heat transfer coefficients h r . Air cavity heat transfer coefficient is determined as follows: (30) h s = h c + h r where h c is infill air convective heat transfer coefficient, h r is radiation heat transfer coefficient, which can be determined by the approximate expression (31) h r = 4 \u03c3 1 \u03b5 out + 1 \u03b5 in - 1 - 1 T m 3 where \u03c3 is the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann\u2019s constant, \u03b5 out is the emmitance of outer glass pane, \u03b5 in is emmitance of the inner glass pane and T m is absolute temperature corresponding to the average mean pane temperature. The convective heat transfer coefficient due to natural ventilation of the air in the gap is determined by (32) Nu Y = - \u2202 \u0398 \u2202 X X = 0 (33) Nu \u00af = 1 A \u222b 0 A Nu Y dY (34) h c = Nu \u00af k air L air The parameters used in this study are summarized in Table 1 . 4 Numerical method To solve the above mathematical model, finite difference method was used. The present investigation deals with numerical prediction of air flow and temperature distribution in a two-dimensional double-glazed window cavity, which is isothermally heated from one side and cooled on the other side. The Navier\u2013Stokes equations and energy equation in terms of the stream function and vorticity formulation are solved numerically. To obtain a grid-independent solution, various grid dimensions were employed. A moderate grid size with reasonable calculation time is adopted in the study. The stream function equations are solved by successive under-relaxation (SUR) [45] . The set of resulting algebraic equations are solved iteratively and an algorithm of solution based upon a Fortran 90 compiler is implemented. Convergence of iteration for the solution is obtained until the values of the variables cease to change from previous iteration to the next by less than the prescribed value. To examine whether the solution is steady, the following criterion is employed: (35) MAX | ( \u03d5 iter + 1 - \u03d5 iter ) / \u03d5 iter + 1 | \u2a7d \u03c2 where \u03c6 denotes \u03a8 , \u03a9 and \u0398 respectively, and iter and iter + 1 denote successive iterations. The value of \u03b6 is chosen as 10 \u22124 . 5 Results and discussion 5.1 Air flow in the cavity The temperature distribution and flow field of the buoyancy forces induced natural convective airflow in the rectangular cavity and has been analyzed numerically for different Rayleigh numbers in the first part of the study. The flow and temperature fields and heat transfer results were obtained for Pr = 0.7 and Ra ranging from 10 3 to 10 5 . Numerical results in terms of stream lines and isotherms are presented at various Rayleigh numbers. The numerical results, including the streamlines, and temperature values, are discussed respectively. Fig. 3 shows the corresponding isotherm contours for different Rayleigh numbers in the range of 10 3 \u2a7d Ra \u2a7d 10 5 . The results are illustrated for the aspect ratio of 10 and the end walls are assumed adiabatic. In the case of lower Rayleigh number, i.e. Ra = 10 3 , the dominant mode of heat transfer is observed by conduction, as shown in Fig. 3 . The isotherms present nearly pure conduction characteristics, almost parallel to both the heated and cooled vertical surfaces. The isotherms are compressed to the two vertical walls with the increase of the Rayleigh numbers. The temperature gradients in the x -direction at bottom left and top right areas of the rectangular cavity are relatively large in comparison with the gradients near the top left and bottom right ends of the glass pane surfaces. Streamlines for Pr = 0.7 and aspect ratio A = 10, presented in Fig. 4 show the effect of various Rayleigh numbers on the buoyancy induced natural convective flow in the rectangular cavity for the Rayleigh number in the range of 10 3 \u2a7d Ra \u2a7d 10 5 . The streamlines and isothermal for Rayleigh number, Ra, in the range of 1 \u2a7d Ra \u2a7d 10 3 are neglected in this study considering the small variation in the flow patterns. Therefore, this paper presents the effect of Ra on flow patterns and heat transfer for Ra > 10 3 . The flow patterns have a significant effect on the rate of heat transfer. As shown in Fig. 4 , streamline contours exhibit circulation patterns as the motion of fluid is affected by both vertical heated and cooled glass panes. The direction of the flow due to the thermal buoyancy force is clockwise in this geometry and a single cell is observed in the cavity for all Rayleigh numbers. The solutions for stream function \u03c8 and velocity vectors are shown in Fig. 5 . Combined effect of surface radiation and convection of heat transfer modes are considered simultaneously. Two real climate data used for determination of boundary condition are employed. Convective heat transfer at out pane and heat transfer by conduction at solid part are considered for determining the surface temperatures of the glass pane, and subsequently use the temperature as the boundary condition for the air flow simulation. The maximum stream function \u03c8 , for case I with outdoor air temperature T out = 42 \u00b0C, is \u03c8 max = 1.925 \u00d7 10 \u22124 m 2 /s, for case II with outdoor air temperature T out = 38 \u00b0C, is \u03c8 max = 5.835 \u00d7 10 \u22122 m 2 /s. Fig. 5 a shows one single cell structure, and (b) shows three cell structures for the visual examination of the flow field. The air temperature in the cavity along the window height as a function of Y is shown in Fig. 6 for various Rayleigh numbers. The non-dimensional temperature, \u0398 , is linear. Higher value of non-dimensional temperature, \u0398 , indicate higher air temperature according to the definition of the non-dimensional temperature in Eq. (18) . 5.2 Effect of low-e coating on the U -value of glazing units Low-e coating has significant influence on glazing U -value. Substantial amount of the long-wave radiation could be reflected by employing a low-e coating either on one glass surface or both surfaces bounding the air gap of window units. Fig. 7 shows the effect of the increase in the emissivity of two surfaces bounding the air gap on the glazing U -value. In the figure, one low-e coating refers to PV glass with low-e coating and its opposite glass surface uncoated. Two low-e coatings refer to two surfaces bounding the air gap where both are low-e coated. In general, the effective emissivity ranges from 0.05 to 0.12 for low-e coatings, and for uncoated float glass the emissivity \u03b5 is 0.88 in this study. In air cavity of a double-pane window with uncoated surfaces, the long-wave radiation exchange between glass surfaces is larger than the case with low-e coatings, thus the glazing U -value could be substantially reduced. 6 Conclusions Numerical solutions to the Navier\u2013Stokes and energy equations for laminar natural convection in the air cavity of a double-pane window system with integrated see-through PV glass with low-e coating have been obtained for Rayleigh numbers ranging from 10 3 to 10 5 . It was found that the convective flow strength and heat transfer increase with the increase of Rayleigh number. This study provides accurate heat transfer variables which are necessary for predicting the PV conversion efficiency considering solar cell temperature and investigating the thermal behaviors of building elements integrated with PV, i.e. see-through PV double-pane window. The effect of PV glass with low-e coating as thermal control strategy on the heat transmittance, U -value, is also explored. Results indicate that a large quantity of heat transfer by radiation within the air cavity could be reduced by employing PV double-pane window with low-e coating.

        "abstract": "Ventilated building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) facades can not only generate electricity at the locations of buildings themselves but if designed optimally, such facades can also reduce the respective heat gains and heat losses in summer and winter via the building envelope. The development of a novel ventilated BIPV double-skin facade (DSF), constituted by a see-through amorphous silicon (a-Si) PV module and an inward opening window, is reported in this paper. In order to enhance ventilation, an air-flow duct, 400 mm in depth is situated between the outside PV module and the inside window. This ventilation design can remove much of the waste heat generated by the PV module energy conversion processes, and thus bring down the operating temperature of the solar cells. Infrared thermal imaging was adopted in relation to the ventilated PV-DSF to visually demonstrate this ventilating effect. It was found that the air temperature at the outlet louver is higher than that at the inlet louver by 2.2\u20132.3 \u00b0C. The thermal performance of PV-DSFs operating in different modes was studied and compared. The results showed that the ventilated PV-DSF provides the lowest solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC), while the non-ventilated PV-DSF better reduces heat loss. Based on the experimental results, the optimum operation strategy for the PV-DSF under different weather conditions has been determined and proposed. This novel PV-DSF is more suitable for sub-tropical climates because it results in a much lower SHGC than that of a low-e coating DSF.",

        "abstract": "A comprehensive simulation model has been developed in this paper to simulate the overall energy performance of an amorphous silicon (a-Si) based photovoltaic double-skin facade (PV-DSF). The methodology and the model simulation procedure are presented in detail. To simulate the overall energy performance, the airflow network model, daylighting model, and the Sandia Array Performance Model in the EnergyPlus software were adopted to simultaneously simulate the thermal, daylighting, and dynamic power output performances of the PV-DSF. The interaction effects between thermal, daylighting, and the power output performances of the PV-DSF were reasonably well modeled by coupling the energy generation, heat-transfer, and optical models. Simulation results were compared with measured data from an outdoor test facility in Hong Kong in which the PV-DSF performance was measured. The model validation work showed that most of the simulated results agreed very well with the measured data except for a modest overestimation of heat gains in the afternoons. In particular, the root-mean-square error between the simulated monthly AC energy output and the measured quantity was only 2.47%. The validation results indicate that the simulation model developed in this study can accurately simulate the overall energy performance of the semi-transparent PV-DSF. This model can, therefore, be an effective tool for carrying out optimum design and sensitivity analyses for PV-DSFs in different climate zones. The methodology developed in this paper also provides a useful reference and starting point for the modeling of other kinds of semi-transparent thin-film PV windows or facades.

The hourly weather data as simulation input is a crucial factor for the successful energy system simulation, and obtaining an accurate set of weather data is necessary to represent the long-term typical weather conditions throughout a year. This paper introduces a stochastic approach, which is called the first order multivariate Markov chain model, to generate the annual weather data for better evaluating and sizing different energy systems. The process for generating the weather data time series from the multivariate Markov transition probability matrices is described using 15-years actual hourly weather data of Hong Kong. The ability of this new model for retaining the statistical properties of the generated weather data series is examined and compared with the current existing TMY and TRY data. The main statistical properties used for this purpose are mean value, standard deviation, maximum value, minimum value, frequency distribution probability and persistency probability of the weather data sequence. The comparison between the observed weather data and the synthetically generated ones shows that the statistical characteristics of the developed set of weather data are satisfactorily preserved and the developed set of weather data can predict and evaluate different energy systems more accurately.",

Three kinds of ZrO2 beads with diameter of 2, 1, and 0.1\u20130.2\u00a0mm were utilized to investigate their influence on the grinding and dispersion of the commercial TiO2 powder in the ball mill. From the SEM images, surface profiler and transmittance spectrum it could be demonstrated that the smallest ZrO2 bead with the diameter of 0.1\u20130.2\u00a0mm was the best candidate to disperse the TiO2 powder into nanoscale size to make the high dispersed TiO2 paste which was the key factor to achieve a smooth, high transparent TiO2 coating. The surface wettability measurement showed that all the screen-printed coatings had super hydrophilic surfaces, which was independent to the surface morphology. However, the coating with the highest transparency showed the lowest photocatalytic activity which is mainly due to the light loss.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Semi-transparent photovoltaic (STPV) windows, which can not only generate electricity in situ, but also effectively reduce solar heat gain while utilizing natural daylight, have gained increasing popularity due to their energy and environmental benefits. However, the poor thermal insulation performance of single-glazed STPV windows has restricted their application in cold climate regions. PV insulated glass unit (IGU) is an alternative for STPV window applications. This paper presents a comprehensive assessment on overall energy performance of PV-IGUs with different PV glazing transmittance and rear glasses in comparison with conventional IGUs in five different climate zones in China. The results show that PV-IGUs can achieve energy savings in all the representative cities. The largest energy savings are observed in Kunming where heating and cooling demands are low but annual solar radiation level is high. In cold climate regions like Harbin, the PV-IGU with higher transmittance and rear low-e glass consumes less net source energy in comparison with that with lower transmittance and rear clear glass. Although the lighting energy demand of PV-IGU is larger than conventional IGU, the daylight quality of the room with PV-IGU is better due to the higher useful daylight illuminance (UDI) and lower daylight glare probability (DGP).",

Combined with the measured optical and electrical characteristics of the PV laminate, an integrated model was developed to simulate the overall energy performance of the PV IGU in EnergyPlus. Outdoor experiments were conducted to validate the accuracy of the simulation model. The proper consistency between the simulation results and the experimental data indicated that the simulation model was reliable for predicting the overall energy performance of PV IGU. With the validated model, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate the influences of air gap depth and rear side glass, and an optimal design scheme was proposed to maximize the energy efficiency of PV IGU in Hong Kong. Finally, the energy saving potential of the optimized PV IGU compared to the other commonly used window systems was evaluated. It was found that the energy saving potential of the optimized PV IGU was 25.3% and 10.7%, respectively, compared to the single clear glass window and the Low-E glass window.

The velocity deficit predicted by the newly-developed Jensen\u2013Gaussian wake model is compared with wind tunnel experimental measured data in literatures and results show that, the velocity deficit predicted by the model fits well with the measured data at different downwind distances of X=2.5D, X=5D, X=7.5D and X=10D. Considering the turbulence inside the turbine wake, a new turbulence model is developed and based on this, the Jensen\u2013Gaussian wake model was improved and validated. The 2D Jensen\u2013Gaussian wake model is then applied in the wind turbine layout optimizing process within a wind farm based on the multiple populations genetic algorithm (MPGA). The performance of this newly 2D model in the optimization process is validated and compared with the results presented in some typical studies on the turbine layout optimization. The comparison is performed for \u2018constant wind speed of 12m/s with variable wind directions\u2019. Using the 2D Jensen\u2013Gaussian wake model instead of Jensen\u2019s wake model in the MPGA turbine layout optimization program, both the total power generation and wind farm efficiency decreased. The wind farm efficiency drop to 77.83%, 78.47% and 81.84% from 96.83%, 96.34% and 96.23% for 38, 39 and 40 wind turbines, respectively which is in accordance with the literatures on the power losses caused by wake effect in large wind farm.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Cooling system represents a growing market in buildings worldwide, with a particularly significant growth rate observed in commercial buildings. Solar driven cooling system can be a promising alternative to traditional electrical cooling system. It can be used in combination with solar thermal collectors or photovoltaic collectors to release the duty caused by electrical cooling system. In this study, the performance of three different solar cooling systems is examined, namely: 1) a solar electrical, 2) a solar thermal and 3) a traditional electrical cooling system. The first system employs photovoltaic module to drive a conventional electrical chiller. The second system uses solar thermal collectors to drive a heat driven adsorption chiller and the third one utilizes the grid power to feed the electrical chiller. Assessment of life-cycle costs of these three systems are conducted to verify the best option for buildings. A case study in Hong Kong is conducted to assess the three cooling systems.",

It investigates the spatial distribution of cloud coverage through geostationary satellites from the Multi-functional Transport Satellite (MTSAT). The results indicate that a non-prominent spatial variation of cloud cover presides over a majority of Hong Kong territories. Appropriate locations for deploying solar PV panels, such as rooftops, were delineated using RS, GIS, and existing ancillary data. Extraction and filtering of pixels based on a set of criterions were used to identify optimal PV rooftops. This study shows that the summarization of PV potentials in Hong Kong is 2.66 TWh on building rooftops. The methodologies and findings from this study permits detailed spatial estimation of city-wide solar energy potential, and assists the policy-decision process on the use of renewable energy in Hong Kong.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Solar spectrum plays an important role on electrical performance of PV modules via affecting their short circuit current. In this study, a new model combining the impacts of both air mass and diffuse solar radiation ratio is developed to evaluate the solar spectrum impacts on the short circuit current of photovoltaic (PV) modules. A new method, named air mass cumulative distribution function method (AMCDF), is introduced to represent the relationship between air mass and solar spectrum effect. The experimental data shows that when air mass is less than 4.5, the relationship between the normalized short-circuit current and the air mass cumulative distribution function can be well represented by a five-order polynomial. However, when air mass is larger than 4.5, the relationship becomes irregular. Further study on the irregular data indicates that the chaotic relationship is caused by the impact of diffuse solar radiation ratio (R d ). Based on these findings, the new model which combines the air mass cumulative distribution function and the diffuse solar radiation ratio is developed to evaluate the spectrum effect. Compared to conventional models, the proposed model has higher prediction accuracy and it also can predict short circuit current even when the air mass is high.",

        "abstract": "The wind energy utilization in Hong Kong is limited, although its potential has proven to be significant. The lack of effective policy for wind energy development is the main constraint. In this paper, the wind power potential in Hong Kong is analyzed, and the wind power potential assessment is conducted based on one-year field measured wind data using Light Detection u0026 Ranging (LiDAR) technology in a proposed offshore wind farm. Results show that the offshore wind power potential in Hong Kong was 14,449 GWh which occupied 32.20% of electricity consumption in 2017. In addition, the electricity market and power structure in Hong Kong are also reviewed with the existing policies related to renewable energy development. Conclusions can be made that the renewable energy target in Hong Kong is out of date and until now there have been no specific effective policies on wind energy. In order to urge Hong Kong, catch up with other countries/regions on wind energy development, the histories and evolution of wind energy policies in other countries, especially in Denmark, are reviewed and discussed. Suggestions are provided in the aspects of economics, public attitude, and political factors which can stimulate wind power development in Hong Kong.",

        "abstract": "This paper studied the annual thermal performance of a photovoltaic wall (PV wall) mounted on a multi-layer fa\u00e7ade. Based on some developed unsteady-state heat transfer models for a PV wall and a normal wall, the annual thermal performance of two types of walls was simulated. Compared with a normal wall, the south-facing PV wall could reduce heat gain through the envelope by 51% in summer under Hong Kong weather conditions. The impact of the PV wall on the envelope's heat gain and heat loss in winter was investigated for the first time, and the results indicated that the PV wall could not only significantly reduce the heat gain through the envelope in daytime, but also reduce the heat loss at nighttime. The heat gain and heat loss through the PV wall in winter were reduced by 69% and 32% respectively compared with a normal wall. Totally, an annual thermal energy consumption reduction of 52.1. kW. h was achieved by replacing each square meter of a south-facing normal wall by a PV wall, which is equivalent to a saving of 18.6. kW. h of electric energy for the air conditioning system in a building. The impact of the thickness of an air duct on the thermal performance of the PV wall was also discussed. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

Based on the forerunners\u2019 successful PV industry experiences and Hong Kong\u2019s unique local situations, a series of incentive strategies were proposed for Hong Kong to help promote the utilization of solar PV systems by reducing the initial investment and providing reasonable subsidies at the initial stages and during the operation period of the PV systems.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Semi-transparent photovoltaic (STPV) windows, which can not only admit daylight into space but also generate electricity, have been widely used as a part of building components in recent years. This paper compares the overall energy performance between STPV windows and commonly used energy-efficient windows, viz. double-pane and Low-E windows, in Hong Kong. A new type of see-through amorphous silicon (a-Si) photovoltaic (PV) module was adopted, and this PV module has higher efficiency compared with other commercialized a-Si PV modules with the same visible transmittance. First, a series of testing were carried out to get the technical parameters of this PV module. Second, the simulation models were developed theoretically, and power, thermal and daylighting performance of different windows were analyzed by EnergyPlus accordingly together with the input weather data of typical meteorological year (TMY) in Hong Kong. Then, based on the simulated energy uses of the air-conditioning and the artificial lighting of the room, as well as the power generation of the STPV windows themselves, the overall energy performance was evaluated. The results indicate that STPV glazing can save up to 18% and 16% total electricity per year respectively in comparison with the clear single and double-pane glazings in cooling dominated areas like Hong Kong. The overall energy performance of Low-E glazing and STPV glazing is very close to each other, which means that STPV glazing is quite energy-efficient. In Hong Kong, southwest is the best orientation for power generation for STPV windows and south is the optimum orientation for STPV window installation in terms of achieving the best overall energy performance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Solar photovoltaic (PV) modules can not only generate electricity but also act as external shading devices of buildings. Solar PV shadings can effectively reduce the solar heat gain through windows, but might have a negative impact on the indoor daylight performance. Therefore, it is worth investigating the optimum design of solar PV shadings since the thermal, daylighting and power generation performance are closely integrated. In this paper, a numerical simulation model was utilized on the basis of EnergyPlus to investigate the energy saving potential of solar PV shadings with various tilt angles and orientations in Hong Kong. The results indicate that the optimum installation position for solar PV shadings is south facade with 30\u00b0 tilt angle in order to maximize the electricity generation. However, considering the electricity savings from air-conditioning system and the increased electricity consumption for artificial lighting, it is recommended that solar PV shadings should be installed on a south facade with 20\u00b0 tilt angle. Furthermore, the annual overall electricity benefits of solar PV shadings were compared with the widely used interior blinds. The results show that the well-designed solar PV shadings can achieve much more annual overall electricity benefits than interior blinds.",

However, vacuum glazing, which has excellent thermal insulation, can effectively solve the above issues for PV windows. In order to take advantage of excellent thermal insulation performance of vacuum glazing, a novel vacuum photovoltaic insulated glass unit (VPV IGU) was presented. The electrical characteristics of the PV laminated glass were tested in laboratory under standard test conditions. Then power generation and thermal performances of the VPV IGU were evaluated through experiments.

Therefore, in cooling dominated areas, the principal of window design includes both utilizing natural daylight and eliminating solar heat gain. In this study, a new heat insulated coating combined antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO) and cesium tungsten bronze (Cs 0.33 WO 3 ) was developed. Based on measured properties of different glass samples, thermal and daylighting performance of different glass windows, including a clear glass window, a double-layer glass window, a low-e glass window and a coated glass window, were evaluated based on numerical simulation. Results indicate that the developed heat insulated coating can effectively reduce the solar heat gain while maintain the indoor daylighting illuminance at a high level. Up to 9.5% of building energy use can be saved if the coating is applied to south facing clear glass windows.",

From the FESEM, it was demonstrated that the silver nanoparticles were high-dispersive and spherical in shape.

        "abstract": "Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) have become a promising technology due to the urgent demand for sustainable energy supplies. Effective thermal regulation of BIPV is of great importance because the undesirable heat produced by photovoltaic (PV) modules will not only decrease the energy conversion efficiency, but also increase the building cooling load. The photovoltaic double skin facade (PV-DSF), regarded as one of the most feasible approaches to mitigate these problems, has been widely adopted and constructed globally. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on PV-DSFs in terms of both energy performance and heat transfer characteristics. The energy performance of PV-DSFs involves a combination of energy supply from PV systems and energy demand for indoor heating, cooling and lighting. Investigations on the air flow and heat transfer characteristics in PV-DSFs are essential for understanding the heat transfer mechanisms and optimizing the system configurations. Based on the literature review, an outlook for future research is provided. This review article is expected to serve as a useful reference for future research and development of the PV-DSF technology.",

Thus, it can be used to block the solar radiative heat transfer in a building. The primary particle size of ATO/TiO 2  composites detected by TEM ranges from 5 to 12\u00a0nm, but that of the initial ATO nano particles is more than 2\u00a0\u00b5m. A small amount of TiO 2  (16.7% wt) increases the Zeta potential in water from 6.7 to 37.01\u00a0mV, which represents the stability is largely enhanced. The IR transmittance in IR band is decreased from 91% (original glass) to 4.3% (ATO 83.33% wt). The thermal performances of glass with such coatings are simulated based on Hong Kong climate situation. For the best sample, the electricity used in air-conditioning and lighting is 27% less than uncoated glass. Furthermore, the TiO 2  makes the water contact angle of the coating ranging from 3 to 5.6\u00b0. Therefore, the coating film can be prevented from fouling due to super-hydrophilicity and have a longer life time.",

        "abstract": "Renewable energy based power generation system holds the most promising solution for remote area power supply. In this study, the long term operation performance of a 19.8kWp standalone solar photovoltaic (SAPV) system in a remote island is investigated. The methodology for evaluating system performance is introduced, and then the detailed assessment results are presented, accompanying with analysis and discussion. Results show that the photovoltaic (PV) array operated well with AC power generation efficiency of about 10% and overall system efficiency is about 7.7%. The reference yield, array yield and final yield are 4.08, 3.05, and 2.45kWh/kWp/day, respectively, therefore the resultant performance ratio is 60%, demonstrating that the performance of SAPV plant is satisfactory during the reporting period. However, after long term performance monitoring and analysis, the limitation of SAPV system begins to arise due to lack of grid management and compensations from other energy sources, suggesting that it would be better to develop or integrate it into a microgrid system with hybrid sources if possible.",

In this work, a complete process for preparation of waveband two-component transparent NIR shielding (WTNS) coatings combined ATO (antimony doped tin oxide) and Cs0.33WO3 nanomaterials is proposed. ATO and Cs0.33WO3 were synthesized by controllable hydrothermal methods and dispersed by a ball mill with silane coupling agents. The transmittance spectra demonstrate that WTNS coated glass shows excellent NIR shielding performance in a wide-band wavelength from 780 nm to 2500 nm, which could shield the NIR light as much as 90.9% and retain high transparency in the visible light of 70.6%. The overall energy performance assessment of this NIR shielding coatings was obtained, which includes thermal chamber test and software simulation in EnergyPlus. The chamber tests reveal the superior thermal insulation ability of WTNS coatings. The simulations indicate that for the area like Hong Kong which is cooling dominated areas, WTNS coated glass has the best energy performance which can significantly save up to 15.22% and 9.15% electricity per year in comparison with the normal glass and low-e glass, respectively.",

However, the unsteady interfacial information, including the interfacial pressure, velocity and film thickness, is hardly to be examined accurately by theoretical prediction or experimental measurement due to its complexity. In this study, CFD (computational fluid dynamic) models for the counter-current flow of the LDD were established based on the VOF (volume of fraction) and RNG (Renormalization group) k-e turbulence model. Experimental research had been conducted to validate the liquid film thickness and typical interfacial waves obtained in simulation. With the established model, the dynamic formation process of unsteady counter-current flow is evaluated. Moreover, the effects of various parameters on the liquid film waves, pressure drop, liquid film thickness and interfacial information were obtained and analyzed by the built models. With the increase of liquid flow rate, the roll waves appear and the wave amplitudes are increased significantly, which may obviously enhance the performance in the LDD absorption and regeneration process due to the increased contact area.",

The packing type plays a significant role in the system performance, but comparative studies of the different types are limited. First, this article investigates the dehumidification performance of liquid desiccant dehumidification with three packing types: corrugated structured, S-shaped polyvinyl chloride, and globular-shaped polypropylene. Then, the operation performance of solar-assisted liquid desiccant air-conditioning systems with different packings is simulated. A commercial building in Hong Kong was chosen as the case study. Results show that each specific packing surface area and structure determines the dehumidification performance by significantly influencing the liquid/air contact area and time. The enthalpy and moisture effectiveness of the corrugated structured packing were found to be 1.69 and 1.60\u00a0times those of ...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Moisture affects building materials, the thermal comfort of building occupants and the work performed by them. The plate liquid desiccant air-conditioning system (LDACS) is a promising dehumidification alternative to traditional air-conditioning system for lower energy consumption and less pollution. The shrinkage of the falling film on working plates critically influences the dehumidification performance by affecting the wetting area and film thickness. This paper developed a new model of plate dehumidifier concerning the shrinkage shape and the variable film thickness of falling film. The new model was validated by experiments and compared with existing models. The results indicated that the effect of contact angles on dehumidification performance can be accurately predicted. The moisture removal rates increased rapidly from 2.0\u00a0g/kg to 2.56\u00a0g/kg as the contact angles decreased from 85\u00b0 to 5\u00b0, while the wetting area increased from 0.145\u00a0m 2  to 0.176\u00a0m 2 . The distribution of the humidity ratio of process air along flow direction with different contact angles was also simulated. Besides, the average film thickness decreased from 0.952\u00a0mm to 0.889\u00a0mm as the contact angles decreased from 85\u00b0 to 5\u00b0. The annual electricity consumption of plate LDACS with different contact angles for a typical building in Hong Kong was estimated and analysed by using the newly developed model. The new model can achieve a better predictive accuracy by considering the exact shrinkage shape of falling film and the findings can provide a new insights improving the performance of plate dehumidifiers and other industrial applications, such as vertical condensers, evaporators and absorption towers.",

Surface properties of dehumidifiers critically influence the dehumidification performance. Therefore, this paper aims at investigating the influence of surface properties on dehumidification performance of falling film dehumidifiers. Three commonly-used plate dehumidifiers, i.e., Stainless steel plate dehumidifier, Titanium plate dehumidifier and Polytetrafluoroethylene plate dehumidifier, with distinctive surface properties were chosen for study. Surface free energy was measured to characterize the adhesion between liquid desiccant and solid surface. Then, the effect of surface properties on dehumidification performance was experimentally investigated. The experimental results indicated that surface wettability demonstrated positive effect on dehumidification performance by increasing wetting area and reducing falling film thickness. As surface free energy increased from 30.34\u202fmJ/m 2  to 50.61\u202fmJ/m 2 , the moisture removal rate increased from 0.155 to 0.213 with the enhancing ratio of 37.4%. A novel mass transfer correlation was developed, among which surface free energy was introduced to consider the effect of surface properties on dehumidification performance. It is estimated that 9.6% of the energy consumption could be saved by improving surface wettability of falling film dehumidifiers. This research is also very useful to other falling film applications, such as evaporators, condensers and chemical columns.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The liquid desiccant cooling system (LDCS) is regarded as a promising alternative for the traditional vapor compression cooling system due to its energy saving potential and accurate control ability of both temperature and humidity. However, metal corrosion of mass exchanger plate caused by the liquid desiccant greatly restricts the application of LDCS. The present study developed a new kind of mixed liquid desiccant to reduce the corrodibility, and the corrodibility of new mixed solution was examined as well as the dehumidification performance. The vapor pressure of the mixed solution was measured by static method firstly, and the corrosion characteristics were tested by electrochemical method and compared with the ones of normal lithium chloride (LiCl) solution. Comparative investigations were also conducted to study the dehumidification performance under various operating conditions. The experimental results indicate that the corrodibility of new mixed solution is far smaller than that of normal LiCl solution, and the dehumidification performance in terms of absolute moisture change and effectiveness has a significant improvement of 8.7\u201314.3% and 5.8\u201315.2% for the newly mixed solution compared with LiCl solution because of the excellent wettability of mixed solution on dehumidifier. The wetting area increases from 0.172\u202fm 2  for LiCl solution to 0.184\u202fm 2  for mixed solution. In addition, a correlation to predict the dehumidification effectiveness of the mixed solution was also proposed with the average mean absolute relative deviation of 4.51%. The newly developed mixed liquid desiccant is a promising alternative for the commercial application of LDCS with small corrodibility and better dehumidification performance.",

        "abstract": "The falling film liquid desiccant air conditioning system is promising to achieve a low pressure drop and low possibility of solution droplets carried by air. However, the insufficient wetted area was found by previous researchers, and its value is difficult to be determined. With a single channel internally heated regenerator, this paper experimentally investigated the influencing factors affecting the wetted area and film thickness, by obtaining the flow size with a thermal camera. The increasing wetted area could improve the mass transfer significantly while the performance decreased with the increasing film thickness of liquid desiccant. The thickness of solution distributor impacted the initial film width most greatly, and it also significantly influenced the film thickness and flow velocity. Under incomplete wetting conditions, the film width increased with the solution mass flow rate proportionally, and the change of the distribution of film thickness was found simultaneously. However, solution temperature and concentration contribute insignificantly, and the direct impact of air and water on wetted area was minor. A 3-D model was developed, for predicting the wetting factor, and film thickness and flow velocity of the falling film. The calculation results were compared with experiment ones with average errors of 8.74% and 9.76%. The newly developed model could significantly improve the accuracy of performance evaluation and simulation of liquid desiccant air conditioning systems. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Liquid desiccant air dehumidification is a promising dehumidification technology with lower energy consumption, less pollution and more flexible humidity control. However, the incomplete wetting conditions of liquid desiccant deteriorates the dehumidification performance and limits the development. Therefore, how to enhance the surface wettability is critical to improving the dehumidification performance as well as reducing the building energy consumption. In this paper, a novel TiO 2  superhydrophilic coating was applied in a plate dehumidifier to enhance the surface wettability and improve the dehumidification performance. Firstly, the characterization of the coating was conducted. The test results showed the surface wettability was effectively improved with the contact angle dramatically decreasing from 84.6\u00b0 to 8.8\u00b0. Then two single-channel internally-cooled liquid desiccant dehumidifiers were fabricated to investigate the effect of TiO 2  coating on dehumidification performance. The experimental results indicated that the dehumidification performance was significantly enhanced with the mean enhancing ratios of 1.60 and 1.63 for moisture removal rate and dehumidification efficiency, respectively. Besides, the influencing factors on dehumidification performance were analysed comprehensively. Based on the analysis, the new empirical correlations of mass transfer coefficients were developed with different contact angles. Lastly, the energy consumption of liquid desiccant air-conditioning system with coated dehumidifiers for a commercial building in Hong Kong was simulated and around 80    MW  \u22c5  h     of the electricity consumption could be saved. This study is helpful to researchers and engineers who are interested in enhancing the dehumidification performance and reducing the building energy consumption.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Falling film has been observed to shrink along its flow direction in a plate dehumidifier. The shrinkage of film reduces the absorption contact area and hence deteriorates the mass transfer performance. Another interesting phenomenon has also been observed, and the condensation of water vapor would occur on the non-wetted area in an internal cooling dehumidifier with a low cooling water temperature. Nevertheless, the film shrinkage and vapor condensation during the dehumidification process were seldom reported. This study developed a new model with the consideration of both the above two factors and phenomena. Besides, a new Sherwood number correlation was proposed based on the experimental data. The influences of different parameters on dehumidification performance were identified. The results indicated that the new model is able to predict the film shrinkage accurately with the average relative wetting ratio difference less than 4%, and the proposed Sherwood number correlation has high prediction accuracy with the mean absolute relative deviation of 7.1%. Then, the weather data of a typical summer day in Hong Kong was chosen to evaluate the influence of vapor condensation. It was found that compared with the situation without condensation, the relative increment of absolute moisture change ranges from 1.2% to 10.7% when concerning vapor condensation. The increment is closely related with the cooling water temperature and air humidity. In the typical summer day, the absolute moisture change has a relative 6.3% increment with the consideration of vapor condensation under certain operating conditions.",

        "abstract": "The falling film liquid desiccant air conditioning system is a promising technology. The wetted area, as a key factor affecting the system performance, is significantly influenced by the plate surface temperature. With a single channel internally heated regenerator, this paper experimentally investigated the impact of plate temperature on the wetted area and system performance, by obtaining the film area and temperature with a thermal camera. LiCl was chosen as the desiccant. By reducing the film contraction in the transverse direction, the increase of plate surface temperature could enhance the wetted area significantly, especially for the low solution mass flow rate. The growth rate of area increased from 0.0017 to 0.0022 m2/ C when the flow rate reduced from 0.062 to 0.034 kg/s. The regeneration performance also increased with the temperature. A theoretical model with an analytical solution was developed to obtain the wetted area by describing the film contraction caused by the Marangoni effect. A good match was observed for the prediction and experimental results, with an average error of 10.8%. Furthermore, the wetted width was numerically found to also increase with the decrease of film thickness and contact angle, and its change with the solution concentration was slight. This research helps researchers and engineers to accurately predict the wetted area of falling film and to improve the heat and mass transfer performance of liquid desiccant regeneration system. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The study presented in this paper proposes the development of a mathematical vertical ring-coil model used to describe the heat transfer process of HGHEs with vertical spiral coils. In this new model, the spiral heat exchanger is simplified as a series of ring coils that inject/extract heat in/from a semi-infinite medium. A single ring model in an infinite medium is first introduced. Using images and superposition, a multiple ring-coils analytical solution is then given. The significant influence on the heat transfer performance of HGHEs temperature variation of the ground surface is then considered. A periodically changed boundary condition is being taken into consideration in the modeling process. The validity of the model was examined by a field test and a 3-D simulation model. The analytical solutions may provide a desirable and better tool for the simulation/design HGHEs with vertical spiral coils.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Pile geothermal heat exchanger (PGHE) has attracted great interests in recent years, but some new challenges have emerged with its application, especially in understanding its thermo-mechanical behaviors. In this paper, based on the experimental data from a modified direct shear test, a finite element simulation model is developed to investigate the thermo-mechanical behavior of PGHE. The simulation model has been verified by an in-suit test. The influence of interface behavior, thermal loads, and soil properties on the PGHE\u2019s thermo-mechanical behavior has been investigated. The results show that the changes in contact force and friction coefficient has to be considered in a comprehensive way in estimating the influence of thermal load on the bearing capacity of PGHE. Compared with the results without thermal loads, bearing capacity of PGHE shows a decreasing ratio of 8.7%, and an increasing ratio of heating is found to be 13.2%. In addition, the simulation results suggest that without head load imposed, at a certain depth, the axial stress has a linear relationship with the change of temperature, but when a head load is imposed, the linear relationship is only separately valid in each temperature region (heating or cooling). The thermo-mechanical performance of PGHE should be fully considered during the design stage, and this paper has the certain actual reference significance to engineering applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Adding additives into liquid desiccant cooling system (LDCS) can enhance its mass transfer performance. However, the additives proposed by previous researchers are volatile and odorous which is a great threat to the indoor air quality. Therefore, this study introduced a new kind of non-volatile, odorless and nontoxic additive, i.e. polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP-K30), into LDCS for better dehumidification performance. Comparative studies were carried out to investigate the dehumidification performance of LiCl solution with and without the additive PVP-K30. The mass fraction PVP-K30 was chosen to be 0.4%. The results show that the dehumidification rate and dehumidification effectiveness have an average relative increment of 22.7% and 19.9% respectively with the addition of surfactant. The enhancement is attributed to the reduction of surface tension of liquid desiccant which is demonstrated by the decrement of contact angle from 58.5\u00b0 to 28.0\u00b0. Correspondingly, the wetting ratio of desiccant falling film on plate has a relative increment of 16.9% from 82.7% to 96.7%, and the film thickness of falling film decreases from 0.681\u202fmm to 0.583\u202fmm. To sum up, the adding of additive PVP-K30 into LDCS provides an effective and practical way to enhance the vapor absorption performance in an absorber and so does the system efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Nanofluids could enhance both the heat and mass transfer performance due to its outstanding thermal properties. However, most previous studies only focused on the heat transfer while the mass transfer performance of nanofluids is seldom examined. In the paper, it proposed a novel LiCl/H 2 O-MWNTs nanofluid for dehumidification by adding multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) into Lithium chloride (LiCl) solution. The stable LiCl/water-MWNTs nanofluid was prepared by adding surfactant polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) through mechanical methods. The concentration of MWNTs and PVP were 0.1\u202fwt% and 0.4\u202fwt% respectively. The influences of various parameters on dehumidification performance of LiCl/H 2 O solution, LiCl/H 2 O-PVP solution and LiCl/H 2 O-MWNTs nanofluid were investigated and compared. The experimental results show that LiCl/H 2 O-PVP solution and nanofluid can enhance the dehumidification rate by up to 26.1% and 25.9% as a result of contact angle reduction. The contact angles decrease from 58.5\u00b0 for LiCl solution to 28\u00b0 and 26.5\u00b0 for the two modified solutions respectively, the wetting areas increase from 0.172\u202fm 2  to 0.209\u202fm 2  and 0.210\u202fm 2 , and the film thickness reduces from 0.681\u202fmm to 0.583\u202fmm and 0.577\u202fmm correspondingly. However, the dehumidification enhancement of nanofluid can be only attributed to the adding of surfactant, and the adding of 0.1\u202fwt% MWNTs has undetected effect on the dehumidification performance in the present study. The results can provide some guidance for the mass transfer enhancement in liquid desiccant dehumidification in terms of adding surfactant and nanoparticle.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The paper experimentally and numerically investigated the enhancement of LiCl falling film regeneration performance in a plate type regenerator by adding surfactant polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). Experimentally, by adding surfactant PVP and adopting mechanical methods, steady nanofluid containing MWNTs was successfully fabricated. The regeneration characteristics of LiCl/H 2 O solution, LiCl/H 2 O-PVP solution and LiCl/H 2 O-MWNTs nanofluid were identified quantitatively. Compared with the regeneration rate of the LiCl/H 2 O solution, the values of the LiCl/H 2 O-PVP solution and nanofluid are on average 24.9% and 24.7% greater. These enhancements can be attributed to the increase of mass transfer area and decrease of falling film thickness, which is caused by a decrease in contact angles. However, adding 0.1\u202fwt% MWNTs to the LiCl/H 2 O-PVP solution has negligible influence on the regeneration rate. The three solutions have nearly the same mass transfer coefficients under comparable operating conditions. Theoretically, a mathematical model was built with the consideration of film contraction to describe the simultaneous heat and mass transfer processes in the regenerator. The calculated falling film wetting areas agree well with the measured ones, with a relative difference of less than 6%. The mean absolute relative deviation between the computational regeneration rates and experimental ones for the LiCl/H 2 O solution, LiCl/H 2 O-PVP solution and LiCl/H 2 O-MWNTs nanofluid are 9.01%, 3.95% and 4.22%, respectively, which demonstrates the accuracy of the developed model. The experimental data and newly developed numerical model are helpful for the study of regeneration enhancement and system design of liquid desiccant cooling systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The flow boiling heat transfer of refrigerant R134a in horizontal multiport mini-channel was experimentally investigated in this paper. Two kinds of mini-channels made of aluminum alloy with the hydraulic diameter of 0.63\u202fmm for 23 rectangular channels and 0.72\u202fmm for 14 rectangular channels were studied. Electric heating film was adopted to provide direct uniform heat flux. The experimental results were obtained with the vapor quality between 0 and 1, the heat flux ranging from 10 to 60\u202fkW/m 2 , the mass flux ranging from 128 to 560\u202fkg/(m 2 .s) and the saturation pressure from 0.22 to 0.58\u202fMPa. It was found that nucleate boiling dominates in the low vapor quality region and the heat transfer coefficients of mini-channel are higher than those in conventional channel. The heat transfer coefficients increase with the increasing of both heat flux and saturation pressure but have little dependence with the mass flux. In the high vapor quality region, connective boiling is the main contributor. Heat flux and saturation pressure have little influence on the heat transfer coefficients, but the influence of mass flux is obvious. There is a small increase in heat transfer coefficient with an increase of mass flux. Accordingly, a new correlation for flow boiling heat transfer in mini-channel of R134a was proposed based on Gungor and Winterton correlation. The mean relation deviation is \u22121.76% and the mean absolute relation deviation is 19.0% respectively. This new correlation is proved to have an obvious accuracy improvement in predicting the flow boiling heat transfer coefficient of R134a in mini-channel. The present work can provide a guidance to the design of mini-channel heat exchanger.",

        "abstract": "The traditional vapor compression cooling system (VCS) has been criticized for its heavy reliance on electricity consumption and limited control ability of humidity. Compared with the VCS, the liquid desiccant cooling system (LDCS) is more efficient by handling the sensible and latent load separately. The present study investigated the regeneration and corrosion characteristics of an anodized aluminum plate regenerator for the first time. Comparative tests were conducted to present the regeneration and corrosion characteristics of the normal and anodized regenerator. The influence of internal heating on the regeneration performance was also identified. The results showed that the corrosion rate was reduced from 0.0005218 mm/year for normal aluminum to 0.000011 m/year for anodized one under the same operating conditions. However, pitting corrosion was observed at operating conditions with high solution temperature, as the anodized layer of anodized aluminum was damaged due to the high temperature. Compared with the normal aluminum regenerator, the anodized one had an average enhancement of 24% and 23.7% in terms of regeneration rate and effectiveness, respectively. It was attributed to the increment of surface energy from 26.4 mN/m for normal aluminum to 47.6 mN/m for anodized plate. Besides, it was found that, compared with adiabatic one, the internally-heated regenerator improved the regeneration rate by 6.0%~38% and the regeneration effectiveness by 6.3%~32% depending on the operating conditions. The advantage of present study is that it can guide the design of anodized aluminum regenerator for LDCS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The liquid desiccant cooling system (LDCS) is a promising alternative for the conventional vapor compression system due to its high energy efficiency. To enhance the mass transfer between the regeneration air and liquid desiccant in the regenerator, the paper firstly introduced a kind of surfactant called polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP-K30) which was added into the LiCl solution for better desiccant regeneration performance. The falling film characteristics and regeneration performance were investigated and compared with and without surfactant. The results indicated that the contact angle of desiccant solution on plate decreased from 58.5\u00b0 to 28.0\u00b0 by adding surfactant with 0.4% of concentration. The average wetting area increased from 0.174\u202fm 2  to 0.209\u202fm 2  with a relative increment of 20.1% with the addition of surfactant. Correspondingly, the film thickness had a reduction of 0.103\u202fmm from 0.696\u202fmm to 0.593\u202fmm averagely. The regeneration rate had an average enhancement of 26.3% under the same working conditions, resulting from the decrement of solution contact angle with the addition of the surfactant. Finally, correlations to predict the mass transfer coefficient were proposed with and without surfactant and the mean absolute relative deviation between the results of correlations and the experiments were kept within 8%. The results and findings of present paper could be applied to guide the design of compact regenerator for higher regeneration performance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This study first fabricated a new mixed liquid desiccant solution via the addition of hydroxyethyl urea to lithium chloride solution to reduce its causticity in a metal-based regenerator. The formula of the new solution\u201425% LiCl, 39% hydroxyethyl urea, and 36% water\u2014was determined according to the vapor pressure measured with the static method. Accordingly, its basic thermal properties (e.g., density, viscosity, and conductivity) were measured and compared with those of a 35% LiCl solution. The corrosion characteristics of the mixed solution and the LiCl solution were analyzed with an electrochemical testing method. The regeneration performances of the solutions were experimentally studied, and the results show that the new solution significantly reduced causticity due to the addition of hydroxyethyl urea and a reduction in LiCl concentration. The regeneration effectiveness showed an average relative increase of 14.1% because of the larger wetting ratio and greater fluctuation of falling film. The wetting ratio increased from 81.5% to 87.8%, and the standard deviation of the film thickness increased from 25.441\u202f\u03bcm to 31.672\u202f\u03bcm with more rigorous fluctuations. Finally, an empirical equation for regeneration effectiveness was developed with an average absolute relative deviation of 4.01%, which provides a useful guide for the design of regenerators.",

This paper newly proposed an evaporation pressure-capacity control strategy to simulate the vapor cycle system by modulating the EEV opening to control the evaporation pressure rather than the superheat. A dual SISO expert PID controller with a feedforward compensator was employed to compare the control performance of the conventional superheat-capacity control strategy with the developed strategy. Experimental results showed both control strategies could regulate the capacity satisfactorily, but the new strategy could maintain the evaporation pressure stably. The conventional method failed to maintain the superheat around the target because of the violent oscillation observed. The developed strategy could regulate the aircraft vapor cycle system smoothly and reliably even under fast and widely changing environment. In addition, violent oscillation of superheat with big change width and quick frequency was observed and reported.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The falling film dehumidifier is a key component in the liquid desiccant cooling system (LDCS). However, the most commonly used metals, such as steel and aluminum, can hardly resist the erosion of liquid desiccant. It greatly limits the fabrication of compact dehumidifiers and hinders the promotion of LDCS. The present study introduced a novel falling film dehumidifier which was made by the metal of anodized aluminum. Experiments were carried out to compare the dehumidification performance between ordinary aluminum dehumidifier and anodized one. The influences of air temperature, mass flow rate, inlet humidity and solution temperature, mass flow rate, temperature on dehumidification performance were identified. The results showed that the anodized aluminum could alleviate the erosion significantly. In addition, with the surface treatment by anodizing, the contact angle of lithium chloride solution decreased from 85.2\u00b0 on an ordinary aluminum plate to 43.1\u00b0 on an anodized one. Accordingly, the wetting area on the plate dehumidifier increased from 0.143\u00a0m 2  to 0.178\u00a0m 2  with a 24.5% increment at certain operating conditions. Both the absolute moisture removal and dehumidification effectiveness increased in various degrees for anodized dehumidifier compared with the ordinary type. The relative increments could reach up to 50.6% and 36.7% under certain conditions respectively. The newly introduced anodized aluminum dehumidifiers can not only alleviate the plate corrosion but also improve the dehumidification capability due to smaller surface contact angles, which can be promisingly applied in LDCS.",

        "abstract": "Dust deposition on a solar photovoltaic (PV) system mounted on the windward roof of an isolated building was investigated by CFD simulation. The SST k-\u03c9 turbulence model with UDF inlet profiles and the discrete particle model (DPM) were adopted to simulate the wind flow fields and the dust deposition behavior, respectively. The CFD wind flow velocity profiles around the building were in good agreement with experimental results reported in the literature. The effects of various dust particle sizes, differing quantities of released dust particles, and the force of gravity on the rates of dust deposition upon the PV panels were investigated in detail. It was found that the dust deposition rate first rose and then declined with the increase of dust particle size. The maximum deposition rate was about 0.28% for 10\u03bcm dust, and the minimum deposition rate was about 0.13% for 50\u03bcm dust. Gravity also had a significant effect on the rate of dust deposition for large-particle dust (dpu003e5\u03bcm), and the rate could reach 75% for 50\u03bcm dust. However, the effect of gravity on dust deposition was less than 5% for small-particle dust (dpu003c5\u03bcm). The effect of releasing differing quantities of dust particles on the dust deposition rate was less than 8%. Moreover, the mechanisms by which dust was deposited on the PV roof were analyzed and discussed. Finally, a simple empirical model was developed to estimate the PV efficiency reduction ratios in relation to exposure time, as based on this study\u2019s CFD results and the experimental data reported in the literature.",

The Eulerian-Lagrangian approach based on Reynolds stress model (RSM) with turbulent fluctuation correction and discrete particle model (DPM) was adopted to investigate particle deposition behaviors in ducts. Particle deposition velocity profile in uniform-section duct was first predicted and validated well with the literature data. Then, particle deposition velocities, air flow field structures, particle trajectories and deposition mechanisms in variable-section ducts with different expanding and contracting ratios were investigated and analyzed in details. For expanding duct cases, particle deposition velocity first keeps constant, then greatly increases, finally decreases with the increase of particle size. The maximum particle deposition rate appears for 20\u201330\u00a0\u03bcm particles. As the growth of expanding ratio, the particle deposition velocities are significantly reduced for       d    p    u003e  5    \u03bc  m     while almost not affected for       d    p      5    \u03bc  m    . For contracting duct cases, particle deposition velocity keeps increasing when particle size increases. Moreover, particle deposition velocities are greatly increased for       d    p      30    \u03bc  m     but very closed for       d    p    u003e  30    \u03bc  m    , when the contracting ratio increases. The modification of deposition distance, the variation of air velocity along the streamwise direction as well as air flow structures are the main mechanisms to change the particle deposition characteristics, compared with uniform duct case.

Therefore, cleaning the deposited dust on the PV module surface is crucial in engineering applications to maintain the high power output of solar power plants, especially in desert areas. Nevertheless, it is difficult to predict the reasonable cleaning frequency for PV modules by traditional methods. In this paper, a novel model to simply estimate the cleaning frequency was developed for dirty PV modules in desert areas based on the dust deposition velocity and the relationship between deposited dust density and PV module power performance. The studied parameters are the installation tilt angles, the dust concentration in the ambient air and the representative average particle diameter. Based on this model, module cleaning frequency for desert regions is approximately 20 days when the power output reduction and particle concentration equal to 5% and 100 \u03bcg/m3, respectively. In addition, the effects of accumulation density, average particle diameter, tilt angles and wind velocity on the cleaning frequency are discussed and analyzed respectively.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, the particle resuspension theory was used to estimate the wind cleaning process of the dust particles deposited on flat solar photovoltaic (PV) module surfaces. The model includes the effects of adhesion force, as well as, the hydrodynamic force and torque for rolling detachment model in the analysis. The required shear velocity and actual wind velocity for resuspension of particles with diameter ranging from 0.1 to 100\u00a0\u00b5m were evaluated, varied from 0.23 to 57.56\u00a0m/s and 0.82 to 2219.8\u00a0m/s, respectively. The effect of particle size and composition on the required removal velocity was also analyzed. Verified with the experimental deposited dust size distribution, large particles with diameter larger than 1\u00a0\u00b5m were effectively removed by wind. However, wind cleaning process for small particles was found not to be effective due to the large required shear velocity for detachment. In addition to particle sizes, the influence of compositions on the wind cleaning process can be negligible.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Aerosol deposition is highly concerned recently due to its significant impact on surface glass cleaning, glass transmittance and energy conversion of building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). Thus, this paper reviewed direct transmittance degradation works of PV module surface glasses, and employed several integrated and improved experiment and model methods to investigate the correlation effects of PM2.5 deposition dynamics, tilt angles, surface conditions and self-cleaning TiO 2  nanocoating on glasses. Series of physical models from ambient aerosol concentration to deposition density and transmittance reduction were extended or newly developed. Measured and modeled data could inter-validate with each other and literature results. The usage condition of Al-Hasan model was discovered as     0      a    p      0.10     for particle projected-area fraction under clustering particle projected-area fraction       a    p  c  p    \u2264  5  %    . Ranging from 0 to 18.7\u00a0\u03bcg/cm 2 , deposition densities with the most reductions (50\u201391%) were found under the combination of wet and nanocoating conditions due to effects of water film and low adhesive force. Generally, the average deposition densities decreased 19\u201347% with the increase of each 30\u00b0 tilt angle for different surface properties. Finally, six linear empirical models were obtained with decreasing slopes of 0.001544\u20130.001841 between fine aerosol deposition density and transmittance ratio. These observed phenomena and derived models would be useful for solar energy, building illumination or heat-transfer, and BIPV industries.",

The Reynolds stress turbulence model with UDF corrections and discrete particle model were adopted to simulate the turbulent air flow fields and particle deposition behaviours, respectively. After numerical validation with the relative literature results, pure particle deposition enhancement ratios, flow drag increase, comprehensive deposition efficiency and deposition enhancement mechanisms were investigated and discussed in details. The findings showed that the hybrid-size ribs with small rib spacing have the best enhancement performance on particle deposition for small particles (\u03c4p+u003c1). Considering the flow drag increase, the maximum deposition efficiency can reach 485 for 1\u2009\u00b5m particles for the hybrid-size ribbed cases, while it is just 425 for the same-size ribbed case.

        "abstract": "This paper reports an experimental investigation of the dust particle deposition process on solar photovoltaic (PV) modules with different surface temperatures by a heating plate to illustrate the effect of the temperature difference (thermophoresis) between the module surface and the surrounding air on the dust accumulation process under different operating temperatures. In general, if the temperature of PV modules is increased, the energy conversion efficiency of the modules is decreased. However, in this study, it is firstly found that higher PV module surface temperature differences result in a higher energy output compared with those modules with lower temperature differences because of a reduced accumulation of dust particles. The measured deposition densities of dust particles were found to range from 0.54 g/m 2 to 0.85 g/m 2 under the range of experimental conditions and the output power ratios were found to increase from 0.861 to 0.965 with the increase in the temperature difference from 0 to 50 \u00b0C. The PV module with a higher temperature difference experiences a lower dust density because of the effect of the thermophoresis force arising from the temperature gradient between the module surface and its surrounding air. In addition, dust particles have a significant impact on the short circuit current, as well as the output power. However, the influence of particles on open circuit voltage can be negligible.",

        "title": "A numerical study of bend-induced particle deposition in and behind duct bends",
        "abstract": "This paper investigated the microparticle deposition and distribution due to the presence of duct bends by employing the Eulerian approach with Reynolds stress turbulent model and a Lagrangian trajectory method. The air velocity, particle velocity and particle deposition velocity were validated with available experimental data. Several particle deposition ratios were proposed to describe the particle accumulation due to bends. Particle deposition velocities in and behind bends were analyzed numerically. It is found that bend walls with surfaces of higher capture velocity tend to accumulate more contaminant particles as seen with an increased factor of 1.2 times on particle deposition velocity. Particle deposition reaches a maximum value near bend outlet, e.g. 15.2 times deposition ratio for particles of   \u00a0=\u00a023\u00a0\u03bcm, and decay exponentially to a status of fully developed deposition in approximately 10 length. Compared to traditional consideration of sole deposition in bends, a new general concept of total deposition including that in bends and behind bends is proposed to better describe the particle deposition induced by bends since the enhancement deposition ratios behind bends compose 42-99% in the total ratios for particles of   \u00a0=\u00a03-23\u00a0\u03bcm. Furthermore, models of fast power and exponential decay trend are demonstrated to uncover the relationship among enhancement factor of deposition velocity behind bend, dimensionless distance behind bends and particle Stokes number. The present study can contribute to the understanding and controlling of contaminant aerosol flow behavior in ducts, e.g. particle sampling, removal and associated epidemiologic study between particle and human health.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to outline the clinical features and outcomes of IgG4-related hypophysitis (IgG4-RH) patients in a tertiary medical center. We reviewed clinical manifestations and imaging and pituitary function tests at baseline, as well as during follow-up. Ten patients were included. The mean age at diagnosis of IgG4-RH was 48.4 (16.0-64.0) years. An average of 3 (0-9) extrapituitary organs were involved. Five patients had panhypopituitarism, three had only posterior hypopituitarism, one had only anterior hypopituitarism, and one had a normal pituitary function. One patient in our study had pituitary mass biopsy, lacking IgG4-positive cells despite lymphocyte infiltration forming an inflammatory pseudotumor. Five patients with a clinical course of IgG4-RH less than nine months and a whole course of IgG4-RD less than two years were managed with glucocorticoids, while three patients with a longer history were administered glucocorticoids plus immunosuppressive agents. One patient went through surgical excision, and one patient was lost to follow-up. All patients showed a prompt response clinically, but only three patients had normalized serum IgG4 levels. Two patients who took medications for less than six months relapsed. . IgG4-RD is a broad disease, and all physicians involved have to be aware of the possibility of pituitary dysfunction. Younger patients should be expected. The histopathological feature of pituitary gland biopsy could be atypical. For patients with a longer history, the combination of GC and immunosuppressive agents is favorable. Early and adequate courses of treatment are crucial for the management of IgG4-RH. With GC and/or immunosuppressant treatment, however, pituitary function or diabetes insipidus did not improve considerably.",

        "abstract": "Granular cell tumors (GCTs) of the neurohypophysis are rare neoplastic diseases of the pituitary. Due to the rare nature of the disease, previous descriptions have been limited to single case, small series or simple review. In the present study, a systematic literature was performed. We reported three cases in our medical center and conducted 98 up-to-inclusion-criteria cases. Data was gathered on different aspects of GCTs' characteristics, including demographics, clinical features, laboratory features, histological features, immunocytochemical features, radiological features and treatment, in order to elucidate any associations useful in determining pathogenesis and appropriate treatment. Female sex was significantly associated with GCTs (p < 0.001). The most common presenting symptom and tentative diagnosis were ophthalmological defects in 61.2% and pituitary adenoma preoperatively in 18.4%, respectively. Most neurohypophysial GCTs possess immunopositivity for S-100 protein (59.1%, 26/44) and negative staining for GFAP (69.8%, 30/43). These findings lend strong support to the suggestion that tumors probably remain in the \"transitional\" cell type. This article details the first systematic review of GCTs. Implications for pathogenesis, and a suggested clinical approach are discussed.",

The cause of short stature is broad, in which genetic factors play a substantial role, especially in primary growth disorders. However, identifying the molecular causes for short stature remains as a challenge because of the high heterogeneity of the phenotypes. Here, whole exome sequencing (WES) was used to identify the genetic causes of short stature with unknown etiology for 20 patients aged from 1 to 16 years old. The genetic causes of short stature were identified in 9 of the 20 patients, corresponding to a molecular diagnostic rate of 45%. Notably, in 2 of the 9 patients identified with genetic causes, the diagnosed diseases based on WES are different from the original clinical diagnosis. Our results highlight the clinical utility of WES in the diagnosis of rare, high heterogeneity disorders.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to outline the clinical features and outcomes of IgG4-related hypophysitis (IgG4-RH) patients in a tertiary medical center. We reviewed clinical manifestations and imaging and pituitary function tests at baseline, as well as during follow-up. Ten patients were included. The mean age at diagnosis of IgG4-RH was 48.4 (16.0\u201364.0) years. An average of 3 (0\u20139) extrapituitary organs were involved. Five patients had panhypopituitarism, three had only posterior hypopituitarism, one had only anterior hypopituitarism, and one had a normal pituitary function. One patient in our study had pituitary mass biopsy, lacking IgG4-positive cells despite lymphocyte infiltration forming an inflammatory pseudotumor. Five patients with a clinical course of IgG4-RH less than nine months and a whole course of IgG4-RD less than two years were managed with glucocorticoids, while three patients with a longer history were administered glucocorticoids plus immunosuppressive agents. One patient went through surgical excision, and one patient was lost to follow-up. All patients showed a prompt response clinically, but only three patients had normalized serum IgG4 levels. Two patients who took medications for less than six months relapsed. Conclusions. IgG4-RD is a broad disease, and all physicians involved have to be aware of the possibility of pituitary dysfunction. Younger patients should be expected. The histopathological feature of pituitary gland biopsy could be atypical. For patients with a longer history, the combination of GC and immunosuppressive agents is favorable. Early and adequate courses of treatment are crucial for the management of IgG4-RH. With GC and/or immunosuppressant treatment, however, pituitary function or diabetes insipidus did not improve considerably.",

        "abstract": "Aldosterone synthase deficiency (ASD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe hyperkalemia, salt loss, vomiting, severe dehydration and failure to thrive. ASD is a life-threatening electrolyte imbalance in infants resulting from mutations in CYP11B2. We described ASD in a Chinese male infant with vomiting, poor feeding and failure to thrive. He was mildly dehydrated, with a weight of 6 kg (-3.45 SDS) and length of 67 cm (-3.10 SDS). Laboratory tests showed hyponatremia (119 mmol/L), serum potassium 5.4 mmol/L, low plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity (PRA) levels. Next-generation sequencing of his DNA revealed compound heterozygous mutations in CYP11B2, a known variant c.1391_1393delTGC (p.Leu464del, rs776404064) and a novel variant c.1294delA (p.Arg432Glyfs*37). The HEK-293T expression system was used to investigate the variants, demonstrating negligible aldosterone synthesis compared with WT CYP11B2. The patient started fludrocortisone and subsequently gained 3.2 kg of weight and normalized serum sodium (137 mmol/L). We further reviewed reported cases of ASD, summarizing clinical features and CYP11B2 mutations; missense and nonsense mutations are most frequent. Fludrocortisone treatment is essential for ASD, and the need for mineralocorticoid replacement wanes with age; eventually, therapy can be discontinued for many affected children. Our study broadens the ASD phenotypic spectrum and shows the efficiency of next-generation sequencing for patients with atypical clinical manifestations.",

Methods We screened eight patients with non-classical (NC) 21-OHD and 35 with classical 21-OHD, and detected nine known mutations. Results The most frequent mutation among the 43 21-OHD cases was p.Ile172Asn (allele frequency, 36.0%), followed by c.290-13A/C\u2009>\u2009G (20.9%), Del (8.6%), p.Pro30Leu (7.0%), p.Gln318Ter (7.0%), p.Val281Leu (4.7%), p.Arg356Trp (2.3%), p.[Ile236Asn; Val237Glu; Met239Lys] (2.3%), and E3\u03948\u2009bp (1.2%). The frequency spectrum of CYP21A2 mutations in the Chinese population was similar to that in the Japanese population, except that p.Val281Leu was identified in Chinese NC21-OHD patients at a frequency of 25.0%, whereas it was absent in Japanese patients. We found that genotype could predict phenotype in 88.3% of patients. Conclusion Some characteristics appear to be unique to the Chinese population, but genotype was strongly predictive of phenotype.",

Impulsive decision making may contribute to relapse through a poorly considered assessment of the consequences of drug use. Drug cues robustly increase subjective craving, which is frequently associated with relapse.The present study explored the effects of drug-related cues on decision making and craving in heroin addicts at different abstinence times: 1, 3, 12, and 24 months.The 75 male participants were given 5 min exposure to neutral and drug-associated cues while decision making performance, craving, blood pressure, heart rate, and emotional state pre- and post-exposure were assessed. The Iowa Gambling Task was used to evaluate decision making ability in heroin addicts.Drug-related cues exacerbated impulsive decision making and increased craving, heart rate, and systolic pressure in heroin addicts at all abstinence times.Drug-related cues aggravated decision making and increased craving in former heroin addicts who had been drug-free for 1-24 months, which might have significant clinical implications for the prevention of relapse.",

        "abstract": "Calcineurin is a serine/threonine protein phosphatase that regulates neurotransmission, neuronal structure and plasticity, and neuronal excitability in mood disorders, including depression. Increasing evidence has suggested that calcineurin is involved in the regulation of depressive-like behavior. However, little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the mood-regulating effects of calcineurin. We investigated the potential mechanism by which calcineurin mediates the development of depressive-like behavior and the involvement of calcineurin in the action of antidepressant medication in the chronic mild stress (CMS) model. The results showed that rats exposed to CMS had decreased calcineurin activity, measured by increased phospho-synapsin I S62/67 (pSynapsin) and decreased calcineurin-A\u03b1 levels, specifically in the CA3 but not CA1 or dentate gyrus (DG) subfields of the hippocampus. Calcineurin inhibition in the CA3 but not DG by microinfusion of cyclosporine-A (2 \u03bcg) induced depressive-like behavior in normal rats and exacerbated depressive-like performance in CMS-treated rats. Additionally, calcineurin inhibition in the CA3 but not DG reversed the antidepressant-like activity of venlafaxine. Calcineurin inhibition in the CA3 also reduced metabotropic glutamate 2/3 receptor (mGluR2/3) expression levels. mGluR2/3 activation by its agonist LY354740 (100 ng) in the CA3 reversed the depressive-like behavior induced by cyclosporine-A administration. Finally, chronic venlafaxine (40 mg/kg) treatment increased calcineurin activity, reflected by decreased pSynapsin and increased calcineurin-A\u03b1 protein levels in the CA3 but not CA1 or DG. These findings indicate that CA3 calcineurin signaling probably mediated through mGluR2/3 participates in the development of depression and the behavioral responses to antidepressant treatment.",

The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of mild tone exposure (CS) during slow wave sleep (SWS) on fear memory extinction in humans.The healthy volunteers underwent an auditory fear conditioning paradigm on the experimental night, during which tones served as the CS, and a mild shock served as the US. They were then randomly assigned to four groups. Three groups were exposed to the CS for 3 or 10 min or an irrelevant tone (control stimulus, CtrS) for 10 min during SWS. The fourth group served as controls and was not subjected to any interventions. All of the subjects completed a memory test 4 h after SWS-rich stage to evaluate the effect on fear extinction. Moreover, we conducted similar experiments using an independent group of subjects during the daytime to test whether the memory extinction effect was specific to the sleep condition.Ninety-six healthy volunteers (44 males) aged 18-28 y.Participants exhibited undisturbed sleep during 2 consecutive nights, as assessed by sleep variables (all P > 0.05) from polysomnographic recordings and power spectral analysis. Participants who were re-exposed to the 10 min CS either during SWS and wakefulness exhibited attenuated fear responses (wake-10 min CS, P < 0.05; SWS-10 min CS, P < 0.01).Conditioned stimulus re-exposure during SWS promoted fear memory extinction without altering sleep profiles.",

        "title": "AMPK Signaling in the Dorsal Hippocampus Negatively Regulates Contextual Fear Memory Formation.",
        "abstract": "Both the formation of long-term memory (LTM) and dendritic spine growth that serves as a physical basis for the long-term storage of information require de novo protein synthesis. Memory formation also critically depends on transcription. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a transcriptional regulator that has emerged as a major energy sensor that maintains cellular energy homeostasis. However, still unknown is its role in memory formation. In the present study, we found that AMPK is primarily expressed in neurons in the hippocampus, and then we demonstrated a time-dependent decrease in AMPK activity and increase in mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity after contextual fear conditioning in the CA1 but not CA3 area of the dorsal hippocampus. Using pharmacological methods and adenovirus gene transfer to bidirectionally regulate AMPK activity, we found that increasing AMPK activity in the CA1 impaired the formation of long-term fear memory, and decreasing AMPK activity enhanced fear memory formation. These findings were associated with changes in the phosphorylation of AMPK and p70s6k and expression of BDNF and membrane GluR1 and GluR2 in the CA1. Furthermore, the prior administration of an mTORC1 inhibitor blocked the enhancing effect of AMPK inhibition on fear memory formation, suggesting that this negative regulation of contextual fear memory by AMPK in the CA1 depends on the mTORC1 signaling pathway. Finally, we found that AMPK activity regulated hippocampal spine growth associated with memory formation. In summary, our results indicate that AMPK is a key negative regulator of plasticity and fear memory formation.Neuropsychopharmacology accepted article preview online, 09 December 2015. doi:10.1038/npp.2015.355.",

        "abstract": "Recent research has used context cues (odor or auditory cues) to target memories during sleep and has demonstrated that they can enhance declarative and procedural memories. However, the effects of external cues re-presented during sleep on emotional memory are still not fully understood. In the present study, we conducted a Pavlovian fear conditioning/extinction paradigm and examined the effects of re-exposure to extinction memory associated contextual tones during slow-wave sleep (SWS) and wakefulness on fear expression. The participants underwent fear conditioning on the first day, during which colored squares served as the conditioned stimulus (CS) and a mild shock served as the unconditioned stimulus (US). The next day, they underwent extinction, during which the CSs were presented without the US but accompanied by a contextual tone (pink noise). Immediately after extinction, the participants were required to take a nap or remain awake and randomly assigned to six groups. Four of the groups were separately exposed to the associated tone (i.e. SWS-Tone group and Wake-Tone group) or an irrelevant tone (control tone, CtrT) (i.e. SWS-CtrT group and Wake-CtrT group), while the other two groups were not (i.e. SWS-No Tone group and Wake-No Tone group). Subsequently, the conditioned responses to the CSs were tested to evaluate the fear expression. All of the participants included in the final analysis showed successful levels of fear conditioning and extinction. During the recall test, the fear responses were significantly higher in the SWS-Tone group than that in the SWS-No Tone group or the SWS-CtrT group, while the Wake-Tone group exhibited more attenuated fear responses than either the Wake-No Tone group or Wake-CtrT group. Otherwise, re-exposure to auditory tones during SWS did not affect sleep profiles. These results suggest that distinct conditions during which re-exposure to an extinction memory associated contextual cue contributes to differential effects on fear expression.",

        "abstract": "It has been documented that methadone maintenance treatment is effective in reducing drug craving and relevant risk behaviors in heroin users. However, it is not understood whether methadone maintenance treatment impairs the dopamine transporter in the striatum. To establish whether chronic opiate use might impair brain dopamine neurons in humans, we assessed dopamine transporter (DAT) uptake function in the striatum (caudate and putamen), and analyzed the correlation between DAT in the striatum and heroin craving and subjective anxiety in former heroin users with prolonged abstinence and in patients receiving methadone maintenance treatment. Binding of [(11)C]-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-aryltropane ([(11)C] CFT) as a brain dopamine transporter ligand was measured with positron emission tomography (PET) in eleven former heroin users with prolonged abstinence, ten patients receiving methadone maintenance treatment and ten healthy control subjects. Heroin craving and subjective anxiety in prolonged abstinence and methadone maintenance treatment groups were assessed and the correlations between DAT of striatum and heroin craving or subjective anxiety were determined. In comparison with healthy control subjects, methadone maintenance treatment subjects had lower DAT uptake function in the bilateral caudate and putamen and prolonged abstinence subjects showed significantly lower DAT uptake function in the bilateral caudate. Moreover, in comparison to the prolonged abstinence subjects, the methadone maintenance treatment subjects showed significant decreases of DAT uptake in the bilateral putamen. DAT uptake function in bilateral striatum was not associated with heroin craving in prolonged abstinence or in methadone maintenance treatment subjects; however, DAT uptake function in the bilateral caudate was significantly correlated with subjective anxiety in methadone maintenance treatment subjects. Our findings suggest that chronic opioid use induces long-lasting striatum dopamine neuron impairment, and prolonged withdrawal from opioids can benefit the recovery of impaired dopamine neurons in the brain.",

However, the effects of long-term heavy smoking on task-independent baseline brain activity are still unknown. Here, we used a regional homogeneity (ReHo) method combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate spontaneous neural activity in the resting state in heavy smokers. Compared with controls, heavy smokers exhibited decreased ReHo in prefrontal regions, as well as increased ReHo in insula and posterior cingulate cortex. Our study may better our understanding of the neurobiological consequences of smoking.",

        "abstract": "Exposure to cocaine-associated conditioned stimuli elicits craving and increases the probability of cocaine relapse in cocaine users even after extended periods of abstinence. Recent evidence indicates that cocaine seeking can be inhibited by disrupting the reconsolidation of the cocaine cue memories and that basolateral amygdala (BLA) neuronal activity plays a role in this effect. Previous studies demonstrated that glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) plays a role in the reconsolidation of fear memory. Here, we used a conditioned place preference procedure to examine the role of GSK-3\u03b2 in the BLA in the reconsolidation of cocaine cue memories. GSK-3\u03b2 activity in the BLA, but not central amygdala (CeA), in rats that acquired cocaine (10 mg/kg)-induced conditioned place preference increased after re-exposure to a previously cocaine-paired chamber (i.e., a memory reactivation procedure). Systemic injections of the GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor lithium chloride after memory reactivation impaired the reconsolidation of cocaine cue memories and inhibited subsequent cue-induced GSK-3\u03b2 activity in the BLA. Basolateral amygdala, but not central amygdala, injections of SB216763, a selective inhibitor of GSK-3\u03b2, immediately after the reactivation of cocaine cue memories also disrupted cocaine cue memory reconsolidation and prevented cue-induced increases in GSK-3\u03b2 activity in the BLA. The effect of SB216763 on the reconsolidation of cocaine cue memories lasted at least 2 weeks and was not recovered by a cocaine priming injection. These results indicate that GSK-3\u03b2 activity in the BLA mediates the reconsolidation of cocaine cue memories.",

        "abstract": "Environmental stimuli associated with drug taking have been known to elicit drug craving and increase the likelihood of relapse, and sex differences have been observed in the development of drug addiction and relapse to drug taking. Differential cue paradigms (drug-related imagery scripts and drug-related paraphernalia) have been used to investigate cue-induced drug craving. However, there is little research on the possible gender differences in responses to drug cues in heroin-dependent individuals. This study examined whether two different stimuli, drug-related imagery scripts and drug-related paraphernalia, produce similar or different patterns of cue reactivity in heroin-dependent men and women.In the laboratory sessions, 26 male and 23 female heroin-dependent subjects were exposed to script-guided imagery of heroin-related cue situations and to heroin-related paraphernalia (e.g., needles, syringes, spoons, cigarette filters, and aluminum foil). Heroin craving, subjective anxiety, emotion state ratings, and cardiovascular changes were assessed.Significant increases in heroin craving were seen with drug-imagery scripts or drug paraphernalia but not with neutral-relaxing imagery or neutral-item handling. In addition, drug imagery and paraphernalia produced significant increases in subjective anxiety, negative emotions, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate, as well as decreases in positive emotion. Paraphernalia exposure was somewhat more effective than imagery scripts in inducing heroin craving, primarily reflecting a lower response to imagery scripts among men. Most other dependent measures also differed by gender, and each gender difference occurred with imagery scripts only or with paraphernalia only.The present results indicate that heroin-imagery scripts and heroin paraphernalia each induce heroin craving and emotional and cardiovascular changes, but that the changes show a complex pattern of gender differences that may need to be taken into account in future laboratory studies.",

        "abstract": "Cession of heroin use may be followed by a protracted-abstinence (PA) syndrome consisting of craving, negative mood, and physiological changes. PA symptoms have rarely been compared between drug-free and methadone-maintained former heroin users after similar lengths of heroin abstinence.Seventy former heroin users were included in one of four groups: in day 15-45 of methadone maintenance therapy (short-term MMT), in month 5-6 of MMT (long-term MMT), opiate-free for 15-45 days after methadone-assisted heroin detoxification (short-term post-methadone), and opiate-free for 5-6 months after methadone-assisted heroin detoxification (long-term post-methadone). PA symptoms (negative mood, dyssomnia, somatization, and craving), and blood pressure and pulse were assessed pre- and post-neutral videotape and pre- and post-heroin videotape.Dyssomnia and the total PA score were worst in short-term post-methadone participants, mood was best in long-term MMT participants, and cue-induced craving was least severe in long-term MMT participants. Blood pressure and pulse did not differ across groups.Even after acute withdrawal, the first months of heroin abstinence after methadone-assisted detoxification may be more difficult in terms of cue-induced craving and other PA symptoms than the first months of heroin abstinence during MMT. Our findings add to the literature supporting MMT for prevention of cue-induced heroin craving.",

        "abstract": "Fear extinction has been extensively studied, but little is known about the molecular processes that underlie the persistence of extinction long-term memory (LTM). We found that microinfusion of norepinephrine (NE) into the CA1 area of the dorsal hippocampus during the early phase (0 h) after extinction enhanced extinction LTM at 2 and 14 days after extinction. Intra-CA1 infusion of NE during the late phase (12 h) after extinction selectively promoted extinction LTM at 14 days after extinction that was blocked by the \u03b2-receptor antagonist propranolol, protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor Rp-cAMPS, and protein synthesis inhibitors anisomycin and emetine. The phosphorylation levels of PKA, cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB), GluR1, and the membrane GluR1 level were increased by NE during the late phase after extinction that was also blocked by propranolol and Rp-cAMPS. These results suggest that the enhancement of extinction LTM persistence induced by NE requires the activation of the \u03b2-receptor/PKA/CREB signaling pathway and membrane GluR1 trafficking. Moreover, extinction increased the phosphorylation levels of Erk1/2, CREB, and GluR1, and the membrane GluR1 level during the late phase, and anisomycin/emetine alone disrupted the persistence of extinction LTM, indicating that the persistence of extinction LTM requires late-phase protein synthesis in the CA1. Propranolol and Rp-cAMPS did not completely disrupt the persistence of extinction LTM, suggesting that another \u03b2-receptor/PKA-independent mechanism underlies the persistence of extinction LTM. Altogether, our results showed that enhancing hippocampal noradrenergic activity during the late phase after extinction selectively promotes the persistence of extinction LTM.",

Retention was defined as the percentage of patients remaining in treatment at a specified time point. After initial univariate analyses of retention by Pearson chi-squares, we used multilevel logistic regression to calculate summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for the effects of methadone dose (above or below 60 mg/day), flexible vs. fixed dosing strategy, and duration of follow-up.The total number of opioid-dependent participants in the 18 studies was 2831, with 1797 in MMT and 1034 receiving alternative mediations or placebo. Each variable significantly predicted retention with the other variables controlled for. Retention was greater with methadone doses > or = 60 than with doses < 60 (OR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.43-2.11). Similarly, retention was greater with flexible-dose strategies than with fixed-dose strategies (OR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.41-2.11).Higher doses of methadone and individualization of doses are each independently associated with better retention in MMT.",

        "abstract": "A conditioned stimulus (CS) is associated with a fearful unconditioned stimulus (US) in the traditional fear conditioning model. After fear conditioning, the CS-US association memory undergoes the consolidation process to become stable. Consolidated memory enters an unstable state after retrieval and requires the reconsolidation process to stabilize again. Evidence indicates the important role of Rac (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate) in the acquisition and extinction of fear memory. In the present study, we hypothesized that Rac in the amygdala is crucial for the reconsolidation of auditory and contextual Pavlovian fear memory.Auditory and contextual fear conditioning and microinjections of the Rac inhibitor NSC23766 were used to explore the role of Rac in the reconsolidation of auditory and contextual Pavlovian fear memory in rats.A microinjection of NSC23766 into the basolateral amygdala (BLA) but not central amygdala (CeA) or cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) immediately after memory retrieval disrupted the reconsolidation of auditory Pavlovian fear memory. A microinjection of NSC23766 into the CA1 but not BLA or CeA after memory retrieval disrupted the reconsolidation of contextual Pavlovian fear memory.Our experiments demonstrate that Rac in the BLA is crucial for the reconsolidation of auditory Pavlovian fear memory, whereas Rac in the CA1 is critical for the reconsolidation of contextual Pavlovian fear memory.",

        "abstract": "The intense associative memories that develop between cocaine-paired contexts and rewarding stimuli contribute to cocaine seeking and relapse. Previous studies have shown impairment in cocaine reward memories by manipulating a labile state induced by memory retrieval, but the mechanisms that underlie the destabilization of cocaine reward memory are unknown. In this study, using a Pavlovian cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure in rats, we tested the contribution of ubiquitin-proteasome system-dependent protein degradation in destabilization of cocaine reward memory. First, we found that polyubiquitinated protein expression levels and polyubiquitinated N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion (NSF) markedly increased 15 min after retrieval while NSF protein levels decreased 1 h after retrieval in the synaptosomal membrane fraction in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core. We then found that infusion of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin into the NAc core prevented the impairment of memory reconsolidation induced by the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin and reversed the effects of anisomycin on NSF and glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2) protein levels in the synaptosomal membrane fraction in the NAc core. We also found that lactacystin infusion into the NAc core but not into the shell immediately after extinction training sessions inhibited CPP extinction and reversed the extinction training-induced decrease in NSF and GluR2 in the synaptosomal membrane fraction in the NAc core. Finally, infusions of lactacystin by itself into the NAc core immediately after each training session or before the CPP retrieval test had no effect on the consolidation and retrieval of cocaine reward memory. These findings suggest that ubiquitin-proteasome system-dependent protein degradation is critical for retrieval-induced memory destabilization.",

        "abstract": "Drug addiction is a process associated with synaptic plasticity in which a drug of abuse affects the midbrain limbic system. Previous studies have indicated that drug abuse can be inhibited by disrupting the reconsolidation of a drug-related memory. Nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) plays an important role in modulating different stages of memory, including reconsolidation, but its role in the reconsolidation of a reward memory has not been investigated. The aim of the present study was to examine the role of NF-\u03baB in drug-related memory reconsolidation. We found that rats acquired morphine-induced conditioned place preference, which was inhibited by the NF-\u03baB inhibitor SN50 administered after reexposure to a previously morphine-paired chamber (i.e., a memory retrieval process). The disruptive effect of SN50 on reward memory reconsolidation was reversed by systemic injections of the histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate. These results indicate that SN50 disrupts morphine-related memory reconsolidation by inhibiting NF-\u03baB, and this effect can be reversed by inhibiting histone acetylation.",

        "abstract": "Accumulating clinical and preclinical studies have shown that the memories of the rewarding effects of drugs and their paired cues may contribute to relapse and persistent cocaine use. Glutaminergic actions in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) have been shown to regulate the rewarding effect of drugs and conditioned responses to drug-associated cues, but the role of the VTA in the acquisition, retrieval, and reconsolidation of cocaine cues is not yet known.In the present study, we used 7-chlorothiokynurenic acid (7-CTKA), an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor glycine modulatory site antagonist with no rewarding effects, to examine the role of the NMDA receptor glycine modulatory site in the acquisition, retrieval, and reconsolidation of cocaine-related reward memory using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm.Separate groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to acquire cocaine-induced CPP. Vehicle or 7-CTKA was microinjected into the VTA or substantia nigra (SN) (5 \u03bcg/\u03bcl) at different time points: 10 min before each CPP training session (acquisition), 10 min before the reactivation of CPP (retrieval), and immediately after the reactivation of CPP (reconsolidation). Cocaine-induced CPP was retested 24 h and 1 and 2 weeks after 7-CTKA administration. 7-CTKA microinjected into the VTA, but not SN, significantly impaired the acquisition, retrieval, and reconsolidation of cocaine-induced CPP without affecting cocaine-induced locomotion.Our findings suggest that the NMDA receptor glycine modulatory site in the VTA plays a major role in cocaine reward memory, and NMDA receptor glycine site antagonists may be potential pharmacotherapies for the management of relapse.",

        "abstract": "In the 25 years since drug abuse re-emerged in China in the 1980s, the National Institute of Drug Dependence (NIDD) has made many contributions to China's antidrug campaign. This present paper offers an account of the history, current status and future of drug dependence research at NIDD. NIDD was originally a research centre at Beijing Medical University, founded by the Chinese Ministry of Health to address the rapid spread of drug abuse in China. Originally, the main task of NIDD was to complete the commissions assigned by the government and university. Further developments transformed NIDD into a national research institute in the field of drug addiction that began to conduct its own research. NIDD has now created a professional team spread across several independent departments involved in neurobiological mechanisms, epidemiological surveys and monitoring, pre-clinical and clinical evaluation of new drugs (mainly analgesic drugs and detoxification drugs) and informatics and data analysis. As a university-based research institute, NIDD's funding derives mainly from grants provided by the government and financial support from international organizations. Its past and present research has a gained NIDD a reputation with both practitioners and policy makers in the field of drug addiction. In the future, NIDD will continue to engage in various aspects of drug addiction research and will enter the field of brain function.",

In present study, a cyclic RGD (cRGD) peptide with high affinity for integrin receptors of leukocytes was used to modify liposomes. The cRGD-modified liposomes (cRGDL) showed high affinity for monocytes in vitro and in vivo and co-migrated across in vitro BBB model with THP-1. The trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), a macromolecular drug, was rapidly and persistently delivered to brain for at least 12 h when loaded into cRGDL while 2.8-fold increase in drug concentration in basolateral amygdala regions related to depression was observed. A systemic administration of cRGDL-TFF3 mimicked antidepressant-like effect of direct intra-basolateral amygdala administration of TFF3 solution in rats subjected to chronic mild stress. The effective dual-brain targeting delivery resulting from the combination and co-migration of cRGDL with leukocyte cross BBB may be a promising strategy for targeted brain delivery.In an effort to treat depression, brain targeted delivery via monocyte-cRGD liposome complexes capable of crossing the intact BBB was performed in this study in a murine model. Similar approaches may be helpful in the treatment of other neuropsychiatric conditions.",

Protein kinase M\u03b6 (PKM\u03b6), an isoform of protein kinase C with persistent activity, is involved in the formation and maintenance of memory. However, less is known about the role of PKM\u03b6 in the PFC in the formation of fear memory. We investigated whether the overexpression of PKM\u03b6 enhances the formation of auditory fear memory in rats. We found that microinfusion of lentiviral vector-expressing PKM\u03b6 into the prelimbic cortex (PrL) selectively enhanced the expression of PKM\u03b6 without influencing the expression of other isoforms of PKC. The overexpression of PKM\u03b6 in the PrL enhanced the formation of long-term fear memory without affecting short-term fear memory, whereas the overexpression of PKM\u03b6 in the infralimbic cortex had no effect on either short-term or long-term fear memory. The overexpression of PKM\u03b6 in the PrL had no effect on anxiety-like behavior or locomotor activity. We also found that PKM\u03b6 overexpression potentiated the fear conditioning-induced increase in the membrane levels of glutamate subunit 2 of AMPA receptors in the PrL. These results demonstrate that the overexpression of PKM\u03b6 in the PrL but not infralimbic cortex selectively enhanced the formation of long-term fear memory, and PKM\u03b6 in the PrL may be involved in the formation of fear memory.Neuropsychopharmacology advance online publication, 25 March 2015; doi:10.1038/npp.2015.56.",

        "abstract": "Nicotine replacement treatment (NRT) can be efficacious for smoking cessation, but used by only a minority of smokers in China. Pharmacogenetic matching may improve treatment outcomes for NRT in subgroups of smokers. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of sublingual nicotine tablets (SNT) for smoking cessation and the association of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genotype with efficacy in this smoking cessation trial among Chinese smokers. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week trial of SNT with a follow-up at week 12 among 250 Chinese smokers. Efficacy and safety were evaluated at day 4 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12. Abstinence was biochemically verified by exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) and urine cotinine. The COMT Val108Met genotype was determined as a restriction fragment length polymorphism. Our results showed that the success rates for complete abstinence were greater for active versus placebo treatments at 8 weeks (48 vs. 17 %) and 12 weeks (52 vs. 19 %) (both p < 0.0001). Craving was significantly reduced from week 2 on active treatment compared to placebo. Adverse events were mild and tolerable. We found a genotype by treatment interaction at 12 weeks with greater abstinence rates in the COMT Val/Val (50 vs. 15 %) than the Met/Val + Met/Met genotypes (46 vs. 25 %). We found that SNT significantly increased smoking abstinence, reduced craving and was well tolerated, and the COMT Val/Val genotype was associated with a greater improvement in smoking cessation.",

This randomized double-blind clinical trial enrolled 60 abstinent heroin addicts and randomly assigned them to three groups: placebo, 2.5 mg and 5 mg rapamycin. The participants were given the cue-reactivity paradigm with 5 min exposures to neutral and drug-related imagery while craving, anxiety, blood pressure and heart rate pre- and post-exposure were assessed. We found that drug-related cues increased both craving and anxiety of abstinent heroin addicts, and had no effect on blood pressure and heart rate. A single high-dose of rapamycin significantly reduced the craving, but not anxiety induced by drug-related cues. Our findings suggested that rapamycin merits outpatient clinical trials as a potential pharmacotherapy for relapse prevention from drug-related cue induced craving.",

        "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by acute and chronic changes in the stress response, manifested as conditioned fear memory. Previously formed memories that are susceptible to disruption immediately after retrieval undergo a protein synthesis-dependent process to become persistent, termed reconsolidation, a process that is regulated by many distinct molecular mechanisms that control gene expression. Increasing evidence supports the participation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB in the different phases of memory. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of NF-\u03baB in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), but not central nucleus of the amygdala, after memory reactivation impairs the retention of amygdala-dependent auditory fear conditioning (AFC). We used two independent pharmacological strategies to disrupt the reconsolidation of AFC. Bilateral intra-BLA infusion of sulfasalazine, an inhibitor of I\u03baB kinase that activates NF-\u03baB, and bilateral intra-BLA infusion of SN50, a direct inhibitor of the NF-\u03baB DNA-binding complex, immediately after retrieval disrupted the reconsolidation of AFC. We also found that systemic pretreatment with sodium butyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor that enhances histone acetylation, in the amygdala rescued the disruption of reconsolidation induced by NF-\u03baB inhibition in the BLA. These findings indicate that NF-\u03baB activity in the BLA is required for memory reconsolidation in AFC, suggesting that NF-\u03baB might be a potential pharmacotherapy target for posttraumatic stress disorder.",

        "abstract": "Protracted opiate withdrawal can extend for months of disrupted hormonal circadian rhythms. We examined rodent behaviors and these circadian disturbances in hormone and peptide levels as well as brain clock gene expression during 60 days of protracted withdrawal. Our behavioral tests included open field, elevated plus maze, and sucrose preference tests at 36 h, 10, 30, and 60 days after stopping chronic morphine. At these four assessment points, we collected samples every 4 h for 24 h to examine circadian rhythms in blood hormone and peptide levels and brain expression of rPER1, rPER2, and rPER3 clock genes. Decreased locomotor activity and elevated adrenocorticotropic hormone and melatonin levels persisted for 2 months after morphine withdrawal, but corticosterone was elevated only at 36 h and 10 days after withdrawal. Orexin levels were high at 36 h after withdrawal, but then reversed during protracted withdrawal to abnormally low levels. Beta-endorphin (\u03b2-EP) levels showed no differences from normal. However, circadian rhythms were blunted for all of these hormones. Corticosterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and orexin blunting persisted at least for 60 days. The blunted circadian rhythm of \u03b2-EP and melatonin recovered by day 60, but the peak phase of \u03b2-EP was delayed about 8 h. Blunted circadian rhythms and reduced expression of rPER1, rPER2, and rPER3 persisted at least for 60 days in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens core, central nucleus of the amygdala, Hippocampus, and ventral tegmental area. Circadian rhythms of rPER1 in the nucleus accumbens shell and basolateral nucleus of the amygdala and of rPER2 in the central nucleus of the amygdala were reversed. Disrupted circadian rhythms of rPER1, rPER 2, and rPER3 expression in reward-related brain circuits and blunted circadian rhythms in peripheral hormones and peptides may play a role in protracted opiate withdrawal and contribute to relapse.",

A previous study showed that oral administration of the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol before memory reactivation in humans erased the behavioral expression of the fear memory 24h later. In this study, we investigated whether propranolol impairs the drug-related memory by disrupting the reconsolidation process in heroin addicts.Seventy abstinent heroin addicts learned a word list (including 10 heroin-related positive words, 10 heroin-related negative words, and 10 neutral words) on day 1. Participants orally administered the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol or placebo before retrieval of the word list on day 2. Free recall of the word list and other psychological and physical responses were assessed on day 3.Oral administration of propranolol before reactivation of the word list impaired reconsolidation of drug-related positive and negative but not neutral words in abstinent heroin addicts, and these impairments critically depended on reactivation of the word list.This study extends earlier reports that a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist affects the drug-related memory reconsolidation process. Our findings may have important implications for the understanding and treatment of persistent and abnormal drug-related memories in abstinent heroin addicts.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the characteristics of the different club drugs and associated high-risk sexual behaviours in China.Multicentre cross-sectional study.Drug Detoxification and Rehabilitation Centres in six provinces, China.A total of 1434 eligible club drug users were included.Participants were investigated by trained interviewers using a self-designed structured questionnaire to collect information on club drug use and associated behaviours.Methamphetamine was the most commonly abused drug in participants (73.92%), who used it in their or their friends' homes by non-injection for the purpose of feeling euphoria. Among participants with sexual behaviours after club drug use, 75.21% reported having engaged in sex with multiple partners after club drug use during the past year and 79.84% had unprotected sex after using club drug during the past year. A two-level logistic model showed that male gender [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=7.14; 95% confidence interval (CI)=4.17-12.5], unmarried (AOR=1.71, 95% CI=1.04-2.79), long duration of club drug use during their life-time (AOR=1.76, 95% CI=1.28-2.42) and severe acute intoxication after using club drugs during the past year (AOR=2.11, 95% CI=1.07-4.15) were independent risk factors of multiple sex partners during the past year. Another two-level model showed that the club drug users who were female (AOR=1.79, 95% CI=1.03-3.11) and had polydrug use during their lifetime (AOR=1.55, 95% CI=1.01-2.34) had more risk for unprotected sex during the past year than without these characteristics.High-risk sexual behaviours are common among club drug users in China. The prevention and intervention of club drug use could decrease the risk of sexual behaviours which further prevent HIV transmission and other sexually transmitted infections in China.",

        "abstract": "Stress is associated with relapse to drugs after abstinence, but the mechanisms for this association are unclear. One mechanism may be that stress enhances abstinent addicts' recall of memories of drugs as stress relievers. This study assessed the effects of stress on free recall and cued recall of 10 heroin-related and 10 neutral words learned 24 h earlier by 102 abstinent heroin addicts. These participants were randomly assigned to three experiments that also assessed attention and working memory. Experiment 1 used a psychosocial stressor (Trier social stress test (TSST)) before testing for recall of heroin-related words. Experiment 2 added administration of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol 1 h before the psychosocial stressor. Experiment 3 added administration of either cortisol with propranolol, cortisol alone, or propranolol alone 1 h before word recall to determine whether stress enhancement of heroin-related word recall required noradrenergic-glucocorticoid interactions. We found that free recall of heroin-related words in abstinent addicts was enhanced after stress or cortisol administration when compared with a non-stress condition or placebo, respectively, whereas these interventions had no effect on neutral word recall. beta-adrenergic blockade blocked the enhancing effect of stress or cortisol on free recall of heroin-related words. Neither stress nor cortisol affected cued recall, attention, or working memory. The potential of beta-adrenergic blockade to reduce or block stress-induced enhancement of drug-related memory retrieval may be relevant to preventing stress-induced relapse in abstinent heroin addicts.",

        "abstract": "Craving is a primary feature of opiate addiction and is clinically significant because of its potential to trigger opiate use and relapse. Opiate use can also produce abnormal pain perception. We predicted that for opiate addicts (OAs), there may be an association between these two major features of addiction (drug craving and abnormal pain responses).To examine pain responses in abstinent opiate addicts in comparison with healthy controls using a cold-pressor test (CPT) and investigate the correlations of cue-induced drug craving with pain responses.Fifty-four abstinent OAs and 46 healthy subjects participated in the CPT, and the OAs were also exposed to heroin-related cues the day before the pain test. Outcome measures included pain-tolerance time, VAS ratings of pain intensity and distress, and (in the cue-exposure procedure) VAS ratings of heroin craving and anxiety.In the CPT, abstinent addicts showed shorter pain-tolerance time (85.1 +/- 14.1 s vs. 133.7 +/- 16.7 s, p < 0.05) and higher ratings of pain distress (61 +/- 3.2 vs. 45.6 +/- 3.2, p < 0.01) compared to healthy controls. When we divided the addicts and controls into pain-sensitive (PS) and pain-tolerant (PT) groups by dichotomizing each group in terms of pain-tolerance time, we again found differences between the two PS groups (37.3 +/- 3.5 s vs. 57.4 +/- 5.1 s, p < 0.01 for pain-tolerance time; 66.7 +/- 3.2 vs. 52.4 +/- 3.3, p < 0.01 for distress ratings). For all participants, pain-tolerance time was negatively correlated with VAS ratings for pain intensity and distress. More importantly, the PS addicts reported greater cue-induced craving than the PT addicts (17.8 +/- 2.2 vs. 4.5 +/- 4.2, p < 0.05). For the addict group as a whole, pain distress (the affective aspect of pain) was positively correlated with intensity of cue-induced craving measured on a different day (r = 0.33, p = 0.01).A hyperalgesic state persists for at least 5 months in abstinent OAs and is predictive of cue-induced craving. Longitudinal research is needed to clarify the direction of causation between hyperalgesia and opiate addiction.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that individuals withdrawn from chronic opiate administration undergo substantial elevations of cortisol levels with blunted corticotropin (ACTH) rhythms and that these changes persist beyond the 7-10 days of acute withdrawal symptoms. However, there are no published studies of changes in expression of clock genes or of other neuropeptides related to circadian-rhythm regulation, which may influence relapse susceptibility.Blood samples were collected from 8 healthy control subjects and 16 heroin addicts during pharmacologically unassisted withdrawal on the 3rd, 10th, and 30th days of abstinence at 3-hour intervals for 24 hours. Outcome measures were the relative expression of clock gene mRNA (hperiod1, hperiod2, hclock) and the levels of serum cortisol, plasma ACTH, beta-endorphin (beta-EP), leptin, neuropeptide Y, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in these subjects.Compared with healthy volunteers, abstinent addicts showed disruptions in diurnal rhythms of hPER1 and hPER2 mRNA expression, along with disruptions in diurnal rhythms of cortisol, ACTH, beta-endorphin, leptin, and IL-2 release. Several of these disruptions (hPER1, hPER2, ACTH, beta-endorphin, and IL-2) persisted for the 30-day testing period, as did elevation of 24-hour levels of cortisol and decreases in 24-hour IL-2 and TNF levels.These prolonged neurobiological changes may play a role in protracted opiate withdrawal symptoms and contribute to relapse vulnerability.",

        "abstract": "Stress and stress hormone are known to play important roles in modulating different stages of memory including reconsolidation. In a previous study, we found that treatment with stress or corticosterone after a single memory reactivation disrupted reconsolidation of a drug-related memory in rats. Here we presumed that stress after memory reactivation can effectively inhibit drug-related memory by disrupting its reconsolidation in abstinent heroin addicts.In the present study, 21 abstinent heroin addicts learned a word list (containing ten neutral, ten heroin-related negative, and ten heroin-related positive words) on day 1; retrieval of a word list (learned 24 h earlier) was made on day 2; and immediately after retrieval, they were exposed to either a standardized psychosocial laboratory stressor (Trier Social Stress Test) or a control condition in a crossover manner. On day 3, free recall of the word list and other psychological and physical responses were assessed.The stressor induced a significant increase in salivary free cortisol and a decrease in mood. Memory recall was significantly impaired after the stress condition. Follow-up analysis revealed that heroin-related negative and positive words (i.e., heroin-related words) were affected, whereas no effect was observed for neutral words. No changes were detected for cued recall, working memory, or attention. Stress after drug-related memory retrieval significantly decreased its subsequent recall, likely through impaired drug-related memory reconsolidation process.Reconsolidation blockade may thus provide a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention of relapse in drug addiction.",

        "abstract": "Drug cues can induce craving for drugs of abuse. Dysfunctional regulation of emotion and motivation regarding rewarding objects appears to be an integral part of addiction. It has been found that cognitive strategies decreased the intensity of craving in addicts. Reappraisal strategy is a type of cognitive strategy that requires participants to reinterpret the meaning of an emotional situation. In addition, studies have found that activation of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) is associated with the selection and application of cognitive reappraisal. In present study, we sought to determine whether such cognitive regulation engages the dACC and improves inhibition of craving in smokers.Sixteen smokers underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during performance of a cigarette reward-conditioning procedure with cognitive reappraisal. We focused our analyses on the dACC as a key structure of cognitive control of craving. Cue induced craving under different conditions was obtained. Correlational analysis between the functional response in the dACC and the subjective craving was performed.We found that using a cognitive reappraisal was successful in decreasing the conditioned craving. Right dACC (BA 24/32) engaged in the cognitive reappraisal. In addition, the individual's subjective craving was negatively correlated with the right dACC activation.These findings suggest that the dACC are important substrates of Inhibition of cue induced craving in smokers. Cognitive regulation by cognitive reappraisal may help addicted individuals avoid the anticipated situations where they are exposed to conditioned cues.",

        "abstract": "Time-dependent increases in cue-induced nicotine and methamphetamine craving during abstinence were recently reported in human drug-dependent individuals. In the present study, we sought to determine whether this 'incubation of craving' phenomenon also occurs in alcoholics. Four groups of 80 inpatient adult male alcoholics were assessed in a single session (between-group design) for cue-induced alcohol craving at 7, 14, 30 and 60 days of abstinence. Another group that included 19 patients was repeatedly tested for cue-induced alcohol craving at the same abstinence days as above. Other psychological and physiological measures were assessed at the four abstinence timepoints. Cue-induced alcohol craving measured with visual analogue scales was the highest at 60 days of abstinence both between and within groups. However, heart rate, blood pressure and skin conductance responses did not differ between abstinent groups. These results provide evidence of the incubation of alcohol craving in humans, extending previous reports with smokers and methamphetamine addicts.",

        "abstract": "Repeated exposure to nicotine increases psychomotor activity. Long-lasting neural plasticity changes that contribute to the nicotine-induced development of locomotor sensitization have been identified. The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling pathway is involved in regulating the neuroplasticity of the central nervous system. In this study, we examined the role of mTORC1 in the amygdala in nicotine-induced locomotor sensitization. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTORC1, was infused into the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and central amygdala (CeA) or systemically administered to investigate the role of the mTORC1 in the development and expression of nicotine-induced locomotor sensitization. We found that locomotor activity progressively increased during the initiation of nicotine-induced locomotor sensitization and the expression of nicotine sensitization was induced by nicotine challenge injection (0.35 mg/kg s.c.) after five days of withdrawal. The initiation of nicotine-induced locomotor sensitization was accompanied by the increased phosphorylated level of mTORC1 downstream target proteins including p-p70s6k and p-4EBP in the BLA, but not CeA. Intra-BLA infusion or systemic administration of rapamycin blocked locomotor activity. Increased p-p70s6k and p-4EBP were also observed in the expression of nicotine sensitization, which was demonstrated to be inhibited by systemic rapamycin administration. Our findings indicated that mTORC1 activity in the BLA, but not the CeA, mediated the initiation and expression of nicotine-induced locomotor sensitization, and may become a potential target for the treatment of nicotine addiction.",

        "abstract": "A recent assessment by the Chinese government showed that sexual transmission is becoming the main mode of spreading human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in China. The annual report on drug abuse demonstrated a seven-fold increase of use of Amphetamine Type Stimulants (ATS), which has been strongly correlated with sexual risk-taking behaviors, in 2007 than that in 2003. These observations suggest that ATS use may have contributed to the rapid increase in sexual transmission of HIV in China.The present study aims to investigate the potential association between new drug users and transmission modes.Partial Least Squares Path Model and Partial Least Squares Regression Models have been used to evaluate the potential correlation between ATS users and the sexual transmission of HIV.Our analysis indicates that HIV infection by drug use mode mainly results from heroin users (R = .5). ATS (R = -.9) and other drug users (R = -.4) have a negative relationship with HIV infection by drug use mode. However, for HIV infection by sexual transmission mode, ATS (R = 5.5) and other drug users (R = .6) show a positive association. ATS, especially, presents a strongly association with the sexual transmission of HIV.The study results suggest that ATS users significantly contribute to the sexual transmission of HIV.It is helpful to evaluate and predict the potential risk factors related with epidemic of HIV in China and provide theoretical evidence for HIV/AIDS health officers and policy makers to better construct target interventions and implement control measures.",

Calcineurin has been suggested to participate in psychostimulant-induced sensitization, but the underlying neurobiological mechanism is poorly understood.This study was designed to examine whether calcineurin activity and its substrates participate in methamphetamine (METH)-induced locomotor sensitization in rats.Two weeks daily METH (1 mg/kg, i.p.) was administrated to rats to induce locomotor sensitization, activity of calcineurin and its substrates Synapsin and glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) were detected. The initiation and expression of locomotor sensitization were tested by inhibition of calcineurin activity systematically or locally in the ventral tegmental area (VTA).Expression of the calcineurin A subunit (catalytic subunit) increased in the VTA but not prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, or hippocampus in rats sensitized to METH. The calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A, systemically administered or microinfused into the VTA, suppressed the initiation but not expression of METH-induced locomotor sensitization. Chronic METH exposure upregulated the expression of the calcineurin A subunit in the VTA, which was negatively associated with downregulation of the phosphorylation of Synapsin and GSK-3\u03b2. Moreover, the related molecular changes were blocked by systemically administered cyclosporine A or microinjections into the VTA.These data elucidate the critical role of calcineurin in the neurobiological mechanism underlying METH-induced locomotor sensitization, suggesting that calcineurin might participate in the initiation of METH-induced locomotor sensitization by negatively regulating the activity of Synapsin and GSK-3\u03b2 in the VTA.",

We recently found that GSK-3\u03b2 activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core is critically involved in cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization. The present study further explored the association between the changes in GSK-3\u03b2 activity in the NAc and the chronic administration of methamphetamine. We also examined whether blocking GSK-3\u03b2 activity in the NAc could alter the initiation and expression of methamphetamine (1 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced locomotor sensitization in rats using systemic administration of lithium chloride (LiCl, 100 mg/kg, i.p) and brain region-specific administration of the GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor SB216763 (1 ng/side). We found that GSK-3\u03b2 activity increased in the NAc core, but not NAc shell, after chronic methamphetamine administration. The initiation and expression of methamphetamine-induced locomotor sensitization was attenuated by systemic administration of LiCl and direct infusion of SB216763 into the NAc core, but not NAc shell. These results indicate that GSK-3\u03b2 activity in the NAc core mediates the initiation and expression of methamphetamine-induced locomotor sensitization, suggesting that GSK-3\u03b2 may be a potential target for the treatment of psychostimulant addiction.",

The master clock of the circadian system in mammals is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) within the anterior hypothalamus, where Per1 and Per2 are essential core components of circadian rhythm oscillation. Chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) is a reliable animal model of depression with good face, predictive, and constructive validity. In the present study, we investigated the effects of CUS on the circadian expression of PER1 and PER2 in the SCN. We found that CUS led to depressive-like behavior and reduced the amplitude of PER2 oscillation in the SCN, which were blocked by 3 weeks of desipramine (DMI) treatment. 2 weeks after termination of CUS, the decreased peak of PER2 expression returned to control levels, whereas depressive-like behavior remained unchanged. Our findings suggest that the dampened amplitude of PER2 expression in the SCN may participate in the development of depressive-like behavior induced by CUS but is unlikely involved in the long-lasting effects of CUS on depressive-like behavior.",

        "abstract": "Objective:Calcineurin is a serine/threonine phosphatase,which can dephosphorylates multiply target proteins,such as calcium channels,AMPA receptors,NMDA receptors,synapsin I,the dopamine-and c-AMP regulated phosphoprotein-32 (DARPP32),and the c-AMP response element-binding protein (CREB),all of which can modulate synaptic plasticity. Repeated stimulant administration an cause increase of spontaneous locomotor,which is referred as the phenomenon of behavioral sensitization. Here,we want to determine the role of calcineurin in methamphetamine-induced locomotor sensitization. Methods:1) whether systemic cyclosporine administration has an effect on the development of methamphetamine-induced locomotor sensitization in rats. SD rats were divided into four groups: saline plus vehicle group,saline plus cyclosporine co-administration group,methamphetamine plus vehicle group,methamphetamine plus cyclosporine co-administration group. Rats were received an intraperitoneal injection of cyclosporine (15 mg\u00b7kg-1) or vehicle 90 min before methamphetamine (1 mg\u00b7kg-1) or saline injection which was followed by 2 h locomotor test for consecutive 14 days. 2) Whether cyclosporine administration pretreatment has an effect on methamphetamine acute injection. Rats were divided into two groups: saline plus vehicle group,saline plus cyclosporine co-administration group. Rats were received an intraperitoneal injection of cyclosporine (15 mg\u00b7kg-1) or vehicle 90 min before saline injection which was followed by 2 h locomotor test for consecutive 14 days. On the day 15 a challenge dose of methamphetamine (1 mg\u00b7kg-1) was given to observe the effect of cyclosporine on the methamphetamine acute injection. 3) Whether micro-infusion the inhibitor of calcineurin in VTA has an effect on the development of methamphetamine-induced locomotor sensitization in rats. Rats were divided into four groups: saline plus vehicle group,saline plus cyclosporine co-administration group,methamphetamine plus vehicle group,methamphetamine plus cyclosporine co-administration group. Rats were received micro-infusion cyclosporine (1 \u03bcg /side) or vehicle 90 min before methamphetamine or saline injection which was followed by 2 h locomotor test for consecutive 14 days (cyclosporine or vehicle were infusion in VTA every other day ). 4) Whether cyclosporine micro-infused in VTA pretreatment has an effect on methamphetamine acute injection. Rats were divided into two groups: saline plus vehicle group,saline plus cyclosporine co-administration group. Rats were received micro-infusion cyclosporine (1 \u03bc g /side) or vehicle 90 min before saline injection which was followed by 2 h locomotor test for consecutive 14 days (cyclosporine or vehicle were infusion in VTA every other day ). On the day 15 a challenge dose of methamphetamine (1 mg\u00b7kg-1) was given to observe the effect of cyclosporine micro-infusion in VTA pretreatment on the methamphetamine acute injection. Results:Systemic cyclosporine administration could inhibit the development of methamphetamine-induced locomotor sensitization in rats,while there were no changes on the locomotor in rats followed by saline injection in the consecutive 14 days after cyclosporine pretreatment. During the day 15 a challenge dose of methamphetamine could significantly increase the locomotor activity in rats,but cyclosporine pretreatment has no effect on the acute methamphetamine injection. Micro-infusion cyclosporine in VTA every other day could also inhibit the development of methamphetamine-induced locomotor sensitization in rats. While micro-infusion cyclosporine in VTA pretreatment had no effect on the acute methamphetamine-induced increased locomotor activity. Conclusion:The activation of calcineurin,especially in VTA,may be involved in the development of methamphetamine-induced locomotor sensitization and plays a critical role in the regulation of synaptic plasticity.",

Methods:Both English databases (EMBASE, PUBMED, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) and Chinese databases (Chinese Biomedical Literatures, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wan Fang, and VIP)were searched, and all reports of relevant clinical trials published from January 1990 to November 2007 were located. Randomized controlled trails (RCTs) of Chinese medicine combined with western medicine in the treatment of opioid detoxification were recruited. Two reviewers reviewed the search hits and assessed the methodological quality independently, and uncertainties were resolved through discussion. Results:Seven RCTs (with 597 patients including 477 heroin dependent patients) were included for Meta-analysis. Combined therapy group scored significantly less than western medicine group in controlling opioid withdrawal symptoms on d9 and d10. WMD and 95% CIs of these two days were:-1.43\\[-2.60, -0.26\\]; -0.30\\[-0.51, -0.09\\]. No significant difference was found during other days of treatment. Combined therapy decreased the dosage of medicine used and showed fewer side effects. Conclusion:Based on current evidence, Chinese medicine combined with western medicine is an effective and safe treatment for opioid detoxification. Well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed.",

In present study, we explored the effect of stress on retrieval of neutral and emotionally valenced (positive and negative) words in abstinent heroin addicts. In present study, 28 male inpatient abstinent heroin addicts and 20 sex-, age-, education- and economic status-matched healthy control participants were assessed for 24h delayed recall of valenced and neutral word lists on two occasions 4 weeks apart-once in a nonstress control condition, once after exposure to the Trier Social Stress Test in a counterbalanced design. In addition, attention, working memory, blood pressure, heart rate and salivary cortisol were assessed. We found acute stress at the time of word list recall enhanced retrieval of positively valenced words, but no effect on negative and neutral word retrieval in abstinent heroin addicts was observed. No changes were detected for attention and working memory. The stressor induced a significant increase in salivary free cortisol, blood pressure and heart rate. Stress can enhance non-drug-related positive memory in abstinent heroin addicts. Our findings will provide richer information in understanding dysregulation of their emotional memory processing under stress and hopefully provide insight into designing improved treatments for drug addiction.",

        "abstract": "The delayed onset of therapeutic outcomes is a major drawback of the current antidepressants. The blood-brain barrier is the most important bottleneck impeding drug transport into the brain. Therefore, development of novel antidepressant medications with rapid onset and sustained activity is urgent. RGD liposomes showed an excellent effect of brain-targeting drug delivery and increased the entering rate to the brain. In the present study, we prepared cyclic RGD liposomes loaded with edaravone (cRGD-ERLs) and evaluated the potential antidepressant-like effects of this drug delivery system in rats. The results showed single injection of cRGD-ERLs produced significant antidepressant-like effects in both forced swim and novelty suppressed feeding test. Moreover, acute cRGD-ERLs increased the expression of c-fos in the medial prefrontal cortex, suggesting that cRGD-ERLs could activate the neuronal function. Furthermore, cRGD-ERLs reversed the increase of lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced plasma cytokine IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, suggesting that normalization of cytokine level might be involved in the behavioral response of cRGD-ERLs. Finally, cRGD-ERLs prevented the increase of immobility induced by LPS in the forced swim test. Overall, the current data revealed a novel brain-target drug delivery system, which can be used to improve the therapeutic outcomes of antidepressants by increase of crossing rate to the brain.",

        "title": "EFFECTS OF STRESS ON DECISION-MAKING IN HEROIN ADDICTS AT DIFFERENT ABSTINENT TIME",
        "abstract": "Objective:The typical clinical characteristics of drug dependence are compulsive drug seeking and drug taking. Evidences from clinical studies suggest that the craving for addictive substance of drug addicts keeps out of self-control even after long-term withdrawal,while the physiological symptoms might have disappeared for months or years. They perform with little or inadequate forethought and then continue drug taking. It has been proved that stress can induce drug craving. But there are rare studies on effects of stress on impulsive choice of heroin addicts at different abstinent time. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of stress on decision-making in heroin addicts at different abstinent time. Methods:In the present study,we assessed decision-making performance in heroin addicts at different abstinent time by Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). The subjects provided written informed consent before testing. All subjects were 20 to 45 years old and heroin addicts had to be with a DSM-\u2163 diagnosis of substance dependence to opiates. All subjects completed HAMA,BDI,BIS questionnaires and tests of attention and working memory. The subjects who had been drug free for 15 d,30 d,3 months,12 months,24 months and matched control were challenged with the Trial Social Stress Test (TSST) or a control condition to test the effects of stress on decision-making performance in a counterbalance design. Blood pressure,heart rate,differential emotion and salivary cortisol were monitored at pre-CONTROL,post-CONTROL,pre-TSST and post-TSST test time points. The subjects who had been drug free for 30 d,12 months and 24 months were randomly assigned to placebo or 40 mg propranolol. One hour after administration of placebo or propranolol orally,heroin addicts were challenged with the TSST or a control condition in a counterbalance design. Blood pressure,heart rate,differential emotion and salivary cortisol were monitored at time points described above. Results:The enhancement of decision-making performance after stress exposure was found in all heroin groups,but not in normal control group. In addition,this enhancement was blocked by 40 mg propranolol in 30 d,12 months and 24 months groups. Conclusion:The present study displayed that stress enhanced the impulsive choice in heroin addicts after withdrawal from drug taking,and the enhancement of stress induced could be blocked by propranolol. These findings have implications for behavioral and pharmacological interventions targeting impaired decision-making in heroin addiction.",

The critical problem in drug dependence is repeated relapse even after detoxification. We have been contributed to the research of neurobiological mechanisms, clinical characteristics, and interventions of craving after withdrawal from addicting drugs. We have systematically studied the change of drug seeking behavior and craving after withdrawal from cocaine, and further investigated the neural anatomic pathway, long-term neuroplasticity, and neural signal pathways which involved in the change of drug seeking behavior. According to the situation of drug abuse in China, we investigated the characteristics in the expression of incubation of craving after withdrawal from opiate. We have primarily found the neural anatomic pathways and neural plasticity mechanisms which contribute to the process. We have also demonstrated the psychological characteristics and neurobiological mechanisms of craving induced by opiate and its long-term maintenance resulting from learning and memory, chronobiology and imaging. Our findings have provided evidence for effective inventions on preventing relapse after abstinence in addicts.",

        "abstract": "Background:The capacity of alcohol cues to precipitate the desire to drink may be an important determinant of relapse to alcohol use in recovering alcohol-dependent patients. Serotonin and dopamine may play a role in the craving induced by alcohol cues. Acute tryptophan (Trp),phenylalanine/tyrosine (Phe/Tyr) depletion can canse attenuate of serotonin and dopamine synthesis in the human brain. There were no significant changes in the magnitude of cue-induced craving with active tryptophan depletion compared with placebo in abstinent alcoholic patients. But,compared to the Blance mixture,Phe/Tyr-free,but not Trp-free,significantly decreased the ingestion of alcohol in healthy women. Objective:This study investigated whether attenuation of serotonin and dopamine synthesis via depletion of their precursors tryptophan,tyrosine,and phenylalanine reduced the magnitude of cue-induced alcohol urging for alcohol in recently abstinent alcoholic male individuals in China. Methods:The study was a double-blind,randomized,placebo controlled,crossover design in which 12 male patients with alcohol dependence in China who met the criteria of ICD-10 and DSM-\u2163completed the experiment under two acute treatment conditions: (a) administration of a concentrated amino acid drink that resulted in a rapid and significant decline in plasma free tyrosine/phenylalanine/ tryptophan (active depletion,no tyrosine/phenylalanine/ tryptophan supplementation),and (b) administration of a similar drink containing tyrosine/phenylalanine/tryptophan (placebo depletion),with administrations at least 7 days apart. The primary outcomes were subject\u2019s ratings on questionnaires of drinking urge,anxiety-VAS(visual analog scales),and depressive-VAS. Blood pressure and heart rate were also measured before and after administration of amino acid drink. Finally,a cue-testing session was carried out 6 hours after each amino acid drink administration.Results:Compared to the placebo depletion,active depletion significantly increased the intention/desire to drinking (P=0.0217)and diastolic blood pressure(P=0.038),regardless of in the condition of alcohol-related cue exposure or no alcohol-related cue exposure,without significant differentce in the scales of anxiety-VAS,depressive-VAS,systolic blood pressure,and heart rate. With the exception of one participant who experienced diarrhea,few adverse side effects were reported and these were generally mild. Mild to moderate side effects were: nausea,dry mouth,dizziness,and tired feeling. Conclusions:The results suggest that acute depletion of their precursores tyrosine,tryptophan,and phenylalanine may increase the intention/desire to drinking and diastolic blood pressure.",

        "abstract": "Schizophrenic patients have higher smoking rates than the general population. Studies show that smoking may be a form of self-medication in an attempt to alleviate cognitive deficits in schizophrenic patients of European background. This study examined the relationships between smoking and cognitive deficits in Chinese schizophrenic patients, which have previously received little systemic study. We recruited 580 male chronic patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and 175 male control subjects who were matched on age and education. The subjects completed a detailed cigarette smoking questionnaire, the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND), and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Patients also were rated on the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), the Simpson and Angus Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (SAES), and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). All five RBANS subscales except for the Visuospatial/Constructional index showed significantly lower cognitive performance for schizophrenics than normal controls. The schizophrenic smokers scored lower than the schizophrenic non-smokers on the RBANS total score and the Visuospatial/Constructional and Immediate Memory indices. Similarly, the control smokers scored lower than the control non-smokers on the RBANS total score and the Immediate Memory index. Also, the schizophrenic smokers consistently performed the poorest on the cognitive domains of the RBANS. Among the schizophrenic patients, smokers displayed significantly fewer negative symptoms than non-smokers. Using multivariate regression analysis the following variables were independently associated with the RBANS total score: years of education, PANSS negative symptom score, age at schizophrenia onset, and number of hospitalizations. Our results show that smoking is associated with significant cognitive impairment in both schizophrenic patients and normal controls, but the smokers with schizophrenia had a reduced level of negative symptoms, suggesting that the benefits of smoking for those with schizophrenia may be limited to certain aspects of a given clinical phenotype. \u00a9 2012 Zhang et al.",

The outcome measures included the relative expression of clock gene mRNA PERIOD1 (PER1), PERIOD2 (PER2), PERIOD3 (PER3) and the levels of plasma cortisol, orexin, and insulin.Compared with healthy controls, schizophrenia patients presented disruptions in diurnal rhythms of the expression of PER1, PER3, and NPAS2 and the release of orexin, accompanied by a delayed phase in the expression of PER2, decreases in PER3 and NPAS2 expression, and an increase in cortisol levels at baseline. Several of these disruptions (i.e., in PER1 and PER3 expression) persisted after 8 weeks of clozapine treatment, similar to the decreases in the 24-h expression of PER3 and NPAS2. Clozapine treatment for 8 weeks significantly decreased the 24-h levels of PER2 and increased the 24-h levels of insulin.These persistent neurobiological changes that occur after 8 weeks of clozapine treatment may contribute to the vulnerability to recurrence and efficacy of long-term maintenance treatment in schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "The intense associative memories that develop between drug-paired contextual cues and rewarding stimuli or the drug withdrawal-associated aversive feeling have been suggested to contribute to the high rate of relapse. Various studies have elucidated the mechanisms underlying the formation and expression of drug-related cue memories, but how this mechanism is maintained is unknown. Protein kinase M \u03b6 (PKM\u03b6) was recently shown to be necessary and sufficient for long-term potentiation maintenance and memory storage. In the present study, we used conditioned place preference (CPP) and aversion (CPA) to examine whether PKM\u03b6 maintains both morphine-associated reward memory and morphine withdrawal-associated aversive memory in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). We also investigate the role of PKM\u03b6 in the infralimbic cortex in the extinction memory of morphine reward-related cues and morphine withdrawal-related aversive cues. We found that intra-BLA but not central nucleus of the amygdala injection of the selective PKM\u03b6 inhibitor ZIP 1 day after CPP and CPA training impaired the expression of CPP and CPA 1 day later, and the effect of ZIP on memory lasted at least 2 weeks. Inhibiting PKM\u03b6 activity in the infralimbic cortex, but not prelimbic cortex, disrupted the expression of the extinction memory of CPP and CPA. These results indicate that PKM\u03b6 in the BLA is required for the maintenance of associative morphine reward memory and morphine withdrawal-associated aversion memory, and PKM\u03b6 in the infralimbic cortex is required for the maintenance of extinction memory of morphine reward-related cues and morphine withdrawal-related aversive cues.",

        "abstract": "Heroin use has seriously threatened public heath in many countries, but the existing therapies continue to have many limitations. Recently, immunotherapy has shown efficacy in some clinical studies, including vaccines against nicotine and cocaine, but no opioid vaccines have been introduced in clinical studies. The development of a novel opioid antigen designed specifically for the prevention of heroin addiction is necessary. A morphine-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate was prepared and administered subcutaneously in rats. Antibody titers in plasma were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Competitive ELISA was used to assess the selectivity of the antibodies. Dopamine concentrations in the nucleus accumbens in rats after vaccine administration were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. The effects of the vaccine on the heroin-primed restatement of self-administration and locomotor sensitization were evaluated. A novel hapten, 6-glutarylmorphine, was produced, and the vaccine generated a high antibody titer response. This vaccine displayed specificity for both morphine and heroin, but the anti-morphine antibodies could not recognize dissimilar therapeutic opioid compounds, such as buprenorphine, methadone, naloxone, naltrexone, codeine, and nalorphine. The morphine antibody significantly decreased morphine-induced locomotor activity in rats after immunization. Importantly, rats immunized with this vaccine did not exhibit heroin-primed reinstatement of heroin seeking when antibody levels were sufficiently high. The vaccine reduced dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens after morphine administration, which is consistent with its behavioral effects. These results suggest that immunization with a novel vaccine is an effective means of inducing a morphine-specific antibody response that is able to attenuate the behavioral and psychoactive effects of heroin.",

        "abstract": "Drug addiction is a chronic brain disorder with the hallmark of a high rate of relapse to compulsive drug seeking and drug taking even after long-term abstinence. Addiction has been considered as an aberrant memory that has been termed \"addiction memory.\" Drug-related memory plays a critical role in the maintenance of learned addictive behaviors and emergence of relapse. Disrupting these long-lasting memories by administering amnestic agents or other manipulations during specific phases of drug memory is a promising strategy for relapse prevention. Recent studies on the processes of drug addiction and relapse have demonstrated that the amygdala is involved in associative drug addiction learning processes. In this review, we focus on preclinical studies that used conditioned place preference and self-administration models to investigate the differential roles of the amygdala in each phase of drug-related memory, including acquisition, consolidation, retrieval, reconsolidation, and extinction. These studies indicate that the amygdala plays a critical role in both cue-associative learning and the expression of cue-induced relapse to drug-seeking behavior.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have indicated that the immune may be involved in the pathogenesis of tardive dyskinesia (TD). Some genetic polymorphisms in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) I and II regions have been associated with TD, and the tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) gene is located in the HLA III region. TNF-\u03b1 levels in the striatum significantly increased in haloperidol-induced TD in rats. The TNF-\u03b1 gene -308A/G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been shown to directly influence TNF-\u03b1 expression. The genetic association between the TNF-\u03b1 gene -308A/G SNP and TD is unclear. The present study investigated whether this variation is associated with clinical phenotypes and TD in schizophrenia in a genetically homogeneous northern Chinese Han population.We genotyped the TNF-\u03b1 gene -308A/G SNP in patients with schizophrenia with TD (n=350) and without TD (n=410). The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were used to assess the severity of TD and psychopathology of schizophrenia, respectively.The allele and genotype frequencies did not significantly differ between patients with schizophrenia with and without TD (p>0.05). No significant difference was found in the total AIMS score between the genotypes (p>0.05). However, the PANSS negative symptom subscore was associated with risk for TD (p=0.004), and a significant difference was found in total AIMS score between the genotypes in TD patients (p=0.013).The TNF-\u03b1 gene -308A/G polymorphism does not appear to play a major role in the susceptibility to TD in patients with schizophrenia in a northern Chinese Han population. However this polymorphism may play a role in the TD severity.",

Here, we showed that inhibition of IKK/NF-\u03baB by sulphasalazine (SSZ; 10 mM, i.c.v.) selectively blocked the extinction but not acquisition or expression of morphine-induced CPA in rats. The blockade of CPA extinction induced by SSZ was abolished by sodium butyrate, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase.

        "abstract": "The intense associative memories that develop between drug-paired contextual cues and rewarding stimuli or the drug withdrawal-associated aversive feeling have been suggested to contribute to the high rate of relapse. Various studies have elucidated the mechanisms underlying the formation and expression of drug-related cue memories, but how this mechanism is maintained is unknown. Protein kinase M \u03b6 (PKM\u03b6) was recently shown to be necessary and sufficient for long-term potentiation maintenance and memory storage. In the present study, we used conditioned place preference (CPP) and aversion (CPA) to examine whether PKM\u03b6 maintains both morphine-associated reward memory and morphine withdrawal-associated aversive memory in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). We also investigate the role of PKM\u03b6 in the infralimbic cortex in the extinction memory of morphine reward-related cues and morphine withdrawal-related aversive cues. We found that intra-BLA but not central nucleus of the amygdala injection of the selective PKM\u03b6 inhibitor ZIP 1 day after CPP and CPA training impaired the expression of CPP and CPA 1 day later, and the effect of ZIP on memory lasted at least 2 weeks. Inhibiting PKM\u03b6 activity in the infralimbic cortex, but not prelimbic cortex, disrupted the expression of the extinction memory of CPP and CPA. These results indicate that PKM\u03b6 in the BLA is required for the maintenance of associative morphine reward memory and morphine withdrawal-associated aversion memory, and PKM\u03b6 in the infralimbic cortex is required for the maintenance of extinction memory of morphine reward-related cues and morphine withdrawal-related aversive cues.",

        "abstract": "Maladaptive memories elicited by exposure to environmental stimuli associated with drugs of abuse are often responsible for relapse among addicts. Interference with the reconsolidation of drug memory can inhibit drug seeking. Previous studies have indicated that the dephosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 \u03b1-subunit (eIF2\u03b1) plays an important role in synaptic plasticity and long-term memory consolidation, but its role in the reconsolidation of drug memory remains unknown. The amygdala is required for the reconsolidation of a destabilized drug memory after retrieval of drug-paired stimuli. Here, we used conditioned place preference (CPP) and self-administration procedures to determine whether amygdala eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation is required for the reconsolidation of morphine and cocaine memories in rats. We found that the levels of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (Ser51) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) were decreased after reexposure to a previously morphine- or cocaine-paired context (i.e., a memory retrieval procedure) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) but not in the central amygdala. Intra-BLA infusions of Sal003, a selective inhibitor of eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation, immediately after memory retrieval disrupted the reconsolidation of morphine- or cocaine-induced CPP, leading to a long-lasting suppression of drug-paired stimulus-induced craving. Advanced knockdown of ATF4 expression in the BLA by lentivirus-mediated short-hairpin RNA blocked the disruption of the reconsolidation of morphine-induced CPP induced by Sal003 treatment. Furthermore, inhibition of eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation in the BLA immediately after light/tone stimulus retrieval decreased subsequent cue-induced heroin-seeking behavior in the self-administration procedure. These results demonstrate that eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation in the BLA mediates the memory reconsolidation of drug-paired stimuli.",

        "abstract": "Depression is one of the most common and debilitating psychiatric illnesses around the world, but the current antidepressants used to treat depression have many limitations. Progressively more studies have shown that neuropeptide systems are potential novel therapeutic targets for depression. However, whether the neuropeptide trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) participates in the development of depression has not been examined. In the current experiments, we assessed the antidepressant effects of TFF3 using the forced swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), and chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm. Furthermore, we determined the mechanism that underlies the antidepressant-like effects of TFF3 in the rat FST. TFF3 dose-dependently reduced immobility time in both FST and TST. CMS elevated plasma TFF3 and decreased basolateral amygdala (BLA) TFF3 levels in rats, and acute TFF3 (0.1\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) treatment reversed the depressive-like behaviors induced by CMS. Furthermore, TFF3 (0.1\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) significantly increased Fos expression in the BLA, medial prefrontal cortex, and hypothalamus in rats subjected to the FST. Intra-BLA infusions of TFF3 (1\u2009ng/side) exerted rapid antidepressant-like effects in the rat FST. Additionally, acute systemic TFF3 administration increased the level of phosphorylated-Akt (p-Akt) in the BLA. Finally, intra-BLA infusions of LY294002 (5\u2009mM/side), a specific phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, significantly blocked the antidepressant-like effect of TFF3. Our results demonstrated that TFF3 exerts antidepressant-like effects that might be mediated by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in the BLA. These findings suggest a novel neuropeptide system target in the development of new antidepressants.",

        "abstract": "Stress in adolescence has been widely demonstrated to have a lasting impact in humans and animal models. Developmental risk and protective factors play an important role in the responses to stress in adulthood. Mild-to-moderate stress in adolescence may resist the negative impacts of adverse events in adulthood. However, little research on resilience has been conducted. In this study, we used a predictable chronic mild stress (PCMS) procedure (5\u2009min of daily restraint stress for 28 days) in adolescent rats (postnatal days (PNDs) 28-55) to test the resilience effect of PCMS on depressive-like behavior in the sucrose preference test and forced swim test and anxiety-like behavior in the novelty-suppressed feeding test and elevated plus maze in adulthood. We also investigated the role of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in the brain during the PCMS procedure in adolescence. Moreover, we investigated the effect of PCMS in adolescence on subsequent responses to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS; PNDs 63-83) in adulthood. The results demonstrated that PCMS during adolescence produced antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects and increased mTOR signaling activity in the prefrontal cortex in early adulthood. Either systemic administration or intra-PFC infusion of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin completely blocked the behavioral effects produced by PCMS in adolescence. PCMS during adolescence resisted depressive- and anxiety-like behavior caused by CUS in adulthood. These findings indicate that PCMS in adolescence can contribute to resilience against depression and anxiety caused by stress in adulthood.",

They were given oral methadone (maximum daily dose 80 mg, minimum daily dose 30 mg). Opioid use was assessed by twice-weekly urinalysis; HIV and HCV status were assessed by standard blood tests. Questionnaires were administered to assess blood-borne-virus risk behavior, severity of dependence, depression, health status, employment, and criminal activity. Changes over time were evaluated by 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc t tests.: Opioid use was reduced from 26.7 days per month at baseline to 0.7 and 0.0 days at 3 and 6 months, respectively. No participant seroconverted to HIV and HCV positivity during the 6 months of MMT. Health status significantly improved, as did severity of dependence, depression, and criminal activity, after 3 and 6 months MMT.: The results support the broad beneficial effects of MMT in China.",

        "title": "EFFECTS OF DRUG RELATED CUE ON DECISION-MAKING IN HEROIN ADDICTS AT DIFFERENT ABSTINENT TIME",
        "abstract": "Objective:Clinical descriptions of addiction emphasize the importance of repeated attempts to quit drug use and continued drug-taking despite awareness of the negative consequences. Evidences from clinical studies suggest that the craving for addictive substance of drug addicts keeps out of self-control even after long-term withdrawal,while the physiological symptoms might have disappeared for months or years. It has been proved that drug related cue can induce higher drug craving. But there are rare studies on effects of drug related cue on impulsive choice of heroin addicts at different abstinent time. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of drug related cue on decision-making in heroin addicts at different abstinent time. Methods:In the present study,we used Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) to assess decision-making in chronic heroin addicts and investigate the effects of drug related cue on impulsive choice. The subjects provided written informed consent before testing. All subjects were 20 to 45 years old,with a DSM-\u2163 diagnosis of substance dependence to opiates and had been drug free for 30 d,3 months,12 months,24 months. All subjects completed HAMA,BDI,Barratt questionnaires and tests of attention and working memory. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored at pre-CONTROL,post-CONTROL,pre-CUE and post-CUE tested time points. And the subjects were required to rate differential emotion state and craving score at four time points. At each tested time point we used Iowa Gambling Task to assess decision-making. Results:The study found that both the short-term and long-term abstinent subjects had higher impulsive scores after exposure to effective drug related cue . There was significant difference at pre-CUE and post-CUE time point. Conclusion:The present study displayed that drug related cue enhanced the impulsive choice in heroin addicts at different abstinent time. It makes contributions to solve compulsive drug taking and prevent relapse. The neural mechanisms underlying the enhancement of impulsive choice of drug related cue on heroin addicts at different abstinent time need to be explored deeply.",

        "abstract": "Alcohol cues can precipitate the desire to drink and cause relapse in recovering alcohol-dependent patients. Serotonin and dopamine may play a role in alcohol cue-induced craving. Acute combined tryptophan (Trp), tyrosine (Tyr), and phenylalanine (Phe) depletion (CMD) in the diet attenuates the synthesis of serotonin and dopamine in the human brain. However, no study of the effects of acute CMD has been previously conducted. Therefore, we investigated whether the attenuation of serotonin and dopamine synthesis changes cue-induced alcohol craving in recently abstinent alcoholics.In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 12 male patients who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, criteria for alcohol dependence were divided into two conditions: (1) monoamine depletion (i.e., consumption of a concentrated amino acid beverage that resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in plasma-free Tyr/Phe/Trp) and (2) balanced condition (i.e., consumption of a similar beverage that contained Tyr/Phe/Trp). The participants were scheduled for two experimental sessions, with an interval of \u22657 days. The cue-induced craving test session was conducted 6h after each amino acid beverage administration. Drinking urge, blood pressure, heart rate, working memory, and attention/psychomotor performance were assessed before and after administration.Compared with the balanced condition, the monoamine depletion condition significantly increased drinking intention/desire and diastolic blood pressure. Cognitive performance was not different between the two conditions.Acute combined serotonin and dopamine depletion may increase drinking intention/desire and diastolic blood pressure without influencing cognitive function.",

        "abstract": "Glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists exert fast-acting antidepressant effects, providing a promising way to develop a new classification of antidepressant that targets the glutamatergic system. In the present study, we examined the potential antidepressant action of 7-chlorokynurenic acid (7-CTKA), a glycine recognition site NMDA receptor antagonist, in a series of behavioural models of depression and determined the molecular mechanisms that underlie the behavioural actions of 7-CTKA.We administered the forced swim test, novelty-suppressed feeding test, learned helplessness paradigm and chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm in male rats to evaluate the possible rapid antidepressant-like actions of 7-CTKA. In addition, we assessed phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (p-GSK3\u03b2) level, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) function, and postsynaptic protein expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus.Acute 7-CTKA administration produced rapid antidepressant-like actions in several behavioural tests. It increased p-GSK3\u03b2, enhanced mTOR function and increased postsynaptic protein levels in the mPFC. Activation of GSK3\u03b2 by LY294002 completely blocked the antidepressant-like effects of 7-CTKA. Moreover, 7-CTKA did not produce rewarding properties or abuse potential.It is possible that 7-CTKA modulates glutamatergic transmission, thereby causing enduring alterations of GSK3\u03b2 and mTOR signalling, although we did not provide direct evidence to support this possibility. Thus, the therapeutic involvement of synaptic adaptions engaged by 7-CTKA requires further study.Our findings demonstrate that acute 7-CTKA administration produced rapid antidepressant-like effects, indicating that the behavioural response to 7-CTKA is mediated by GSK3\u03b2 and mTOR signalling function in the mPFC.",

        "abstract": "Drug abuse is associated with substantial impairments in decision making. However, little is known about the time course of changes in decision-making ability after abstinence or about the effects of stress on decision making in individuals recovering from heroin dependence after different durations of abstinence.First, the authors assessed decision-making performance with the original card version of the Iowa Gambling Task in formerly heroin-dependent patients who had been abstinent for 3, 7, 15, or 30 days or 3, 6, 12, or 24 months. Second, patients who had been abstinent from heroin for 15 or 30 days or 3, 12, or 24 months were challenged with acute stress induced by the Trier Social Stress Test. Third, the \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (40 mg) was administered 1 hour before stress to those who had been abstinent for 30 days or 12 or 24 months.The short-term abstinence groups (3-30 days) performed worse on the Iowa Gambling Task compared with the long-term abstinence groups (3-24 months). Psychosocial stress unmasked a latent impairment in decision making in the 24-month abstinence group, which seemed to perform identically to healthy comparison subjects in the absence of stress. Propranolol blocked the stress-induced impairment of decision making, which was seen only in the formerly heroin-dependent patients.Stress can exacerbate an already existing impairment of decision making or unmask a latent one in individuals recovering from heroin dependence. The \u03b2-adrenergic blockade reduces this effect and might hold promise for treatment of substance use disorders.",

Since the reemergence of drug abuse in China in the 1980s, the number of drug addicts has increased dramatically, especially the proportion of users of synthetic drugs, such as amphetamine-type stimulant (ATS). Further, the proportion of opiate addicts has decreased among the new initiates. This review describes the new pattern of drug abuse and the resultant intervention strategy in China.The demographics regarding drug abuse in China point to a trend of younger users, and indicate that Internet and telephone are facilitating drug trafficking. Furthermore, polydrug use is common. Many heroin addicts have used ATS and other synthetic drugs, and some synthetic drug abusers have used opiate drugs too. HIV infection and psychosis comorbidity are primarily associated with drug abuse in China.Although opiate drug use and its associated harm have been controlled effectively in some areas, the synthetic drugs and new designer drugs have complicated the drug abuse scene. A national system of management and intervention for synthetic drugs and associated diseases urgently needs to be established in China.",

        "abstract": "Nicotine craving and relapse often occurs after reactivation of nicotine reward memories. We recently developed a memory retrieval-reconsolidation interference procedure in which reactivating nicotine reward memories by acute exposure to nicotine (the unconditioned stimulus [UCS]) and then pharmacologically interfering with memory reconsolidation decreased relapse to nicotine seeking in rats and nicotine craving in smokers. Here, we investigated underlying mechanisms.In the first series of experiments, we trained rats for nicotine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) or nicotine self-administration and ventricularly microinjected them with the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin immediately after UCS-induced memory retrieval. In the second series of experiments, we used tyramide-amplified immunohistochemistry-fluorescence in situ hybridization to examine neural ensembles in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) reactivated by nicotine conditioned stimulus- or UCS-induced memory retrieval. We then used the Daun02 chemogenetic inactivation procedure to selectively inhibit the nicotine UCS-reactivated BLA neuronal ensembles.Ventricular injections of the anisomycin immediately after nicotine UCS memory retrieval inhibited subsequent nicotine CPP and relapse to operant nicotine seeking after short or prolonged abstinence. More important, within BLA, distinct neuronal ensembles encoded pavlovian CPP and operant self-administration reward memories and nicotine (the UCS) injections in the home cage reactivated both neuronal ensembles. Daun02 chemogenetic inactivation of the nicotine-reactivated ensembles inhibited both nicotine CPP and relapse to nicotine seeking.Results demonstrate that the nicotine UCS-induced memory retrieval manipulation reactivates multiple nicotine reward memories that are encoded by distinct BLA neuronal ensembles that play a role in nicotine preference and relapse.",

        "abstract": "Strong links exist between circadian disturbances and some of the most characteristic symptoms of clinical major depressive disorder (MDD). However, changes in the expression of clock genes or neuropeptides related to the regulation of circadian rhythm that may influence the susceptibility to recurrence after antidepressant treatment in MDD have not been investigated.Blood samples were collected at 4h intervals for 24h from 12 male healthy controls and 12 male MDD patients before and after treatment with escitalopram for 8 weeks. The outcome measures included the relative expression of clock gene mRNA (PERIOD1, PERIOD2, PERIOD3, CRY1, BMAL1, NPAS2, and GSK-3\u03b2), and the levels of serum melatonin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and growth hormone (GH).Compared with healthy controls, MDD patients showed disruptions in the diurnal rhythms of the expression of PERIOD1, PERIOD2, CRY1, BMAL1, NPAS2, and GSK-3\u03b2 and disruptions in the diurnal rhythms of the release of melatonin, VIP, cortisol, ACTH, IGF-1, and GH. Several of these disruptions (i.e., PER1, CRY1, melatonin, VIP, cortisol, ACTH, and IGF-1) persisted 8 weeks after escitalopram treatment, similar to the increase in the 24h levels of VIP and decreases in the 24h levels of cortisol and ACTH.These persistent neurobiological changes may play a role in MDD symptoms that are thought to contribute to the vulnerability to recurrence and long-term maintenance therapy.",

        "abstract": "The persistence of physical dependence and craving in addicts is considered to contribute to relapse. Increasing evidence indicates that neuropeptide systems are associated with several phases of drug addiction, but little is known about whether the neuropeptide trefoil factor affects withdrawal symptoms.This study aims to investigate the potential effects of the neuropeptide trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) on naloxone-precipitated withdrawal symptoms in morphine-dependent mice.Mice received increasing doses of morphine over 3\u00a0days. On day 4, the mice were injected with TFF3 (1.0\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) 30\u00a0min after the last dose of morphine. Thirty minutes after TFF3 treatment, naloxone (1\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) was injected, and body weight, jumping behavior, wet-dog shakes, and locomotor activity were assessed 30\u00a0min later. Naloxone caused significant weight loss and increased jumping behavior and wet-dog shakes in morphine-dependent mice. TFF3 (1.0\u00a0mg/kg) reversed these behavioral symptoms caused by morphine withdrawal, suggesting that TFF3 might ameliorate physical dependence associated with opiate addiction. Furthermore, TFF3 pretreatment significantly reduced morphine withdrawal-induced increases in plasma corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels. The glucocorticoid receptor agonist RU486 blocked the behavioral effects of TFF3 on morphine withdrawal symptoms. Finally, Fos expression in the medial prefrontal cortex which was decreased during morphine withdrawal was increased by TFF3 pretreatment.These findings indicate that TFF3 might be a potential therapeutic candidate for opiate addiction by regulating glucocorticoid secretion and neuronal activation in the prefrontal cortex.",

        "abstract": "Heroin use and withdrawal cause abnormality in the endocrine system. However, the time course of neuroendocrine alterations in heroin addicts during pharmacologically unassisted withdrawal is still unclear.To investigate alterations in cortisol, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), beta-endorphin (beta-EP), leptin, and neuropeptide Y (NPY) during the first month of abstinence in heroin addicts.Twelve heroin addicts and eight matched healthy control subjects were recruited for this study. The neuroendocrine alterations and self-reported heroin craving, anxiety, and depression in heroin addicts were assessed at different time points (days 3, 10, and 30) of first month of abstinence from heroin use.Self-reported heroin craving, anxiety, and depression in heroin addicts decreased gradually during the first month of abstinence. The cortisol levels increased from abstinence day 3 to 30, while ACTH and beta-EP levels decreased over this period in heroin addicts. The leptin and NPY levels were significantly decreased on days 3 and 10 but had normalized on day 30 of abstinence. A positive correlation between cortisol level and heroin craving, anxiety, and depression was observed, while a negative correlation was observed between beta-EP level and craving and anxiety and between leptin and depression and NPY and anxiety.Abnormal alterations in the neuroendocrine system, including levels of cortisol, ACTH and beta-EP persist throughout the first month of abstinence. These results suggest that neuroendocrine system dysfunctions in heroin abusers is independent of the acute and protracted withdrawal syndromes, and may thus contribute to relapse to heroin use.",

        "abstract": "Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) is a ubiquitous serine/threonine protein kinase involved in a number of signaling pathways. Previous studies have demonstrated a role for GSK-3beta in the synaptic plasticity underlying dopamine-associated behaviors and diseases. Drug sensitization is produced by repeated exposure to the drug and is thought to reflect neuroadaptations that contribute to addiction. However, the role of GSK-3beta in cocaine-induced behavior sensitization has not been examined. The present study investigated the effects of chronic cocaine exposure on GSK-3beta activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and determined whether changes in GSK-3beta activity in the NAc are associated with cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. We also explored whether blockade of GSK-3beta activity in the NAc inhibits the initiation and expression of cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization in rats using systemic or brain region-specific administration of the GSK-3beta inhibitors lithium chloride (LiCl) and SB216763. GSK-3beta activity in the NAc core, but not NAc shell, increased after chronic cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) administration. The initiation and expression of cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization was attenuated by systemic administration of LiCl (100 mg/kg, i.p.) or direct infusion of SB216763 (1 ng/side) into the NAc core, but not NAc shell. Collectively, these results indicate that GSK-3beta activity in the NAc core, but not NAc shell, mediates the initiation and expression of cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization, suggesting that GSK-3beta may be a potential target for the treatment of cocaine addiction.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To assess the effectiveness and safety of Chinese medicine in the treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms.Methods:Both English and Chinese databases were searched for randomized trials comparing Chinese herbal medicine to either \u03b12-adrenergic agonists or opioid agonists for heroin detoxification.The methodological quality of each study was assessed with Jadad's scale.Meta analysis was performed with fixed-or random-effect models in RevMan software;outcome measures assessed were withdrawal-symptoms score,anxiety,and adverse effects of treatment.Results:Twenty-one studies(2949 participants) were included.For withdrawal symptoms score relieving during the 10-day observation,Chinese herbal medicine was superior to \u03b12-adrenergic agonists in relieving opioid-withdrawal symptoms during 4-10 days(except d8) and no difference was found within the first 3 days.Compared with opioid agonists,Chinese herbal medicine was inferior during the first 3 days,but the difference became non-significant during d 4-9.Chinese herbal medicine has better effect on anxiety relieving at late stage of intervention than \u03b12-adrenergic agonists,and no difference with opioid agonists.The incidence of some adverse effects(fatigue,dizziness) was significantly lower for Chinese herbal medicine than for \u03b12-adrenergic agonists(sufficient data for comparison with opioid agonists were not available).Findings were robust to file-drawer effects.Conclusion:Our Meta analysis suggests that Chinese herbal medicine is an effective and safety treatment for heroin detoxification.And more work is needed to determine the specific effects of specific forms of Chinese herbal medicine.",

        "abstract": "Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a neurotoxin found in puffer fish and other marine animals. New clinical studies suggest that low-dose TTX can safely relieve severe, treatment-resistant cancer pain. The therapeutic potential of TTX in addiction is supported by studies in laboratory animals. The purpose of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to assess the effect of a single intramuscular dose of TTX on cue-induced craving and anxiety in abstinent heroin addicts.Forty-five abstinent heroin addicts were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: placebo, 5 microg TTX, or 10 microg TTX. Participants were exposed to a neutral video or a heroin-related video. Craving, anxiety, blood pressure, and heart rate were measured pre- and post-exposure.Heroin-related cues increased both craving and anxiety and had no effect on blood pressure and heart rate. A single dose of TTX dose-dependently attenuated the increases in craving and anxiety while having no effect on blood pressure or heart rate.The results suggest that low-dose TTX is acutely effective in reducing cue-induced increases in heroin craving and associated anxiety.",

        "abstract": "Depression is one of the most pervasive and debilitating psychiatric diseases, and the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of depression have not been elucidated. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) has been implicated in synaptic plasticity underlying learning, memory, and neuropsychiatric disorders. However, whether Cdk5 participates in the development of depressive diseases has not been examined. Using the chronic mild stress (CMS) procedure, we examined the effects of Cdk5/p35 activity in the hippocampus on depressive-like behaviour in rats. We found that CMS increased Cdk5 activity in the hippocampus, accompanied by translocation of neuronal-specific activator p35 from the cytosol to the membrane in the dentate gyrus (DG) subregion. Inhibition of Cdk5 in DG but not in the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) or CA3 hippocampal subregions inhibited the development of depressive-like symptoms. Overexpression of p35 in DG blocked the antidepressant-like effect of venlafaxine in the CMS model. Moreover, the antidepressants venlafaxine and mirtazapine, but not the antipsychotic aripiprazole, reduced Cdk5 activity through the redistribution of p35 from the membrane to the cytosol in DG. Our results showed that the development of depressive-like behaviour is associated with increased Cdk5 activity in the hippocampus and that the Cdk5/p35 complex plays a key role in the regulation of depressive-like behaviour and antidepressant actions.",

        "abstract": "China has experienced an epidemic of amphetamine-type stimulant (ATS) use in recent years. The present study explored the status and correlates of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among ATS users in China.A multicenter cross-sectional study of HIV and HCV status and associated behaviors among ATS users was conducted in 6 provinces from September 2009 to December 2010. Socioeconomic/behavioral risk factors were measured. Blood samples were collected to test for HIV and HCV antibodies.Of the 1327 ATS users, the prevalence of HIV and exposure to HCV were 4.5% and 43.5%, respectively, with large geographic variations (0%-20.3% and 8.6%-67.1%, respectively). HIV infection was independently associated with living in Yunnan province [adjusted odds ratio = 15.8; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0 to 125.1), polydrug use (adjusted odds ratio = 2.6; 95% CI: 1.3 to 5.4), increased frequency of sexual behavior (adjusted odds ratio = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.1 to 4.1), history of sex with sexually transmitted infection-positive persons (adjusted odds ratio = 11.4; 95% CI: 1.3 to 98.9), and HCV infection (adjusted odds ratio = 2.8; 95% CI: 1.2 to 6.7). HCV was associated with study site, marital status, unemployment (adjusted odds ratio = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.3 to 2.4), a longer duration of ATS use, and history of injection use of ATS (adjusted odds ratio = 13.3; 95% CI: 1.5 to 116.1).The prevalence of HIV was high among ATS users in Yunnan province but quite rare elsewhere, and the prevalence of exposure to HCV was high in 6 provinces. Risk factors emphasize the need for new prevention strategies toward this population at risk in China.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that a higher consumption of green tea leads to a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms in elderly individuals. However, no studies have explored the antidepressant-like effect of green tea in preclinical models of depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the antidepressant-like effects and the possible mechanism of action of green tea in widely used mouse models of depression. Mice were orally administered green tea polyphenols (GTP; 5, 10 and 20mg/kg) for 7days and assessed in the forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) 60min after the last GTP administration. Serum corticosterone and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) levels were also determined immediately after the FST. Green tea polyphenols significantly reduced immobility in both the FST and TST but did not alter locomotor activity in the open field test, suggesting that GTP has antidepressant-like effects, and this action did not induce nonspecific motor changes in mice. Green tea polyphenols also reduced serum corticosterone and ACTH levels in mice exposed to the FST. The present study demonstrated that GTP exerts antidepressant-like effects in a mouse behavioral models of depression, and the mechanism may involve inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.",

        "abstract": "Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a neuropeptide and its receptor is extensively expressed throughout the brain. MCH has been suggested to regulate the rewarding and reinforcing effects of psychostimulants by potentiating the dopaminergic system within the midbrain. Moreover, MCH and its receptor can regulate ERK activity. The present study investigated the role of MCH in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in rats behaviourally sensitized to methamphetamine (Meth). We found that the development of Meth-induced locomotor sensitization was attenuated by MCH infused into the NAc shell but not core. Moreover, the elevation of ERK phosphorylation in the NAc shell induced by Meth was inhibited by locally infused MCH. Infusion of the MCH receptor 1 (MCHR1) antagonist SNAP 94847 into the NAc shell but not core augmented the initiation of locomotor sensitization and amplitude of elevated phosphorylated ERK levels induced by Meth. The expression of Meth-induced locomotor sensitization and ERK alterations after 1 wk withdrawal were not affected by either MCH or SNAP 94847 infused into the NAc shell or core. These results indicate that MCH in the NAc shell plays a critical role in the development but not expression of Meth-induced locomotor sensitization in rats, which might be mediated by the ERK signalling pathway. Our study suggests that MCH might be a potential target for the treatment of Meth addiction.",

        "abstract": "Relapse to drug seeking was studied using a rodent model of reinstatement induced by exposure to drug-related cues. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates cell growth and survival by controlling translation in response to nutrients and growth factors, has been demonstrated to be involved in neuronal adaptations that underlie drug addiction and learning and memory. We investigated the potential role of the mTOR signaling pathway in relapse to cocaine seeking by using the cue-induced reinstatement model in self-administering rats. We found that exposure to a cocaine-related cue induced reinstatement to cocaine seeking and increased phosphorylation of p70s6 kinase (p70s6k) and ribosomal protein s6 (rps6), measures of mTOR activity, in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core but not shell. Furthermore, inhibition of NAc core but not shell p70s6k and rps6 phosphorylation by rapamycin decreased cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Finally, stimulation of NAc core p70s6k and rps6 phosphorylation by NMDA enhanced cue-induced reinstatement, an effect reversed by rapamycin pretreatment. Additionally, rapamycin infusion into the NAc core or shell did not alter ongoing cocaine self-administration or cue-induced reinstatement of sucrose seeking. These findings indicate that cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking is mediated by activation of the mTOR signaling pathway in the NAc core.",

        "abstract": "Circadian disturbances are strongly linked with major depression. The circadian proteins CLOCK and BMAL1 are abundantly expressed but function differently in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and hippocampus. However, their roles in depressive-like behavior are still poorly understood.To investigate the alterations of CLOCK and BMAL1 in the SCN and hippocampus in rats subjected to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) and to explore the relationship of circadian protein and the depressive-like behavior.Together with depressive-like behavior induced by CUS, CLOCK and BMAL1 in the SC were inhibited during the light period, and the peak expression of CLOCK in the hippocampus was shifted from the dark to light period. BMAL1 expression in the hippocampus was not significantly changed. Two weeks after the termination of CUS, abnormalities of CLOCK in the CA1 and CA3 endured, with unchanged depressive-like behavior, but the expression of CLOCK and BMAL1 in the SCN recovered to control levels. Knockdown of the Clock gene in CA1 induced depressive-like behavior in normal rats. CLOCK in the SCN and hippocampus may participate in the development of depressive-like behavior. However, CLOCK in the hippocampus but not SCN was involved in the long-lasting effects of CUS on depressive-like behavior. BMAL1 in the hippocampus appeared to be unrelated to the effects of CUS on depressive-like behavior.CLOCK protein in the hippocampus but not SCN play an important role in the long-lasting depressive-like behavior induced by CUS. These findings suggest a novel therapeutic target in the development of new antidepressants focusing on the regulation of circadian rhythm.",

        "abstract": "Objective:Cigarette smoking rates are 3-4 times higher among American and European schizophrenics than community controls,and are associated with reduced negative and extrapyramidal symptoms and improved cognitive functioning. The aims of the present study were to examine these clinical associations in Chinese schizophrenics. Methods:We compared 776 male schizophrenics to 560 male community controls on the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) and on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Patients also were administered the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS),the Simpson and Angus Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (SAES),and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). Results:Lifetime smoking was higher for the schizophrenics than community controls(79% vs 63%),and heavy smoking showed a greater difference from controls (61% vs 31%). The PANSS negative symptom and SAES Parkinsonism scores were lower in current smokers than non-smokers. Cognitive functioning on the RBANS was worst for smoking schizophrenics,then better for non-smoking schizophrenics,then smoking controls,and then non-smoking controls who scored best. Conclusion:Smoking rates in China are modestly higher among schizophrenics than community controls,but nicotine dependence rates show large differences between schizophrenics and controls that are found in America. Smoking is associated with lower negative symptoms and less Parkinsonism,suggesting self-medication. However,smoking in both schizophrenics and controls is associated with significant cognitive impairments.",

Accumulating evidence has linked intense and involuntary craving, Impulsive decision-making and mood disturbances to risk for relapse.

Depression, anxiety, and impulsivity were also examined. One hundred thirty-nine METH abusers who were abstinent for the aforementioned times then underwent a cue session, and subjective and physiological measures were assessed.METH dependent individuals who were abstinent for longer periods of time exhibited better decision-making than those who were abstinent for shorter periods of time. And self-reported emotional symptoms improved with abstinence. METH abusers' ratings of craving decreased with the duration of abstinence, while cue-induced craving increased until 3 months of abstinence and decreased at 6 months and 1 year of abstinence.We present time-dependent alterations in decision-making, emotional state, and the incubation of cue-induced craving in METH-dependent individuals, which might have significant clinical implications for the prevention of relapse.",

        "abstract": "Conditioned fear memories can be updated by extinction during reconsolidation, and this effect is specific to the reactivated conditioned stimulus (CS). However, a traumatic event can be associated with several cues, and each cue can potentially trigger recollection of the event. We introduced a technique to target all diverse cues associated with an aversive event that causes fear.In human experiments, 161 subjects underwent modified fear conditioning, in which they were exposed to an unconditioned stimulus (US) or unreinforced CS to reactivate the memory and then underwent extinction, spontaneous recovery, and reinstatement. In animal experiments, 343 rats underwent contextual fear conditioning under a similar protocol as that used in the human experiments. We also explored the molecular alterations after US reactivation in rats.Presentation of a lower intensity US before extinction disrupted the associations between the different CS and reactivated US in both humans and rats. This effect persisted for at least 6 months in humans and was selective to the reactivated US. This procedure was also effective for remote memories in both humans and rats. Compared with the CS, the US induced stronger endocytosis of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid glutamate receptors 1 and 2 and stronger activation of protein kinase A, p70S6 kinase, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein in the dorsal hippocampus in rats.These findings demonstrate that a modified US retrieval extinction strategy may have a potential impact on therapeutic approaches to prevent the return of fear.",

A total of 12 SNPs (rs736707, rs362691, rs607755, rs2229864, rs7341475, rs262355, rs362719, rs11496125, g.-888G \u00a0 > \u00a0 C, rs2299356, rs528528, and rs4298437) in RELN gene were included into meta-analyses. Subgroup analyses based on ethnicity were performed. We found that RELN rs736707 was significantly related with psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) in Asian group (C vs T, OR \u00a0 = \u00a0 1.26, 95% CI \u00a0 = \u00a0 1.13\u20131.41, P \u00a0 < \u00a0 0.01, FDR \u00a0 < \u00a0 0.01), and rs7341475 was only significantly associated with reduced risk of schizophrenia in Caucasian (A vs G, OR \u00a0 = \u00a0 0.88, 95% CI \u00a0 = \u00a0 0.82\u20130.95, P \u00a0 < \u00a0 0.01, FDR \u00a0 < \u00a0 0.01). No association of other SNPs and psychiatric disorders is found. These findings suggest a role of RELN SNPs in psychiatric diseases, and indicate that further researches in populations with different genetic background and studies with larger sample size are of great value.",

        "abstract": "The physiological and psychological responses to drug cue exposure have been assessed in substance abusers. However, there is no study to demonstrate whether the responses to drug cue exposure are diurnal dependence. The present study was to examine whether there was a variation in drug-related cue reactivity across the diurnal cycle among recently abstinent opiate addicts.Four groups of 20 abstinent heroin dependent patients (n=80) were exposed to both neutral and drug-related videos at four separate times during the day: 8:00, 12:00, 16:00, and 20:00 h. Physiological and psychological responses, including heart rate, blood pressure, heroin craving, and subjective anxiety were assessed before and after each cue exposure.Drug cue significantly increased craving ratings compared to neutral cues across all the four separate times of day. Drug cue-induced craving was greater in the morning (8:00 am) than noon (12:00 pm), but was similar to evening assessments (8 pm). Drug cues also significantly increased anxiety, which positively correlated with cue-induced craving. Drug cues increased heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, which were not correlated with cue-induced craving or anxiety. However, no time effects were found on the three physiological measures.Cue-induced craving could be profoundly affected by the time points of cue exposure, using cue-reactivity paradigm. The relative sensitivity of morning and evening assessments of drug craving suggests a need for replication and further research on mechanisms contributing to these diurnal variations.",

        "abstract": "Currently approved medications for opioid addiction have shown clinical efficacy, but undesired side effects, dependence induced by the medications themselves, and low treatment compliance necessitate the need for novel therapies.A novel morphine-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate vaccine was synthesized with 6-glutarylmorphine as the hapten and a lengthened linker of 6 carbon atoms. The titer and specificity of the triggered antibody were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effects of the vaccine on the morphine-induced elevation of dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The effects of the vaccine on morphine-induced locomotor sensitization and heroin-primed reinstatement of heroin self-administration were also assessed.After subcutaneous administration in rats, the vaccine triggered a high antibody titer, with comparable specificity for morphine, 6-acetylmorphine, and heroin, but no interaction with dissimilar therapeutic opioid compounds, including buprenorphine, naloxone, and nalorphine, was observed. The vaccine significantly prevented the elevation of dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens induced by a single morphine challenge. Moreover, the vaccine prevented the expression of morphine-induced locomotor sensitization and heroin-primed reinstatement of heroin seeking, suggesting its potential for preventing relapse.These results demonstrate that active immunization with the present vaccine induces a robust morphine/heroin-specific antibody response in rats and attenuates the behavioral effects of morphine and heroin.",

        "abstract": "Extinction therapy has been suggested to suppress the conditioned motivational effect of drug cues to prevent relapse. However, extinction forms a new inhibiting memory rather than erasing the original memory trace and drug memories invariably return. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are a specialized extracellular matrix around interneurons in the brain that have been suggested to be a permissive factor that allows synaptic plasticity in the adolescent brain. The degradation of PNNs caused by chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) may generate induced juvenile-like plasticity (iPlasticity) and promote experience-dependent plasticity in the adult brain. In the present study, we investigated the effect of removing PNNs in the amygdala of rat on the extinction of drug memories. We found that extinction combined with intra-amygdala injections of ChABC (0.01 U/side) prevented the subsequent priming-induced reinstatement of morphine-induced and cocaine-induced, but not food -induced, conditioned place preference (CPP). Intra-amygdala injections of ChABC alone had no effect on the retention, retrieval, or relearning of morphine-induced CPP and storage of acquired food-induced CPP. Moreover, we found that the procedure facilitated the extinction of heroin- and cocaine-seeking behavior and prevented the spontaneous recovery and drug-induced reinstatement of heroin- and cocaine-seeking behavior. We also found that the effect of PNNs degradation combined with extinction may be mediated by the potentiation of several plasticity-related proteins in the amygdala. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that a combination of extinction training with PNNs degradation in the amygdala erases drug memories and suggest that ChABC may be an attractive candidate for the prevention of relapse.",

We used search terms of treatment and neurobiology of herbal medicines, and acupuncture for drug abuse and dependence.Acupuncture showed evidence for clinical efficacy and relevant neurobiological mechanisms in opiate withdrawal, but it showed poor efficacy for alcohol and nicotine withdrawal or relapse prevention, and no large studies supported its efficacy for cocaine in well-designed clinical trials. Clinical trials were rare for herbal remedies. Radix Puerariae showed the most promising efficacy for alcoholism by acting through daidzin, which inhibits mitocochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 and leads to disulfiram-like alcohol reactions. Peyote also has some evidence for alcoholism treatment among Native Americans. Ginseng and Kava lack efficacy data in addictions, and Kava can be hepatotoxic. Thunbergia laurifolia can protect against alcoholic liver toxicity. Withania somnifera and Salvia miltiorrhiza have no efficacy data, but can reduce morphine tolerance and alcohol intake, respectively, in animal models.Traditional herbal treatments can compliment pharmacotherapies for drug withdrawal and possibly relapse prevention with less expense and perhaps fewer side effects with notable exceptions. Both acupuncture and herbal treatments need testing as adjuncts to reduce doses and durations of standard pharmacotherapies.",

        "abstract": "The effects of stress on emotional memory are distinct and depend on the stages of memory. Memory undergoes consolidation and reconsolidation after acquisition and retrieval, respectively. Stress facilitates the consolidation but disrupts the reconsolidation of emotional memory. Previous research on the effects of stress on memory have focused on long-term memory (LTM) formation (tested 24 h later), but the effects of stress on the persistence of LTM (tested at least 1 week later) are unclear. Recent findings indicated that the persistence of LTM requires late-phase protein synthesis in the dorsal hippocampus. The present study investigated the effect of stress (i.e., cold water stress) during the late phase after the acquisition and retrieval of contextual fear memory in rats. We found that stress and corticosterone administration during the late phase (12 h) after acquisition, referred to as late consolidation, selectively enhanced the persistence of LTM, whereas stress during the late phase (12 h) after retrieval, referred to as late reconsolidation, selectively disrupted the restabilized persistence of LTM. Moreover, the effects of stress on the persistence of LTM were blocked by the corticosterone synthesis inhibitor metyrapone, which was administered before stress, suggesting that the glucocorticoid system is involved in the effects of stress on the persistence of LTM. We conclude that stress within a restricted time window after acquisition or retrieval selectively affects the persistence of LTM and depends on the glucocorticoid system.",

ZNF804A has been identified as one of the most compelling risk genes associated with broad phenotypes related to psychosis. We conducted a systematic meta-analysis and reviewed ZNF804A variants in psychosis-related disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. We also summarized the association between other zinc finger protein genes (ZNFs) and psychiatric diseases. The meta-analysis included a total of six variants of ZNF804A and three variants of other ZNFs (ZDHHC8 and ZKSCAN4), and the effects of ZNF variants on neurocognition and neuroimaging phenotypes were reviewed. The biological functions of these variants are also presented. We verified that ZNF804A was significantly related to psychiatric diseases, and the association between ZNF804A rs1344706 and psychosis (schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) did not vary with disease or ethnicity. The main brain area regulated by ZNF804A rs1344706 was the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The effect of ZNF804A variants on cognition did not display consistency with different diseases or methodologies. These findings suggest that ZNF804A might play an important role in common pathogenesis of psychiatric diseases, and its variants are likely involved in regulating the expression of psychosis-related genes, especially the dopamine pathway genes. Further research should focus on the molecular mechanisms by which ZNF804A variants act in psychiatric diseases and related phenotypes.",

        "abstract": "Propofol is a widely used intravenous anesthetic for the fast induction of anesthesia and rapid recovery from general surgery. However, propofol also has potential for dependence and abuse particularly for recreational purpose. In this review, we first summarized the pharmacokinetics and pharmacological properties of propofol and the potential for its tolerance, psychological dependence in sensitive individuals. Subsequently, we analysed the link between the cognitive impairment and abuse of propofol. Finally, we reviewed the neurobiological changes induced by exposure to anesthetic propofol. The rewarding effect of propofol has been shown in both rodents and humans at subanaesthetic doses, suggesting the risk of its abuse in the general population. Cognitive function is impaired in vulnerable individuals after treatment with propofol via alterations of dopamine receptors, NMDA/GABA receptors, BDNF-TrkB-CREB pathway, as well as neuronal autophagy, and this impairment might be associated with the increased risk for propofol abuse. Further investigation focused on the ability of propofol to regulate neural circuitry in reward and memory will help inform clinical researchers aimed at using cognitive enhancers as treatments for propofol abuse and anesthesia-induced cognitive decline.",

Lower functional connectivity in dorsal DMN was related to impairments of basic cognitive function.

        "abstract": "Individual differences in regulation of fear and extinction memory play significant roles in the aetiology development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Previous animal based studies showed that the activity of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2-ARs) are involved in memory modulation. However in humans it is not clear that whether genetic variability in \u03b2-ARs contributes to individual differences of fear and extinction memory. In the current study, we investigated the role of a common single-nucleotide polymorphism of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) gene in fear memory acquisition, fear memory extinction, extinction recall and fear generalization in human participants. Ninety-one male participants were exposed to a Pavlovian fear conditioning and their fear responses were assessed by the skin conductance response. Participants were genotyped for a polymorphism (rs2400207) located within the promoter region of the human ADRB2. Differences between genotypes were observed in the extinction memory recall test but not in fear acquisition, extinction learning and fear generalization. Particularly, A-allele carriers of rs2400707 displayed successful retention of extinction memory and prevented the return of fear during recall test. The results revealed the involvement of human noradrenergic system in the retention of extinction memory and genetic variability in this system may underlie individual differences in PTSD. Furthermore, rs2400207 polymorphism of ADRB2 gene may play a key role in the treatment efficacy of PTSD and can be a basis for future studies investigating a personalized medicine for fear memory related disorders.",

        "abstract": "Schizophrenia (SCZ) patients and their unaffected first-degree relatives (FDRs) share similar functional neuroanatomy. However, it remains largely unknown to what extent unaffected FDRs with functional neuroanatomy patterns similar to patients can be identified at an individual level. In this study, we used a multivariate pattern classification method to learn informative large-scale functional networks (FNs) and build classifiers to distinguish 32 patients from 30 healthy controls and to classify 34 FDRs as with or without FNs similar to patients. Four informative FNs-the cerebellum, default mode network (DMN), ventral frontotemporal network, and posterior DMN with parahippocampal gyrus-were identified based on a training cohort and pattern classifiers built upon these FNs achieved a correct classification rate of 83.9% (sensitivity 87.5%, specificity 80.0%, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.914) estimated based on leave-one-out cross-validation for the training cohort and a correct classification rate of 77.5% (sensitivity 72.5%, specificity 82.5%, and AUC 0.811) for an independent validation cohort. The classification scores of the FDRs and patients were negatively correlated with their measures of cognitive function. FDRs identified by the classifiers as having SCZ patterns were similar to the patients, but significantly different from the controls and FDRs with normal patterns in terms of their cognitive measures. These results demonstrate that the pattern classifiers built upon the informative FNs can serve as biomarkers for quantifying brain alterations in SCZ and help to identify FDRs with FN patterns and cognitive impairment similar to those of SCZ patients.",

        "abstract": "Methamphetamine abuse has become a serious public health problem. However, effective treatment for methamphetamine addiction remains elusive, especially considering its high rate of relapse after treatment. A conditioned stimulus (CS) memory retrieval-extinction procedure has been demonstrated to decrease reinstatement of cocaine, heroin, and alcohol seeking in rats, and to reduce cue-induced cravings in heroin and nicotine addicts. The goal of the present study is to explore the effect of the CS memory retrieval-extinction procedure on methamphetamine seeking in rats and the underlying mechanisms. We found that daily retrieval of methamphetamine-associated memories 1 h before extinction sessions decreased subsequent drug priming-induced reinstatement, spontaneous recovery, and renewal of methamphetamine seeking. We also found that retrieval of methamphetamine-associated memories induced neuronal activation in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), while presenting extinction within the time window of reconsolidation abolished the neuronal activation in BLA. These results indicate that the CS memory retrieval-extinction procedure could prevent reconsolidation of methamphetamine memory traces in BLA and subsequent methamphetamine craving and relapse.",

However, the alterations in structural brain connections that may underlie these functional and neurocognitive impairments remain largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated topological organization alterations in the structural network of white matter in heroin abusers and examined the relationships between the network changes and clinical measures. We acquired diffusion tensor imaging datasets from 76 heroin abusers and 78 healthy controls. Network-based statistic was applied to identify alterations in interregional white matter connectivity, and graph theory methods were used to analyze the properties of global networks. The participants also completed a battery of neurocognitive measures. One increased subnetwork characterizing widespread abnormalities in structural connectivity was present in heroin users, which mainly composed of default-mode, attentional and visual systems. The connection strength was positively correlated with increases in fractional anisotropy in heroin abusers. Intriguingly, the changes in within-frontal and within-temporal connections in heroin abusers were significantly correlated with daily heroin dosage and impulsivity scores, respectively. These findings suggest that heroin abusers have extensive abnormal white matter connectivity, which may mediate the relationship between heroin dependence and clinical measures. The increase in white matter connectivity may be attributable to the inefficient microstructure integrity of white matter. The present findings extend our understanding of cerebral structural disruptions that underlie neurocognitive and functional deficits in heroin addiction and provide circuit-level markers for this chronic disorder.",

Human and animal studies have shown that the change of amygdala activity after traumatic stress may contribute to occurrences of some symptoms or behaviors of the patients or animals with PTSD. However, it is still unknown how the neuronal activation of different sub-regions in amygdala changes during the development of PTSD. In the present study, we used single prolonged stress (SPS) procedure to obtain the animal model of PTSD, and found that 1 day after SPS, there were normal anxiety behavior and extinction of fear memory in rats which were accompanied by a reduced proportion of activated glutamatergic neurons and increased proportion of activated GABAergic neurons in basolateral amygdala (BLA). About 10 days after SPS, we observed enhanced anxiety and impaired extinction of fear memory with increased activated both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in BLA and increased activated GABAergic neurons in central amygdala (CeA). These results indicate that during early and late phase after traumatic stress, distinct patterns of activation of glutamatergic neurons and GABAergic neurons are displayed in amygdala, which may be implicated in the development of PTSD.",

        "abstract": "Background: Common molecular and cellular foundations underlie different types of substance dependence (SD). However direct evidence for common genetic factors of SD is lacking. Here we aimed to identify specific genetic variants that are shared between alcoholism, heroin and methamphetamine dependence. Methods: We first conducted a combined case-control genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) of 521 alcoholic, 1,026 heroin and 1,749 methamphetamine patients and 2,859 healthy controls. We then replicated the significant loci using an independent cohort (146 alcoholic, 1,045 heroin, 763 methamphetamine and 1,904 controls). Second, we examined the genetic effects of these identified SNPs on gene expression, addiction characteristics and brain images (gray and white matter). Furthermore, we investigated the effects of these genetic variants on addiction behaviors using self-administration rat models. Results: We identified and validated four genome-wide significant loci in the combined cohorts in the discovery stage: ADH1B rs1229984, ANKS1B rs2133896, AGBL4 rs147247472 and CTNNA2 rs10196867. Association results for each dependence group showed that ADH1B rs1229984 was only associated with alcoholism, while the other three loci were associated with heroin, methamphetamine addiction and alcoholism respectively. Variants that were strongly linked to rs2133896 affected ANKS1B gene expression, heroin use frequency and interacted with heroin dependence to affect gray matter of the left calcarine and white matter of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus. In addition, the reduced anks1b expression in the ventral tegmental area increased addiction vulnerability for heroin and methamphetamine in self-administration rat models. Conclusion: Our findings revealed several novel genome-wide significant SNPs and genes that synchronously affected the vulnerability and phenotypes for alcoholism, heroin and MA dependence. These findings could shed light on the root cause and the generalized vulnerability for SD.",

        "abstract": "Fear is prone to return following extinction that is the basis of exposure therapy for fear-related disorders. Manipulations that enhance the extinction process can be beneficial for treatment. Animal studies have shown that fasting or caloric restriction can enhance extinction and inhibit the return of fear. The present study examined the effects of fasting on fear acquisition, extinction, and the return of fear in humans. One hundred and twenty-five male participants were randomized into a fasting group and food group and exposed to a Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm. Changes in plasma cortisol and ghrelin levels were examined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. One-night fasting had no effect on fear acquisition but enhanced fear extinction retention and prevented the return of fear, and this effect persisted for at least 6 months. This procedure was also effective for remote fear memory. Plasma ghrelin levels were elevated after fasting and had a negative relationship with the fear response in spontaneous recovery test. However, overnight fasting did not affect cortisol levels. These findings indicate that fasting enhances extinction retention and prevents the return of fear, without influencing fear memory formation. We propose that this novel procedure may open new avenues for promoting extinction-based therapies for fear-related disorders.",

        "abstract": "Propofol is a widely used intravenous anesthetic for the fast induction of anesthesia and rapid recovery from general surgery. However, propofol also has potential for dependence and abuse particularly for recreational purpose. In this review, we first summarized the pharmacokinetics and pharmacological properties of propofol and the potential for its tolerance, psychological dependence in sensitive individuals. Subsequently, we analysed the link between the cognitive impairment and abuse of propofol. Finally, we reviewed the neurobiological changes induced by exposure to anesthetic propofol. The rewarding effect of propofol has been shown in both rodents and humans at subanaesthetic doses, suggesting the risk of its abuse in the general population. Cognitive function is impaired in vulnerable individuals after treatment with propofol via alterations of dopamine receptors, NMDA/GABA receptors, BDNF-TrkB-CREB pathway, as well as neuronal autophagy, and this impairment might be associated with the increased risk for propofol abuse. Further investigation focused on the ability of propofol to regulate neural circuitry in reward and memory will help inform clinical researchers aimed at using cognitive enhancers as treatments for propofol abuse and anesthesia-induced cognitive decline.",

        "abstract": "Fear memory underlies anxiety-related disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a fear-based disorder, characterized by difficulties in extinguishing the learned fear response and maintaining extinction. Currently, the first-line treatment for PTSD is exposure therapy, which forms an extinction memory to compete with the original fear memory. However, the extinguished fear often returns under numerous circumstances, suggesting that novel methods are needed to eliminate fear memory or facilitate extinction memory. This review discusses research that targeted extinction and reconsolidation to manipulate fear memory. Recent studies indicate that sleep is an active state that can regulate memory processes. We also discuss the influence of sleep on fear memory. For each manipulation, we briefly summarize the neural mechanisms that have been identified in human studies. Finally, we highlight potential limitations and future directions in the field to better translate existing interventions to clinical settings.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The illegal use of methamphetamine (MA) is a growing public health concern globally, causing a series of adverse reactions. The prominent negative effect of MA use is MA-related psychiatric symptoms (MAP) which is much higher than the general population. MAP often includes multiple dimensions of cognitive impairment and induces adverse consequences such as violence and suicide. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the factors that affect the development of psychosis in those who use MA. Besides, the evaluate assessment methods of MAP are generally disunity. Therefore, here we compare the different features of MAP and various kinds of the assessment instruments, and summarized the risk factors of MAP from MA use-related factors, sociodemographic variables and life events and genetic factors. We found that the association between MA-related risk factors and MAP were greatly consistent. The likelihood of experiencing MAP was significantly associated with a larger or higher frequency of MA dose and other MA-related factors among MA users. However, the reports about other MAP\u2013related risk factors (e.g, life events and genetics) were relatively inconsistent. The causal and longitudinal studies which focus on multilateral comparison would be desired in the future. This review would provide high quality evidence on risk factors of MAP, which would be helpful for developing early prevention and treatment method of MAP.

        "abstract": "Hiking is a form of green tourism which deserves promotion and popularization, especially in present day China. However, the risks inherent in hiking could have a negative impact on the development of hiking tourism. It is important to better understand how people perceive the risks of hiking and what type of experience attributes they prefer. However, no studies have investigated the nature of risk perception from the perspective of hikers. This study explores the dimensions of the perceived risk of hiking and investigates the associated factors of hiking risk perception as well as hiking preference. A questionnaire with 18 items was used to capture people's perception of hiking risks, and two groups of samples were surveyed. Generally, this study identified two dimensions of perceived risk towards hiking based on a sample of hikers, i.e., physical risk and psychological risk. Demographic variables such as gender, upbringing background, and hiking frequency were shown to predict hiking risk perception while gender and hiking frequency predicted route preference. The personality trait of sensation seeking appeared to be a significant predictor of hiking preference. These findings lend themselves to market segmentation and marketing strategies on hiking tourism.",

        "abstract": "Recently the role of the orexin system in the learning and memory, especially orexin A, which could enhance fear memory through regulating the activity of amygdala, has drawn considerable attention. However, the relationship between orexin A and extinction memory remains unclear. To investigate the effect of orexin A on extinction memory in humans, we recruited 43 male subjects and divided them into a recent group and remote group. After acquiring Pavlovian fear conditioning, individuals in recent group experienced fear extinction 24 h after acquisition, and remote group underwent extinction 2 weeks later. Meanwhile, plasma orexin A levels before extinction were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Both groups received memory test 24 h after fear extinction. The results showed that both recent and remote groups successfully acquired fear conditioning and had spontaneous recovery at test. In particular, the correlational analysis indicated that orexin A levels before extinction were negatively associated with fear responses during test only in recent group, but not in remote group. Moreover, individuals with high orexin A levels still kept low fear responses after extinction in recent group by subgroup analyses. The results suggest that orexin A could influence the retention of recent fear memory extinction, without affecting remote fear extinction. These findings remind us the orexin system can be a potential treatment target for fear-related disorders, and the mechanisms of recent and remote fear extinction may be different.",

Identifying candidate endophenotypes may serve as a tool for elucidating its biological and neural mechanisms. The present study investigated the similarities and differences of features of brain network connectivity between patients and their first-degree relatives. Independent component analysis was conducted on imaging data collected from 34 healthy controls, 33 schizophrenia patients, and 30 unaffected first-degree relatives. The correlation between functional connectivity with neurocognitive performance and clinical symptoms were calculated. Abnormalities of between-network connectivity largely overlapped in patients and first-degree relatives, but the extent of such abnormalities was relatively minor in relatives. Negative connectivity between language networks and executive control networks was impaired in schizophrenia patients and their first-degree relatives, and this decreased connectivity was correlated with performance in language processing. Similar impairments were found in high-visual network and executive network coupling, and this decreased connection was correlated with the severity of positive symptoms in patients. The results indicated that abnormal functional connectivity within and between perceptual systems (i.e., high-visual and language) and executive control networks was related to the generic risk of schizophrenia, which makes it a potential endophenotype for schizophrenia.",

We examined the effects of a short photoperiod condition on the susceptibility to subchronic unpredictable mild stress (SCUS) and rhythmic alterations of plasma corticosterone (CORT), melatonin, and neuropeptide Y (NPY) in adolescent male rats. Compared with the 12 \u00a0 h/12 \u00a0 h light/dark photoperiod control (CON) rats, the 8 \u00a0 h/16 \u00a0 h photoperiod SCUS rats exhibited significant anhedonia, a core symptom of human depression, together with a blunted diurnal rhythm and elevation of 24 \u00a0 h CORT, melatonin, and NPY levels. The 8 \u00a0 h/16 \u00a0 h photoperiod condition also blunted the rhythmicity of CORT, caused a phase inversion of melatonin, and caused a phase delay of NPY compared with 12 \u00a0 h/12 \u00a0 h CON rats. Such abnormalities of plasma CORT, NPY, and melatonin might cause adolescent individuals to present higher stress reactivity and greater vulnerability to stress over their lifetimes. The present study provides evidence of the susceptibility to the seasonality of stress-related disorders in adolescence.",

A 40-bp variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of the DAT has been reported to be associated with various phenotypes that are involved in the aberrant regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission. In the present study, we found that miR-137 and miR-491 caused a marked reduction of DAT expression, thereby influencing neuronal dopamine transport. Moreover, the regulation of miR-137 and miR-491 on this transport disappeared after the DAT was silenced. The miR-491 seed region that is located on the VNTR sequence in the 3'UTR of the DAT and the regulatory effect of miR-491 on the DAT depended on the VNTR copy-number. These data indicate that miR-137 and miR-491 regulate DAT expression and dopamine transport at the post-transcriptional level, suggesting that microRNA may be targeted for the treatment of diseases associated with DAT dysfunction.",

        "abstract": "The reward system plays a vital role in drug addiction. The purpose of this study is to investigate the structural connectivity characteristics and driving-control subnetwork patterns of reward circuits in heroin abusers and assess the genetic modulation on the reward network. We first defined the reward network based on systematic literature review, and built the reward network based on diffusion tensor imaging data of 78 heroin abusers (HAs) and 79 healthy controls (HCs) using structural connectomics. Then we assessed genetic factors that might modulate changes in the reward network by performing imaging-genetic screening for 22 addiction-related polymorphisms. The genetic association was validated by performing genetic associations (1032 HAs and 2863 HCs) and expanded-variant analysis. Finally, we estimated the association between these genetic variations, reward network, and clinical performance. We found that HAs had widespread deficiencies in the structural connectivity of the reward circuit (center in VTA-linked connections), which correlated with cognition deficiency. The disruptions synchronously were shown on the reward driving system and reward control system. GABRA2 rs279858-linked variants might be a key genetic modulator for heroin vulnerability by affecting the connections of reward network and cognition. The role of the reward network connections that mediates the effects of rs279858 on cognition would be disrupted by heroin addiction. These findings provide new insights into the neurocircuitry and genetic mechanisms of addiction.",

Yet it remains largely unknown the extent to which sleep influences reward-associated behavior, in particular, whether and how sleep modulates reward evaluation that critically underlies value-based decisions. Here, we show that neural processing during sleep can selectively bias preferences in simple economic choices when the sleeper is stimulated by covert, reward-associated cues. Specifically, presenting the spoken name of a familiar, valued snack item during midday nap significantly improves the preference for that item relative to items not externally cued. The cueing-specific preference enhancement is sleep-dependent and can be predicted by cue-induced neurophysiological signals at the subject and item level. Computational modeling further suggests that sleep cueing accelerates evidence accumulation for cued options during the post-sleep choice process in a manner consistent with the preference shift. These findings suggest that neurocognitive processing during sleep contributes to the fine-tuning of subjective preferences in a flexible, selective manner.",

        "abstract": "Methamphetamine (MA)-related psychiatric symptoms (MAP) are serious comorbidities of MA use and result in many social problems such as violence and suicide. We investigated the sociodemographic and genetic risk factors for persistent MAP of MA users (MUs) and constructed an early MAP prediction model. Derivation and replication samples had 1734 and 905 MUs, respectively. Symptom Checklist 90, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Rating Scale-IV, and Social Support Rating Scale were used to assess the past-year prevalence of general MAP and life events retrospectively. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) was used to analyze MAP-related genetic factors. The prediction model was constructed by integrating the risk life events and clinical and genetic features using logistic regression. Of the 2639 MUs, 1293 (48.83%) had past-year MAP. The severity of MA addiction (SMA), childhood trauma, childhood ADHD symptoms, and social support were reliable risk factors for persistent MAP. By integrating these risk factors and the polygenic risk score from GWAS from derivation samples, the area under the curve (AUC) of the predictive model for MAP was 0.754 (95% CI 0.717~0.771). The risk factors and prediction model were also verified in replication samples. In addition, SMA, ADHD, and social support were mediators for the effect of the risk genetic factor on persistent MAP. Our study identified several risk factors for persistent MAP and will be helpful for developing scalable tools for the prevention of persistent and general MAP.",

        "abstract": "Fear memory underlies anxiety-related disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a fear-based disorder, characterized by difficulties in extinguishing the learned fear response and maintaining extinction. Currently, the first-line treatment for PTSD is exposure therapy, which forms an extinction memory to compete with the original fear memory. However, the extinguished fear often returns under numerous circumstances, suggesting that novel methods are needed to eliminate fear memory or facilitate extinction memory. This review discusses research that targeted extinction and reconsolidation to manipulate fear memory. Recent studies indicate that sleep is an active state that can regulate memory processes. We also discuss the influence of sleep on fear memory. For each manipulation, we briefly summarize the neural mechanisms that have been identified in human studies. Finally, we highlight potential limitations and future directions in the field to better translate existing interventions to clinical settings.",

        "abstract": "Major depression is a serious psychiatric disorder and remains a leading cause of disability worldwide. Conventional antidepressants take at least several weeks to achieve a therapeutic response and this lag period has hindered their ability to attain beneficial effects in depressed individuals at high risk of suicide. The non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in both rodents and humans. The emergence of ketamine as a fast-acting antidepressant provides promising new insights into the development of a rapid treatment response in patients with clinical depression. However, its safety and toxicity remain a concern. In this review, we focus on the limitations of ketamine, including neurotoxicity, cognitive dysfunction, adverse events associated with mental status, psychotomimetic effects, cardiovascular events, and uropathic effects. Studies have shown that its safety and tolerability profiles are generally good at low doses and with short-term treatment in depressed patients. The adverse events associated with ketamine usually occur with very high doses that are administered for prolonged periods of time and can be relieved by cessation. The antidepressant actions of its two enantiomers, S-ketamine (esketamine) and R-ketamine, are also discussed. R-ketamine has greater antidepressant actions than S-ketamine, without ketamine-related side-effects. Future treatment strategies should consider using R-ketamine for the treatment of depressed patients to decrease the risk of adverse events associated with long-term ketamine use.",

        "abstract": "Chinese herbal medicine has shown promise for heroin detoxification. This review extends a prior meta-analysis of Chinese herbal medicine for heroin detoxification, with particular attention to the time course of symptoms. Both English and Chinese databases were searched for randomized trials comparing Chinese herbal medicine to either alpha2-adrenergic agonists or opioid agonists for heroin detoxification. The methodological quality of each study was assessed with Jadad's scale (1-2 = low; 3-5 = high). Meta-analysis was performed with fixed- or random-effect models in RevMan software; outcome measures assessed were withdrawal-symptoms score, anxiety, and adverse effects of treatment. Twenty-one studies (2,949 participants) were included. For withdrawal-symptoms score relieving during the 10-day observation, Chinese herbal medicine was superior to alpha2-adrenergic agonists in relieving opioid-withdrawal symptoms during 4-10 days (except D8) and no difference was found within the first 3 days. Compared with opioid agonists, Chinese herbal medicine was inferior during the first 3 days, but the difference became non-significant during days 4-9. Chinese herbal medicine has better effect on anxiety relieving at late stage of intervention than alpha2-adrenergic agonists, and no difference with opioid agonists. The incidence of some adverse effects (fatigue, dizziness) was significantly lower for Chinese herbal medicine than for alpha2-adrenergic agonists (sufficient data for comparison with opioid agonists were not available). Findings were robust to file-drawer effects. Our meta-analysis suggests that Chinese herbal medicine is an effective and safety treatment for heroin detoxification. And more work is needed to determine the specific effects of specific forms of Chinese herbal medicine.",

        "abstract": "Sleep is one of the most fundamental processes of life, playing an important role in the regulation of brain function. The long-term lack of sleep can cause memory impairments, declines in learning ability, and executive dysfunction. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of sleep deprivation on instrumental learning behavior, particularly goal-directed and habitual actions in humans, and investigated the underlying neural mechanisms. Healthy college students of either gender were enrolled and randomly divided into sleep deprivation group and sleep control group. fMRI data were collected. We found that one night of sleep deprivation led to greater responsiveness to stimuli that were associated with devalued outcomes in the slips-of-action test, indicating a deficit in the formation of goal-directed control and an overreliance on habits. Furthermore, sleep deprivation had no effect on the expression of acquired goal-directed action. The level of goal-directed action after sleep deprivation was positively correlated with baseline working memory capacity. The neuroimaging data indicated that goal-directed learning mainly recruited the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC), the activation of which was less pronounced during goal-directed learning after sleep deprivation. Activation of the vmPFC during goal-directed learning during training was positively correlated with the level of goal-directed action performance. The present study suggests that people rely predominantly on habits at the expense of goal-directed control after sleep deprivation, and this process involves the vmPFC. These results contribute to a better understanding of the effects of sleep loss on decision-making. Understanding the cognitive consequences of sleep deprivation has become extremely important over the past half century, given the continued decline in sleep duration in industrialized societies. Our results provide novel evidence that goal-directed action may be particularly vulnerable to sleep loss, and the brain mechanism underlying this effect was explored. Elucidation of the effects of sleep deprivation on decision-making will deepen our understanding of the function of sleep, emphasizing the role of sleep in cognitive impairments and mental health.",

        "abstract": "Opioid use disorder (OUD) is associated with a high risk of premature death. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is the primary treatment for opioid dependence. We comprehensively assessed the effects of different MAT-related characteristics on mortality among those with OUD by a systematic review and meta-analysis. The all-cause and overdose crude mortality rates (CMRs) and relative risks (RRs) by treatment status, different type, period, and dose of medication, and retention time were pooled using random effects, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression. Thirty cohort studies involving 370,611 participants (1,378,815 person-years) were eligible in the meta-analysis. From 21 studies, the pooled all-cause CMRs were 0.92 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0.79-1.04) while receiving MAT, 1.69 (1.47-1.91) after cessation, and 4.89 (3.54-6.23) for untreated period. Based on 16 studies, the pooled overdose CMRs were 0.24 (0.20-0.28) while receiving MAT, 0.68 (0.55-0.80) after cessation of MAT, and 2.43 (1.72-3.15) for untreated period. Compared with patients receiving MAT, untreated participants had higher risk of all-cause mortality (RR 2.56 [95% CI: 1.72-3.80]) and overdose mortality (8.10 [4.48-14.66]), and discharged participants had higher risk of all-cause death (2.33 [2.02-2.67]) and overdose death (3.09 [2.37-4.01]). The all-cause CMRs during and after opioid substitution treatment with methadone or buprenorphine were 0.93 (0.76-1.10) and 1.79 (1.47-2.10), and corresponding estimate for antagonist naltrexone treatment were 0.26 (0-0.59) and 1.97 (0-5.18), respectively. Retention in MAT of over 1-year was associated with a lower mortality rate than that with retention \u22641 year (1.62, 1.31-1.93 vs. 5.31, -0.09-10.71). Improved coverage and adherence to MAT and post-treatment follow-up are crucial to reduce the mortality. Long-acting naltrexone showed positive advantage on prevention of premature death among persons with OUD.",

        "abstract": "Stress is a major risk factor for psychiatric disorders, such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and schizophrenia. Early life stress, such as maternal separation, can have long-term effects on the development of the central nervous system and pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. In the present study, we found that maternal separation increased the susceptibility to stress in adolescent rats, increased the expression of Na/K/2Cl cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) on postnatal day 14, and increased the expression of K/2Cl cotransporter 2 (KCC2) and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid A (GABA) receptor subunits on postnatal day 40 in the hippocampus. NKCC1 inhibition by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drug bumetanide during the first two postnatal weeks rescued the depressive- and anxiety-like behavior that was induced by maternal separation and decreased the expression of NKCC1, KCC2 and GABA receptor \u03b11 and \u03b22,3 subunits in the hippocampus. Bumetanide treatment during early development did not adversely affect body weight or normal behaviors in naive rats, or affect serum osmolality in adult rats. These results suggest that bumetanide treatment during early development may prevent the maternal separation-induced susceptibility to stress and impairments in GABAergic transmission in the hippocampus.",

        "title": "Effects of opiate substitution treatment on mortality for opioids users: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
        "abstract": "Abstract  Background  Opioid dependence is associated with high risk of premature death. Opiate-substitution treatment (OST) is the major treatment in community for opioid dependence worldwide. We aimed to estimate crude mortality rates (CMRs) and the effects of OST on mortality risk by meta-analysis.  Methods  We searched PubMed and Embase databases for articles that were published until Sept 30, 2016 with a combination of terms including opiate  treatment, substitution or maintenance,  or buprenorphine, mortality, and  or cohort studies. We restricted the search to articles written in English. We assessed the CMRs and relative risks (RR) for different OST status. We did subgroup analysis and meta-regression to determine the effect of treatment period, drug type, and drug dose on mortality.  Findings  29 longitudinal cohort studies involving 395\u2008055 participants (1\u2008611\u2008377\u00b78 person-years) were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. From 22 studies, the pooled all-cause CMRs of opioids users were 0\u00b790 per 100 person-years (95% CI 0\u00b777\u20131\u00b702) while receiving OST, 1\u00b763 (1\u00b741\u20131\u00b784) after cessation of OST, and 4\u00b791 (3\u00b752\u20136\u00b730) for an untreated period. On the basis of ten studies, the pooled overdose CMRs were 0\u00b718 (0\u00b716\u20130\u00b720) while receiving OST, 0\u00b776 (0\u00b752\u20131\u00b700) after cessation of OST, and 2\u00b702 (1\u00b730\u20132\u00b774) for an untreated period. Compared with patients receiving OST, untreated participants had higher risk of all-cause mortality (RR 2\u00b748; 95% CI 1\u00b773\u20133\u00b754) and overdose mortality (6\u00b760; 4\u00b773\u20139\u00b721), and participants discharged from OST had a higher risk for all-cause mortality (2\u00b727; 1\u00b799\u20132\u00b759) and a higher risk of fatal overdose (3\u00b776; 2\u00b724\u20136\u00b730). The risk of death was greatest in the first 2 weeks after discharge from OST (all-cause CMR 4\u00b771; 95% CI 1\u00b769\u20137\u00b773). We found evidence that buprenorphine was associated with a lower mortality risk than methadone after terminating OST (0\u00b781; 0\u00b770\u20130\u00b793). We found no difference of mortality risk to be associated with different types and dosages of  medication.  Interpretation  OST could decrease mortality risk in opioids users, especially death from drug overdose. The findings highlight the importance of OST in the prevention of premature death among opioids users. Prevention of discharge from OST and post-treatment follow-up should be encouraged to reduce mortality.

        "abstract": "Exposure to drug-paired cues causes drug memories to be in a destabilized state and interfering with memory reconsolidation can inhibit relapse. Calpain, a calcium-dependent neutral cysteine protease, is involved in synaptic plasticity and the formation of long-term fear memory. However, the role of calpain in the reconsolidation of drug reward memory is still unknown. In the present study, using a conditioned place preference (CPP) model, we found that exposure to drug-paired contextual stimuli induced the activation of calpain and decreased the expression of glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core, but not shell, of male rats. Infusions of calpain inhibitors in the NAc core immediately after retrieval disrupted the reconsolidation of cocaine/morphine cue memory and blocked retrieval-induced calpain activation and GRIP1 degradation. The suppressive effect of calpain inhibitors on the expression of drug-induced CPP lasted for at least 14 d. The inhibition of calpain without retrieval 6 h after retrieval or after exposure to an unpaired context had no effects on the expression of reward memory. Calpain inhibition after retrieval also decreased cocaine seeking in a self-administration model and this effect did not recover spontaneously after 28 d. Moreover, the knock-down of GRIP1 expression in the NAc core by lentivirus-mediated short-hairpin RNA blocked disruption of the reconsolidation of drug cue memories that was induced by calpain inhibitor treatment. These results suggest that calpain activity in the NAc core is crucial for the reconsolidation of drug reward memory via the regulation of GRIP1 expression. Calpain plays an important role in synaptic plasticity and long-term memory consolidation, however, its role in the reconsolidation of drug cue memory remains unknown. Using conditioned place preference and self-administration procedures, we found that exposure to drug-paired cues induced the activation of calpain and decreased glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core. The inhibition of calpain activity in the NAc core immediately after retrieval disrupted the reconsolidation of cocaine/morphine cue memory that was blocked by prior GRIP1 knock-down. Our findings indicate that calpain-GRIP signaling is essential for the restabilization process that is associated with drug cue memory and the inhibition of calpain activity may be a novel strategy for the prevention of drug relapse.",

        "abstract": "Brain mitochondrial dysfunction is hallmark pathology of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Recently, the role of synaptosomal mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of synaptic injury in AD has received increasing attention. Synaptosomal mitochondria are a subgroup of neuronal mitochondria specifically locating at synapses. They play an essential role in fueling synaptic functions by providing energy on the site; and their defects may lead to synaptic failure, which is an early and pronounced pathology in AD. In our previous studies we have determined early synaptosomal mitochondrial dysfunction in an AD animal model (J20 line) overexpressing human Amyloid beta (A\u03b2), the key mediator of AD. In view of the limitations of J20 line mice in representing the full aspects of amyloidopathy in AD cases, we employed 5xFAD mice which are thought to be a desirable paradigm of amyloidopathy as seen in AD subjects. In addition, we have also examined the status of synaptosomal mitochondrial dynamics as well as Parkin-mediated mitophagy which have not been previously investigated in this mouse model. In comparison to nontransgenic (nonTg mice), 5xFAD mice demonstrated prominent synaptosomal mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, synaptosomal mitochondria from the AD mouse model displayed imbalanced mitochondrial dynamics towards fission along with activated Parkin and LC3BII recruitment correlating to spatial learning u0026 memory impairments in 5xFAD mice in an age-dependent manner. These results suggest that synaptosomal mitochondrial deficits are primary pathology in A\u03b2-rich environments and further confirm the relevance of synaptosomal mitochondrial deficits to the development of AD.",

From 23 cross-sectional studies and five sets of baseline data, a high pooled prevalence of sleep disturbances (30.5%), depressive symptoms (18.1%) and coexisting disorders (10.6%) were found. In the 23 cohort studies, self-reported sleep disturbances increased the risk of the onset of depression (relative risk [RR]\u00a0=\u00a01.92). Persistent sleep disturbances increased the risk of the development (RR\u00a0=\u00a03.90), recurrence (RR\u00a0=\u00a07.70), and worsening (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.46) of depression in older adults. Little support was found for a predictive role for objective sleep characteristics in the development of depression. Older adults with depression had a higher risk of developing (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.72) and worsening (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.73) symptoms of sleep disturbances. This review emphasizes the importance of timely interventions in incipient sleep disturbances and depression among older adults, preventing the development of more serious comorbidities.",

        "abstract": "Abstract  Background  Substance use in young people is a global problem, with potential adverse effects on physical, mental, and social wellbeing. The situation of  use varies geographically worldwide. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the estimates of prevalence of  use in people aged 10\u201324 years in China.  Methods  We searched PubMed, Ovid, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wangfang Data for studies published before January, 2016, with a combination of search terms, including substance   medicine, adolescent or young people,  and the corresponding Chinese terms. We used the random-effect model or the fixed-effect model to estimate the prevalence of  use based on heterogeneity test. We did subgroup analysis and meta-regression to determine the effect of gender and school type on prevalence.  Findings  Among 2555 retrieved articles, 59 articles involving 531\u2008842 adolescents were eligible for the meta-analysis. The findings showed that, during their lifetime, the proportion of young people ever having used any of these substances was 59\u00b765% (95% CI 53\u00b737\u201365\u00b774) for alcohol, 23\u00b722% (20\u00b733\u201326\u00b711) for tobacco, 8\u00b722% (7\u00b714\u20139\u00b730) for sedatives, 6\u00b765% (3\u00b793\u20139\u00b737) for analgesics, 4\u00b780% (3\u00b775\u20135\u00b784) for solvents, and 1\u00b770% (1\u00b713\u20132\u00b726) for illicit drugs. The prevalence of  use in the past 30 days was as following: 27\u00b720% (95% CI 21\u00b738\u201333\u00b703) for alcohol, 10\u00b714% (8\u00b735\u201311\u00b792) for tobacco, 2\u00b779% (0\u00b714\u20135\u00b744) for solvents, 1\u00b730% (1\u00b729\u20131\u00b731) for illicit drugs, 1\u00b708% (0\u00b780\u20131\u00b736) for sedatives, and 0\u00b798% (0\u00b722\u20131\u00b774) for analgesics. Subgroups analysis showed that the lifetime prevalence of  use was higher in male adolescents than in female adolescents. Alcohol and sedatives were mostly used among college students, whereas tobacco, analgesics, and illicit drugs were mostly used among vocational school students. Compared with before 2010, illicit drug use increased after 2010 but tobacco and prescription medicines decreased. For prescription medicines, cough medicine was the most common medicine used non-medically, accounting for 3\u00b764% (95% CI 2\u00b772\u20134\u00b755), followed by diazepam, phenobarbital, and scopolamine hydrobromide tablets, tramadol, methaqualone, morphine, etc. For illicit drugs, methamphetamine was the most common illicit drug used (1\u00b706%; 0\u00b792\u20131\u00b720), followed by ketamine, ecstasy, heroin, cannabis, and cocaine.  Interpretation  Substance use is common among young people in China, particularly alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs. Itu0027s urgent to take comprehensive measures to prevent adolescents  use, especially for vocational and college students.

        "abstract": "Morinda officinalis oligosaccharides (MOs) have been reported to exert neuroprotective and antidepressant-like effects in the forced swim test (FST) in mice. However, the mechanisms that underlie the antidepressant-like effects of MOs are unclear.Chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) and FST were used to explore the antidepressant-like effects of MOs and resilience to stress in rats. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was microinjected in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to explore the role of GSK-3\u03b2 in the antidepressant-like effects of MOs. The expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), phosphorylated-Ser9-glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2), \u03b2-catenin, and synaptic proteins was determined in the mPFC and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) by Western blot.We found that MOs effectively ameliorated CUS-induced depression-like behaviors in the sucrose preference test (SPT) and FST. The MOs also significantly rescued CUS-induced abnormalities in the BDNF-GSK-3\u03b2-\u03b2-catenin pathway and synaptic protein deficits in the mPFC but not OFC. The activation of GSK-3\u03b2 by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 abolished the antidepressant-like effects of MOs in the FST. Na\u00efve rats that were treated with MOs exhibited resilience to CUS, accompanied by increases in the expression of BDNF, phosphorylated-Ser9-GSK-3\u03b2, and \u03b2-catenin in the mPFC.Our findings indicate that the BDNF-GSK-3\u03b2-\u03b2-catenin pathway in the mPFC may underlie the antidepressant-like effect of MOs and resilience to stress.",

Among 1277 MA users, 57.6% participants had any type of psychiatric symptoms including depressive, anxiety and psychotic symptoms. A dose-response relationship was found between duration of MA use and risk of psychiatric symptoms. The odds ratios (OR) of depressive symptoms increased with the duration of MA use (1-5 years vs. <\u202f1 year: 1.74 [95% CI, 1.24-2.42]; \u2265\u202f5 years vs. <\u202f1 year: 2.07 [1.19-3.61]), so did the ORs of co-occurring anxiety and depressive symptoms (1-5 years: 1.74 [1.20-2.51]; \u2265\u202f5 years: 3.09 [1.76-5.40]). Methamphetamine-dependent individuals were four-times more likely to experience any type of psychiatric symptoms than non-dependent users. The prevalence of psychiatric symptoms was high in chronic MA users and increased with MA use duration. Early prevention and treatment strategies targeting both MA use and associated psychiatric symptoms are needed.",

        "abstract": "Immune dysregulation, specifically of inflammatory processes, has been linked to behavioral symptoms of depression in both human and rodent studies. Here, we evaluated the antidepressant effects of immunization with altered peptide ligands of myelin basic protein (MBP)-MBP[A, A], MBP[A], and MBP[R, A]-in different models of depression and examined the mechanism by which these peptides protect against stress-induced depression. We found that a single dose of subcutaneously administered MBP[A, A] produced antidepressant-like effects by decreasing immobility in the forced swim test and by reducing the escape latency and escape failures in the learned helplessness paradigm. Moreover, immunization with MBP[A, A] prevented and reversed depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviors that were induced by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). However, MBP[R, A] tended to aggravate CUS-induced anxiety-like behavior. Chronic stress increased the production of peripheral and central proinflammatory cytokines and induced the activation of microglia in the prelimbic cortex (PrL), which was blocked by MBP[A, A]. Immunization with MBP-derived altered peptide ligands also rescued chronic stress-induced deficits in p11, phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression. Moreover, microinjections of recombinant proinflammatory cytokines and the knockdown of p11 in the PrL blunted the antidepressant-like behavioral response to MBP[A, A]. Altogether, these findings indicate that immunization with altered MBP peptide produces prolonged antidepressant-like effects in rats, and the behavioral response is mediated by inflammatory factors (particularly interleukin-6), and p11 signaling in the PrL. Immune-neural interactions may impact central nervous system function and alter an individual's response to stress.",

        "abstract": "Depression is one of the most common and debilitating psychiatric illnesses around the world, but the current antidepressants used to treat depression have many limitations. Progressively more studies have shown that neuropeptide systems are potential novel therapeutic targets for depression. However, whether the neuropeptide trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) participates in the development of depression has not been examined. In the current experiments, we assessed the antidepressant effects of TFF3 using the forced swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), and chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm. Furthermore, we determined the mechanism that underlies the antidepressant-like effects of TFF3 in the rat FST. TFF3 dose-dependently reduced immobility time in both FST and TST. CMS elevated plasma TFF3 and decreased basolateral amygdala (BLA) TFF3 levels in rats, and acute TFF3 (0.1\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) treatment reversed the depressive-like behaviors induced by CMS. Furthermore, TFF3 (0.1\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) significantly increased Fos expression in the BLA, medial prefrontal cortex, and hypothalamus in rats subjected to the FST. Intra-BLA infusions of TFF3 (1\u2009ng/side) exerted rapid antidepressant-like effects in the rat FST. Additionally, acute systemic TFF3 administration increased the level of phosphorylated-Akt (p-Akt) in the BLA. Finally, intra-BLA infusions of LY294002 (5\u2009mM/side), a specific phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, significantly blocked the antidepressant-like effect of TFF3. Our results demonstrated that TFF3 exerts antidepressant-like effects that might be mediated by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in the BLA. These findings suggest a novel neuropeptide system target in the development of new antidepressants.",

A cross-sectional study was conducted between April, 2012 and October, 2015 among individuals for whom MA was the principal drug of use in a Compulsory Drug Detoxification Center in Beijing, Guangdong Province. Demographic, drug use and psychological characteristics were examined using a specifically-designed questionnaire, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Barratt Impulsive Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale and Beck Depression Inventory. Logistic regression was performed to explore the risk factors for MA-associated psychotic symptoms.  A total of 1685 participants were included. Participants were predominantly aged 30 or above, unemployed, and were unmarried Han Chinese men, with limited education. The duration of MA use was more than 3 months in 72.3%. 47.8% reported that the dose of MA use was \u2265 0.2 g per occasion of use. 11.5% had used two or more synthetic drugs. The prevalence of MA-associated psychotic symptoms was 17.0% among MA users during periods of abstinence. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that a higher dose (\u22650.2 g per time), a longer duration of MA use (>3 months) a history of heroin use and a history of tobacco use were associated with MA-associated psychotic symptoms, with adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of 1.96 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.40-2.76), 1.98 (95% CI: 1.33-2.96) and 2.45 (95% CI: 1.67-3.60), 1.78 (95% CI: 1.27-2.49) respectively. MA-associated psychotic symptoms were less common among married/cohabitating than unmarried (OR = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.39-0.81), and unemployed than employed (OR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.47-0.92) individuals. MA users with anxiety and depression symptoms had significantly greater risk for MA-associated psychotic symptoms by 9.70 (6.92-13.59) and 1.90 (1.36-2.65) times respectively. Individuals with higher impulsivity were more likely to have MA-associated psychotic symptoms than those with lower (OR = 2.19; CI:1.50-3.20).  MA-associated psychotic symptoms occurred frequently among MA users in China. The efforts that facilitate drug users' attempts to reduce MA use, abstain from poly-drug use, and control associated psychiatric symptoms and impulsivity should be supported because of their potential contribution to MA-associated psychotic symptoms in this population.",

        "abstract": "Postretrieval extinction procedures are effective nonpharmacological interventions for disrupting drug-associated memories. Nonetheless, the conditioned stimulus (CS) memory retrieval-extinction procedure is ineffective in inhibiting drug craving and relapse after prolonged withdrawal, which significantly undermines its therapeutic potential. In the present study, we showed that, unlike the CS memory retrieval-extinction procedure, noncontingent heroin injections (unconditioned stimulus [UCS]) 1\u00a0hour before the extinction sessions decreased the heroin-priming-induced reinstatement, renewal, and spontaneous recovery of heroin seeking after 28\u00a0days of withdrawal (ie, remote heroin-associated memories) in rats. The UCS retrieval manipulation induced reactivation of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) after prolonged withdrawal, and this reactivation was absent with the CS retrieval manipulation. Chemogenetic inactivation of the BLA abolished the inhibitory effect of the UCS memory retrieval-extinction procedure on heroin-priming-induced reinstatement after prolonged withdrawal. Furthermore, the combination of chemogenetic reactivation of BLA and CS retrieval-extinction procedure resembled the inhibitory effect of UCS retrieval-extinction procedure on heroin seeking after prolonged withdrawal. We also observed that the inhibitory effect of the UCS retrieval-extinction procedure is mediated by regulation of AMPA receptor endocytosis in the BLA. Our results demonstrate critical engagement of the BLA in reconsolidation updating of heroin-associated memory after prolonged withdrawal, extending our knowledge of the boundary conditions of the reconsolidation of drug-associated memories.",

        "abstract": "This review extends a prior meta-analysis of acupuncture's utility for treating opioid detoxification, addressing the efficacy of acupuncture when combined with allopathic therapies. Both English and Chinese databases were searched for randomized trials comparing acupuncture combined with opioid agonist treatment versus opioid agonists alone for treating symptoms of opioid withdrawal. The methodological quality of each study was assessed with Jadad's scale (1-2 = low; 3-5 = high). Meta-analysis was performed with fixed- or random-effect models in RevMan software; the outcome measures assessed were withdrawal-symptoms score, relapse rate, side effects, and medication dosage. Withdrawal-symptom scores were lower in combined treatment trials than in agonist-alone trials on withdrawal days 1, 7, 9, and 10. Combined treatment also produced lower reported rates of side effects and appeared to lower the required dose of opioid agonist. There was no significant difference on relapse rate after 6 months. This meta-analysis suggests that acupuncture combined with opioid agonists can effectively be used to manage the withdrawal symptoms. One limitation of this meta-analysis is the poor quality of the methodology of some included trials. High-quality studies are needed to confirm findings regarding the side effects and medication dosage.",

        "abstract": "Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic drug primarily characterized by partial agonist activity at dopamine(DA) D2 receptors and serotonin-1A (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT1A) receptors and minimal side effects.Based on its pharmacological profile, including stabilization of mesocorticolimbic DA activity (a pathway implicated in drug addiction), we investigated the effects of aripiprazole on relapse to morphine seeking in rats. In experiment 1, rats underwent morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) training with alternate injections of morphine (5 mg/kg, s.c.) and saline (1 ml/kg, s.c.) for 8 consecutive days. To examine the effect of aripiprazole on the expression of morphine-induced CPP, rats received aripiprazole (0, 0.03, 0.1,and 0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min before testing for the expression of CPP. In experiment 2, rats underwent the same CPP training as in experiment 1 and subsequent extinction training. To examine the effect of aripiprazole on reinstatement of morphine-induced CPP, rats received aripiprazole 30 min before testing for reinstatement of CPP. In experiment 3, to assess the effects of aripiprazole on locomotor activity, aripiprazole was administered 30 min before testing for locomotor activity. Aripiprazole significantly decreased the reinstatement of CPP induced by a priming injection of morphine but had no effect on the expression of morphine-induced CPP or locomotor activity. The D2 and 5-HT1A partial agonist and 5-HT2A antagonist properties of aripiprazole likely account for the blockade of relapse to drug seeking. These findings suggest that aripiprazole may have therapeutic value for reducing craving and preventing relapse to drug seeking.",

To date, the potential effects of sucrose intake on the extinction and drug-induced reinstatement of CPP have not been determined. In the present study, sucrose solution (15%) was given prior to, during, and following the acquisition of morphine-induced CPP. Place preference was subsequently assessed during expression, extinction, and morphine-induced reinstatement. The results showed that the sucrose solution given prior to place conditioning training transiently suppressed the expression of morphine CPP. Sucrose solution given during place conditioning training had no effects on the expression, extinction, and reinstatement of CPP. When the sucrose solution was given following the acquisition of morphine CPP, the extinction of morphine CPP was accelerated, and morphine-induced reinstatement was profoundly inhibited. The above results demonstrated that sucrose intake could differentially affect the expression, extinction, and reinstatement of morphine-induced CPP, depending on the interference schedules. Our findings suggest that offering non-drug rewards could be a valuable approach to maintain abstinence and preventing relapse in drug addicts.",

Intracranial injections of the nonselective CRF receptor antagonist D-Phe-CRF into the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), but not the amygdala, attenuate footshock-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. However, the brain sites involved in the effect of CP-154,526 on footshock-induced reinstatement of opiate seeking are unknown.We used a CPP version of the reinstatement model to examine the role of CRF1 receptors in the BNST, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens (NAc) in footshock- or drug-priming-induced reinstatement of extinguished morphine CPP.Rats acquired morphine CPP over a period of 8 days during which they were given four morphine (10 mg/kg s.c.) and four saline injections and were subsequently confined to distinct chambers for 50 min. Subsequently, the morphine CPP was extinguished in 14 daily sessions during which rats were given saline injections and given access to both the saline- and morphine-paired chambers. The rats were then tested for reinstatement of morphine CPP induced by priming injections of morphine (0 or 3.0 mg/kg s.c.) or by exposure to intermittent footshock (15 min, 0.5 mA).

        "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that cannabinoid CB 1 receptors may represent effective targets for therapeutic agents used to treat cocaine and heroin relapse. However, the role of cannabinoid CB 1 receptors in the potential treatment for other drugs of abuse is still largely unknown. The present study was conducted to determine whether cannabinoid CB 1 receptors play a similar role in relapse to ketamine abuse. To establish a ketamine reinstatement model in the conditioned place preference paradigm, rats were trained to develop place preference conditioned by ketamine, which was subsequently extinguished through daily exposure to the test chambers in the absence of ketamine. On the day following the last extinction session, four groups of rats were injected with ketamine (1, 5, 10 and 15\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) to reinstate previously extinguished conditioned place preference. To investigate the effects of rimonabant, a cannabinoid CB 1 receptor antagonist, on reinstatement of ketamine-induced place preference, different doses of rimonabant (0.1, 0.5 and 3\u00a0mg/kg, i.p) were injected 30\u00a0min prior to the ketamine (5 and 15\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) priming injection in a separate group of rats. To determine whether rimonabant itself produces conditioned place preference or conditioned place aversion, rats were trained for conditioned place preference or place aversion with rimonabant (0, 0.1, 0.5, 3.0\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.). While ketamine priming injections reinstated extinguished place preference, rimonabant administration significantly attenuated the reinstatement of ketamine-induced place preference in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, rimonabant itself did not produce conditioned place preference or place aversion. Since the reinstatement effects of ketamine administration were inhibited by rimonabant, these findings suggest that a cannabinoid CB 1 receptor antagonist may be useful in preventing relapse to ketamine abuse.",

        "abstract": "The conditioned place preference (CPP) model has been widely used to evaluate the rewarding effects of abused drugs, and recently, the extinction and reinstatement phases of this paradigm have been used to assess relapse to drug seeking. The vast majority of studies have focused on CPP induced by illicit drugs, such as psychostimulants and opioids. Although legal psychoactive drugs, such as ethanol, nicotine, and caffeine, are more widely used than illegal drugs, the establishment, extinction, and reinstatement of CPP produced by these licit drugs are less well understood. The present review discusses the extant research on CPP induced by legal drugs. We first describe the CPP model and discuss the behavioral procedures used to induce CPP for ethanol, nicotine, and caffeine. We then summarize the neuronal substrates that underlie CPP induced by these drugs from a genetic perspective. Finally, we draw on findings from pharmacological studies and discuss the neurotransmitters and neurohormones underlying CPP produced by ethanol, nicotine, and caffeine.",

As stress plays a critical role in processes of alcohol addiction, we tested whether stress is involved in alcohol vulnerability differently during adolescence and adulthood in mice.To determine whether age differences exist in the acquisition of alcohol-conditioned place preference (CPP) in mice, adolescent and adult mice were trained for CPP with different doses of alcohol (0, 0.5, 1, and 2 g/kg, i.p.). To explore the effects of stress (footshock) on acquisition of alcohol CPP in mice of different ages, adolescent and adult mice underwent acute (1 day) or chronic (1 week) stress before CPP training. Acquisition of CPP was examined after the CPP training.Under nonstress conditions, adult mice acquired alcohol CPP when trained with 2 g/kg alcohol, while adolescent mice did not acquire alcohol CPP. After chronic but not acute stress exposure, adolescent mice acquired significant CPP trained with 2 g/kg alcohol that did not produce CPP under nonstress conditions. However, stress did not have significant effect on acquisition of CPP in adult mice trained CPP with 1 g/kg alcohol.These results indicate that there is an age difference in acquiring alcohol CPP and adolescent mice are more sensitive than adults to stress.",

        "abstract": "Persistent memory associated with addictive drugs contributes to the relapse of drug abuse. The current study was conducted to examine the effects of scopolamine and ketamine on reconsolidation of morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). In experiment 1, after morphine CPP was acquired, rats were injected with ketamine (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and scopolamine (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), respectively, after reexposure to an earlier morphine-paired context or in their home cages. The CPP was reassessed 24 and 48 h after reexposure. An additional group of rats received saline following reexposure to the earlier morphine-paired context. In experiment 2, two groups of rats were only given saline during the CPP training and subsequent administration of ketamine or scopolamine during the reexposure. In experiment 1, rats failed to exhibit morphine CPP when ketamine and scopolamine were administered only after reexposure to a morphine-paired context. CPP was not abolished by ketamine or scopolamine administration in the animals' home cages. Also, the animals receiving only saline injections showed strong morphine CPP 24 h after a short exposure to the morphine-paired context. In experiment 2, ketamine or scopolamine treatment alone did not induce CPP or aversion. Administration of scopolamine and ketamine, after reexposure to a drug-paired context, resulted in the disruption of morphine CPP, suggesting the potential effects of scopolamine and ketamine in disrupting memory associated with environmental cues and addictive drugs.",

        "abstract": "Cytokine interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) is an immunomodulator and neuromodulator, which modulates central nervous system function partially by activating opioid receptors. However, the role that IFN-alpha plays in relapse to drug abuse is still largely unknown. Thus, we studied whether human recombinant INF-alpha (rIFN-alpha) would reinstate morphine-conditioned place preference (CPP) in rats. In Experiment 1, rats were trained for morphine-CPP with 8-day alternate subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of morphine and saline, and the effect of human rIFN-alpha (20 000 IU/5 microl, intracerebroventricularly) on CPP reinstatement was examined after extinction. In Experiment 2, rats underwent morphine (5 mg/kg, s.c.) unconditioned training with 8 daily alternate injections of morphine (5 mg/kg, s.c.) and saline. Then, the effect of human rIFN-alpha (20 000 IU/5 microl, intracerebroventricularly) on reinstatement of CPP was examined after extinction. In Experiment 3, the effect of opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) on human rIFN-alpha-induced reinstatement of morphine-CPP was investigated. We found that human rIFN-alpha reinstated morphine-CPP in rats trained under morphine conditioning after extinction, but did not affect CPP in rats that underwent unconditioned training. Naloxone significantly inhibited human rIFN-alpha-induced reinstatement of morphine-CPP. These results indicate that IFN-alpha is a stimulus for reinstatement of morphine-CPP by activation of opioid receptors, which extends our understanding on the high comorbidity of heroin relapse and viral infection.",

        "abstract": "The effect of noradrenaline in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and locus coeruleus on maintenance and reactivation of morphine-conditioned place preference induced by footshock stress was investigated in rats. After receiving alternate injection of morphine (10 mg/kg) and saline for 6 consecutive days, the rats spent more time in the drug-paired compartment (morphine-conditioned place preference) on day 7. These animals did not show morphine-conditioned place preference on day 37 following sham-footshock once every 3 days from days 8 to 36 (28 days drug-free). However, 15 min of intermittent footshock once every 3 days could induce the maintenance of morphine-conditioned place preference on day 37 with significantly more time spent in the drug-paired compartment than on day 0. Microinjection of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine (0.1 or 1 microg), into the locus coeruleus 30 min before footshock did not affect stress-induced maintenance of conditioned place preference. However, infusions of clonidine (1 microg) into the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis significantly attenuated the maintenance of conditioned place preference induced by footshock stress. In another experiment, after a 21-day extinction of morphine-conditioned place preference, a single footshock could reactivate the morphine place preference that was significantly blocked by pretreatment with infusion of clonidine (0.1 or 1 microg) into the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis but not the locus coeruleus. Reactivation of morphine-conditioned place preference elicited by footshock stress was significantly inhibited by 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesions in the ventral noradrenergic bundle, most of the norepinephrine input to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis arising from caudal brain stem noradrenergic cell groups. In contrast, chemical lesions of the dorsal noradrenergic bundle that arises from the locus coeruleus had no such effects. These findings suggest that noradrenergic neurons in locus coeruleus are not involved in stress-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking and further clearly demonstrate that noradrenaline in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis plays a critical role in mediating this effect. Comprehension of the neurochemical events underlying the stress-induced and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis-mediated reinstatement of drug-seeking may, therefore, throw more light on the biological bases of drug dependence and addictive behavior",

Intraperitoneal injection of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C, 1 mg/kg) was used to trigger an immune challenge. Conditioned place preference (CPP) in rats trained with alternating subcutaneous injections of morphine (5 mg/kg) and saline was used to assess the rewarding effect of morphine. Poly I:C administered before CPP training had no effects on CPP acquisition. Poly I:C administered during CPP training enhanced CPP acquisition. Poly I:C administered after morphine-induced CPP acquisition retarded CPP extinction.

        "title": "Increased S100B serum levels in schizophrenic patients with tardive dyskinesia: Association with dyskinetic movements",
        "abstract": "Several studies show that calcium-binding protein S100B is increased in schizophrenia and may be involved in the pathogenesis of tardive dyskinesia (TD). We therefore compared serum S100B levels in normal controls ( n = 60), schizophrenic patients with ( n = 32) and without TD ( n = 50). Assessments included the abnormal involuntary movement scale (AIMS) and the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). Serum S100B levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results indicated that patients with TD had higher serum S100B levels than normals and those without TD. Serum S100B levels were positively correlated with AIMS scores in patients with TD. These data suggest that increased S100B levels may be related to neuro-degeneration, associated with TD pathophysiology. Keywords Tardive dyskinesia Schizophrenia S100B Antipsychotic treatment 1 Introduction Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a syndrome characterized by involuntary dyskinetic movements usually involving the perioral region and limbs occurring in 20\u201350% of patients treated chronically with antipsychotics ( Correll and Schenk, 2008; Remington, 2007 ). TD is associated with poor quality of life, increased medical morbidity and mortality ( Correll and Schenk, 2008; Remington, 2007 ). There are presenting no well-accepted treatments for TD and its pathophysiology was poorly delineated. However, evidence suggests that TD is associated with neuro-degeneration, thus markers that relate to this process may help define this syndrome. One such protein is the calcium-binding protein S100B ( Lohr, 1991; Lohr and Browning, 1995; Lohr et al., 2003; Rothermundt et al., 2004a ). S100B is found predominantly in the cytosol of glial cells in all parts of the central nervous system (CNS) and in some peripheral structures ( Donato, 2001; Steiner et al., 2007, 2008 ). Astroctyes produce and secrete calcium-binding protein S100B which supports neuronal proliferation, differentiation and plasticity, but is also released from damaged astrocytes and is considered a marker of structural damage ( Rothermundt et al., 2004b ). For example, large concentrations of S100B are present in the CSF of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, ischemic brain damage, epilepsy and traumatic brain injury presumably released from compromised astrocytes ( Hu et al., 1997; Schmitt et al., 2008, 2009; van Beveren et al., 2006 ), that can be detected in peripheral circulation ( Schmitt et al., 2005 ). Recent studies show that S100B is increased in the serum and CSF of unmedicated and medicated schizophrenic patients ( Lara et al., 2001; Ling et al., 2007; Rothermundt et al., 2001, 2007; Sarandol et al., 2007; Schroeter et al., 2003; Wiesmann et al., 1999 ). High levels are correlated with negative or motor deficit symptoms and in those with slower symptomology improvement over time ( Ling et al., 2007; Rothermundt et al., 2001, 2004c; Sarandol et al., 2007; Schmitt et al., 2005; Schroeter et al., 2003 ). Thus, an obvious question to assess is whether S100B may be related to presumed neuronal damage in neuroleptic-induced TD. To our knowledge, no published studies have examined S100B levels in patients with TD. Based on the association of S100B with a poor prognosis type of schizophrenia and various degenerative brain diseases, we hypothesized that increased S100B may be associated with developing TD in schizophrenic patients. 2 Methods 2.1 Subjects All patients satisfied DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia. Psychiatric diagnosis was made by consensus of two experienced clinical psychiatrists based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. TD was diagnosed using the criteria of Schooler and Kane ( Schooler and Kane, 1982 ). Dyskinesia was classified as present in a subject with an AIMS score of at least three (moderate degree) in any body part or with at least two (mild degree) in two or more body parts. Each item on the AIMS ranges from 0 to 4, and the total AIMS score was calculated by adding items 1\u20137. Patients with TD were re-evaluated one month later for TD using the AIMS, and diagnosed with TD only if both evaluations concluded TD. Using this method of diagnosis, two TD patients were excluded from the study. The patients with TD ( n = 32) and those without TD ( n = 50) were selected from among the inpatients. All patients were selected from our schizophrenic patient population, were of the chronic type, with an average illness course of 26.6 \u00b1 8.7 years. They had been receiving stable doses of oral neuroleptic medications for at least 12 months. The medications that patients had been taking were either clozapine (11 TD vs. 20 non-TD), risperidone (8 TD vs. 14 non-TD), perphenazine (4 TD vs. 5 non-TD), chlorpromazine (3 TD vs. 3 non-TD), haloperidol (4 TD vs. 4 non-TD), and sulpiride (2 TD vs. 4 non-TD). Healthy Han Chinese control subjects ( n = 60) were selectively recruited from the local community, and matched for age and gender. All subjects were Han Chinese from Beijing area. Both patients and matched normal subjects had similar socioeconomic status and dietary patterns. The groups did not differ significantly in age, gender, education and smoking status ( Table 1 ). A complete medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests were obtained from all the subjects. Any subject with drug and alcohol abuse/dependence or poor health was excluded. All subjects gave signed, informed consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board, Beijing HuiLongGuan Hospital. 2.2 Clinical measures The severity of tardive dyskinesia was assessed by the same experienced investigator blinded to the patient\u2019s serum S100B and clinical status, using the abnormal involuntary movement scale (AIMS). The patients\u2019 psychopathology was assessed on the day of the blood sampling using the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS), which was measured by two psychiatrists, who had simultaneously attended a training session in the use of the PANSS before this study started. After training, repeated assessments for the PANSS total score maintained an inter-rater correlation coefficient greater than 0.8. 2.3 S100B measurement in serum Serum samples were collected between 07.00 and 09.00 h following an overnight fast. Serum S100B levels were measured in duplicate in all subjects by sandwich ELISA using a commercially available kit (R&D systems, Beijing, China). A full description of the assays has been given in our previous report ( Qi et al., 2009 ). All samples were assayed by the same investigator, who was blind to the clinical situation. The sensitivity of the assay was 0.1 ng/ml. Inter- and intra-assay variation coefficients were 6% and 4%, respectively. 2.4 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Post hoc tests were conducted to determine the difference between groups, followed by Fisher\u2019s least significant difference (LSD) test. The effect of age, sex, duration of illness and neuroleptic dose were tested by adding these variables to the analysis model as covariates. Relationships between variables were assessed with Pearson\u2019s product moment correlation coefficients. Bonferroni corrections were applied to each test to adjust for multiple testing. Stepwise multiple regression analysis using the AIMS total score as the dependent variable investigated the impact of the related clinical variables. 3 Results There was no significant difference in age, gender or education among the three groups. Also there were no significant differences of PANSS total score and its sub-scores between patients with TD and patients without TD ( Table 1 ). Patient\u2019s AIMS score with or without TD was significantly correlated with age ( r = 0.42, n = 32, p = 0.03), but not with duration of illness, age of onset of psychosis, number of hospitalizations or with the PANSS scales. Medication types were similar between the TD and non-TD groups ( p > 0.05). Nineteen TD patients (59.4%) and 34 non-TD patients (68.0%) received atypical antipsychotics, without a significant difference in the atypical/typical antipsychotics between TD and non-TD patients ( X 2 = 0.64, df = 1, p = 0.43). Moreover, no significant difference was noted in daily doses of antipsychotics converted to approximate daily mean chlorpromazine mg equivalents using standard guidelines ( Woods, 2003 ), and in duration of current antipsychotic treatments (both p > 0.05) ( Table 1 ). Both TD and non-TD patients received the similar treatments, and TD patients did not receive specific treatments. According to the TD definition however, there was significant difference in AIMS total score between TD and non-TD groups (5.52 \u00b1 2.58 vs. 0.63 \u00b1 0.86, p < 0.001). Serum S100B levels were significantly higher in patients with TD than in those without TD (0.39 \u00b1 0.10 ng/ml vs. 0.32 \u00b1 0.12 ng/ml; F = 6.3, df = 1, 80, p = 0.014). This difference remained significant after covarying for sex, age, illness of duration and neuroleptic dose ( F = 5.6, df = 5, 72, p = 0.021). Furthermore, both patient groups were higher than the controls (0.12 \u00b1 0.06 ng/ml) (TD vs. controls: p = 0.000; non-TD vs. control: p = 0.004). These differences remained significant after covarying for sex, age, and education (TD vs. controls: p = 0.000; non-TD vs. control: p = 0.002). Serum S100B levels were similar in typical and atypical antipsychotic treated patients (0.33 \u00b1 0.12 ng/ml vs. 0.36 \u00b1 0.11 ng/ml; F = 0.67, df = 1, 80, p = 0.43), and neither neuroleptic dose (chlorpromazine equivalents) nor treatment duration significantly correlated with serum S100B levels ( r = \u22120.02, df = 82, p = 0.82; r = \u22120.04, df = 79, p = 0.73). S100B levels were positively correlated with the AIMS score in patients with TD ( r = 0.51, df = 32, p = 0.007) ( Fig. 1 ). In schizophrenic patients with or without TD grouped together, S100B levels were also positively correlated with the AIMS score ( r = 0.35, df = 82, p = 0.003). However, as a group, S100B levels were not associated with any psychopathological parameters shown on PANSS (all p > 0.05). Stepwise multiple regression analysis using AIMS as dependent variable was performed in the TD patients to investigate the impact of including age, gender, education, serum S100B levels, duration of illness, age of onset, smoking, hospitalization, antipsychotic agent type, dose and duration of treatment, and PANSS and its subscales. This analysis identified S100B levels ( \u03b2 = 0.34, t = 3.06, p = 0.003), age ( \u03b2 = 0.27, t = 2.38, p = 0.02) and the negative symptom sub-score of PANSS ( \u03b2 = 0.23, t = 2.02, p = 0.047) as the only significant covariates, which together accounted for 27% of the variance in the AIMS. 4 Discussion Our data showed that serum S100B levels were significantly higher in schizophrenic patients than in normal controls, and higher in TD than non-TD patients. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing higher peripheral levels of S100B in patients with TD. Moreover, S100B levels are positively correlated with AIMS scores, as a measure of the severity of TD symptoms. These findings suggest that S100B may be a significant marker associated with the pathophysiology of TD. Increased S100B serum levels in chronic schizophrenic patients with or without TD in our present study is supported by recent studies ( Lara et al., 2001; Ling et al., 2007; Rothermundt et al., 2001, 2007; Sarandol et al., 2007; Schroeter et al., 2003; Wiesmann et al., 1999 ). Serum S100B levels also appear to reliably reflect S100B concentrations in the CSF of healthy controls ( Nygaard et al., 1997 ) and of various neurological diseases ( van Beveren et al., 2006 ). Recently, Rothermundt et al. reported that increased serum S100B concentrations correlated with increased CSF S100B in schizophrenic patients ( Rothermundt et al., 2004a ). Schizophrenic patients with elevated serum S100B also have increased concentrations of brain myo-inositol; a marker of neural and glial damage ( Rothermundt et al., 2007 ). Therefore, serum S100B levels in schizophrenic patients could be used to infer S100B concentrations in the brain, and be a potential biomarker of neural and glial damage that may relate to either the onset or progression of TD. The mechanisms underlying the elevated serum S100B levels in schizophrenia are still unknown. S100B is released from damaged or stimulated astrocytes into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and then released into the peripheral ( Schmitt et al., 2005 ). Thus, increased S100B serum levels may signal astrocytic injury and/or of astrocytic response to neuronal injury ( Pedersen et al., 2008 ). However, the source of increased circulating S100B in patients with schizophrenia remains unclear. Although S100B is predominantly expressed in astrocytes, it is also present in other brain cells such as oligodendrocytes, microglial or even neuronal cells ( Steiner et al., 2007 ). In addition, other potential explanations for increased S100B concentrations should be considered; for example, the increased S100B could be related to inflammatory processes. Indeed, recent studies demonstrated increased S100 levels in CSF are present in various inflammatory and infectious brain diseases suggesting immune cell injury in brain ( Rothermundt et al., 2003 ). Furthermore, a genetic polymorphism of the S100B gene has been identified in schizophrenic patients among Chinese ( Liu et al., 2005 ). This polymorphism may be functional in that S100B protein levels and mRNA expression are dependent on this gene polymorphism ( Hohoff et al., 2009 ). Therefore, it is possible that the findings of the present study might be due to genetic polymorphisms rather than tardive dyskinesia. However, a more likely explanation is that chronic disease and probable antipsychotic-induced glial cell damage relates more to S100B levels. Indeed, a recent preclinical study in non-human primates reported that chronic haloperidol and olanzapine treatment is associated with decreased grey matter density and decreased glial cell numbers ( Konopaske et al., 2008 ). However, the relationship between serum S100B, decreased astrocytes induced by chronic antipsychotic exposure in schizophrenic patients with and without TD has yet to be revealed. Our data suggest that elevated S100B is probably a risk factor for TD which may indicate neuronal cell damage. Studies show that whereas low concentrations have growth enhancing and supportive effects on neurons, high concentrations of S100B appear to do the opposite ( Donato, 2001; Rothermundt et al., 2003, 2004b ). Nanomolar concentrations of S100B appear to have neuroprotective effects, stimulate neurite and astrocyte outgrowth and enhance survival of neurons during development, whereas micromolar concentrations produce neuro-degeneration and induce apoptosis ( van Beveren et al., 2006 ). Thus, logically, an increase in peripheral levels of S100B seen in our study may be related to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia or of TD ( Hu et al., 1997; Pedersen et al., 2008 ). Because of our design study however, we obviously cannot assign causality between elevated S100B levels and TD. Moreover, whether the S100B values measured are high enough to make degeneration with cell lose is still unknown. Post-mortem and neuroimaging studies correlating synaptic and neurodegenerative changes with S100B levels in TD-related regions, such as basal ganglia, would help define this relationship. This study has a number of limitations. First, we were not able to define the total period of neuroleptic use in terms of cumulative lifetime chlorpromazine equivalents dosage. This information is of value regarding the development of TD. Second, the possible confounders, such as clozapine treatment in the current study should be considered. The percentage of the TD and non-TD patients in our study who were taking clozapine was 34% and 40%, respectively, which is much higher than that in the Western patients with schizophrenia. However, this high percentage of clozapine use in schizophrenia was the treatment of choice for schizophrenia. Recently, it was reported that about 25\u201360% of all treated patients with schizophrenia receive clozapine, and clozapine is currently the most commonly used treatment for schizophrenia in China ( Tang et al., 2008 ). Different doctors did not have different indications for prescribing clozapine. Yet there was no significant difference in the prevalence of the TD in those on clozapine compared to those taking typical antipsychotic agents. Moreover, S100B does not differ in clozapine and typical antipsychotic-treated patients ( Qi et al., 2009 ). Hence, increased S100B serum levels in TD patients may be not related to the effect of antipsychotic drugs, but tardive dyskinesia itself. Third, all patients with TD in our study were chronically ill, with the average duration of TD of 13 years, and most of them had been taking antipsychotic drugs for a long-term period so our results might not be generalizable to all TD patients. It might be anticipated that those patients with more recent onset TD might be expected to show different abnormalities in S100B, or at least a closer dyskinesia\u2013S100B relationship than those patients who have had TD for many years. However, most of TD patients had a rather long duration of TD, and only five patients had the duration of TD less than 5 years in our present study. Hence, the further examination of relationship between the duration of TD and S100B in a sample including short (\u2a7d5 years) and long duration of TD could be more fruitful. In summary, our study indicated that patients with TD had higher serum S100B levels than normals and those without TD. Serum S100B levels were positively correlated with AIMS scores in patients with TD. These data suggest that increased S100B may play an important role in the pathophysiology of TD, and there may be a relationship between increased S100B levels and dyskinetic movements associated with TD. Our results support the hypothesis that TD is associated with neuro-degeneration. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the increased S100B levels in TD and the causality between elevated S100B levels and TD are still unknown. Post-mortem and neuroimaging studies correlating synaptic and neurodegenerative changes with S100B levels in TD-related regions, such as basal ganglia, would help define this relationship.

        "abstract": "Objective\u00a0\u00a0Both schizophrenia and oxidative stress have been associated with immune system abnormalities in interleukin-2 and -6 (IL-2;\n IL-6) and increases in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. These abnormalities may improve during antipsychotic drug treatment\n that reduces symptoms in schizophrenic patients.\n \n \n \n Materials and methods\u00a0\u00a0Subjects included 30 healthy controls (HC) and 78 schizophrenic (SCH) in-patients who were randomly assigned to 12\u00a0weeks of\n double-blind treatment with risperidone 6\u00a0mg/day or haloperidol 20\u00a0mg/day. Ratings using the Positive and Negative Syndrome\n Scale (PANSS) were correlated with blood SOD and serum IL-2 levels.\n \n \n \n Results\u00a0\u00a0SCH patients who were medication-free for 2\u00a0weeks had greater SOD, IL-2, and IL-6 levels than HC. At baseline, these SOD elevations\n were associated with higher PANSS total scores and the IL-2 elevations with lower PANSS positive symptom scores. The SOD and\n IL-2 levels in the SCH were also positively correlated. After treatment, PANSS positive symptoms and both SOD and IL-2 showed\n a significant decrease, but IL-6 showed no change. The SOD and IL-2 reductions were correlated with the reductions in PANSS\n total score, and SOD reductions also correlated with positive subscore reductions. Females showed these associations more\n strongly than males.\n \n \n \n Conclusion\u00a0\u00a0Our results suggest that the dysregulation in the cytokine system and oxidative stress in patients with schizophrenia is implicated\n in clinical symptoms and is improved at least partially with antipsychotic treatment. The stronger associations in females\n deserve further study and confirmation.",

        "abstract": "Impulsivity refers to a wide spectrum of actions characterized by quick and nonplanned reactions to external and internal stimuli, without taking into account the possible negative consequences for the individual or others, and decision-making is one of the biologically dissociated impulsive behaviors. Changes in impulsivity may be associated with norepinephrine. Various populations of drug addicts all performed impulsive decision making, which is a key risk factor in drug dependence and relapse. The present study investigated the effects of clonidine, which decreased norepinephrine release through presynaptic alpha-2 receptor activation, on the impaired decision-making performance in abstinent heroin addicts.Decision-making performance was assessed using the original version of Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Both heroin addicts and normal controls were randomly assigned to three groups receiving clonidine, 0, 75 \u00b5g or 150 \u00b5g orally under double blind conditions. Psychiatric symptoms, including anxiety, depression and impulsivity, were rated on standardized scales. Heroin addicts reported higher scores on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale and exhibited impaired decision-making on the IGT. A single high-dose of clonidine improved the decision-making performance in heroin addicts.Our results suggest clonidine may have a potential therapeutic role in heroin addicts by improving the impaired impulsive decision-making. The current findings have important implications for behavioral and pharmacological interventions targeting decision-making in heroin addiction.",

        "abstract": "Excessive free radical production leading to oxidative stress may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Oxidative stress increases serum thioredoxin (TRX), a redox-regulating protein with antioxidant activity recognized as an oxidative-stress marker. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical significance of serum TRX levels in various stages of schizophrenia. Serum TRX levels were determined using ELISA from 60 never-medicated first-episode and 66 medicated chronic schizophrenia patients and 66 healthy control subjects matched for age and gender. The psychopathology of schizophrenia was assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Our results showed that group comparison between first-episode and chronic patients and control groups revealed significantly increased serum TRX only in first-episode patients. Increased levels of TRX in patients experiencing an acute stage schizophrenic episode was also significantly higher compared to chronic schizophrenic patients on antipsychotic medication. Serum TRX was also positively correlated with positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Our results suggest oxidative stress occurs in an acute stage of schizophrenic episode and may have an important role in pathogenesis and symptomology of schizophrenia. Lower TRX levels in chronic patients treated with antipsychotics may have implications for treatment outcome.",

Three very recent reports showed the evidence that the IL3 gene, colony stimulating factor 2 receptor alpha (CSF2RA), beta (CSF2RB) and IL-3 receptor alpha (IL3RA), the IL-specific receptor subunits for CSF2 and IL3, respectively, are associated with schizophrenia. To examine the association of the IL3RA polymorphism (rs6603272) with schizophrenia in a Chinese population, 310 physically healthy patients with schizophrenia were compared with 330 age-, sex- matched normal controls. Statistically significant differences were observed in both allelic and genotypic frequencies of the rs6603272 polymorphism (Allele, chi2=6.24, d.f.=1, p=0.013, odds ratio (OR)=1.35, 95% CI 1.07-1.71; Genotype, chi2=6.85, d.f.=2, p=0.033). Our results indicate a small but significant contribution of the IL3RA polymorphism to susceptibility to schizophrenia, suggesting that the IL3 pathway may be involved in schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that centrally released brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) modulates eating behavior and metabolism that is responsible for body weight fluctuation. BDNF also may play an important role in the therapeutic action of antipsychotic medications. We investigated whether the Val66Met polymorphism of the BDNF gene affected weight gain after long-term antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia. The polymorphism was genotyped in 196 Chinese patients with schizophrenia on long-term antipsychotic medication. Serum BDNF was measured in all patients and 50 normal controls. Mean body mass index (BMI) change was evaluated retrospectively by means of clinical records. The results showed that there was a significant relationship between the three BDNF Val/Met genotypes and mean BMI gain, with genotype having a strong effect on BMI gain in male but not female patients. BDNF levels were significantly lower in patients than normal controls, and negatively correlated with BMI gain in female but not male patients. Our results suggest that variation in the BDNF gene may be a risk factor for weight gain in male patients with schizophrenia on long-term antipsychotic treatment, and decreased BDNF levels may be associated with weight gain in females.",

Here, we studied the role of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in incubation of cocaine craving because, like BDNF, GDNF provides trophic support to midbrain dopamine neurons.We first trained rats to self-administer intravenous cocaine for 10 days (6 hours/d, cocaine injections were paired with a tone-light cue). We then manipulated VTA GDNF function and assessed cue-induced cocaine seeking in extinction tests after withdrawal from cocaine.VTA injections of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector containing rat GDNF cDNA (5 x 10(8) viral genomes) on withdrawal Day 1 increased cue-induced cocaine seeking on withdrawal days 11 and 31; this effect was not observed after VTA injections of an AAV viral vector containing red fluorescent protein (RFP). Additionally, VTA, but not substantial nigra (SN), GDNF injections (1.25 microg or 12.5 microg/side) immediately after the last cocaine self-administration session increased cue-induced drug seeking on withdrawal days 3 and 10; this effect was reversed by VTA injections of U0126, which inhibits the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). Finally, interfering with VTA GDNF function by chronic delivery of anti-GDNF monoclonal neutralizing antibodies via minipumps (600 ng/side/d) during withdrawal Days 1-14 prevented the time-dependent increases in cue-induced cocaine seeking on withdrawal days 11 and 31.Our results indicate that during the first weeks of withdrawal from cocaine self-administration, GDNF-dependent neuroadaptations in midbrain VTA neurons play an important role in the development of incubation of cocaine craving.",

A context that is repeatedly paired with reinforcing drugs will acquire secondary reinforcing properties (conditioned reward). However, the effects of conditioned reward on spatial learning are unknown.Using the conditioned place preference procedure and Morris water maze task, we examined the role of conditioned reward or aversion in spatial learning.Groups of rats acquired morphine (10 mg/kg), cocaine (10 mg/kg), or oral sucrose (15%) conditioned place preference (CPP). Another group of morphine-dependent rats acquired conditioned place aversion (CPA) to a context paired with precipitated opiate withdrawal induced by naloxone injections (1 mg/kg). To examine the role of conditioned reward or aversion in spatial learning, rats were then exposed to the previously morphine-, cocaine-, sucrose- or naloxone-paired context for 10 min before training of spatial learning in the Morris water maze.Exposure to the morphine- or cocaine-paired but not the sucrose- or the naloxone-paired context decreased the latency to find the platform in the Morris water maze test.Our results provide the first evidence that conditioned drug reward promotes spatial learning. We speculate that this enhancement of spatial learning by the drug-paired context may promote contextual-cue-induced relapse to drug taking by facilitating exploratory drug-seeking behaviors.",

In this review, we first summarize data from recent (2003\u20132005) studies on the neural substrates involved in reinstatement of heroin and cocaine seeking.

Extinction procedures in the clinic can suppress conditioned responses to drug cues, but the extinguished responses typically reemerge after exposure to the drug itself (reinstatement), the drug-associated environment (renewal), or the passage of time (spontaneous recovery). We describe a memory retrieval-extinction procedure that decreases conditioned drug effects and drug seeking in rat models of relapse, and drug craving in abstinent heroin addicts. In rats, daily retrieval of drug-associated memories 10 minutes or 1 hour but not 6 hours before extinction sessions attenuated drug-induced reinstatement, spontaneous recovery, and renewal of conditioned drug effects and drug seeking. In heroin addicts, retrieval of drug-associated memories 10 minutes before extinction sessions attenuated cue-induced heroin craving 1, 30, and 180 days later.

        "abstract": "During abstinence, memories of drug-associated cues persist for many months, and exposure to these cues often provokes relapse to drug use. The mechanisms underlying the maintenance of these memories are unknown. A constitutively active atypical protein kinase C (PKC) isozyme, protein kinase M \u03b6 (PKM\u03b6), is required for maintenance of spatial memory, conditioned taste aversion, and other memory forms. We used conditioned place preference (CPP) and conditioned place aversion (CPA) procedures to study the role of nucleus accumbens PKM\u03b6 in the maintenance of drug reward and aversion memories in rats. Morphine CPP training (10 mg/kg, 4 pairings) increased PKM\u03b6 levels in accumbens core but not shell. Injections of the PKM\u03b6 inhibitor \u03b6 inhibitory peptide (ZIP) into accumbens core but not shell after CPP training blocked morphine CPP expression for up to 14 d after injections. This effect was mimicked by the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine, which inhibits PKM\u03b6, but not by the conventional and novel PKC inhibitor staurosporine, which does not effectively inhibit PKM\u03b6. ZIP injections into accumbens core after training also blocked the expression of cocaine (10 mg/kg) and high-fat food CPP but had no effect on CPA induced by naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal. Accumbens core injections of Tat-GluR2(3Y), which inhibits GluR2-dependent AMPA receptor endocytosis, prevented the impairment in morphine CPP induced by local ZIP injections, indicating that the persistent effect of PKM\u03b6 is on GluR2-containing AMPA receptors. Results indicate that PKM\u03b6 activity in accumbens core is a critical cellular substrate for the maintenance of memories of relapse-provoking reward cues during prolonged abstinence periods.",

However, no previous studies have reported brain areas that play a role as modulators and underlie the mechanism of diurnal variations in cocaine reward. We examined (1) the diurnal rhythm of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) activity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and reward-related brain areas in naive rats; (2) the effect of day and night on the acquisition of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP); (3) the influence of cocaine-induced CPP on GSK-3\u03b2 activity in the SCN and reward-related brain areas; and (4) the effect of the GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor SB216763 microinjected bilaterally into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) on cocaine-induced CPP. A significant diurnal rhythm of GSK-3\u03b2 activity was found in the SCN and reward-related brain areas, with diurnal variations in cocaine-induced CPP. GSK-3\u03b2 activity in the SCN and reward-related brain areas exhibited marked diurnal variations in rats treated with saline. GSK-3\u03b2 activity in rats treated with cocaine exhibited distinct diurnal variations only in the prefrontal cortex and VTA. Cocaine decreased the expression of phosphorylated GSK-3\u03b2 (i.e. increased GSK-3\u03b2 activity) only in the VTA in rats trained and tested at ZT4 and ZT16. SB216763 microinjected into the VTA bilaterally eliminated the diurnal variations in cocaine-induced CPP, but did not affect the acquisition of cocaine-induced CPP. These findings suggest that the VTA may be a critical area involved in the diurnal variations in cocaine-induced CPP, and GSK-3\u03b2 may be a regulator of diurnal variations in cocaine-induced CPP.",

These neurotrophic factors also play important roles in the survival and function of adult neurons, learning and memory, and synaptic plasticity. Since the mid-1990s, investigators have studied the role of BDNF and GDNF in the behavioral effects of abused drugs and in the neuroadaptations induced by repeated exposure to drugs in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system. Here, we review rodent studies on the role of BDNF and GDNF in drug reward, as assessed in the drug self-administration and the conditioned place preference procedures, and in drug relapse, as assessed in extinction and reinstatement procedures. Our main conclusion is that whether BDNF or GDNF would facilitate or inhibit drug-taking behaviors depends on the drug type, the brain site, the addiction phase (initiation, maintenance, or abstinence/relapse), and the time interval between site-specific BDNF or GDNF injections and the reward- and relapse-related behavioral assessments.",

        "title": "Role of ERK in cocaine addiction.",
        "abstract": "Cocaine addiction is characterized by compulsive drug-taking behavior and high rates of relapse. According to recent theories, this addiction is due to drug-induced adaptations in the cellular mechanisms that underlie normal learning and memory. Such mechanisms involve signaling by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). As we review here, evidence from rodent studies also implicates ERK in cocaine psychomotor sensitization, cocaine reward, consolidation and reconsolidation of memories for cocaine cues, and time-dependent increases in cocaine seeking after withdrawal (incubation of cocaine craving). The role of ERK in these behaviors involves long-term stable alterations in synaptic plasticity that result from repeated cocaine exposure, and also rapidly induced alterations in synaptic transmission events that acutely control cocaine-seeking behaviors. Pharmacological manipulations that decrease the extent to which cocaine and cocaine cues induce ERK activity might therefore be considered as potential treatments for cocaine addiction.",

        "abstract": "When a stabilized memory is recalled or reactivated, it becomes labile and sensitive to disruptors such as protein-synthesis inhibitors. Previous evidence demonstrates that stress modulates different aspects of memory. The role of stress during reactivation on rewarding or aversive memory is not known, however. This study examines the effects of stress on rewarding or aversive memory using the conditioned place preference or conditioned place aversion paradigm. Rats were trained to acquire a sucrose and cocaine-conditioned place preference or naloxone-conditioned place aversion. Subsequently, rats were reexposed to the previous sucrose-paired, cocaine-paired and naloxone-paired chamber for 10 min before experiencing the stressful Morris water maze. All rats were tested for conditioned place preference or conditioned place aversion after the stressful water-maze task. After 5-day repeated exposure to the previously reward-paired chamber and experiencing stress, cocaine-conditioned place preference disappeared and sucrose-conditioned place preference was reversed; however, after 5-day repeated exposure to the previously naloxone-paired chamber and experiencing stress, naloxone-conditioned place aversion was not significantly changed. Our results provide the first evidence that the rewarding memory may have been reduced by exposing rats to stress during reexposure to the reward-paired context, which suggests that manipulations of drug memory during reactivation can provide a potential treatment for drug addiction.",

        "title": "A novel UCS memory retrieval-extinction procedure to inhibit relapse to drug seeking",
        "abstract": "We recently reported that a conditioned stimulus (CS) memory retrieval-extinction procedure decreases reinstatement of cocaine and heroin seeking in rats and heroin craving in humans. Here we show that non-contingent cocaine or methylphenidate injections (UCS retrieval) 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions decreases cocaine-priming-induced reinstatement, spontaneous recovery, and renewal of cocaine seeking in rats. Unlike the CS-based memory retrieval-extinction procedure, the UCS memory retrieval manipulation decreases renewal and reinstatement of cocaine seeking in the presence of cocaine cues that were not present during extinction training and also decreases cocaine seeking when the procedure commences after 28 days of abstinence. The inhibitory effect of the UCS retrieval manipulation on cocaine-priming-induced reinstatement is mediated by regulation of AMPA-receptor endocytosis in the basolateral amygdala. The UCS memory retrieval-extinction procedure has superior relapse prevention characteristics than the CS memory retrieval-extinction procedure and could be a promising method for decreasing relapse in human addicts. Studies using human addicts or animal models of drug addiction indicate that conditioning factors contribute to drug addiction and that responses to drug-associated cues persist during prolonged abstinence1, 2, 3, 4. These findings have led to the development of cue-exposure therapies to extinguish conditioned responses to drug cues5. However, cue-exposure therapy in the clinic often fails to prevent relapse when drug addicts return to their home environment6. The failure of the cue exposure therapy is likely because of the fact that extinguished responses to conditioned cues can be recovered by acute exposure to the unconditioned stimulus (CS, reinstatement), exposure to the original reward-associated context after extinction of the conditioned responses in a different context (renewal), or passage of time after extinction training (spontaneous recovery)7, 8. In recent years, investigators have used a CS memory retrieval-extinction procedure to prevent recovery of fear after extinction in rats9, 10 and humans11, 12. In these studies, reinstatement, renewal, and spontaneous recovery of fear responding were decreased by brief exposure to cues previously paired with footshock (a retrieval manipulation) if that exposure was followed 10\u2009min or 1\u2009h later by repeated exposure to the same cues in longer-duration extinction sessions. We recently adapted this memory retrieval-extinction procedure to drug studies in rats (morphine, heroin, and cocaine) and humans (heroin) and found that the procedure decreases reinstatement, spontaneous recovery and renewal (context-induced reinstatement) of drug seeking in rats, and cue-induced drug craving in humans13. Our results in rats were independently replicated and extended to drug-induced reinstatement of morphine-conditioned place preference (CPP)14, 15 and renewal of alcohol seeking16. However, there are limitations of the CS memory retrieval-extinction procedure for \u2018real world\u2019 relapse prevention17. First, the inhibitory effect of the procedure is selective to the reactivated cues and does not generalize to other cues that were not reactivated11, 12. Second, inhibition of fear by this procedure only occurs when the memory retrieval-extinction manipulation is performed immediately after fear-conditioning training10. Third, for both drug self-administration and CPP, the procedure paradoxically accelerates reacquisition of the previously extinguished conditioned response15, 16. On the basis of these limitations and results demonstrating that the inhibitory effects of neuropharmacological manipulations on both fear conditioning18 and drug CPP19, 20 after memory retrieval was induced by the unconditioned stimulus (UCS), we have recently developed a UCS memory retrieval-extinction procedure and demonstrated its effect on inhibition of Pavlovian conditioned fear in both rats and humans21. In the present study, we modified the UCS memory retrieval-extinction procedure to study its effect on reinstatement, spontaneous recovery, and renewal of cocaine seeking in an operant rat model of drug relapse22. We also assessed whether endocytosis of \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), which contributes to retrieval and reconsolidation of conditioned fear10, 23, 24 and methamphetamine25 memories, play a role in the inhibitory effect of the UCS memory retrieval manipulation on relapse to cocaine seeking. We also chose to study AMPA receptor endocytosis in BLA because of evidence implicating AMPA receptor trafficking in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in relapse to cocaine seeking26, 27, and the role of BLA in reconsolidation of memories for cocaine cues and contexts28, 29, 30. In the experiments described below, we first trained all rats to nose poke for intravenous cocaine for 3\u2009h per day for 10\u201314 days. We then compared the effect of the novel UCS memory retrieval-extinction procedure to our recently established CS memory retrieval-extinction procedure13 on reinstatement of cocaine seeking induced by cocaine-priming injections, spontaneous recovery of cocaine seeking after extinction, and renewal (context-induced reinstatement31) of cocaine seeking after extinction of cocaine self-administration in a different context. We also assessed the effect of the UCS memory retrieval-extinction procedure on reacquisition of cocaine self-administration under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule. In the different experiments, we have used four to five experimental groups (hereafter termed Group in the statistical analyses) that were exposed to the following manipulations: saline injections 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions, cocaine (3 and/or 10\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121; hereafter termed UCS retrieval) 1 or 9\u2009h before the extinction sessions and 15-min CS retrieval 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions. During the 3-h extinction sessions, active nose-poke responding led to contingent presentations of a tone-light cue previously paired with cocaine injections during training, but cocaine was not delivered. The CS retrieval manipulation was a short 15-min session during which the experimental conditions were identical to those of the extinction sessions13. The experimental groups used in each experiment are described in the Methods section and the figures. The delayed 9-h group (cocaine injections 9\u2009h before the extinction sessions), a standard control condition in studies on memory consolidation32 and reconsolidation33, 34, 35, served as a control condition for the temporal specificity of the UCS memory retrieval-extinction manipulation. We have not included this temporal control condition for the CS retrieval manipulation because we previously found that this manipulation had no effect on cocaine or heroin seeking when it was presented 6\u2009h before the extinction sessions13. In Experiment 1, we tested the inhibitory effect of the UCS and CS memory retrieval-extinction procedures on cocaine-priming-induced reinstatement (Supplementary Fig. 1). The statistical analysis included the between-subjects factor of Group and the within-subjects factor of Cocaine priming (0, 5, 10 and 15\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121). We found that exposing rats to the UCS and CS retrieval manipulations 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions decreased cocaine-priming-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking (F(12,132)=11.1, P<0.01 for Group \u00d7 Cocaine Priming interaction). No group differences were found for responding on the inactive nose-poke operandum (P values>0.1). In addition, both the UCS and CS memory retrieval-extinction manipulations accelerated extinction responding (F(52,572)=1.8, P<0.01 for Group \u00d7 Extinction Session). In Experiment 2, we tested the inhibitory effect of the UCS and CS memory retrieval-extinction procedures on spontaneous recovery of cocaine seeking (Supplementary Fig. 2). The statistical analysis included the between-subjects factor of Group and the within-subjects factor of Test session (immediate extinction session, delay 28 day extinction session). We found that exposing rats to the UCS and CS retrieval manipulations 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions decreased spontaneous recovery of cocaine seeking (F(3,36)=14.5, P<0.01 for Group \u00d7 Test session interaction). No group differences were found for responding on the inactive nose-poke operandum (P values>0.1). In addition, both the UCS and CS memory retrieval-extinction manipulations accelerated extinction responding (F(39,468)=2.0, P<0.01 for Group \u00d7 Extinction Session). We also assessed whether the inhibitory effect of the UCS and CS retrieval manipulations on relapse to cocaine seeking is associated with decreased neuronal activation (c-Fos expression36) in medial prefrontal cortex, NAc, and amygdala. Neuronal activity in these brain areas is involved in relapse to drug seeking37, 38, 39 and conditioned drug effects40. We found that both the UCS and CS retrieval manipulations decreased c-Fos expression in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), BLA, and NAc core and shell induced by the spontaneous recovery test 28 days after the last extinction session (F(3,23)=13.7, 9.2, 5.2 and 7.3, P values<0.01, for the different brain areas, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 3). In contrast, no group differences in c-Fos expression were found in the central amygdala (CeA), prelimbic (PrL) and infralimbic (IL) medial prefrontal cortex (P values>0.1; Supplementary Fig. 4). In Experiment 3, we tested the inhibitory effect of the UCS and CS memory retrieval-extinction procedures on renewal (context-induced reinstatement) of cocaine seeking (Supplementary Fig. 5). The statistical analysis included the between-subjects factor of Group and the within-subjects factor of Context (last extinction session in context B, test session in context A). We found that exposing rats to the UCS and CS retrieval manipulations 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions decreased renewal of cocaine seeking (F(3,35)=4.2, P<0.05 for Group \u00d7 Context interaction). No group differences were found for responding on the inactive nose-poke operandum (P values>0.1). Additionally, both the UCS and CS memory retrieval-extinction manipulations accelerated extinction responding (F(36,420)=1.9, P<0.01 for Group \u00d7 Extinction Session). We also found that both the UCS and CS retrieval manipulations decreased c-Fos expression in the ACC, BLA, and NAc core and shell induced by the renewal test 24\u2009h after the last extinction session (F(3,23)=9.0, 11.2, 4.6 and 8.2, P values<0.01, for the different brain areas, respectively, Supplementary Fig. 6). In contrast, no group differences in c-Fos expression were found in CeA, PrL and IL (P values>0.1, Supplementary Fig. 7). As mentioned in the Introduction, the CS memory retrieval-extinction procedure paradoxically accelerates reacquisition of the previously extinguished conditioned response for both alcohol self-administration and morphine CPP15, 16. Therefore, in Experiment 4 we tested the effect of the UCS and CS memory retrieval-extinction procedures on reacquisition of cocaine seeking under a PR reinforcement schedule (Supplementary Fig. 8). We chose to assess reacquisition using a PR reinforcement schedule instead of the fixed ratio 1 (FR1) reinforcement schedule we used during self-administration training because the PR reinforcement schedule is thought to provide a more direct measure of the rewarding effects of a drug than continuous reinforcement schedules41. The statistical analysis included the between-subjects factor of Group and the within-subjects factor of Day (the three reacquisition days). We found that exposing rats to the UCS retrieval manipulation (and, to a lesser degree, the CS retrieval manipulation) 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions decreased reacquisition of cocaine self-administration. The statistical analyses showed a main effect of Group for latency to first respond in the first reacquisition session (F(3,34)=4.9, P<0.05), final ratio on the PR schedule F(3,31)=15.9, P<0.01) and total active nose pokes F(3,31)=11.3, P<0.01), but not inactive nose pokes (P>0.05). Finally, unlike the results of the previous experiments, the UCS and CS memory retrieval-extinction manipulations did not accelerate extinction responding (P>0.1 for Group \u00d7 Extinction Session). In Experiment 5 we assessed whether the inhibitory effect of the UCS and CS memory retrieval-extinction procedures on renewal (context-induced reinstatement) and cocaine-priming-induced reinstatement is also observed when, during the relapse tests, extinguished operant nose-poke responding leads to contingent delivery of a discrete CS cue that had not been previously extinguished during the extinction phase (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1a, we first trained the rats to self-administer cocaine in contexts A\u2032 and B\u2032 where nose pokes for cocaine were paired with CS1 (continuous tone-light cue) or CS2 (intermittent tone-light cue), respectively. Next, we exposed different groups of rats to the UCS and CS retrieval manipulations (both CS1 and CS2 were retrieved in the CS retrieval manipulation) in context B\u2032 before extinction sessions during which nose pokes led to contingent delivery of CS2. Next, we tested the rats in consecutive sessions for renewal in context A\u2032, saline priming in context B\u2032 (baseline vehicle condition) and cocaine priming in contexts A\u2032 and B\u2032 (Fig. 1a). The main finding in Experiment 5 was that the inhibitory effect of the UCS memory retrieval-extinction manipulation on renewal and cocaine-priming-induced reinstatement was observed for both the extinguished CS (CS2) and the non-extinguished CS (CS1). In contrast, the inhibitory effect of the CS memory retrieval-extinction manipulation was selective to cocaine priming in the presence of the extinguished CS2 in context B\u2032; the CS memory retrieval-extinction manipulation had no effect on either renewal or cocaine-priming-induced reinstatement in context A\u2032 in which nose-poke responding led to contingent delivery of the non-extinguished CS1 during testing (Fig. 1c). The statistical analysis of nose-poke responding during the renewal test showed a significant effect of Group (F(3,27)=15.8, P<0.01). The analysis of nose-poke responding during the cocaine-priming test in context B\u2032 showed a significant Group \u00d7 Cocaine priming (saline, 10\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121) interaction (F(3,27)=21.5, P<0.01). The statistical analysis of nose-poke responding during the cocaine-priming test in Context A\u2032 showed a significant effect of Group (F(3,27)=24.6, P<0.01). No group differences were found for responding on the inactive nose-poke operandum in the different tests (P values>0.1). In addition, both the UCS and CS memory retrieval-extinction manipulations accelerated extinction responding (F(33,297)=3.5, P<0.01, Fig. 1b). Fear-conditioning studies indicate that the inhibitory effect of the CS memory retrieval-extinction procedure on fear inhibition is time-dependent: the procedure is effective when performed immediately after fear-conditioning training but not when it is performed after a delay period between training and the CS retrieval-extinction exposure10. On the basis of this finding, in Experiments 6\u20138 we assessed the effect of the UCS and CS memory retrieval-extinction procedures on reinstatement (cocaine priming), spontaneous recovery, and renewal of cocaine seeking after imposing a 28-day withdrawal (abstinence) period between cocaine self-administration training and the start of the retrieval-extinction procedures. The main finding was that after this withdrawal period, the UCS memory retrieval-extinction manipulation maintained its ability to decrease reinstatement (cocaine priming), spontaneous recovery, and renewal of cocaine seeking, while the CS memory retrieval-extinction manipulation did not (Figs 2, 3, 4). In Experiment 6 (Fig. 2), we found that exposing rats to the UCS but not the CS retrieval-extinction manipulation 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions decreased cocaine-priming-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking (F(3,30)=8.9, P<0.01 for Group \u00d7 Cocaine priming [0, 10\u2009mg/kg] interaction). No group differences were found for responding on the inactive nose-poke operandum (P values>0.1). In addition, the UCS but not the CS memory retrieval-extinction manipulations accelerated extinction responding (F(39,390)=1.5, P<0.05 for Group \u00d7 Extinction session). In Experiment 7 (Fig. 3), we found that exposing rats to the UCS but not to the CS retrieval-extinction manipulations 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions decreased spontaneous recovery of cocaine seeking (F(3,40)=13.9, P<0.01 for Group \u00d7 Test session (immediate extinction session, delay 28-day extinction session) interaction). No group differences were found for responding on the inactive nose-poke operandum (P values>0.1). In addition, the UCS but not the CS memory retrieval-extinction manipulations accelerated extinction responding (F(39,532)=4.0, P<0.01 for Group \u00d7 Extinction session). In Experiment 8 (Fig. 4), we found that exposing rats to the UCS but not the CS retrieval-extinction manipulations 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions decreased renewal of cocaine seeking (F(3,41)=8.0, P<0.01 for Group \u00d7 Context (last extinction session in context B, test session in context A) interaction). No group differences were found for responding on the inactive nose-poke operandum (P values>0.1). In addition, the UCS but not the CS memory retrieval-extinction manipulations, accelerated extinction responding (F(33,451)=4.2, P<0.01 for Group \u00d7 Extinction session). In a recent study, Millan et al.16 trained rats to self-administer alcoholic beer and reported that a short CS memory retrieval (10\u2009min of lever presses that led to contingent presentations of the alcohol-associated discrete cues) that was followed 70\u2009min later by 50\u2009min extinction sessions under the same experimental conditions, decreased renewal (context-induced reinstatement) of alcohol seeking. However, these authors also reported that reversing the experimental sequence (50-min extinction followed 70\u2009min later by 10-min CS retrieval) had the same effect on renewal of alcohol seeking. On the basis of these findings, in Experiment 9 we assessed whether reversing the extinction and the UCS retrieval conditions would affect renewal of cocaine seeking. We found that reversal of the experimental conditions had no effect on renewal of cocaine seeking (Supplementary Fig. 9). The statistical analysis of active nose-poke responding included the between-subjects factor of Group and the within-subjects factor of Context (last extinction session in context B, test session in context A). This analysis showed a significant effect of Context (F(1,15)=141.1, P<0.01) but no significant effects of Group or Group \u00d7 Context interaction. No group differences were found for responding on the inactive nose-poke operandum (P values>0.1). In addition, the reversal manipulation had no effect on extinction responding (P values>0.1). In Experiments 10\u201311, we assessed whether endocytosis of AMPA receptors in BLA, which contributes to retrieval and reconsolidation of conditioned fear10, 23, 24 and methamphetamine25 memories, plays a role in the inhibitory effect of the UCS memory retrieval manipulation on relapse to cocaine seeking. As mentioned in the Introduction, we also chose to study AMPA receptor endocytosis in BLA because of evidence implicating AMPA receptor trafficking in the NAc in relapse to cocaine seeking26, 27, and the role of BLA in reconsolidation of memories for cocaine cues and contexts28, 29, 30. In Experiment 10 (Fig. 5a), we assessed the effect of UCS retrieval on the membrane expression of GluA1 and GluA2 in BLA. The statistical analysis included the between-subjects factor of Group. We found that membrane levels of GluA1 (F(2,17)=20.1, P<0.01) and GluA2 (F(2,17)=15.0, P<0.01) were decreased 1\u2009h after UCS (non-contingent cocaine) exposure (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 10). In Experiment 11 we assessed whether blockade of endocytosis of AMPAR in BLA would reverse the effect of the UCS memory retrieval-extinction procedure on cocaine-priming-induced reinstatement. For this purpose, we used the GluA23y peptide, which has been shown in several studies to inhibit GluA2-dependent AMPAR endocytosis42, 43, 44. We found that injections of GluA23y into BLA blocked the inhibitory effect of UCS memory retrieval-extinction manipulation on cocaine-priming-induced reinstatement (Fig. 6a; see Supplementary Fig. 11 for the anatomical placement of the intracranial injectors). The statistical analysis, which included the between-subjects factors of UCS Manipulation (saline, cocaine (3\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121)) and GluA23y Condition (scramble peptide, GluA23y), and the within-subjects factor of Cocaine priming (0, 10\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121), showed a significant interaction between the three factors (F(1,37)=15.0, P<0.01, Fig. 6c). No group differences were found for responding on the inactive nose-poke operandum (P values>0.1). In addition, BLA injections of GluA23y blocked the accelerating effect of UCS memory retrieval-extinction manipulation on extinction responding (F(13,481)=3.3, P<0.01 for UCS Manipulation \u00d7 GluA23y Condition \u00d7 Extinction Session interaction, Fig. 6b). Our data indicate that the UCS retrieval procedure using cocaine as the UCS inhibits relapse to cocaine seeking under a wide range of experimental conditions. However, from a treatment perspective, it is highly likely that both clinicians and regulatory agencies would be reluctant to expose cocaine addicts to their abused drug in the clinic. Therefore, in Experiments 12\u201313 we used four groups of rats to determine the generality of the UCS retrieval manipulation to methylphenidate, an FDA-approved medication. Methylphenidate is a central nervous system stimulant that has been widely used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder45. Similar to cocaine, methylphenidate blocks the dopamine transporter, leading to increased concentrations of dopamine in the striatum46. Thus, we assessed the effect of exposure to methylphenidate (3\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121, intraperitoneal (i.p.)) 1\u2009h before each extinction session on reinstatement (cocaine priming) and spontaneous recovery. The main finding was that, similar to cocaine, exposure to methylphenidate accelerated extinction responding, and decreased reinstatement (cocaine priming) and spontaneous recovery (Figs 7, 8). In Experiment 12 (Fig. 7), the statistical analysis, which included the between-subjects factor of Group and the within-subjects factor of Cocaine priming (0, 5, 10 and 15\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121), showed main effects of Cocaine Priming (F(3,48)=11.4, P<0.01) and Group (F(1,16)=24.0, P<0.01). No group differences were found for responding on the inactive nose-poke operandum (P values>0.1). In addition, methylphenidate injections accelerated extinction responding (F(13,208)=2.3, P<0.01 for Group \u00d7 Extinction Session). In Experiment 13 (Fig. 8), the statistical analysis, which included the between-subjects factor of Group and the within-subjects factor of Test condition (immediate extinction session, delay 28-day extinction session), showed an interaction between the two factors (F(1,16)=7.8, P<0.05). No group differences were found for responding on the inactive nose-poke operandum (P values>0.1). In addition, methylphenidate injections accelerated extinction responding (F(13,208)=24.3, P<0.01 for the effect of Extinction Session; F(1,16)=4.9, P<0.05 for group effect). We developed a UCS memory retrieval-extinction procedure and compared its effects on relapse with the CS memory retrieval-extinction procedure13. When the memory retrieval-extinction manipulations started 1 day after cocaine self-administration, both procedures decreased reinstatement (cocaine priming), spontaneous recovery, and renewal (context-induced reinstatement) of cocaine seeking. The UCS retrieval manipulation and, to a lesser degree, the CS retrieval manipulation also decreased the reacquisition of cocaine self-administration. However, when we imposed a 28-day withdrawal period before starting the UCS or CS memory retrieval-extinction procedures, the UCS retrieval manipulation effectively decreased reinstatement, spontaneous recovery and renewal, while the CS retrieval manipulation did not. In addition, the UCS but not CS retrieval manipulation decreased reinstatement and renewal of cocaine seeking in the presence of discrete drug-associated cues that were not previously extinguished during extinction training. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of the UCS memory retrieval manipulation on relapse to cocaine seeking was also observed with methylphenidate, an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We also found that prior exposure to both the CS and UCS memory retrieval procedures decreased neuronal activation in ACC, BLA and NAc core and shell during the spontaneous recovery and renewal tests. More importantly, our data indicate that endocytosis of AMPAR in BLA plays a critical role in the inhibitory effect of UCS memory retrieval-extinction procedure on reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Our rationale for the development of the UCS memory retrieval-extinction procedure was based on several recent findings from fear conditioning and drug addiction studies demonstrating potential limitations of the CS memory retrieval-extinction procedure17, 47. These include selectivity of the inhibitory effect of the CS retrieval manipulation to fear11, 12- or drug (present study)-reactivated cues, which does not generalize to other fear or drug cues that were not reactivated. In addition, inhibition of fear or cocaine seeking only occurs when the CS retrieval-extinction manipulation is performed immediately after fear conditioning10, 48 or cocaine self-administration (present study) training. Furthermore, for both alcohol self-administration and morphine CPP, the procedure accelerates reacquisition15, 16; however, we did not replicate these previous findings for cocaine self-administration in the present study. These different results may be because of the use of different animal models (oral alcohol self-administration and morphine CPP versus intravenous cocaine self-administration) and different procedures (extinction in the training context versus extinction in a novel context and assessment of reacquisition using fixed ratio reinforcement schedule versus PR reinforcement schedule). On the basis of the above limitations of the CS retrieval manipulation, and results demonstrating the inhibitory effects of neuropharmacological manipulations on both fear conditioning18 and morphine or cocaine CPP19, 20 after memory retrieval was induced by the UCS (footshock or drug), we have developed the present UCS memory retrieval-extinction procedure. Our results indicate that the range of conditions under which cocaine seeking is inhibited by this procedure was larger than those under which the inhibitory effects of the CS memory retrieval-extinction procedure are observed. Specifically, unlike the CS retrieval manipulation, the UCS retrieval manipulation decreased renewal and reinstatement of cocaine seeking in the presence of cues that were not present during extinction training, and also inhibited cocaine seeking when the procedure started after 28 withdrawal days. In addition, the UCS retrieval manipulation was somewhat more effective than the CS retrieval manipulation in decreasing reacquisition of cocaine self-administration (Supplementary Fig. 8). The development of the CS memory retrieval-extinction procedure for both fear conditioning9, 11 and drug relapse13 was on the basis of theoretical accounts of memory retrieval and reconsolidation and studies on the effects of neuropharmacological manipulations (for example, inhibition of protein synthesis) on reconsolidation of appetitive and aversive memories34, 35, 49. Reconsolidation refers to a process wherein memories are maintained after their retrieval and destabilization (destabilization refers to the return of a memory to a labile phase after memory retrieval)47, 49. Investigators have inferred that memory reconsolidation was disrupted when post-retrieval neuropharmacological manipulations within a specific time interval (up to 2\u2009h post retrieval, a \u2018reconsolidation window\u2019) disrupt the expression of the conditioned responses33, 35, 50. Within this framework, and the finding that inhibition of protein synthesis in BLA after UCS (shock) retrieval prevented conditioned fear18, the finding that our UCS retrieval manipulation decreased reinstatement, spontaneous recovery, and renewal when rats were exposed to non-contingent cocaine injections 1\u2009h but not 9\u2009h before the extinction sessions supports a reconsolidation interpretation of our data. Additional support for the reconsolidation interpretation is that reversal of the experimental conditions\u2014extinction sessions before cocaine UCS exposure\u2014had no effect on renewal of cocaine seeking. However, a reconsolidation account of our data should be made with caution. First, in most experiments (see figures), nose-poke responding was significantly lower during the last extinction session than during the reinstatement, spontaneous recovery, and renewal tests. Furthermore, the effect of the UCS retrieval manipulation on extinction responding\u2014a behaviour induced by exposure to drug-associated cues51\u2014was modest and somewhat inconsistent across experiments (see figures). Therefore, as with the CS retrieval manipulation (present results and ref. 13), the UCS retrieval manipulation only weakened cocaine cue memories (or alternatively decreased the motivational effects of the cues) rather than completely preventing the expression of the conditioned response, as would have been predicted by a reconsolidation account of the data. One alternative interpretation is that UCS (cocaine) exposure within the consolidation window of extinction memory has strengthened this memory, rendering the original appetitive memory less susceptible to reinstatement, spontaneous recovery, or renewal. In this regard, pharmacological manipulations that promote consolidation of extinction memory decrease reinstatement, spontaneous recovery, and renewal of conditioned fear52, 53. However, an enhancement of extinction consolidation account of our data is somewhat unlikely because cocaine (UCS) exposure 1\u2009h after extinction training (within a putative extinction consolidation window) had no effect on renewal of cocaine seeking. Another alternative interpretation of the data is that the UCS retrieval manipulation decreased non-reinforced cocaine seeking because repeated non-contingent cocaine exposure before the extinction sessions facilitates discrimination between reinforced and non-reinforced sessions. This notion is based on the account that McNally and colleagues16 provided for the mechanism underlying the CS retrieval manipulation to explain their findings that this procedure inhibited renewal of alcohol seeking, but unexpectedly increased reacquisition of alcohol self-administration. However, it is unlikely that the \u2018improved discrimination\u2019 hypothesis can explain our data because we found that the UCS retrieval manipulation decreased both non-reinforced cocaine seeking during the relapse tests and reacquisition of cocaine self-administration. Mihindou et al.54 reported that the effect of cocaine priming (15\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121) on reinstatement after extinction is decreased over repeated testing in the drug context, an effect that is context-dependent. These results may suggest that the inhibitory effect of the UCS retrieval manipulation is merely due to extinction of the response to cocaine priming. This possibility is unlikely for two reasons. First, cocaine has a short half-life in rats (30\u2009min)55; thus, it is unlikely that extinction training performed 1\u2009h after injections of a low cocaine dose (3\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121, i.p) was in the presence of pharmacologically relevant doses of cocaine. Second, unlike the finding of Mihindou et al.54 on the context-dependent effect of their cocaine-priming manipulation, the inhibitory effect of the UCS retrieval manipulation for cocaine priming was context-independent (Fig. 1). Finally, an important question is the brain mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of the UCS retrieval manipulation on cocaine seeking. Our c-Fos data (Supplementary Figs 3 and 6) suggest a role of ACC, BLA, and NAc; brain areas involved in relapse to drug seeking37, 38 and conditioned drug effects40. However, from a mechanistic perspective these correlational data should be interpreted with caution because it is unknown whether increased c-Fos expression is the cause or the consequence of the rats\u2019 behaviour in the relapse tests. Our data from subsequent experiments, however, demonstrate an important role of AMPAR endocytosis in BLA in the inhibitory effect of the UCS retrieval manipulation on reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Thus, non-contingent cocaine injections (the UCS retrieval manipulation) decreased the expression of GluA1 and GluA2 in the membrane fraction of BLA neurons. More importantly, inhibition of endocytosis of AMPAR by BLA injections of GluA23y (refs 43, 44) blocked the effect of the UCS memory retrieval-extinction procedure on reinstatement of cocaine seeking. This mechanistic account of the UCS memory retrieval procedure extends findings from previous studies on the role of AMPAR endocytosis in BLA in memory retrieval and reconsolidation10, 23, 24. However, we cannot exclude that glutamate receptor transmission and synaptic plasticity in other brain regions such as the NAc26, 56, 57 also plays a role in the inhibitory effect of the UCS retrieval manipulation on cocaine seeking. Finally, in a recent study we reported on the development of a CS memory retrieval-extinction procedure and demonstrated its efficacy in decreasing drug relapse in a rat model and heroin craving in humans13. However, as discussed above and demonstrated in the present report, two main limitations of the CS-based retrieval procedure is that it is not effective after prolonged withdrawal periods and its inhibitory effect on relapse is limited to the reactivated CS. Here we showed that the UCS memory retrieval-extinction procedure can overcome these two main limitations of the CS-based procedure and, importantly, that an FDA-approved drug, methylphenidate, can mimic cocaine\u2019s effects in the \u2018improved\u2019 UCS-based procedure. We propose that using this procedure in the clinic with methylphenidate or other FDA-approved reuptake blockers of the dopamine transporter could be a promising method for decreasing relapse in cocaine addicts. We received male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats, weighing 260\u2013280\u2009g, from the Laboratory Animal Center, Peking University Health Science Center. We housed the rats in groups of five in a temperature- (23\u00b12\u2009\u00b0C) and humidity (50\u00b15%)-controlled animal facility with free access to food and water and kept them on a reverse 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle. We performed the experimental procedures in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the procedures were approved by the Biomedical Ethics Committee for animal use and protection of Peking University. We anaesthetized the rats (weighing 300\u2013320\u2009g when surgery began) with sodium pentobarbital anaesthesia (60\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121, i.p.) and inserted catheters into the right jugular vein with the tip terminating at the opening of the right atrium as previously described13, 58. We allowed the rats to recover for 5\u20137 days after surgery. We implanted 23-gauge guide cannulas (Plastics One) 1\u2009mm above the BLA. The coordinates for the BLA were anterior/posterior \u22122.9\u2009mm, medial/lateral\u00b15.0\u2009mm, dorsal/ventral \u22128.5\u2009mm (refs 59, 60; Supplementary Fig. 11). We anchored the cannulas to the skull with stainless steel screws and dental cement. We inserted a stainless steel blocker into each cannula to maintain patency and prevent infection. The chambers (AniLab Software & Instruments) were equipped with two nose-poke operandi (AniLab Software & Instruments) located 5\u2009cm above the floor of the chambers. Nose pokes in one (active) operandum led to cocaine infusions that were accompanied by a 5-s tone-light cue. Nose pokes in the other (inactive) operandum were also recorded but had no consequence. We trained rats to self-administer cocaine hydrochloride (0.75\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121 per infusion) during three 1-h daily sessions (separated by 5\u2009min) over 10 days. The sessions began at the onset of the dark cycle. We used an FR1 reinforcement schedule with a 40-s timeout period after each infusion. For reacquisition of cocaine self-administration, we used a progressive-ratio reinforcement schedule in which the requirements after each reward delivery were increased in the following way: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 20 and so on, as described previously41. Each session began with the illumination of a house light that remained on for the entire session. We limited the number of cocaine infusions to 20\u2009h\u22121 to prevent overdose. At the end of the training phase, we matched the groups in the different experimental conditions for their cocaine intake during training. We used these training conditions on the basis of our previous study13. UCS retrieval manipulation: We injected the rats non-contingently with saline (0.5\u2009ml, i.p.) or the previously self-administered drug (UC; cocaine (3 or 10\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121, i.p.)) in their home cage at different time points before the start of the 12- to 14-daily 195-min extinction sessions. We based the cocaine UCS retrieval doses on previous studies using the reinstatement procedure51, 61; these studies also guided our choice for the cocaine-priming doses during the reinstatement tests described below. CS retrieval manipulation: This manipulation was identical to the one used in our previous study13. We gave the rats short (15\u2009min) daily sessions during which nose-poke responding led to contingent delivery of the 5-s tone-light cue but not cocaine. We started the 180-min daily extinction sessions 1\u2009h after the CS retrieval manipulation. During the extinction sessions (195\u2009min for the UCS retrieval condition and 180\u2009min for the CS retrieval condition), the conditions were the same as during training, except that active nose-poke response resulted in the delivery of the tone-light cue, but not cocaine infusions. We gave the rats 12\u201314 daily extinction sessions. The test conditions were the same as during training (and the CS retrieval manipulation, except for Experiment 5), with the exception that active nose pokes were not reinforced by cocaine. Each session began with illumination of the house light, which remained on for the entire session. Nose-poke responding during the test sessions resulted in contingent presentations of the tone-light cue that had previously been paired with drug infusions but not cocaine. During the drug-priming reinstatement tests, we injected cocaine 5\u2009min before the start of the sessions. We performed immunohistochemistry for c-Fos in brain tissue sections according to previous studies with minor modifications62, 63. Thirty minutes after the behavioural tests, we perfused six randomly chosen rats per group with 4% paraformaldehyde, removed the brains and post-fixed them for 24\u2009h. We then sectioned the brains (30-\u03bc coronal sections) with a microtome. We collected every third serial section on gelatin-coated microscope slides. We then placed the sections in freshly prepared methanol\u2013H2O2 solution for 10\u2009min to block endogenous peroxidase activity. After incubation with rabbit anti-Fos (sc-52, Lot #J2313, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:200 dilution in PBS, overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C, then 30\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C), the tissue sections were washed three times in PBS, followed by additional 1\u2009h incubation with biotin-conjugated second antibody and three washes with PBS. We then incubated the sections for 10\u2009min in streptavidin peroxidase and washed them three times in PBS. Next, we reacted the sections with a 0.05% solution of 3,30-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Beijing Zhongshan Golden-Bridge Biological Technology) and 0.01% H2O2 in 0.1-M PBS. Incubation times varied from 3 to 10\u2009min, depending on the expression levels of the DAB reaction product determined using microscopy. To exclude the possibility that different developmental procedures across treatment groups would confound the Fos comparisons we incubated sections from a given brain area from the different groups for an equal time. We assessed Fos protein expression in the ACC, PrL, IL, CeA, BLA, and NAc core and shell. The number of Fos-positive cells in these brain regions was counted according to previous studies from our laboratory64, 65, in which two or three sections from each brain region for each rat were selected. The cell numbers on either side of a given brain region were averaged and taken as the positive immunoreactive cell number for each rat. We measured the number of Fos-labelled cells using a cast-grid microscope (MetaMorph/DP10/Bx41, UIC/Olympus, US/JP) with an image-analysis programme (MetaMorph, version 4.65). We injected Tat-GluA23Y (45\u2009pmol per side) and Scrambled Tat-GluA23Y (45\u2009pmol per side) bilaterally into BLA with Hamilton syringes connected to 30-gauge injectors (Plastics One). We based the dose of the peptides on previous reports44, 66. We injected a total volume of 0.5\u2009\u03bcl bilaterally over 1\u2009min and kept the injector in place for an additional 1\u2009min to allow for diffusion. At the end of the experiments, we anaesthetized the rats with sodium pentobarbital (100\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121, i.p.) and transcardially perfused them. We verified cannula placements using Nissl staining with a section thickness of 40\u2009\u03bcm under light microscopy. We excluded three rats with misplaced cannulas from the statistical analysis. We based the assay\u2019s procedures on those used in our previous studies21, 67, 68. After decapitation, we rapidly extracted the rats\u2019 brains, froze them in \u221260\u2009\u00b0C N-hexane and then transferred the brains to \u221280\u2009\u00b0C freezer. We placed bilateral tissue punches (12 gauge) of the BLA in a 1.5-ml microtube that contained ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.32\u2009M sucrose, 4\u2009mM HEPES, 1\u2009mM EDTA, 1\u2009mM EGTA and protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail, pH 7.4). After homogenizing the sample by an electrical disperser (Wiggenhauser, Sdn Bhd), we centrifuge the homogenate at 1,000g for 10\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C to obtain the pellet (P1) that contained nuclei and large debris. We centrifuged again the supernatant (S1) at 10,000g for 30\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C to generate a crude synaptosomal fraction (P2) and supernatant (S2; the cytosolic fraction). We lysed the crude synaptosomal membrane pellet (P2) hypo-osmotically and centrifuged it at 25,000g for 30\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C to generate the synaptosomal membrane fraction (LP1). The S2 and LP1 were separately resuspended in HEPES-lysis buffer (50\u2009mM HEPES, 1\u2009mM EDTA, 1\u2009mM EGTA and protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail, pH 7.4). We determined the protein concentrations of all of the samples (S2 and LP1) using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Beyotime Biotechnology). We further diluted the samples in HEPES-lysis buffer to equalize the protein concentrations. We added 4 \u00d7 loading buffer (16% glycerol, 20%-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS and 0.05% bromophenol blue) was added to each sample (3:1, sample:loading buffer) before boiling for 3\u2009min. We cooled the samples and subjected them to SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% acrylamide/0.27% N,N\u2032-methylenebisacryalamide resolving gel) for ~40\u2009min at 80\u2009V in stacking gel and ~1\u2009h at 130\u2009V in resolving gel. For each electrophoresis run, increasing amounts of protein pooled from the brain region being tested were used to produce a standard curve. We transferred the proteins electrophoretically to Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore) at 0.25A for 2.5\u2009h. We washed the membranes with TBST (Tris-Buffered Saline plus 0.05% Tween-20, pH 7.4) and then placed them in blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin (BSA in TBST) overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. We then incubated the membranes for 1\u2009h at room temperature on an orbital shaker with anti-GluR1 (ab109450, 1:1,000; Abcam), anti-GluR2 (ab52932, 1:1,000; Abcam) or \u03b2-actin (sc-47778, 1:1,000; Santa Cruz) in TBST plus 5% BSA and 0.05% sodium azide. After three 5-min washes in TBST buffer, we incubated the blots for 45\u2009min at room temperature on a shaker with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG; Santa Cruz; PI-1,000; Vector Labs) diluted 1:5,000 in blocking buffer. We then washed the blots three times for 5\u2009min each in TBST and incubated with a layer of Super Signal Enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Detection Reagents 1 and 2, 1:1 ratio, Pierce Biotechnology) for 1\u2009min at room temperature. We removed excess mixture before the wrapping the blots with a clean piece of plastic wrap (no bubbles between blot and wrap) and detected the blots by ChemiDoc MP (Bio-Rad). We quantified band intensities using two observers who were blind to the experimental groups using the Quantity One software (version 4.4.0, Bio-Rad). We compared band intensities from each test sample to the band intensities from the standard curves. The amount of the protein of interest in each sample was interpolated from the standard curve. The standard curve runs in all western blots in our studies demonstrate that the band intensities for each of our test samples were within the linear range of detection. Experiment 1: Effect of UCS and CS retrieval manipulations on cocaine-priming-induced reinstatement: We trained rats to self-administer intravenous cocaine during three 1-h daily sessions over 10 days. After training, we divided the rats into five experimental groups: saline injections 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions, cocaine (3\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121) 1 or 9\u2009h before the extinction sessions, cocaine (10\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121) 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions and 15-min CS retrieval 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions. We subsequently tested all rats for reinstatement of nose-poke responding after priming non-contingent injections of saline (0.5\u2009ml, i.p.) and cocaine (5,10, and 15\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121, i.p.) in counterbalanced order over 4 days. Experiment 2: Effect of UCS and CS retrieval manipulations on spontaneous recovery of cocaine seeking : We trained rats to self-administer intravenous cocaine during three 1-h daily sessions over 10 days. After training, we divided the rats into four experimental groups: saline injections 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions, cocaine (3\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121) 1 or 9\u2009h before the extinction sessions, and 15-min CS retrieval 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions. We subsequently tested all rats for spontaneous recovery 28 days after the last extinction session. Thirty minutes after the spontaneous recovery tests, we deeply anaesthetized the rats, perfused them and extracted their brains for subsequent immunohistochemistry assays of Fos. Experiment 3: Effect of UCS and CS retrieval manipulations on spontaneous recovery of cocaine seeking: We trained rats to self-administer intravenous cocaine during three 1-h daily sessions over 10 days in Context A. After training, we divided the rats into four experimental groups that underwent the UCS and CS retrieval manipulation in Context B: saline injections 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions, cocaine (3\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121) 1 or 9\u2009h before the extinction sessions and 15-min CS retrieval 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions. The experimental procedure is based on previous studies69, 70, and the two counterbalanced contexts differed from each other as follows: context A had smooth stainless steel rod floor and grey walls; context B had granular flat floor and wallpaper with black and white stripes covered walls. Subsequently, we tested all rats for context-induced reinstatement (renewal) of cocaine seeking in Context A. Thirty minutes after the renewal tests we deeply anaesthetized the rats, perfused them and extracted their brains for subsequent immunohistochemistry assays of Fos. Experiment 4: Effect of the UCS and CS retrieval manipulations on reacquisition of cocaine self-administration: We trained rats to self-administer intravenous cocaine during three 1-h daily sessions over 10 days. After training, we divided the rats into four experimental groups: saline injections 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions, cocaine (3\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121) 1 or 9\u2009h before the extinction sessions and 15-min CS retrieval 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions. We subsequently tested all rats for reacquisition of cocaine self-administration for 2\u2009h per day under the PR schedule (see above). We chose to assess reacquisition using this schedule instead of the FR1 reinforcement schedule because PR schedules are thought to provide a more direct measure of the rewarding effects of a drug than continuous reinforcement schedules41. Experiment 5: Effect of UCS and CS retrieval manipulations on cocaine seeking induced by cocaine cues not present during extinction training: We trained rats to self-administer intravenous cocaine during three 1-h daily sessions. On training days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13, we paired cocaine infusions with tone-light cue-1 (continuous 5\u2009s, CS1) in context A\u2032; on training days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 we paired cocaine infusions with tone-light cue-2 (intermittent 5\u2009s: 50\u2009ms \u00d7 100 with 50-ms interval, CS2) in context B\u2032. Thus, the same tone-light cue was given either continuously or intermittently. The contexts were the same as described in Experiment 3. After training, we divided the rats into four experimental groups that underwent the UCS or CS retrieval manipulations in context B\u2032: saline injections 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions, cocaine (3\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121) 1 or 9\u2009h before the extinction sessions and 15-min CS1 retrieval plus 15-min CS2 retrieval 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions. During the extinction sessions, active nose poke led to contingent presentation of CS2. We then performed four consecutive tests: renewal (context-induced reinstatement) test in which nose pokes were reinforced by CS1 in context A\u2032, saline priming in context B\u2032 (a baseline vehicle condition), cocaine priming (10\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121) in context B\u2032 and cocaine priming in context A\u2032. During the tests in context A\u2032 and context B\u2032, nose pokes led to contingent delivery of CS1 and CS2, respectively. Experiment 6: Effect of UCS and CS retrieval manipulations on cocaine-priming-induced reinstatement after 28 withdrawal days: The experimental procedure for Experiment 6 was identical to that of Experiment 1, except that the retrieval-extinction manipulations started 28 days after training. The experiment included four groups: saline injections 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions, cocaine (3\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121) 1 or 9\u2009h before the extinction sessions and 15-min CS retrieval 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions. Experiment 7: Effect of UCS and CS retrieval manipulations on spontaneous recovery after 28 withdrawal days: The experimental procedure and groups for Experiment 7 were identical to that of Experiment 2, except that the retrieval-extinction manipulations started 28 days after training. Experiment 8: Effect of UCS and CS retrieval manipulations on renewal after 28 withdrawal days: The experimental procedure and groups for Experiment 8 were identical to that of Experiment 3, except that the retrieval-extinction manipulations started 28 days after training. Experiment 9: Effect of reversed sequence of the UCS-retrieval and extinction on renewal of cocaine seeking: The experimental procedure for Experiment 9 was identical to that of Experiment 3, except that the UCS retrieval manipulation was given 1\u2009h after the extinction sessions. The experiment included two groups: saline or cocaine injections 1\u2009h after the extinction sessions. Experiment 10: Effect of CS or UCS retrieval on endocytosis of GluA1 and GluA2 in BLA: We trained rats to self-administer intravenous cocaine during three 1-h daily sessions over 10 days. After training, we divided the rats into three experimental groups: saline injections 1\u2009h before the decapitation and cocaine (3\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121) 1 or 9\u2009h before the decapitation. We extracted the BLA of the rats for subsequent western blot assays of GluA1 and GluA2. Experiment 11: Effect of injections of GluA23y into BLA on the UCS memory retrieval-extinction manipulation: We trained rats to self-administer intravenous cocaine during three 1-h daily sessions over 10 days. After training, we divided the rats into four experimental groups: injections of scramble GluA23y into BLA+saline injection (1\u2009ml\u2009kg\u22121, i.p.), injections of scramble GluA23y into BLA followed by cocaine injection (3\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121, i.p.), injections of GluA23y into BLA followed by saline injection (i.p.), and injections of GluA23y into BLA followed by cocaine injection (3\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121, i.p.). All rats received extinction training after the different manipulations 1\u2009h later. We subsequently tested all rats for reinstatement of nose-poke responding after priming non-contingent injections of saline (0.5\u2009ml, i.p.) and cocaine (10\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121, i.p.). Experiment 12: Effect of exposure to methylphenidate 1\u2009h before extinction training on reinstatement of cocaine seeking: We trained rats to self-administer intravenous cocaine during three 1-h daily sessions over 10 days. After training, we divided the rats into two experimental groups: saline injections 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions and methylphenidate (3\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121) injections 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions. We subsequently tested all rats for reinstatement of nose-poke responding after priming non-contingent injections of saline (0.5\u2009ml, i.p.) and cocaine (5, 10 and 15\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121, i.p.) in counterbalanced order over 4 days. Experiment 13: Effect of exposure to methylphenidate 1\u2009h before extinction training on spontaneous recovery of cocaine seeking: We trained rats to self-administer intravenous cocaine during three 1-h daily sessions over 10 days. After training, we divided the rats into two experimental groups: saline injections 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions and methylphenidate (3\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121) injections 1\u2009h before the extinction sessions. We subsequently tested all rats for spontaneous recovery 28 days after the last extinction session. We report the results as mean\u00b1s.e.m. and analysed the data by analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with the appropriate between- and within-subjects factors for each experiment (see Results section). We followed up on significant main effects and interactions (P<0.05, two-tailed) from the factorial ANOVAs using Turkey\u2019s post hoc tests. How to cite this article: Luo, Y.-X. et al.

        "title": "Effect of Selective Inhibition of Reactivated Nicotine-Associated Memories With Propranolol on Nicotine Craving",
        "abstract": "Importance  A relapse into nicotine addiction during abstinence often occurs after the reactivation of nicotine reward memories, either by acute exposure to nicotine (a smoking episode) or by smoking-associated conditioned stimuli (CS). Preclinical studies suggest that drug reward memories can undergo memory reconsolidation after being reactivated, during which they can be weakened or erased by pharmacological or behavioral manipulations. However, translational clinical studies using CS-induced memory retrieval-reconsolidation procedures to decrease drug craving reported inconsistent results.  Objective  To develop and test an unconditioned stimulus (UCS)-induced retrieval-reconsolidation procedure to decrease nicotine craving among people who smoke.  Design, Setting, and Participants  A translational rat study and human study in an academic outpatient medical center among 96 male smokers (aged 18- 45 years) to determine the association of propranolol administration within the time window of memory reconsolidation (after retrieval of the nicotine-associated memories by nicotine UCS exposure) with relapse to nicotine-conditioned place preference (CPP) and operant nicotine seeking in rats, and measures of preference to nicotine-associated CS and nicotine craving among people who smoke.  Intervention  The study rats were injected noncontingently with the UCS (nicotine 0.15 mg/kg, subcutaneous) in their home cage, and the human study participants administered a dose of propranolol (40 mg, per os; Zhongnuo Pharma).  Main Outcomes and Measures  Nicotine CPP and operant nicotine seeking in rats, and preference and craving ratings for newly learned and preexisting real-life nicotine-associated CS among people who smoke.  Results  Sixty-nine male smokers completed the experiment and were included for statistical analysis: 24 in the group that received placebo plus 1 hour plus UCS, 23 who received propranolol plus 1 hour plus UCS, and 22 who received UCS plus 6 hours plus propranolol. In rat relapse models, propranolol injections administered immediately after nicotine UCS-induced memory retrieval inhibited subsequent nicotine CPP and operant nicotine seeking after short (CPP, d = 1.72, 95% CI, 0.63-2.77; operant seeking, d = 1.61, 95% CI, 0.59-2.60) or prolonged abstinence (CPP, d = 1.46, 95% CI, 0.42-2.47; operant seeking: d = 1.69, 95% CI, 0.66-2.69), as well as nicotine priming-induced reinstatement of nicotine CPP ( d = 1.28, 95% CI, 0.27-2.26) and operant nicotine seeking ( d = 1.61, 95% CI, 0.59-2.60) after extinction. Among the smokers, oral propranolol administered prior to nicotine UCS-induced memory retrieval decreased subsequent nicotine preference induced by newly learned nicotine CS (CS1, Cohen d = 0.61, 95% CI, 0.02-1.19 and CS2, d = 0.69, 95% CI, 0.10-1.28, respectively), preexisting nicotine CS ( d = 0.57, 95% CI, \u22120.02 to 1.15), and nicotine priming (CS1, d = 0.82, 95% CI, 0.22-1.41 and CS2, d = 0.78, 95% CI, 0.18-1.37, respectively; preexisting nicotine CS, d = 0.92, 95% CI, 0.31-1.52), as well as nicotine craving induced by the preexisting nicotine CS ( d = 0.64, 95% CI, 0.05-1.22), and nicotine priming ( d = 1.15, 95% CI, 0.52-1.76).  Conclusions and Relevance  In rat-to-human translational study, a novel UCS-induced memory retrieval-reconsolidation interference procedure inhibited nicotine craving induced by exposure to diverse nicotine-associated CS and nicotine itself. This procedure should be studied further in clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "The harm associated with high-risk injected opiate use and the threat of the HIV epidemic among injecting drug users has become a worldwide problem. Twenty years ago, in the face of a rapid increase in mortality rates among injecting drug users and the upcoming threat of HIV, the first harm-reduction programs were implemented in the Western world. This paper is a literature review describing four forms of harm reduction currently in use in Europe, North America, and Australia. Each represents a reasonable counterapproach to the threat of increased prevalence of HIV among injecting drug users in transitional and developing countries. The paper attempts to explain the concepts behind the most commonly used types of harm reduction and provides a brief overview of the advantages and disadvantages of each and the reasons for their implementation. The main focus of the review is on the definition and the practical aspects of harm reduction; it includes a brief introduction of Chinese harm-reduction efforts and their implications.",

The number of registered drug abusers increased from 70,000 in 1990 to more than one million by the end of 2004. In addition to opioids, abuse of 'new' types of drugs including 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and ketamine has spread since 1997. Illicit drug trafficking and production have swept most of southern China, and throughout the country drug abuse has caused many problems for both abusers and the community. One major drug-related problem is the spread of HIV, which has caused major social and economic damage in China. In response, the Chinese government has begun an anti-drug campaign, including legislative measures to control drug abuse. However, changing the public's attitudes toward drug abusers and breaking the link between drug use and HIV spread are equally important.",

        "abstract": "Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) includes Chinese medicine and acupuncture. Chinese medicine consists of natural products including plants, animals and minerals. TCM has been practiced in China for more than 2000 years, and for the past 200 years has been used in treatment of drug addiction. Ten Chinese medicines for the treatment of opiate addiction have been approved by the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA), and at least 6 are in clinical trials. The general therapeutic principle of Chinese medicine developed was based on its unique theory of \" reinforcing healthy Qi and resolving and removing effects of toxicity\". Acupuncture, another essential part of TCM, which was developed based on the principle that \" functions of the human body are controlled by the ' Jing-Luo' and 'Qi-Xue'system\" , has been used not only in China, but also in Europe, the USA and other countries, for controlling opiate addiction. There are some advantages in using TCM for opiate detoxification, including less harmful side effects, high safety and ideal effects in the inhibition of protracted withdrawal symptoms and relapse. Co-administration of TCM with modern medicine shows some synergistic effects in detoxification. Many TCM for detoxification also have efficacy in the rehabilitation of abnormal body functions induced by chronic drug use, including improving immune function, increasing working memory and preventing neurological disorder. Given that TCM is effective in the prevention of relapse and causes fewer side effects, it may be used widely in the treatment of opiate addiction.",

        "title": "Comparison of drug abuse in Germany and China.",
        "abstract": "Drug abuse has a long, but also different history in Germany and China. The Opium War largely influenced the history of China in 19th century; however, China was once recognized as a drug-free nation for 3 decades from the 1950s to the 1980s. Drug abuse has spread quickly since re-emerging as a national problem in China in the late 1980s. The number of registered drug abusers increased from 70 000 in 1990 to more than 1 million by the end of 2005. In past decades, illicit drug trafficking and production have swept most provinces in China, and drug abuse has caused many problems for both abusers and the community. One major drug-related problem is the spread of HIV, which has caused major social and economic damage in China. Germany, the largest developed European country, also faces the drug and addiction problem. Germany has about 150 000 heroin addicts, for whom HIV/AIDS has become a serious threat since the mid 1980s. To control the drug problem, the German Government adopted the pAction Plan on Drugs and Addictionq in 2003; the China Central Government approved a similar regulation in the antidrug campaign in 2005. Germany has experience in reducing drug-related harm. The methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) program has run for more than 20 years and the public has become more tolerant of addicts. In 2003, China began the MMT program for controlling the spread of HIV/AIDS. It is necessary for China to learn from developed countries to acquire success in its antidrug campaign. In this review, we will go over the differences and similarities in drug abuse between Germany and China. The differences are related to history, population and economics, drug policy context, drug laws, HIV/hepatitis C virus infection, the MMT program and so on. These 2 nations have drug abuse problems with different histories and currently use different approaches to handle illicit drug marketing and use. The legal penalties for illicit drug offences reflect the social differences of these 2 nations with respect to the seriousness of particular types of crimes. The characteristics of the MMT program may also influence patterns of drug abuse in these 2 nations and China should improve the MMT program based on the successful model in Europe, the USA, and Australia. We recommend more dialogue and collaboration between Germany and China.",

        "abstract": "Clonidine is an alpha2 adrenoceptor agonist that is frequently used to reduce withdrawal symptoms during opioid detoxification in humans. The long-term effects of clonidine on withdrawal symptoms and its effects on subsequent drug exposure have not been thoroughly documented. The aim of the study was to determine if clonidine administered during morphine withdrawal in rhesus monkeys produces long-lasting effects on withdrawal symptoms and alters the effects of subsequently taken drugs of abuse.Adult male rhesus monkeys were treated with increasing doses of morphine for 90 d to induce opiate (narcotic) dependence. The immediate and long-lasting effects of 1 week's administration of clonidine were measured via the recording of morphine withdrawal signs and the subsequent effects of challenge injections of morphine or cocaine.Monkeys chronically treated with morphine displayed withdrawal signs that lasted 2 weeks after cessation of morphine administration and displayed sensitized responses to subsequent morphine and cocaine injections. Clonidine significantly reduced certain morphine withdrawal signs and overall withdrawal score, but these effects did not persist upon cessation of clonidine treatment. Sensitization to the effects of morphine and cocaine were significantly reduced in monkeys previously treated with clonidine.Our results suggest that in addition to its short-term alleviating effect on morphine withdrawal signs, clonidine may reduce subsequent effects of drugs of abuse after prolonged abstinence.",

Additionally, the Cronbach \u03b1 coefficient was determined to be 0.769, which is satisfactory.

        "abstract": "Exposure to cues previously associated with drug intake leads to relapse by activating previously acquired memories. Based on previous findings, in which cannabinoid CB(1) receptors were found to be critically involved in specific aspects of learning and memory, we investigated the role of CB(1) receptors in nicotine reward memory using a rat conditioned place preference (CPP) model. In Experiment 1, rats were trained for CPP with alternating injections of nicotine (0.5mg/kg, s.c.) and saline to acquire the nicotine-conditioned memory. To examine the effects of rimonabant on the reconsolidation of nicotine reward memory, rats were administered rimonabant (0, 0.3, and 3.0mg/kg, i.p.) immediately after reexposure to the drug-paired context. In Experiment 2, rats were trained for CPP similarly to Experiment 1. To examine the effects of rimonabant on the reinstatement of nicotine reward memory, rimonabant (0, 0.3, and 3.0mg/kg, i.p.) was administered before the test of nicotine-induced CPP reinstatement. In Experiment 3, to evaluate whether rimonabant itself produces a reward memory, rats were trained for CPP with alternating injections of different doses of rimonabant (0, 0.3, and 3.0mg/kg) and saline. Rimonabant at a dose of 3.0mg/kg significantly disrupted the reconsolidation of nicotine memory and significantly blocked the reinstatement of nicotine-induced CPP. However, rimonabant itself did not produce CPP. These findings provide clear evidence that CB(1) receptors play a role in nicotine reward memory, suggesting that CB(1) receptor antagonists may be a potential target for managing nicotine addiction.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that clock genes are expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, other brain regions, and peripheral tissues. Various peripheral oscillators can run independently of the SCN. However, no published studies have reported changes in the expression of clock genes in the rat central nervous system and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after withdrawal from chronic morphine treatment. Rats were administered with morphine twice daily at progressively increasing doses for 7 days; spontaneous withdrawal signs were recorded 14 h after the last morphine administration. Then, brain and blood samples were collected at each of eight time points (every 3 h: ZT 9; ZT 12; ZT 15; ZT 18; ZT 21; ZT 0; ZT 3; ZT 6) to examine expression of rPER1 and rPER2 and rCLOCK. Rats presented obvious morphine withdrawal signs, such as teeth chattering, shaking, exploring, ptosis, and weight loss. In morphine-treated rats, rPER1 and rPER2 expression in the SCN, basolateral amygdala, and nucleus accumbens shell showed robust circadian rhythms that were essentially identical to those in control rats. However, robust circadian rhythm in rPER1 expression in the ventral tegmental area was completely phase-reversed in morphine-treated rats. A blunting of circadian oscillations of rPER1 expression occurred in the central amygdala, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens core, and PBMCs and rPER2 expression occurred in the central amygdala, prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens core, and PBMCs in morphine-treated rats compared with controls. rCLOCK expression in morphine-treated rats showed no rhythmic change, identical to control rats. These findings indicate that withdrawal from chronic morphine treatment resulted in desynchronization from the SCN rhythm, with blunting of rPER1 and rPER2 expression in reward-related neurocircuits and PBMCs.",

        "abstract": "Protracted cocaine withdrawal can extend for months and contribute to cocaine seeking and relapse. However, no previous studies have reported the manifestation of protracted withdrawal from chronic cocaine in rats. Glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) can phosphorylate PER2, CRY2, Rev-erb\u03b1, and BMAL1 in mammals. The circadian rhythmic expression of GSK-3\u03b2 in reward-related brain areas is unclear. We examined rodent behaviors and circadian disturbances of GSK-3\u03b2 expression during 30 days of protracted cocaine withdrawal. The behavioral tests included open field, elevated plus maze, weight gain, and sucrose preference tests performed 3, 10, and 30 days after stopping cocaine. At these three assessment points, we collected brain samples every 4h for 24h to examine the circadian rhythmic expression of GSK-3\u03b2. Decreased locomotor activity, weight loss, decreased sucrose consumption on day 3, and increased time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze on day 10 after cocaine administration were found. Blunted circadian rhythms of phosphorylated GFK-3\u03b2 (pGSK-3\u03b2) persisted for at least 30 days in all examined brain areas, with the exception of 10 days in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). The expression of pGSK-3\u03b2 decreased in the SCN and increased in the NAc and ventral tegmental area persisted for at least 30 days, whereas in the prefrontal cortex decreased during withdrawal for 10 days but then reversed to abnormally high levels with protracted withdrawal. These long-lasting changes disrupted circadian rhythms and produced abnormal levels of phosphorylated GSK-3\u03b2 protein in reward-related brain circuits, which may play a role in protracted cocaine withdrawal and contribute to relapse.",

        "abstract": "Following British importation of opium to China in 1760s, the use and production of the drug in China increased dramatically. This situation was aggravated after the failure of Opium Wars that occurred between the United Kingdom and the Qing Empire in China with the aim of forcing China to import British Opium; this war made China open the door to a free flowing opium trade, with disastrous social and public health consequences. The subsequent rise of the new China created drug-free atmosphere by strict legislation and punishment, in which drug use greatly decreased. However, in the context of governmental reform and the open-door policies of the 1980s, drug abuse has re-emerged as a major public health problem. Today, drug abuse is highly linked to the spread of HIV/AIDS and to drug-related crimes in China. To combat the severe drug problem facing the nation, the Chinese government has adopted the Methadone Maintenance Treatment program, a multi-faceted therapeutic approach that aims to reduce the health and social problem induced by drug epidemics. In addition, traditional Chinese medicine, including herbal therapy and acupuncture, both found to be effective in the prevention of relapse and causes few side effects, making them useful for the treatment of opiate addiction. With continuous application of these therapies and managements that have been proved to be effective in harm reduction in the western countries, we believe that drug abuse and its related problems in China will be brought under control.",

        "abstract": "Drug addiction processes are considered to be mainly controlled by the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system. Cannabinoids, a class of psychoactive drugs of abuse, elicit their rewarding and pharmacological effects through the endocannabinoid system. Previous research has indicated that dopaminergic neurons in the mesocorticolimbic system are also under the control of the endocannabinoid system. Recently, evidence has suggested that the endocannabinoid system may also participate in the modulation of the common reward system. The present study examined whether rimonabant, a cannabinoid CB\u2081 receptor antagonist, disrupts the acquisition and reinstatement of psychostimulant reward memory measured by conditioned place preference (CPP). Mice were trained to acquire methamphetamine or cocaine-induced CPP. A priming injection of methamphetamine (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) or cocaine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) was respectively given to reinstate methamphetamine or cocaine-induced CPP after extinction. Vehicle or rimonabant (1 or 3 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered at different time-points: 30 min before each CPP training session (acquisition) or 30 min before the priming injection (reinstatement). Rimonabant at doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg significantly inhibited the acquisition of methamphetamine- and cocaine-induced CPP. At the high dose (3 mg/kg), rimonabant disrupted the reinstatement of extinguished methamphetamine- or cocaine-induced CPP. These findings indicate that cannabinoid CB\u2081 receptors play a major role in psychostimulant reward memory, and rimonabant may be a potential pharmacotherapy for psychostimulant addiction.",

        "abstract": "Drug addiction, characterized by high rates of relapse, is recognized as a kind of neuroadaptive disorder. Since the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is critical to neuroplasticity in the adult brain, understanding the role this pathway plays is important for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying drug addiction and relapse. Here, we review previous literatures that focus on the effects of exposure to cocaine, amphetamine, Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), nicotine, morphine, and alcohol on ERK signaling in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system; these alterations of ERK signaling have been thought to contribute to the drug's rewarding effects and to the long-term maladaptation induced by drug abuse. We then discuss the possible upstreams of the ERK signaling pathway activated by exposure of drugs of abuse and the environmental cues previously paired with drugs. Finally, we argue that since ERK activation is a key molecular process in reinstatement of conditioned place preference and drug self-administration, the pharmacological manipulation of the ERK pathway is a potential treatment strategy for drug addiction.",

Drug seeking can be inhibited by manipulation of the reconsolidation of drug-related memory. Sleep has been proposed to be involved in various memory processes. However, the role of sleep in drug reward memory is not clear. The present study used conditioned place preference to examine the effects of total sleep deprivation on retrieval and reconsolidation of morphine reward memory in rats. Six-hour total sleep deprivation had no effect on the retrieval of morphine reward memory. However, sleep deprivation from 0-6 h, but not 6-12 h, after re-exposure disrupted the reconsolidation of morphine reward memory. This impairment was not attributable to the formation of an aversive associative memory between the drug-paired context and sleep deprivation. Our findings suggest that sleep plays a critical role in morphine reward memory reconsolidation, and sleep deprivation may be a potential non-pharmacotherapy for the management of relapse associated with drug-related memory.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that cannabinoid CB1 receptors play an important role in specific aspects of learning and memory, yet there has been no systematic study focusing on the involvement of cannabinoid CB1 receptors in methamphetamine-related reward memory.The purpose of this study was to examine whether rimonabant, a cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist, would disrupt the consolidation and reconsolidation of methamphetamine-related reward memory, using conditioned place preference paradigm (CPP).Separate groups of male Kunming mice were trained to acquire methamphetamine CPP. Vehicle or rimonabant (1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg, i.p.) was given at different time points: immediately after each CPP training session (consolidation), 30 min before the reactivation of CPP (retrieval), or immediately after the reactivation of CPP (reconsolidation). Methamphetamine CPP was retested 24 h and 1 and 2 weeks after rimonabant administration.Rimonabant at doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg significantly inhibited the consolidation of methamphetamine CPP. Only high-dose rimonabant (3 mg/kg) disrupted the retrieval and reconsolidation of methamphetamine CPP. Rimonabant had no effect on methamphetamine CPP in the absence of methamphetamine CPP reactivation.Our findings suggest that cannabinoid CB1 receptors play a major role in methamphetamine reward memory, and cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonists may be a potential pharmacotherapy to manage relapse associated with drug-reward-related memory.",

        "abstract": "Multimodal fusion has been regarded as a promising tool to discover covarying patterns of multiple imaging types impaired in brain diseases, such as schizophrenia (SZ). In this article, we aim to investigate the covarying abnormalities underlying SZ in a large Chinese Han population (307 SZs, 298 healthy controls [HCs]). Four types of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, including regional homogeneity (ReHo) from resting-state functional MRI, gray matter volume (GM) from structural MRI, fractional anisotropy (FA) from diffusion MRI, and functional network connectivity (FNC) resulted from group independent component analysis, were jointly analyzed by a data-driven multivariate fusion method. Results suggest that a widely distributed network disruption appears in SZ patients, with synchronous changes in both functional and structural regions, especially the basal ganglia network, salience network (SAN), and the frontoparietal network. Such a multimodal coalteration was also replicated in another independent Chinese sample (40 SZs, 66 HCs). Our results on auditory verbal hallucination (AVH) also provide evidence for the hypothesis that prefrontal hypoactivation and temporal hyperactivation in SZ may lead to failure of executive control and inhibition, which is relevant to AVH. In addition, impaired working memory performance was found associated with GM reduction and FA decrease in SZ in prefrontal and superior temporal area, in both discovery and replication datasets. In summary, by leveraging multiple imaging and clinical information into one framework to observe brain in multiple views, we can integrate multiple inferences about SZ from large-scale population and offer unique perspectives regarding the missing links between the brain function and structure that may not be achieved by separate unimodal analyses.",

        "abstract": "Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are one of the cardinal symptoms of schizophrenia, and are proposed to be associated with altered integrity of the left perisylvian language pathways. There is considerable heterogeneity in the pattern of white matter abnormalities across previous studies. We investigated the white matter integrity of the perisylvian language pathways in schizophrenia patients with AVH based on a relatively large sample dataset from four different sites. 113 schizophrenia patients with AVH, 96 patients without AVH (nAVH), and 269 healthy controls (HC) underwent diffusion-weighted imaging. Between-group comparisons were performed on the fractional anisotropy (FA) values of the anterior, posterior, and long segment fasciculi within the perisylvian language network. Analysis of covariance among the 3 groups revealed the long segment of the left perisylvian language pathways was significantly different in FA value. Post hoc analysis showed that compared with the HC group, the AVH group had significantly higher FA measurements in the left long segment. The nAVH group showed intermediate FA values for this segment compared to the AVH and HC group but did not differ significantly from either group. Furthermore, the prospective meta-analyses also revealed that FA value of the left long segment was significantly higher in the AVH group compared to the HC group. Our findings suggest the hyperconnectivity pattern of the left perisylvian language pathways in the presence of AVH in schizophrenia and support the self-monitoring of inner speech model.",

Survival was longer in patients who underwent PCS than patients who underwent NACT. Within each group, survival was highest in those who had complete cytoreduction to 0-mm residual disease. We believe all patients with advanced HGSC should be assessed by a gynecologic oncologist for the feasibility of surgical resection. Primary cytoreductive surgery should be the favorable treatment modality with the goal of complete resection to 0 mm residual disease. Importantly, if 0 mm residual is not feasible, PCS to a residual of 1 to 9 mm should be attempted given the survival advantage in this group over patients who were treated with NACT.",

In pts with BrM, loss of NCF may affect HRQoL significantly. We evaluated the relationship between NCF and HUS as a measure of HRQoL in S4LC pts. Methods: Self-reported HUS data from EQ5D-3L were obtained cross-sectionally from S4LC pts with (BrM) or without BrM (non-BrM). NCF was measured using the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test \u2013 Revised (HVLT-R), the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) and Trail Making Tests (TMT-A/B). NCF scores were correlated with HUS (Pearson Coefficient, R). Results: BrM (n = 54) and non-BrM (n = 40) patients had similar demographics- overall median age was 61 (range 33-89) years; 59% were female; 45% had EGFR/ALK alterations; BrM pts were treated with whole brain (n = 20), stereotactic radiation (n = 19), both (n = 6), or sole use of systemic agents (n = 6); 3 were observed; 7 had BrM resection.

Correlational analyses, stratified by BM status, were performed between HUS and each of FACT-Br and its subscales: FACT-General (G), physical well-being (PWB), social well-being (SWB), emotional well-being (EWB), functional well-being (FWB), and brain cancer (BrC). Linear regression interaction models assessed whether BM modified the associations between FACT-Br or its subscales and HUS. Results: The 65 BM and 42 non-BM patients had similar demographics: median age (range) was 62 (30-83) years, 61% were female, 55% were Caucasian, an...",

Yet, little is known about cancer patients\u2019 perspectives on blood biomarkers in clinical practice. Methods: A 54-item self-administered questionnaire and four interviewer-administered trade-off scenarios were administered to cancer patients across all sites at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. Results: Of 632 eligible patients, 66% (n = 417) completed the survey; 54% female; median age 61 (range 18-101) years. Patients had a median accuracy score of 18% (range 0-81%) on their knowledge of the role of biomarkers on their own cancer. Disease site was significantly associated with knowledge (P = 0.029); patients with breast, genitourinary, and thoracic cancers performed better than patients of other sites. Females (P = 0.012) and those with higher education (P = 0.019) and income (P = 0.0016) also scored better. Scores were not associated with the stage at diagnosis, time ...",

        "abstract": "5Background: A patient\u2019s functional status is a key outcome variable used to both measure and improve quality of care in cancer survivors. However, comprehensive research tools such as the HAQ-DI and WHODAS instruments pose 35 questions altogether, increasing patient reporting burden. We evaluated whether a BLESS could be developed with high sensitivity of screening questions followed by questions relevant to specific physical function domain, through a branching logic algorithm. Methods: Adult cancer clinic outpatients at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre used tablet technology to complete the HAQ-DI, WHODAS, EQ-5D-3L and PRO-ECOG. BLESS was developed as an algorithm that used PRO-ECOG/EQ-5D-3L to screen for appropriate domains of HAQ-DI/WHODAS to query. Sensitivity/specificity of BLESS screeners to HAQ-DI/WHODAS items were reported. BLESS derived physical function scores were also compared to scores generated by the full version of WHODAS/HAQ-DI.

        "abstract": "Oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) displays variable levels of immune cells within the tumor microenvironment. The quantity and localization of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), specific functional TIL subsets (e.g., CD8+), and biomarker-expressing cells (e.g., PD-L1+) may have prognostic and predictive value. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the robustness and utility of computer-assisted image analysis tools to quantify and localize immunohistochemistry-based biomarkers within the tumor microenvironment on a tissue microarray (TMA). We stained a 91-patient OTSCC TMA with antibodies targeting CD3, CD4, CD8, FOXP3, IDO, and PD-L1. Cell populations were segmented into epithelial (tumor) or stromal compartments according to a mask derived from a pan-cytokeratin stain. Definiens Tissue Studio was used to enumerate marker-positive cells or to quantify the staining intensity. Automated methods were validated against manual tissue segmentation, cell count, and stain intensity quantification. Univariate associations of cell count and stain intensity with smoking status, stage, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were determined. Our results revealed that the accuracy of automated tissue segmentation was dependent on the distance of the tissue section from the cytokeratin mask and the proportion of the tissue containing tumor vs. stroma. Automated and manual cell counts and stain intensities were highly correlated (Pearson coefficient range: 0.46-0.90; p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Within this OTSCC cohort, smokers had significantly stronger PD-L1 stain intensity and higher numbers of CD3+, CD4+ and FOXP3+ TILs. In the subset of patients who had received adjuvant radiotherapy, a higher number of CD8+ TILs was associated with inferior OS and DFS. Taken together, this proof-of-principle study demonstrates the robustness and utility of computer-assisted image analysis for high-throughput assessment of multiple IHC markers on TMAs, with potential implications for studies on prognostic and predictive biomarkers.",

        "abstract": "The role of in ovo zinc (Zn) injection in improving the embryonic development in eggs from Zn-deficient hens, via epigenetic and antioxidant mechanisms, was examined. A completely randomized design involving a 1 (the non-injected control)\u2009+\u20091 (the injected control with sterilized water)\u2009+\u20092 (Zn source)\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (Zn level) factorial arrangement of treatments was used. The two injected Zn sources were inorganic Zn sulfate and organic Zn-lysine chelate with a moderate chelation strength, and the two injected Zn levels were 50 and 100\u00a0\u03bcg Zn/egg. In ovo Zn injection decreased (P\u2009<\u00a00.05) embryonic mortality, and increased (P\u2009<\u00a00.05) hatchability and healthy chick ratio. In ovo Zn injection increased (P\u2009<\u00a00.05) embryonic tibia Zn content, but had no effect (P\u2009>\u00a00.05) on copper (Cu)- and Zn-containing superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) activities and metallothionein IV (MT4) levels or their mRNA expression levels and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the embryonic liver. In ovo Zn injection had no effect (P\u2009>\u00a00.05) on the global level of DNA methylation or DNA methylation and histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) acetylation levels of the MT4 promoter in the embryonic liver. However, the organic Zn had higher (P\u2009<\u00a00.05) levels of DNA methylation and H3K9 acetylation than inorganic Zn. These data demonstrate that in ovo Zn injection improved the embryonic development, and the organic Zn was more effective than inorganic Zn in enhancing DNA methylation and H3K9 acetylation in the liver MT4 promoter, but the precise mechanisms require further investigations.",

Chickens were fed a diet with no added inorganic P (containing 0\u00b706 % non-phytate P (NPP)) or with either 0\u00b721 or 0\u00b744 % NPP for 21 d. Plasma P concentration in the hepatic portal vein, mRNA and protein expression levels of NaPi-IIb, PiT-1 and PiT-2 were determined at 7, 14 and 21 d of age. The results showed that the concentration of P in plasma in the hepatic portal vein increased as dietary NPP increased (P<0\u00b70001). At 14 and 21 d of age, the increase in dietary NPP inhibited (P<0\u00b7003) NaPi-IIb mRNA expression level in the duodenum, as well as PiT-1 mRNA and protein expression levels in the ileum, but promoted NaPi-IIb protein expression level (P<0\u00b7002) and PiT-2 mRNA and protein expression levels (P<0\u00b704) in the duodenum. These results suggest that NaPi-IIb, PiT-1 and PiT-2 might be important P transporters in the small intestine of broilers. Higher intestinal P absorption may be achieved by up-regulating the protein expression levels of NaPi-IIb and PiT-2 and down-regulating the protein expression of PiT-1.",

The two environmental temperatures were normal (21\u00b11\u00b0C, NT) and high (32\u00b11\u00b0C, HT). The three dietary Zn sources were a Zn-unsupplemented basal diet (CON), and the basal diet supplemented with 110 mg Zn/kg as either the inorganic Zn sulphate (iZn) or the organic Zn proteinate with a moderate chelation strength (oZn). HT decreased (P<0\u00b7002) egg weight, laying rate, eggshell strength, thickness and weight, but increased (P\u22640\u00b705) rectal temperature, broken egg rate, misshapen egg rate, feed:egg ratio, Cu Zn superoxide dismutase activities in liver and pancreas, as well as metallothionein (MT) level in pancreas, and HSP70 mRNA levels in liver and pancreas of laying broiler breeders. Broiler breeders fed the oZn diet had higher (P<0\u00b704) Zn content in the liver, as well as MT levels in the liver and pancreas, compared with those fed the CON diet. Under HT, broiler breeders fed the oZn diet had higher (P<0\u00b705) Zn content in the pancreas compared with those fed the iZn and CON diets. The results from this study indicated that HT impaired egg production performance and eggshell quality possibly because of the disturbed redox balance and HSP homoeostasis, whereas the oZn is more available than the iZn for pancreatic Zn of heat-stressed laying broiler breeders.",

An experiment was conducted to investigate the relative bioavailability of Se as USSe relative to SSe for broiler chicks fed a conventional corn-soybean meal diet. A total of 504 one-d-old Arbor Acres commercial male broilers were randomly allotted to 1 of 7 treatments with 6 replicates per treatment in a completely randomized design involving in a 2 (Se sources) \u00d7 3 (added Se levels) factorial arrangement of treatments plus a Se-unsupplemented control diet containing 0.05 mg Se/kg by analysis for 21 d. The 2 Se sources were USSe and SSe, and the 3 added Se levels were 0.15, 0.30, or 0.45 mg Se/kg. The Se concentrations, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities, and mRNA relative abundances in plasma, liver, or pancreas of broilers on day 14 and 21 were determined. The results showed that Se concentrations, GSH-Px activities in plasma, liver, and pancreas, and mRNA relative abundances in the liver and pancreas of broilers on day 14 and 21 increased linearly (P < 0.05) as the added Se-level increased. Furthermore, a difference (P < 0.05) between USSe and SSe was detected for GSH-Px mRNA relative abundance in the pancreas of broilers on day 14. On the basis of the slope ratios from the multiple linear regression of the pancreatic GSH-Px mRNA relative abundance of broilers at 14 d of age on daily dietary analyzed Se intake, the Se bioavailability of USSe relative to SSe (100%) was 158% (P < 0.05). The results from this study indicated that the Se from USSe was more available to broilers than the Se from SSe in enhancing the pancreatic GSH-Px mRNA expression.",

Regardless of intestinal segments, Fe absorption was higher (P < 0.006) for Fe-Pro ES and Fe-Pro M than for FeSO4\u00b77H2O, and for Fe-Pro ES than for Fe-Met W. Glycine but not Met supplementation increased (P < 0.03) the absorption of Fe as FeSO4. Regardless of Fe source, Fe addition inhibited (P < 0.05) the mRNA expressions of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) in the jejunum and ileum, but enhanced (P < 0.05) the mRNA expressions of L-type amino transporter 1 (LAT1) and B0-type amino acid transporter 1(B0AT1) in the jejunum and ileum. No differences (P > 0.05) among different Fe sources were observed in the mRNA expression levels of Fe and amino acid transporters in both the jejunum and ileum. The mRNA expression levels of DMT1, ferroportin 1, B0AT1, or y+L-type amino transporter 1 were higher (P < 0.0001), but those of excitatory amino acid transporter 3, LAT1, or y+L-type amino transporter 2 were lower (P < 0.04) in the jejunum than in the ileum. The supplementation of inorganic or organic Fe had no effect (P > 0.14) on the protein expression levels of DMT1 and FPN1 in the jejunum and ileum. The above results indicate that organic Fe sources with stronger chelation strengths showed higher Fe absorption in the jejunum and ileum of broiler chicks. Glycine was more effective in facilitating Fe absorption than Met as a ligand. The mRNA expressions of Fe and amino acid transporters in the jejunum were different from those in the ileum. The DMT1, LAT1 and B0AT1 might be involved in the Fe absorption in the jejunum or ileum of broilers.",

        "abstract": "The present study was carried out to evaluate the effect of dietary supplemental vitamin D3 (VD3) on P absorption and utilisation as well as its related mechanisms in the small intestine of broilers. A total of 384 1-d-old Arbor Acres male broilers were assigned randomly into four treatments following a completely randomised design with a 2 (dietary non-phytate P (NPP) contents: 0\u00b743 and 0\u00b722 %)\u00d72 (dietary VD3 supplemental levels: 0 and 87\u00b75 \u03bcg/kg) factorial arrangement. The experiment lasted for 22 d. The results showed that P contents in serum from the hepatic portal vein and tibia ash of broilers were higher (P<0\u00b705) for 0\u00b743 % NPP than for 0\u00b722 % NPP. The type IIb Na-dependent phosphate cotransporter (NaP-IIb) protein expressions in the duodenum and ileum were higher (P<0\u00b705) also for 0\u00b743 % NPP than 0\u00b722 % NPP. Supplementation of VD3 enhanced (P<0\u00b705) tibia P retention rate and type III Na-dependent phosphate cotransporter (PiT)-1 protein expression in the duodenum of all broilers. Moreover, VD3 supplementation decreased (P<0\u00b7002) mortality and increased (P<0\u00b702) serum P content from the hepatic portal vein after 4 h of feeding, tibia ash content, tibia ash P content and protein expressions of NaP-IIb and PiT-1 in the jejunum of broilers fed diet with 0\u00b722 % NPP. Thus, dietary supplemental VD3 promoted intestinal P absorption and bone P utilisation, and this effect might be associated with enhanced PiT-1 levels in the duodenum and PiT-1 and NaP-IIb levels in the jejunum respectively when dietary NPP is limiting.",

        "abstract": "The present study was carried out to evaluate dietary Mn requirements of broilers from 22 to 42 d of age using molecular biomarkers. Chickens were fed a conventional basal maize-soyabean meal diet supplemented with Mn as Mn sulphate in graded concentrations of 20 mg Mn/kg from 0 to 140 mg Mn/kg of diet for 21 d (from 22 to 42 d of age). The Mn response curves were fitted for ten parameters including heart Mn-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) mRNA and its protein expression levels and the DNA-binding activities of specificity protein 1 (Sp1) and activating protein-2 (AP-2). Heart MnSOD mRNA and protein expression levels showed significant quadratic responses (P<0\u00b701), and heart MnSOD activity showed a broken-line response (P<0\u00b701), whereas Mn content and DNA-binding activities of Sp1 and AP-2 in the heart displayed linear responses (P<0\u00b701) to dietary Mn concentrations, respectively. The estimates of dietary Mn requirements were 101, 104 and 94 mg/kg for full expressions of MnSOD mRNA level, MnSOD protein level and MnSOD activity in the heart, respectively. Our findings indicate that heart MnSOD mRNA expression level is a more reliable indicator than heart MnSOD protein expression level and its activity for the evaluation of Mn requirement of broilers, and about 100 mg Mn/kg of diet is required for the full expression of heart MnSOD in broilers fed the conventional basal maize-soyabean meal diet from 22 to 42 d of age.",

        "abstract": "The role of maternal dietary zinc supplementation in protecting the embryos from maternal hyperthermia-induced negative effects via epigenetic mechanisms was examined using an avian model (Gallus gallus). Broiler breeder hens were exposed to two maternal temperatures (21\u00b0C and 32\u00b0C) \u00d7 three maternal dietary zinc treatments (zinc-unsupplemented control diet, the control diet + 110 mg zinc/kg inorganic or organic zinc) for 8 weeks. Maternal hyperthermia increased the embryonic mortality and induced oxidative damage evidenced by the elevated mRNA expressions of heat shock protein genes. Maternal dietary zinc deficiency damaged the embryonic development associated with the global DNA hypomethylation and histone 3 lysine 9 hyperacetylation in the embryonic liver. Supplementation of zinc in maternal diets effectively eliminated the embryonic mortality induced by maternal hyperthermia and enhanced antioxidant ability with the increased mRNA and protein expressions of metallothionein IV in the embryonic liver. The increased metallothionein IV mRNA expression was due to the reduced DNA methylation and increased histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation of the metallothionein IV promoter regardless of zinc source. These data demonstrate that maternal dietary zinc addition as an epigenetic modifier could protect the offspring embryonic development against maternal heat stress via enhancing the epigenetic-activated antioxidant ability.",

Experiment 1 was conducted to determine an optimal embryonic age for early  in ovo  injection. A total of 720 fertilized eggs with similar weights were randomly allotted to 4 treatments with 6 replicates per treatment and 30 eggs per replicate in a completely randomized design. The eggs were injected with 0.1 mL sterilized water at 3, 6 and 9 embryonic days of incubation (E3, E6 and E9) or non-injection (the control), respectively. The results from experiment 1 showed that E3 and E6 injections increased ( P  P  P u003e0.05) between E9 injection and the non-injected control were observed in either embryonic mortality or hatchability. The findings suggest that the E9 is the optimal embryonic age for early  in ovo  injection.

        "abstract": "An experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of environmental temperature and dietary Mn on egg production performance, egg quality, and some plasma biochemical traits of broiler breeders. A completely randomized factorial design involved 2 environmental temperatures (a normal temperature, 21 \u00b1 1\u00b0C, and a high temperature, 32 \u00b1 1\u00b0C) \u00d7 3 dietary Mn treatments (a Mn-unsupplemented corn\u2013soybean meal basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with 120 mg of Mn/kg of diet as either MnSO4\u00b7H2O or manganese proteinate). There were 6 treatments with 6 replicates (4 birds per replicate). High temperature decreased egg weight (P u003c 0.0001), laying rate (P u003c 0.0001), egg yield (P u003c 0.0001), feed intake (P u003c 0.0001), egg:feed ratio (P u003c 0.0001), eggshell strength (P u003c 0.05) and thickness (P u003c 0.0001), plasma triiodothyronine level (P u003c 0.05), and alkaline phosphatase activity (P u003c 0.04) whereas it increased rectal temperature (P u003c 0.0001); plasma malondialdehyde level (P u003c 0.02); and activities (P u003c 0.002) of lactic dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatine kinase. Broiler breeders fed the diets supplemented with Mn regardless of source had greater (P u003c 0.05) eggshell strength and lower (P \u2264 0.05) plasma triiodothyronine level and protein carbonyl content than those fed the control diet. The broiler breeders fed the diet supplemented with the organic Mn had greater (P u003c 0.01) eggshell thickness than those fed the control diet. There were interactions (P u003c 0.05) between environmental temperature and dietary Mn in laying rate, egg yield, feed intake, and egg:feed ratio. Under normal temperature, dietary Mn did not affect the above 4 parameters; however, under high temperature, broiler breeders fed the diet supplemented with the organic Mn showed greater (P u003c 0.03) improvements in these 4 parameters than those fed the control diet. The results from this study indicated that high temperature significantly impaired egg production performance and eggshell quality and induced lipid peroxidation and tissue damage whereas dietary supplementation of either organic or inorganic Mn improved eggshell strength and thermotolerance and reduced protein oxidation and that the organic Mn could alleviate the negative effect of high temperature on egg production performance of broiler breeders at the period of 32 to 45 wk of age.",

The hypothesis that Mn supplementation would enhance the expression of MnSOD in cultured primary myocardial cells of chick embryos was tested. Eggs collected from Mn-depleted Arbor Acres laying breeder hens were incubated for 10 days and then myocardial cells were isolated and cultivated for 8 days. The embryonic myocardial cells on day 6 were treated with Mn in the cell culture medium at different time points when the proportion of cells showing spontaneous contraction was over 95% after the 3-day primary culture. A completely randomized design involving a 3 Mn levels (0, 0.5 and 1.0 mmol L \u22121 )\u00d73 incubation time points (12, 24 and 48 h) factorial arrangement of treatments ( n =6) was used in the current experiment. The results showed that MnSOD activity and mRNA expression level were induced by Mn and increased with incubation time, which supported the hypothesis that Mn would enhance the expression of the  MnSOD  gene, and thus might protect myocardial cells from oxidative stress during the chick embryonic development.",

        "abstract": "An experiment was conducted to estimate the optimal dietary zinc (Zn) level of brown-egg laying hens fed a corn\u2013soybean meal diet from 20 to 40 weeks of age. A total of 120 20-week-old Beijing Red commercial laying hens were randomly allotted by bodyweight to one of five treatments with six replicates of four birds each in a completely randomized design, and fed a Zn-unsupplemented corn\u2013soybean meal basal diet containing 27.95 mg Zn/kg by analysis and the basal diets supplemented with 30, 60, 90, or 120 mg Zn/kg as Zn sulfate (reagent grade ZnSO4\u00b77H2O) for a duration of 20 weeks. Laying performance, egg quality, tissue Zn concentrations, and activities of serum alkaline phosphatase (AKP), and liver copper-Zn superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) were measured. Regression analyses were performed to estimate an optimal dietary Zn level whenever a significant quadratic response (P u003c 0.05) was observed. Tibia Zn concentration (P = 0.002) and serum AKP activity (P = 0.010) showed significant quadratic responses to dietary supplemental Zn levels. The estimates of dietary Zn requirements for brown-egg laying hens from 20 to 40 weeks of age were 71.95 and 64.63 mg/kg for tibia Zn concentration and serum AKP activity, respectively. The results from this study indicate that the tibia Zn might be a more suitable and reliable parameter for Zn requirement estimation, and the optimal dietary Zn level would be about 72 mg/kg for brown-egg laying hens fed a corn\u2013soybean meal diet from 20 to 40 weeks of age.",

The prevalence of HIV, HBsAg, syphilis, Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) were 17.0%, 7.7%, 11.3%, 18.2% and 13.2%, respectively. In the three different anatomic sites (urethra, rectum and pharynx), the prevalence of rectal CT was the highest (15.5%), whereas NG was most commonly found in the pharynx (8.1%). Low education level, homosexuality, inconsistent condom use and drug use in the previous six months were significantly associated with HIV infection, whereas the former three factors were also associated with HBV infection.Older people (aged\u2009\u2265\u200940 years) and those who lacked knowledge of STIs, and younger people (aged <30 years) as well as inconsistent condom users were more at risk of syphilis and CT infections, respectively. NG infection was only associated with reported dating venues. Our study revealed a heavy disease burden and multiple risk factors of HIV/STIs among MSM in Kunming. It is necessary to promote regular screening and proactive treatment of HIV/STIs among MSM.",

        "abstract": "Background  human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) epidemic in China historically stemmed from intravenous drug users (IDUs) in Yunnan. Due to a shared transmission route, hepatitis C virus (HCV)/HIV-1 co-infection is common. Here, we investigated HCV genetic characteristics and baseline drug resistance among HIV-infected IDUs in Yunnan.Methods Blood samples of 432 HIV-1/HCV co-infected IDUs were collected from January to June 2014 in six prefectures of Yunnan Province. Partial E1E2 and NS5B genes were sequenced. Phylogenetic, evolutionary and genotypic drug resistance analyses were performed.Results Among the 293 specimens successfully genotyped, seven subtypes were identified, including subtypes 3b (37.9%, 111/293), 3a (21.8%, 64/293), 6n (14.0%, 41/293), 1b (10.6%, 31/293), 1a (8.2%, 24/293), 6a (5.1%, 15/293) and 6u (2.4%, 7/293). The distribution of HCV subtypes was mostly related to geographic location. Subtypes 3b, 3a, and 6n were detected in all six prefectures, however, the other four subtypes were detected only in parts of the six prefectures. Phylogeographic analyses indicated that 6n, 1a and 6u originated in the western prefecture (Dehong) and spread eastward and showed genetic relatedness with those detected in Burmese. However, 6a originated in the southeast prefectures (Honghe and Wenshan) bordering Vietnam and was transmitted westward. These subtypes exhibited different evolutionary rates (between 4.35\u00d710\u22124 and 2.38\u00d710\u22123 substitutions site-1 year-1) and times of most recent common ancestor (tMRCA, between 1790.3 and 1994.6), suggesting that HCV was multiply introduced into Yunnan. Naturally occurring resistance-associated mutations (C316N, A421V, C445F, I482L, V494A, and V499A) to NS5B polymerase inhibitors were detected in direct-acting antivirals (DAAs)-naive IDUs.Conclusion This work reveals the temporal-spatial distribution of HCV subtypes and baseline HCV drug resistance among HIV-infected IDUs in Yunnan. The findings enhance our understanding of the characteristics and evolution of HCV in IDUs and are valuable for developing HCV prevention and management strategies for this population.",

        "abstract": "Radiomics is to provide quantitative descriptors of normal and abnormal tissues during classification and prediction tasks in radiology and oncology. Quantitative Imaging Network members are developing radiomic \"feature\" sets to characterize tumors, in general, the size, shape, texture, intensity, margin, and other aspects of the imaging features of nodules and lesions. Efforts are ongoing for developing an ontology to describe radiomic features for lung nodules, with the main classes consisting of size, local and global shape descriptors, margin, intensity, and texture-based features, which are based on wavelets, Laplacian of Gaussians, Law's features, gray-level co-occurrence matrices, and run-length features. The purpose of this study is to investigate the sensitivity of quantitative descriptors of pulmonary nodules to segmentations and to illustrate comparisons across different feature types and features computed by different implementations of feature extraction algorithms. We calculated the concordance correlation coefficients of the features as a measure of their stability with the underlying segmentation; 68% of the 830 features in this study had a concordance CC of \u22650.75. Pairwise correlation coefficients between pairs of features were used to uncover associations between features, particularly as measured by different participants. A graphical model approach was used to enumerate the number of uncorrelated feature groups at given thresholds of correlation. At a threshold of 0.75 and 0.95, there were 75 and 246 subgroups, respectively, providing a measure for the features' redundancy.",

        "abstract": "We evaluated whether the optimal selection of CT reconstruction settings enables the construction of a radiomics model to predict epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status in primary lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) using standard of care CT images. Fifty-one patients (EGFR:wildtype\u2009=\u200923:28) with LACs of clinical stage I/II/IIIA were included in the analysis. The LACs were segmented in four conditions, two slice thicknesses (Thin: 1\u2009mm; Thick: 5\u2009mm) and two convolution kernels (Sharp: B70f/B70s; Smooth: B30f/B31f/B31s), which constituted four groups: (1) Thin-Sharp, (2) Thin-Smooth, (3) Thick-Sharp, and (4) Thick-Smooth. Machine learning algorithms selected and combined 1,695 quantitative image features to build prediction models. The performance of prediction models was assessed by calculating the area under the curve (AUC). The best prediction model yielded AUC (95%CI)\u2009=\u20090.83 (0.68, 0.92) using the Thin-Smooth reconstruction setting. The AUC of models using thick slices was significantly lower than that of thin slices (P\u2009<\u200910), whereas the impact of reconstruction kernel was not significant. Our study showed that the optimal prediction of EGFR mutational status in early stage LACs was achieved by using thin CT-scan slices, independently of convolution kernels. Results from the prediction model suggest that tumor heterogeneity is associated with EGFR mutation.",

        "abstract": "We studied the reliability of radiomic features on abdominal computed tomography (CT) images reconstructed with multiple CT image acquisition settings using the ACR (American College of Radiology) CT Phantom. Twenty-four sets of CT images of the ACR CT phantom were attained from a GE Discovery 750HD scanner using 24 different image acquisition settings, combinations of 4 tube currents (25, 50, 100, 200 Effective mAs), 3 slice thicknesses (1.25, 2.5, 5 mm), and 2 convolution kernels (STANDARD and SOFT). Polyethylene (-95 HU) and acrylic (120 HU) of the phantom model were selected for calculating real feature value; a noise-free, computer-generated phantom image series that reproduced the 2 objects and the background was used for calculating reference feature value. Feature reliability was defined as the degree of predicting reference feature value from real feature value. Radiomic features  gray-level co-occurrence matrix ()y were investigated. The value of   \u2265 0.85 was considered to be of high reliability. The reliability of  and  were high across all image acquisition settings. At 200 Effective mAs, all features except  showed high reliability, whereas at 25 Effective mAs, most features (except  and ) showed low reliability. From high to low, reliability was ranked in the following order: , ,  and . CT image acquisition settings affected the reliability of radiomic features. High reliable features were attained from images reconstructed at high tube current and thick slice thickness.",

        "abstract": "Objective:  Computer-aided detection (CAD) systems for computed tomography colonography (CTC) can automatically detect colorectal polyps. The main problem of currently developed CAD-CTC systems is the numerous false positives (FPs) caused by the existence of complicated colon structures (e.g., haustral fold, residual fecal material, inflation tube, and ileocecal valve). This study proposes a CAD-CTC scheme using shape index, multiscale enhancement filters, and radiomic features to address the FP issue.  Methods:  Shape index and multiscale enhancement filter calculated in the Gaussian smoothed geodesic distance field are combined to generate the polyp candidates. A total of 440 well-defined radiomic features collected from previous radiomic studies and 200 newly developed radiomic features are used to construct a supervised classification model to reduce the numerous FPs.  Results:  The proposed CAD-CTC scheme was evaluated on 152 oral contrast-enhanced CT datasets from 76 patients with 103 polyps \u22655\u00a0mm. The detection results were 98.1% and 95.3% by-polyp sensitivity and per-scan sensitivity, respectively, with the same FP rate of 1.3 FPs per dataset for polyps \u22655\u00a0mm.   Conclusion:  Experimental results indicate that the proposed CAD-CTC scheme can achieve high sensitivity while maintaining a low FP rate.  Significance:  The proposed CAD-CTC scheme would be a beneficial tool in clinical colon examination.",

        "abstract": "Computer-aided detection (CAD) systems can assist radiologists in reducing the interpretation time and improving the detection results in computed tomographic colonography (CTC). However, existing false positives (FPs) impair the advantages of CAD systems. This study aims to develop new morphological features for FP reduction while maintaining high detection sensitivity. Volumetric feature maps are computed for each polyp candidate by using 3D geodesic distance transformation, circular transformation (CcT), and quantized convergence index (QCI) filters. Then, new morphological features are developed based on the curvature, fractal dimension, and volumetric feature maps. To the best of our knowledge, we are also the first to develop 3D CcT and QCI filters specifically for colonic polyps. The new morphological features were evaluated to reduce FPs by using 456 oral contrast-enhanced CT scans from 228 patients with 130 polyps \u03bc5 mm. For comparison, the well-defined features from our previous work were used to generate a baseline reference. The additional use of the new morphological features reduced the FP rate from 4.2 to 2.0 FPs per scan (i.e., 52.4% FP reduction percentage) at 96.2% by-polyp sensitivity and from 4.5 to 2.1 FPs per scan (i.e., 53.3% FP reduction percentage) at 93.9% per-scan sensitivity for polyps \u03bc5 mm. Experimental results indicate that the new morphological features can effectively reduce the FP rate without sacrificing detection sensitivity. We believe that the newly developed morphological features would advance the CAD systems to assist radiologists in interpreting CTC images.",

        "abstract": "State-of-the-art computer-aided detection (CAD) systems for colonic polyps in computed tomographic colonography (CTC) tend to yield high detection sensitivities with high false positive (FP) rates. This paper proposes a novel CTC CAD system using 3-D radiomic features that can obtain high detection sensitivity at low FP rate. Our previous shape-based methods are used to generate polyp candidates. Then, a wide variety of radiomic features are developed in the 3-D domain for each initial candidate, including the multiscale Weber local descriptors and the statistical descriptors calculated from various volumetric feature maps on the basis of computed tomography (CT) density, CT gradient, fractal dimension, curvature, and fast radial symmetry transform. These new 3-D radiomic features can characterize polyp candidates in terms of the shape, texture heterogeneity, and salient pattern. FP reduction is finally performed by Random Forests with a developed score rank method to tune the training set. 510 fluid-tagging CT scans from 255 patients with 130 polyps \u22655 mm were utilized to validate the proposed system in the fivefold cross-validation strategy. The detection result reached 98.5% by-polyp sensitivity at 2.0 FPs per scan for polyps \u22655 mm. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system yielded a detection performance with high sensitivity and low FP rate. We believe that the proposed system would assist radiologists in increasing the detection accuracy and reducing the interpretation time during colon cancer screening.",

        "abstract": "A simple theoretical dynamic model with a linearized damping coefficient is proposed for the gap resonance problem, as often referred to as the piston mode wave motion in a narrow gap formed by floating bodies. The relationship among the resonant response amplitude and frequency, the reflection and transmission coefficients, the gap width, and the damping coefficient is obtained. A quantitative link between the damping coefficient of the theoretical dynamic model (\u03b5) and that devised for the modified potential flow model (up) is established, namely, up=3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c9n)/8 (where \u03c9n is the natural frequency). This link clarifies the physical meaning of the damping term introduced into the modified potential flow model. A new explicit approach to determine the damping coefficient for the modified potential model is proposed, without resorting to numerically tuning the damping coefficient by trial and error tests. The effects of the body breadth ratio on the characteristics of the gap resonance are numerically investigated by using both the modified potential flow model and the viscous RNG turbulent model. It is found that the body breadth ratio has a significant nonlinear influence on the resonant wave amplitude and the resonant frequency. With the modified potential flow model with the explicit damping coefficient, reasonable predictions are made in good agreement with the numerical solutions of the viscous fluid model.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The laying of subsea pipelines often produces situations where the pipeline is suspended above the seabed due to local erosion of sediment. In this paper, flow induced vibration of a circular cylinder close to a plane boundary in an oscillatory flow is studied through two-dimensional numerical simulations. The circular cylinder and the plane boundary represents a pipeline and the seabed, respectively. It is found that the plane boundary affects the vibration amplitude in the cross-flow direction significantly. The vibration in the vertical direction ceases if reduced velocity exceeds 6 for  KC \u00a0=\u00a05 and 12 for  KC \u00a0=\u00a010, respectively. The vibration in the cross-flow direction stops when the reduced velocity exceeds a critical value because the effective  KC  number and the effective reduced velocity, which are both based on the relative velocity of the cylinder to the fluid motion, are extremely small. For  KC \u00a0=\u00a010, the vortex shedding is found to be in one pair regime for most of the reduced velocities and non-vortex shedding regime exists at large reduced velocities. Because the shear layers generated from the plane boundary attract the vortices generated from the cylinder, vortex shedding occurs only at the bottom side of the cylinder.",

Simulations are performed for rotation rates of \u03b1 = 0, 0.5, and 1 and a range of reduced velocities from 1 to 13, which covers the entire lock-in regime.

It is found that the lift force resulted from rotational flow on the circular cylinder is always in anti-phase with the inertia force and induces the discrepancies between the results. The influence factors on the magnitude of the lift force, especially the correlation between the stagnation-point position and the wave amplitude, and the effect of the vortex shedding are investigated by further examination on the flow fields around the cylinder. The viscous numerical calculations at different wave frequencies showed that the wave frequency has also significant influence on the wave forces. Under higher frequency and larger amplitude wave action, vortex shedding from the circular cylinder will appear and influence the wave forces on the cylinder substantially.",

Two-dimensional Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations with shear stress transport (SST)  k - \u03c9  turbulence closure were solved using a Petrov\u2013Galerkin finite element method (PG-FEM). The effects of the seabed roughness  k   s  / D  and the Keulegan-Carpenter number  KC = U   m   T/D  on the hydrodynamic force coefficients were investigated, where  k   s   is the Nikuradseu0027s equivalent roughness,  T  is the period of oscillatory flow and  U   m   is the amplitude of the oscillatory velocity. The diameter of the submarine pipeline is fixed at  D \u202f=\u202f0.1\u202fm. The Reynolds number, defined as  Re  =  U   m   D/\u03c5  (where  \u03bd  is the kinetic fluid viscosity), ranges from 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 4  to 4.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 4 . The numerical results show that the boundary-layer thickness increases with  k   s  . Hydrodynamic force coefficients are significantly affected by  \u03b4/D  in the range of  \u03b4/D \u202f\u223c\u202fO(1), while  \u03b4/D  depends on  k   s  / D  and  KC  number.

        "title": "Impulse waves generated by subaerial landslides of combined block mass and granular material",
        "abstract": "Abstract   Experimental results, based on two-dimensional (2-D) laboratory tests, for impulse waves generated by subaerial landslides of combined solid block and granular materials are presented in this study. The results are compared with those of individual models of pure solid block and granular landslides. By considering an identical slide mass and release height, the effect of the mass ratio  m * on wave generation was investigated. The mass ratio is defined as  m *\u00a0=\u00a0 M  B / M , where  M  B  is the mass of the solid block,  M \u202f=\u202f M  B \u00a0+\u00a0 M  G  is the total mass and  M  G  is the mass of the granular portion. The experimental results show that the combined landslides with  m *\u00a0=\u00a00.6 and 0.8 in this study generally produce much larger impulse waves in the impact zone compared with those triggered by pure solid block landslides ( m *\u00a0=\u00a01) and pure granular landslides ( m *\u00a0=\u00a00). This suggests that the primary wave amplitudes of impulse waves might have been underestimated in previous laboratory tests with solely solid or granular assemblies when using the same slide mass and release height. The larger primary wave amplitudes of the combined landslides compared with those of the pure solid block landslides are mainly attributed to the relatively large thickness of the combined landslides and the continuous motion of the granular portion, as the inside solid block stops at the hill slope toe. Compared with pure granular landslides, combined landslides generally have a larger Froude number and slide thickness, which account for the larger primary wave amplitudes. The latter plays a quantifiably more important role \u2013 nearly two times that of the former. The effects of the hill slope angle  \u03b1 , and the grain size of the granular materials  D , were also studied in this work. Four different hill slope angles ( \u03b1 \u202f=\u202f22.5\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 37.5\u00b0 and 45\u00b0) and four different mean grain diameters ( D \u202f=\u202f5\u202fmm, 10\u202fmm, 20\u202fmm and 30\u202fmm) were tested. By comparing the measured maxima of the wavelet spectra obtained via a wavelet transform method with those reconstructed by means of the phase celerity of the solitary wave  c  s  and the group celerity of linear wave  c  g ( f ), it is found that the measured maxima travel at either  c  s  or  c  g ( f ), depending on the landslide type and the hill slope angle  \u03b1 . However, the celerity of the measured maxima for the high frequency is lower than  c  g ( f ) and  c  s  for the impulse waves generated by combined landslides when  \u03b1 \u202f\u2264\u202f37.5\u00b0 in this study. Further investigations show that the wave amplitude decreases rapidly during wave propagation, following an exponential function. The decrease in the wave amplitude during propagation is mainly attributed to dispersion.",

Simulation approach yields a result that, the light output power (LOP) and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of sample with the completely undoped LQB are both improved compared to cases of fully doping and step-doping of the LQB structures. The key factors for the performance improvement are decrease of average electric field strength within the last quantum well layer and increase of the effective barrier height for electrons, and thereby reducing the leakage of electrons and then improving the radiative recombination rates, which suggests that keeping the LQB undoped is of great potential for design and application of high-efficiency AlGaN-based DUV LEDs.",

It is found the gradient ILs can greatly weaken the negative influence from the polarization effects for the Ga- polarity case, and the highest conversion efficiency (\u03b7) of 2.18% can be obtained in the structure with a linear increase of In composition in the IL from bottom to top. This is mainly attributed to the adsorptions of more photons caused by the higher In composition in the IL closer to the p-GaN window layer. In contrast, for the N-polarity case, the SC structure with an InGaN IL adopting fixed In composition prevails over the ones adopting the gradient-In-composition IL, where the highest \u03b7 of 9.28% can be obtained at x of 0.62. N-polarity SC structures are proven to have greater potential preparations in high-efficient InGaN SCs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Characteristics of AlGaN-based deep-ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (DUV-LEDs) with step-like and Al-composition graded quantum wells have been investigated. The simulation results show that compared to DUV-LEDs with the conventional AlGaN multiple quantum wells (MQWs) structure, the light output power (LOP) and efficiency droop of DUV-LEDs with the Al-composition graded wells were remarkably improved. The key factor accounting for the improved performance is ascribed to the better modulation of carrier distribution in the quantum wells to increase the overlap between electron and hole wavefunctions, which contributes to more efficient recombination of electrons and holes, and thereby a significant enhancement in the LOP.",

        "abstract": "We pose the decompose-and-pack or DAP problem, which tightly combines shape decomposition and packing. While in general, DAP seeks to decompose an input shape into a small number of parts which can be efficiently packed, our focus is geared towards 3D printing. The goal is to optimally decompose-and-pack a 3D object into a printing volume to minimize support material, build time, and assembly cost. We present Dapper, a global optimization algorithm for the DAP problem which can be applied to both powder- and FDM-based 3D printing. The solution search is top-down and iterative. Starting with a coarse decomposition of the input shape into few initial parts, we progressively pack a pile in the printing volume, by iteratively docking parts, possibly while introducing cuts, onto the pile. Exploration of the search space is via a prioritized and bounded beam search, with breadth and depth pruning guided by local and global DAP objectives. A key feature of Dapper is that it works with pyramidal primitives, which are packing- and printing-friendly. Pyramidal shapes are also more general than boxes to reduce part counts, while still maintaining a suitable level of simplicity to facilitate DAP optimization. We demonstrate printing efficiency gains achieved by Dapper, compare to state-of-the-art alternatives, and show how fabrication criteria such as cut area and part size can be easily incorporated into our solution framework to produce more physically plausible fabrications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Porous structures exist widely in both natural materials and our daily life. Thanks to the properties of being lightweight, sustainable and cost efficient, it has been applied to a great extent in material engineering, meanwhile achieving much attention in shape optimization for 3D printing. However, current efforts on modeling porous structures in a given shape either consider uniform pore distributions, or regard the physical constraints as an underlying scalar field, both generating pores in an isotropic manner. The limitation is that the intrinsic directional properties of some physical terms like stresses or elasticities are not considered. It is still challenging to adapt the porous structure with the input tensor field. In this paper, we present an algorithm for modeling anisotropic porous structure, based on anisotropic centroidal Voronoi tessellations and an iteratively optimization framework in a 2.5D domain. Comparisons with isotropic porous structures show that our anisotropic structures have better adaption with the stress tensor field and thus gain better strength-to-weight ratio for the 3D printed model.",

        "abstract": "3D printed objects are rapidly becoming prevalent in science, technology and daily life. An important question is how to obtain strong and durable 3D models using standard printing techniques. This question is often translated to computing smartly designed interior structures that provide strong support and yield resistant 3D models. In this paper we suggest a combination between 3D printing and material injection to achieve strong 3D printed objects. We utilize triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) to define novel interior support structures. TPMS are closed form and can be computed in a simple and straightforward manner. Since TPMS are smooth and fully connected, we utilize them to define channels that adequately distribute injected materials in the shape interior. To account for weak regions, TPMS channels are locally optimized according to the shape stress field. After the object is printed, we simply inject the TPMS channels with materials that solidify and yield a strong inner structure that supports the shape. Our method allows injecting a wide range of materials in an object interior in a fast and easy manner. Results demonstrate the efficiency of strong printing by combining 3D printing and injection together.",

        "abstract": "We present a technique for designing three-dimensional- (3D) printed perforated lampshades that project continuous grayscale images onto the surrounding walls. Given the geometry of the lampshade and a target grayscale image, our method computes a distribution of tiny holes over the shell, such that the combined footprints of the light emanating through the holes form the target image on a nearby diffuse surface. Our objective is to approximate the continuous tones and the spatial detail of the target image to the extent possible within the constraints of the fabrication process. To ensure structural integrity, there are lower bounds on the thickness of the shell, the radii of the holes, and the minimal distances between adjacent holes. Thus, the holes are realized as thin tubes distributed over the lampshade surface. The amount of light passing through a single tube may be controlled by the tube\u2019s radius and by its orientation (tilt angle). The core of our technique thus consists of determining a suitable configuration of the tubes: their distribution across the relevant portion of the lampshade, as well as the parameters (radius, tilt angle) of each tube. This is achieved by computing a capacity-constrained Voronoi tessellation over a suitably defined density function and embedding a tube inside the maximal inscribed circle of each tessellation cell.",

Here, pyridine-grafted diblock copolymer poly(caprolactone-graft-pyridine)-block-poly(caprolactone) [P(CL-g-Py)-b-PCL] was prepared through a combination of ring-opening polymerization and Cu(I) catalyzed azide\u2013alkyne cycloaddition reaction. CSNPs could be readily constructed by the self-assembly of transferrin (Tf) and P(CL-g-Py)-b-PCL, which showed a narrower range of particle sizes, improved stability, and higher loading capacity for anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX), compared with similar particles prepared from the coassembly of Tf and P4VP. Additionally, the drug-loaded Tf/P(CL-g-Py)-b-PCL CSNPs could effectively target MCF7 cancer cells via the binding of Tf to transferrin receptors (TfR).",

The resulting SiO-PMAA--PNIPAM particles dispersed individually in an aqueous solution at a high pH and a low temperature but reversibly agglomerated under acidic conditions or at elevated temperatures. These dual-responsive nanoparticles were used as carriers to deliver the model drug doxorubicin (DOX) with unusually high entrapment efficiency and loading content, which is due to the small size (15 nm), light weight of the cores, and high graft density (0.619 chains/nm) achieved by SI-RAFT polymerization. The release rate was controlled by both the pH and temperature of the surrounding medium. Moreover, these particles selectively precipitated at acidic conditions with increased temperature, which may enhance their ability to accumulate at tumor sites. Cytotoxicity studies demonstrated that DOX-loaded nanoparticles are highly active against Hela cells and more effective than free DOX of an equivalent dose. A cellular uptake study revealed that SiO-PMAA--PNIPAM nanoparticles could successfully deliver DOX molecules into the nuclei of Hela cells. All these features indicated that SiO-PMAA--PNIPAM nanoparticles are a promising candidate for therapeutic applications.",

The resulting rod-like virus particles displaying integrin binding motifs were biocompatible with Neuro 2A (N2a), a mouse neural crest-derived cell line, and could promote the neurite outgrowth of N2a. The genetically modified viruses could be assembled with aligned orientation in the capillary by applying a shear force.

        "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated rapid osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on substrates with plant viruses modified nanotopographical cues as a promising strategy for bone repair; however, the mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that the highly structurally ordered virus coat proteins, responsible for targeting specific cellular components, are critical for the osteogenesis promotion. In this study, hybrid viral gold nanorods were prepared to explore the effects of highly orderly arranged virus coat proteins on osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. The results herein indicate that it is the nanotopographical cues modified by structurally ordered virus nanoparticles, not the chemical properties of virus surface that mediate osteogenesis. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) expression is significantly increased and serves as a modulator that mediates the osteogenic differentiation in response to the viral particle coatings. After BMP-2 is inhibited by Noggin, the osteogenesis promoting effects are significantly compromised, demonstrated by lower alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium sequestration. This study reveals that plant virus modified nanotopographical substrates promote osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs through increasing BMP-2 autocrine. It provides key insights to engineering functional materials for rapid bone repair.",

        "abstract": "Inbound tourism market is stressed by Chinese tourism industry.It can be segmented by many variables.As one of the variables,motivation is proved to be very useful in market segmentation.This paper provides a case study of inbound tourists in Guilin and Yangshuo,segments Chinese inbound tourism market by motivation,and analyzes the differences of tourists' motivation,demographic and trip characteristics.The measurement scale of tourist motivation is adapted from previous researches.The data from over 600 tourists visiting Guilin and Yangshuo is collected during October and November 2008,the response rate was 95.6%,602 tourists' data is used in this research.In this study,Varimax factor analysis is used to extract motivation factors,and K-means cluster is used to cluster inbound tourists based on motivation factors.The results indicate that four motivation factors play the great role,which are fantasy/physical,relaxation,culture,and entertainment.Cultural motivation is the dominant motivation of inbound tourists.K-means cluster finds three types of tourists who have different dominant motivation,which are relaxation-seeking,want-it-all,and culture-seeking.These three types of tourists show different characteristics on age,marriage status,nationality,travel organization and companion.The dominant motivations of relaxation-seeking tourists are relaxation,e-motionally and physically refreshment.The biggest segment market is want-it-all tourists,who have multiple main motivations and seek to satisfy their many needs.The distributions of age and marriage status of the sec-ond cluster tourists are similar with the first cluster tourists.The main motivations of culture-seeking tourists are to gain knowledge of the new places,to visit historical and cultural sites.This type of tourists are older,married and like group travel more.But this study cannot find any difference of three types of tourists on gender,education,decision-making time,and time to stay.These findings are very helpful to tailored marketing and marketing efficiency improving.",

        "abstract": "The tourist-host contact is generally considered helpful for improving mutual understanding and respect,but empirical studies have not obtained convincing results.Some studies show that tourist-guest contact can lead to positive attitude change,but others do not,and some studies even show negative attitude change.Factors such as the short duration and superficial nature of the tourist-guest contact make it difficult to obtain good results.Previous studies of the tourist-guest contact effect mostly focus on international tourism,but few studies have been done about domestic tourism.This study investigates the effect of tourist-guest contact on perceived destination image and tourist satisfaction in domestic context-the case of Yangshuo,China. The constructs' measurement questionnaires are adapted from previous researches.The tourist-guest contact preference scale is adapted from Reisinger & Turner's study on cultural differences.The destination image scale is adapted from Baloglu & McCleary's study on destination image formation.The tourist satisfaction scale is adapted from Yoon et al.'s study on relationship among motivation,satisfaction and loyalty.The data from 292 domestic tourists visiting Yangshuo were collected during October and November 2008,and the response rate was 91.3%.In this study,a structural equation model is used for theoretical testing and development.First,exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses are used to test the applicability of tourist destination image and tourist-contact preference scales.Second,confirmatory factor analysis is used to test the total measurement model.Finally,structural model analysis is used to test the hypothesis. The results show that tourist-guest contact preference has a direct significant effect on perceived destination image,perceived destination image has a direct significant effect on tourist satisfaction,but tourist-guest contact preference has no direct significant effect on tourist satisfaction.Specifically,tourist-guest contact preference is comprised of two dimensions: close contact and moderate contact.Close contact has a positive direct significant effect on cognitive image,and has a negative effect on affective image though it is insignificant at 0.05 level.Close contact has an indirect effect on satisfaction through the mediate variable of destination image,cognitive and affective images have direct significant effects on satisfaction,cognitive image has an indirect effect on satisfaction via affective image.The theoretical and managerial significance of these findings is discussed in the final section.",

        "abstract": "Tourism destination image is a very important factor to influence tourism behavior. Taking Zhouzhuang in Suzhou as a case, this paper selects five cities of different distance from Zhouzhua(Shanghai ,Nanjing ,Hefei, Jinan , Chengdu) as sampling region, applies quantitative methods to analyze Zhouzhaung 's tourism image and distance's influence on tourism image. The finding discovers that tourists and potential tourists from different distances have different perceived images on Zhouzhuang, distance difference mainly exists in cognitive and evaluation image, and no distance difference exists in total image:The farther the distance is, the lower the degree of knowing the cognitive and evaluation items is; The degree of knowing holistic cognitive image is greater, attribute cognitive image is lower;The farther the distance is, the greater the degree of good fame of cognitive and evaluation image is. In total, Zhouzhaung is an unsophisticated and beautiful region of rivers and lakes. The tourism image of Zhouzhuang is basically positive , but the degree of good fame is not very great, meanwhile, there are bad images like heavily trade atmosphere and crowd. Zhouzhuang can carry out it's image and market strategy based on the character that the degree of knowing is higher and the degree of good fame is lower in near market, the degree of knowing is lower and the degree of good fame is higher in farther market. Future research can select other case region and sample region, and apply more methods such as the integration of questionnaire and interview. Otherwise, the other impact factors that influence tourism destination image such as experience, information, demographics can be studied in the background of Chinese culture.",

This expansion has created conditions that facilitate the generation of new recombinant strains. A molecular epidemiologic survey among MSM in 11 provinces/cities around China was conducted from 2008 to 2013. Based on pol nucleotide sequences, a total of 19 strains (1.95%) belonged to the CRF55_01B were identified from 975 MSM in 7 provinces, with the prevalence range from 1.5% to 12.5%. Near full length genome (NFLG) sequences from six epidemiologically-unlinked MSM were amplified for analyzing evolutionary history, an identical genome structure composed of CRF01_AE and subtype B with four unique recombination breakpoints in the pol region were identified. Bayesian molecular clock analyses for both CRF01_AE and B segments indicated that the estimated time of the most recent common ancestors of CRF55_01B was around the year 2000. Our study found CRF55_01B has spread throughout the most provinces with high HIV-1 prevalence and highlights the importance of continual surveillance of dynamic changes in HIV-1 strains, the emergence of new recombinants, and the need for implementing effective prevention measures specifically targeting the MSM population in China.",

Paucity of national-level information regarding the burden and predictors of this progressive epidemic of new infections called for a multi-centric, timely and comprehensive investigation.  Methods  Mixed methods were used to recruit MSM (MSM) from seven cities in China between 2012 and 2013. Early and established HIV infections were estimated by Western Blot and BED HIV-1 capture enzyme immunoassay. Syphilis and herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) were also tested.  Results  A total of 4496 eligible MSM were recruited. The majority was aged \u226435 years (77\u00b75%), migrants (60\u00b73%), never married (69\u00b78%), and played receptive role in anal sex (70\u00b75%). The HIV prevalence was 9\u00b79%, and 41\u00b79% were recently infected, with HIV incidence of 8\u00b79/100 Person-Years (95% CI: 7\u00b76\u201310\u00b72). The prevalence of history HSV-2 and syphilis were 12\u00b75% and 8\u00b75%, respectively. Early HIV infection was associated with having multiple male partners (aOR = 1\u00b74, 95% CI 1\u00b71\u20131\u00b79), recreational drug use (aOR = 2\u00b72, 95% CI 1\u00b76\u20133\u00b70), anal bleeding (aOR = 2\u00b71, 95% CI 1\u00b74\u20133\u00b70), circumcision experience (aOR = 2\u00b70, 95% CI 1\u00b73\u20133\u00b71), syphilis infection (aOR = 2\u00b78, 95% CI 1\u00b79\u20134\u00b73) and history HSV-2 infection (aOR = 2\u00b73, 95% CI 1\u00b75\u20133\u00b73).  Conclusion  High rate of early HIV infection is potentially resulting in progressive deterioration of the overall HIV epidemic among MSM in China. Targeted interventions to address high-risk MSM including those having multiple partners, history of recreational drug use and syphilis or HSV-2 infection seemed to be the need of the hour.",

        "abstract": "Introduction : Literature on the age at first anal intercourse (AFAI) among men who have sex with men (MSM) is limited. We aimed to elucidate the evolution of AFAI and the factors associated with early AFAI, based on a large sample of MSM in China.   Methods : We collected information on the demographics and sexual behaviours of MSM from seven large cities in China from 2012 to 2013. Blood samples were collected for HIV serology. AFAI was calculated for MSM born in different time periods. Linear regression models were used to explore factors associated with younger AFAI.   Results : A total of 4491 MSM (median age: 27 years, median AFAI: 21 years) were recruited. Median AFAI decreased steadily from 33 years of age among MSM born from 1940 to 1959 to 18 years of age among MSM born from 1990 to 1996. Factors significantly associated with younger AFAI included more recent birth cohort, being unmarried or living with a male partner, being a student or industry worker, the gender of the first partner being male, and using Rush or Ecstasy in the past six months ( p  for all u003c0.05).   Conclusions : AFAI among MSM in China has considerably decreased over the past few decades. The decreasing AFAI and factors associated with younger AFAI point to the necessity of early sex education and control of recreational drug use among MSM in China.

        "abstract": " To evaluate the efficacy and primary safety of treatment with artesunate in reducing ocular neovascularization in humans.  Five patients with corneal, iris, and retinal neovascularization and no light perception were treated with intravitreal injections of artesunate 80\u2009\u03bcg. Visual acuity, anterior segment photography, fundus fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography were used to evaluate efficacy, while intraocular pressure (IOP) and lens opacity degree were employed to evaluate safety. The primary endpoint was attenuation of neovascularization as determined at 24 weeks, with the last posttreatment follow-up at 52 weeks.  Corneal and iris neovascularization, which were secondary to fundus ischemic diseases and retinal neovascularization in all 5 patients, were attenuated after 1 or 2 injections by the 52-week follow-up. Retinal neovascularization was also attenuated, and papilledema was alleviated. The average IOP fell from 25.5\u2009mmHg to 17.66\u2009mmHg.  This pilot study determined that intravitreal artesunate injection is efficacious for reducing corneal, iris, and retinal neovascularization. These results indicate that this drug may be a novel alternative to the currently popular antivascular endothelial growth factor drugs used to suppress ocular neovascularization and improve visual function.",

        "abstract": "Background  Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes and one of the main causes of irreversible vision impairment in the working-age population. Multiple studies have demonstrated the significantly high prevalence of depression in patients with DR in recent years. The progression of DR could lead to depression, whereas depressive symptoms often worsen the condition of DR. Therefore, DR is one of the causes of psychosomatic diseases, the treatment for which should combine traditional DR therapy with depression interventions.  Methods  We reviewed existing articles that investigated the association between DR and depression in the context of prevalence, risk factors, biological mechanisms, and treatment indications.  Results  The literature review in this article includes a brief introduction to current studies of depression and DR, followed by a focus on the epidemiology of depression in DR that help doctors better identify potential or existing depression patients upon first diagnosis. The underlying biologic mechanisms between the 2 diseases are briefly reviewed, and potential treatments are addressed.  Conclusions  Depression in patients with DR is not uncommon and has a negative effect on the condition of DR. To achieve optimal prognosis in patients with DR and depression, more attention to combined psychiatric therapies for depression is recommended.",

        "abstract": "Purpose  To evaluate the efficacy of a combined macular buckle under direct vision and 23-gauge pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling in refractory macular hole retinal detachment (MHRD) with extreme high axial myopia.  Design  Prospective, randomised controlled study.  Participants  The study included 98 eyes of 98 patients of MHRD with extreme high axial (u003e30\u2005mm) myopia.  Intervention  Patients were randomly assigned to undergo PPV with ILM peeling (group 1, n=52) or PPV with ILM peeling combined with macular buckle under direct vision (group 2, n=46).  Main outcome measures  Complete ocular examination included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (LogMAR), applanation tonometry, optical biometry, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, colour fundus photography, ultrasound examination and optical coherence tomography at baseline and every follow-up visit.  Results  Initial retinal reattachment rate was significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1 at 12-month postoperatively (\u03c7 2  test, p=0.020). Macular hole closure rate in group 2 was significantly higher than that in group 1 at 3, 12, 18 and 24\u2005months postoperatively (Fisher9s exact test, p  Conclusions  Combined macular buckle under direct vision and PPV with ILM peeling is more effective in treatment of MHRD with extreme high axial (u003e30\u2005mm) myopia.",

NOTCH4 C57BL/6J mice (224 eyes) aged from 3 months to 7 months were examined in this study. Color photography (CP), FFA and OCT imaging were utilized to examine vitreous cavity and retina of mouse eyes. Horizontal and radial OCT scan volume was centered on the optic nerve head. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed to validate PHPV. For color photography and FFA imaging, retrolental irregular fibrovascular membrane-like tissues were found in 33 eyes with/without blood vessels in vitreous cavity. Among them, 31 eyes were visualized with lateral and oblique linear hyperreflective opacities in vitreous cavity using Spectralis OCT. Position of PHPV in posterior segment of eyes was also measured via OCT. Mouse PHPV was validated by H&E staining. Typical hyperreflective opacities in vitreous cavity were detected in PHPV mouse using Spectralis OCT. Spectralis OCT imaging can effectively detect mouse PHPV as color photography and FFA.",

        "abstract": "EAU, an animal model for severe intraocular inflammatory eye diseases, is mediated by both Th1 and Th17 cells. Here, we examined the capacity of TMP778, a selective inhibitor of ROR\u03b3t, to inhibit the development of EAU, as well as the related immune responses. EAU was induced in B10.A mice by immunization with interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP). Treatment with TMP778 significantly inhibited the development of EAU, determined by histological examination. In addition, the treatment suppressed the cellular immune response to IRBP, determined by reduced production of IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3, as well as lower percentages of lymphocytes expressing these cytokines, as compared to vehicle-treated controls. The inhibition of IFN-\u03b3 expression by TMP778 is unexpected in view of this compound being a selective inhibitor of ROR\u03b3t. The observation was further confirmed by the finding of reduced expression of the T-bet (Tbx21) gene, the transcription factor for IFN-\u03b3,\u00a0by cells of TMP778-treated mice. Thus, these data demonstrate the capacity of TMP778 to inhibit pathogenic autoimmunity in the eye and shed new light on its mode of action in vivo.

        "abstract": "Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a retinopathy characterized by retinal neovascularization (RNV) occurring in preterm infants treated with high concentrations of oxygen and may lead to blindness in severe cases. Currently, anti-VEGF therapy is a major treatment for ROP, but it is costly and may cause serious complications. The previous study has demonstrated that melatonin exerted neuroprotective effect against retinal ganglion cell death induced by hypoxia in neonatal rats. However, whether melatonin is anti-angiogenic and neuroglial protective in the progression of ROP remains unknown. Thus, this study was to investigate the effect of melatonin on RNV and neuroglia in the retina of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mice. The results showed a reduction in retinal vascular leakage in OIR mice after melatonin treatment. Besides, the size of retinal neovascular and avascular areas, the number of preretinal neovascular cell nuclei, and the number of proliferative vascular endothelial cells within the neovascular area were significantly decreased in mice treated with melatonin. After oxygen-induced injury, the density of astrocytes was decreased, accompanied by morphologic and functional changes of astrocytes. Besides, retinal microglia were also activated. Meanwhile, the levels of inflammatory factors were elevated. However, these pathologic processes were all hindered by melatonin treatment. Furthermore, HIF-1\u03b1-VEGF pathway was activated in the retina of OIR mice, yet was suppressed in melatonin-treated OIR mice retinas. In conclusion, melatonin prevented pathologic neovascularization, protected neuroglial cells, and exerts anti-inflammation effect via inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1-VEGF pathway in OIR retinas, suggesting that melatonin could be a promising therapeutic agent for ROP.",

        "abstract": "Chronic neuro-inflammation is involved in the death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in glaucoma. The aim of this study is to determine whether wogonin can suppress inflammatory responses and rescue RGCs death after optic nerve crush (ONC), an ideal animal model of glaucoma. Wogonin was administered intraperitoneally 10 min after establishment of ONC model. In this study, wogonin treatment reduced RGCs loss and inhibited RGCs apoptosis demonstrated by the increased Brn3a labeling RGCs at day 14 and the decreased cleaved caspase-3 expression at day 7 after ONC, respectively. In ONC model, number of GFAP-positive glial cells and iba1-positive microglial cells were increased, combined of the elevated level of pro-inflammatory cytokines released in retina at day 7. However, most of these responses were inhibited after wogonin treatment. The level of TLR4 expression, NF-\u03baB-P65 nucleus location and NF-\u03baB-P65 phosphorylation were increased in retina at day 1 after ONC, which was significantly reduced after wogonin treatment. These results demonstrated that wogonin protected RGCs survival and suppressed neuro-inflammation in retina after ONC by inhibiting TLR4-NF-\u03baB pathways. We conclude that wogonin could be a possible strategy for the treatment of glaucoma.",

        "abstract": "Down syndrome candidate region 1 (DSCR1) has two differentially regulated isoforms (DSCR1-1 and DSCR1-4) and is reported to play a role in a number of physiological processes, such as the inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy, attenuation of angiogenesis and carcinogenesis, and protection against neuronal death. However, the function of DSCR1 in the retina is still not clear. Therefore, we analyzed the expression and location of DSCR1 in the retina of neonatal mice with oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), and studied its effects on angiogenesis. The neonatal C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 75\u00a0% O for 5\u00a0days from postnatal day 7 (P7) to P12. At P12, the mice were returned to 21\u00a0% O at room air. The primary retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) were exposed to hypoxia (93\u00a0% N, 5\u00a0% CO, and 2\u00a0% O) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 36\u00a0h. And then the mouse retinal microvascular endothelial cells (mRMECs) were treated with 25\u00a0ng/mL vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or culture medium conditioned by hypoxic RGCs alone, hypoxic RGCs treated with DSCR1-4-siRNA (siDSCR1-4) or hypoxic RGCs treated with siDSCR1-4 and 200\u00a0ng/mL cyclosporin A (CsA), and then primed with VEGF (25\u00a0ng/mL). The expression of DSCR1-4 increased strongly at P16 after OIR. There was no change in messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of DSCR1-1 at P16 after OIR. The increased DSCR1 was mainly located in the RGCs of avascular retina. In addition, DSCR1-4 expression was increased in primary RGCs after hypoxia exposure. There was no change in mRNA expression of DSCR1-1 in primary RGCs after hypoxia exposure. Moreover, DSCR1-4 produced by hypoxic RGCs showed anti-angiogenic properties, with decreased cell proliferation, migration, tube formation, and inflammatory cytokines production. These properties were due to inhibited nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFATc) 1 dephosphorylation and translocation into nuclear in VEGF-treated mRMECs. Using siRNA-mediated knockdown of DSCR1-4 and NFATc1 inhibitor (Cs A) further demonstrated the inhibitory effect of DSCR1-4 on angiogenic properties in VEGF-induced mRMECs, and this effect was NFATc1-dependent. This report describes a novel effect of DSCR1-4 in the aspect of anti-angiogenesis, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for proliferative retinopathies.",

        "abstract": "Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), one of the active ingredients isolated from a Chinese herbal prescription, possesses protective effects against apoptosis in endothelial cells. However, the underlying mechanism of its protective effects in endothelial cells remains to be elucidated. Using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), the present study assessed the protective effects of TMP on CoCl2\u2011induced apoptosis. Following pre\u2011incubation with CoCl2 (150 \u00b5M/ml) for 4 h, the HUVECs were treated with TMP at different concentrations (50, 100 and 200 \u00b5M/ml) for 8 h. TMP upregulated the expression of prolyl hydroxylase (PHD)2, reduced the protein and mRNA expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and reduced the expression of HIF\u20111\u03b1 only at the protein level, not at the mRNA level in HUVECs, in a concentration\u2011dependent manner. Furthermore, silencing of the PHD2 gene with small interfering (si)RNAs abolished the reduction in the expression of hypoxia\u2011inducible factor (HIF)\u20111\u03b1 and VEGF by TMP. In addition, TMP protected CoCl2\u2011induced HUVEC injury via an apoptosis pathway, as characterized by the increased ratio of cell viability and the reduced percentage of apoptotic and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling\u2011positive HUVECs, activation of caspase\u20113, \u20118 and \u20119, B\u2011cell lymphoma (Bcl)\u20112/Bcl\u20112\u2011activated X protein expression, as well as the release of cytochrome c. The protective properties of TMP were partially attributed to the mRNA and protein expression levels of PHD, since silencing of the PHD2 gene with siRNAs abolished these effects. The present study demonstrated that the antiapoptotic effect of TMP in CoCl2\u2011induced HUVECs was, at least in part, via the regulation of the PHD2/HIF-1\u03b1 signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) is a hereditary retinal disease characterized by the bilateral accumulation of large egg yolk\u2011like lesions in the sub\u2011retinal and sub\u2011retinal pigment epithelium spaces. Macular degeneration in BVMD can begin in childhood or adulthood. The variation in the age of onset is not clearly understood. The present study characterized the clinical characteristics of two Chinese patients with either juvenile\u2011onset BVMD or adult\u2011onset BVMD and investigated the underlying genetic variations. A 16\u2011year\u2011old male (Patient 1) was diagnosed with juvenile\u2011onset BVMD and a 43\u2011year\u2011old female (Patient 2) was diagnosed with adult\u2011onset BVMD. Comprehensive ophthalmic examinations were performed, including best\u2011corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, slit\u2011lamp examination, fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, fundus fluorescein angiography imaging and Espion electrophysiology. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes collected from these patients, their family members, and 200 unrelated subjects within in the same population. The 11 exons of the bestrophin\u20111 (BEST1) gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and directly sequenced. Both patients presented lesions in the macular area. In Patient 1, a heterozygous mutation c.903T>G (p.D301E) in exon 8 of the BEST1 gene was identified. This mutation was not present in any of the unaffected family members or the normal controls. Polymorphism phenotyping and the sorting intolerant from tolerant algorithm predicted that the amino acid substitution D301E in bestrophin\u20111 protein was damaging. In Patient 2, a single nucleotide polymorphism c.1608C>T (p.T536T) in exon 10 of the BEST1 gene was identified. These findings expand the spectrum of BEST1 genetic variation and will be valuable for genetic counseling and the development of therapeutic interventions for patients with BVMD.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the genetic changes in two Chinese patients with Stickler syndrome, manifested as bilateral retinal detachment and peripheral retinal degeneration. Complete ophthalmic examinations, including best\u2011corrected visual acuity, slit\u2011lamp examination and fundus examination, were performed. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes of the peripheral blood collected from the patients, their unaffected family members and 200 unrelated control subjects from the same population. Next\u2011generation sequencing of established genes associated with ocular disease was performed. A heterozygous collagen type\u00a0II \u03b11\u00a0chain (COL2A1) mutation c.1310G>C (p.R437P) in exon\u00a021 was identified in Family\u00a01 and a heterozygous COL2A1 mutation c.2302\u20111G>A in intron 34 was identified in Family\u00a02. The functional effects of the mutations were assessed by polymorphism phenotyping (PolyPhen) and sorting intolerant from tolerant (SIFT) analysis. The c.1310G>C mutation was predicted to damage protein structure and function, and the c.2302\u20111G>A mutation was predicted to result in a splicing defect. The findings of the current study expand the established mutation spectrum of COL2A1, and may facilitate genetic counseling and development of therapeutic strategies for patients with Stickler syndrome.",

        "abstract": "Crouzon syndrome, a dominantly inherited disorder and the most common type of craniosynostosis syndrome, is caused by mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor\u00a02 (FGFR\u00a02) gene, and characterized by craniosynostosis, shallow orbits, ocular proptosis, midface hypoplasia and a curved, beak\u2011like nose. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR\u00a02) gene in two Chinese families with Crouzon syndrome and to characterize the associated clinical features. Two families underwent complete ophthalmic examination, and three patients in two families were diagnosed with Crouzon syndrome. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes of peripheral blood samples, which were collected from the family members and 200\u00a0unrelated control subjects from the same population. Exons\u00a08 and 10 of the FGFR\u00a02 gene were amplified using polymerase chain reaction analysis and were directly sequenced. Ophthalmic examinations, including best\u2011corrected visual acuity, slit\u2011lamp examination, fundus examination and Computerized Tomography scans, and physical examinations were performed to exclude systemic diseases. These patients were affected with shallow orbits and ocular proptosis, accompanied by midface hypoplasia, craniosynostosis, strabismus or papilloedema, with clinically normal hands and feet. A heterozygous FGFR\u00a02 missense mutation, c.811\u2011812insGAG (p.273insGlu) in exon 8 was identified in the affected individual, but not in the unaffected family members or the normal control individuals in family 1. In family\u00a02, another heterozygous FGFR 2 missense mutation, c.842A>G (P.Tyr281Cys or Y281C), in exon 8 was identified in the affected boy and his mother, but not in the unaffected family members or the normal control individuals. Although FGFR\u00a02 gene mutations and polymorphisms have been reported in various ethnic groups, particularly in the area of osteology, the present study reported for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the identification of two novel FGFR\u00a02 gene mutations in Chinese patients with Crouzon syndrome.

        "abstract": "Congenital aniridia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a variable degree of hypoplasia or absence of iris. It is frequently associated with keratopathy, cataract, juvenile\u2011onset glaucoma and foveal and optic nerve hypoplasia. Mutations in the Paired Box 6 (PAX6) gene on chromosome 11p13 have been demonstrated to cause aniridia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the genetic variations of PAX6 in two sporadic patients from southern China with classic congenital aniridia and cataract. Complete ophthalmic and physical examinations were performed, including best\u2011corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, slit\u2011lamp examination, fundus examination, optical coherence tomography, ultrasound biomicroscopy, and Pentacam scanning. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes of peripheral blood collected from the two patients, their unaffected parents and 200 unrelated control subjects from the same population. Exons 4\u201113 of the PAX6 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced directly. Patient 1 was affected with aniridia accompanied by congenital cataract and nystagmus. A novel heterozygous PAX6 frameshift mutation c.277delG (p.Glu93SerfsX31) in exon 6 was identified in this patient. Patient 2 was presented with aniridia, congenital cataract, lens subluxation and glaucoma. A recurrent nonsense mutation c.718C>T (p.Arg240X) in exon 9 was identified in this patient. The present results expand the mutation spectrum of PAX6 and will be valuable for genetic counseling in the affected families. Additionally, the identification of these mutations reiterates the importance of PAX6 in ocular development and sheds light on the pathogenesis of congenital aniridia.",

        "abstract": "Recent reform of medical education highlights the growing concerns about the capability of the current educational model to equip medical school students with essential skills for future career development. In the field of ophthalmology, although many attempts have been made to address the problem of the decreasing teaching time and the increasing load of course content, a growing body of literature indicates the need to reform the current ophthalmology teaching strategies. Flipped classroom is a new pedagogical model in which students develop a basic understanding of the course materials before class, and use in-class time for learner-centered activities, such as group discussion and presentation. However, few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of the flipped classroom in ophthalmology education. This study, for the first time, assesses the use of flipped classroom in ophthalmology, specifically glaucoma and ocular trauma clerkship teaching. A total number of 44 international medical school students from diverse background were enrolled in this study, and randomly divided into two groups. One group took the flipped glaucoma classroom and lecture-based ocular trauma classroom, while the other group took the flipped ocular trauma classroom and lecture-based glaucoma classroom. In the traditional lecture-based classroom, students attended the didactic lecture and did the homework after class. In the flipped classroom, students were asked to watch the prerecorded lectures before the class, and use the class time for homework discussion. Both the teachers and students were asked to complete feedback questionnaires after the classroom. We found that the two groups did not show differences in the final exam scores. However, the flipped classroom helped students to develop skills in problem solving, creative thinking and team working. Also, compared to the lecture-based classroom, both teachers and students were more satisfied with the flipped classroom. Interestingly, students had a more positive attitude towards the flipped ocular trauma classroom than the flipped glaucoma classroom regarding the teaching process, the course materials, and the value of the classroom. Therefore, the flipped classroom model in ophthalmology teaching showed promise as an effective approach to promote active learning.",

It was performed in 2014 and covered 14 hospitals. Newly hospitalized patients with schizophrenia or suspected schizophrenia who met the diagnostic criteria of the  International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems , 10th revision, were recruited. Agitation and related risk factors were evaluated by a questionnaire designed for the survey. General demographic data, disease characteristics, scores on schizophrenia rating scales and agitation rating scales (e.g., Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component [PANSS-EC] and Behavioral Activity Rating Scale [BARS]) were collected. Among the 1512 patients screened in the study, 1400 (92.59%) were eligible. According to the PANSS-EC and BARS, the prevalence of agitation was 60.92% (853 of 1400) and 59.00% (826 of 1400), respectively. The overall prevalence of agitation was 47.50% (665 of 1400). The most important risk factor of agitation was being aggressive at baseline (Modified Overt Aggression Scale score \u22654, odds ratio=6.54; 95% confidence interval=4.93\u20138.69). Other risk factors included a history of aggressive behavior, northern region of residence, involuntary hospitalization, disease severity, low level of education, living alone, being unemployed or retired.",

Prospective, interventional, non-randomized, comparative case series. A total of 54 patients (54 eyes) with acute CSC were enrolled. Twenty-four eyes received 25% threshold power and 30 eyes received 50% threshold power of 577-nm SMPL. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), and complete absorption of subretinal fluid (SRF) were evaluated at 1\u00a0month and 3\u00a0months. The complete absorption rate of SRF in the 50% power group was significantly greater than that in the 25% power group at 1\u00a0month (70.0% vs 25.0%, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and at 3\u00a0months (83.3% vs 54.2%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Mean BCVA improved from 0.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.20 LogMAR to 0.02\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13 LogMAR in the 50% power group and from 0.27\u2009\u00b1\u20090.15 LogMAR to 0.14\u2009\u00b1\u20090.21 LogMAR in the 25% power group with a significant difference between the two groups after 3\u00a0months (p\u2009=\u20090.027). In the 50% power group, the CMT decreased from 491.6\u2009\u00b1\u2009154.8\u00a0\u03bcm at baseline to 231.3\u2009\u00b1\u200992.3\u00a0\u03bcm at 1\u00a0month and 228.2\u2009\u00b1\u200988.1\u00a0\u03bcm at 3\u00a0months, and in the 25% power group, the CMT decreased from 444.9\u2009\u00b1\u2009164.1 to 306.8\u2009\u00b1\u2009102.6\u00a0\u03bcm at 1\u00a0month and 254.5\u2009\u00b1\u2009101.7\u00a0\u03bcm at 3\u00a0months. There was statistical difference of CMT at 1\u00a0month (p\u2009=\u20090.009) but no significant difference at 3\u00a0months between the two groups (p\u2009=\u20090.232).

        "abstract": "Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) is a standard method for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) treatment. However, conventional PRP usually significantly damages the retinal structure and vision. Retinal pattern scanning laser (PASCAL) photocoagulation has emerged as a new technique with fewer complications for the treatment of retinal disorders. This study compares the therapeutic effects of short-pulse PASCAL to conventional single-spot PRP for PDR. Fifty-two PDR patients (104 eyes) were randomly assigned into a short-pulse PASCAL-PRP treatment (SP) group and a conventional PRP treatment (TP) group. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and full-field flash electroretinogram (ERG) data were evaluated before and after the two treatments. The BCVA data between before and after the PRP treatments did not show any significant difference. After the PRP treatment, the b-wave amplitude (b-A) in the dark-adapted 3.0 ERG (p\u2009=\u20090.0005) and the amplitude in the\u00a0light-adapted 3.0 flicker ERG (p\u2009=\u20090.009) were significantly higher in the SP group compared with that of the TP group. In addition, after the PRP treatment, the a-wave implicit time (a-T) of light-adapted 3.0 ERG prolonged significantly in the TP group compared to the SP group. Compared with the parameters before the treatments, the a-A and b-A under dark-adapted 3.0 ERG and\u00a0the b-A under the light-adapted 3.0 ERG in both TP and SP groups after the treatments decreased significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Short-pulse PASCAL-PRP significantly attenuated partial vision damage compared to conventional PRP, although it still caused limited retinal injury and mild reduction in retinal function. These findings suggest that short-pulse PASCAL-PRP is a promising technique for PDR treatment.",

The affected and fellow eyes were given complete examinations. The age, sex, clinical features of the affected eyes, and varied abnormalities of the fellow eyes were analyzed.Forty-three patients with FEVR-RRD were included. The average age was 21.8 \u00b1 10.9 years, and the males (19.9 \u00b1 9.6) were younger than the females (28.1 \u00b1 1.2). Retinal round holes were noted in 32 (71.1%) eyes. In addition, horseshoe retinal tears and giant retinal tears were present in 10 (22.2%) eyes and 3 (6.7%) eyes. Subretinal fibrosis was seen in 20 (44.4%) eyes, and choroidal detachment was shown in 6 (13.3%) of the eyes. A high prevalence of abnormalities was noted in the undetached fellow eyes in the peripheral retina, including vascular leakage in fundus fluorescein angiography (75.6%), lattice degeneration (53.7%), and vitreous traction (51.2%).Male patients with FEVR-RRD experience an earlier onset than females in our series. Retinal tears, even giant tears, could be responsible for FEVR-RRD. The fellow eyes of FEVR-RRD patients were characterized by predetachment changes, which need both lifelong monitoring and timely vision-saving intervention.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of two botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) injection patterns with or without the medial lower eyelid (MLE) in treating benign essential blepharospasm (BEB) and influencing lacrimal drainage. Two different injection patterns of BoNT-A were randomly applied to 98 eyes of 49 BEB patients: MLE Group received a full injection pattern of 5 sites and non-MLE Group received a MLE waived injection pattern of 4 sites. Tear breakup time (BUT), Schirmer I test, lagophthalmos height, and lower lid tear meniscus height (TMH) were measured and Jankovic Rating Scale (JRS) was surveyed before injection and at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after injection. The symptom of BEB was relieved in both groups as suggested by JRS scores at all time points after injection, and MLE Group came up with a better JRS score at 3 months. The increases of Schirmer I test value and TMH in MLE Group were higher than those in non-MLE Group at 1 week after injection. This study shows that the MLE-involved full injection pattern is a better choice for patients with BEB. It has longer-lasting effects in relieving BEB symptoms and better efficacy in reducing lacrimal drainage. Clinical Trials registration number is NCT02327728. ",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to classify combined persistent fetal vasculature (PFV) on the basis of the ultrasonographic and Doppler characteristics. The potential clinical significance for both surgery design and prognosis determination was discussed.A cross-sectional case series.The eyes of 54 children diagnosed with unilateral combined PFV were evaluated using B-mode ultrasound and color Doppler imaging (CDI).Each participant's age at first presentation, diagnosis for referral, gender, family history, and systemic or other ocular anomalies were recorded. Retinal detachment, optic nerve abnormalities, and macular dislocation were also recorded in detail according to the RetCam (Clarity Medical Systems, Pleasanton, CA), ultrasound, and Doppler findings. The PFV eyes were divided into 4 groups on the basis of the ultrasound and CDI findings. Intergroup analysis was performed.Overall and intergroup analyses of the demographic features of the children with PFV were performed. The axial length, depth of the anterior chamber, and lens thickness were compared between the affected eyes and the fellow healthy eyes among the 4 groups.Some 22.2%, 18.5%, 33.3%, and 25.9% of the eyes were grouped into type I (\"I\" shape), II (\"Y\" shape), III (inverted \"Y\" shape), and IV (\"X\" shape) combined PFV, respectively. The age at first presentation for type I was older than that for the other groups (P = 0.014). The axial length was reduced (P = 0.012) and the anterior chamber more shallow (P = 0.011) than in fellow healthy eyes for type IV eyes, but not for the other 3 groups.Ultrasound and CDI are informative screening and diagnostic tools that show characteristic flow patterns in the 4 types of combined PFV. This novel classification system provides new and important information for the diagnosis of PFV and, if validated, may play a role in guiding treatment recommendations in the future.",

Fifty-four patients with VKH in the acute uveitic or convalescent stages, 24 patients with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), and 54 normal participants were enrolled in this prospective, observational study. Enhanced depth imaging spectral-domain optical coherence tomography scans were captured for all subjects to allow for comparison of choroidal morphological findings. Numerous round or oval hyperreflective profiles with hyporeflective cores, corresponding to choroidal vessels, were observed in the choroid of control participants and patients with CSC; whereas the numbers of these profiles were markedly decreased in the choroid of VKH patients in both the acute uveitic and convalescent stages. A reduction in vascular profiles in the choroid is observed in VKH and may aid in the differentiation with disorders such as CSC. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina. 2016;47:1004-1012.].",

        "abstract": "Huangshan Mountain scenic area is one of the famous mountain resorts in China.It is a representative area not only in tourist activities but also in regional environment.In order to understand the impacts of tourist activities on soil,sampling and lab analyses were conducted to survey the soil near the main trails in Huangshan Mountain scenic area.The results were obtained as follows.Tourist disturbance generated a great effect on soil.With the increase of tourist disturbance,the bulk density of soil,pH value of soil and the content of total K increased.In the meantime the content of water,organtic matter,total N,total P in soil and the height of litter layer decreased.There was an obvious relativity between the change in all indexes with the increasing distance away from the trails and the change in the intensities of tourist disturbance.Among the above indexes,the highest correlation was found between the height of litter layer and the intensity of tourist disturbance,followed by the water content of soil and the bulk density of soil.The correlation between the content of total K and the intentity of tourist disturbance was relatively low,and the correlation between the total P and the intensity of tourist dirurbance was the lowest.It is indicated that the sensitives of each index to tourist disturbance were different.Compared with the control areas,soil condition changed evidently in a range of 2 m away from the trails,and reached 20 cm below the surface of soil.The impact on 0~10 cm soil was much greater than on 10~20 cm soil.The effects of tourist disturbance varied in different areas.The correlation between disturbance and effects was evident in heavily used areas and the effects were greater.However,the impact was not always consistent with the use because of different landshapes,plants and other environment factors.In addition,based on the above research,this paper discusses the current problems in studies of the recreational impacts on soil,and puts forward the concrete measures to alleviate the negative effects of tourist disturbance in Huangshan mountain resort.",

At the same time,this paper used a comparison method to discuss the macrofauna captured in Zheshan hill park and Mount Jiuhua scenic area at a similar latitude.Due to the impact of tourism activities,the distribution of macrofauna has the same law on the one hand and differences on the other hand due to different natural environments in these two places.It is found that,in both places along the trail to the inside,the macrofauna increase horizontally and become more concentrated vertically,and both of these phenomena are closely related to the intensity of tourism activity.Likewise,at the quadrats far away from trail,the distribution of macrofauna was slightly affected by tourism activity but strongly affected by natural environment factors.",

The results showed : (1) the seed germination rates of two kinds of plants were negatively linearized a correlated with the strength of tourist and recreational activity. In three tour route experimental groups : The long range, the medium range and the short range, the seed germination rates of Medicago sativa were in sequence of 31.29% , 39.41% and 55.21% , and the rates of Trifolium repens were of 8.42% , 14.62% and 23.89%. The more distant the experimental group is from the tour route, the higher the seed germination rates are. There were significant differences of the rates between the farthest group from the tour route and the nearest one. (2) In four other patterns of the tour route experimental groups : asphalt, cement, step and soil, the seed average germination rates of Medicago sativa were in sequence of 37. 20% , 40. 27% , 41. 28% and 48. 13% , and the rates of Trifolium repens were of 10. 37% , 10.92% , 14.23% and 27.05%. The seed germination rates of tour route experimental region with less tourism and recreational activities were higher than those of the region with more tourism and recreational activities. Moreover, the seeds germination rates of the two observed plants were significantly different in the same experimental route and place.",

        "abstract": "In order to understand the ecological effect of of tourism development,sample investigation was conducted on the basis of the data obtained from the plant communities and soil properties along the main routes in Huangshan Mountain scenic areas.The impacts of tourist disturbance on plant communities and soil properties were analyzed by comparing the condition of vegetation and soil among the different distances of 0,5,10,15m away from the tourist trail where the intensities of tourist disturbance are distinct.The results are as follows: The impact of tourist disturbance on trees wasn\u2032t obvious,but significant on the seedlings.There was a marked effect on the cover of shrub layer with a decrease tendency towards the main tourist trails.On the herb layer the impact was relatively evident.The height of herb layer near the trail where the intensity of tourist disturbance was the greatest decreased obviously.However,the cover of herb layer has not shown a regular change with increasing intensity of tourist disturbance.Tourist disturbance raised,on the one hand,species diversity in herb layer,and affected the composition of species on the other hand.The impacted spatial area could reach the surrounding area of 10m in diameter near the trail.The most significant ecological stress placed by tourist was on leaf litter layer.With the increase in the intensity of tourist disturbance,the height of leaf litter layer decreased distinctly.The impacted area could range 15m in diameter away from the trail.Soil properties was also influenced obviously by tourist disturbance.The content of organic matter,the total N and the total P in soil decreased with the increasing intensity of tourist disturbance,but the value of pH and the content of total K increased.The impacted range of soil covered an area of about 15m in diameter away from the trail,but the most obviously affected areas were in 5m.",

        "abstract": "In early 1990s, the development of Spatial Economics laid down certain theory foundation for the study of spatiality of economy. Such spatial research is defined as the research of economic spatial pattern in spatial economy to explain the reasons and formation mechanism for phenomenon of spatial agglomeration. Some tools, such as Theil entropy index, relative entropy index, Coefficient of Variation and half-logarithm economic growth model, are utilized to analyze the evolution of the spatial and temporal distribution and the variation of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as well as economic growth effect of FDI in the Pan-Yangtze Delta. The models of spatial pattern of FDI and economic impact of spatial variability for FDI are constructed respectively. A wholly trend of diffusing is found on the spatial distribution of FDI in Pan-Yangtze Delta. The diffusing way is along the \"Z\" shape spool thread, and the diffusing forms include two kinds: one is the contagious proliferation and the other is the hierarchical proliferation. The hierarchical proliferation is more remarkable after 2001. Based on correlated statistical data from 1990 to 2007, variation degree and economic effect of the five provinces and Shanghai city of Pan-Yangtze Delta were worked out. The results showed that FDI have been playing a positive role to the regions economic growth. However, the efficiency is different in different regions. The variation degree of FDI is inverse correlated to economic growth. Based on above findings, three fields should be concerned when making and implementing related policy of FDI. Firstly, trying to create friendly financing environment and further consolidate and enlarge the scale of FDI after world financial crisis. Secondly, establishing expedite FDI spreading corridor and optimizing its special framework. Spatial framework and variation which based on capital efficiency are decided by rent seeking nature of FDI. It is concentrated on Shanghai firstly, and spread to the other provinces. In order to improve the practical efficiency of FDI, open FDI spreading channel should be constructed by every region. Then FDI can be allocated appropriately and effectively used under the market mechanism. Last but not least, the harmony of regional development should be kept to promote national economic revitalization. The blue print of the Pan-Yangtze Delta Area should be designed and even all Yangtze River valleys as soon as possible in the background of harmonious development at the national level.",

Therefore,quantitative study on this topic has important theoretical and practical significance. Methods We used quadrat and transect methods to investigate snow-damaged forest in Jiuhua Mountain,China and analyzed damage to Phyllostachys pubescens in different locations and with different biological characteristics. Important findings Preliminary analysis revealed that the extent of damage on P. pubescens was related to its location:shaded slope > sunny slope and high latitude > low latitude. The damage to P. pubescens was positively correlated to its importance value in the community,that is,pure forest > mixed forest. The average diameter at breast height(DBH) of damaged P. pubescens was(9.8 \u00b1 1.3) cm,and most damage occurred in the juvenile stage. Individuals within 4 m from roads were damaged significantly more than individuals further away(p < 0.05) . We proposed principles for forest management and forestation after snow damage.",

The results indicated that the soil ecosystem and the landscape of the wetland park were destroyed by tourism disturbances. The activities of soil enzymes would decrease according to the increase of tourism disturbances. There were 1 439 individuals of soil macrofauna belonged to 20 orders, 8 classes, and 3 phylums in 80 soil samples. It showed that they decreased according to the increase of tourism disturbances, while the certain edge effect appeared in the place far away from the road. The complexity index was applicable than the of Shannon-Wiener index on representing the complexity and the diversity of soil macrofauna communities under the influence of tourism disturbances. The activities of soil urease and invertase were highly related to the content of soil organic matter, activities of other soil enzymes and the complexity index about soil macrofauna. Therefore, the activities of urease and invertase were possible to predict the soil environment quality of the wetland park. Tourism activities in the core area and the application of non-ecological materials violated the principles and the goals in the construction of the national wetland parks.",

        "abstract": "This paper explored the concept of wetland parks, summarized the current situation of wetland park construction and their causes of formation in China, studied the type classification of wetland parks and compared the distribution patterns of two types of the state-level wetland parks. The result showed that there is a great need for an academically identical definition for wetland parks. The resolution to the problem depended on clear explanation to the four parts of the peculiarity of wetland parks-research objects, development goals, research disciplines and geological regions. We proposed the so-called wetland park, which is the special area and has the ability to keep integrity of wetlands ecosystem. The protective application under suitable ecological design should be guided by the principle of education and popularization of science and the basic methods of application are entertainment and ecotourism. It was primarily the late beginning and such factors as economic development limitation, resource condition, and eco-environment protection consciousness and capability contributed to the low approval threshold, slow construction process, unbalanced regional development, low diversification of building types, and scarcity of monographic study of the state-level wetland parks in China. The state-level wetland parks on the planning stage can obtain approval of construction easily. The reason of no direct investment to construction from related departments caused that they have strove for financial source of construction independently. The result was that recently insufficient investment made construction of some state-level wetland parks staying on planning level. The lag of construction and some influences of economic development level, wetland resource distribution and consciousness and capability of environment protection contributed to unbalanced development of wetland parks in Chinese provinces. The lower consciousness on type classification of wetland resulted in the problems of unbalance between lag of monographic study on wetland parks and high speed of construction caused by travel boom to ecotourism of wetland parks Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the macroscopic control and the guidance of wetland park construction and pay more attention to the quality construction and harmonious regional-development. Type classification played an important role in displaying the diversity of wetland parks, and priority should be given to the construction of different types of wetland parks. We attempted to take some different methods in type classification of wetland parks. At last, we noted that some work should be done in construction of wetland parks- to unify concept and set up proper approval threshold; to regulate regional balance and increase type diversity; to enforce basic research and strengthen international propaganda.",

The scheme is based on a clock counter and an electronic variable delay line, which theoretically can provide unlimited compensation range. We perform successive tests in three optical fiber links of different lengths in which both continuous drifts and abrupt hop of the transmission delay are effectively compensated. The total transmission delay variation induced in the experiments is much larger than most of the reported cases.

A proper ratio of the frequencies of the components is well maintained by parameter m to avoid interference between them. Experimentally, a stable 200 MHz signal is transferred over 100 km optical fiber with the help of a 1 GHz detecting signal, and fractional instability of 2\u00d710<sup>-17</sup> at 10<sup>5</sup>\u2009\u2009s is achieved.",

By performing sub-carrier modulation to the time signal, the time and frequency signals can be directly transferred in the same optical channel without causing mutual interference. The remote user does not need a slave oscillator to clear up the frequency signal and therefore can maintain a simple structure. We test the scheme in the proof-of-concept experiment, in which the 50 MHz modulated time signal and 400 MHz frequency signal are transferred together over 100 km optical fiber link. Good signal compatibility and system performance is observed in the experimental results.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a scheme to achieve point-to-multipoint dissemination of radio frequency (RF) signals in a local area fiber optic network with tree topology based on wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) technique. The phase changes caused by the fluctuations of the transfer links are passively canceled at remote end instead of at local end, which makes it feasible to flexibly build a tree-topology local area dissemination network with great cost-effectiveness. For the first time, we study the limit of long-term performance which is caused by temperature-induced variation of group velocity dispersion (TIVGVD) in dissemination networks using WDM techniques. In the proof-of-concept experiments, 38.5 km and 50 km fiber links are established to disseminate a 1 GHz frequency signal with fractional instability of 10(-17) order after 10(4) s averaging time. Then 17.4 nm wavelength spacing is introduced between local carrier and user carrier to verify the theoretical analysis. Under a controlled fiber temperature variation of about 21 \u00b0C, the obtained overlapping Allan deviation (ADEV) agrees well with the simulation results after 10(4) s time scales, which proves the validity of our theory. The theory has practical values in predicting and optimizing the capacity and performance of a WDM-based local area RF dissemination network.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A kind of photonic low phase-noise frequency-doubling signal generation based on an optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) is demonstrated in this paper. A microwave source drive signal is modulated on the optical signal with the first Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) which is biased at the minimum transmission point (MITP) to eliminate the first-order sidebands and suppress even-order sidebands. The modulated optical signal is sent to the second MZM and the multimode OEO loop which is contributed by the single mode fiber (SMF), photo-detector (PD) and RF amplifier. The frequency-doubling signal is generated by the beating of the two sidebands at a PD. Using the high Q optical comb frequency response to select the oscillation mode of the multimode OEO loop, the system can effectively improve the phase noise performance of the generated frequency-doubling signal. In the experiment, C-band and X-band signal can implement frequency doubling, compared with the microwave drive signal, above 20\u00a0dB phase-noise reduction at 10\u00a0kHz frequency offset from the center frequency is realized. With low cost and simple system, frequency-doubling signal with low phase-noise is realized.",

        "abstract": "We have demonstrated a scheme to realize the generation of frequency-sextupled signals with low phase noise (PN). The structure is based on a multimode optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) and two cascaded Mach\u2013Zehnder modulators (MZMs). A drive source signal is modulated by the MZM1, which is biased at the minimum transmission point (MITP); the generated first-order sidebands are injected into the multimode OEO, which is contributed by the MZM2, the single-mode fiber, the photodetector, and the amplifier. The third-order sidebands are generated by the MZM2, which is also biased at the MITP. The modulated signal is then divided into reflection components and transmission components by a fiber Bragg grating (FBG). The reflection components, including the first-order sidebands, are sent to the photodetector and fed back to the MZM2 to form an optoelectronic hybrid loop. The transmission components, including the third-order sidebands, are heterodyned by another photodetector to generate a frequency-sextupled signal. Compared with the drive signal, the generated signal has a lower PN due to the selection of the oscillation mode. In the experiment, a frequency-sextupled signal from 15 to 24 GHz is generated by a drive signal, which is tuned from 2.5 to 4 GHz. The PN of the generated signal at 24 GHz is \u2212103.6 dBc/Hz@10 kHz; 14.6 dB PN reduction is realized.",

A portion of master oscillation signal is injected into the slave OEO loop, then it is locked by OEO signal after it passes through a long optical delay line with high Q value. With the RF isolator, the master oscillation signal with poor phase-noise is avoided directly mixing in the OEO signal. With the configuration a tunable range from 1.93 to 17.69\u00a0GHz with 68\u00a0dB suppression of the nearest-neighbor spur is realized. The single-sideband phase noise is below \u2212112\u00a0dBc/Hz at an offset of 10\u00a0kHz within the whole tunable range. The frequency drift of the OEO system is",

Tin-doped MoS2 (Sn/MoS2) flowers have been synthesized by a solvothermal method followed with annealing in Ar(H2) atmosphere, with SnO2-MoO3, thioacetamide (TAA), and urea as starting materials. The doping and the content of Sn-doping play crucial roles in the morphology and electrochemical performance of the MoS2. As anode materials for lithium ion battery (LIB), all Sn/MoS2 composites exhibit both higher reversible capacity and better cycling performance at current density of 200 mA g\u22121, compared with MoS2 without Sn doping. The achieved discharge capacity for Sn/MoS2 composites is above 1000 mAh g\u22121 after 100 cycles with nearly 100% coulombic efficiency. The doping of metal Sn in MoS2 can improve the conductivity of MoS2 and significantly enhance its electrochemical properties. The good electrochemical performance suggests that the Sn/MoS2 composite could be a promising candidate as a novel anode material for LIB application. Our present work provides a new approach to the fabrication of anode materials for LIB applications.",

The effects of annealing time on the morphologies and electrochemical properties of the final products were systematically investigated. The porous Mn2O\u2083 microspheres prepared at 600 \u00b0C for 4 h exhibit the best electrochemical properties with a high reversible capability (925 mAh/g at current density of 100 mA/g) and cycling stability. It still retains a high capacity of 565 mAh/g, even after 100 cycles, as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. The good electrochemical performance for the porous Mn\u2082O\u2083microspheres can be attributed to its high surface area and mesoporous structure.",

        "abstract": "Mixed-valence oxide precursors were synthesized by a solvothermal method using NiSO, CoSO, and NHHCO as raw materials. The precursors were heat-treated in a muffle furnace at 500\u00a0\u00b0C to obtain the products (NiCoO). The samples were characterized by X-ray diffractometer, thermogravimetric, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The results show that dumbbells, microspheres, and particle-like NiCoO were successfully synthesized by changing the volume of solvent and solvothermal temperature. The NiCoO microspheres (prepared at 180\u00a0\u00b0C with 30\u00a0ml solvent) as anode material for lithium-ion battery, exhibit a reversible discharge capacity of 1160\u00a0mAh\u00a0g and good cycling stability (729\u00a0mAh\u00a0g after 50 cycles) at a constant current of 100\u00a0mA\u00a0g in the voltage range of 0.01\u20133.0\u00a0V due to its high crystallinity and uniform porous morphology. Hence, the synthetic method could be extended to other high-capacity ternary metal oxide materials for lithium-ion battery application.",

More importantly, biosensors based on taste cells, tissues, nerves and enzyme as the sensing elements have been developed, and nanotechnology and microfluidic chip have been utilized for the fabrication of biosensors. There are two main aspects of practical application for five basic tastes via biomimetic sensors and biosensors: one aspect is to clarify taste sensation and transduction mechanism; another aspect is to obtain taste sensing information of food and pharmaceutical. The future perspectives for improvement of biomimetic sensors or biosensors are discussed.",

In this paper, a novel tandem evaluation approach, which is grade classification model tandem back propagationartion neural network (BpNN) method, was developed for multi-metal sensor to predict rice eating quality. Characteristic current and potential arrays were extracted and properly processed, resulting in potential phasor plane values and current phasor plane values. The current phasor plane values were used as the input variables of grade classification model, and consequently, the classification value and grade value of sample output as well as potential phasor plane values were used in the following BpNN for score prediction. It was found that the performance of developed grade classification model tandem BpNN method was better than that of direct neural network method. The scores predicted by developed method were compared to sensory scores obtained by traditional sensory evaluation. A correlation coefficient of 0.9964, a RMSE of 0.69, a slop of 0.98 and an intercept of 1.45 were obtained. The accuracy of developed method for score prediction was 90%. Results indicated that the developed tandem evaluation approach was an efficient method for rice score prediction in electronic tongue system.",

        "abstract": "One hundred twenty indica rice samples were determined by electronic tongue and electronic nose. The potential of the combinational approaches of electronic tongue and nose for rice analysis, with the aim of differentiating conventional and hybrid rice, was investigated. Principal component analysis (PCA) and locally linear embedding (LLE) were used to preprocess data from electronic systems. Support vector machine (SVM) model and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) model were established with the values from PCA and LLE algorithms as attributes. For the combination of electronic tongue and nose, the prediction accuracies of PCA-SVM, PCA-KNN, LLE-SVM, and LLE-KNN models were 55, 55, 85, and 80\u00a0%. The LLE-based models achieved better prediction accuracies than PCA-based models. These results demonstrated that LLE algorithm coupled with SVM or KNN for the combined electronic signals was effective in extracting and analyzing features for detecting rice. The LLE-SVM model achieved a little higher accuracy than the LLE-KNN model. It can be concluded that the combination of electronic systems coupled with LLE-based model have a great potential in the prediction of rice types.",

        "abstract": "The effect of germination and parboiling treatment on distribution of water molecular, physicochemical profiles and microstructure of rice was investigated. The results showed that the water molecular was evenly distributed in rice kernel after germination, but after subjecting to parboiling treatment, mobile water molecular might be confined to small region, which diffused from the outer regions into the rice kernel core. The reason may be that parboiling treatment produced macromolecular matrix where dispersed amylose chains form double-helical associations between starch granules so that water molecular is restrained and not entrapped within the starch crystallites. Meanwhile, the changes of microstructure and distribution of water molecular may be attributed to softness of germinated rice and hardness of parboiling rice. In addition, parboiling treatment had significant (p u003c 0.05) effect on the physicochemical properties of germinated rice. The viscosity and pasting temperature significantly (p u003c 0.05) increased. The storage modulus (G\u2032), loss modulus (G\u2032\u2032), tan \u03b4 and shear stress had lower value compared to untreated germinated rice. Colour difference significantly (p u003c 0.05) increased, the microstructure of surface became smoother and compacter.",

        "abstract": "Dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccine strategies aimed at targeting cancer stem\u2013like cells (CSC) may be most efficacious if deployed in the adjuvant setting. In this study, we offer preclinical evidence that this is the case for a CSC-DC vaccine as tested in murine models of SCC7 squamous cell cancer and D5 melanoma. Vaccination of mice with an ALDH high  SCC7 CSC-DC vaccine after surgical excision of established SCC7 tumors reduced local tumor relapse and prolonged host survival. This effect was augmented significantly by simultaneous administration of anti-PD-L1, an immune checkpoint inhibitor. In the minimal disease setting of D5 melanoma, treatment of mice with ALDH high  CSC-DC vaccination inhibited primary tumor growth, reduced spontaneous lung metastases, and increased host survival. In this setting, CCR10 and its ligands were downregulated on ALDH high  D5 CSCs and in lung tissues, respectively, after vaccination with ALDH high  D5 CSC-DC. RNAi-mediated attenuation of CCR10 blocked tumor cell migration  in vitro  and metastasis  in vivo . T cells harvested from mice vaccinated with ALDH high  D5 CSC-DC selectively killed ALDH high  D5 CSCs, with additional evidence of humoral immunologic engagement and a reduction in ALDH high  cells in residual tumors. Overall, our results offered a preclinical proof of concept for the use of ALDH high  CSC-DC vaccines in the adjuvant setting to more effectively limit local tumor recurrence and spontaneous pulmonary metastasis, as compared with traditional DC vaccines, with increased host survival further accentuated by simultaneous PD-L1 blockade.

        "abstract": "With the application of a potential of -0.8V, CuInS2 thin film was electrodeposited on stainless steel substrate by one step method in sulfurate bath, consisting of 10mM CuSO4\u00b75H2O, 10mM In2(SO4)3 and 200mM Na2S2O3 with the pH value of 2.0. The influence of bath aging conditions, deposition time and the heat treatment on the morphology, stoichiometric proportion and structure of the film were studied by scanning electronic microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Also, the photoelectric performance of the as-received film was characterized by electrochemical approach and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer. A highly (112)-oriented chalcopyrite structure was achieved in as-deposited samples. It was proved that there existed a critical bath aging time of 10.5h, an optimal deposition time of 40min at 50\u00b0C and an annealing temperature of 400\u00b0C, which were favorable to produce a chalcopyrite thin film. Based on the Mott-Schottky curve, the flat band potential of 0.89V and the acceptor density of 1.01\u00d71019cm-3 were obtained. The band gap of the as-deposited film was determined with the value of about 1.50eV. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Selective laser melting (SLM) is one of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies used for directly fabricating 3D metal parts with complex shapes. However, the residual stress and the resultant deformation issues lead to the distortion and failure of SLM fabricated parts and impede the further application of this technology. In this research, a combination of the finite element simulation and experimental verification is proposed to study the effect of scanning strategies on the thermal behavior and residual stress distribution. Two kinds of mechanical boundary conditions are selected to investigate its effect on the residual stress in the mechanical simulation. The transient thermal simulation results demonstrate that the scanning strategies take a great influence on temperature field, however, molten pool size is hardly affected by the scanning strategies. In terms of residual stress simulation, 15\u00b0 rotate scan strategy generates the smallest stress among the all scan strategies studied in this research. This conclusion is confirmed by experimental results. In addition, although there is still a difference between the numerical simulation and experimental result, mechanical simulation gives satisfactory residual stress trend compared with experiments.",

Results showed that there were more voids with faster scanning speeds, and there were oxide powder and non-melt silicon inside the defects. The SLM 316L exhibited a full gamma austenite phase filled with sub-grains, and the average grain size of SLM-1083\u00a0mm/s 316L was approximately 42\u00a0\u03bcm, three times larger than that of the quenched 316L. The pitting potentials for the SLM 316L were all approximately 300\u00a0mV higher than that of the quenched due to the modification of inclusions in SLM, but the corrosion rate for the SLM 316L was faster, which was attributed to the voids and unstable passive film. The number of pitting sites increased with the scanning speed, and the pits occurred preferentially at the voids in SLM 316L.",

The cellular prior \u03b2 grains were formed on XY plane. However, the columnar morphology of prior \u03b2 grains were formed on the XZ and YZ planes, which showed an epitaxial growth along the building direction through successive deposited layers. All the planes displayed the fine acicular \u03b1\u2032 martensites formed due to the significantly rapid cooling rate of melt pool. The reason for forming the intersection angular of 40\u00b0-50\u00b0 between acicular \u03b1\u2032 and \u03b2 boundaries was clarified. The improved tensile strength of 1261\u202fMPa and good ductility with elongation of 10.2% were simultaneous obtained for SLM-processed Ti6Al4V part. The present work provides a fundamental understanding of rapid manufacturing of high-strength and light-weight structural materials by laser additive manufacturing.",

        "abstract": "The corrosion behavior and mechanical properties of 316L stainless steel (SS) fabricated via selective laser melting (SLM) were clarified by potentiodynamic polarization measurements, immersion tests, and tensile experiments. The microstructural anisotropy of SLMed 316L SS was also investigated by electron back-scattered diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The grain sizes of the SLMed 316L SS in the XOZ plane were smaller than those of the SLMed 316L SS in the XOY plane, and a greater number of low-angle boundaries were present in the XOY plane, resulting in lower elongation for the XOY plane than for the XOZ plane. The SLMed 316L was expected to exhibit higher strength but lower ductility than the wrought 316L, which was attributed to the high density of dislocations. The pitting potentials of the SLMed 316L samples were universally higher than those of the wrought sample in chloride solutions because of the annihilation of MnS or (Ca,Al)-oxides during the rapid solidification. However, the molten pool boundaries preferentially dissolved in aggressive solutions and the damage of the SLMed 316L in FeCl3 solution was more serious after long-term service, indicating poor durability.",

        "abstract": "NKTR-181, a new molecular entity, full mu-opioid receptor agonist with an inherently slow rate of CNS entry, was designed to provide analgesia while reducing abuse potential. The objective of this phase 3, enriched-enrollment, randomized-withdrawal trial was to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, safety, and tolerability of NKTR-181 in patients with chronic low-back pain (CLBP). Adults with moderate-to-severe CLBP refractory to non-opioid analgesics achieving an analgesic NKTR-181 dosage (100-400 mg twice daily) during the open-label titration period were randomized to continued NKTR-181 treatment, double-blind, or switched to placebo. The study was conducted at 55 sites in the United States. Of 1189 patients exposed to NKTR-181 during the titration period, 610 were randomized to NKTR-181 100-400 mg every 12 hours or placebo for 12-weeks. The primary outcome measure was the change in weekly pain score (scale, 0-10) at 12-weeks from randomization baseline. Secondary outcome measures included responder rates defined by \u226530% and \u226550% improvement in pain score from screening to 12 weeks. Among 610 randomized patients, the mean pain score decreased from 6.73 to 2.32 during open-label titration. After randomization, the least-squares mean change in pain score was +0.92 for NKTR-181 vs. +1.46 for placebo (P=0.002). The \u226530%-improvement responder rate of NKTR-181 vs. Placebo was 71.2% vs. 57.1% (P<0.001), and the \u226550%-improvement responder rate was 51.1% vs. 37.9% (P=0.001). NKTR-181 was well tolerated with a low incidence (<3%) of CNS-related AEs during the randomized treatment phase. In patients with moderate-to-severe CLBP, NKTR-181 demonstrated significant analgesic efficacy and a favorable safety/tolerability profile, with a low incidence of CNS AEs.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND) , where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

        "abstract": "The microalga Porphyridium purpureum within Rhodophyta abundantly produces several valuable proteins, polysaccharides, pigments and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid; it is especially effective in accumulating arachidonic acid (ARA). However, this high ARA yield is always achieved in conditions unfavourable for cell growth. In this study, we present a method for obtaining desirable ARA levels from P. purpureum while simultaneously promoting cell growth using appropriate concentrations of the growth hormone 5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA).Both the biomass and the ARA content of P. purpureum were enhanced by stimulation with 20 mg/L 5-ALA, leading to an optimal ARA yield of 170.32 mg/L-a 70.82% increase compared with control conditions. This ARA yield is the highest ever reported for microalgae. Based on variations in the fatty acid composition, total lipids, total proteins, total carbohydrates and pigment content during the cultivation period, we propose that the accumulation of ARA stimulated by 5-ALA occurs at the expense of other UFAs and total proteins, which may be related to decreased zeaxanthin. Lipidomic analysis revealed that triacylglycerols (TAGs) accounted for 47.5 \u00b1 3.6% of all detected lipids, followed by phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG). As the levels of the most abundant TAGs increased under 5-ALA promotion and because 78.1 \u00b1 3.4% (by weight) of detected TAG-branched chains contained ARA, the increase of ARA was mainly caused by TAG accumulation.This work demonstrated a simple and effective strategy to promote both biomass and ARA yield in P. purpureum by introducing a small amount of 5-ALA. These results are helpful for understanding the microalgae metabolic pathways affected by phytohormones and for guiding the development of bioproducts from microalgae.",

        "abstract": "Lignocellulosic biomass, a matrix of the biopolymers including cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, has gathered increasing attention in recent years in the production of chemicals, fuels and materials based on biorefinery processes due to its renewability and availability. Fractionating lignocellulose is considered as the foundational step to establish an economical and sustainable lignocellulosic biorefinery. This Minireview summarized a newly developed oxygen delignification for lignocellulose fractionation called cooking with active oxygen and solid alkali (CAOSA), which could fractionate lignocellulose into its constituents while remaining in processable form. In the CAOSA approach, environmentally-friendly chemicals were applied instead of undesirable chemicals including strong alkalis and sulfides. Notably, the alkali recovery for this process promised to be relatively simple, neither causticizing nor sintering. These features made the CAOSA process an alternative for both lignocellulose fractionation and biomass pretreatment. Advantages and challenges have also been discussed in order to provide a comprehensive perspective with respect to existing strategies.",

        "abstract": "Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are highly appreciated on their nutritive value for human health and aquaculture. P. purpureum, one of the red microalgae acknowledged as a promising accumulator of ARA, was chosen as the target algae in the present research. Effects of sodium bicarbonate (0.04-1.2 g/L), temperature (25, 30 and 33 \u00b0C) and phosphate (0.00-0.14 g/L) on biomass yield, total fatty acids (TFA) and arachidonic acid (ARA) accumulation were investigated systemically. NaHCO3 dose of 0.8 g/L and moderate temperature of 30 \u00b0C were preferred. In addition, TFA and ARA production were significantly enhanced by an appropriate concentration of phosphate, and the highest TFA yield of 666.38 mg/L and ARA yield of 159.74 mg/L were obtained at a phosphate concentration of 0.035 g/L. Interestingly, with phosphate concentration continuing to fall, UFA/TFA and ARA/EPA ratios were increased accordingly, suggesting that phosphate limitation promoted unsaturated fatty acids and arachidonic acid biosynthesis. Low concentration of phosphate may be favored to increase the enzymatic activities of \u22066-desaturase, which played a key role in catalyzing the conversion of C16:0 to C18:2, and thus the selectivity of UFA increased. Meanwhile, the increase of ARA selectivity could be attributed to \u03c96 pathway promotion and \u220617-desaturase activity inhibition with phosphate limitation. Phosphate limitation strategy enhanced unsaturated fatty acids and ARA biosynthesis in P. purpureum, and can be applied in commercial scale manufacturing and commercialization of ARA.",

        "abstract": "Bats are connected with the increasing numbers of emerging and re-emerging viruses that may break the species barrier and spread into the human population. Coronaviruses are one of the most common viruses discovered in bats, which were considered as the natural source of recent human-susceptible coronaviruses, i.e. SARS-COV and MERS-CoV. Our previous study reported the discovery of a bat-derived putative cross-family recombinant coronavirus with a reovirus gene p10, named as Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1. In this report, through a two-year follow-up of a special bat population in one specific cave of south China, we illustrate that Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 persistently circulates among bats. Notably, through the longitudinal observation, we identified the dynamic evolution of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 in bats represented by continuously recombination events. Our study provides the first glimpse of the virus evolution in one longitudinally observed bat population cohort and underlines the surveillance and pre-warning of potential interspecies transmittable viruses in bats.",

Herein, we identified a novel coronavirus, provisionally designated Rousettus bat coronavirus GCCDC1 (Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1), in the rectal swab samples of Rousettus leschenaulti bats by using pan-coronavirus RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Although the virus is similar to Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9 (Ro-BatCoV HKU9) in genome characteristics, it is sufficiently distinct to be classified as a new species according to the criteria defined by the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). More striking was that Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 contained a unique gene integrated into the 3'-end of the genome that has no homologs in any known coronavirus, but which sequence and phylogeny analyses indicated most likely originated from the p10 gene of a bat orthoreovirus. Subgenomic mRNA and cellular-level observations demonstrated that the p10 gene is functional and induces the formation of cell syncytia. Therefore, here we report a putative heterologous inter-family recombination event between a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus and a double-stranded segmented RNA virus, providing insights into the fundamental mechanisms of viral evolution.",

        "abstract": "Constant surveillance of live poultry markets (LPMs) is currently the best way to predict and identify emerging avian influenza viruses (AIVs) that pose a potential threat to public health. Through surveillance of LPMs from 16 provinces and municipalities in China during 2014-2016, we identified 3,174 AIV-positive samples and isolated and sequenced 1,135 AIVs covering 31 subtypes. Our analysis shows that H5N6 has replaced H5N1 as one of the dominant AIV subtypes in southern China, especially in ducks. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that H5N6 arose from reassortments of H5 and H6N6 viruses, with the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase combinations being strongly lineage specific. H5N6 viruses constitute at\u00a0least 34 distinct genotypes derived from various evolutionary pathways. Notably, genotype G1.2 virus, with internal genes from the chicken H9N2/H7N9 gene pool, was responsible for at least five human H5N6 infections. Our findings highlight H5N6 AIVs as potential threats to public health and agriculture.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   There is a rapidly increasing interest in new energy battery chemistries, particularly with respect to conducting polymers and especially with a focus on alternative systems to lithium and lithium ion. Herein we present a novel conducting polymer, poly(aniline- co -azure B) (PANAB), synthesized by introducing redox-active azure B into the polyaniline backbone through co-electropolymerization. The resultant PANAB possesses an electrochemical activity over a larger pH range as compared to polyaniline, and can thereby be used as a cathode-active material for a rechargeable aqueous Zn-polymer battery. This battery features large discharge specific capacities of 134.0 and 127.8\u00a0mA\u00a0h\u00a0g \u22121  at 120 and 1000\u00a0mA\u00a0g \u22121 , respectively, while maintaining good cycling performance. The co-electropolymerization strategy provides a route for the synthesis of more conducting polymers with organic redox-active groups for rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors and fuel cells.",

The structured grid and SST k\u2013\u03c9 turbulence model have been applied. The numerical simulations of open water performance of marine propeller E779A are carried out with different advance ratios to verify the numerical simulation method. Results show that the thrust and the torque are in good agreements with experimental data. The grid independent inspection is applied to verify accuracy of numerical simulation grid. The numerical predictions of hydrodynamic performance of pumpjet propulsor are carried out with different advance ratios. Results indicate that the rotor provides the main thrust of propulsor and the balance performance of propulsor is generally satisfactory. Additionally, the curve of propulsor efficiency is in good agreement with experimental data. Furthermore, the pressure distributions around rotor and stator blades are reasonable. Beyond that, the existence of tip clearance accounts for the appearance of tip vortex that leads to a further loss in efficiency and a probability of cavitation phenomenon.",

The numerical investigation of cavitating flow of marine propeller E779A was carried out with different advance ratios and cavitation numbers to verify the numerical simulation method. Tip clearance effects on the performance of pumpjet propulsor had been investigated. Results showed that the structure and characteristics of the tip leakage vortex and the efficiency of the propulsor dropped more sharply with the increase of the tip clearance size. Furthermore, the numerical simulation of tip clearance cavitation of pumpjet propulsor had been presented with different rotational speed and tip clearance size. The mechanism of tip clearance cavitation causing a further loss of the efficiency had been studied. The influence of rotational speed and tip clearance size on tip clearance cavitation had been investigated.",

The results show that the fine, dense and coherent MC and M2C secondary carbides can be precipitated on the internal twin boundaries of the martensite plates and within the plates during tempering at 560\u2013600 \u00b0C. Ten layers of (112\u00af0)M2C stacking along (200)\u03b1 during triple tempering at 580 \u00b0C comprise the needle-like M2C precipitates with ~ 1.5 nm thickness. Increasing the tempering temperature can promote the coarsening of M2C precipitates as well as their sparse distribution. Under same tempering conditions, the superior tempering resistance of 2% Nb alloyed steel is made by high-density M2C nanoparticles. It is found that the lack of Mo in primary M6C and MC carbides induced by 2% Nb addition can promote a larger number of Mo atoms to be dissolved into the matrix, and the increased Mo not only prevents the agglomeration of nano M2C particles but also delay the generation of M3C during aging process.",

        "abstract": "Hot deformation behavior of a new type of M3 : 2 high speed steel with niobium addition made by spray forming was investigated based on compression tests in the temperature range of 950\u20131150 \u00b0C and strain rate of 0.001\u201310 s\u22121. A comprehensive constitutive equation was obtained, which could be used to predict the flow stress at different strains. Processing map was developed on the basis of the flow stress data using the principles of dynamic material model. The results showed that the flow curves were in fair agreement with the dynamic recrystallization model. The flow stresses, which were calculated by the comprehensive constitutive equation, agreed well with the test data at low strain rates (\u2a7d1 s\u22121). The material constant (\u03b1), stress exponent (n) and the hot deformation activation energy (QHW) of the new steel were 0.00615 MPa\u22121 4.81 and 546 kJ \u2022 mol\u22121 respectively. Analysis of the processing map with an observation of microstructures revealed that hot working processes of the steel could be carried out safely in the domain (T = 1050\u20131150 \u00b0C, \u03b5\u0307 = 0.01\u20130.1 s\u22121 ) with about 33% peak efficiency of power dissipation (\u03b7). Cracks was expected in two domains at either lower temperatures (<1000 \u00b0C) or low strain rates (0.001 s\u22121 ) with different cracking mechanisms. Flow localization occurred when the strain rates exceeded 1 s\u22121 at all testing temperatures.",

Processing maps were developed according to the principles of Dynamic Material Model. It was found that the flow curves assumed the classic shape of dynamic recrystallization(DRX)-rising to a peak, following a softening to a steady state. The hot working process of the steel can be carried out safely in the domain of(Td: 1050-1150\u2103, e: 0.01-0.1 s-1). To obtain microstructures of the steel with fine grains and uniform distribution of fine granular carbides, the hot working process should be carried out at 1150\u2103 and strain rate of 0.1 s-1. The flow instability took place when strain rates exceed 1 s-1. After a proper hot working and heat treatment, the hardness and bending strength of the spray-formed Nb-containing M3:2 high speed steel is 67 HRC and 3467 MPa, respectively.",

        "abstract": "The SerpinE2 pathway is evolutionarily conserved and plays an important role in tumorigenesis. SerpinE2 (a small ubiquitin-related modifier), like ubiquitin, conjugates SerpinE2 proteins onto lysine residues of target proteins. SerpinE2 over-expression has been found in several tumors. Here, we detected the level of SerpinE2 in 72 samples of EC tissue using immunohistochemistry to assess the role of SerpinE2 in EC prognosis. Meanwhile, we knocked down SerpinE2 by siRNA in the HTB-111 and Ishikawa EC cell lines and analyzed the viability and mobility change using an MTT assay, an annexin V/PI apoptosis assay, a wound scratch test and a transwell assay. A Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated a negative correlation between the level of SerpinE2 and the EC prognosis. Silencing SerpinE2 induced cell apoptosis and reduced the migration ability. Our data suggest SerpinE2 works as an oncogene in EC.",

The research was conducted based on the in-depth interviewing of 15 samples, open-consultation and the analysis of secondhand data. The integration models of tourism labor migrants in the Jiuhua Mountain were formed through four processes including theoretic sampling, coding-analysis, cross-tabulation and contextualization. The result shows that modes of production and life styles decide self-integration orientation of tourism labor migrants in the Jiuhua Mountain. Cultural differences are fundamental dissimilarity between tourism labor migrants and natives. There are three kinds of integration models including rapid, free and gradually advancing integration. The differences among different types of migrants' integration models are remarkable. Taking the working integration as the abscissa and taking the life integration as the coordinate, an \"S\" model of integration matrix appears in the gradually advancing integration of intermediate and high administers from the working to the life which should be paid special attention to.",

Excess Mg in MgxB2+10\u2002wt\u2009%\u2002SiC composites effectively improves the connectivity, as evidenced by both the resistivity properties and the Raman scattering. The promising Jc(H) of Mg1.15B2+10\u2002wt\u2009%\u2002SiC is attributed to both the high connectivity and the improved irreversibility field, Hirr, which is in agreement with the Raman fitting analysis.

By applying a new Lyapunov function method, we prove that the neural network which has a unique almost periodic solution is globally exponentially stable. Moreover, the theoretical findings of this paper on the almost periodic solution are applied to prove the existence and stability of periodic solution for memristor-based shunting inhibitory cellular neural networks with leakage delays and periodic coefficients. An example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. The results obtained in this paper are completely new and complement the previously known studies of Wu (2011) and Chen and Cao (2002).",

        "abstract": "Purpose  This work presents the application of a machine learning (ML) algorithm to automatically generate high-quality, prostate low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy treatment plans. The ML algorithm can mimic characteristics of preoperative treatment plans deemed clinically acceptable by brachytherapists. The planning efficiency, dosimetry, and quality (as assessed by experts) of preoperative plans generated with an ML planning approach was retrospectively evaluated in this study.    Methods and Materials  Preimplantation and postimplantation treatment plans were extracted from 100 high-quality LDR treatments and stored within a training database. The ML training algorithm matches similar features from a new LDR case to those within the training database to rapidly obtain an initial seed distribution; plans were then further fine-tuned using stochastic optimization. Preimplantation treatment plans\u00a0generated by the ML algorithm were compared with brachytherapist (BT) treatment plans in terms of planning time (Wilcoxon rank sum, \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.05) and dosimetry (1-way analysis of variance, \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Qualitative preimplantation plan quality was evaluated by expert LDR radiation oncologists using a Likert scale questionnaire.    Results  The average planning time for the ML approach was 0.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.57\u00a0minutes, compared with 17.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.76\u00a0minutes for the expert planner ( P =.020). Preimplantation plans were dosimetrically equivalent to the BT plans; the average prostate V150% was 4% lower for ML plans ( P =.002), although the difference was not clinically significant. Respondents ranked the ML-generated plans as equivalent to expert BT treatment plans in terms of target coverage, normal tissue avoidance, implant confidence, and the need for plan modifications. Respondents had difficulty differentiating between plans generated by a human or those generated by the ML algorithm.    Conclusions  Prostate LDR preimplantation treatment plans that have equivalent quality to plans created by brachytherapists can be rapidly generated using ML. The adoption of ML in the brachytherapy workflow is expected to improve LDR treatment plan uniformity while reducing planning time and resources.",

        "abstract": "Experimental research shows that the nitric oxides (NOX) concentration track at the outlet of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst with a transient variation of Adblue dosage has a time delay and it features a characteristic of resistance-capacitance (RC). The phenomenon brings obstacles to get the simultaneously NOX expected to be reduced and equi-molar ammonia available to SCR reaction, which finally inhibits NOX conversion efficiency. Generally, engine loads change frequently, which triggers a rapid changing of Adblue dosage, and it aggravates the air quality that are caused by NOX emission and ammonia slip. In order to increase the conversion efficiency of NOX and avoid secondary pollution, the paper gives a comprehensive analysis of the SCR system and tells readers the key factors that affect time delay and RC characteristics. Accordingly, a map of time delay is established and a solution method for time constant and proportional constant is carried out. Finally, the paper accurately describes the input-output state relation of SCR system by using variable RC model with time delay. The model can be used for a real-time correction of Adblue dosage, which can increase the conversion efficiency of NOX in SCR system and avoid secondary pollution forming. Obviously, the results of the work discover an avenue for the SCR control strategy.",

Various studies examining the relationship between nestin expression with the clinical outcome in glioma patients have yielded inconclusive results. Thus, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the association of nestin with prognosis and clinicopathological features of glioma patients. The electronic searches were performed through the database of PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and CNKI. In total, this meta-analysis included 14 studies covering 897 nestin + cases and 704 controls. The correlation between nestin expression and clinicopathological or prognostic parameters was evaluated by Stata 11.0 software. Our results showed that nestin protein abundance was significantly correlated with the histological grade [odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20094.36, 95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20092.14\u20138.88, P\u2009=\u20090.003] of glioma. With respect to prognosis, nestin expression was positively correlated with overall survival (OS) [hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20091.98, 95\u00a0% CI\u2009=\u20091.30\u20133.02, P\u2009=\u20090.000] and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR\u2009=\u20091.90, 95\u00a0% CI\u2009=\u20091.18\u20133.07, P\u2009=\u20090.040). The further stratified analysis not only defined the predictive function of nestin in different ages but also revealed that different antibodies did not alter the positive outcomes and higher standard cutoff values were more suitable for the accurate assay of nestin. Taken together, our results indicate that nestin may play an important role in the prediction of the clinicopathology and poor prognosis of glioma patients. This study should be taken into consideration in the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic programs.",

        "abstract": "AbstractResearch has focused on the significance of social presence in online learning. However, peer interaction does not always result in positive emotions and feelings; it can trigger tension, distress, and anger within a learning community. Therefore, conflictual presence, as a carrier of negative valence within presence, is also a critical element when it becomes inimical to online discussions. Drawing upon the socially situated identity theory and using discourse analysis, this study presents an authentic case where conflictual presence, social presence, and identity negotiation were intertwined throughout the entire life of an online learning community. Findings reveal that students craft their discourses to fashion themselves as a certain kind of facilitator and participant. Implicit and explicit identity negotiation is ubiquitous in discursive interactions and can lead to tension and conflictual socio-relations at times.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Structured tasks and peer-moderated discussions are pedagogical models that have shown unique benefits for online collaborative learning. Students appointed with leadership roles are able to positively affect the dynamics in their groups by engaging with participants, raising questions, and advancing problem solving. To help monitoring and controlling the latent social dynamics associated with leadership behavior, we propose a methodological approach that makes use of computational techniques to mine the content of online communications and analyze group structure to identify students who behave as leaders. Through text mining and social network analysis, we systematically process the discussion posts made by students from four sections of an online course in an American university. The results allow us to quantify each individualu0027s contribution and summarize their engagement in the form of a leadership index. The proposed methodology, when compared to judgements made by experts who manually coded samples of the data, is shown to have comparable performances, but, being fully automated, has the potential to be easily replicable. The summary offered by the leadership index is intended as actionable information that can guide just-in-time interventions together with other tools based on learning analytics.",

This paper presents results of a survey of U.S. manufacturing workers for the: prevalence of fatigue, its root causes and significant factors, and adopted individual fatigue coping methods. The responses from 451 manufacturing employees were analyzed using descriptive data analysis, bivariate analysis and Market Basket Analysis. 57.9% of respondents indicated that they were somewhat fatigued during the past week. They reported the ankles/feet, lower back and eyes were frequently affected body parts and a lack of sleep, work stress and shift schedule were top selected root causes for fatigue. In order to respond to fatigue when it is present, respondents reported coping by drinking caffeinated drinks, stretching/doing exercises and talking with coworkers. Frequent combinations of fatigue causes and individual coping methods were identified. These results may inform the design of fatigue monitoring and mitigation strategies and future research related to fatigue development.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   With the ubiquity of the Internet, platforms such as: Google, Wikipedia and the like can provide insights pertaining to firms\u2019 financial performance as well as capture the collective interest of traders through search trends, number of web page visitors and/or financial news sentiment. Information emanating from these platforms can significantly affect, or be affected by, changes in the stock market. The overarching goal of this paper is to develop a financial expert system that incorporates these features to predict short term stock prices. Our expert system is comprised of two main modules: a knowledge base and an artificial intelligence (AI) platform. The \u201cknowledge base\u201d for our expert system captures: (a) historical stock prices; (b) several well-known technical indicators; (c) counts and sentiment scores of published news articles for a given stock; (d) trends in Google searches for the given stock ticker; and (e) number of unique visitors for pertinent Wikipedia pages. Once the data is collected, we use a structured approach for data preparation. Then, the AI platform trains four machine learning ensemble methods: (a) a neural network regression ensemble; (b) a support vector regression ensemble; (c) a boosted regression tree; and (d) a random forest regression. In the cross-validation phase, the AI platform picks the \u201cbest\u201d ensemble for a given stock. To evaluate the efficacy of our expert system, we first present a case study based on the Citi Group stock ($C) with data collected from 01/01/2013 - 12/31/2016. We show the expert system can predict the 1-day ahead $C stock price with a mean absolute percent error (MAPE) \u202f\u2264\u202f 1.50% and the 1\u201310 day ahead with a MAPE \u202f\u2264\u202f 1.89%, which is better than the reported results in the literature. We show that the use of features extracted from online sources does not substitute the traditional financial metrics, but rather supplements them to improve upon the prediction performance of machine learning based methods. To highlight the utility and generalizability of our expert system, we predict the 1-day ahead price of 19 additional stocks from different industries, volatilities and growth patterns. We report an overall mean for the MAPE statistic of 1.07% across our five different machine learning models, including a MAPE of under 0.75% for 18 of the 19 stocks for the best ensemble (boosted regression tree).",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This paper proposes a two-stage approach that can be used to investigate whether the information hidden in macroeconomic variables (alone) can be used to accurately predict the one-month ahead price for major U.S stock and sector indices. Stage 1 is constructed to evaluate the hypothesis that the price for different indices is driven by different economic indicators. It consists of three phases. In phase I, the data is automatically acquired using freely available APIs (application programming interfaces) and prepared for analysis. Phase II reduces the set of potential predictors without the loss of information through several variable selection methods. The third phase employs four ensemble models and three time-series models for prediction. The prediction performance of the seven models are compared using the Mean Absolute Percent Error (and two additional metrics). If the hypothesis were to be true, one expects that the performance of the ensemble models to outperform the time-series models since the information in the economy is more important than the information in previous prices. In Stage 2, a hybrid approach of the recurring neural network used for time-series prediction (i.e., the LSTM) and the ensemble models is constructed to examine the secondary hypothesis that the residuals from the time-series models are not random and can be explained by the macroeconomic indicators. To test the two hypotheses, the monthly closing prices for 13 U.S. stock and sector indices and the corresponding values for 23 macroeconomic indicators were collected from 01/1992\u201310/2016. Based on the case study, the four ensembles prediction performance were superior to that of the three time-series models. The MAPE of the best model for a given index was",

Global metabolomic analysis in the present study revealed multiple metabolic pathways altered by spexin intraperitoneal (.) injection in rat serum, which are highlighted by the changes in several bile acid metabolites. In rats, spexin (300 \u03bcg/kg) could dramatically reduce hepatic and circulating total bile acids (TBA) level compared with the controls. Correspondingly, treatment with spexin by . injection for 28 days led to significant decrease in serum TBA and gallbladder weight in C57BL/6J mice. In enterohepatic circulation system, spexin effectively reduced TBA levels in mouse liver and gallbladder but not the intestine. Hepatic cholesterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase 1 (CYP7A1) expression, unsurprisingly, was suppressed by spexin injection. Both GALR2 and GALR3 antagonists reversed the inhibitory effects of spexin on concentrations of serum TBA and 7 \u03b1-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), and hepatic CYP7A1 expression. Finally, negative correlations were observed between serum spexin and total cholesterol (TC), total bile acid (TBA), tauro-chenodeoxycholate (TCDCA), as well as glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDCA) in 91 healthy volunteers. These findings illuminate the intrinsic importance of spexin in the regulation of bile acid synthesis and metabolism.",

        "abstract": "Amorphous Al\u2013Cu\u2013Ti metal foams were prepared by spark plasma sintering (SPS) process with the diameter of 10mm. The SPS process was conducted at the pressure of 200 and 300MPa with the temperature of 653\u2013723K, respectively. NaCl was used as the space-holder, forming almost separated pores with the porosity of 65 vol%. The microstructure and mechanical behavior of the amorphous Al\u2013Cu\u2013Ti metal foams were systematically investigated. The results show that the crystallinity increased at elevated temperatures. The effect of pressure and holding time on the crystallization was almost negligible. The intermetallic compounds, i.e. Al\u2013Ti, Al\u2013Cu and Al\u2013Cu\u2013Ti were identified from X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. It was found that weak adhesion and brittle intermetallic compounds reduced the mechanical properties, while lower volume fraction and smaller size of NaCl powders improved the mechanical properties.",

The ablation process was systematically investigated. The addition of B4C with appropriate amount can efficiently improve the ablation resistance of S-Ph. The results showed that S-Ph containing B4C powder of 2wt.% exhibited the lowest linear and mass ablation rate. The influence mechanism for the results was analyzed deeply. The surface morphologies, phase composition, density and thermal conductivity of composites were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Archimedes method, and thermal conductivity meter, respectively. The present investigation will provide a theoretical basis for the preparation of the ablation resistant material.",

        "abstract": "We have previously reported that the accumulation of IL-17-producing cells could mediate tumor protective immunity by promoting the migration of NK cells, T cells and dendritic cells in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients. However, there were no reports concerning the effect of IL-17A on tumor infiltrating B cells. In this study, we investigated the accumulation of CD20+ B cells in the ESCC tumor nests and further addressed the effect of IL-17A on the migration and cytotoxicity of B cells. There was positive correlation between the levels of CD20+ B cells and IL-17+ cells. IL-17A could promote the ESCC tumor cells to produce more chemokines CCL2, CCL20 and CXCL13, which were associated with the migration of B cells. In addition, IL-17A enhanced the IgG-mediated antibody and complement mediated cytotoxicity of B cells against tumor cells. IL-17A-stimulated B cells gained more effective direct killing capability through enhanced expression of Granzyme B and FasL. The effect of IL-17A on the migration and cytotoxicity of B cells was IL-17A pathway dependent, which could be inhibited by IL-17A inhibitor. This study provides further understanding of the roles of IL-17A in humoral response, which may contribute to the development of novel tumor immunotherapy strategy. ",

        "abstract": "Sanhua decoction (SHD) is a famous classic Chinese herbal prescription for ischemic stroke, and aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is reported to play a key role in ischemic brain edema. This study aimed to investigate neuroprotection of SHD against focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats and explore the hypothesis that AQP4 probably is the target of SHD neuroprotection against I/R rats. Lentiviral-mediated AQP4-siRNA was inducted into adult male Sprague-Dawley rats via intracerebroventricular injection. The focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model was established by occluding middle cerebral artery. Neurological examinations were performed according to Longa Scale. Brain water content, was determined by wet and dry weight measurement. Western blot was adopted to test the AQP4 expression in ipsilateral hippocampus. After the treatment, SHD alleviated neurological deficits, reduced brain water content and downregulated the expression of AQP4 at different time points following I/R injury. Furthermore, neurobehavioral function and brain edema after I/R were significantly attenuated via downregulation of AQP4 expression when combined with AQP4-siRNA technology. In conclusion, SHD exerted neuroprotection against focal cerebral I/R injury in rats mainly through a mechanism targeting AQP4. ",

        "abstract": "Acupuncture for stroke has been used in China for over 2,000 years and nowadays is increasingly practiced elsewhere in the world. However, previous studies had conflicting findings on the results of acupuncture. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the current evidence for the effect of Baihui (GV20)-based scalp acupuncture in animal models of focal cerebral ischemia. Six databases from the inception of each database up to June 2013 were electronically searched. Primary outcomes were infarct size and neurobehavioral outcome. Ultimately, 54 studies involving 1816 animals were identified describing procedures. Meta-analysis results showed that twelve studies reported significant effects of Baihui (GV20)-based scalp acupuncture for improving infarct volume compared with middle cerebral artery occlusion group (P < 0.01), and thirty-two studies reported significant effects of Baihui (GV20)-based scalp acupuncture for improving the neurological function score when compared with the control group (P < 0.01). In conclusion, Baihui (GV20)-based scalp acupuncture could improve infarct volume and neurological function score and exert potential neuroprotective role in experimental ischemic stroke.",

        "title": "TLR4 signaling induces functional nerve growth factor receptor p75NTR on mouse dendritic cells via p38MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways",
        "abstract": "Many neuropeptides that are produced by immune cells have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of immunological disorders. Nerve growth factor (NGF) and its receptors are found to be widely expressed in the immune system and regulate both innate and adaptive immune responses. However, the underlying mechanisms by which NGF contributes to pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases remain to be fully understood. Dendritic cells (DCs) are potent initiator for inflammatory and immune responses upon recognization and activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). In this study, we demonstrated that stimulation with TLR ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but not lipoteichoic acid (LTA), Poly (I:C) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), could significantly induce expression of NGF and NGF receptor p75NTR on mouse bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) in vitro in dose- and time-dependent manners. The expression of NGF and NGF receptor p75NTR also increased on splenic DCs isolated from the mice injected with LPS in vivo. However, there was no such effect on DCs derived from TLR4-deficient mice, indicating the LPS-induced upregulation of NGF and p75NTR was TLR4 pathway-dependent. Furthermore, LPS-induced upregulation of NGF and p75NTR could be inhibited by p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and NF-\u03baB inhibitor PDTC, suggesting TLR4-triggered activation of p38MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways are responsible for the process. Interestingly, NGF could markedly promote LPS-pretreated BMDCs to secret IL-12p40 and TNF-\u03b1, which could be abolished by pretreatment with p75NTR antagonist or the specific small interference RNA duplex targeting p75NTR (p75-siRNA), suggesting the inducible p75NTR is critical for the TLR4-initiated inflammatory effect of NGF on BMDCs. Thus, TLR4 signaling can induce expression of NGF and p75 NTR on DCs via activation of p38 MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways, suggesting that NGF may be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "A sensitive non-enzymatic glucose electrochemical biosensor (Cu/PMo12-GR/GCE) was developed based on the combination of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) and phosphomolybdic acid functionalized graphene (PMo12-GR). PMo12-GR films were modified on the surface of glassy carbon electrode (GCE) through electrostatic self-assembly with the aid of poly diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (PDDA). Then CuNPs were successfully decorated onto the PMo12-GR modified GCE through electrodeposition. The morphology of Cu/PMo12-GR/GCE was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry were used to investigate the electrochemical performances of the biosensor. The results indicated that the modified electrode displayed a synergistic effect of PMo12-GR sheets and CuNPs towards the electro-oxidation of glucose in the alkaline solution. At the optimal detection potential of 0.50\u00a0V, the response towards glucose presented a linear response ranging from 0.10\u00a0\u03bcM to 1.0\u00a0mM with a detection limit of 3.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-2)\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0(S/N\u00a0=\u00a03). In addition, Cu/PMo12-GR/GCE possessed a high selectivity, good reproducibility, excellent stability and acceptable recovery, which indicating the potential application in clinical field. ",

The obtained PtCo/GCG electrocatalyst has been characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and also electrochemical measurements. Structure characterization indicates that the PtCo/GCG catalyst has good layered graphene morphology, with PtCo nanoparticles uniformly dispersed between the graphene layers. Electrochemical results indicate that PtCo/GCG catalyst has much better electrocatalytic activity and stability toward methanol oxidation when compared with PtCo/graphene and Pt catalysts. The improved performance is mainly owing to the embedding of carbon dots into the graphene layers, and the synergistic effect between Pt and Co nanoparticles. Carbon dots effectively adsorbed onto graphene layers, which increase the electrical conductivity, enhance the dispersion of PtCo nanoparticles, and subsequently enlarge the reactive surface area with more active sites.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The integration of \u201csignal on/off\u201d and \u201clabeling/label-free\u201d strategies was applied to the fabrication of a sensitive and selective dual-signalling electrochemical aptasensor. Ferrocene (Fc), being labeled on single stranded DNA as one signal indicator, could provide \u201cturn on\u201d signal through the DNA conformational changes resulted from target binding with aptamer. [Ru(NH 3 ) 6 ] 3+  (RuHex), as another signal indicator, could provide \u201cturn off\u201d signal through the electrostatic interaction between the anionic DNA phosphate backbones and the cationic RuHex, which is a label-free signal. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) were employed for monitoring the stepwise fabrication process of the biosensor. Under the optimized conditions, the dual signal changes were quantified using square wave voltammetry (SWV). Based on the superposition of the dual signal changes (|D I  RuHex |\u00a0+\u00a0\u0394 I  Fc ), the sensitivity of this aptasensor for lysozyme detection was improved compared to individual signal. The results indicated that lysozyme could be detected in a wide linear range (1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u221211 \u20131.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22127 \u00a0M) with a low detection limit down to 0.8 pM. Moreover, the resulting biosensor exhibited good specificity, stability and reproducibility, indicating that the present strategy was promising for broad potential application in clinic assay.",
