Their surface micromorphologies were assessed by atomic force microscopy (AFM).\n It was found that the micromorphology of chitosan/PCL blend films was in large extent related to the mass ratio of chitosan.\n 25 wt% chitosan/PCL blend film presented microphase separation. The protein adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) onto\n chitosan/PCL blend films was investigated by using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) in real\n time. The results suggested that the amount of adsorbed BSA on the chitosan/PCL blend films decreased with the addition of\n chitosan, but the structure and viscoelastic properties of the adsorbed BSA layers were greatly affected by the surface micromorphology\n of chitosan/PCL blend films. BSA absorbed on the 25 wt% chitosan/PCL blend film with microphase separation showed larger adsorption\n reversibility, and preferred to form a loose, dissipative layer in comparison with those on other chitosan/PCL blend films\n without microphase separation.",

A heparin conjugation percentage of about 90% was obtained by elemental analysis. Hyaluronan microgels showed a smooth surface and dense network, whereas HA-Hp microgels exhibited a rougher surface with holes and concaves, and a looser internal structure with increasing the heparin content instead. However, the major microgel size of about 3 \u03bcm was independent of the heparin amount. Among the samples, HA-Hp-10% microgels existed the highest equilibrium swelling ratio of 11.8 due to its least cross-linking network. A higher BMP-2 loading efficiency and a slower release profile with increasing the heparin content indicated the conjugated heparin in HA-Hp microgels was in favor of BMP-2 binding and the sustained delivery maybe attributed to the electrostatic interaction between heparin and BMP-2.",

PPC scaffold with interconnected solid pore wall structure was prepared by the first phase separation, which showed a high porosity of 91.9% and a good compressive modulus of 14.2 \u00b1 0.56 MPa, respectively. By the second phase separation, nanofibrous chitosan of 50-500 nm in diameter was formed in the macropores with little influence on the pore structure and the mechanical properties of PPC scaffold. The nanofibrous chitosan content was calculated to be 9.78% by elemental analysis. After incubation in SBF for 14 days, more apatite crystals were deposited on the pore surface as well as the nanofibrous chitosan surface of PPC/CSNFs scaffold compared with PPC scaffold. The in vitro culture of bone mesenchymal stem cells showed that PPC/CSNFs scaffold exhibited a better cell viability than PPC scaffold. After implantation in rabbits for 16 weeks, the defect was entirely repaired by PPC/CSNFs scaffold, as opposed to the incomplete healing for PPC scaffold. It indicated that PPC/CSNFs scaffold showed a faster in vivo osteogenesis rate than PPC scaffold. Hereby, PPC/CSNFs scaffold will be a potential candidate for bone tissue engineering.",

PPC/polyvinyl chloride (PVC) blend films with different liquid crystal content were prepared by solvent evaporation,and their protein adsorption at 37\u2103 was measured by Coomassie brilliant blue method using bovine serum albumin (BSA). The results showed that the addition of PPC liquid crystal could significantly reduce the protein adsorption amount of BSA on the PPC/PVC blend films,and the protein adsorption of blend films was affected by not only the content of PPC liquid crystal but also the morphology of liquid crystal domain. PPC liquid crystal may provide an alternative strategy for the development of anti-biofouling polymeric materials.",

        "abstract": "A biomimetic nanofibrous poly(L-lactide) scaffold strengthened by nanohydroxyapatite particles was fabricated via a thermally induced phase separation technique. Scanning electron microscopy results showed that nanohydroxyapatite particles uniformly dispersed in the nanofibrous poly(L-lactide) scaffold (50-500 nm in fiber diameter) with slight aggregation at a high nHA content, but showed no influence on the interconnected macroporous and nanofibrous structure of the scaffold. The nanofibrous poly(L-lactide) scaffold presented a specific surface area of 34.06 m2 g -1, which was much higher than that of 2.79 m2 g -1 for the poly(L-lactide) scaffold with platelet structure. Moreover, the specific surface area of the nanofibrous scaffold was further enhanced by incorporating nanohydroxyapatite particles. With increasing the nanohydroxyapatite content, the compressive modulus and amount of bovine serum albumin adsorbed on the surface of the nanofibrous composite scaffold were markedly improved, as opposed to the decreased crystallinity. In comparison to poly(L-lactide) scaffold, both the nanofibrous poly(L-lactide) and poly(L-lactide)/nanohydroxyapatite scaffolds exhibited a faster degradation rate for their much larger specific surface area. The culture of bone mesenchymal stem cell indicated that the composite nanofibrous poly(L-lactide) scaffold with 50 wt % nanohydroxyapatite showed the highest cells viability among various poly(L-lactide)-based scaffolds. The strengthened biomimetic nanofibrous poly(L-lactide)/nanohydroxyapatite composite scaffold will be a potential candidate for bone tissue engineering. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "A novel approach to construct biomimetic nanocarriers with suppression of the protein-nanocarrier interactions was developed. Firstly, biomimetic N-phosphorylcholine-chitosan derivative (N-PCCs) with biomembrane-like phosphorylcholine (PC) group was successfully synthesized through Atherton-Todd reaction and subsequently hydrolysis, and structurally characterized. Using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein, UV adsorption spectra and fluorescence spectra revealed that the interactions between N-PCCs and BSA were effectively suppressed and the conformation of BSA was almost unchanged with the addition of N-PCCs. Moreover, N-PCCs nanoparticles can be easily formed by ionic crosslinking with lower particle size and zeta potential value compared with Cs nanoparticles. The results suggested that biomimetic N-PCCs nanoparticles may be used as a promising nanocarrier avoiding unfavorable biological response for effectively delivering therapeutic and/or diagnostic agents. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a macromolecular model-drug, in vitro drug release studies indicated that chitosan-based nanofibers and nanoparticles exhibited a similar prolonged release profile. In addition, the bioinspired mineralization of both chitosan-based nanofibers and nanoparticles was carried out by soaking them in synthetic body fluids (SBF). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) results indicated that chitosan-based nanofibers have better inductivity for nano-hydroxyapatite formation than chitosan-based nanoparticles.

On PLA substrate, network structures formed in high humidity atmosphere. In addition, collagen formed well-oriented nano-patterns at nearly neutral pH and appropriate electrolyte composition. Particularly, the typical 65 nm D-periodicity of collagen fibers was observed in the presence of potassium ions. Our investigation provides useful insights into the regulation of collagen assembly by substrates and environmental conditions, which is important for understanding the mechanism of collagen adsorption and assembly on polymer surfaces.

Herein, we reported a facile approach to construct a biodegradable anti-biofouling and functionalizable hydrogel coating via photo-immobilization using commercial polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films as the substrate, based on zwitterionic glycidyl methacrylate-phosphorylcholine-chitosan (PCCs-GMA). The surface structure and physicochemical properties of zwitterionic PCCs-GMA hydrogel coating were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscope (AFM) and static water contact angle measurement, and its functionalizable sites were detected by fluorescence labeling. Compared with the pristine PET and cationic chitosan - GMA and hydroxypropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride chitosan (HTCC) - GMA hydrogel coatings, zwitterionic PCCs-GMA hydrogel coating exhibited excellent biocompatibility, and significantly reduced protein adsorption for three model proteins of fibrinogen, immunoglobulin and lysozyme, repelled platelet adhesion, as well as showed a high resistance to bacterial attachment of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. and superior anti-fouling properties to MRC-5 cells.

        "abstract": "Novel water-soluble biomimetic phosphorylcholine (PC) - bound chitosan derivatives (N-PCCs) with different degree of substitution (DS) via a phosphoramide linkage between glucosamine and PC were synthesized through Atherton-Todd reaction under the mild conditions, and structurally characterized by 1H-NMR, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Their DS ranged from \u223c 16 to \u223c 42 mol % based on the 1H-NMR spectra. All these N-PCCs with decreased crystallization showed excellent solubility in the aqueous solutions within a wide pH range (1-12). DSC and TGA results revealed that the thermal stability of N-PCCs decreased with the increase of DS value. Further, N-PCCs nanoparticles could be still formed in a spherical shape similar to chitosan nanoparticles by ionic gelation technique, observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) results suggested that the zeta potential value of N-PCCs nanoparticles decreased with the DS value increasing. Using 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) as a model drug, in vitro drug release studies indicated that N-PCCs nanoparticles exhibited a similar prolonged release profile as chitosan nanoparticles. The results suggested that N-PCCs nanoparticles could be used as promising nanocarriers for drug delivery applications. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "title": "Preparation, structure and crystallinity of chitosan nano-fibers by a solid\u2013liquid phase separation technique",
        "abstract": "Chitosan acetate nano-fibers were fabricated via a solid\u2013liquid phase separation technique. The chitosan acetate structure was influenced by phase separation temperature, chitosan concentration and acetic acid concentration. Uniform nano-fibrous chitosan acetate of 50\u2013500 nm in diameter was engineered at 0.05% (w/v) chitosan and 0.025% (v/v) acetic acid in liquid nitrogen, as opposed to film-shape and micro-fibrous structure at \u221218 \u00b0C and \u221280 \u00b0C respectively. Decreasing the chitosan concentration led to the formation of nano-fibrous/floccules-like structure, while increasing the acetic acid concentration resulted in nano-/micro-fibrous structure instead. The chitosan acetate structure was closely related to the crystallinity varying with different phase separation conditions. Nano-fibrous chitosan acetate showed a medium crystallinity with a glass transition temperature of 155.1 \u00b0C and a heat capacity of 29.1 J/g comparing with nano-fibrous/floccules-like and nano-/micro-fibrous samples. The chitosan acetate crystal was also found changeable from form I to form II after solid\u2013liquid phase separation in liquid nitrogen. Key words Chitosan Nano-fibrous Solid\u2013liquid phase separation Structure Crystallinity 1 Introduction Conventionally, fibers having diameters less than 1 \u03bcm would be classified as nano-fibers. Due to their small scale in diameter, nano-fibrous materials have a very high surface-to-volume ratio, which makes them very good candidates for the delivery of bioactive agents as well as the tissue engineering matrices ( Sahoo, Ang, Goh, & Toh, 2010; Wei & Ma, 2008; Zhao, Tanaka, Kinoshita, Higuchi, & Tan, 2010 ). Nano-fibrous materials not only can enhance protein adsorption, but also can promote cells attachment, migration, proliferation and differentiation ( Hu, Feng, Liu, & Ma, 2009; Smith, Liu, Hu, & Ma, 2009; Woo, Chen, & Ma, 2003 ). As a main natural extracellular matrix (ECM) component, collagen does possess a nano-fibrous structure with fiber bundle diameter of from 50 to 500 nm, which plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of cells function in human body ( Elsdale & Bard, 1972; Hay, 1991, chap. 7 ). Hence, engineering materials mimicking the nano-fibrous structure of collagen in the natural ECM is one challenging work in tissue engineering. To engineer nano-fibrous materials, several technologies such as self-assembly, electrospinning and thermal induced phase separation (TIPS) have been developed ( Ma & Zhang, 1999; Matthews, Wnek, Simpson, & Bowlin, 2002; Yu et al., 1999 ). Self-assembly is currently limited to biological molecules such as peptides with a small fiber diameter of less than 20 nm, and the engineered peptide nano-fibers can be fragmented and may be susceptible to endocytosis ( Beniash, Hartgerink, Storrie, & Stupp, 2005 ). The electrospun fibers often have diameters in the micrometer range, and this technique is also hard to generate designed internal macro pore structure ( Ma, 2008 ). However, phase separation, primarily TIPS, can simultaneously realize both nano-fibrous structure with a fiber diameter of 50\u2013500 nm and designed macro porous architecture ( Chen & Ma, 2004 ). In addition, TIPS technique has good potential in preparing composite nano-fibrous matrices via dual or multiple phase separation processes as well. These exciting advantages make TIPS a very promising way to fabricate biomimetic nano-fibers or 3D nano-fibrous matrices in tissue engineering. TIPS process takes place from a thermodynamically unstable homogeneous polymer solution tending to separate into a polymer-rich phase and a polymer-lean phase under certain temperature conditions ( Ma & Zhang, 1999 ). After removal of the solvent, the polymer-rich phase solidifies to form the matrix while polymer-lean phase becomes pores. Based on the different phase separation conditions, TIPS may be divided into liquid\u2013liquid phase separation and solid\u2013liquid phase separation. Liquid\u2013liquid phase separation is typical of a polymer solution with an upper critical temperature accompanying the formation of bicontinuous phase structure (polymer-rich and polymer-lean phases), while solid\u2013liquid phase separation displays solvent crystallization from a polymer solution instead ( Ma, 2004 ). In recent years, a number of polymeric nano-fibrous matrices, such as poly( l -lactide), poly(hydroxyalkyl methacrylate)-graft-poly( l -lactide), polyhydroxyalkanoates and gelatin, have been investigated using a liquid\u2013liquid phase separation technique ( Li, Zhang, & Chen, 2008; Liu & Ma, 2009, 2010; Ma & Zhang, 1999 ). The formation and structure of nano-fibrous matrices depend on the gelation of polymer-solvent system which is driven by thermal energy and greatly influenced by temperature, polymer concentration and solvent properties (single or multiple solvent systems). He et al also found that gelation temperature had an influence on the crystallization of poly( l -lactide), and the poly( l -lactide) microcrystalline domains from the gelation could stabilize the polymer-solvent system and prevent further phase separation ( He et al., 2009 ). However, very few researches have been focused on the polymeric nano-fibers preparation by using solid\u2013liquid phase separation approach. The effects of temperature, polymer concentration and solvent properties on the nano-fibrous structure and crystallinity of polymer in the solid\u2013liquid phase separation process have not been known yet. A variety of synthetic polymeric nano-fibers have been previously engineered by TIPS technique, but few natural macromolecules have been concerned. Chitosan, a copolymer of glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine derived from the natural polymer chitin, has been attracted much interest in tissue engineering and drug delivery due to its biocompatible, biodegradable, antimicrobial and nontoxic properties ( Bhattarai, Edmondson, Veiseh, Matsen, & Zhang, 2005; Lim & Hudson, 2003 ). In this work, the preparation of chitosan acetate nano-fibers by a solid\u2013liquid phase separation technique has been illustrated. The effects of phase separation temperature, chitosan concentration and acetic concentration on the structure and crystallinity of chitosan acetate matrices have also been investigated. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Chitosan (85% deacetylated, viscosity of 1% (w/v) solution in 1% (v/v) acetic acid = 200 cps) was purchased from Shandong Institute of Medical Instruments. All other reagents and solvents used were analytical grade. 2.2 Preparation of chitosan acetate nano-fibers The preparation of chitosan acetate nano-fibers by solid\u2013liquid phase separation under different phase separation temperature, chitosan concentration, and acetic acid concentration were briefly described as follows: For the phase separation temperature effect studies, 0.05% (w/v) chitosan solution was prepared by dissolving 5.0 mg chitosan in 10 mL 0.025% (v/v) acetic acid aqueous solution at room temperature. Then, the mixtures were cooled at \u221218 \u00b0C, \u221280 \u00b0C and by soaking in liquid nitrogen respectively for 2 h. The chitosan acetate matrices were obtained by lyophilization at 0.5 mm Hg for 48 h at \u221280 \u00b0C. For the chitosan concentration effect studies, 0.01%, 0.025% and 0.05% (w/v) chitosan solutions were obtained by dissolving different weight chitosan in a certain volume 0.025% (v/v) acetic acid aqueous solution at room temperature. Subsequently, the mixtures were soaked in liquid nitrogen for 2 h. The chitosan acetate matrices were lyophilized at 0.6 mbar for 48 h at \u221280 \u00b0C. For the acetic acid concentration effect studies, a series of 0.05% (w/v) chitosan solutions were prepared by dissolving 5.0 mg chitosan in 10 mL acetic acid aqueous solutions of 0.025%, 0.05% and 0.1% (v/v) respectively at room temperature, following by soaking in liquid nitrogen for 2 h. The chitosan acetate matrices were produced after lyophilization at 0.6 mbar for 48 h at \u221280 \u00b0C. 2.3 Characterization The morphology of chitosan acetate matrices prepared under different preparation conditions was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (PHILIPSXL-30ESEM). Before SEM analysis, a gold layer was coated on the specimen surface in a sputter coater (BAL-TEC, SCD005). The thermal properties of chitosan acetate matrices were analyzed by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) (NETZSCH DSC 204F1 Phoenix, Germany) in a temperature range from 0 \u00b0C to 300 \u00b0C with a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min. The first heating was used for the analysis. The crystal structure of chitosan acetate matrices was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, which was performed using a X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 Focus, Germany) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation at a generator voltage of 40 kV and a generator current of 40 mA. Samples were scanned from 2 \u03b8 = 10\u201380\u00b0 at a scanning rate of 8\u00b0/min. 3 3 Results and discussion 3.1 SEM observations In order to ensure chitosan complete dissolution in acetic acid aqueous solution, excess acetic acid was used based on the stoichiometric calculation of carboxyl groups in acetic acid and amino groups in chitosan, as shown in Table 1 . The data summarized in Table 1 showed that temperature, polymer concentration and solvent properties had significant effects on the morphologies of chitosan acetate matrices in the solid\u2013liquid phase separation process. Nano-fibrous, micro-fibrous film-shape and floccules-like structure were formed under different conditions. Uniform nano-fibrous structure could be achieved at an optimal solid\u2013liquid phase separation condition: 0.05% (m/v) chitosan, 0.025% (v/v) acetic acid and liquid nitrogen environment ( Fig. 1 ). The diameter of nano-fibers ranged from 50 to 500 nm, which is similar to the fibrillar structure of collagen in the natural ECM ( Hay, 1991 ). A solid\u2013liquid phase separation will take place when a polymer solution is cooled quickly to freeze the solvent and there is not enough time for liquid\u2013liquid phase separation to occur. In this process, the quenching temperature is a key factor in controlling the morphology of resultant polymer matrix because the crystalline morphologies of the polymer and solvent are dependent on the crystallization temperature ( Zhang & Ma, 1999 ). Here, the effects of cooling temperature on the architecture of chitosan acetate matrices were investigated. The freezing point of acetic acid aqueous solution with a concentration range of 0.025% (v/v)\u20130.1% (v/v) was about \u22125 \u00b0C, which was tested in our lab. When the solutions were cooled down to lower than this temperature, the solubility of chitosan acetate would decrease so that the solid\u2013liquid phase separation process would take place at a certain temperature. The crystallization process includes two stages: nucleation and crystal growth. Generally, a lower temperature induces a higher nucleation rate and a lower crystal growth rate, vice versa ( Boyer & Haudin, 2010 ). The SEM images of chitosan acetate matrices prepared at different quenching temperatures are shown in Fig. 2 . Film-shape structure was obtained at \u221218 \u00b0C, which is slightly lower than the freezing point of acetic acid aqueous solution ( Fig. 2 a); meanwhile, a slow cooling rate leaded to a fast crystal growth and the formation of large chitosan acetate crystals. When a quenching temperature of \u221280 \u00b0C was used, the chitosan solution showed a higher nucleation rate and a slower crystal growth rate than that at \u221218 \u00b0C, and micro-fibrous structure accompanying some small film-shape chitosan acetate matrices was produced ( Fig. 2 b). Once the chitosan solution was dipped into liquid nitrogen, it would be frozen in a second. The instant nucleation and very slow crystal growth resulted in the formation of nano-fibers with a bundle diameter varying from 50 to 500 nm ( Fig. 2 c and d). These results indicated that the supercooling environment in liquid nitrogen was in favor of the formation of uniform nano-scale chitosan acetate fibers. We hypothesized that the formation of nano-fibrous structure was attributed to the sudden freezing of the stretched chitosan acetate molecular chains in a low chitosan concentration solution and the following hyperslow crystal growth rate under liquid nitrogen conditions. In contrast, when the solution was cooled down at a higher temperature of \u221280 \u00b0C or \u221218 \u00b0C, a faster growth of chitosan acetate molecules along the crystal nucleus led to the generation of micro-fibrous or film-shape structure. The phenomenon of chitosan acetate structure significantly changing with quenching temperature is very different from that in liquid\u2013liquid phase separation, where it was considered that the fiber diameter of the matrix did not change with the gelling temperature as long as it was in the fiber-forming temperature range ( Ma & Zhang, 1999 ). Beside the quenching temperature, the polymer concentration and solvent properties also play a vital role in the polymer crystal morphology ( Rogers & Marangoni, 2009; Zhang, Li, Nies, Berghmans, & Ge, 2009 ). In this work, we studied the effects of chitosan concentration and acetic acid concentration on the structure of chitosan acetate matrices in liquid nitrogen. As mentioned in Fig. 1 , uniform nano-fibrous structure could be obtained at a condition of 0.05% (w/v) chitosan and 0.025% (v/v) acetic acid in liquid nitrogen. However, when the chitosan concentration decreased to 0.025% (m/v) or lower, some small floccules occurred on the chitosan acetate nano-fibers surface ( Fig. 3 a) . It might be the reason that in a diluted solution system with an enough low chitosan concentration and excess stoichiometric quantity of acetic acid, the obtained chitosan acetate molecules tended to form random coil, which was responsible for the floccules-like structure during the solid\u2013liquid phase separation process. In contrast, when the chitosan concentration was maintained at 0.05% (m/v) and the concentration of acetic acid aqueous solution was raised to 0.05% (v/v), a very different chitosan acetate morphology of nano-/micro-fibrous structure was engineered comparing with the nano-fibrous/floccules-like structure at 0.025% (m/v) chitosan and 0.025% (v/v) acetic acid even though the molar ratio of [COOH]/[NH 2 ] was same for both systems ( Fig. 3 b), but more similar to the nano-fibrous structure obtained at 0.05% (w/v) chitosan and 0.025% (v/v) acetic acid. These results showed that in a certain concentration range of chitosan diluted solution, too low chitosan concentration led to the formation of floccules-like structure while an adequate chitosan concentration was in favor of the generation of nano-fibrous structure instead, which might be relevant to the conformation and distribution of chitosan acetate molecules in the solution. It suggested that the structure of chitosan acetate was more relied on the chitosan concentration than on acetic acid concentration. 3.2 DSC analysis The glass transition temperature ( T g ) and heat capacity ( C p ) of chitosan acetate matrices prepared under different conditions were measured by DSC. Fig. 4 showed the first-heating DSC curves of chitosan acetate matrices prepared at optimal chitosan and acetic acid concentration under different quenching temperatures. The DSC thermogram of chitosan acetate control sample showed a broad endothermic peak around 75 \u00b0C ( Fig. 4 a), which might be due to the vaporization of water contaminant in the polysaccharide backbone ( Zong, Kimura, Takahashi, & Yamane, 2000 ). Although chitosan acetate had crystalline regions, the T g was not found except a decomposition peak around 300 \u00b0C because the chitosan acetate backbone had strong inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonding ( Dong, Ruan, Wang, Zhao, & Bi, 2004 ). However, by quenching the chitosan solution at different temperatures, the chitosan acetate matrices showed obvious glass transition regions at 150\u2013200 \u00b0C. Furthermore, with decreasing the cooling temperature from \u221218 \u00b0C to liquid nitrogen, the T g reduced from 185.4 \u00b0C to 155.1 \u00b0C and the corresponding C p increased from 14.5 J/g to 29.1 J/g instead, as shown in Fig. 4 b\u2013d. It could be explained that at a lower quenching temperature, chitosan acetate showed a faster nucleation rate and a slower crystal growth rate, so that more crystallographic defects were generated and there existed more space for chitosan acetate molecule chains to change their conformation. Hence, the chitosan acetate molecules were easier to change the conformation and exhibited a lower T g when heating; meanwhile more chain segment motion took place and resulted in a higher C p as well. As mentioned in Section 3.1 , nano-fibrous chitosan acetate could be formed in liquid nitrogen instead of film-shape structure at \u221218 \u00b0C. It suggested that the crystallinity of chitosan acetate significantly affected by the cooling temperature was responsible for the product structure fabricated at different temperatures. The formation of nano-fibrous chitosan acetate should be owed to its lower crystallinity prepared in liquid nitrogen. As described in Section 3.1 , the concentration of chitosan and acetic acid had an effect on the structure of chitosan acetate during the solid\u2013liquid phase separation. The influence of chitosan concentration and acetic acid concentration on the thermal properties of chitosan acetate matrices was also studied, as shown in Fig. 5 . All the first-heating DSC curves exhibited a visible glass transition region around 150 \u00b0C. For the sample with uniform nano-fibrous structure prepared at the optimal conditions of 0.05% (w/v) chitosan and 0.025% (v/v) acetic acid in liquid nitrogen, chitosan acetate showed a T g of 155.1 \u00b0C and a C p of 29.1 J/g, whereas at a lower chitosan concentration of 0.025% (w/v), a lower T g of 152.3 \u00b0C and a higher C p of 39.0 J/g were obtained. It was possible that the relatively imperfect chitosan acetate crystals formed at a lower chitosan concentration leaded to a lower T g and a higher C p since a sample with a lower crystallinity usually possesses a lower T g and a higher C p ( Schick, 2009 ). In contrast, when keeping the chitosan concentration at 0.05% (w/v) and increasing the acetic acid concentration to 0.05% (v/v), the chitosan acetate presented a higher T g of 157.2 \u00b0C and a lower C p of 27.1 J/g instead, which were closer to the T g and C p values at 0.05% (w/v) chitosan and 0.025% (v/v) acetic acid than those obtained at 0.025% (w/v) chitosan and 0.025% (v/v) acetic acid. These results indicated the crystallinity of chitosan acetate was more dependent on the chitosan concentration than on the acetic acid concentration. Furthermore, a higher chitosan concentration was beneficial to produce higher T g and lower C p maybe attributing to the formation of relatively perfect chitosan acetate crystals. The effect of chitosan concentration and acetic acid concentration on the crystallinity of chitosan acetate was in accordance with that on the structure of chitosan acetate. Hence, it can be deduced that the structure of chitosan acetate formed in the solid\u2013liquid phase separation was correlative to the crystallinity of chitosan acetate. 3.3 XRD analysis The XRD patterns of chitosan acetate matrices before and after solid\u2013liquid phase separation were shown in Fig. 6 . Before solid\u2013liquid phase separation, the peaks of chitosan acetate at around 2 \u03b8 = 11.4\u00b0 and 22.0\u00b0 were attributed to the diffraction from the chitosan acetate crystal planes of (1 0 0) and (0 2 0) respectively ( Fig. 6 a) ( Zeng et al., 2009 ). According to the previous report, the reflection at 2 \u03b8 = 11.4\u00b0 assigned to crystal form I and the stronger reflection appeared at 2 \u03b8 = 22.0\u00b0 corresponded to crystal form II ( Ma, Qian, Yang, Hu, & Nie, 2010 ). However, in the patterns of chitosan acetate matrices after solid\u2013liquid phase separation in liquid nitrogen, the (1 0 0) reflection peak disappeared and the (0 2 0) reflection peak was slightly strengthen ( Fig. 6 b). It seemed that the crystal form I of chitosan acetate was changed to crystal form II after solid\u2013liquid phase separation. It might be ascribed to the chitosan acetate chain structure changes between chitosan acetate flake state and quenching state from chitosan solution ( Zong, Kimura, Takahashi, & Yamane, 2000 ). 4 Conclusions Various chitosan acetate structure, i.e. nano-fibrous, micro-fibrous, film-shape and floccules-like, were generated by solid\u2013liquid phase separation, which was dramatically influenced by the phase separation temperature, chitosan concentration as well as acetic acid concentration. Phase separation temperature was the predominant factor of chitosan acetate structure. A lower quenching temperature facilitated the formation of nano-fibrous structure; meanwhile the structure of chitosan acetate was more affected by the chitosan concentration than by the acetic acid concentration. Uniform chitosan acetate nano-fibers with a bundle diameter range of 50\u2013500 nm could be engineered under optimal conditions of 0.05% (w/v) chitosan, 0.025% (v/v) acetic acid and liquid nitrogen. The phase separation conditions had a significant effect on the crystallinity of chitosan acetate matrices, which was responsible for product structure obtained by solid\u2013liquid phase separation, and a lower crystallinity was in favor of the formation of nano-fibrous structure. Furthermore, chitosan acetate crystal form was also changed from I to II after solid\u2013liquid phase separation in liquid nitrogen. Hence, the structure and crystallinity of polymer can be regulated by solid\u2013liquid phase separation technique, which will be a potential tool to fabricate nano-fibrous structure for tissue engineering materials.

        "abstract": "A ternary composite scaffold of poly(L-lactide)/hydroxyapatite/chitosan fibers was fabricated for bone tissue engineering. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that hydroxyapatite particles and chitosan fibers in microscale uniformly distributing in poly(L-lactide) matrix not only increased the mechanical property but also prevented the crack and platelet formation on the pore surface of poly(L-lactide) matrix at cooling. The X-ray diffraction peak intensity of poly(Llactide) component decrease may be due to the presence of hydroxyapatite particles and chitosan fibers as the crystal nuclei that led to the crystallinity decrease of poly(L-lactide). The in vitro degradation test showed that the degradation of poly(L-lactide) was resisted by enhancing the chitosan fiber content. The bone mesenchymal stem cell culture indicated that the composite scaffolds promoted the attachment and proliferation of cells, which would likely attach to and stretch along the chitosan fibers. Therefore, this ternary composite scaffold will be a promising matrix material for bone tissue engineering. \u00a9 2012 by Walter de Gruyter \u2022 Berlin \u2022 Boston.",

The result showed that tightly collagen layers was obtained, on the one hand, by fast drying under a nitrogen flow and nano-patterned structure was obtained by slow drying under high humidity and long drying duration for dewetting occurred to the liquid-substrate interface. The discontinuous patterned structure was regulated by drying duration, concentration of collagen solution and the hydrophobicity of substrate. With increasing drying duration, continuous collagen layer ruptured and nano-patterned structure formed ;and With increasing concentration of collagen layer, the density of the net-like structure increased. The hydrophobicity of substrates differed with the molecular weight of PLLA. The greater M\u0304w was, the stronger the hydrophobicity and the effect of dewetting.

Compared with conventional heating, the effects of solvent, time and MDI concentrations on the microwave-assisted MDI-functionalization, and the effect of time on the microwave-assisted PEG coupling were studied. PEGs with different molecular weights were successfully grafted onto PU surface under the optimum microwave-assisted conditions within only 20. min, and characterized by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and chemical titration. The hydrophilicity and in vitro blood compatibility of the surfaces were evaluated by water contact angle measurements, blood coagulation time (whole blood clotting time and prothrombin time) and platelet adhesion tests, respectively. All the PU-PEG surfaces had improved surface wettability and hemocompatibility. The results suggested that microwave-assisted functionalization may be a promising method for rapidly and effectively decorating polyurethane surfaces. \u00a9 2013 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.",

The first phase separation was used to build a nanofibrous poly(L-lactide) scaffold with interconnected macropores, where chitosan nanofibers about 500nm in diameter were incorporated via the second phase separation. The content of nanofibrous chitosan was determined to be 5.76 in weight percentage by elemental analysis. The composite scaffold showed the highest protein adsorption of 7225\u00b1116 \u03bcg/cm(3) and the most hydroxyapatite crystal deposition in the mineralization. Compared with non-nanofibrous poly(L-lactide) scaffold, nanofibrous poly(L-lactide) scaffold exhibited a much faster degradation, but it could be restrained by the introduced chitosan nanofibers. The bone mesenchymal stem cell culture results indicated that the cells would rather attach and stretch along the chitosan nanofibers in the composite scaffold that showed the highest viability and the best cytocompatibility may be attributed to the biomimetic nanofibrous network and good cell affinity of chitosan nanofibers.",

The incorporation of zwitterionic PC groups modified the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance of chitosan derivatives to induce the formation of nanosized micelles by self-assembly in neutral aqueous solution. Fluorescence measurements revealed that the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) of PCCs solutions increased with increasing the DS of PC. The physicochemical properties of PCCs aggregates in neutral aqueous solutions were investigated by AFM and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The results confirmed that the amphiphilic PCCs copolymers can self-assemble to form nanosized spherical micelles with zeta potential between 0 and 4 mV, suggesting that the PCCs nano-aggregates were mostly covered with electrically neutral zwitterionic PC groups. Furthermore, all the PCCs samples showed low toxicity against NIH/3T3 cells after incubated for 4 h or 24 h, indicating their safety for biomedical application.",

        "abstract": "Poly(L-lactide) films with a nano-structured surface by immobilizing chitosan nanofibers (CSNFs) for improving the cell affinity were fabricated via a solid-liquid phase separation technique. The successful grafting of CSNFs on the surface of poly(L-lactide) films was confirmed by the binding energy of N1s at 398.0 eV in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and the amide I and II bands of chitosan at 1650 and 1568 cm(-1) in the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Compared with the poly(L-lactide) film, the hydrophilicity was improved with a lower water contact angle of 83.3\u00b11.9\u00b0 and 75.3\u00b12.5\u00b0 for the CSNFs-grafted and CSNFs-grafted/anchored poly(L-lactide) films respectively. The scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy analyses showed that the grafted CSNFs with 50-500 nm in diameter were randomly arranged on the film surface and entangled with the anchored CSNFs on the outermost layer. The 3T3 fibroblasts culture indicated cells tended to attach and stretch along the CSNFs on the film surface. The cell viability measurement revealed that among all the samples, the film with both grafted and anchored CSNFs exhibited the highest cell proliferation rate that was twice as much of the poly(L-lactide) film at 7 d. Herein, engineering a nano-structured surface by solid-liquid phase separation will be a promising tool for surface modification of biomaterials.",

Here, biomimetic phosphorylcholine-chitosan nanoparticles (PCCs-NPs) taking advantages of both zwitterionic phosphorylcholine and chitosan were developed as a pulmonary protein delivery platform. msFGFR2c, a potential therapeutic protein for lung fibrosis as model was loaded into PCCs-NPs via ionic gelation. The obtained msFGFR2c/PCCs-NPs inhibited \u03b1-SMA expression in fibroblasts induced by TGF-\u03b21, slightly more effective than naked msFGFR2c. After orotracheal administration to bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis model rats, msFGFR2c/PCCs-NPs resulted in a significant antifibrotic efficacy, with reduction in inflammatory cytokines and \u03b1-SMA expression, remarkable attenuation of lung fibrosis score and collagen deposition, and significant increase in survival rate, while naked msFGFR2c exhibited a poor efficacy. The in vitro and in vivo results strongly indicated that PCCs-NPs may be a promising nanocarrier for pulmonary protein delivery.",

Developments associated with this promising system have been largely concentrated on areas of drug delivery kinetics and biodegradability. In order to provide surface analytical approaches to this important system, the authors demonstrate applicability of time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) in three-dimensional molecular imaging for a model system consisting of alternating layers of ploy(lactide-co-glycolide) and vancomycin. TOF-SIMS imaging clarified that the two chemicals can undergo phase separation when dimethyl sulfoxide is used as the solvent. The authors identified two diagnostic ions that are abundant and structural moieties of vancomycin. The results on TOF-SIMS imaging and depth profiling vancomycin provide useful information for further applications of TOF-SIMS in the development of antibiotic drug delivery systems involving the use of vancomycin.",

        "abstract": "Hyaluronan (HA) microgels with different crosslink network, i.e. HGPs-1, HGPs-1.5, HGPs-3, HGPs-6 and HGPs-15, were synthesized using divinyl sulfone (DVS) as the crosslinker in an inverse microemulsion system for controlling the sustained delivery of bovine serum albumin (BSA). With increasing the crosslinker content, the average particle size slightly increased from 1.9 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcm to 3.6 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcm by dynamic laser scattering analysis. However, the crosslinker content had no significant effect on the morphology of HA microgels by scanning and transmission electron microscopes. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and elemental analysis proved more sulfur participated in the crosslink reaction when raising the crosslinker amount. The water swelling test confirmed the increasing crosslink density with the crosslinker content by calculating the average molecular weight between two crosslink points to be 8.25 \u00b1 2.51 \u00d7 10(5), 1.26 \u00b1 0.43 \u00d7 10(5), 0.96 \u00b1 0.09 \u00d7 10(5), 0.64 \u00b1 0.03 \u00d7 10(5), and 0.11 \u00b1 0.01 \u00d7 10(5) respectively. The degradation of HA microgels by hyaluronidase slowed down by enhancing the crosslink density, only about 5% of HGPs-15 was degraded as opposed to over 90% for HGPs-1. BSA loading had no obvious influence on the surface morphology of HA microgels but seemed to induce their aggregation. The increase of crosslink density decreased the BSA loading capacity but facilitated its long-term sustained delivery. When the molar ratio of DVS to repeating unit of HA reached 3 or higher, similar delivery profiles were obtained. Among all these HA microgels, HGPs-3 was the optimal carrier for BSA sustained delivery in this system because it possessed both high BSA loading capacity and long-term delivery profile simultaneously.",

The photo-crosslinking reaction of PCCs-GMA with different degree of substitution (DS) of GMA allowed the formation of biomimetic hydrogels with tunable mechanical and swelling properties. Cold crystallization behaviors ascribed to their restrained freezing bound water were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The rheological and swelling behaviors, hemolysis as well as protein sorption of PCCs-GMA hydrogels were investigated in terms of the DS of GMA, using fibrinogen, bovine serum albumin and lysozyme as model proteins. Low irreversible protein sorption and non hemolytic results indicated that photo-crosslinked PCCs-GMA hydrogels may offer a promising candidate material with resistance to protein fouling in biomedical applications.

        "abstract": "Loading antibiotics in a biodegradable polymer matrix is an excellent way to control its release kinetics, which eliminates side effects caused by conventional administrations of the drug. This approach is especially beneficial for bone regeneration when using a scaffold made of a biodegradable polymer loaded with drug agents capable of controllable releases. In this case, the scaffold serves as a mechanical support to tissue formation and the drug agents may provide biomolecules to assist the tissue formation and/or provide antibiotics to prevent tissues from infections. Towards this goal, we have developed an approach to make vancomycin-loaded poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres, from which we made scaffolds by compression molding. In this article we concentrate on characterizing the porosity and drug release profiles, as well as verifying shape-memory effect of the scaffolds. The scaffold was biodegradable and showed a much slower drug release profile than microspheres. We confirmed that our PLGA scaffolds recovered to their permanent shapes when heated to 45\u00b0C. We believe that these scaffolds will find applications in bone regeneration where both the use of antibiotics against infection and accommodation to spatial restrictions may be required.",

        "abstract": "The key factor of scaffold design for bone tissue engineering is to mimic the microenvironment of natural bone extracellular matrix (ECM) and guide cell osteogenic differentiation. The biomineralized fiber-aligned PLGA scaffolds (a-PLGA/CaPs) was developed in this study by mimicking the structure and composition of native bone ECM. The aligned PLGA fibers was prepared by wet spinning and then biomineralized via an alternate immersion method. Introduction of a bioceramic component CaP onto the PLGA fibers led to changes in surface roughness and hydrophilicity, which showed to modulate cell adhesion and cell morphology of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs). It was found that organized actin filaments of UCMSCs cultured on both a-PLGA and a-PLGA/CaP scaffolds appeared to follow contact guidance along the aligned fibers, and those cells grown on a-PLGA/CaP scaffolds exhibited a more polarized cellular morphology. The a-PLGA/CaP scaffold with multicycles of mineralization facilitated the cell attachment on the fiber surfaces and then supported better cell adhesion and contact guidance, leading to enhancement in following proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of UCMSCs. Our results give some insights into the regulation of cell behaviors through design of ECM-mimicking structure and composition and provide an alternative wet-spun fiber-aligned scaffold with HA-mineralized layer for bone tissue engineering application.",

The osteoconductive properties of calcium sulfate may be further improved by doping with strontium ions. Nevertheless, the high degradation rate of calcium sulfate may impede bone healing as substantial material degradation may occur before the healing process is complete. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel composite bone substitute composed of chitosan and strontium-doped \u03b1-calcium sulfate hemihydrate in the form of microcapsules, which can promote osteogenesis while matching the natural rate of bone healing. The developed microcapsules exhibited controlled degradation that facilitated the sustained release of strontium ions. In vitro testing showed that the microcapsules had minimal cytotoxicity and ability to inhibit bacterial growth. In vivo testing in a mouse model showed the absence of genetic toxicity and low inflammatory potential of the microcapsules. The novel microcapsules developed in this study demonstrated suitable degradation characteristics for bone repair as well as favourable in vitro and in vivo behaviour, and hold promise for use as an alternative bone substitute in orthopaedic surgery.

Successful immobilization of GRGDF on the liquid crystalline surface was verified by fluorescent labeling, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). OPC-GA-RGDs retained its liquid crystalline feature after surface modification. The RGD-immobilized OPC substrate was hardly beneficial to initial cell adhesion but could support long-term cell survival. The enhancement in cell proliferation did not correlate with RGD density. The lower GRGDF density immobilized on the liquid crystalline OPC matrix (OPC-GA-RGD3) promoted cell adhesion, proliferation, ALP expression level and mineralization, suggesting that both the viscoelasticity-based mechanical stimuli and receptor/ligand-based biochemical cue synergistically modulate MC3T3-E1 cell behavior.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The extent of substrate stiffness has been shown to be predominant in regulating cellular behaviors. Previous studies have used matrices such as elastomers or hydrogels to understand cell behavior. Herein, liquid crystalline matrices that resemble movable morphology of biomembrane and viscoelasticity were fabricated with tunable storage modulus for the evaluation of the modulus-driven cell behaviors. Our results demonstrated that NIH/3T3 cells showed a hypersensitive response to the storage modulus of liquid crystalline substrates by the alteration in attachment, spreading, proliferation and viability, polarization, cell cycle and apoptosis, and activity of mechano-transduction-related signal molecules including FAK, paxillin and ERK. The octyl hydroxypropyl cellulose substrates (OPC-1-5) with intermediate storage modulus of 12,312\u00a0Pa and 7228\u00a0Pa (OPC-2 and OPC-3 respectively) could provide more beneficial adhesion conditions leading to a larger spreading area, more elongated morphology and higher proliferation rates possibly through paxillin-ERK pathway, whereas the substrates with the highest or lowest storage modulus (16,723\u00a0Pa, OPC-1; and 41\u00a0Pa, OPC-5, respectively) appeared unfavorable for cell growth. Our study provides insights into the mechanism of modulus-driven cellular behaviors for better design of bioengineered cell substrates.",

Thermal analysis revealed that there existed the freezing bound water due to the introduction of PdC and PC groups for both PdC-chitosan and PC-chitosan, implying that double-positively charged PdC-chitosan may exhibit excellent biocompatibility as zwitterionic PC-chitosan. Cytotoxicity, hemolysis and antibacterial activity evidenced that PdC-chitosan displayed high antibacterial activity against  Escherichia coli  and  Staphylococcus aureus  under physiological conditions, and very low cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity, owing to its highly selective lysis of bacterial membranes over mammalian cell membranes mainly resulting from the competition of electrostatic interactions and shielding effect of the restrained water of PdC, while biocompatible PC-chitosan showed no antibacterial activity due to its non-fouling property. The results indicated that biocompatible double-positively charged PdC-containing bioinspired polymers may provide a promising approach for developing safe and effective antibacterial agents.",

Bovine serum albumin was used as a model protein to study protein adsorption, loading and releasing property of these nanogels in vitro. The results indicated that biomimetic PCCs/TPP nanogels can not only restrain the non-specific protein adsorption, improve the hemocompatibility, but also have good loading and releasing protein efficacy, which will be a promising nanocarrier for protein drug delivery.",

Heparin-conjugated hyaluronan microgels after glycidyl methacrylation as reinforcing phase crosslinked with glycidyl-methacrylated hyaluronan as matrix phase by ultraviolet radiation. The morphology, water swelling ratio, rheological property, degradation, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) loading and delivery, and cytotoxicity were characterized. Increasing heparin content enhanced the loading and sustainable delivery of BMP-2, but partly attenuated the mechanical property of DCH that presented a much higher elastic modulus than bulk gel. The incorporation of heparin and dually crosslinked network was harmless to the good cytocompatibility of hyaluronan hydrogel.",

This work presents the development of a novel biodegradable cationic polymer with specific associated water structure and unique interactions with biocomponents. Bioinspired branched dicationically-charged phosphodicholine-chitosan (PdCCs) with different substitute degree were synthesized via Atherton-Todd reaction. As compared with monocationically charged  N -(2-hydroxyl) propyl-3-trimethyl ammonium chitosan chloride (HTCC), thermal analysis confirmed the existence of the freezing bound water surrounding PdCCs due to the introduction of branched dicationically-charged PdC moiety. Fluorescence spectra revealed that PdCCs induced much less conformational change of bovine serum albumin than HTCC. Antibacterial and hemolysis assay showed that PdCCs and HTCC displayed high antibacterial activities against  Escherichia coli  and  Staphylococcus aureus  with different bacterial-type selectivity, and PdCCs showed higher selectivity to kill bacteria over red blood cell than HTCC. Furthermore, PdCCs-immobilized antibacterial surfaces exhibited better hydrophilicity and less protein adsorption than HTCC-immobilized antibacterial surfaces. These results indicated that branched dicationic PdC with capacity to restrain the freezing bound water may provide a good choice for developing cationic polymers for therapeutic applications.",

By carefully tuning the concentration of the reactants, reaction time and pressure, a series of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanocuboids, nanospheres, nanosheets, nanorods and nanowires can be obtained. Based on the evidence of electron microscope images, a formation mechanism for nanowire-structured hematite is proposed. The electrochemical performance of these hematite nanostructures as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries was further evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance and charge\u2013discharge measurements. It was demonstrated that both the morphology and the particle size have an influence on the performance. The results showed that the nanospheres displayed the highest discharge capacity and superior cycling reversibility, which may result from the high surface area and small and uniform grain size.",

X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) make it clear that the film is amorphous. X-Ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) indicates that the 3D grid is composed of SnO2 and CoO. As an anode for the lithium ion battery, the film has 1240.2 mAh/g of initial discharge capacity, shows a gradually increasing capacity after the first cycle, and has 845 mAh/g of discharge capacity up to the 50th cycle. The high porosity of the 3D reticular structure can provide more reaction sites on the electrode surface and accommodate volume variation of Sn particles during Li alloying-dealloying. The CoO in the complex composite film plays an important role, allowing the formation of a polymeric gel-like film to improve its electrochemical performance, preventing Sn aggregation during charging and discharging. Such a composite film can be used as an anode for lithium ion batteries with higher energy densities. \u00a9 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "Co3O4 mesoporous nanowires with average single crystalline grain sizes of about 8 nm, 12nm, 25 nm, and 45 nm were synthesized by sintering of microwave-assisted hydrothermal processed belt-Co(OH) 2 precursors at 300-500 \u00b0C for 2 h. Microstructure analysis was conducted by x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field emission SEM (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) to confirm the composition, structure, and orientation in the nanowires. Systematic magnetic measurements have also been conducted on the nanowires. It was found that the size and orientation have significant effects on the magnetic and exchange bias properties. The interesting finding was made that room temperature ferromagnetism appeared at 350 \u00b0C in the high orientation samples. Systematic comparison and analysis of the relationships among the grain size, microstructure, orientation (texture), surface electric structure (O vacancies), and defects with magnetic properties (ferromagnetism, coercive field, exchange bias, etc.) are presented in this work. \u00a9 2011 American Institute of Physics.",

We found that the highly (100)-oriented thin films possess not only excellent dielectric and ferroelectric properties but also a large electrocaloric effect (13.4 K at 15 V, i.e., 0.89 K/V) which is attributed to the large electric field-induced polarization and entropy change during the ferroelectric\u2013paraelectric phase transition. The experimental results indicate that the use of PZT/PbO x buffer layer can induce the crystal orientation and phase purity of the PMN\u2013PT thin films, and consequently enhance their electrical properties. Keywords Lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate Thin films Buffer layer Lead zirconate titanate Electrocaloric effect Sputtering 1 Introduction The electrocaloric (EC) effect of ferroelectric materials is attractive because it may provide a very efficient approach to realize solid-state cooling devices instead of the existing vapor-compression refrigeration [1\u20134] . However, the electrocaloric materials have not been exploited commercially, as the EC effect was small and insufficient for practical applications due to the limit on high electric field in these bulk materials. The recent discovery of a large EC effect in thin film PbZr 0.95 Ti 0.05 O 3 and relaxor-based ferroelectric 0.9PbMg 1/3 Nb 2/3 O 3 \u20130.1PbTiO 3 thin film has stimulated much interest in this subject [5,6] . After that, the large EC effect was successively observed in some ceramic and polymer films [7\u201311] . Considerable effort has been devoted to the discovery of materials displaying excellent EC effect. A few theoretical reports of this phenomenon can also be found in the literature. Akcay et al. [12,13] showed directly by thermodynamic analysis that these giant EC effects as observed in thin film perovskites can be attributed to their intrinsic, monodomain thermodielectric properties. Dai et al. [14] investigated the influence of thermal strains on the electrocaloric and dielectric properties of ferroelectric nanoshells using the modified Landau\u2013Ginzburg\u2013Devonshire theory. Generally, to achieve large EC effect, a large field-induced polarization change and considerably small hysteresis loss in ferroelectric materials is essential [5,7] . Ferroelectric materials (1 \u2212 x )PbMg 1/3 Nb 2/3 O 3 \u2013 x PbTiO 3 (PMN\u2013PT) with the compositions near the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) (0.30 < x < 0.35), are promising for high-strain actuators/transducers and prototype microelectro-mechanical systems due to their excellent known ferroelectric, dielectric, and piezoelectric properties [15\u201317] . However, the electrocaloric effect of PMN\u2013PT thin films near the MPB still has not been well studied. Many efforts have been done to eliminate the pyrochlore phase and to improve the crystallinity during the growth process of PMN\u2013PT thin films in order to achieve the enhanced properties. Nevertheless, highly oriented or epitaxial PMN\u2013PT thin films have unique and often better properties than those with random orientation. It is known that electrical properties of ferroelectric films are dependent on many condition parameters, such as the composition, the preferential orientation, the buffer layer, and so on. Among these, the buffer layer plays an important role in the crystal orientation and electrical properties of the films [18] . In the present work, to achieve the preferential crystal orientation and excellent ferroelectric hysteretic character, 0.68PMN\u20130.32PT thin films were deposited on a Pb(Zr 0.3 Ti 0.7 )O 3 (PZT)/PbO x buffer layer by radio frequency (rf) magnetron sputtering technique. As will be seen in the following, we found that the ferroelectric thin films with a highly (100)-preferred orientation possess not only excellent dielectric and ferroelectric properties and but also a large electrocaloric effect near the Curie temperature. 2 Experimental details To grow pure perovskite phase (with no pyrochlore phase) of PMN\u2013PT, a PZT/PbO x buffer layer of 50 nm in thickness was first deposited on a Pt/TiO 2 /SiO 2 /Si substrate from a sintered PZT/PbO x ceramic target by rf magnetron sputtering (Leybold UNIVEX450B), respectively, and then a 0.68PMN\u20130.32PT thin film of 200 nm in thickness was deposited from a sintered 0.68PMN\u20130.32PT ceramic target under the same conditions with a substrate temperature of 600 \u00b0C. Sputtering was carried out at a power of 2.5 W/cm 2 with a high purity gas composed of 20%O 2 + 80%Ar under a working pressure of 2.0 Pa. The PZT/PbO x ceramic target was prepared by a conventional mixing-oxides method and the PMN\u2013PT ceramic target was prepared using columbite process to obtain pure perovskite phase [19] . The crystallographic properties of the films were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Philips X'Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer) in the mode of \u03b8\u20132\u03b8 scan using Cu K\u03b1 radiation. For electrical measurements, Au dots 0.5 mm in diameter deposited on the surface of the thin film through a shadow mask by e-beam were used as top electrodes. The dielectric constant and loss tangent were measured using a HP4192A impedance analyzer at different frequencies. Electrical hysteresis loops ( P\u2013E ) for every 10 \u00b0C interval from room temperature to 160 \u00b0C were collected on a Precision Premier workstation (Radiant Technologies, Inc) at a frequency of 100 Hz. 3 Result and discussion Fig.\u00a01 shows the XRD patterns of the PZT/PbO x buffer layer and the 0.68PMN\u20130.32PT thin film with PZT/PbO x buffer layer. It displays that the MPB PMN\u2013PT film possessed pure perovskite structure (no pyrochlore phase), and a preferred highly (100) orientation, different from the random polycrystalline structure of the MPB PMN\u2013PT films directly deposited on Pt/TiO 2 /SiO 2 /Si substrates by rf magnetron sputtering [20] . These results indicate that the PZT/PbO x buffer layer not only improve the crystallographic structure of PMN\u2013PT films but also eliminate the pyrochlore phase. For phase structure of the MPB region (0.30 < x < 0.35) in the (1\u2212 x )PMN\u2013 x PT system, was reported to be momoclinic Pm phase by Singh et al. [15] and Noheda et al. [21] . The X-ray diffraction data in this work also seems to support the MPB 0.68PMN\u20130.32PT thin film with the monoclinic phase. The dielectric constant and loss for the 0.68PMN\u20130.32PT thin film as a function of temperature at different frequencies are shown in Fig.\u00a02 . The thin films show the excellent dielectric properties with the relative dielectric constant \u03b5 33 T / \u03b5 0 = 1380 and loss tangent tan\u03b4 = 1.8% at 1 kHz at room temperature, attributed to its highly (100)-oriented texture. Frequency dispersion behavior of the permittivity could barely be observed in the thin film in the temperature range from room temperature to 175 \u00b0C. This indicates a normal ferroelectric state with less relaxor behavior. One peak is observed at ~ 146 \u00b0C, which is the Curie temperature T C of the monoclinic (ferroelectric) to cubic (paraelectric) phase transition, close to the T C (~ 150 \u00b0C) in the 0.68PMN\u20130.32PT ceramics [21] and crystals [22] of the same composition. Fig.\u00a03 shows representative curves depicting the change of hysteresis loops in the 0.68PMN\u20130.32PT thin film depending on temperature at 600 kV/cm (15 V). Good ferroelectric properties with a high remanent polarization Pr (19 \u03bcC/cm 2 ) and a low coercive field E c (53 kV/cm) are achieved in the ferroelectric thin film near room temperature. The polarization of the thin film decreases with increasing temperature. Meanwhile, high temperature makes the loops thinner and decreases the coercive field. The gradual decrease in the polarization and the coercive field of the ferroelectric thin film is an indication of the microdomain state of the ferroelectric material near the Curie temperature. Assuming the Maxwell relation (\u2202 P /\u2202 T ) E = (\u2202 S /\u2202 E ) T , the reversible adiabatic temperature change, \u0394T , for a dielectric material caused by an applied electric field E is given [5,7] by the following equation: (1) \u0394 T = \u2212 T C \u03c1 \u222b E 1 E 2 ( \u2202 P \u2202 T ) E d E , where \u03c1 is the mass density of the material, C is the heat capacity, and E 1 and E 2 are the initial and final applied electric field, respectively. For the ferroelectric 0.68PMN\u20130.32PT thin film,(\u2202 P /\u2202 T ) E can be obtained from fourth-order polynomial fits to the P(T) data, which are extracted from the hysteresis loops at different temperatures (as shown in the inset of Fig.\u00a04 ). In the temperature range of interest, the heat capacity is assumed to be a constant value of C = 110 J mol \u22121 K \u22121 for the PMN\u2013PT material, in spite of a fluctuation of ~ 10% or even decreases at low temperatures [23] . The mass density of \u03c1 = 8.01 g cm \u22123 is also obtained from the literature [23] . Since no antiferroelectric to ferroelectric phase transition exists in PMN\u2013PT throughout the temperature range of interest, there is no need to avoid the antiferroelectric regime. Hence, E 1 can be set as low as zero, which is sufficient to ensure the criterion \u2202 P /\u2202 T < 0. Conservatively, E 2 was set here as a maximum electric field of 600 kV cm \u22121 , in order to avoid breakdown of the thin film. Therefore, EC temperature changes \u0394T in the 0.68PMN\u20130.32PT thin film can be obtained using Eq.\u00a0 (2) from a series of curves with different lower integration limits. Fig.\u00a04 in the form of \u0394 T\u2013T curves shows the EC effect in 0.68PMN\u20130.32PT thin film under different applied field shifts, \u0394 E , defined as E 1 \u2212 E 2 . The peak of \u0394 T is observed near the Curie point of 146 \u00b0C, which indicates that the ferroelectric\u2013paraelectric phase transition contributes greatly to large EC effect. The EC temperature change \u0394T increases with increasing \u0394 E . The largest EC temperature change of \u0394 T = 13.4 K (i.e., 0.89 K/V) is observed under an external voltage shift of 15 V (i.e., \u0394 E = 600 kV/cm). Such a large EC effect in the ferroelectric thin film 0.68PMN\u20130.32PT near the MPB is mainly attributed to the large electric field-induced polarization and entropy change during the ferroelectric\u2013paraelectric phase transition [5,7] . When the temperature is far away the Curie temperature, the polarization and entropy change with increasing temperature is not very noticeable, so the EC temperature change \u0394 T is small. When the temperature rises to close to T C , large polarization and entropy change is induced by an external strong electric field during the ferroelectric\u2013paraelectric phase transition, so \u0394 T becomes large. When the temperature is above and far from T C , due to the presence of only paraelectric phase, the small polarization and entropy change with rising temperature decreases \u0394 T sharply. This is why a large EC effect and the peak of \u0394 T occur near the Curie temperature, as shown in Fig.\u00a04 . It should be noted that the use of reversible thermodynamics (Eq.\u00a0 (2) ) to determine the EC effect of ferroelectric thin films is inaccurate unless their hysteresis losses are relatively small and taken into account. For the ferroelectric thin film 0.68PMN\u20130.32PT, its corresponding hysteresis loss near the Curie temperature T C is very small (about 2%) and has the potential to reduce the EC temperature change by only about 0.3 K, not very noticeable compared to the peak \u0394 T . Here it is noted that although large EC effect (13.4 K at 15 V) in the high-quality MPB PMN\u2013PT thin film was achieved near its Curie temperature T C (146 \u00b0C), high temperature is a limit for their potential practical application. Therefore, it is essential to further explore high-performance room temperature EC materials. 4 Conclusions In summary, we investigated the properties of highly (100)-oriented 0.68PMN\u20130.32PT thin film deposited on a PZT/PbO x buffer layer, and found that the high-quality MPB thin film possesses not only excellent dielectric and ferroelectric properties but also a large electrocaloric effect (13.4 K at 15 V) induced by the ferroelectric\u2013paraelectric phase transition at high electric field. The experimental results demonstrate that using appropriate buffer layer can improve the quality of ferroelectric thin films, and enhance their electrical properties including electrocaloric performance.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we have reported a simple and rapid approach for the large-scale synthesis of \u03b2-Co(OH) 2 nanoplatelets via the microwave hydrothermal process using potassium hydroxide as mineralizer at 140 \u00b0C for 3 h. Calcining the \u03b2-Co(OH) 2 nanoplatelets at 350 \u00b0C for 2 h, porous Co 3 O 4 nanoplatelets with a 3D quasi-single-crystal framework were obtained. The process of converting the \u03b2-Co(OH) 2 nanoplatelets into the Co 3 O 4 nanoplatelets is a self-supported topotactic transformation, which is easily controlled by varying the calcining temperature. The textural characteristics of Co 3 O 4 products have strong positive effects on their electrochemical properties as electrode materials in lithium-ion batteries. The obtained porous Co 3 O 4 nanoplatelets exhibit a low initial irreversible loss (18.1%), ultrahigh capacity, and excellent cyclability. For example, a reversible capacity of 900 mAh g \u22121 can be maintained after 100 cycles. Keywords Co 3 O 4 nanoplatelets Porous Self-supported formation Textural characteristics Electrochemical properties 1 Introduction As a new class of negative electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries, transition metal oxides (Co 3 O 4 in particular), as proposed in 2000 [1] , can, in principle, deliver as high as three times the capacity of the currently used graphite (<372 mAh g \u22121 ). However, achieving high lithium storage capacity, high Coulombic efficiency, and long cycling life is still the major challenge for designing electrode materials for rechargeable lithium batteries [1\u20133] . Nanostructured Co 3 O 4 , with a high surface area and enhanced electrochemical reactivity, is particularly attractive for application in lithium-ion batteries. However, there are some controversies regarding the electrochemical properties, particularly the capacity retention of Co 3 O 4 with microcrystalline and nanocrystalline particles, although most reports believed that the capacity retention was worsen with decreasing the particle size, due to severe particle aggregation leads to degraded electrical contact between particles [4\u20136] . Therefore, the electrochemical performance of Co 3 O 4 with special textural characteristics, especially, one-dimensional (1D) porous Co 3 O 4 nanotubes and nanowires/nanorods has recently been widely explored using various template-synthesis methods [7\u201310] . As reported, the electrochemical properties of nanostructured Co 3 O 4 are highly dependent on not only its size and morphology but also its textural characteristics. In this investigation, we prepared porous Co 3 O 4 nanoplatelets with a three-dimensional (3D) framework utilizing a simple solid-state crystal re-construction from the as-prepared \u03b2-Co(OH) 2 nanoplatelets, without the need for a template or structure-directing agent. In the present strategy porous nanostructures were generated from intrinsic crystal conversion. The prepared porous Co 3 O 4 nanoplatelets exhibit superior electrochemical performance compared to the reported 1D Co 3 O 4 nanotubes and nanowires/nanorods, suggesting their potential use as negative electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries. The possible mechanisms governing the formation of the different nanostructures are discussed in this paper. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials preparation All the reagents used in the experiment were analytically pure. First, cobalt hydroxide nanoplatelets were prepared by a precipitation and microwave hydrothermal process. The experimental details are as follows: 10 mmol Co(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O was dissolved in 50 ml distilled water under stirring. Then, 2 M KOH solution was introduced into the above-mentioned solution at a rate of 2 ml min \u22121 , until the pH value of the solution reached 11. After 30 min stirring, the milky solution was then transferred into a double-walled vessel, which has an inner liner and a cover made of Teflon PFA and an outer high strength sleeve. The vessel was sealed and maintained in a Microwave Accelerated Reaction System (MARS-5, CEM Corporation, USA) at 140 \u00b0C for 3 h. The system was operated at a 2.45 GHz with a maximum power of 1200 W. The system can be controlled by temperature (maximum, 300 \u00b0C) and pressure (maximum, 10 MPa). After the reaction was complete, the resultant black precipitates were centrifuged, washed with distilled water and then ethanol to minimize the extra ions in the final products, and dried at 80 \u00b0C in air. Finally, the powders were calcinated at 350 \u00b0C and 500 \u00b0C in air for 2 h, respectively. 2.2 Materials characterization The thermal behaviors of the precursor were examined using simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (METTLER TOLEDO, Australia). The measurements were performed at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 from room temperature to 600 \u00b0C in air. The morphology and structure of the as-prepared samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, GBC MMA, Cu K\u03b1 radiation, 40 kV, 25 mA), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL JSM7500FA, 15 kV), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (JEOL 2011F, 200 kV). Specific surface area and pore structure were determined by gas adsorption on ASAP 2020 (Micromeritics Inc., USA). 2.3 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical measurements were carried out via CR2032 coin-type cell with lithium metal as the counter and reference electrodes at room temperature. The working electrode consisted of 70 wt% active material (the as-prepared Co 3 O 4 ), 15 wt% carbon black and 15 wt% polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF). The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF 6 in a 1:2 (v/v) mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC). Cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box (Mbraun, Germany). Charge\u2013discharge cycles were measured between 0.01 V and 3.0 V at a constant current density of 50 mA g \u22121 on a Land CT2001A Cycler. The cyclic voltammetries (CV) of the cells were conducted at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s \u22121 using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660C). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out on a PARSTAT 2273. The morphology and structure of the electrode materials after 30 cycles were characterized by TEM (JEOL 2011F, 200 kV). 3 Results and discussion Based on the thermogavimetric analysis (TGA\u2013DSC) data (see Fig. S1 in Supplementary Information ), two different nano-Co 3 O 4 samples were prepared by annealing the precursor \u03b2-Co(OH) 2 nanoplatelets at 350 \u00b0C and 500 \u00b0C for 2 h in air, hereinafter they are designated as S350 and S500, respectively. XRD patterns in Fig. 1 a show that the precursor processed by microwave irradiation consists of hexagonal \u03b2-Co(OH) 2 and cubic Co 3 O 4 . The brucite-like \u03b2-Co(OH) 2 (JCPDS card no. 30-0443, hexagonal crystal, space group: P-3m1, a = 3.183 \u00c5, c = 4.652 \u00c5) was the predominant phase, plus a small amount of spinel Co 3 O 4 (JCPDS card no. 74-2120, cubic crystal, space group: Fd 3 \u00af m , a = 8.084 \u00c5). The small mount of Co 3 O 4 was formed from the reaction between the \u03b2-Co(OH) 2 and the dissolved oxygen in the solution during the microwave hydrothermal process, as shown below: 6Co(OH) 2 ( s ) + O 2 ( aq ) \u2192 2Co 3 O 4 ( s ) + 6H 2 O ( l ) Fig. 1 b shows the XRD patterns of the samples S350 and S500, and the peaks in the two XRD spectra are identical and can be perfectly indexed as cubic spinel Co 3 O 4 phase. As expected, with increasing calcination temperature, the crystallinity of the calcined product is improved significantly, as suggested by the increased peak intensities. The FESEM images of the precursor (shown in Fig. 2 ) show the precursor is mainly composed of \u03b2-Co(OH) 2 platelets together with some Co 3 O 4 particles adhering to the surface of the platelets. Most platelets have an approximately hexagonal morphology with a thickness of 20\u201330 nm and an edge length between 100 and 200 nm. The morphologies and structures of the Co 3 O 4 resultants after the calcinations were characterized by FESEM and TEM. From Fig. 3 a , it can be seen that the size and shape of the Co 3 O 4 in S350 are similar to those of the \u03b2-Co(OH) 2 precursor. Fig. 3 b clearly shows that the Co 3 O 4 nanoplatelets are porous, which is different from that of the \u03b2-Co(OH) 2 nanoplatelets. They very much resemble elegant chased jade platelets. The porous nature of the Co 3 O 4 nanoplatelet is further confirmed by TEM as shown in Fig. 3 c. The porous hexagon has regular edges with an angle of 120\u00b0 between adjacent sides and the length of each side is about 110 nm. In fact that the porous hexagonal platelet is made of many connected nano-Co 3 O 4 single crystals. The inset in Fig. 3 c is the corresponding electron diffraction (ED) pattern of the Co 3 O 4 platelet. As it can be seen that the ED pattern of the hexagonal Co 3 O 4 platelet is the same as that from a single fcc crystal in [1 1 1], which indicates that the nanocrystals within the Co 3 O 4 platelet are highly textured and their {1 1 1} planes are parallel to the hexagonal plane of the platelet, i.e. the dominant exposed planes of the Co 3 O 4 platelet are {1 1 1}. Clearly the porous and highly textured Co 3 O 4 platelet is transformed from the hexagonal \u03b2-Co(OH) 2 platelet by the nucleation and growth of the multiple Co 3 O 4 crystals within the \u03b2-Co(OH) 2 . The growth of the Co 3 O 4 crystals is stopped by the impingements and results in numerous mesopores within the hexagonal platelet. In addition to the porous hexagonal Co 3 O 4 platelets there are also small amount of equi-axed nano-Co 3 O 4 particles with a size of 10\u201320 nm. The corner of the Co 3 O 4 nanoplatelet was further characterized by HRTEM as shown in Fig. 3 d. The lattice fringes of the equi-axed Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles adhered on the outer surface of a Co 3 O 4 platelet are clearly resolved corresponding to (1 1 1) planes with a lattice spacing of 0.47 nm, however, the fringes of the Co 3 O 4 nanoplatelet are not resolved because of the smaller lattice spacing of 0.143 nm for (440) planes. This further reveals that the nanoplatelets grow in an oriented manner to form an integrated porous architecture with interesting combined properties of porosity and quasi-single-crystallinity. Fig. 4 a shows a FESEM image of S500 calcined at 500 \u00b0C for 2 h. With pronounced thermal re-crystallization, the morphology of the Co 3 O 4 in S500 has changed significantly from the porous hexagonal platelets of S350 to hollow Co 3 O 4 rings. The Co 3 O 4 particles (40\u201350 nm) of S500 are also significantly coarser than that (10\u201320 nm) of S350. Furthermore, both Co 3 O 4 rings and particles of S500 have smooth surfaces. The S500 was further observed by TEM ( Fig. 4 b). The inset of Fig. 4 b shows the morphology of a typical individual ring and particle. Fig. 4 c and d are the HRTEM images of the inner site A and outside site B of the hollow ring as marked in Fig. 4 b. The corresponding ED patterns clearly reveal that the inner and outer surfaces of the ring have different crystallized orientations. The different porosity of S350 and S500 is also revealed by the representative N 2 absorption/desorption isotherms and the corresponding Barret\u2013Joyner\u2013Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution curves shown in Fig. S2 . Based on the observations above, Fig. 5 schematically illustrates the self-supported transformation process from the \u03b2-Co(OH) 2 hexagonal platelets to the porous Co 3 O 4 hexagonal platelets at 350 \u00b0C and then to Co 3 O 4 rings at 500 \u00b0C. It is well known that the brucite-like \u03b2-Co(OH) 2 has a layered structure comprised of sheets of hexagonally close-packed OH ions with Co(II) bonded to the six OH. The sheets are parallel to the (0 0 1) plane. These Co(OH) 2 sheets are bonded to one-another by weak OH\u2013OH dipole interactions. Therefore, brucite crystals have the tendency to grow into thin hexagonal nanoplatelets [11] . Co 3 O 4 has a cubic spinel structure containing Co 3+ in an octahedral coordination and Co 2+ in a tetrahedral coordination, therefore Co 3 O 4 has a tendency to grow into polyhedrons [12] . However considering the very similar d -spacing between the spinel Co 3 O 4 (1 1 1) planes (4.667 \u00c5) and the brucite \u03b2-Co(OH) 2 (0 0 1) planes (4.653 \u00c5), the transformation preferably occurs from the \u03b2-Co(OH) 2 (0 0 1) planes to Co 3 O 4 (1 1 1) planes, and therefore at 350 \u00b0C the Co 3 O 4 preserved the original morphology and size of the \u03b2-Co(OH) 2 hexagonal platelets. The \u03b2-Co(OH) 2 -to-Co 3 O 4 transition is known as a topotactic transformation [13\u201317] . At the higher calcination temperature of 500 \u00b0C, initially the same porous hexagonal Co 3 O 4 platelets and equi-axed nano-Co 3 O 4 particles are formed as those observed in sample S350. As the calcination proceeds the coalescence of the mesopores within the hexagonal Co 3 O 4 platelets results in the Co 3 O 4 rings and the nanoparticles are coarsened into polyhedral Co 3 O 4 particles. The hollow nature of the Co 3 O 4 ring might be caused by the Kirkendall effect, in which an inward flow of vacancies, balancing the outward transport of fast-moving cations, can condense into voids at the centre of the ring [18] . The driving force for the morphological change and particle coarsening of the Co 3 O 4 is from the reduction of surface energy. The electrochemical performances of the as-prepared Co 3 O 4 products was evaluated by a standard method based on Co 3 O 4 /Li half cells, where the Co 3 O 4 and lithium foil serve as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. Fig. 6 shows the cycling performances of the electrodes made from S350 and S500 at a current density of 50 mA g \u22121 (equivalent to 1 Li per formula unit in 2.2 h), which is commonly used in the energy materials community for testing Co 3 O 4 /Li. For S350 and S500, the first discharge capacities are 1183 mAh g \u22121 and 1123 mAh g \u22121 respectively. The initial Coulombic efficiency of S350 was 81.9%, i.e. the porous Co 3 O 4 nanoplateletes have an irreversible loss of only 18.1%, which is probably the lowest loss for Co 3 O 4 reported so far. More importantly, for S350, after the initial decrease, the reversible capacity gradually increases to an ultrahigh value of \u223c1350 mAh g \u22121 over the first 30 cycles. After that, this capacity gradually decreases to the initial value, and the reversible capacity of 900 mAh g \u22121 can be maintained after 100 cycles that is not still lower than the theoretical capacity (dotted line). The capacity of S350 is twice that of the large-sized multilayered Co 3 O 4 platelets reported by Yao et al. [19] , even higher than those of the Co 3 O 4 nanotubes and nanowires mentioned in the introduction. Not unexpected that the cycling performance of S500 is significantly different from that of S350, although their first discharge capacities are similar. The initial Coulombic efficiency of S500 was only 66.1%, and the capacity rapidly fades to about 300 mAh g \u22121 over the first 10 cycles. The significantly different cycling performances of S350 and S500 indicate that the electrochemical properties of Co 3 O 4 are extremely sensitive to its size and structure. To understand the electrochemical process and this difference in behavior, cyclic voltammograms (CV) of the S350 electrode and S500 electrode for the first, second and the 5th cycle were recorded and are compared in Fig. 7 . In the first cycle, there are two reduction peaks including one weak shoulder peak at 1.2 V and another strong peak at 0.9 V and one oxidation peak at 2.1 V for both S350 and S500. The two reduction peaks are generally attributed to the reduction of the Co 3 O 4 to CoO (or Li x Co 3 O 4 ) and metallic Co, respectively, accompanying the oxidation of metallic Li. The oxidation peak is mainly attributed to the oxidation of metallic Co accompanying with the decomposition of Li 2 O [20] . The whole conversion reaction of Li with Co 3 O 4 can be written as follows: C o 3 O 4 + 8 L i + + 8 e \u2212 \u21c4 Recharging Discharging 4 L i 2 O + 3 Co , \u2003 which has a theoretical capacity of 890 \u2009 mAh \u2009 g \u2212 1 . For S350, the main reduction peak shifts to a higher potential at 1.1 V in the subsequent cycles. This might be related to the pulverization of the Co 3 O 4 [21] . A shoulder reduction peak at 0.6 V and a shoulder oxidation peak at 2.4 V appear in the subsequent cycles, indicating that another reversible redox reaction accompanies with the reaction between Li and Co 3 O 4 . This is attributed to the formation and decomposition of the polymer layer on the surface of the active material. The gradually increased capacity up to 1350 mAh g \u22121 over the first 30 cycles is likely to be due to the contribution of the polymer layer. The existence of higher than theoretical specific capacity in Co 3 O 4 has also been observed and reported before [22,23] , and it is plausibly attributed to the reversible growth of a Li-bearing polymeric layer on the surface of the active material, resulting from electrolyte degradation. The above results show that the porous Co 3 O 4 platelets have extremely high electrochemical activity, which is probably due to the nano-Co 3 O 4 particles are rigidly confined within the hexagonal platelets and they are prevented from agglomeration and lithium ions are readily accessible from the electrolyte due to the mesopores within the hexagonal Co 3 O 4 platelets. Both the reversible formation of Li 2 O, which is known to be electrochemically inactive in bulk, and the reversible formation of the polymer layer catalyzed by cobalt or cobalt oxide nanoparticles can occur. It is well known that both nanosized metallic cobalt and cobalt oxide are excellent catalysts [24\u201327] . It should be noted that the shoulder peaks, corresponding to polymer layer formation and decomposition for S350, could not be observed in the CV curves for S500, furthermore, the reduction peak in the 5th cycle obviously shifts to a lower potential at 0.8 V, indicating an increase in the cell polarization that leads to the incompletely reversible redox reaction between Li and Co 3 O 4 , which causes the capacity to rapidly fade during cycling. The increase in the cell polarization for S500 is further confirmed by the electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) measured before and after 5 cycles on the same electrode (see Fig. S2 in Supplementary Information ). The difference in electrochemical behavior of the porous Co 3 O 4 nanoplatelets (S350) and the dense polyhedral Co 3 O 4 rings or particles (S500) is further explained by the discharge/charge profiles in Fig. 8 . From the discharge profiles, it is clear that capacities are mainly from two sections, the long plateau region (corresponding to the redox conversion reaction between Li and Co 3 O 4 ) and the sequent sloping region (corresponding to the surface layer formation). The first discharge curves for S350 and S500 are similar, due to undergoing the resemble initial conversion reaction, so their first discharge capacities are both approximate 1200 mAh g \u22121 . However, the sequent cycles for S350 and S500 are significant different. For S500, 1st, 2nd and 30th discharge/charge curves show that the electrochemical reactions appear the poor reversible, for the 30th cycle, the plateau reaction almost ceases, and so that the discharge capacity is not more than 200 mAh g \u22121 . For S350, 1st, 2nd, 30th and 60th discharge/charge curves indicate that the redox conversion reaction and the surface layer formation in the cycles are reversible, so the porous Co 3 O 4 nanoplatelets exhibit an ultrahigh reversible capacity. In early cycles, more and more polymer layer formation makes the capacity gradually increase, for the 30th cycle the capacity is up to the maximum, thereafter the capacity gradually decreases due to little irreversible conversion, after the 60th cycle the capacity tends to be stable, so the capacity retention appears the semi-circle-type feature. We propose that the higher surface areas of the porous nanoplatelets, permits, on cycling, an increase in the extent of polymer layer formation per on the surface of active materials. The gradual increase of the excess capacity over the first 30 cycles is consistent with the proposal, that not all the surface layer is covered on the first discharge, or the internal surface within the pores are more difficult to access, so it appears that the polymer layer builds up slowly, over a number of cycles. The polymer layers that have been intensively studied turn out to form from a multistep degradation mechanism including electrochemical and chemical processes [28] . Moreover, the excess reversible capacity in the sloped region has also been explained in terms of a heterogeneous interfacial storage mechanism [29,30] , where excess lithium is accommodated at the Co/Li 2 O interface which is formed in the course of the heterogeneous solid-state reaction. Examining the TEM data for S350 and S500 after 30 cycles in Fig. S4 authenticates our proposal. The TEM data for the porous nanoplatelets (S350) after 30 cycles demonstrates that the porous hexagonal nanoplatelet structure has disappeared, to be replaced by a nano-composite structure, the active particles with an average size of 3 nm are surrounded by a polymer layer. Such a polymeric layer is found to be beneficial to the cell cyclability, because it acts as an envelope holding the nanoparticles together furthermore, the active particles appear amorphous and well dispersed, so the large capacity of S350 can be maintained for hundreds of cycles. The structures of the cycled S500 is substantially different from S350, the former exhibits more isolated particles than the latter, which is more crystallized, those lead to the electrochemical impedance sharply increases, and hence the conversion reaction does not almost occur and the capacity of S500 rapidly fades. 4 Conclusions In summary, porous Co 3 O 4 nanoplatelets with a 3D quasi-single-crystalline framework were fabricated via simple thermal oxidation decomposition and re-crystallization of the precursor \u03b2-Co(OH) 2 nanoplatelets, which can be synthesized on a large scale by a rapid microwave hydrothermal route. When measured for electrochemical lithium storage, the as-prepared porous Co 3 O 4 nanoplatelets exhibit very low initial irreversible loss, ultrahigh reversible capacity, and excellent capacity retention over 100 cycles. This verifies their promising application as electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries.

Keywords Oxides Nanostructures Chemical synthesis Electrochemical properties 1 Introduction It is vital to increase the charge/discharge rate, as well as the capacity, if lithium batteries are to meet the needs of hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, as well as clean energy storage, such as providing back-up for wind and solar energy [1] . Spinel Co 3 O 4 is an important p-type semiconductor due to its potential applications as a solid-state sensor, a heterogeneous catalyst, in electrochemical devices and energy storage, as a rotatable magnet, etc. It has been investigated as a promising anode material for lithium batteries due to its high capacity (890 mAh g \u22121 ) compared with the commercial graphite (372 mAh g \u22121 ) [2\u20135] . However, its practical applications have been hampered by its poor cyclability and rate capability, which have been largely attributed to the large volume changes during repeated charge and discharge cycles, resulting in local stress and increasing polarization, and eventually leading to electrode failure [6,7] . In an attempt to improve the cyclability, nanoparticulate Co 3 O 4 materials have been investigated, but were found to exhibit considerable fade in their charge storage capacity on cycling, which is due to severe particle aggregation, leading to degraded electrical contact between particles [4,8,9] . Recently, more and more attention has been paid to the control of the morphologies and the microstructures of nanomaterials, because materials with the same compositions but different morphologies and microstructures exhibit substantial differences in properties [10] . There is also growing evidence that nanosized materials with deliberately designed morphology and structure can remarkably improve the electrochemical properties of Li ion batteries. Therefore, the electrochemical performance of Co 3 O 4 with special textural characteristics [6,11] , especially one-dimensional (1-D) porous Co 3 O 4 nanotubes [12\u201314] and nanowires/nanoneedles/nanorods [15\u201320] , has recently been explored using various synthesis methods. There have been only a few reports on the rate capability of Co 3 O 4 nanostructures [19\u201321] . Compared to utilizing soft (surfactants, hydrogel matrices, block copolymers) or hard (preformed mesoporous structures) templates, the strategy without the need for a template or structure-directing agent is more available. It generally involves the synthesis of one-dimensional precursor compounds in the first step, and then the precursor is calcined to produce one-dimensional nanostructured Co 3 O 4 . Therefore, the control of the morphology and composition of the precursor compounds plays a critical role in tailoring the nanostructure of the resultant products. Compared with the conventional precipitation or hydrothermal process, microwave assisted synthesis processes are appealing, as they can offer a short reaction time, higher homogeneity, yield improvement, etc. Microwave irradiation has been successfully applied to the synthesis of nanomaterials with various morphologies [22] . Ref. [23] reported the nanostructured Co 3 O 4 with spherical shape and its electrocatalytic activities which was obtained from the layered cobalt hydrotalcite like compound spheres synthesized by microwave-assisted reflux route. We present here a novel microwave-assisted homogeneous synthesis approach by urea hydrolysis. The dimensions and morphology of the synthesized precursor compounds can be tailored by controlling the temperature and time under microwave irradiation. The wire-like cobalt-basic-carbonate compound was synthesized along the [0 1 0] growth direction (orthorhombic). Upon thermal decomposition at 350 \u00b0C, the above precursor compound self-assembles into one-dimensional porous arrays of Co 3 O 4 nanowires composed of interconnected Co 3 O 4 nanocrystals along the [1 1 0] axis (cubic). The obtained Co 3 O 4 with special nanostructured morphology exhibits excellent capacity retention and rate capability at higher current rates. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials preparation All of the chemical reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification in this experiment. First, the precursor compounds were synthesized by microwave-assisted homogeneous precipitation using urea hydrolysis. The experimental details are as follows: 0.021 mol Co(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O was dissolved in 100 ml distilled water under stirring. Then, 0.168 mol CO(NH 2 ) 2 was introduced into the above-mentioned solution. After 30 min stirring, the solution was then transferred into a double-walled vessel, which has an inner liner and a cover made of Teflon perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) polymer resin and an outer high strength sleeve. The vessel was sealed and kept in a Microwave Accelerated Reaction System (MARS-5, CEM Corporation, USA) at 110 \u00b0C for 1 h, 140 \u00b0C for 1 h, and 140 \u00b0C for 3 h, respectively. After the reaction was complete, the resultant pink precipitates were centrifuged, washed with distilled water and then ethanol to minimize the extra ions in the final products, and dried at 80 \u00b0C in air. Finally, the synthesized compounds were calcined at 350 \u00b0C in air for 2 h. The corresponding calcined products are designated as C1, C2, and C3, respectively. 2.2 Materials characterization Crystallographic information on the as-prepared samples was obtained by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, GBC MMA, Cu K\u03b1 radiation, 40 kV, 25 mA) at a scanning rate of 2\u00b0 min \u22121 . Chemical bonding in the precursor compounds was studied with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Nicolet 380, USA) using the potassium bromide (KBr) pellet technique. The thermal behavior of the precursors was examined using simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (METTLER TOLEDO, Australia). The measurements were performed at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 from room temperature to 500 \u00b0C in air. The morphologies and structures of the precursors, as well as the calcined samples, were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL JSM7500FA, 15 kV), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (JEOL 2011F, 200 kV). Specific surface areas and pore size distributions of the calcined samples were determined from the results of N 2 physisorption at 77 K (Micromeritics ASAP 2020) using the Brunauer\u2013Emmet\u2013Teller (BET) and Barrett\u2013Joyner\u2013Halenda (BJH) methods, respectively. 2.3 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical measurements were carried out via CR2032 coin-type cell with lithium metal as the counter and reference electrode at room temperature. The working electrode consisted of 70 wt% active material (the as-prepared Co 3 O 4 ), 15 wt% carbon black, and 15 wt% polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF). The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF 6 in a 1:2 (v/v) mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC). Cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box (Mbraun, Germany). Charge\u2013discharge cycles were measured between 0.01 V and 3.0 V at various current rates up to 800 mA g \u22121 on a Land CT2001A Cycler. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the cells was conducted at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s \u22121 using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660C). 3 Results and discussion The XRD patterns in Fig. 1 show that the precursors generated by microwave irradiation using urea hydrolysis are cobalt-basic-carbonate compounds. Previously, several reports have focused on the synthesis of cobalt basic carbonate compounds by homogeneous or heterogeneous co-precipitation and on their thermal decomposition behavior [24] . The XRD patterns show characteristic peaks of the cobalt-basic-carbonate phase, which are in good agreement with the reported compound, Co(OH) 1.0 (CO 3 ) 0.5 \u00b70.11H 2 O, with lattice constants a = 8.79 \u00c5, b = 10.15 \u00c5, and c = 4.43 \u00c5 (space group P 22 1 2) [25] . The hkl reflections shown in Fig. 1 (a) can be indexed perfectly to this orthorhombic solid compound. Apart from the cobalt-basic-carbonates, other possible precipitates, such as Co(OH) 2 , CoCO 3 , and Co(OH) x (NO) 2\u2212 x \u00b7 n H 2 O, were not detected. From the XRD results, the precursor crystallinity is obviously improved by increasing the temperature and prolonging the time from 110 \u00b0C for 1 h ( Fig. 1 (a)), to 140 \u00b0C for 1 h ( Fig. 1 (b)), to 140 \u00b0C for 3 h ( Fig. 1 (c)). Furthermore, the tendency towards oriented growth of the compounds under different microwave irradiation conditions is indicated by their XRD patterns. Fig. 2 shows the FTIR spectra of the precursors generated under different microwave irradiation conditions. Our FTIR results are in very close agreement with Xu and Zeng's [24a] results obtained using the traditional homogeneous precipitation method by urea hydrolysis. This further affirms the formation of cobalt-basic-carbonate compounds, however, in contrast to traditional heating, microwave irradiation has the obvious advantage of accelerating urea hydrolysis. In the closed system irradiated by microwaves, the urea hydrolysis provides both carbonate and hydroxyl anions to react with cobalt cations, so that the resultant precursor is a cobalt-basic-carbonate compound, the formula of which is usually written as Co(OH) x (CO 3 ) 1\u22120.5 x \u00b7 y H 2 O. The formation process of the cobalt-basic-carbonate compounds is shown below: CO(NH 2 ) 2 + 4H 2 O \u2192 CO 3 2\u2212 +2OH \u2212 +2NH 4 + + 2H + Co 2+ + x OH \u2212 + (1 \u2212 0.5 x )CO 3 2\u2212 + y H 2 O \u2192 Co(OH) x (CO 3 ) 1\u22120.5 x \u00b7 y H 2 O However, the reaction temperature and time under microwave irradiation have large effects on the evolution of the composition, structure, and morphology of the cobalt-basic-carbonate compound. Changes in the carbonate and hydroxyl groups in compounds synthesized under different microwave irradiation conditions are confirmed by their infrared spectra (in Fig. 2 ). The shoulder vibration appearing at around 3369\u20133382 cm \u22121 is attributed to the O\u2013H groups interacting with carbonate anions. The bands at 965\u2013975 cm \u22121 are ascribed to \u03b4 (Co\u2013OH) bending modes. The two stronger absorption peaks (in the dotted-line ellipses in Fig. 2 (b)) of the compound generated from microwave irradiation at 140 \u00b0C for 3 h compared to the compound obtained from 110 \u00b0C for 1 h indicate that the incorporated carbonate anions are partially replaced by O\u2013H groups for the 140 \u00b0C, 3 h sample. The obvious splitting of bands observed at 1570\u20131370 cm \u22121 for this sample indicates a decrease in the symmetry of the carbonate groups. The effects of the synthesis temperature and time under microwave irradiation on the crystallite morphology are further demonstrated by their FESEM images ( Fig. 3 ). A wire-like precursor is obtained at 110 \u00b0C for 1 h ( Fig. 3 (a)), a mixture of nanowires and nanoplatelets is obtained at 140 \u00b0C for 1 h ( Fig. 3 (b)), and a large quadrate platelet precursor is obtained at 140 \u00b0C for 3 h ( Fig. 3 (c)). Fig. S1 in the Electronic supplementary information (ESI) presents the TGA and DSC curves for the wire-like precursor and the platelet-like precursor. The difference between the TGA/DSC results for C1 and C3 also confirms discrepancies in the composition of precursors generated under different microwave irradiation conditions. For the wire-like precursor with low crystallinity, the weak exothermic peak at 225\u2013235 \u00b0C is mainly owing to the oxidation of Co 2+ , and an endothermic peak caused by the decomposition of carbonate anions and dehydroxylation is not observed. For the platelet-like precursor with high crystallinity, corresponding to the decomposition of carbonate anions and subsequent dehydroxylation, a well-defined endothermic peak at the higher temperature of 260\u2013330 \u00b0C is observed. This is understandable because the latter was better crystallized. Fig. S2 in the ESI shows the XRD patterns of samples C1, C2 and C3 obtained by calcining the corresponding precursors at 350 \u00b0C for 2 h in air. The peaks in the three XRD patterns are identical and can be perfectly indexed as cubic spinel Co 3 O 4 phase (JCPDS card No. 43-1003, cubic crystal, space group: Fd-3 m, a = 8.084 \u00c5. This indicates that all the cobalt-basic-carbonate compounds are transformed completely to Co 3 O 4 after calcining at 350 \u00b0C for 2 h. The morphologies of all the Co 3 O 4 samples are displayed in Fig. 4 . The FESEM image of C1 ( Fig. 4 (a)) indicates that after the calcination, the original wire-like precursors are converted into porous strings (wires) of Co 3 O 4 nanocrystals interconnected along the original longitudinal direction. Interestingly, the porous Co 3 O 4 nanowires with a diameter of 40 nm are self-assembled into many arrays. Fig. 4 (c) indicates that the platelet-like precursor is converted into porous platelets of Co 3 O 4 nanocrystals interconnected along the 2D direction of the platelets. The porous platelets have a thickness of 40 nm. Fig. 4 (b) shows that the calcined product C2 is a mixture of porous nanowires and nanoplatelets. The morphology and structure of the Co 3 O 4 nanowires (sample C1) were further characterized by TEM and HRTEM, as shown in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5 (a) demonstrates that each Co 3 O 4 array is composed of many aligned nanowires. The inset in Fig. 5 (a) is the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern corresponding to site A in the array. The SAED pattern indicates that the Co 3 O 4 nanowires have an obvious degree of orientation which has a predominant assembly direction of [1 1 1], which is perpendicular to the Co 3 O 4 wires, because the intensities of the hkl diffractions are much stronger compared with the rest. Fig. 5 (b) shows the morphology of a typical individual Co 3 O 4 nanowire with a diameter of 40 nm and a length of 0.36 \u03bcm. The nanowire is porous and constructed from numerous interconnected Co 3 O 4 nanocrystals with the size of several nanometers. The HRTEM images from the end and the middle of the nanowire are exhibited in Fig. 5 (c) and (d), respectively. The well-defined lattice fringes of d 1 1 1 (0.47 nm) in Co 3 O 4 crystals on the end and the middle parts of the wire are both parallel to the wire. This further indicates that the crystalline direction of the Co 3 O 4 wire during calcination is mainly along the [1 1 0] direction. Fig. 5 (d) also shows an inter-crystalline pore is with a size of about 12 nm. The porous structure of the calcined Co 3 O 4 samples can be further quantified with nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements. Fig. 6 shows the N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms and corresponding Barrett\u2013Joyner\u2013Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution curves (insets) of C1 and C2. The characteristic type IV isotherms with type H3 hysteresis loops of both C1 and C2 confirm the highly porous structure of the Co 3 O 4 samples prepared by calcining the cobalt-basic-carbonate compounds. This result is consistent with the above FESEM observations. More quantitative measures come from the corresponding pore size distributions calculated from the desorption branches. As can be seen from the inset of Fig. 6 (a), the pore size distribution is very narrow, in the range of 9\u201316 nm, for sample C1. This indicates the inter-crystalline pores in the Co 3 O 4 nanowires are well-proportioned. The Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) specific surface area of C1 is 41 m 2 g \u22121 . Compared to C1, the pore size distribution of sample C2 ( Fig. 6 (b), inset) is broader, in the range of 9\u201324 nm, and its BET specific surface area is 34 m 2 g \u22121 . This indicates that, although both samples were subjected to a constant annealing for 2 h at 350 \u00b0C, the inter-crystalline pores generated in the Co 3 O 4 nanoplatelets are not even during the thermal decomposition and transformation of the platelet-like compound. Based on the observations above, Fig. 7 schematically illustrates the stepwise growth process of the cobalt-basic-carbonate precursors in microwave homogeneous synthesis and their self-supported transformation by calcination. It is well-known that the precipitation of cobalt cations and a base usually generates cobalt hydroxides, which are usually formed into hexagonal \u03b2-Co(OH) 2 crystal platelets with high crystallinity [26] . However, the cobalt-basic-carbonate compounds are generated by homogeneous precipitation using urea in a closed system. The incorporated carbonate anions change the crystal structure and morphology of the generated basic compounds. During the growth of the compound, the carbonate anions may also act as an inhibitor that selectively decreases the rates of crystal growth along both the [0 0 1] and the [1 0 0] directions, resulting in the [0 1 0]-elongated nanowires. However, with increasing reaction temperature and time, the pH value of the solution is increased [27] , and the carbonate anions in the compound are partially replaced by hydroxyl groups. The tendency towards oriented growth of the compound dominated by carbonate anions is weakened after microwave irradiation at 140 \u00b0C for 3 h, so the initial nanowires aggregate side-by-side and finally form a large platelet with improved crystallinity. All the calcined samples keep the morphology of the corresponding precursors, it is different that they are porous nanowires or nanoplatelets interconnected by many Co 3 O 4 nanocrystals. As revealed in our TGA/DSC results ( Fig. S1 ), during thermal decomposition, the elimination of hydroxyl and carbonate groups, and the formation of a new crystalline phase cause the disruption of the original morphology and induce Co 3 O 4 nanocrystals to self-assemble into the porous 1D strings or 2D platelets. The electrochemical performances of the as-prepared Co 3 O 4 products were evaluated by a standard method based on Co 3 O 4 /Li half cells, where the Co 3 O 4 and lithium foil serve as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. Fig. 8 compares the cyclability of samples C1 and C2 at a current density of 50 mA g \u22121 , which is commonly used in the energy materials community for testing Co 3 O 4 /Li. The Co 3 O 4 arrays self-assembled from porous Co 3 O 4 nanowires (C1) exhibit ultra-high capacity and excellent cyclability. Interestingly, the capacity of C1 gradually increases to 1520 mAh g \u22121 over the first 30 cycles, which is far beyond the theoretical value of 890 mAh g \u22121 . After 40 cycles, the capacity decreases, and a reversible capacity of 820 mAh g \u22121 can be maintained after 80 cycles. Compared to sample C1, sample C2, which is composed of Co 3 O 4 nanowires and nanoplatelets, exhibits inferior cyclability. After increasing slightly, its capacity rapidly fades to only 300 mAh g \u22121 over 40 cycles. The difference in electrochemical behavior between the porous Co 3 O 4 arrays self-assembled from porous nanowires (C1) and the mixture of Co 3 O 4 nanowires and nanoplatelets (C2) is further explained by the discharge/charge profiles in Fig. 9 (a) and (b) . From the discharge profiles, it is clear that capacities are mainly from two sections, the long plateau region (corresponding to the redox conversion reaction between Li and Co 3 O 4 ) and the subsequent sloping region (corresponding to the surface layer formation). Due to undergoing a similar initial conversion reaction, the early discharge/charge curves for C1 and C2 are similar, with their first discharge capacities both about 1200 mAh g \u22121 and their initial coulombic efficiencies both close to 80%. However, the subsequent cycles for C1 and C2 are significantly different. For C1, the 40th and 60th discharge/charge curves indicate that the redox conversion reaction and the surface layer formation/decomposition with cycling are reversible, so the porous Co 3 O 4 nanowires exhibit an ultra-high reversible capacity. In the early cycles, more and more polymer layer formation makes the capacity gradually increase, and for the 40th cycle, the capacity is up to the maximum. Thereafter, the capacity gradually decreases because there is little irreversible conversion, and after the 60th cycle, the capacity tends to be stable, so that the capacity retention appears as a semicircle-type feature. We propose that the higher surface area of the porous nanowires permits, on cycling, an increase in the extent of polymer layer formation on the surface of the active materials. For C2, the 15th and 30th discharge/charge curves show that the electrochemical reactions appear to be poorly reversible. For the 30th cycle, the plateau reaction is obviously shortened, so that the discharge capacity is not more than 400 mAh g \u22121 . To further elucidate the electrochemical process, cyclic voltammograms (CV) of sample C1 for the first, second, and 5th cycles are presented in Fig. S3 in the ESI . In the first cycle, there are two reduction peaks, including one weak shoulder peak at 1.2 V and another strong peak at 0.9 V, and one oxidation peak at 2.1 V. The two reduction peaks are generally attributed to the reduction of the Co 3 O 4 to CoO (or Li x Co 3 O 4 ) and metallic Co, respectively, accompanying the oxidation of metallic Li. The oxidation peak is mainly attributed to the oxidation of metallic Co, accompanying the decomposition of Li 2 O [5] . The whole conversion reaction of Li with Co 3 O 4 can be written as follows: C o 3 O 4 + 8 Li + 8 e \u2212 \u21c4 Recharging Discharging 4 L i 2 O + 3 Co which has a theoretical capacity of 890 mAh g \u22121 . The main reduction peak shifts to a higher potential at 1.15 V in the subsequent cycles. This might be related to the pulverization of the Co 3 O 4 [28] . A shoulder reduction peak at 0.6 V and a shoulder oxidation peak at 2.4 V appear in the subsequent cycles, indicating that another reversible redox reaction accompanies the reaction between Li and Co 3 O 4 . This is attributed to the formation and decomposition of the polymer layer on the surface of the active material. The gradually increased capacity up to 1520 mAh g \u22121 over the first 30 cycles is likely to be due to the contribution of the polymer layer. The existence of higher than theoretical specific capacity in Co 3 O 4 has also been observed and reported before [15,29] , and it is plausibly attributed to the reversible growth of a Li-bearing polymeric layer on the surface of the active material, resulting from electrolyte degradation. The polymer layers that have been intensively studied turn out to be formed by a multistep degradation mechanism including electrochemical and chemical processes [30] . Fig. 10 shows the rate capability of C1 at different current rates 50 mA g \u22121 , 200 mA g \u22121 , 400 mA g \u22121 , and 800 mA g \u22121 . At a 50 mA g \u22121 rate, the capacity gradually increases, at a 200 mA g \u22121 rate, the capacity is relatively constant. At the larger 400 mA g \u22121 and 800 mA g \u22121 rates, the capacity decreases slowly to 590 mAh g \u22121 . In addition, after 9 cycles at the 800 mA g \u22121 rate, the capacity is completely recovered at the 50 mA g \u22121 rate. Fig. 11 shows that sample C1 still exhibits good cycling performance at the large current rate of 400 mA g \u22121 , and the reversible capacity of 600 mAh g \u22121 can be maintained after 100 cycles. The above results indicate that the electrochemical properties of nanostructured Co 3 O 4 are highly dependent on not only its size and morphology, but also its textural characteristics. We believe that the high capacity and rate capability of sample C1 come from the unique hierarchical architecture. First, the porous nanowire array configuration can ensure that every nanowire participates in the electrochemical reaction, because every nanowire is in electric contact with the Cu substrate and also interfaced with the electrolyte solution. Second, the open space between neighbouring nanowires allows for easy diffusion of the electrolyte. This feature is particularly helpful for high power applications, when the battery is charged or discharged at high current. Third, the nanowires are mesoporous, with an average pore size of 12 nm and a BET surface area of 41 m 2 g \u22121 . The porosity will enhance the electrolyte/Co 3 O 4 contact area, shorten the Li + ion diffusion length in the nanowires, and accommodate the strain induced by the volume change during the electrochemical reaction. Furthermore, the one-dimensional structure of the nanowires with crystalline orientation is also helpful for both the lithium ion conduction and the electronic conduction, which play a critical role in the rate capability. As a result, the mesoporous nanowire arrays can achieve good cycling stability and high rate capability. In comparison, for sample C2, although the platelets are also porous, the interconnected feature of Co 3 O 4 crystals in two dimensions decreases the BET surface area of the sample, which is 34 m 2 g \u22121 , extends the Li + ion diffusion length in the platelets, and restricts the strain induced by the volume change during the electrochemical reaction. Therefore, an increasing polarization in the cell results in the rapid fading of capability during cycling. 4 Conclusions The microwave-assisted homogeneous precipitation approach by urea hydrolysis is very effective for the synthesis of metal-basic-carbonate compounds. Furthermore, the dimensions and morphology of the synthesized precursor compounds can be tailored through changes in the incorporated anions (CO 3 2\u2212 and OH \u2212 ) by controlling the temperature and time under microwave irradiation. The wire-like cobalt-basic-carbonate compound was synthesized due to the dominance of CO 3 2\u2212 anions at 110 \u00b0C for 1 h under microwave irradiation. The platelet-like cobalt-basic-carbonate compound was synthesized due to the dominance of OH \u2212 anions at 140 \u00b0C for 3 h under microwave irradiation. Upon thermal decomposition at 350 \u00b0C, the above precursor compounds self-supportedly transform into porous nanostructured Co 3 O 4 . The wire-like precursor compound self-assembles into one-dimensional porous arrays of Co 3 O 4 nanowires constructed of interconnected Co 3 O 4 nanocrystals along the [1 1 0] axis. The platelet-like precursor compound is transformed into large porous nanoplatelets. This study demonstrates that the electrochemical properties of the obtained Co 3 O 4 as electrode material for lithium-ion batteries are strongly dependent on the morphology and textural features. Compared with the porous Co 3 O 4 nanoplatelets, the porous nanowire Co 3 O 4 array exhibits excellent capacity retention and rate capability at higher current rates, and its reversible capacity of 600 mAh g \u22121 can be maintained after 100 cycles at the high current rate of 400 mA g \u22121 . Moreover, the approach presented here opens a potential avenue to explore the synthesis of various other metal oxides with different nanomorphologies.

The lithium intercalation/de-intercalation behavior of as-prepared MoS 2 nanoflake electrode was also investigated. It was found that the MoS 2 nanoflake electrode exhibited higher specific capacity, with very high cycling stability, compared to MoS 2 nanoparticle electrode.

        "abstract": "The influences of connectivity and disorder on the critical current density Jc are discussed to clarify the different mechanisms of Jc(H) enhancement in different magnetic field ranges. Excess Mg in MgxB2+10\u2002wt\u2009%\u2002SiC composites effectively improves the connectivity, as evidenced by both the resistivity properties and the Raman scattering. The promising Jc(H) of Mg1.15B2+10\u2002wt\u2009%\u2002SiC is attributed to both the high connectivity and the improved irreversibility field, Hirr, which is in agreement with the Raman fitting analysis. Raman scattering measurements suggest a strengthened electron-E2g coupling and weakened disorder with Mg addition.",

Lattice strain has significant effects on the superconducting properties in MgB 2 superconductor. We have systematically studied the relationship between lattice strain and superconducting properties (such as critical temperature, T c , the upper critical field, H c 2 , the irreversibility field, H irr , and hence the critical current density, J c ) in pure and different chemical doped MgB 2 samples. In contrast to the common practice of improving the J c and H c 2 of MgB 2 through chemical substitution, by taking advantage of residual thermal strains we are able to design a composite, which shows only a small drop in T c and little increase in resistivity, but a significant improvement over the J c and H c 2 of MgB 2 .",

The composite was characterized by X-ray diffraction, and the particle size and shape in the Sn-SnO2/C composite were determined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The results show that the Sn-SnO2/C composite takes on a nanofiber morphology, with the diameters of the nanofibers distributed from 50 to 200 nm. The electrochemical properties of the Sn-SnO2/C composite were also investigated. The Sn-SnO2/C composite as an electrode material has both higher reversible capacity (887 mAh x g(-1)) and good cycling performance in lithium-anode cells working at room temperature in a 3.0 V to 0.01 V potential window. The Sn-SnO2/C composite could retain a discharge capacity of 546 mAh/g after 30 cycles. The outstanding electrochemical properties of the Sn-SnO2/C composite obtained by this method make it possible for this composite to be used as a promising anode material.",

The electrical properties of 100 grain boundaries of the degraded ZnO varistor sample were directly measured and compared with those of the undegraded sample. The statistical results intuitively show that the nonlinear coefficients decrease and the leakage currents increase among most of the grain boundaries due to the pulse current. The mean breakdown voltage of a single grain boundary is around 3.2 V and does not show obvious variation between those two samples. However, several grain boundaries became conductive after being subjected to pulse current stress. \u00a9 2010 The American Ceramic Society.",

        "abstract": "Three-phase short-circuit arcs often cause the breakage of covered conductors on distribution lines, and their movement processes have become an important problem in power-distribution systems. This paper presents the studies on the movement simulation of the three-phase short-circuit arcs. Based on the latest electric arc model and the coupling of magnetic field and motion, this paper develops the procedure to simulate the movement processes of the arcs. Simulation results show that the arcs have different movement directions and behaviors, which are in agreement with the experimental phenomena. This paper is very helpful to design an effective device that prevents the arcs from causing the breakage of the conductor and the damage of the insulator.",

Fractal model of lightning is adopted by some researchers due to its similarity in appearance to natural lightning, however, as a result of the randomness of natural lightning discharge, distribution of strike points is actually a statistical result. In this paper, a numerical model for fractal simulation and corresponding computer program are established. Taking a certain transmission line as example, analysis in terms of statistics is proposed and comparisons are made with traditional electrogeometric model(EGM) and leader progression model(LPM).",

The current\u2013voltage ( I \u2013 V ) characteristics of individual grain boundaries were measured on a microprobe station after the sample was degraded under different ageing time. The results indicated that the I \u2013 V characteristics of individual grain boundaries varied non-uniformly during ageing process, which could be roughly classified into two categories as monotonic and non-monotonic. It is revealed that degradation and recovery of electrical properties coexisted in the ageing process, which could be explained with ion migration and oxygen desorption mechanisms.",

The transient characteristic of the grounding grid is very important to the safe and reliable operation of the power system. A circuit model with a lumped time-variable parameter is proposed to calculate the transient characteristics of a grounding grid under lightning current. The ionization phenomena around the ground conductors in the soil are simulated by means of time-variable parameters under appropriate conditions. The influences of different parameters on the transient characteristics of the grounding grid subjected to lightning impulse current are analyzed and the effective usage area of the grounding grid under lightning is discussed.",

        "abstract": "When HVDC system operates in monopolar mode and uses the earth as a return path, partial entering ground current may flow into the power transformers, which neutral point grounded, and this will bring a series unfavorable consequences to system operation and transformer. Using electromagnetic coupling method, this paper establishes model of the single-phase transformer with considering the variation of load, and analyzes the effects of such DC current on a single-phase core-form power transformer, such as increment of current harmonics and DC flux in the iron core. The simplified transformer model, under unloaded condition, is analyzed based on analytic method to verify its validity. Furthermore, the influence of different transformer operation status has also been discussed. The simulation results indicate that lower operation point can be more advantageous against the DC bias effects.",

The simulation models include the spatial model, the temporal model of a long ac arc, and the motion simulation models of an arc root and an arc column. The spatial model discretizes a long arc to current elements; the temporal model is proposed to consider the motion mode of a current element; and the motion simulation models of an arc root and an arc column describe the motion processes of an arc root and a column, respectively. At last, numerical simulations and corresponding experiments of long ac arcs along the surfaces of insulator strings of overhead transmission lines are compared.

Using these methods, this paper analyzed the arc-guiding performance of grading rings by simulating the motion processes of power frequency arcs under the cases of different structures of grading rings and different positions of initial arcs. The simulation analysis shows that for the closed grading rings the power frequency arc moves always around the insulator and can not be burnt stably at the load-side, which would damage insulators seriously; for the opened grading rings, however, the power frequency arc can remain to burn stably at the load-side where the gap is opened on the grading ring. The results show that the opened grading rings have the better arc-guiding performance than the closed grading ring. The results are benefit for designing and developing the grading rings with perfect arc-guiding performance for composite insulators.",

We analyzed the protection range of the lighting rod on the basis of the fractal model of the lightning channel. Due to the lower probability of lightnings with lightning current directly striking the DC yard, densely packed shielding wires were suggested to be used to protect electrical equipment in the UHV DC yard. According to the lightning withstand level of different devices in the DC yard, the polyline method, rolling-sphere method, leader progression model, and fractal model were applied to analyze the spacing distances in different regions of UHV DC yard. The results from different methods are compared, and the recommended values of shielding wire spacing distances in different regions of UHV DC yard are suggested, which have been applied in the shield wire designs of Xiangjiaba-Shanghai and Jinping-Sunan \u00b1800 kV UHVDC yards.",

        "abstract": "The stability and interaction of quantized vortices in the nonlinear wave equation (NLWE) are investigated both numerically and analytically. A review of the reduced dynamic law governing the motion of vortex centers in the NLWE is provided. The second order nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the reduced dynamic law are solved analytically for some special initial data. Using 2D polar coordinates, the transversely highly oscillating far field conditions can be efficiently resolved in the phase space, thus giving rise to an efficient and accurate numerical method for the NLWE with non-zero far field conditions. By applying this numerical method to the NLWE, we study the stability of quantized vortices and find numerically that the quantized vortices with winding number m = \u00b1 1 are dynamically stable, and resp. | m | > 1 are dynamically unstable, in the dynamics of NLWE. We then compare numerically quantized vortex interaction patterns of the NLWE with those from the reduced dynamic law qualitatively and quantitatively. Some conclusive findings are obtained, and discussions on numerical and theoretical results are made to provide further understanding of vortex stability and interactions in the NLWE. Finally, the vortex motion under an inhomogeneous potential in the NLWE is also studied.",

In conjunction with the conductive mechanism of soil, the experiment results were explained initially. A horizontal electrode was taken as an example to analyze the impact of temperature on impulse grounding resistance. The experiments show that the initial electric breakdown field intensity of the soil decreases with the increase of the temperature, moisture and salinity; the power frequency grounding resistance and impulse grounding resistance of the electrode increase with the decrease of the soil temperature, but the impulse coefficient decreases.",

This is the most important EMD source during the steady state. Characteristics of the EMD caused by transient processes of switching operations were analyzed based on tests. It is shown that damping oscillatory waves are generated in secondary cables. The major frequency is about 0.4 MHz to 2 MHz and the amplitude is about several hundred volts. Because of the high corona inception voltage of DC tube buses, the radio frequency disturbance level caused by the corona phenomenon in DC yards is relatively low.",

The deep suppression of switching overvoltage is thus a key issue of current ultra-high voltage (UHV) systems. Presently, the low residual voltage surge arresters and the arresters with controllable residual voltage are being developed. These new arresters could be an effective way to provide deep suppression of switching overvoltages in UHV systems. Simulations show that the low residual voltage arresters will dramatically reduce overvoltage levels of various types of switching overvoltages. Much lower overvoltage levels can be obtained by distributing arresters along the line. As a result of using these low residual voltage arresters, present overvoltage protection methodologies and insulation coordination rules will be changed; overvoltage withstand requirements for UHV power apparatus will be greatly reduced, and the closing resistors for breakers can be eliminated.",

Previous studies have mainly focused on reduced-scale experiments or single-phase test lines. In this context, a real-size experimental system aimed at studying upward leader characteristics on both phase conductor and ground wire is designed, where an ac voltage and an impulse voltage are respectively applied on the phase conductor and the plate-rod electrode simultaneously. Various experiments targeting 110 kV, 220 kV, 500 kV and 1000 kV ac transmission lines based on long air gap discharge between the plate-rod electrode and phase conductor or ground line, were carried out to study the influence of change of ground wire protection angle on phase conductor regarding upward leader characteristics.",

Three types of integrated electro-optic sensors, designed and fabricated for measuring intensive impulse electric field, was implemented in this paper. The theoretical concerns and specific characteristics of these integrated electro-optic sensors were illustrated in terms of their structures and key parameters. The time domain input/output characteristic and frequency response of the sensors were examined too. Comparison of the time domain characteristics of these sensors revealed that the mono-shield sensor was more efficient than those with antennas in measurable amplitudes, which is critical for high electric field measurement in gas breakdown research. In addition, the application of the sensor in the lightning impulse experiment upon air gap not only verify the existence of streamer charge but also ensured that this sensor is expected to be widely used in transient measurement investigations such as the measurement of lightning electric field, air breakdown procedure, and maybe surface discharge.",

Measuring and evaluating the corona loss of transmission line is significant for transmission line design and economic operation. So, a kind of measurement equipment for corona loss (CL) was developed. The corona loss of UHVDC transmission line with different structure size was measured in High Voltage Technology National Engineering Laboratory(Kunming). Influences of structure size, applied voltage and conductor surface field strength were analyzed. An empirical formula for UHVDC transmission line CL prediction in high altitude area was proposed. Results show that CL increases exponentially with the applied voltage. Under the same voltage lever, total CL with bipolar voltage applied is much higher than that of mono-polar voltage applied. CL of the negative pole is slightly bigger than of positive pole. CL would be decrease with increasing of pole distance and decreasing of bundle spacing. The proposed empirical formula is more proper at high altitude (about 2100 m above sea level).",

Experiment results of 50% switching impulse sparkover voltages (U50) for different live working entering routes on a real tower are presented. The potential and electric-field distribution around the 750 kV straight tower window with a line worker inside, was analyzed via an approach combing charge simulation method and indirect boundary element method. The comparison demonstrates the close relationship between electric-field distribution and U50. The sparkover voltage and the maximum electric-field strength change synchronously for a specific structure.

        "abstract": "The surface electric field (SEF) for the quasi-static negative corona discharge in atmospheric pressure air is investigated by the general fluid model which contains the continuity equations of electrons, positive ions, and negative ions coupled with Gauss' equation, considering the secondary electron emission. The SEF for the monopolar ion flow, which assumes that the whole interelectrode gap is filled with monopolar ions, is also investigated by the simplified model under the same boundary conditions at the anode. The results predict that the SEF remains constant at the onset value for both the negative corona plasma and the monopolar ion flow under a low corona current. With the increase of the corona current, the SEF is slightly strengthened for the negative corona plasma and significantly weakened for the monopolar ion flow in a wide range of conductor radii. The results for the monopolar ion flow are consistent with those deduced from the experimental data in the literature.",

The effective protection distance should be taken into account for the installation to avoid the influence of oscillation phenomenon. For household appliances, their port impedance characteristics are more complex and frequency dependent, and for some appliances, the impedance characteristics are different in operating state and nonoperating state. With the method proposed in this paper, operating state impedance characteristics of 16 different kinds of appliances are measured and the equivalent circuits are obtained by vector fitting and circuit synthesis. The protection effect of SPDs is simulated by electromagnetic transient analysis software using a practical distribution system model, and the effective protection distances of SPDs with different protection level for these appliances are obtained. Several analyses are made about relationships between the protection distance and factors such as the type of appliance, operating condition, and protection level. A case of protection for multiappliance is also analyzed. \u00a9 2011 IEEE.",

The substation is handled as a lumped equivalent model, and the detailed substation structure is not taken into account in present switching transient calculations. In this study, the influence of considering a substation structure on the switching transient calculation of a 1000-kV ultra-high-voltage system is analyzed, and the factors affecting this calculation are obtained. Generally, considering the substation structure will not affect the calculation of switching overvoltage amplitudes, but it will generate a damped oscillation with a very sharp wavefront and very high frequencies upon the familiar switching transient waveform. Attention should be paid to the insulation withstand level of air gaps and power apparatus to this kind of complex wave of a short-front rapid impulse superimposed on a long-front slow impulse. \u00a9 2006 IEEE.",

The method to generate interference on an optical fiber cable by lightning stroke was analyzed. Different grounding methods were comprehensively discussed by a numerical calculation method. The ideal grounding method for optical fiber cable is to ground the internal strengthening core and the outer metal sheath in the meantime. The electrical field intensity applied inside the optical fiber cable increases with the soil resistivity. The frequency of the interference source is an important factor to affect the interference electrical field generated inside the optical fiber cable.

The streamer inception characteristic under DC voltage has been researched by many researchers, but the characteristic under impulse voltage especially under lightning impulse voltage with large voltage rise rate has been rarely studied. The current and electric field measurement system based on optic-electric integrated technology was proposed in this paper, focusing on the inception characteristics of streamers in 1 m rod-plane air gap energized by positive lightning impulse voltage. The new diagnosis of streamer inception was given, and the streamer inception voltages and electric fields under different electrode and voltage rise rate were recorded. According to experiment results, the streamer inception electric field criterion considering voltage rise rate was proposed. The criterion in this paper was verified for wide parameter ranges. The measurement results of streamer inception time delay were reported, which provides the basis for researching distribution and physical mechanism of streamer inception time delay. \u00a92012 Chin.

The effect of the mutual inductances among grounding system conductors on the performance of the grounding grid is investigated. It can be seen that although the effect of the mutual inductances is very small at power frequency, when a large grounding grid buried in soil with low resistivity is analyzed, the effect of the mutual inductances should be taken care of even the frequency is not very high. What's more, when this kind of grounding grid is stricken by a 30 kA 2.6/40 mus lightning current, if the mutual inductances are neglected, although the waveform of the transient potential at the current injected point is almost the same with that considering the mutual inductances at the rise time, it falls more slowly than that considering the mutual inductances.",

Seasonal frozen soil changes the grounding resistances of the substation grounding grids and the tower footing devices, which seasonally influences the maximum grid current. This paper first introduces the method to calculate the fault current-division factor, and then discusses the influence of the seasonal frozen soil layer on it by using the proposed method. Based on the cases of two substations connected by the transmission lines and without neutrals or other connection paths, the influence of several factors on the fault current-division factor, including the thickness of seasonal frozen soil, and the number of transmission lines with overhead ground wire connected to the substation grounding grid, is analyzed. It is reasonable to consider the influence of the seasonal frozen soil on the fault current-division factor in grounding grid design. According to the analysis, adding vertical grounding rods to the grounding grid and the tower footing grounding device can almost eliminate this seasonal influence. \u00a9 1986-2012 IEEE.",

How to obtain the status of the corrosion easily is very important for the safety of the operation. A novel method is proposed, by which corrosion status of grounding system can be diagnosed from measured port resistances among the touchable down-lead conductors connected to the grounding grid. First, the mathematical relationship between the corrosion status of the grounding grid's all grounding conductors and the measured port resistances is deduced in detail based on circuit model and theory. Then, an appropriate mathematical model is discussed for practicable computation. The completed corrosion diagnosis system, including hardware device of data measurement, diagnosis and analysis software, is also introduced concisely.

Perhaps, This parameter is mainly determined by the electrical characteristic uniformity of microstructures, e.g. electronic states, and there are not direct relation to the uniformity of microstructure. The obvious effect by improving the geometrical uniformity of ZnO varistor is to increase the global breakdown voltage and nonlinearity coefficient of ZnO varistor. Although the global breakdown voltage is directly related to the electrical characteristic uniformity of microstructure, it is affected more easily by the breakdown path which is determined by the geometrical uniformity of microstructure.

The influences of vertical grounding electrodes on grounding resistance, step and touch voltages were analyzed numerically. The results show that the vertical grounding electrodes can effectively decrease grounding resistance, step and touch voltages of the grounding system and reduce the influence of seasonal factors on the grounding system. However, the grounding system becomes saturated as more vertical grounding electrodes are arranged in a substation with a fixed size.

An accurate and efficient numerical analysis method for analyzing the ion-flow field of the ac-dc hybrid lines is helpful for engineering design. In this paper, an upwind finite volume-based algorithm for the solution of the ac-dc hybrid ion-flow field is proposed, which can take the influence of the space charges generated by corona into account. The electric field is solved by the charge simulation method and the finite-element method, while the advection and recombination effects of the space charges are solved by a time-dependent finite volume method. The reduced-scale ac-dc hybrid models are analyzed and the calculating results by the proposed approach in this paper have good agreements with the experimental ones in the literature and in this paper. Finally, the ground-level electric field and ion current density of the hybrid UHVAC and UHVDC transmission lines in parallel are analyzed, providing a reference for the engineering design. \u00a9 2011 IEEE.",

It will be conducted along the primary circuit, and may interfere with secondary systems such as power line carrier (PLC) systems, measuring systems and so on. A simulation method to analyze the conducted electromagnetic disturbance (EMD) based on time-domain wide-band equivalent circuits was proposed in the paper. The steady-state electromagnetic process and EMD were calculated together. Influences of operating states and device characteristics on EMD generation and propagation, can be easily considered. Models of mayor equipments such as converters, converter transformers, smoothing reactors, were described. The EMD source from valves was simulated by a macro-model, and other devices were represented by wide-band equivalent models considering working frequency and high frequency characteristics. Parameters of these models can be derived from significations and test results provided by manufacturers. The method was verified by field test results in a \u00b1500 kV converter station, and the EMD levels of a \u00b1500 kV transmission project called Guizhou-Guangzhou II were calculated by the method. \u00a9 Chin.

        "abstract": "In order to obtain characteristics of electromagnetic environment (EME) around UHVDC transmission lines and to provide reliable intelligent support for power line designing, we performed long-term statistical measurements of resultant electric field (ES) on the UHVDC test lines located in National Laboratory for UHV Technology in Kunming, China. The lateral distribution of ES was obtained through synchronous measurements at multiple points under the test lines, and the cumulative probability distribution of ES was acquired based on the results of long-term statistical tests under standard condition. By changing minimum conductor height, pole spacing, and bundle radius, the influences of the line parameters on ES were obtained. Furthermore, the effects of line voltage and polarity on the magnitude and distribution of ES were studied. Conclusions can be drawn that, 1) under the regular operating condition, peak values of ES appear at the projection of energized poles, while the negative extremum is larger than the positive one. Compared with bipolar situation, the position where extremum shows is closer to the voltage injecting pole in mono-polar situation; 2) in spring, the statistical 50% value of the positive extremum of ES is 19.10 kV/m, while for the negative extremum, it is -25.00 kV/m, however, in fall, these two values are 23.10 kV/m and -21.50 kV/m, respectively, both larger than those in spring; 3) as the minimum conductor height, pole spacing, and bundle radius increase, the magnitude of ES decreases; 4) the magnitude of ES increases monotonously with the voltage applied on the conductors, and the increasing speeds of bipolar and mono-polar conditions are quite close to each other.",

This paper systematically discusses the seasonal influence on the safety of grounding system by numerical analysis method. If the thickness of the low-resistivity soil layer formed in raining season is smaller than the burial depth of the grounding system, the touch voltage would increase. On the other hand, the raining season leads the limit of touch voltage is smaller than the actual touch voltage, even if a surface granite layer is used. The influences of raining on the safety of grounding system must be comprehensively considered. When the high resistivity soil layer is formed in freezing season, the grounding resistance, step and touch voltages would increase with the thickness or resistivity of the freezing soil layer. When the thickness of high resistivity soil layer exceeds the burial depth of the grounding system, the grounding resistance, step and touch voltages would increase sharply, and the touch voltage would exceed the limit of touch voltage decided by a surface granite layer. In order to ensure the safety of the grounding system in freezing season, the grounding system must be designed carefully, and special measures should be used, long vertical grounding electrodes added to the grounding system can effectively attenuate the seasonal influence, and improve the safety of the grounding system.",

        "abstract": "In order to analyze the lightning transient of a thin-wire system, a time-domain method of reducing the thin-wire conductor system into an equivalent active multiport network based on the partial-element electric-circuit model is presented in this paper. A modified-mesh-current (MMC) approach is developed, uses node charge and mesh current as its variables, and takes into account both capacitive coupling and inductive coupling among conductors. Equations given by MMC are expressed in a state-space form. These equations are reduced to an active multiport network model using the trapezoidal scheme. The active multiport network is described by a constant-input-conductance matrix and a vector of currents that are updated using passed values. The multiport network can easily interface with linear and nonlinear components in an electromagnetic transient program. Since the proposed method requires only one-time calculation of the inverse of the system matrix, it is more efficient in comparison to the conventional full-wave method in the frequency domain. For a large system, well-established model-order-reduction techniques can be applied to the MMC formulation to reduce it to a small scale one. The proposed method is validated by comparing its results with NEC-calculated ones and published field measurements. Finally, the method is used to simulate two lightning-strike scenarios.",

First, this paper compared the general characteristics of press pack insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), injection-enhanced gate transistor (IEGT), and integrated gate commutated thyristor (IGCT). Then working conditions of devices were analyzed from the perspective of HCBs. According to these, vital features of devices including maximum turn-off current, on-state voltage, conduction ability, and robustness of power semiconductor devices were carefully analyzed and compared. Related experiments were implemented to compare maximum turn-off capability, and the 4.5 kV/3 kA IGBT/IEGT was able to turn off 19 and 22 kA respectively after 5-ms current conduction. Analysis and experiments indicated that IGCT was suitable for natural commutation low-voltage and low-current hybrid circuit breakers, due to its low on-state voltage and huge surge current conduction ability. Comparatively, IGBT and IEGT were more suitable for very high current interruption, and IEGT was the superior selection among available commercial devices. However, the interference should be considered in applications.",

Thereafter, a design method that is not restricted by the grounding resistance limit of the existing regulation is proposed. The main principle of this method is to increase the allowed value of grounding resistance and strengthen the equipment protection. The maximal allowed value of substation grounding resistance is calculated according to the working parameters and equipment parameters, and the initial design scheme is verified and modified according to the requirements of step voltage and touch voltage to ensure personal safety.- The grounding system structure is optimized on the principle of balancing-voltage, and the unequal spacing grounding grid technology and the explosion grounding technology are very effective. Meanwhile, the expenses on equipment protection should be increased to guarantee safe running. If the increased expenses on equipment protection are lower than the cost of decreasing grounding resistance, the whole project cost would be reduced and the grounding system can be designed both safely and economically. This method has been proved to be effective in engineering practice.",

We comprehensively analyzed the developing states, the existed problems in analysis methods and measures of transmission line lightning protection, and discussed the key issues of transmission line lightning protection in China that should be studied. The lightning protection measures are divided into back-up type and leading-type methods, so-called back-up type method is used in lightning protection of transmission line in China, which complicates lightning protection; but the so-called leading-type method is used in other countries, which simplifies lightning protection. The lightning protection measures for different sections of transmission lines should be comprehensively estimated and proposed by considering the micro-topographical feature and the regional performances of lightning parameters along transmission line. The lightning protection should be fully considered in transmission line design, reducing shielding angle of overhead wire, decreasing grounding resistances of tower footings, and suitably installing line surge arresters are fundamental methods of lightning protection of new transmission line.",

To enhance it, stray impedance is the crucial limitation, which has not been obtained accurately before. Thus, in this paper, acquisition method of impedance based on experimental measurements was carefully analyzed, including electrolytic and ceramic capacitors, \n<sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">mosfets</sc>\n, printed circuit board, and GCT housing. And each part of stray impedance was obtained based on a series of experiments with 6-inch GCTs and two types of conventional GDUs. To further enhance commutation speed, an improved GDU was developed, reducing the total stray inductance from 0.395 to 0.037 nH, stray resistance from 0.444 to 0.227\u00a0m\u03a9. An extremely high current of 12.5\u00a0kA was successfully turned off, which is the maximum turn-off current level so far. Besides, the maximum commutation capability was tested as over 17\u00a0kA. Consequently, no further optimization of GDU is necessary. However, there was still about 1.0 nH existing inside the GCT housing we used. A novel housing with lower stray inductance is expected for higher commutation speed in the future.",

        "abstract": "As a new torsional vibration absorber, the dual mass flywheel (DMF) contains a symmetric structure in which the damping element is a pair of springs symmetrically distributed along the circumference direction. Through reasonable matching parameters, the DMF functions in isolating torsional vibrations caused by the engine from the transmission system. Our work aims to solve the accuracy of matching models between the DMF and power transmission system. The critical structural parameters of each order modal are treated consecutively by two methods: Absolute sensitivity (e.g., under the idle condition and driving condition), and relative sensitivity. The operation achieves a separation of the parameters and diagnosis of the relationship between these parameters and the natural frequency in the system. In addition, the natural frequency range is determined based upon the area of the resonance speed. As a result, the matching model is established based on the sensitivity analysis method and the natural frequency range, which means the moment of inertia distribution (its coefficient should be used as one structural parameter in relative sensitivity analysis) and the torsional stiffness in multiple stages can be observed under the combined values. The effectiveness of the matching model is verified by experiments of a real vehicle test under the idling condition and driving condition. It is concluded that the analysis study can be applied to solve the parameters matching accuracy among certain multi-degree-of-freedom dynamic models.",

The equivalent soil resistivity of a multilayer soil structure depends on the soil parameters, the structure and the size of the grounding systems.

Experiments on the lightning impulse corona characteristic of bundle conductors for 1000 kV transmission lines are carried out in China UHV AC Test Base and the impulse corona Q-V curves of different bundle conductors are obtained.

        "abstract": "In this paper, based on the moment method and the circuit theory, an approach is proposed to analyze the current distribution and the electromagnetic field of a building struck by lightning. By introducing the concept of complex resistivity in the air and the soil, the approach can consider the metallic grids under the ground and above the ground altogether. Both the potential differences among the grounding parts and the electromagnetic interactions among the grids are taken into account. It shows that the resistivity of soil will affect the electromagnetic field greatly. When the electromagnetic fields around buildings near the lightning struck point are investigated, or when a building has a separated grounding system, the effect of the grounding systems must be considered.",

We researched and analyzed that the neutral line in common-tower caused the induced over-voltage and insulation flashover, leading to DC system bipolar block, when HVDC pole line was hit by lightning in the DC system. The results show that, in the common-tower with the pole line and neutral line, due to the big insulation difference, when HVDC pole line is hit by lightning, the neutral line on the common-tower will produce very high induced over-voltage and lightning wave propagation process, and the induced voltage of the neutral line has a cumulative effect to reach its insulation levels many times, thus, multi point flashover occurred in the insulation of neutral line. The results of this study on the common-tower with different voltage grade line are of significance to the design.",

        "abstract": "The reverberation chamber (RC) testing exhibits several competitive advantages over existing methods, such as the fascinating low cost of construction and the enhanced test repeatability. The application of the reverberation chamber requires a calibration before the EMI/EMS tests. A statistical analysis of the calibration data proves the field homogeneity in the working volume and provides the necessary parameters for EMI/EMS tests. The calibration consists of two parts, field strength and power measurements of the empty chamber and the same measurements of the chamber with the maximum loading. Prior to each test, the chamber has to be calibrated in order to prove that it is not adversely loaded by EUT. A prototype RC with a measurement system is built according to the simulation analysis and calibrated in terms of IEC standard. The key parameters such as field uniformity, quality factor, the average normalized electric field and the receive antenna calibration factor are analyzed in detail. Four different work volumes and methods of sweeping frequency are applied. It is indicated that the key parameters of the reverberation chamber have good testing repeatability and this will ensure good test repeatability for electromagnetic susceptibility test and electromagnetic emission test. The test results also show that the quality factor of the reverberation chamber is up to several thousands above the lowest useful frequency. All test results reveal that this reverberation chamber conforms to the specification of the IEC standard and can be used in the common EMC test.",

To simulate the rapid transient streamer discharge process, a method with high resolution and high order accuracy is highly desired. Combining the advantages of finite volume and finite element method, DG is such a choice. A simulation of a double-headed streamer discharge in Nitrogen was performed using 2-dimensional fluid model. The preliminary results are quantitatively agreed with those obtained by finite volume method combined with moving mesh, indicating the potential of extending the method to general streamer simulations in complex geometries.",

        "abstract": "Corona decides the electromagnetic environment characteristics of transmission line. It is generally considered that the space charges produced by corona discharge are restricted in the vicinity of AC transmission lines and rarely affect the ground level electrical field. So, the corona effect is usually neglected in the calculation of ground level electrical field under AC transmission lines. However, this theory needs to be proved. In this paper, the charge simulation method (CSM) based ion flow field calculation method is improved and applied into the calculation of ground level electrical field under AC transmission lines. The influence of the conductor surface field uniformity on corona discharge is counted in, so that the ion flow field of multi-phase or bundle conductors can be simulated. The ground level electrical field considering corona effect under a 3-phase 8-bundle conductor 1000 kV AC transmission line is calculated. The calculation results indicated that the corona discharge enhances the ground level electrical field, and the enhancement ratio is about 5% for typical 3-phase 1000 kV AC transmission lines. The influence of line parameters such as bundled conductor radius, split conductor spacing, split conductor number, wire spacing and phase height on ground level electrical field are discussed.",

The influences of the reflective coefficient of the double-layer soil, the top-layer soil thickness and the grounding grid area on the optimum arrangement are analyzed numerically. The results show that the optimum compression ratio (OCR) occurs when the target function of the touch voltage reaches a minimum. The OCR decreases with increasing reflective coefficient. When the bottom-layer soil resistivity is smaller than that of the top-layer soil, the horizontal conductors are more uniform than when the soil resistivity of the bottom-layer soil is higher than that of the top-layer soil. The formulas to calculate the OCR of the double-layer soil structure that were obtained analytically provide a reference for engineers to design grounding systems of substations with high safety.",

First, the grounding system was divided into fictitious segments with ohmic resistances and self and mutual inductances. Secondly, the coupled networks were connected to simulate the conductive and capacitive effects of the grounding systems. Then, the transient response to an arbitrary current waveform was obtained using EMTP. The computation was accelerated using the matrix pencil approach to extrapolate the time-domain responses. Modeling the transient time functions as the sum of complex exponentials greatly reduces the computational time and effectively suppresses instabilities that may arise at later times. The proposed method was validated by comparison with results calculated by CDEGS. The model provides a very simple interface to EMTP and can rapidly calculate transients for large scale grounding systems for EMC and lighting protection studies that involve electronic systems connected to grounding systems.",

But with the increase of operation voltage to 1000 kV and tower height to more than 100 meters, some shortcomings of the traditional EGM model were found by many researchers. Leader Progression Model (LPM) was proposed to solve these problems. But some fundamental works, such as when the upward leader initiates and how it propagates, is still indistinct. An experiment was designed and implemented in this paper to simulate the electric field circumstance near the test transmission line while the lightning downward leader approached. The upward leader from the test transmission line was clearly observed. The inception voltage and characteristics was analyzed. The streamer and leader initiated from the ground wire and conductor bundle were compared. The experiment results show that the leader initiating from the ground wire is more active in the inception stage. The velocity of the upward leader acquired is about 1.2-3.0 cm/\u03bcs.",

        "abstract": "Many EMC problems require evaluation of the transient shielding effectiveness of the thin metallic shells. A fast time domain approach was developed to calculate the transient shielding effectiveness of thin metallic shells excited by an arbitrary waveform electromagnetic pulse. The frequency domain transfer function of the thin metallic shell is fit into a rational function using the vector fitting method, with the pulse response expressed as a sum of decay exponentials in the time domain from the inverse Laplace transformation. The transient shielding effectiveness excited by an arbitrary waveform can be easily obtained based on the recursive convolution formulation. The method is a time domain algorithm that does not require the time-consuming FFT analysis, and the recursive convolution can dramatically improve the calculational efficiency. The proposed approach is validated by numerical examples.",

        "abstract": "Measuring the transient voltages, including lightning or switching impulse overvoltage, is helpful for accident analysis of power system and insulation design. In this paper, a contactless transient voltage measuring system based on a metal-free integrated electro-optic electric field sensor was proposed, implemented, and tested. The lightning and switching impulse transients are proportional to the electric field they generate, and vice versa, enabling measurement of the transient voltage by measuring the associated electric field. The proposed method uses an electric field sensor to directly measure the field generated by the voltage without any capacitive coupling. In addition, a method to decouple the multiphase coupling was proposed. The performances of the measuring system were tested by simulation experiments and compared with that of a standard divider. The field data of the transient overvoltage on a 220 kV bus during the process of putting a capacitor voltage transformer into operation were given. The measurement results were found to coincide with the related physical process.",

The conducted disturbance sources of truck crane was measured under stable conditions, the time domain characteristics of possible conducted disturbance sources was analyzed, and typical waveforms were concluded to solve the EMC (Electromagnetic Compatibility) issue. The electromagnetic disturbance characteristics at different test points under different operation conditions were compared, and the influence of different factors was studied. The amplitude and frequency parameters of the major disturbance sources were compared with the standard immunity test pulses suggested by ISO7637-2. The differences between them indicate that the extant standard might not apply to the test of the truck crane.

In order to meet these special demands simultaneously, which are almost impossible before by using traditional method, a novel optical electric integrated electric field sensor is introduced and implemented in this paper. Firstly, the three generation of the development of the electric field measurement is introduced. Secondly, the characteristics of traditional electric field measurement methods and novel measurement method based on electro-optic effect are compared briefly. Third, the disadvantages of individual optical devices measurement system based on electro-optic effect and the novel measurement system based on integrated optical electric sensor are analyzed. The design theory and implementation of the novel optical electric integrated electric field sensor are illustrated carefully based on the analysis of the structure and key parameters of the sensor. And the input/output characteristics of the sensor have been obtained too. By the characteristic analysis, this kind of novel sensor is suitable for insulated, intensive (> 300 kV/m), small size (300 mm 2 mm 1 mm) and wide frequency band (1 GHz) electric field measurement. Finally, two typical experiments, the transient field of impulse on rod-plane gap before and after breakdown, and the electric field near the insulators are introduced. As above sample, the widespread use of this novel integrated optical electric sensor in high voltage measurement and research work and power frequency intensive field measurement can be expected.",

In this paper the corona losses calculation method of AC transmission lines based on charge simulation method is improved. The AC conductors are represented by discrete infinite line charges When the value of conductor surface electric field exceeds the onset value, some ration charges emit to the space from the conductor surface . The AC cycle is divided into some durations. In each discrete time step the conductor surface charge emission, space charge displacement, space charge recombination were repeatedly calculated for some periods until the ionized field stable. The major contribution of this paper is the algorithm improvement on corona onset criterion and charge emission. The influence of the conductor surface field uniformity on corona discharge was counted in, so that the ion flow field of multi-phase or bundle conductors can be simulated and the lines corona losses can be obtained. The corona losses of a 3 phases 8 bundle conductors HVAC transmission line was calculated and the calculation result was compared with the experimental result.",

        "abstract": "Electromagnetic environment effect of coronas of UHV transmission lines, including radio interference and audible noise, is a key issue in the design and operation of transmission lines. Those prediction formulas in literatures are not always suitable for the case of UHV conductors used in China and need to be verified by the practical UHV power engineering. Therefore, it is necessary to experimentally study the corona environment effect of ac UHV transmission lines. With the UHV test cage, corona effect of the bundle used in 1000 kV UHV AC test demonstration project of China is measured. The generated AN power density and RI excitation function of UHV bundle are obtained by the UHV cage test data. Through the experiments of UHV corona cage, audible noise generation quantity and radio interference excitation function of UHV bundles used in China are obtained. Corona performance tests on UHV AC test line and research on equivalence between short test line and actual long line are performed. A correction of -5.8 dB for 0.5 MHz radio interference is proposed. Compared with experimental results of UHV test line, the validity of UHV corona cage tests is verified. Effects on corona performance of bundles from weather condition, surface gradient of conductor, diameter of sub-conductor, split space and split number are studied in detail. Methods for predicting audible noise and radio interference generated from UHV lines are proposed, which are suitable for actual situation of China. Finally, the prediction formulae for corona effects presented in this paper are shown to be valid with the example of the first 1000 kV UHV AC test demonstration project in China. Prediction formulae for corona performance of different countries are analyzed.",

The world-wide use of charge-coupled device high speed camera provides a powerful tool for researching leader development velocity. Based on photographs of long air gap discharge taken by two high speed cameras synchronously, the three dimensional spatial structure of leaders can be reconstructed according to images process method, which is helpful for researching leader length and velocity. According to observing leader propagation process in 12 m air gaps under positive switching voltages in atmospheric pressure, the development styles of leader can be divided into two parts, namely, steady style and sudden-jump style. The leader development velocity in one-dimension, two-dimension, and three-dimension is also analyzed quantitatively, average one-dimensional velocity is 1.8 cm/\u03bcs, average two-dimensional velocity is 2.03 cm/\u03bcs, and average three-dimensional velocity is 2.3 cm/\u03bcs. When leader channels develop in sudden-jump style, the lengths of leader channels increase sharply, the speed of leader channels increases with large variances, in the range of 10 cm/\u03bcs to 30 cm/\u03bcs.",

Due to the large tower height up to 90 m and the high operation voltage up to 1000 kV, the shielding failure probability increase obviously. Nowadays the leader progression model is an advanced method to evaluate the shielding failure probability of transmission lines. The surface electric field is the key issue for lightning failure analyzing, because the upward leader inception mainly depends on the surface electric field. In this paper, the lightning leader model is introduced. A charge simulation method based piecewise linear function is adopted to analyze the surface electric field on phase conductors and ground wires. The influence factors, such as operation voltage, lightning peak current, lightning down leader position, protection angle, on surface electric field were analyzed. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The adoption of loop topological structure in power distribution network is a popular choice in many cities for its high reliability in power supply. The complexity in the loop network increases difficulties in fault handling and recovery, which is a main obstacle in the implementation of loop network DA. Two modes of fault handling are introduced in this paper and the characteristics of them are discussed. Strategies for the fault isolation and recovery are introduced then. The design and implementation for a complex-network DA, which are applied in a reconstruction project in a power supply company, are introduced in details. The application of feeder terminal units (FTUs) in the supervision and control of the network is the critical technology to implementation of DA. Thus, fault can be detected and fault signals are transferred to the control center promptly. Fault handling and recovery are processed in the control center, and trip commands are executed. And the robustness in these operations is also considered.",

Analyzing a lot of experimental results, we observed the characteristics of power losses of ZnO varistors can be classified into three types according to applied experimental temperature and applied voltage: (1) the power loss steeply rises with the time and leads thermal breakdown, when ZnO varistors has a bad performance, (2) the power loss first quickly rises with the time, and then slowly increases with the time, and at last sharply rises with the time and leads thermal breakdown; (3) the power loss first rises with the time, and then decreases and slowly reaches a stable value with the time. The aging mechanisms for three different aging types of ZnO varistors were discussed based on the changing of Schottky barrier and the migration of zinc interstitials inside ZnO grains, and heat treatment effect.",

If the lightning current is large enough, soil will be ionized, which will have a great effect on the transient performance of the grounding system. In this paper, an efficient time domain method is proposed to analyze the transient performance of the grounding system. The method takes account of nonlinear soil ionization, the shielding effect among electrodes, and frequency-dependent parameters all together. First, a frequency domain circuit model is set up based on a moment method coupling with circuit theory. Then, the model is approximated by a frequency-independent circuit model with the help of vector fitting method. Finally, the time-varying soil ionization is considered by making corresponding parameters time-varying when a time domain method is used to solve the circuit model. The method is validated by field test.",

However, its applicability remains to be proved for the 800-kV HVDC projects in contemplation in China. The ground-level electric field and ion current density are calculated with an upwind differential-based 2-D method and a Deutsch assumption based on the 1-D method to analyze the errors of the ion-flow field caused by Deutsch assumption. A dc bipolar line laboratory model is established to verify the methods. The parameters indicating the corona discharge intensity and the field distortion degree are introduced to evaluate the errors caused by Deutsch assumption. Then, the applicability of the Deutsch assumption is discussed on the 800-kV HVDC test line established in China. The relationship of the corona discharge intensity, the field distortion degree, and the errors caused by Deutsch assumption are analyzed. Using the corona discharge intensity to evaluate the errors caused by Deutsch assumption seems to be reasonable.",

The analysis indicates that the calculation results depend sharply on whether considering ground conductivity. Moreover, we analyze the influences of peak value and the rise time of lightning current, the distance between lightning striking point and distribution line, and other factors on the induced voltage level. The statistical evaluation results of the maximum lightning-induced voltage are presented when considering indirect and direct lightning strikes under different ground conductivities, the results include the probability distribution of peak value of induced voltage and flashover rate per 100 km per year.",

        "abstract": "If surge protection devices (SPDs) are installed without consideration of the concept of lightning protection zones, the equipment to be protected might be damaged despite the correct energy coordination of SPDs. This damage is induced by the reflection phenomena on the cable connecting an external SPD and the load protected. These reflection phenomena depend on the characteristics of the output of the external SPD, the input of the loads, and the cables between the load and the external SPD. Therefore, the SPD has an effective protection distance under the condition of the specific load and the specific voltage protection level of SPD. In this paper, the equipment with different load characteristics and SPDs with different voltage protection levels are analyzed combinatorially under the operation of the surge combination wave. The influence of voltage protection level on the effective protection distance is discussed. Moreover, the effective protection distance of the SPD with the same parameter in a different voltage protection level is also analyzed in detail. The analyzed results show that the effective protection distance would be very long if the impedance of equipment is close to or smaller than the characteristic impedance of the connecting cable.",

In this work, the coupled DC and AC electric field effects are analysed with a reducedscale model. Improved measuring methods are proposed to obtain both the DC and AC components of the ground level electric field and ion current density. Depressing effects of the AC field on the ground level DC field and of the DC field on the ground level AC field are observed when the applied DC voltage exceeds the onset value. The mechanism of the influences of AC power lines on the nearby DC power lines is analysed with experiments and simulations. Both the influence of the AC field on the corona onset on the surfaces of DC conductors and the influence of the AC field on the motion of the space charges are proved to be important in the field effects under the hybrid lines. \u00a9 The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.",

        "abstract": "The line surge arrester can effectively improve the lightning protection performances of transmission lines by eliminating the insulator flashover. If the line arrester is very close to the insulator string in parallel, the lightning discharging would take place in the gap between the upper discharging ring of the line arrester and the bottom grading ring of the insulator string, there is no discharging in the series gap of the line arrester. Sometimes, the insulator string would have a flashover, the line surge arrester cannot provide protection for the insulator string. This so-called ldquotransverse dischargerdquo phenomenon is caused by the proximity effect of the discharging ring of the line arrester. This phenomenon is explained in this paper, and the transverse discharge phenomenon is simulated in high voltage laboratory. The demanded minimum distances between the 110-kV and 220-kV line arrester and insulator string protected are proposed from experimental results.",

Four coupling mechanisms among conductors, namely, inductive coupling, resistive coupling, conductive coupling, and capacitive coupling, are all considered. In comparison to the method based the electric-field integral equation and the method of moments, the new formulation has several attractive features: 1) it is accurate from dc to MHz and it does not have the low-frequency breakdown problem when part of the thin-wire structure is exposed in the air; 2) it has a time-domain form and can be easily implemented in a circuit-simulator with external components connected; and 3) it is much faster because the inverse of the system matrix only needs to be evaluated once. The method is developed based on ElectroMagnetoqQuasiStatic assumption, therefore it is suitable for thin-wire structures with relatively small spatial scales. As an application, the method is used to simulate the lightning transients on a building with a lightning protection system and a simple TN-C-S power supply system. The protection effectiveness of the surge protective devices is evaluated.",

        "abstract": "The transient characteristics of groundings are decided by the impulse breakdown characteristics of soil, thus, the influence of soil ionization neighboring the grounding electrodes should be considered in the accurate lightning protection analysis. The breakdown delay is an important parameter of soil impulse characteristics, which are closely related to the soil properties. In this paper, the impulse breakdown delay of soils under varied temperatures and moistures were tested and the impacts of the amplitude and polarity of the applied impulse, the temperature and moisture of the tested soil samples on the breakdown delay were analyzed. A concept of critical breakdown delay of soil was proposed. From our tests, the soil breakdown under impulse is possibly an electrical but not a thermal process. According to the electrical breakdown mechanism of soil and the impulse breakdown mechanism of gas, the main conclusions were explained. \u00a9 2011 IEEE.",

The ac withstand characteristics of the secondary cables and devices are experimentally investigated and discussed in this paper. The insulation breakdown mechanism of relays can be classified into three modes: air gap breakdown, creeping discharge, and solid insulation breakdown, that of the microcomputer protection device is solid state component damage. The ac power-frequency breakdown voltages of the microcomputer protection device, the small-size electromagnetic and solid-state relays all are as low as about 2 kV. The statistic method to obtain the withstand voltage of long communication cable from experimental data of short cables is proposed. The minimum 3-s withstand voltages of secondary system are 6.5 kV and 2 kV, respectively, this should be considered in substation design. What's more, the volt-second characteristics of the power-frequency withstand voltage of the secondary cables and devices are analyzed and compared in detail, which would be important in the selection of secondary cables and devices. At last, the method how to guarantee high ac breakdown voltage of electromagnetic and solid-state relays and microcomputer protection device is suggested.",

However, when the operation voltage reaches 800 kV and the tower height is near 100 m, the influence of operation voltage may not be ignored. In this paper, an experimental system consisting of an air gap between a plate/rod and a conductor was established, where the dc voltage could be applied to the conductor and was accompanied by a negative impulse voltage on the plate/rod electrode. An upward leader up to 1.54 m in length was observed, and the leader velocity and charge density were obtained in a 11-m-long air gap, whereas the voltage on the conductor was 800-kV dc. The influence of dc operation voltages on the upward leader was studied. The experimental results showed that the upward leader will emerge much earlier and may progress longer with dc operation voltages. That is, the lightning attachment to the conductor may occur more easily when the voltage of the conductor is opposite in polarity to that of the downward lightning than when the conductor has no operation voltage.",

        "abstract": "In order to reduce the electric field strength at the insulator ends, grading rings are installed at the ends of insulators. In this paper, a model coupling the indirect boundary-element method to the moment method is developed to calculate the electric-field distribution around the composite insulators at the heads of transmission towers. The heterogeneous media, such as the composite insulators and the filament metal structures such as the transmission towers and the transmission lines, are considered altogether. The effect of the grading ring on the electric fields along the insulator and on the surface of the grading ring is analyzed on the basis of the calculated results on the composite insulators of a 330 kV transmission tower. Analysis results show that increasing the diameter of the grading ring's tube or reducing the diameter of the grading ring can reduce the maximum electric field at the insulator's high voltage end and the maximum electric field on the surface of the grading ring. At the same time, the maximum electric field at the insulator's high voltage end will increase first and then decrease with increasing the shielding depth of the grading ring.",

        "abstract": "Thus far, despite the development of electric field sensors (EFSs) such as field mills, optoelectronic EFSs and microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based EFSs, no sensor can accurately measure an electric field in space due to the existence of space charge and the influence of charge attachment. To measure a spatial synthetic electric field in an ion flow field, a double potential independent differential EFS based on MEMS is proposed. Compared with other EFSs, this method has the advantages of independent potential (without grounding) and the ability to support the measurement of the synthetic ion flow electric field in space. First, to analyse the charge distribution after the sensor is involved exposed to an electric field, a simulation model was constructed. Then, given the redistribution of the spatial electric field in space and the influence of the surface charge on the sensor, the quantitative relationship between the electric field to be measured and that measured by the proposed sensor was obtained. To improve the performance of the EFS, a set of synthetic field strength sensor calibration systems that consider spatial ion flow injection was established. Furthermore, the parameter , which is related to the relative position of the differential chips, was determined. Finally, a series of comparative experiments indicated that the differential EFS highlighted in the present study exhibits good linearity and accuracy.",

The arrester for the 1000-kV ultra-high voltage ac power transmission\n system is designed as tank-type structure.

By comparing several\n design schemes, the most effective method to improve the potential distribution along the varistor column is to increase the\n voltage gradient of the ZnO varistor. Synthesizing several influential factors, the suitable voltage gradient of ZnO varistor\n should be controlled to 435 V/mm, and the resulted nonuniform degree of the potential distribution along the varistor column\n inside the GIS arrester would be controlled smaller than 10%. The result in this paper provides the fundamental technical\n index for the study of the high voltage gradient ZnO varistors.",

When Cr2 O3 is added into ZnO varistor, the breakdown voltage and the nonlinearity coefficient decrease. Cr2O3 increases the leakage current in the breakdown region and reduces the voltage ratio in the breakdown region, which leads to bad electrical characteristics. C-V characteristics show that this deterioration is related to lower barrier height, donor concentration, and interface defect density of the intergranular layer of the O varistor",

The influences of several factors on impulse grounding properties, which mainly include the amplitude of impulse current, the size and structure of grounding device and the soil resistivity, were systematically analyzed by simulating test according to the analogue theory. The impulse grounding resistance decreases with the increases of impulse current and geometric dimension of grounding device, and increases with the soil resistivity. The soil resistivity was changed within a very large range of 100 to 5103 \u03a9m during experiments.

A nonlinear target function is introduced to transform the problem from the analysis of structural parameters to calculating the limited value of the nonlinear target function.

In order to ensure the safety of UHVDC system and reduce the investment, it is necessary to investigate the breakdown characteristic of large radius sphere-plane gap. This paper implemented experiments on three different gap configurations: rod-plane, sphere (R=0.55 m)-plane, and sphere (R=0.75 m)-plane. The 50% breakdown voltages and the current injected into the high voltage electrode were measured. Besides, the discharge process was observed by a high speed CCD camera. Three types of current waveforms related to different streamer progression characteristics were found. With the increase of sphere radius, it can be found that the streamer gradually becomes dominant in the discharge process, which leads to higher average breakdown field, longer streamer length and much more injected charge of first streamer.",

The ultralow operating frequency of the DCBs enables the use of gate-commutated thyristors (GCTs) in the DCBs. This paper proposed a 6-in dual-gate ring commutated thyristor (DGRCT) for the DCB applications. The wafer and package designs of the DGRCT are first presented and discussed, analyzing the principles of the current commutation in the DGRCTs. Subsequently, a DGRCT prototype is fabricated, and experiments are conducted to measure the inductance along the current commutation loop (CCL) of the prototype DGRCT. Finally, a large current interruption experiment is conducted. The results show that the prototype DGRCT reduced the parasitic inductance within the CCL by at least 20% compared to conventional GCTs with single-gate ring design. The maximum current interruption capacity of the prototype DGRCT is no less than 12 kA at T = 300 K, which approaches the fault current interruption requirement in DCB applications for both transmission and distribution levels of dc power systems.",

Based on electromagnetic transient simulation of the first 1000-kV UHV ac transmission line in China, this paper extracted the effective wave information in accordance with the concept of the active part of the waveshape from calculated main types of switching overvoltage. Moreover, based on test results of switching impulse flashover voltages, a practical and accurate method to calculate the risk of failure was presented, which considered the variable characteristics of the insulation strength of the transmission line under different switching overvoltage waveshapes. Evaluation of the results focused on the comparison between two new methods and the traditional simplified method considering the effect of the front time.",

This paper presented some field experimental results, including audible noise, voltage harmonics, and oscillation of the transformer while dc current passes through the neutral point. The relationship between the dc neutral current and those effects were discovered clearly by analyzing these data. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of the dc current distributed under ground and in the ac network, some useful measures to decrease or block the dc current through the neutral point of the transformer, such as the injection of reverse dc current, blocking capacitor, and series resistor are compared. And the series resistor method is chosen after carefully study of its feasibility in the ac power system. The parameters as well as the protection method of the resistor were selected by implementing several large current experiments. Finally, field experiments were carried out to observe the effect of reducing the neutral current with a series resistor device. Experimental results show that series resistor method is a simple structure, low cost, and of high reliability, which can restrain the neutral current effectively.",

        "abstract": "When the HVDC system works in monopole ground return mode, dc current flows through the neutral of ac power transformer with the neutral grounded, which will enhance its vibration and audible noise. In this paper, dc bias experiments on ac power transformers carried out on 500-kV power transformers both in the transformer factory and the substation are described; the experimental results show how the vibration and audible noise of the transformer change under the dc bias current or windings voltage. The frequency characteristics of the vibration and audible noise of the dc-biased transformer are discussed under the conditions with and without loads. The direct connections between the vibration peak value and the dc bias current, and between the sound pressure and the dc bias current are revealed. Long-term online monitoring shows that the vibration of the transformer changes seriously even if there is not a dc system operating in monopole earth return mode, so when we analyze the influence of dc bias on the vibration and audible noise of the transformer, other influential factors should be expelled.",

        "abstract": "As the need for electric power grows continuously, transmission systems with more delivery capability, such as HVDC lines, are also needed. However, one of the biggest obstacles to construct a new transmission system is the obtaining of sufficient right-of-way, due mainly to the economical and ecological reasons. As a consequence, ac and dc transmission lines are to be built in parallel sharing the same right-of-way. In this paper, the electromagnetic interference in a dc line, due to the capacitive and inductive coupling from a parallel ac line in close proximity, is studied in detail. A multiconductor transmission line model is elaborated in the electromagnetic transient program to calculate the induced voltage from an ac line upon a dc line. A method based on Fourier series theory, to obtain the direct current flowing into the converting transformer, is presented. The generated interferences upon the dc line are calculated and analyzed through an example regarding steady state and fault conditions. Finally, the influence of various parameters upon such interferences is discussed. The paper provides an insight on how to control the generated electromagnetic interference in the dc line on account of the induced voltage from the neighboring ac line.",

        "abstract": "Modeling of upward leader inception is important for lightning risk assessment of high voltage transmission systems. The classical thermodynamic model for long gap leader discharge proposed by Gallimberti has been widely adopted for about 30 years and applied to the analysis of unstable upward leader inception, taking gas temperature rising to 1500 K as the criterion. However, the gas dynamic process and heat conduction which have influences on the gas temperature and leader diameter are not fully considered in this model. Theoretical analysis and simplified simulation illustrated that there are a few limitations without taking the two factors into account. In this paper, the gas dynamics and heat conduction have been considered, and a modified one-dimensional thermo-hydrodynamic (1D-THD) model has been proposed to calculate the inception of upward leader. This model also applies to leader channel expansion. Besides, a Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer was set up to observe the gas density variation and radial expansion of heated leader channels. The calculation results of the channel expansion have good agreements with experimental data.",

Each strategy involves of one method for solving Poissonu0027s equation and the other for solving continuity equations, and a total variation diminishing three-stage Runge-Kutta method in temporal discretization. The numerical methods for Poissonu0027s equation include finite volume method, discontinuous Galerkin methods, mixed finite element method and least-squared finite element method. The numerical method for continuity equations is chosen from the family of discontinuous Galerkin methods. The accuracy tests and comparisons show that all of these four strategies are suitable and competitive in streamer simulations from the aspects of accuracy and efficiency. Results show these methods are compatible. By applying any strategy in real simulations, we can study the dynamics of streamer propagations in both 1D and quasi 2D models.",

Lightning protection in Guangzhou power grid has reference role to construction and operation of power grid in other places with frequent lighting in China.

Distribution rule of lighting activities and line lighting trip-out in Guangzhou is analyzed; shielding failure features of typical 500kV power transmission line in Guangzhou are analyzed. The study shows that lighting trip-out frequency has certain relevance to cloud-to-ground lightning frequency. Operation data show that Guangzhou 500kV line shielding failure flash-over rate is 0.125 times / (100 km\u00b7year). Two terrains of plain and mountain are considered. The line shielding failure flash-over rate is 0.108 times / (100 km\u00b7year) according to calculation.",

The proposed model has both acceptable accuracy and computation time requirement, which is suitable for system level circuit simulation and IGCT\u2019s whole wafer modelling work. First, the development of IGCT model is discussed and the one-dimension phenomenon of IGCT is analyzed in the paper. Second, a physics-based compact model of IGCT is proposed. The proposed model of IGCT includes multiple physical effects that are crucial to IGCTs working in high power applications. These physical effects include the impact ionization effect, moving boundary of depletion region during punch-thourgh (PT) and the local lifetime region. The Fourier series solution is applied for the ambipolar diffusion equation in the base region. Third, the proposed model is implemented in Simulink and compared with the model in Silvaco Atlas, a finite-element (FEM) tool. Finally, the proposed compact model of IGCT is validated by experiments.",

        "abstract": "Gate-commutated thyristors (GCTs) are subject to uneven impedances along the current path from GCT circles to the gate contact, which leads to current redistribution between the GCT circles during turn-off. The current redistribution inequality significantly limits the maximum controllable current of GCTs. This paper presents an optimization method for GCT cell arrangement design to minimize the current redistribution inequality. First, the whole GCT wafer model is applied to calculate the inequality of the current redistribution. The whole GCT wafer model is a hybrid model built by physics-based GCT cell models connected with lumped parameter models. The GCT cell models applied here are improved compact models with multiple physical mechanisms, while the lumped parameter models represent the uneven impedances of the GCT circles along the GCT wafer. In order to measure those impedances, a set of physical concentric contact rings are developed. Finally, the Tabu search (TS), a heuristic algorithm, is applied to optimize the GCT cell arrangement. Using the optimization method based on TS, an optimized set of GCT cell numbers for a 4-in GCT wafer is obtained, reducing the inequality of the current redistribution by 20%.",

        "abstract": "As the structure of power grid becomes more and more complex, the previous lightning overvoltage statistical waveform is no longer suitable for the current power system. So the lightning overvoltage need to be measured to restatistic. In this paper, the measuring system based on Pockels effects and a method of waveform processing are proposed to analyze the time parameters of induced overvoltage, including filtering by wavelet transform and identifying induced overvoltage by the degree of similarity between the three-phase waveforms. Furthermore, the front time, the time to half value and the power frequency phase angles corresponding to the moment of induced overvoltage are statistically analyzed to conclude the value with the maximum probability as well as the randomness of the moment of induced overvoltage, which can guide the insulation design and test of power equipment.",

        "abstract": "The leader plays an important role in long-air-gap discharges. In this paper, Mach-Zehnder interferometry and a high-speed video camera were used to observe the dynamic expansion process of positive leaders near the anode in a 1 m air gap. The leader diameters under lightning and switching impulse are obtained through the analysis of interference fringes. The influences of the applied voltage, including the amplitude and the front time, as well as the electrode sizes on leader expansion are obtained and analysed. For a 0.5-cm-diameter cone electrode, when the applied voltage amplitudes are 330-419 kV, the diameters of the leaders are 1.5-2.5 mm at time scales of less than 195 {mu}s, and the diameters increase as the voltage rises. The diameters of the leaders are larger and the expansion rates are higher for shorter front times. The average expansion rates are 72.30-9.54, 28.09-5.05, 14.38-3.02 and 5.73-1.44 m/s for front times of 1.2, 40, 100 and 250 {mu}s for a 0.5-cm-diameter cone electrode. A larger electrode size leads to a wider diameter. A numerical model was employed to analyse the expansion of the leaders, and the calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental data. Based on the model, the mechanism underlying the leader expansion is discussed in detail.",

In this work, we report the shock wave phenomenon in an air-gap leader discharge observed using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a time resolution of several microseconds. The continuous temporal evolution of the shock wave and the plasma channel was recorded and reproduced with a thermo-hydrodynamic model based on the measured current. The wave propagated at nearly the speed of sound, and the simulation results for the shock wave front positions and the plasma channel radius showed good consistency with the experimental measurements. Detailed thermal parameters obtained through the simulation showed that continuous energy injection by the current results in a temporary over-pressure process in the plasma channel and produces the shock wave.",

        "abstract": "We propose an efficient and accurate message passing interface (MPI) based parallel simulator for streamer discharges in three dimensions using the fluid model. First, we propose a new second-order semi-implicit scheme for the temporal discretization of the model, which relaxes the dielectric relaxation time restriction. Moreover, it solves the Poisson equation only once at each time step, while classical second-order semi-implicit and explicit schemes typically need twice. Second, we introduce a geometric multigrid preconditioned FGMRES solver, which dramatically improves the efficiency of solving the Poisson equations with either constant or variable coefficients. It is numerically shown that the solver is faster than other Krylov subspace solvers, and it takes no more than 4 iterations for the Poisson solver to converge to a relative residual of $10^{-8}$ during streamer simulations. Last but not the least, all the methods are implemented using MPI, and the good parallel efficiency of the code and great performance of the numerical algorithms are demonstrated by a series of numerical experiments, using up to 2560 cores on the Tianhe2-JK clusters. A double-headed streamer discharge as well as the interaction of two streamers is studied, using up to 10.7 billion mesh cells.",

To overcome this problem, hybrid DC circuit breaker (DCCB), which serves as a promising solution to the isolation of DC faults, has been developed. However, hybrid DCCB contains a huge number of power semiconductors, which is costly and inefficient especially in MTDC. This paper proposed a novel hybrid DCCB for nodes in MTDC system. By optimizing the topology and corresponding control strategy of traditional hybrid DCCB, the requirement of power semiconductors is reduced without degrading the performance.

Current commutation from the mechanical switch branch to the static DCCB branch is the precondition to interrupt fault currents successfully for the hybrid DCCBs. A current commutation drive circuit (CCDC) is presented in this study, and it has features of low cost, low operating losses and free maintenance. Experiments have been carried out on a unidirectional 44 kV hybrid DCCB prototype with CCDC. The results show the current of 3.4 kA can be commutated by CCDC within 130 \u03bcs, and be interrupted successfully within 2 ms. For a bidirectional 80 kV hybrid DCCB cell, the effectiveness of CCDC is validated with simulations carried out in PACAD. Then, an index is defined to represent the current commutation capability of CCDC and a mathematical model for CCDC is established to calculate the index. To reduce the cost of CCDC with certain current commutation capability, an optimisation method based on genetic algorithm is proposed in this study. According to the optimisation results of CCDC suitable for bidirectional 80 kV hybrid DCCB cell, the cost of CCDC has been reduced by optimisation.",

        "abstract": "The direct-current (dc) fault-clearance capability of the modular multilevel converter (MMC) is a key issue for overhead line applications of voltage source converter-based high-voltage dc (VSC-HVDC) transmission systems. An MMC integrated with a dc circuit breaker (IDCB-MMC) is proposed to provide a cost-effective DC fault clearance and isolation solution. A mechanical switch (MS) and a load commutation switch are connected in series as the main branch of the dc circuit breaker. DC fault currents can be forced to transfer to converter- and line-side energy absorbing branches when submodule bypass protection and dc circuit breaker interrupting operations are coordinated. Therefore, the bulky and costly solid-state branch that uses numerous semiconductor devices and surge arresters can be eliminated. The dc fault clearance and isolation capability of the IDCB-MMC were verified through the simulation results for one pole of a 1000 MW/\u00b1320 kV VSC-HVDC system. Compared with an MMC that uses half-bridge SMs, the IDCB-MMC only requires few additional capacitors and switching devices and a simple MS, thereby resulting in several advantages, such as low cost, footprint requirements, and additional conduction losses.",

        "abstract": "Turn-off capability of integrated gate-commutated thyristor is highly dependent on the commutation capability of its gate driver unit (GDU). To enhance it, stray impedance is the crucial limitation, which has not been obtained accurately before. Thus, in this paper, acquisition method of impedance based on experimental measurements was carefully analyzed, including electrolytic and ceramic capacitors,  mosfets , printed circuit board, and GCT housing. And each part of stray impedance was obtained based on a series of experiments with 6-inch GCTs and two types of conventional GDUs. To further enhance commutation speed, an improved GDU was developed, reducing the total stray inductance from 0.395 to 0.037 nH, stray resistance from 0.444 to 0.227\u00a0m\u03a9. An extremely high current of 12.5\u00a0kA was successfully turned off, which is the maximum turn-off current level so far. Besides, the maximum commutation capability was tested as over 17\u00a0kA. Consequently, no further optimization of GDU is necessary. However, there was still about 1.0 nH existing inside the GCT housing we used. A novel housing with lower stray inductance is expected for higher commutation speed in the future.",

This paper proposed a bidirectional solid-state switch which is composed of series-connected IGBTs and diode bridges. The solid-state switch has the advantages of low cost, low stray inductance and high turn-off capability, which forms an 160kV/9kA HDCCB together with ultra-fast mechanical switches (MS) and a current commutation drive circuit (CCDC). In this paper, the characteristics of press-pack IGBT, IEGT and IGCT are compared. The turn-off tests of IGBT and IEGT at over 10kA are held. A novel switching module (SM) based on IGBT, diode bridge and external snubber circuits is proposed in order to achieve bidirectional switching with low costs. The series-connected SMs are mounted in a special clamp assembly with high accuracy and uniform pressure distribution. The stray inductance, mechanical property and thermal resistance of the assembly are analyzed. A prototype of the HDCCB demonstrated a successful current interruption within 3 ms at 68.5 kV and 7.2 kA, which verifies the performance of the HDCCB.",

        "abstract": "This paper gives a comprehensive analysis and characterization of power loss of a high-power integrated gate-commutated thyristor (IGCT) in a modular multilevel converter (MMC) for a high voltage dc application. The practical scheme, power loss models, calculation methods, characterization of MMC based on IGCT are analyzed in detail. Especially, a comprehensive comparison of both half-bridge MMC (HB-MMC) and full-bridge MMC (FB-MMC) based on IGCT, press-pack insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), module-type IGBT, press-pack injection enhanced gate transistor (IEGT), and module-type IEGT is analyzed in this paper. According to the study in this paper, the snubber power loss of MMC based on IGCT is far less than the conduction and switching power losses. Both the conduction and switching power losses of IGCT are always lower than that of press-pack and module-type IGBTs and IEGTs in MMC. The power loss of FB-MMC is higher than that of HB-MMC with the same transmission power because more switches are employed in FB-MMC. If taking diodes into account, the HB-MMC and FB-MMC based on IGCT can decrease power loss about 1.9%\u201349.3% and 8.3%\u201345.1% under different operation states, respectively. The study in this paper will provide a valuable reference and promote the application of IGCT in MMC.",

Integrated gate-commutated thyristors (IGCTs) are widely used in high-voltage HCBs due to their controllable turn-off capabilities under high-power conditions. The focus of this study is on the optimisation of gate-commutated thyristors (GCTs) for HCB applications, including operation temperature and design parameters. The considerations of GCT design and operating conditions for the use in HCBs are discussed. Under those considerations, a 2D finite element model of GCT is developed to investigate the influence of the GCT design parameters on the maximum controllable current (MCC) and the safe operation area (SOA). Impedance unevenly distributed along the full wafer has been calculated to obtain accurate simulation results. Results show that the P+-base, lifetime, and the distance between cathode and gate metallisation can all affect the MCC. In addition, GCTs can provide a higher MCC by operating at a higher temperature.",

This paper proposes a modular design methodology based on discrete MOVs of a DCB with series power electronic devices. The modular dc circuit breaker (MDCB) topology and voltage balance issues, the steep front effect and solution, and the design method are proposed and analyzed in this paper. Compared with the traditional DCB, the MDCB has a self-balancing ability, thereby removing the voltage-balancing circuit and reducing the number of series modules. The standard designed cell can be operated as an independent DCB or compose a high-voltage DCB in series flexibly, which decreases the difficulty of design and commission. Finally, a series experimental platform based on an insulated-gate commutated thyristor, an insulated-gate bipolar transistor, and an injection-enhanced gate transistor is built to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed design methodology.",

        "abstract": "Hybrid DC Breakers (HCBs) are crucial components in modern DC systems. Integrated Gate Commutated Thyristors (IGCTs) are widely used in high voltage HCBs due to their controllable turn-off capabilities under high power conditions. The focus of this paper is on the optimization of operation temperature when Gate Commutated Thyristors (GCTs) are applied in HCB applications. The operation conditions of GCTs in HCB are first discussed. Under those considerations, a 2-D finite element model of GCT is developed to investigate the influence of the GCTu0027s operation temperature on the Maximum Controllable Current (MCC) and the Safe Operation Area (SOA). Impedance unevenly distributed along the full wafer has been calculated to obtain accurate simulation results. Results show GCTs can provide a higher MCC by operating at a higher temperature.",

In high power conditions, one of the main failure mechanisms restricting safe operating area for IGCT is the dynamic avalanche during switching off, which is notably amplified by the unbalanced parasitic parameters of different commutation loops. In this paper, the package model of IGCT is established, and the commutation loop inductance of different cathode regions is carefully calculated and analyzed. The result shows good precision by comparison with the experimental result.",

        "abstract": "The problem of upward leader inception from transmission lines has not been thoroughly discussed, largely because of the difficulty to obtain experimental data under natural circumstances. Previous studies have primarily examined reduced-scale experiments or single-phase test lines. In this context, a real-size experimental system aimed at studying upward leader characteristics on both the phase conductor and ground wire is designed in this study. The results associated with real-size experiments corresponding to 110 kV, 220 kV, 500 kV and 1000 kV AC transmission lines, including the phase conductor and ground wire, are presented and discussed. It is shown that as the triggering voltage on the phase conductor increases, the streamer and leader incept earlier for a leader emerging from the phase conductor, and incept later for a leader emerging from the ground wire. The increase of the triggering phase angle corresponds to a higher voltage on the phase conductor, thereby increasing the strike probability on the phase conductor. The leader velocity and charge density present, in general, an increasing trend for the phase conductor as a function of the phase angle, while an opposite trend is observed for the leader emerging from the ground wire except for some special occasions. It is also determined that the phase conductor leader velocity is larger for a higher voltage class, while the charge density associated with the leader emerging from the phase conductor is smaller for a higher voltage class.",

In this study, firstly, an operating \u00b1800 kV DC line is artificially short-circuited to simulate the flashover fault process. The instantaneous voltages and currents and the electrical fields are measured by advanced sensors and high sampling rate recording devices at different points in the converter station, in order to comprehensively study the high-frequency characteristics of the UHVDC system. Then, the portal impedances of the major UHVDC equipment as well as the stray parameters are systematically measured in an actual \u00b1800 kV station. Based on the data measured, the accurate high-frequency characteristics of the \u00b1800 kV converter station are analyzed. The results of the study can be used to guide the EMC and relay protection designs of the UHVDC converter station, so that the stability of the system can be improved.",

        "abstract": "With the development of power electronic devices, solid-state circuit breakers (SSCBs) are likely to replace traditional mechanical breakers and applied to the power system. This paper firstly points out the disadvantages of traditional mechanical breakers. Then, the history of SSCBs has been introduced. The classification, characteristics and working principles of the SSCBs are summarized and shortcomings of different SSCBs are pointed out. This paper introduces the domestic and foreign researches on solid-state circuit breakers, which indicates that studies tend to focus on hybrid solid-state DC circuit breakers in recent years. Based on the applications of SSCBs, different power electronic devices have been compared and the result shows the IGBT-based SSCBs are suitable for a low-current branch while the IGCT-based SSCBs are a good choice for a medium-current branch. Finally, this paper points out SSCBs will develop along a high-power direction and accordingly series-parallel problems of power electronic devices must be overcome.",

        "abstract": "In order to improve the shielding effect of the transmission line, the accurate line system design is significant. The electrogeometric model and leader progression model are two typical and most widely used numerical analysis models to analyze the shielding failure performance. However, both models call for more experimental evidence for accurate application. This paper investigates the characteristics of an upward leader emerging from 110-, 220-, 500-, and 1000-kV single-phase conductors through simulated experiments, and the conductor parameters and heights adopted are similar to the actual transmission lines in operation. The ac voltage generator is connected to the conductor to apply an operating voltage to the conductor. The influence of bundle number and conductor height on the upward leader is also discussed in detail. The obtained characteristics of an upward leader will be helpful to build appropriate numerical analysis models for the shielding failure of the transmission line.",

In this paper, the effect is analyzed by a numerical method, which couples moment method with circuit theory by regarding the coke bed as several resistors connecting the ground electrode with soil. The method is simple and efficient. The calculated results are in good agreement with the measured ones. The current distribution, ground resistance. and step voltage of several typical electrodes with and without coke beds are calculated. The effect of the coke bed on the above parameters is summed up.",

By dividing the communication line into several fictitious segments, a chain composed by the coupling P1-type circuit with distributed source is formed. The enhanced node voltage analysis (ENVA) is also developed in order to evaluate such a kind of model. The ENVA cuts the number of nodes down greatly because of treating the active and coupling impedance branches as a whole. In addition, the transverse voltages in time domain can be obtained easily from those calculated in frequency domain by means of fast Fourier transform. The numerical examples prove the validity and efficiency of the method by comparison with analytical results. The model is of significance to the design and the rights-of-way selection of power lines and communication lines.",

In this paper, we propose a fast tree algorithm that helps to reduce the time complexity from    $O(N^{2})$    (from using direct summation) to    $O(Nlog N)$   . The implementation details are discussed and the time complexity is analyzed. A rigorous error estimation shows the error of the tree algorithm decays exponentially with the number of truncation terms and can be controlled adaptively. Numerical examples are presented to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm.",

        "abstract": "High-temperature capability is critical for polymer dielectrics in the next-generation capacitors demanded in harsh-environment electronics and electrical-power applications. It is well recognized that the energy-storage capabilities of dielectrics are degraded drastically with increasing temperature due to the exponential increase of conduction loss. Here, a general and scalable method to enable significant improvement of the high-temperature capacitive performance of the current polymer dielectrics is reported. The high-temperature capacitive properties in terms of discharged energy density and the charge-discharge efficiency of the polymer films coated with SiO via plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition significantly outperform the neat polymers and rival or surpass the state-of-the-art high-temperature polymer nanocomposites that are prepared by tedious and low-throughput methods. Moreover, the surface modification of the dielectric films is carried out in conjunction with fast-throughput roll-to-roll processing under ambient conditions. The entire fabrication process neither involves any toxic chemicals nor generates any hazardous by-products. The integration of excellent performance, versatility, high productivity, low cost, and environmental friendliness in the present method offers an unprecedented opportunity for the development of scalable high-temperature polymer dielectrics.",

Electrical treeing caused by high, local electric fields is a damaging process that leads to structure degradation and electrical conduction of dielectric materials, and ultimately, to catastrophic failure of the devices. Here, we demonstrate that the addition of less than 0.1 volume per cent of superparamagnetic nanoparticles into a thermoplastic polymer enables the repair of regions damaged by electrical treeing and the restoration of the insulating properties. Under the application of an oscillating magnetic field, the embedded nanoparticles migrate to the electrical trees and generate a higher local temperature, which heals the electrical tree channels in the polymer. Our method allows us to regenerate the dielectric strength and electrical resistivity over multiple cycles of tree formation and healing, which could be used to increase the lifespan and sustainability of power cables for electronics and energy applications.",

In this paper, first the attenuation and deformation characteristics of lightning overvoltage traveling along a 500 kV experimental transmission line are tested. Then the lightning impulse corona characteristics on different bundled conductors commonly used in the 110\u20131000 kV power transmission lines are experimentally investigated, the impulse corona Q\u2013V data measured in the corona cage is transformed into those on the corresponding overhead lines. The influence of bundle geometry on corona is analyzed. Attenuation and deformation effects of lightning impulse corona along transmission lines are evaluated by comparing the simulation and test results. Simulation shows the amplitude and wave-front steepness attenuate remarkably, and the deformation of the voltage mainly happens when the impulse voltage exceeds the corona inception one.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies of streamer discharge branching mechanisms have mainly been generative other than predictive. To predict or even control branching, a reliable connection between experimental conditions and streamer branching needs to be established. As an important step toward the goal, in this work, a 2D deterministic model of negative streamers in air is numerically solved with the ionization seeds assumed as the superposition of Gaussians. The indicative profiles approach developed here can consistently relate the change in a quantitative measure of geometrical irregularity of the seed profiles with specific electron densities to the emergence of front splitting of streamer discharges under various voltages, seed characteristic sizes, and preionization levels. The results of this study could inform experiments to identify and clarify streamer branching mechanisms.",

Based on the electro-optic effect, a small size (mm), wide measuring-amplitude (MV/m), mono-shield structure, integrated electro-optic sensor is designed and developed. The ns-level time domain calibration system of the sensor is established. The calibration result shows that the output electric field is linear with the input signal, and the dynamic response time of the sensor is less than 2 ns. Using the developed sensors, the spatial electric field of a 1-m rod-plane air gap discharge is tested and the sudden step of an electric field is detected. As the imposed voltage increases, the probability and amplitude of the electric field step increased as well. This step phenomenon is confirmed to be the inception and development of a streamer; the confirmation is made by means of simultaneously captured photos. The rise time and the amplitude of the electric field step are discussed. Accordingly, the integrated electro-optic sensor will be a powerful tool for studying the mechanism of air gap discharges.",

This paper presents an isolated ultra-high step-up dc\u2013dc converter in matrix transformer configuration. A flyback-forward converter is adopted as the power cell and the secondary side matrix connection is introduced to increase the power level and to improve fault tolerance. Because of the modular structure of the converter, the stress on the switching devices is decreased and so is the transformer size. The proposed topology can be operated in column interleaved modes, row interleaved modes, and hybrid working modes in order to deal with the varying energy from the wind farm. Furthermore, fault-tolerant operation is also realized in several fault scenarios. A 400-W dc\u2013dc converter with four cells is developed and experimentally tested to validate the proposed technique, which can be applied to high-power high-voltage dc power transmission.",

According to the output characteristics of the SM with the open-circuit fault of IGBT, a fault detection method based on the circulating current and output current observation is used. In order to further precisely locate the position of the faulty SM, a fault localization method based on the SM capacitor voltage observation is developed. After the faulty SM is isolated, the continuous operation of the converter is ensured by adopting the fault-tolerant strategy based on the use of redundant modules. To verify the proposed fault detection, fault localization, and fault-tolerant operation strategies, a 900 kVA MMC system under the conditions of an IGBT open circuit is developed in the Matlab/Simulink platform. The capabilities of rapid detection, precise positioning, and fault-tolerant operation of the investigated detection and control algorithms are also demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a fundamental frequency sorting algorithm for balancing the floating capacitors in modular multilevel converters with low-frequency carrier phase shift modulation. The relationship between the driving pulses and submodules (SMs) is rebuilt in every fundamental period by sorting the voltage increments and present voltages. Besides, an improved and simplified strategy is proposed to predict the charging abilities of the driving pulses, so as to avoid sorting the voltage increments. Based on the proposed method, the switching frequency of each power device and the carrier frequency are identical, which reduces the operational losses for applications regarding high power. At the same time, the sorting frequency is as low as the fundamental frequency, which alleviates a large amount of computational cost, and the necessity to measure arm currents is omitted. In this case, the arm current sensors are eliminated, and simplified communication among the central controller and the local ones is set up. Finally, a three-phase 1-MVA simulation platform with 120 SMs and a down-scaled 6-kVA experimental prototype with 48 SMs are constructed to validate the proposed approach.",

Based on a typical shipboard MVDC system under different grounding modes, the transient short circuit current and overvoltage under monopole ground fault condition are calculated with PSCAD/EMTDC. The impact of the grounding resistance on the fault feature of the system is also studied. According to the comparative analysis and simulation results, a suitable grounding mode and the grounding resistance are proposed. The influences of load conditions, capacitance of loads, capacitance of the transmission cables, resistance between line and ground at the fault point and fault position on the overvoltage are considered. At last, a system protection scheme consisting of grounding mode selection, capacitor, arrester and conjugate mirror filter has been developed.",

As indispensable and important attachments, research on fittings' corona is a significant issue to electromagnetic environment (EME) of DC transmission project. Fittings' surface field strength provides basis of its corona experiment to test its discharge voltage. It would also provides reference about size design and standardized test of fittings. According to few studies over the past decades, this paper presents corona test set-up plan of grading rings on + 800kV UHVDC transmission line to simulate actual situation. Based on Ansoft FEM calculation software, it proposes comparison of surface field strength and its distribution under actual operation and experiment arrangement. Corona onset voltage of specific grading rings is tested. The analysis among theoretical study, simulation and experiment indicates that the onset voltage calculated by Peek's formula is higher than experimental results. Peek's result should be further discussed about the applicability to large-size electrode.",

As the previous works, the problem is solved in time domain with representing the space charges as discrete line charges. In each discrete time step, the procedures of charge emission, space charge displacement, and space charge recombination are simulated. As improvements, the influence of the conductor surface field uniformity on corona discharge is taken into account, so that the ion flow field of multi-phase or bundle conductors can be simulated in this work. The corona losses of a 3-phase 8-conductor bundle HVAC transmission line is calculated. Acceptable agreement is obtained with the experimental results. The ground level total electric field of different line configurations is calculated. The influences of line configurations such as subconductor radius, bundle spacing, number of subconductors, wire spacing, and phase height on ground level total electric field are analyzed based on the calculation.",

        "abstract": "Lightning protection analysis is of vital importance for the transmission system, on which the grounding impedance model has a great effect. This paper concerns the influence of the grounding impedance model on lightning protection analysis. The transmission system is established in PSCAD/EMTP with consideration of three grounding impedance models as constant resistance, standard dynamic resistance and real-time dynamic resistance. The lightning withstand level is simulated and obtained under several typical conditions of soil resistivity and voltage levels. Moreover, the models are comparison and analyzed in the aspects of the dynamic resistance, as well as the ground potential rise and the insulator voltage. This makes a contribution for determining the suitable grounding impedance model applied in the lightning protection analysis, which is very meaningful both in theory and practice.",

The dc current distribution either in ac power grids or in pipelines would be affected by each other. In this paper, a numerical approach to simulate the dc current distribution in ac power grids and gas pipelines considering the interaction is put forward. The approach is validated by field test. The dc current distribution in ac power grids and gas pipelines is discussed based on the calculation result in a real case. It is found that the effect of ac power grids on the current distribution in gas pipelines is greater than the effect of gas pipelines on the current distribution in ac power grids.",

        "abstract": "One of the most important feature of streamers is that they frequently branch during the development process. In this paper, the branching characteristics of positive streamers are experimentally investigated in nitrogen-oxygen gas mixtures. Pulsed voltages with the amplitude of 10\u201320 kV are applied to a point-plane gap. The gas pressure is 100 mbar and the concentrations of the oxygen are 0.01 and 20%. The branch angle, the cross-sectional area of streamer channels before and after branching, as well as the ratio between streamer branching length and width are obtained. It is found that the streamer branching angle for 0.01% oxygen is less than that for 20% oxygen. The average ratio of the streamer cross-section area after branching to that before branching is 0.711 and changes slightly for different oxygen concentrations. The branching ratio decreases significantly from 12.6\u00b12.6 to 6.7\u00b11.5 when lowering the oxygen content from 20% to 0.01%, which indicates that the streamers branch more frequently at a certain distance. Since the nitrogen-oxygen ratio directly decides the electron production rate by photoionization ahead of streamers, the results imply that the possibility of streamer branching may correlate with the photoionization rate in the streamer tip.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new multigrid method to efficiently solve the finite element approximation of static or quasi-static electromagnetic problems with quadratic nodal finite elements on unstructured grids in 2D and 3D by using grid information and p-multigrid. Unlike the traditional algebraic multigrid (AMG), the new method constructs the first level coarse grid from the grid information of the finest grid directly, by using the natural geometrical coarsening relationship between the P2 and P1 elements. Then, the algebraic equations of the first level coarse grid are constructed based on the special relationship between the basis functions of quadratic finite element and its linear counterpart. At last, the traditional AMG is applied to solve the algebraic equations of the first coarse level rather than that of the finest grid. Several techniques of convenient and economic implementation are discussed. For the problems tested, the proposed method is much more efficient than the conjugate gradient method with incomplete Cholesky preconditioning; in addition, compared with traditional Krylov subspace accelerated AMG, the new method may save about 30% to 40% CPU time while achieving the same accuracy in practical computations. \u00a9 2011 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Integrated gate commutated thyristor (IGCT) shows excellent potential in high-power converters owing to its advantages of low on-state voltage, low cost, and high reliability. However, a di/dt limiting inductor and a clamp circuit must be added to IGCT converters to protect the freewheeling diodes (FWD) from severe reverse recovery, leading to additional size and losses. So far, the di/dt is still limited to lkA/\u03bcs in most of the IGCT converters, even the maximum turn-off di/dt of up-to-date fast recovery diodes has already reached up to 5.3kA/\u03bcs. In this paper, the maximum di/dt of both IGCT and diode is studied. The current commutation process of the clamp circuit is analyzed. The switching losses of IGCT, diode and clamp circuit are tested at different di/dt from 1.1kA/\u03bcs to 19.4kA/\u03bcs. Results show that the switching losses of IGCT converters will be reduced by 40% with lower di/dt limiting inductance. A back-to-back power cycling test of two half-bridge IGCT converters at 2200V/1500A and 150Hz verifies the long-term reliability of IGCT converters at maximum di/dt of 5.2kA/\u03bcs.",

        "abstract": "Corona discharge appears near the HVDC lines when the surface electric field strength of the line is higher than the corona incept field. Ion flow will be formed under the affection electric field near conductors. Ion flow is a non-equilibrium plasma at low temperature, they are distributed among lines and the earth. Measurements of the DC synthetic electric field is important for the evaluation of the EMC of electric devices. Among several measuring methods, MEMS sensor is a new but useful one. When a MEMS electric field sensor with packaging is put into the area, charges will accumulate onto the shell of the sensor in a quick transient charging process and generate a reverse field. After the process finished, there exists an \u201cempty zone\u201d near the sensor where no charges in it. This paper studies the charging process of ion flow on packaging shell and the effects it cause, by using FEM simulation method and Multiphysics analysis, to provide theoretical basis for the design of MEMS sensors used for measuring electric field near HVDC. According to this paper, the effect of \u201cempty zone\u201d is lower than that of ion flow, the electric field changes it causes is about 50 V/m at the background target field 15 kV/m, while field changes caused by the ion flow among the area outside the sensor could be several dozen times of it.",

Based on a typical shipboard MVDC system under different grounding modes, the transient short-circuit current and overvoltage under a monopole ground fault condition are calculated with PSCAD/EMTDC. The impact of the grounding resistance on the fault feature of the system is also studied. According to the comparative analysis and simulation results, a suitable grounding mode and the grounding resistance are proposed. The influences of load conditions, capacitance of loads, capacitance of the transmission cables, resistance between line and ground at the fault point, and fault position on the overvoltage are considered. Finally, a system protection scheme consisting of grounding mode selection, capacitor, arrester, and conjugate mirror filter has been developed.",

        "abstract": "High electric breakdown strength of insulating materials is essential to improving the reliability of the electricity grid, reducing the size of electric devices, saving energy, protecting the environment, and reducing costs. Traditionally, dielectric breakdown strength is increased by exploiting its dependence on the thickness of the dielectric material, based on the electron impact ionization and avalanche theory by Townsend (1900) and Seitz (1949) [9]. However, at present there has been little research addressing the role of the transverse dimension (perpendicular to the direction of the electric field) in the avalanche breakdown process, and no results about research in nanoscale. An insulation breakdown prototype of a 1D nanocell was constructed. It consisted of an air-column and Al2O3 solid wall. Based on the analysis and comparison between nanocell geometrical dimensions and avalanche physical dimensions, it was found that the properties of the 1D nanocell diverges from the gas/solid discharge theories of Townsend and Seitz. Along with the I-V results of 1D nanocell by C-AFM (Conductive-Atomic Force Microscope), it was demonstrated that electrical breakdown cannot be caused by electron avalanche in 1D nanocell. The discharge properties of Al2O3 NPT (nano pore template) with nanocells array and when it inserted into the air gap as a barrier were studied to further demonstrate the capability of 1D nanocells on the electrical characteristic of macroscale material. Results showed that the scale effect of nanocells have an obvious role in improving the dielectric breakdown voltage, with singular discharge phenomena identified. This study proposes a new super-insulator prototype of 1D nanocell and supplies a novel thought for constructing high performance nanostructured dielectrics for more wide applications, and provides a scientific basis on the interconnection among Micro-Meso-Macro scales.",

        "title": "High Reversibility of Lattice Oxygen Redox Quantified by Direct Bulk Probes of Both Anionic and Cationic Redox Reactions",
        "abstract": "The reversibility and cyclability of anionic redox in battery electrodes hold the key to its practical employments. Here, through mapping of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (mRIXS), we have independently quantified the evolving redox states of both cations and anions in Na 2/3 Mg 1/3 Mn 2/3 O 2 . The bulk Mn redox emerges from initial discharge and is quantified by inverse partial fluorescence yield (iPFY) from Mn-L mRIXS. Bulk and surface Mn activities likely lead to the voltage fade. O-K super-partial fluorescence yield (sPFY) analysis of mRIXS shows 79% lattice oxygen redox reversibility during the initial cycle, with 87% capacity sustained after 100 cycles. In Li 1.17 Ni 0.21 Co 0.08 Mn 0.54 O 2 , lattice oxygen redox is 76% initial-cycle reversible but with only 44% capacity retention after 500 cycles. These results unambiguously show the high reversibility of lattice oxygen redox in both Li-ion and Na-ion systems. The contrast between Na 2/3 Mg 1/3 Mn 2/3 O 2 and Li 1.17 Ni 0.21 Co 0.08 Mn 0.54 O 2 systems suggests the importance of distinguishing lattice oxygen redox from other oxygen activities for clarifying its intrinsic properties. Battery cathodes based on 3d-transition-metal oxides need viable improvements in their energy density. Recent proposals of O redox have enabled conceptual possibilities, although the assessment of its reversibility remains elusive. This work reports independent and direct quantifications of the evolving O-2p and Mn-3d redox states through O-K and Mn-L mapping of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (mRIXS). The high reversibility of the lattice O redox in Na 2/3 Mg 1/3 Mn 2/3 O 2 (79%) and Li 1.17 Ni 0.21 Co 0.08 Mn 0.54 O 2 (76%) is revealed during the initial cycle. While Na 2/3 Mg 1/3 Mn 2/3 O 2 displays decent O-redox capacity retention (87% after 100 cycles), the Li-rich system shows significant decay (44% after 500 cycles). We demonstrate direct quantifications of the reversibility of lattice O redox through photon-in-photon-out bulk-sensitive mRIXS. The quantification results directly show that the reversibility of lattice O redox could be very high in both Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. Reversibility of lattice oxygen redox holds the key to its practical employments, especially in 3d transition-metal compounds. Here, direct, independent, and quantitative bulk probes of both cationic and lattice anionic redox chemistry are achieved through mapping of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering. We found highly reversible lattice oxygen redox in Na 2/3 Mg 1/3 Mn 2/3 O 2 (79%) and Li 1.17 Ni 0.21 Co 0.08 Mn 0.54 O 2 (76%) during the initial cycle, with 87% and 44% capacity retention after 100 and 500 cycles, respectively. Therefore, aside from other oxygen activities, lattice oxygen redox could be highly reversible in batteries. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "Streamers are the initial stage of electric breakdown in a long air gap. The modelling of streamers in atmospheric air can lay the foundation for the modelling of long sparks and help the insulation design in ultra-high voltage projects. In this paper, a 3D macroscopic model is built to describe the development of positive streamers. This model is based on a discharge tree model, first implemented by Luque and Ebert, which describes the self-consistent charge transport in streamers. The modified model considers the multiple initial streamers, streamer width variation after branching and improved streamer head mobility. More importantly, a new practical branching criterion of positive streamers is proposed. A higher branching possibility is shown if the average photoionization rate ahead of a streamer decreases to a certain critical value. In atmospheric air this critical value is estimated to be 4.5\u00d71019 cm\u22123 S\u22121 from experimental results. We performed a simulation on the development of streamers with tens of centimeters. The calculated results of streamer branching ratio agrees well with the experimental data. The influences of the critical photoionization rate and channel electrical conductance are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Social networks play important roles in information propagation and interactions among friends. Billions of information stream are created by users in Twitter and diffuse among relationship networks. Users may receive mass tweets posted by their followees every week. Thus, how to rank and display the tweets users are interested in and willing to interact with, is necessary to improve useru0027s experience. Information propagation is usually driven by user interaction behaviors including retweet and comment. While these behaviors are mainly affected by the social influence and user interest, which dynamically change with time. In this paper, we propose a tweets ranking model to predict information diffusion based on dynamic social influence and personal interests. Our model combines these factors together by exploiting listwise algorithm such as ListNet. Experiments show that our model performs better than several baseline models, and both social influence and personal interests play important roles in tweets ranking.",

        "abstract": "Dectin-1 is the critical sensor for \u03b2-glucan from Candida which is the most common human fungal pathogen and cause superficial and system infection. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in regulating innate immunity. However, the functional role of miRNAs in inflammatory response dependent on the activation of dectin-1 pathway has not been defined. In the present study, we found insoluble \u03b2-glucan from the cell wall of Candida albicans (CaIG) was able to increase the production of of IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 through Dectin-1-Syk-NF-\u03baB and p38MAPK pathway. MiRNAs profiles combined with real-time PCR validation revealed that miR-146a, miR-30-5p, miR-210-3p expression level were increased in THP-1 cells treated with CaIG. The interaction between Dectin-1 and CaIG resulted in an long lasting increase of miR-146a expression dependent on Dectin-1-Syk-NF-\u03baB, p38MAPK, contrasting with a rapid and transient increase of IL-6 and TNF\u03b1. Overexpression of miR-146a significantly suppressed the production of IL-6 and TNF\u03b1. MiR-146a mimics inhibited CaIG-induced activity of p-I\u03baB\u03b1 and translocation of NF-\u03baB p65. Luciferase reporter assays showed miR-146a inhibited NF-\u03baB promoter-binding activity. Together, our data suggest miR-146a may play the potent negative feedback regulator in inflammatory response following Dectin-1 stimulation.",

        "abstract": "The prevalence of Candida infection induced by Non-albicans Candida (NAC) species is increasing. However, as a common NAC species, C. tropicalis has received much less study in terms of host immunity than C. albicans has. In this study, we evaluated the pro-inflammatory cytokine responses evoked by C. tropicalis and determined whether the dectin-1 receptor and the downstream NF-\u03baB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathways played roles in inflammation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and THP-1 macrophage-like cells. Exposure of PBMCs and THP-1 macrophage-like cells to C. tropicalis led to the enhanced gene expression and secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. THP-1 macrophage-like cells being challenged by C. tropicalis resulted in the activation of the NF-\u03baB, p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathways. We also found that the expression of the dectin-1 receptor was increased with C. tropicalis treatment. These data reveal that dectin-1 may play a role in sensing the inflammation response induced by C. tropicalis, and that NF-\u03baB and MAPK are involved in the downstream signaling pathways in macrophages.",

        "abstract": "Acne is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that often involves the formation of C. acnes biofilms. Several microRNAs (miRNAs) are known to be involved in inflammatory responses. However, it is unknown whether miRNAs play a role in the inflammatory reaction triggered by C. acnes biofilm. Here we investigated the role of miR-146a in biofilm-derived C. acnes induced inflammatory responses. Increased expressions of miR-146a and toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 were detected in acne lesions. In presence of biofilm-derived C. acnes, TLR2 and its downstream NF-kB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways were activated in keratinocytes. Subsequently, miR-146a was up-regulated in these cells along with induction of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1. Further, our data indicated that miR-146a could directly bind the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of IL-1 receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), and suppress their expression, leading to inhibition of biofilm-derived C. acnes induced activation of NF-kB, p38, and Erk1/2 pathways. Overall, our results indicate that biofilm-derived C. acnes induces miR-146a, which can down-regulate the production of IL-6, -8, and TNF-\u03b1 in acne inflammation by inhibiting TLR2/IRAK1/TRAF6/NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways.",

However, whether NCSTN mutations affect miRNA levels and their subsequent signaling pathways in familial AI patients has not been studied. We aimed to elucidate the relationship between NCSTN mutations and familial AI pathogenesis by investigating differential miRNA expression and their related pathways. Combined with miRNA microarray data from familial AI patients, Ncstn keratinocyte-specific-knockout (Ncstn) mice and bioinformatics predictions demonstrated that NCSTN mutations led to decreased miR-30a-3p levels, which negatively regulated RAB31 expression. Moreover, enhanced RAB31 levels accelerated degradation of activated EGFR, leading to abnormal differentiation in keratinocytes. The impaired EGFR signaling and its effects on epidermal differentiation were also observed in familial AI patients and Ncstn mice. Thus, our study revealed that miR-30a-3p/RAB31/EGFR signaling pathway may play a key role in the pathogenesis of familial AI with NCSTN mutations.",

        "abstract": "Abnormal neural activities can be revealed by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) using analyses of the regional activity and functional connectivity (FC) of the networks in the brain. This study was designed to demonstrate the functional network alterations in the patients with pulsatile tinnitus (PT). In this study, we recruited 45 patients with unilateral PT in the early stage of disease (less than 48 months of disease duration) and 45 normal controls. We used regional homogeneity (ReHo) and seed-based FC computational methods to reveal resting-state brain activity features associated with pulsatile tinnitus. Compared with healthy controls, PT patients showed regional abnormalities mainly in the left middle occipital gyrus (MOG), posterior cingulate gyrus (PCC), precuneus and right anterior insula (AI). When these regions were defined as seeds, we demonstrated widespread modification of interaction between the auditory and non-auditory networks. The auditory network was positively connected with the cognitive control network (CCN), which may associate with tinnitus related distress. Both altered regional activity and changed FC were found in the visual network. The modification of interactions of higher order networks were mainly found in the DMN, CCN and limbic networks. Functional connectivity between the left MOG and left parahippocampal gyrus could also be an index to reflect the disease duration. This study helped us gain a better understanding of the characteristics of neural network modifications in patients with pulsatile tinnitus.",

        "abstract": "Background Sigmoid sinus wall reconstruction (SSWR) is a proven effective treatment for pulsatile tinnitus (PT) caused by sigmoid sinus wall dehiscence (SSWD) with or without sigmoid sinus diverticulum (SSD); however, comprehensive analysis of the postoperative imaging manifestations has not yet been reported. Purpose To analyze temporal bone computed tomography (CT) imaging features following SSWR in patients with PT. Material and Methods Following SSWR, temporal bone contrast-enhanced high-resolution CT (HRCT) images from 33 PT cases were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups based on follow-up interval: a short-interval group (\u226418 months, 12 cases) and a long-interval group (>18 months, 21 cases). The mending material density and morphology was analyzed. Postoperative changes of the venous sinus were evaluated. Imaging manifestations of the normal temporal bone and mastoid air cells adjacent to the operative field were observed. Results The order of CT values of mending materials was significantly lower in the short-interval group than in the long-interval group (Z\u2009=\u2009-4.716, P\u2009<\u20090.001); the incidence of complete newly remodeled cortical bone on the rim of the mending materials was significantly higher in the long-interval group than in the short-interval group ( P\u2009<\u20090.001). Eleven patients (33.3%) showed varying degrees of remnant SSWD. The mending materials and normal mastoid bone structure showed complete fusion (n\u2009=\u200912, 36.4%), partial fusion (n\u2009=\u200916, 48.5%), or complete separation (n\u2009=\u20095, 15.2%). Conclusion Temporal bone contrast-enhanced HRCT can be used to observe imaging features of the mending materials, venous sinus, adjacent normal temporal bone and mastoid air cells following SSWR.",

        "abstract": "The sigmoid sinus diverticulum (SSD) is an increasingly recognized cause of pulsatile tinnitus (PT). Surgical reconstruction of the sigmoid sinus wall has been found to be highly effective for SSD; however, surgical techniques still need to be refined to reduce the incidence of serious postoperative complications. Moreover, scrutinizing more cases of SSD is desirable for establishing the diagnostic criteria and standardizing the surgical technique. This study was retrospectively undertaken in 28 patients who were diagnosed with SSD upon computed tomography angiography (CTA) and digital subtraction angiography findings at Beijing Tongren Hospital in China. A majority of patients (20/28) presented with SSD and accompanying sigmoid sinus wall dehiscence (SSWD). Twenty-five patients opted to undergo sigmoid sinus wall reconstruction, and 3 patients refused surgery. Following surgery, 17 patients experienced complete resolution of PT, 3 patients experienced partial resolution, and 5 patients experienced no change in PT. No serious complications were found postoperatively. A comparative analysis of the preoperative and postoperative CTA findings suggested that completely resolving SSD and the accompanying SSWD resulted in the elimination of PT. In conclusion, SSD is generally accompanied by SSWD. Sigmoid sinus wall reconstruction is a safe and effective approach for the treatment of SSD. During surgery, completely resolving both SSD and SSWD is advisable, and maintaining the normal diameter of the sigmoid sinus is imperative.",

Here, we utilized rs-fMRI to measure the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in forty patients with unilateral PT and forty age-, gender-, and education-matched normal control subjects. Two different frequency bands (slow-4, 0.027\u20130.073\u2009Hz, and slow-5, 0.010\u20130.027\u2009Hz, which are more sensitive to subcortical and cortical neurological signal changes, resp.) were analyzed to examine the intrinsic brain activity in detail. Compared to controls, PT patients had increased ALFF values mainly in the PCu, bilateral IPL (inferior parietal lobule), left IFG (inferior frontal gyrus), and right IFG/anterior insula and decreased ALFF values in the multiple occipital areas including bilateral middle-inferior occipital lobe. For the differences of the two frequency bands, widespread ALFF differences were observed. The ALFF abnormalities in aMPFC/ACC, PCu, right IPL, and some regions of occipital and parietal cortices were greater in the slow-5 band compared to the slow-4 band. Additionally, the THI score of PT patients was positively correlated with changes in slow-5 and slow-4 band in PCu. Pulsatile tinnitus is a disease affecting the neurological activities of multiple brain regions. Slow-5 band is more sensitive in detecting the alternations. Our results also indicated the importance of pathophysiological investigations in patients with pulsatile tinnitus in the future.",

        "abstract": "The extracellular microvesicles (MVs) are attracting much attention because they are found to be the key paracrine mediator participating in tissue regeneration. Dexamethasone (DXM) is widely accepted as an important regulator in tailoring the differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, the effect of DXM on the paracrine signaling of MSCs remains unknown. To this point, we aimed to explore the role of DXM in regulating the paracrine activity of MSCs through evaluating the release and function of MSC-MVs, based on their physicochemical characteristics and support on osteogenic response. Results showed that DXM had no evident impact on the release of MSC-MVs but played a pivotal role in regulating the function of MSC-MVs. MVs obtained from the DXM-stimulated MSCs (DXM-MVs) increased MC3T3 cell proliferation and migration and upregulated Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and osteopontin (OPN) expression. The repair efficiency of DXM-MVs for femur defects was further investigated in an established rat model. It was found that DXM-MVs accelerated the healing process of bone formation in the defect area. Thus, we conclude that using DXM as stimuli to obtain functional MSCs-MVs could become a valuable tool for promoting bone regeneration.",

        "abstract": "The amniotic fluid has a heterogeneous population of cells. Some human amniotic fluid-derived stem (hAFS) cells have been shown to harbor the potential to differentiate into neural cells. However, the neural differentiation efficiency of hAFS cells remains low. In this study, we isolated CD117-positive hAFS cells from amniotic fluid and then examined the pluripotency of these cells through the formation of embryoid bodies (EBs). Additionally, we induced the neural differentiation of these cells using neuroectodermal medium. This study revealed that the GSK3-beta inhibitor SB216763 was able to stimulate the proliferation of CD117-positive hAFS cells without influencing their undifferentiated state. Moreover, SB216763 can efficiently promote the neural differentiation of CD117-positive hAFS cells towards neural progenitor cells in the presence of DMEM/F12 and N2 supplement. These findings provide an easy and low-cost method to maintain the proliferation of hAFS cells, as well as induce an efficacious generation of neural progenitor cells from hAFS cells. Such induction of the neural commitment of hAFS cells may provide an option for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases by hAFS cells-based therapies. ",

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the correlation between glucocorticoid activity regulation, prostaglandin E2 (PGE) synthesis, and synovial inflammation inhibition activity, through microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) expression regulated by the glucocorticoid pre-receptor regulator, 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (11\u03b2-HSD1). In the present study, fibroblast-like synovial cells of rats were studied as a cell model. Cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 for 24 h, and were subsequently, within the next 24 h, treated with or without 10 mmol/l corticosterone alone or with 100 nmol/l PF915275. At the end of the second 24 h, PGE levels in culture supernatants were assayed. Cells were harvested for mRNA evaluation of 11\u03b2-HSD1, mPGES-1, IL-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and protein detection of 11\u03b2-HSD1 and mPGES-1 using reverse transcription-qualitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. Corticosterone was demonstrated to suppress the mRNA expression levels of inflammatory factors, such as TNF-\u03b1 and PGE, induced by IL-1\u03b2 . Simultaneously, expression levels of 11\u03b2-HSD1 decreased significantly at the mRNA and protein levels (P<0.05). Cortisol concentration in the medium of the group treated with corticosterone was significantly increased (P<0.05) compared with that of the control group; however, the cortisol concentration was decreased in the medium when the conversion bioactivity of 11\u03b2-HSD1 was inhibited by PF915275, while the changes in 11\u03b2-HSD1 and mPGES-1 mRNA expression levels and PGE content were reversed in the medium. These results indicated that a significant positive correlation (P<0.01) may exist between mRNA and protein expression levels. To conclude, 11\u03b2-HSD1 is a key regulator for the synthesis of mPGES-1 and PGE in the inflammatory synovial cells , suggesting a potential interference target for osteoarthritis.",

        "abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate the expression patterns of prothymosin-\u03b1 (PTMA) and parathymosin (PTMS) in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), adenosquamous cell carcinoma (ASC) and adenocarcinoma (AC) of the gallbladder, and to assess their association with the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of the patients. A retrospective analysis of data pertaining to patients with SCC/ASC (n=46) and AC (n=80) of the gallbladder, who were treated with surgical resection, was conducted. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was also performed to assess the correlation of the expression pattern with survival. The results revealed a higher percentage of patients with a large tumor diameter (>3 cm) in the SCC/ASC group as compared with those in the AC group (P<0.05). No significant differences were observed between patients with SCC/ASC and those with AC with respect to the patient sex, presence of gallstones, TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, invasive growth into anatomically contiguous structures, surgical methods used, survival rate, and the expression levels of PTMA and PTMA (P>0.05). However, positive expression of PTMA and PTMA was associated with tumor size, TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, locally invasive growth, and treatment with radical resection in patients with SCC/ASC and AC (P<0.05). In addition, positive expression of PTMA and PTMA was observed in a significantly lower number of patients with advanced AC as compared with those in early AC (P<0.05), while these expression levels were also associated with shorter survival in the SCC/ASC group and AC group (P<0.05). Cox multivariate analysis also demonstrated a negative correlation between PTMA and PTMA levels, and the postoperative survival rate in the two groups. In conclusion, the present study indicated that the expression levels of PTMA and PTMA were closely associated with the tumorigenesis and progression of SCC, ASC and AC of the gallbladder. Positive expression of PTMA and PTMA may serve as a valuable prognostic factor in these patients.",

        "abstract": "Backgrounds u0026 AimsIndividualized tacrolimus treatment can improve drug safety and efficacy. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association of donor and recipient small ubiquitin-like modifier 4 (SUMO4) rs237025 polymorphisms with tacrolimus elimination and the potential mechanism.MethodsA total of 297 liver transplant patients were enrolled in the study. CYP3A5 rs776746 and SUMO4 rs237025 were genotyped using TaqMan SNPs assays. The activity of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) was evaluated by luciferase assay. The expressions of CYP3A5 were detected by qRT-PCR and western blotting.ResultsTacrolimus C/D ratios was significantly lower for donor SUMO4 rs237025 AA carriers than AG/GG carriers at weeks 1, 2, 3. In multivariate analysis, donor and recipient CYP3A5 rs776747, donor SUMO4 rs237025 and total bilirubin were independent predictors of tacrolimus C/D ratios in the early post-transplantation period both in Cohort A and Cohort B. When combined donor CYP3A5 rs776746 and donor SUMO4 rs237025 genotypes, tacrolimus C/D ratios was highly significant at all investigated time points within the four groups. CYP3A5 mRNA expression in liver tissues was significantly higher for AA carriers than AG/GG patients under inflammatory stimuli after liver transplantation (LT). Furthermore, we demonstrated that SUMO4 rs237025 G allele could increase NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity under inflammatory condition. And activation of NF-kB suppressed the expression of pregnane X receptor (PXR)-mediated CYP3A5 gene.ConclusionsDonor SUMO4 rs237025 genetic variant was associated with higher Tac C/D ratios in the early period after LT, which might be related to the down-regulation of CYP3A5 enzyme through the NF-kB signaling pathway.This article is protected by copyright.

        "abstract": "A one-step, accelerated reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) procedure was developed for the detection of Melon yellow spot virus (MYSV). The four primers required for accelerated RT-LAMP were designed to anneal onto a conserved region in MYSV N gene. Reaction temperature, optimal Mg concentration, and the ratio of outer/inner primers affected reaction efficiency. MYSV RT-LAMP optimal reaction parameters were obtained in this study. The RT-LAMP was specific and sensitive in detecting MYSV in 60\u00a0minutes, with a detection limit of 0.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0\u03bcg total RNA per reaction, and a ladder-like pattern observed after agarose gel electrophoresis. RT-LAMP was 100-fold more sensitive than the conventional one-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using serial dilutions of total RNA. RT-LAMP was a specific, sensitive, and low cost diagnostic tool that should be of value in more accurate determination of the distribution and host range of MYSV.",

The system has two phase locked loop(PLL) frequency sources which provide local oscillator(LO) signals for frequency conversion. In order to realize a high isolation design, the circuits of two PLL and mixer were divided into three independent cavities through a \u2018T\u2019 shape crosser. Base on the techniques of vertical via and inner route for PCB multilayer, almost all of the power distribute network was emdedded into inner layer, and the system layout realized a compact and high density design at the principle of shortest RF route. A transition structure of CPWG-SL-CPWG was put forward to interconnect the LO signals which can decline the EM couple. The size of the system board is 14.3mm*15.2mm*1.3mm, which is much smaller than a traditional product. The isolation between two LO from RF output is 82.6 dB, which agree with the simulation well.",

In simulation, the thermal power of the amplify is set as 3.3 Watt, the power of the three frequency multipliers and the three LNAs are 0.9 Watt and 0.625 Watt per chip respectively, the whole tharmal power of the seven chips is about 7.9W. Transient thermal analysis also was performed, the simulated result shows that the tempreture of the SiP rises to steady state at about one thousand seconds after work start, the highest tempreture in the SiP is about 60\u00b0C and the hot point is localed on the power amplify chip. Thermal-stress also was simulated under the steady-tempreture distribution, the maximum stress is 682MPa and locates at the edge of the molybdenum-copper plate, this is caused by the large difference of thermal expansion coefficient between the molybdenum-copper and the aluminium alloy material. The stress in silicon baseboard caused by warping is a most potential crack risk in the SiP, the maximum stress in the sillicon baseboard is about 136MPa, it locates at the top edges of the silicon MEMS cavities for embeding chips, and the stress is below the crack strength of the silicon material. The normal stress on the bonding regions between adjacent silicon layers ranges from 13MPa to 40MPa, which isnu0027t exceeds the stacked bonding strength. From the simulation, the thermal and structure relibility of the SiP was checked, which is conducive to reduce failure risk during SiP works.",

In this paper, we analyzed theoretically how the air breaks down between the pin to plate electrodes firstly, and then two essential judgment conditions for breakdown were put forward. One is that the maximum electric field must reach to the breakdown threshold to produce plasma and another is that the average electric field is strong enough to support the charged particle evolve a short stream path between two electrodes. According to two judgment conditions, we made failure analysis of the continuous microwave air breakdown for cavity filter with redundant substance which varying with diameter, length, and rotation angle. It is found that the greater length and smaller diameter the reminder, the formation of breakdown occurs more easily. So, suggestion for quality test standard is concluded that the length of the redundant substance must be smaller than 0.63mm at a 20dBm continuous microwave input.",

From physics-based equivalent circuit modeling approach, the equivalent circuit are related to the geometry directly, which is an efficient and intuitive analysis method. The matching pads and anti-pads are employed and optimized to realize impedance matching of vertical transition at a certain frequency range. Furthermore, in order to mitigate the radiation loss and the propagation of parallel-plate mode, the relationship between the signal transition performance and the distribution of ground vis is obtained. Based on above analysis, a millimeter-wave low loss microstrip-to-microstrip vertical via transition is designed and simulated by high-frequency simulator structure (HFSS).

Due to the compact size and high frequency selectivity, the substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) structure loaded with complementary multiple split-ring resonators (CMSRR) is adopted to design the diplexer which behaves as a fundamental frequency stabilization and second harmonic extraction elements simultaneously in oscillator. The principle of diplexer achieves a high isolation between the main feedback-loop circuit and the external load. In order to validate the proposed structure, an X-band prototype is designed and measured. The simulated frequency pulling effect of harmonic oscillator is decreased significantly compared to the fundamental frequency oscillator counterpart based on SIW-CMSRR filter. The measured results show that, the suppression fundamental frequency component is \u221227.9 dBc in harmonic oscillator, and the phase noise is \u2212114.2 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset frequency from 9.31 GHz carrier, which is 2.6 dB better than the output of fundamental frequency oscillator followed by an ideal frequency doubler.",

Surgical incisions and drainage as well as the removal of necrotic tissues were performed for patients with grades II and III. Immediately after surgery, PDT was performed. Their average Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) was 24.14\u00b14.26 before the surgery and 4.86\u00b12.79 5 months after treatment, respectively. Scale (VSS) scores for evaluating scar formation were low to moderate after surgery and PDT.

Therefore, surgery combined with PDT was applied to treat 7 cases of patients in this study, and treatment efficacy was observed. Simple surgical incisions and drainage were performed for patients with Hurley grade I. Surgical incisions and drainage as well as the removal of necrotic tissues were performed for patients with grades II and III. Immediately after surgery, PDT was performed. Their average Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) was 24.14\u00b14.26 before the surgery and 4.86\u00b12.79 5 months after treatment, respectively. Scale (VSS) scores for evaluating scar formation were low to moderate after surgery and PDT. The experience of treating these 7 patients suggests that surgery combined with PDT might have a more pronounced effect, with the possible advantages of faster healing and less scarring.",

This review focuses on the recent advances in the synthesis of spiroheterocycles by using the strategy of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis, and is organized based on the stereoselectivity and the reactive intermediates. According to the stereochemistry, this review was divided into two main parts, covering racemic and enantioselective versions. In each part, we firstly describe the synthetic transformations using nucleophilic Breslow intermediates, and then discuss the reactions that employ electrophilic acylazolium or radical cation intermediates. With those distinct catalytic activation modes of NHC organocatlysis, we expect this synthetic protocol will possibly produce new molecules with structural novelty and complexity, which may warrant further research in the field of drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "Endo-1,4-\u03b2-D-glucanase (EG), as a key constituent of cellulase taking the responsibility of cutting \u03b2-1,4 glycosidic bonds, plays the essential role in the process of degrading cellulose by cellulase. Cloning and expressing the EG gene is important to the cellulase research and application. In this work, a novel EG gene was cloned from Trichoderma virens ZY-01, which was a cellulase secreting microbe isolated by our laboratory. The DNA sequence showed that the length of the cloned EG is 1069\u00a0bp, which had 95.2% similarity to the EG IV from T. viride AS 3.3711. Further, the expression vector pET-32a-EG was constructed and was successfully heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. The expression product was purified with Ni affinity chromatography and its enzymatic properties were investigated. The SDS-PAGE showed the target protein is 39\u00a0kDa, which is consistent with the translated result from the DNA sequence. The kinetic parameter for the expression product was K\u00a0=\u00a013.71\u00a0mg/mL and V0.51\u00a0\u03bcmol/min\u00b7mL. The optimal reaction pH and temperature was pH\u00a0=\u00a07.0 and T\u00a0=\u00a040\u00a0\u00b0C, which is similar to the native EG produced by Trichoderma virens ZY-01. It provides the foundation for the endo-1,4-\u03b2-D-glucanase further evolution and application.",

        "abstract": "Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) is an invasive floating plant that has caused many environmental problems in Asia. Efficiently removing and utilizing this biomass has become an urgent issue. In this work, the composition of water hyacinth biomass (WHB) was analyzed with the Van Soest method. The combined cellulose and hemicellulose content reached 58.6%, and the lignin content was very low compared with other biomass. An efficient alkali pretreatment technology for WHB was developed, and the enzymatic hydrolysis of WHB to reducing sugars was investigated. With favorable hydrolysis conditions for the alkali-pretreated WHB, the cellulose conversion rate reached almost 100%. Structural changes resulting from WHB pretreatment and hydrolysis were analyzed by Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy. This work demonstrates that WHB is an alternative cellulose source for bioenergy production.",

In spite of the presence of anti-obesity agents on the market, the application of these drugs is limited because of their typical side effects. More effective and safe weight-loss drugs are being pursued by many researchers, correspondingly, growing small molecules and natural products with anti-obesity effects have been identified and the molecular mechanisms underlying the action of novel and known compounds have at least partially been revealed. Therefore, the field does witness great progress year by year. In this review, we intend to provide a comprehensive and updated view on the known and novel compounds which possess anti-obesity effects, and further classify them according to the molecular mechanisms of their actions in regulating the major anti-obesity pathways.",

        "abstract": "Conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) are usually obtained as amorphous or semicrystalline powders. Their insolubility and nonprocessability are considered as key bottlenecks that impede CMP applications. In this study, light-emitting, nanofibrous films were fabricated by electrospinning CMP/poly(lactic acid) (PLA) mixtures. The resulting nanofibrous films show a high flexibility combined with high porosity and surface-area-to-volume ratios. The CMP-based nanofibrous films have been used as sensitive sensors in the detection of nitroaromatic and benzoquinone vapors as well as oxidizing metal ions. Moreover, 4-iodophenyl-substituted graphene sheets were used as templates for growing CMP/graphene sandwiches. The graphene-based CMP (G-CMP) sandwiches are characterized by high surface areas and aspect ratios. Furthermore, hierarchically porous two-dimensional carbon nanosheets were obtained by pyrolysis of these carbon-rich G-CMP hybrids. The resulting carbon nanomaterials show excellent supercapacitor behav...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Three-dimensional (3D) graphene-based composites can possess exceptional electrochemical performance owing to their unique structure and properties. Herein, a 3D cross-linked hierarchical porous polydopamine (PDA) modified reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/amino functionalized carbon nanotube (CNT-NH 2 ) composites were synthesized via hydrothermal method. The hierarchical electrode incorporates the advantages of 1D nanotube for effective charge transport, 2D graphene nanosheet for fast ion transport and 3D cross-linked hierarchical porous substrate for mechanical stability and flexibility. Attributing to these characters, the obtained rGO/CNT-NH 2 /PDA (GCP) electrode presents a high capacitance (176.2\u202fF\u202fg -1  at 0.5\u202fA\u202fg -1 ) in aqueous 6.0\u202fM KOH electrolyte. Symmetric supercapacitor based on GCP-50 electrodes exhibits a high energy density of 4.22\u202fWh\u202fkg -1  and excellent cycling stability with 98.9% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. Furthermore, the supercapacitors show superior flexibility and stability. The facile synthesis, promising electrochemical results and 3D hierarchical porous nanostructure of GCPs present potential for supercapacitor and other energy storage applications.",

Results of Hoechst 33258 staining and Western blot showed apoptotic cells appeared and changes in the expression of apoptosis-related proteins (upregulation of Bax and caspase-3, downregulation of Bcl-2, and activation of poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase). Moreover, the activities of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 were enhanced in M059 K cells. The inhibiting effect of combined treatment with MP and VC on M059 K cells indicates the mechanism of anticancer activity involved induction of cell apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "Renal fibrosis is a common pathological feature of chronic kidney diseases, and their development and progression are influenced by epigenetic modifications including aberrant microRNA (miRNA or miR) expression. miRNAs have been demonstrated to modulate the aggressiveness of various cancers and have emerged as possible therapeutic agents for the management of renal fibrosis. Transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u2011\u03b21)\u2011induced epithelial\u2011mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tubular epithelial cells serves a role in the initiation and progression of renal fibrosis. Furthermore, recent results indicated that the progression of EMT is reversible. The present study aimed to clarify the role of miR\u2011152 in EMT of the tubular epithelial cell line HK\u20112, stimulated by TGF\u2011\u03b21, using in\u00a0vitro transfection with a miR\u2011152 mimic and to further investigate the underlying mechanism of miR\u2011152 activity. In the present study, miR\u2011152 expression was significantly reduced in TGF\u2011\u03b21\u2011treated HK\u20112 cells, accompanied by an increased expression of hematopoietic pre\u2011B\u2011cell leukemia transcription factor (PBX)\u2011interacting protein (HPIP). Additionally, miR\u2011152 overexpression inhibited TGF\u2011\u03b21\u2011induced EMT and suppressed HPIP expression by directly targeting the 3' untranslated region of HPIP in HK\u20112 cells. Furthermore, upregulation of HPIP reversed miR\u2011152\u2011mediated inhibitory effects on the EMT. Collectively, the results suggest that downregulation of miR\u2011152 initiates the dedifferentiation of renal tubules and progression of renal fibrosis, which may provide important targets for prevention strategies of renal fibrosis.",

Here, we established a mouse model of candidiasis with concurrent oral and vaginal mucosal infection. Two  strains sourced from clinical candidemia (SC5314) and mucosal infection (ATCC62342) were tested in ICR mice. The different combinational panels covering estrogen and immunosuppressive agents, cortisone, prednisolone and cyclophosphamide were used for concurrent oral and vaginal candidiasis establishment. Prednisolone in combination with estrogen proved an optimal mode for concurrent mucosal infection establishment. The model maintained for 1\u00a0week with fungal burden reached at least 10\u00a0cfu/g of tissue. This mouse model was evaluated by in vivo pharmacodynamics of fluconazole and host mucosal immunity of IL-17 and IL-23. Mice infected by SC5314 were cured by fluconazole. An increase in IL-23 in both oral and vaginal homogenates was observed after infection, while IL-17 only had a prominent elevation in oral tissue. This model could properly mimic complicated clinical conditions and provides a valuable means for antifungal assay in vivo and may also provide a useful method for the evaluation of host\u2013fungal interactions.",

        "abstract": "Proteases are typical key enzymes that hydrolyze proteins into amino acids and peptides. Numerous proteases have been studied, but the discovery of metagenome-derived proteases is still significant for both commercial applications and basic research. An unexplored protease gene sep1A was identified by function-based screening from a plasmid metagenomic library derived from uncultured contaminated agricultural soil microorganisms. The putative protease gene was subcloned into pET-32a (+) vector and overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS, then the recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity. The detailed biochemical characterization of the Sep1A protein was performed, including its molecular characterization, specific activity, pH-activity profile, metal ion-activity profile, and enzyme kinetic assays. Furthermore, the protein engineering approach of random mutagenesis via error-prone PCR was applied on the original Sep1A protein. Biochemical characterization demonstrated that the purified recombinant Ep48 protein could hydrolyze casein. Compared with the original Sep1A protein, the best variant of Ep48 in the random mutagenesis library, with the Gln307Leu and Asp391Gly changes, exhibited 2.62-fold activity at the optimal reaction conditions of 50\u00a0\u00b0C and pH\u00a09.0. These results are the first step toward a better understanding of the properties of Sep1A protein. Protein engineering with error-prone PCR paves the way toward the metagenome-derived genes for biotechnological applications.",

        "abstract": "Since protein phosphorylation is a dominant mechanism of information transfer in cells, there is a great need for methods capable of accurately elucidating sites of phosphorylation. In recent years mass spectrometry has become an increasingly viable alternative to more traditional methods of phosphorylation analysis. The present study used immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) coupled with a linear ion trap mass spectrometer to analyze phosphorylated proteins in mouse liver. A total of 26 peptide sequences defining 26 sites of phosphorylation were determined. Although this number of identified phosphoproteins is not large, the approach is still of interest because a series of conservative criteria were adopted in data analysis. We note that, although the binding of non-phosphorylated peptides to the IMAC column was apparent, the improvements in high-speed scanning and quality of MS/MS spectra provided by the linear ion trap contributed to the phosphoprotein identification. Further analysis demonstrated that MS/MS/MS analysis was necessary to exclude the false-positive matches resulting from the MS/MS experiments, especially for multiphosphorylated peptides. The use of the linear ion trap considerably enabled exploitation of nanoflow-HPLC/MS/MS, and in addition MS/MS/MS has great potential in phosphoproteome research of relatively complex samples.",

Another aliquot was directly digested and analyzed by a combination of strong cation-exchange (SCX) and reversed-phase (RP) chromatography prior to tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC/MS/MS). Eventually, 48 and 218 unique proteins were identified from 2DE/MS and 2D-LC/MS/MS, respectively, resulting in a total of 222 unique identified proteins.

In this work, liquid isoelectric focusing (LIEF) combined with 2D-LC-MS/MS was applied to the proteome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This yielded a total of 1795 proteins that were detected and identified by 30 fractions of protein prefractionation. Categorization of these hits demonstrated the ability of this technology to detect and identify proteins rarely seen in proteome analysis without protein fractionation. LIEF-2D-LC-MS/MS also produced improved resolution of low-abundance proteins. Furthermore, we analyzed the characteristics of proteins obtained by LIEF-2D-LC-MS/MS. 1103 proteins with CAI under 0.2 were identified, allowing us to specifically obtain detailed biochemical information on these kind proteins. It was observed that LIEF-2D-LC-MS/MS is useful for large-scale proteome analysis and may be specifically applied to systems with wide dynamic ranges.",

        "abstract": "Subcellular proteomics, as an important step to functional proteomics, has been a focus in proteomic research. However, the co-purification of \"contaminating\" proteins has been the major problem in all the subcellular proteomic research including all kinds of mitochondrial proteome research. It is often difficult to conclude whether these \"contaminants\" represent true endogenous partners or artificial associations induced by cell disruption or incomplete purification. To solve such a problem, we applied a high-throughput comparative proteome experimental strategy, ICAT approach performed with two-dimensional LC-MS/MS analysis, coupled with combinational usage of different bioinformatics tools, to study the proteome of rat liver mitochondria prepared with traditional centrifugation (CM) or further purified with a Nycodenz gradient (PM). A total of 169 proteins were identified and quantified convincingly in the ICAT analysis, in which 90 proteins have an ICAT ratio of PM:CM>1.0, while another 79 proteins have an ICAT ratio of PM:CM<1.0. Almost all the proteins annotated as mitochondrial according to Swiss-Prot annotation, bioinformatics prediction, and literature reports have a ratio of PM:CM>1.0, while proteins annotated as extracellular or secreted, cytoplasmic, endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomal, and so on have a ratio of PM:CM<1.0. Catalase and AP endonuclease 1, which have been known as peroxisomal and nuclear, respectively, have shown a ratio of PM:CM>1.0, confirming the reports about their mitochondrial location. Moreover, the 125 proteins with subcellular location annotation have been used as a testing dataset to evaluate the efficiency for ascertaining mitochondrial proteins by ICAT analysis and the bioinformatics tools such as PSORT, TargetP, SubLoc, MitoProt, and Predotar. The results indicated that ICAT analysis coupled with combinational usage of different bioinformatics tools could effectively ascertain mitochondrial proteins and distinguish contaminant proteins and even multilocation proteins. Using such a strategy, many novel proteins, known proteins without subcellular location annotation, and even known proteins that have been annotated as other locations have been strongly indicated for their mitochondrial location.",

The peptides obtained by trypsin cleavage were analyzed to confirm the amino acid sequence and Asn5 was found to be the N-glycosylation site. The result was further confirmed by N-glycosidase digestion. In addition, the protein and tryptic peptides with and without glycan chain were characterized by mass spectrometry according to the mass difference. The glycopeptide obtained from proteolytic digestion was analyzed and the glycoforms were identified as high-mannose type by tandem MS coupled with alpha-mannosidase digestion.

The differential proteomes of Vero E6 cells with and without infection of the SARS-CoV were resolved and quantitated with two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis followed by ESI-MS/MS identification. Moreover isotope-coded affinity tag technology coupled with two-dimensional LC-MS/MS were also applied to the differential proteins of infected cells. By combining these two complementary strategies, 355 unique proteins were identified and quantitated with 186 of them differentially expressed (at least 1.5-fold quantitative alteration) between infected and uninfected Vero E6 cells. The implication for cellular responses to virus infection was analyzed in depth according to the proteomic results. Thus, the present work provides large scale protein-related information to investigate the mechanism of SARS-CoV infection and pathogenesis.",

Image analysis of silver-stained 2-D gels revealed that 56 protein spots showed significant differential expression in MHCC97-H and MHCC97-L cells (Student's t-test, P < 0.05) and 4 protein spots were only detected in MHCC97-H cells. Fourteen protein spots were further identified using in-gel tryptic digestion, peptide mass fingerprinting and tandem mass spectrometry. The expressions of pyruvate kinase M2, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1, laminin receptor 67 kDa, S100 calcium-binding protein A4, thioredoxin and cytokeratin 19 were elevated in MHCC97-H cells. However, manganese superoxide dismutase, calreticulin precursor, cathepsin D, lactate dehydrogenase B, non-metastatic cell protein 1, cofilin 1 and calumenin precursor were down-regulated in MHCC97-H cells. Intriguingly, most of these identified proteins have been reported to be associated with tumor metastasis. The functional implications of alterations in the levels of these proteins are discussed.",

This study combined the LCM with isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) technology and two-dimensional liquid chromatography to investigate the qualitative and quantitative proteomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The effects of three different histochemical stains on tissue sections have been compared, and toluidine blue stain was proved as the most suitable stain for LCM followed by proteomic analysis. The solubilized proteins from microdissected HCC and non-HCC hepatocytes were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed with two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS/MS) alone or coupled with cleavable ICAT labeling technology. A total of 644 proteins were qualitative identified, and 261 proteins were unambiguously quantitated. These results show that the clinical proteomic method using LCM coupled with ICAT and 2D-LC-MS/MS can carry out not only large-scale but also accurate qualitative and quantitative analysis.",

        "abstract": "Mesangial cells (MC) play an important role in maintaining the structure and function of the glomerulus. The proliferation of MC is a prominent feature of many kinds of glomerular disease. The first reference 2-DE maps of rat mesangial cells (RMC), stained with silver staining or Pro-Q Diamond dye, have been established here to describe the proteome and phosphoproteome of RMC, respectively. A total of 157 selected protein spots, corresponding to 118 unique proteins, have been identified by MALDI-TOF-MS or LC-ESI-IT-MS/MS, in which 37 protein spots representing 28 unique proteins have also been stained with Pro-Q Diamond, indicating that they are in phosphorylated forms. All the identified proteins were bioinformatically annotated in detail according to their physiochemical characteristics, subcellular location, and function. Most of the separated or identified protein spots are distributed in the area of mass 10-70 kDa and pI 5.0-8.0. The identified proteins include mainly cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins and some mitochondrial, endoplasmic reticulum, and membrane proteins. These proteins are classified into different functional groups such as structure and mobility proteins (21.2%), metabolic enzymes (16.9%), protein folding and metabolism proteins (13.6%), signaling proteins (14.4%), heat-shock proteins (7.6%), and other functional proteins (12.7%). While structure and mobility proteins are mostly represented by protein spots with high abundance, signaling proteins are mostly represented by protein spots with relatively low abundance. Such a 2-DE database for RMC, especially with many signaling proteins and phosphoproteins characterized, will provide a valuable resource for comparative proteomics analysis of normal and pathologic conditions affecting MC function or pathologic progress.",

Here, we described a strategy combining isoelectric focusing in immobilized pH gradient strips, and mass spectrometry to create a new high-throughput and sensitive detection method. Protein mixture is separated by in-gel IEF, then the entire strip is cut into a set of gel sections. Proteins in each gel section are digested with trypsin, and the resulted peptides are subjected to reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography followed by electrospray-linear ion-trap tandem mass analysis. Using this optimized strategy, we have identified 744 distinct human proteins from an IPG strip loaded only 300 microg of plasma proteins. When compared with other works in published literatures, this study offered a more convenient and sensitive method from gel to mass spectrometry for the separation and identification proteins of complex biological samples.",

        "abstract": "To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer metastasis and search for potential markers for metastatic progression, we have developed a highly metastatic variant of human MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cell line through in vivo stepwise selection of pulmonary metastatic cells caused by parental MDA-MB-435 cells in the athymic mice. Comparative proteomic analysis using 2-DE and LC-IT-MS revealed that 102 protein spots were reproducibly altered more than three-fold between the selected variant and its parental counterpart. Eleven differentially expressed protein spots were identified with high confidence using SEQUEST with uninterpreted tandem mass raw data. Cathepsin D precursor, peroxiredoxin 6 (PDX6), heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), HSP60, tropomyosin 1 (TPM1), TPM2, TPM3, TPM4, 14-3-3 protein epsilon, and tumor protein D54 were up-regulated in the highly metastatic variant, whereas alpha B-crystalline (CRAB) was only detected in its parental counterpart. Differential expression was confirmed for four proteins including PDX6, CRAB, TPM4, and HSP60 by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting analysis in our model. Immunohistochemical analysis in 80 breast cancer donors demonstrated a significant association of TPM4 (p = 0.002), HSP60 (p = 0.001), PDX6 (p = 0.002) but not CRAB (p = 0.113) staining with the presence of lymph node metastasis. In addition, TPM4 staining was also associated with clinical stage (p = 0.000), but no significant association was found between TPM4, PDX6, CRAB, and HSP60 expression and tumor size, hormone receptor, and HER-2 status (p > 0.05). The functional implication of these identified proteins was also discussed. These proteomic data are valuable and informative for understanding breast cancer metastasis and searching for potential markers for metastatic progression.",

        "abstract": "A resurgence of interest in the human plasma proteome has occurred in recent years because it holds great promise of revolution in disease diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring. As one of the most powerful separation techniques, multidimensional liquid chromatography has attracted extensive attention, but most published works have focused on the fractionation of tryptic peptides. In this study, proteins from human plasma were prefractionated by online sequential strong cation exchange chromatography and reversed-phase chromatography. The resulting 30 samples were individually digested by trypsin, and analyzed by capillary reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with linear ion trap mass spectrometry. After meeting stringent criteria, a total of 1292 distinct proteins were successfully identified in our work, among which, some proteins known to be present in serum in <10 ng/mL were detected. Compared with other works in published literatures, this analysis offered a more full-scale list of the plasma proteome. Considering our strategy allows high throughput of protein identification in serum, the prefractionation of proteins before MS analysis is a simple and effective method to facilitate human plasma proteome research.",

Proteomes of ten pairs of clinical hepatitis B virus associated HCC tissue samples were obtained by high resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Comprehensive analyses of proteins associated with B-type HCC were focused on total differentially expressed proteins (> or = two-fold increase or decrease, Student's t-test, p < 0.05) from one pair of samples. Protein identification was done by peptide mass fingerprinting with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Comparative analyses of proteins associated with B-type HCC included repeat statistics in ten cases. A total of 100 protein spots, corresponding to 80 different gene products, were identified. Proteins whose expression levels were different by more than 2-fold in at least 50% of the cases (five of ten cases) were further analyzed and 45 proteins were selected out as candidates for HCC-associated proteins. Western blotting further validated up-regulated expressions of two candidate proteins in tumor tissues: proliferating cell antigen and stathmin 1. This comprehensive and comparative analyses of proteins associated with B-type HCC could provide useful molecular markers for diagnostics and prognostics and for therapeutic targets. The physiological significance of the differential expressions for several candidate proteins are discussed.",

        "abstract": "The characterization of high-mannose-type N-glycosylation by capillary electrophoresis-electrospray mass spectrom- etry (CE-ESI MS) was described. In addition to the use of a cationic noncovalent capillary coating, strong acidic buffer, and charge reversal to increase the glycoform resolving power, N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) combined with a basic protease and r-mannosidase combined with an acidic protease were used to analyze the high-mannose- type N-glycosylation in ribonuclease B (RNase B) and in a novel C-type lectin from the venom of Trimeresurus stejnegeri (TSL). The structures of oligosaccharide, gly- cosylation sites, and glycoform distributions were deter- mined simultaneously, and the differential oxidation of Met residues in glycopeptides obtained from TSL protease digestion was also characterized successfully by CE-MS/ MS. The results showed that the oligosaccharide attached to RNase B has a structure of GlcNAc 2Man59, and that attached to TSL has a structure of GlcNAc2Man58. The glycoform distributions in these glycoproteins are quite different, with the GlcNAc 2Man5 type predominant in RNase B, and the GlcNAc2Man8 type, in TSL. This method may be useful not only for the characterization of glyco- sylation sites and glycan structures, but also for the determination of the relative abundance of individual glycoforms. Glycosylation has long been recognized as one of the most important posttranslational events affecting the functions of proteins in health and disease. The intracellular or intercellular events can be regulated by modifying the glycoform distribution of glycoproteins.1 Differential glycosylation is a major source of protein microheterogeneity.2 However, studies on the structure of glycans are much retarded in comparison with proteins and DNAs. Full structural characterization of glycans requires the defining of branching, linkages, and configurations and the identification of sugar isomers. Furthermore, oligosaccharides can be linked to Ser or Thr residues (O-glycosylation) or to Asn residues (N-glycosylation), and glycoprotein can have different oligosaccharides attached to any given possible sites, so the analysis of glycoprotein is even more difficult. Fortunately, N-glycosylation normally occurs at the Asn residue in a tripeptide recognition signal Asn-X-Ser/Thr (where X is any amino acid residue except Pro or Asp).",

The method uses an integrated column, containing both strong cation exchange and reversed-phase sections for two-dimensional liquid chromatography. The peptide mixture was fractionated by a pH step using a series of pH buffers, followed by reversed-phase chromatography. Since no salt was used during separation, the integrated multidimensional liquid chromatography can be directly connected to mass spectrometry for peptide analysis. The pH buffers were injected from an autosampler, and the entire process can be carried out on a one-dimensional liquid chromatography system. In a single analysis, the IMDL system, coupled with linear ion trap mass spectrometry, identified more than 2000 proteins in mouse liver. The peptides were eluted according to their pI distribution. The resolution of the pH fractionation is approximately 0.5 pH unit. The method has low overlapping across pH fractions, good resolution of peptide mixture, and good correlation of peptide pIs with pH steps. This method provides a technique for large-scale protein identification using existing one-dimensional HPLC systems.",

        "abstract": "The conventional 2-D LC-MS/MS setup for global proteome analysis was based on online and offline salt gradients (step and continuous) using strong-cation-exchange chromatography in conjunction with RP chromatography and MS. The use of the online system with step salt elution had the possibility of resulting in peptide overlapping across fractions. The offline mode had the option to operate with continuous salt gradient to decrease peak overlap, but exhibited decreased robustness, lower reproducibility, and sample loss during the process. Due to the extensive washing requirement between the chromatography steps, online continuous gradient was not an option for salt elution. In this report, a fully automated, online, and continuous gradient (pH continuous online gradient, pCOG) 2-D LC-MS/MS system is introduced that provided excellent separation and identification power. The pH gradient-based elution provided more basic peptides than that of salt-based elution. Fraction overlap was significantly minimized by combining pH and continuous gradient elutions. This latter approach also increased sequence coverage and the concomitant confidence level in protein identification. The salt and pH elution-based 2-D LC-MS/MS approaches were compared by analyzing the mouse liver proteome.",

        "abstract": "We have investigated the serum proteome of Han-nationality Chinese by using shotgun strategy. A complete proteomics analysis was performed on two reference specimens from a total of 20 healthy donors, in which each sample was made from ten-pooled male or female serum, respectively. The methodology used encompassed (1) removal of six high-abundant proteins; (2) tryptic digestion of low- and high-abundant proteins of serum; (3) separation of peptide mixture by RP-HPLC followed by ESI-MS/MS identification. A total of 944 nonredundant proteins were identified under a stringent filter condition (X(corr) > or = 1.9, > or = 2.2, and > or = 3.75, < or = C(n) > or = 0.1, and R(sp) > or = 4.0) in both pooled male and female samples, in which 594 and 622 entire proteins were found, respectively. Compared with the total 3020 protein identifications confirmed by more than one laboratory or more than one specimen in HUPO Plasma Proteome Project (PPP) participating laboratories recently, 206 proteins were identified with at least two distinct peptides per protein and 185 proteins were considered as high-confidence identification. Moreover, some lower abundance serum proteins (ng/mL range) were detected, such as complement C5 and CA125, routinely used as an ovarian cancer marker in plasma and serum. The resulting nonredundant list of serum proteins would add significant information to the knowledge base of human plasma proteome and facilitate disease markers discovery.",

To analyze total 1377 high-confident serum-proteins, we developed a computing strategy called localized statistics of protein abundance distribution (LSPAD) to calculate a significant bias of a particular protein-abundance between these two cohorts. As a result, 68 proteins were found significantly over-represented in the diabetic serum (p<0.01). In addition, a pathway-associated analysis was developed to obtain the overall pathway bias associated with type 2 diabetes, from which the significant over-representation of complement system associated with type 2 diabetes was uncovered. Moreover, an up-stream activator of complement pathway, ficolin-3, was observed over-represented in the serum of type 2 diabetic patients, which was further validated with statistic significance (p = 0.012) with more clinical samples.The developed LSPAD approach is well fit for analyzing proteomic data derived from biological complex systems such as plasma proteome. With LSPAD, we disclosed the comprehensive distribution of the proteins associated with diabetes in different abundance levels and the involvement of ficolin-related complement activation in diabetes.",

They are believed to play roles in the viral life cycle and may contribute to the pathogenesis and virulence. ORF9b as one of these accessory proteins is located in subgenomic mRNA9 and encodes a 98 amino acid protein. However, whether 9b protein is a structural component of SARS-CoV particles remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that 9b protein is translated from bicistronic mRNA9 via leaky ribosome scanning and it is incorporated into both virus-like particles (VLPs) and purified SARS-CoV virions. Further analysis shows that sufficient incorporation of 9b protein into VLPs is dependent upon the co-expression of E and M proteins, but not upon the presence of either S or N protein. Our data indicate that 9b protein of SARS-CoV is another virion-associated accessory protein. This finding will lead to a better understanding of the properties of the SARS-CoV 9b protein.",

        "abstract": "For large-scale analysis of phosphorylation at proteome-wide scale, a variety of affinity-based strategies have been developed to enrich phosphopeptide. Because each method differed in their specificity of isolation, the global and unbiased enrichment of phosphopeptides remains a major technical challenge in phosphoproteomics. In the present work, we demostrate that the phosphopeptide enrichment method based on an online continuous pH gradient in a strong anion exchange column (SAX method) is highly complementary to the method based on titanium dioxide (TiO2) affinity enrichment. Moreover, we found that the flow-through fraction of either SAX or SCX is very phosphopeptide-rich, which necessitates further analysis by complementary method. Here, we developed a comprehensive phosphopeptides profiling strategy based on anion exchange followed by flow-through enrichment by TiO2 (AFET). In this strategy, SAX method was used as the first separation/enrichment step, which was online coupled with LC-MS/MS. The phosphopeptides in the SAX flow-through fraction were further enriched with TiO2. As a result, a more comprehensive, less biased phosphoproteome was aquired. Careful comparison of four different combination strategies reveal that the AFET method showed the advantages of more identified phosphopeptides, less mass spectrometry analysis time, as well as simple and automatic process step. It is well-suited for robust and reproducible phosphoproteomics, especially in the case of small amounts of sample.",

This work developed a chromatographic method called virtual three-dimensional chromatography to fractionate complex protein mixtures. By alternate elution with different pHs and salt concentrations, we implemented pH and salt steps by turns on a single strong cation exchange column to fully exploit its chromatographic ability. Given standard proteins that were not resolved solely by pH or salt gradient elution could be successfully separated using this combined mode. With a reversed phase column tandem connected behind, we further fractionated as well as desalted proteins as the third dimension. This present strategy could readily be adapted with respect to special complexity of biological samples. Crude plasma without depleting high abundance proteins were fractionated by this three-dimensional mode and then analyzed by reversed phase liquid chromatography coupled with LTQ mass spectrometry. In total, 1933 protein groups with wide dynamic ranges were identified from a single experiment. Some characteristics that correlated to the behavior of proteins on strong cation exchange columns are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "Most current technologies for the enrichment of phosphopeptides rely on a tandem combination of different chromatography modes. Here, a fully automatic two-dimensional liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method was developed for global phosphopeptide identification. The peptide mixtures were loaded on a strong anion exchange (SAX) column under basic pH conditions and eluted with a continuous gradient to pH 2.0. This SAX system could be coupled online with reversed-phase liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (RP-LC-MS/MS). For peptide digests from a standard protein mixture spiked with synthesized phosphopeptides, most of the nonphosphorylated peptides were eluted in more basic pH than phosphopeptides, and the phosphopeptides were focused to acidic pH ranges and gradually eluted according to the phosphorylated states of peptides. Compared with the pH step elution method, the continuous gradient method displayed better repeatability and less peptide cross-overlap between fractions. This system provided a robust and fully automatic approach to large-scale phosphoproteomic profiling. For protein tryptic digests from HeLa cells, 1833 nonredundant phosphorylation sites were identified based on this two-phase separation. Compared with the method combining cation exchange and titanium dioxide, this anion-exchange based system preferred to identify more acidic and multiphosphorylated peptides. It also covered a more complete series of phosphorylation states of peptides.",

        "abstract": "A system which consisted of multidimensional liquid chromatography (Yin-yang MDLC) coupled with mass spectrometry was used for the identification of peptides and phosphopeptides. The multidimensional liquid chromatography combines the strong-cation exchange (SCX), strong-anion exchange (SAX), and reverse-phase methods for the separation. Protein digests were first loaded on an SCX column. The flow-through peptides from SCX were collected and further loaded on an SAX column. Both columns were eluted by offline pH steps, and the collected fractions were identified by reverse-phase liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Comprehensive peptide identification was achieved by the Yin-yang MDLC-MS/MS for a 1 mg mouse liver. In total, 14 105 unique peptides were identified with high confidence, including 13 256 unmodified peptides and 849 phosphopeptides with 809 phosphorylated sites. The SCX and SAX in the Yin-Yang system displayed complementary features of binding and separation for peptides. When coupled with reverse-phase liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, the SAX-based method can detect more extremely acidic (pI < 4.0) and phosphorylated peptides, while the SCX-based method detects more relatively basic peptides (pI > 4.0). In total, 134 groups of phosphorylated peptide isoforms were obtained, with common peptide sequences but different phosphorylated states. This unbiased profiling of protein expression and phosphorylation provides a powerful approach to probe protein dynamics, without using any prefractionation and chemical derivation.",

        "abstract": "Increasing attention has been paid to the urinary proteome because it holds the promise of discovering various disease biomarkers. However, most of the urine proteomics studies routinely relied on protein pre-fractionation and so far did not present characterization on phosphorylation status. Two robust approaches, integrated multidimensional liquid chromatography (IMDL) and Yin-yang multidimensional liquid chromatography (MDLC) tandem mass spectrometry, were recently developed in our laboratory, with high-coverage identification of peptide mixtures. In this study, we adopted a strategy without pre-fractionation on the protein level for urinary proteome identification, using both the IMDL and the Yin-yang MDLC methods for peptide fractionation followed by identification using a linear ion trap-orbitrap (LTQ-Orbitrap) mass spectrometer with high resolution and mass accuracy. A total of 1310 non-redundant proteins were highly confidently identified from two experiments, significantly including 59 phosphorylation sites. More than half the annotated identifications were membrane-related proteins. In addition, the lysosomal as well as kidney-associated proteins were detected. Compared with the six largest datasets of urinary proteins published previously, we found our data included most of the reported proteins. Our study developed a robust approach for exploring the human urinary proteome, which would provide a catalogue of urine proteins on a global scale. It is the first report, to our best knowledge, to profile the urinary phosphoproteome. This work significantly extends current comprehension of urinary protein modification and its potential biological significance. Moreover, the strategy could further serve as a reference for biomarker discovery.",

        "abstract": "The complexity of canonical Wnt signaling comes not only from the numerous components but also from multiple post-translational modifications. Protein phosphorylation is one of the most common modifications that propagates signals from extracellular stimuli to downstream effectors. To investigate the global phosphorylation regulation and uncover novel phosphoproteins at the early stages of canonical Wnt signaling, HEK293 cells were metabolically labeled with two stable isotopic forms of lysine and were stimulated for 0, 1, or 30 min with purified Wnt3a. After phosphoprotein enrichment and LC-MS/MS analysis, 1057 proteins were identified in all three time points. In total 287 proteins showed a 1.5-fold or greater change in at least one time point. In addition to many known Wnt signaling transducers, other phosphoproteins were identified and quantitated, implicating their involvement in canonical Wnt signaling. k-Means clustering analysis showed dynamic patterns for the differential phosphoproteins. Profile pattern and interaction network analysis of the differential phosphoproteins implicated the possible roles for those unreported components in Wnt signaling. Moreover 100 unique phosphorylation sites were identified, and 54 of them were quantitated in the three time points. Site-specific phosphopeptide quantitation revealed that Ser-20 phosphorylation on RRM2 increased upon 30-min Wnt3a stimulation. Further studies with mutagenesis, the Wnt reporter gene assay, and RNA interference indicated that RRM2 functioned downstream of beta-catenin as an inhibitor of Wnt signaling and that Ser-20 phosphorylation of RRM2 counteracted its inhibition effect. Our systematic profiling of dynamic phosphorylation changes responding to Wnt3a stimulation not only presented a comprehensive phosphorylation network regulated by canonical Wnt signaling but also found novel molecules and phosphorylation involved in Wnt signaling.",

This paper provides an approach to utilizing the cor- relative information among features to compute the similarity of cases for case retrieval. This is achieved by extending the dot product-based linear similarity measures to their nonlinear versions with kernel functions. An application to the peptide retrieval problem in bioinformatics shows the effectiveness of the ap- proach. In this problem, the objective is to retrieve the corresponding peptide to the input tandem mass spectrum from a large database of known peptides. By a kernel function implicitly mapping the tandem mass spectrum to a high dimen- sional space, the correlative information among fragment ions in a tandem mass spectrum can be modeled to dramatically reduce the stochastic mismatches. The experiment on the real spectra dataset shows a significant reduction of 10% in the error rate as compared to a common linear similarity function.",

        "abstract": "We present a new preprocessing method, PeakSelect, to improve the accuracy and efficiency of Tandem Mass-Spec peptide (protein) identification. The fundamental difference between noise and fragment ions in spectra is that ions have isotopes but noise does not. We propose a new and important concept of an Isotope Pattern Vector (IPV) which characterizes the isotope cluster of fragment ions. Then the noise and real peaks can be distinguished by the quantitative IPV values. PeakSelect first uses a new method of the Gaussian Mixture Model and Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to find the base intensity level (baseline) in a spectrum. Then PeakSelect selects features based on the IPV and baseline, and constructs a decision tree to automatically classify the peaks into different categories such as noise, single ion peaks, and overlapping peaks. Experiments show that PeakSelect can help to reduce the Mascot searching time and increase the reliability of peptide identifications. In particular, PeakSelect performs well on complex spectra with a large number of peaks from large peptides, and supports more sequence identification than other well-known systems.",

        "abstract": "A number of different approaches have been proposed to predict elemental component formulas (or molecular formulas) of molecular ions in low and medium resolution mass spectra. Most of them rely on isotope patterns, enumerate all possible formulas for an ion, and exclude certain formulas violating chemical constraints. However, these methods cannot be well generalized to the component prediction of fragment ions in tandem mass spectra. In this paper, a new method, FFP (Fragment ion Formula Prediction), is presented to predict elemental component formulas of fragment ions. In the FFP method, the prediction of the best formulas is converted into the minimization of the distance between theoretical and observed isotope patterns. And, then, a novel local search model is proposed to generate a set of candidate formulas efficiently. After the search, FFP applies a new multiconstraint filtering to exclude as many invalid and improbable formulas as possible. FFP is experimentally compared with the previous enumeration methods, and shown to outperform them significantly. The results of this paper can help to improve the reliability of de novo in the identification of peptide sequences.",

        "abstract": "Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has become increasingly important and indispensable in high-throughput proteomics for identifying complex protein mixtures. Database searching is the standard method to accomplish this purpose. A key sub-routine, peptide identification, is used to generate a list of candidate peptides from a protein database according to an experimental MS/MS spectrum, and then validate these candidate peptides for protein identification. Although currently there are many algorithms for peptide identification, most of them either lack an effective validation module or only validate the first-ranked peptide, thus leading to a low identification reliability or sensitivity. This paper proposes a new algorithm, named pepReap, to overcome the above drawbacks. It consists of a two-layered scoring scheme based on machine learning. The first layer is a rough scoring function which uses some simple and heuristic factors to measure the degree of the matches between an experimental MS/MS spectrum and the candidate peptides; thus a ranked list of candidate peptides is generated at a relatively low computational cost. The second layer is a fine scoring function which re-ranks the candidate peptides generated in the first layer and determines which one among them is the true positive. The fine scoring function was designed based on support vector machines (SVMs) using more comprehensive factors, such as the correlations between ions, the mass matching errors of fragment and peptide ions, etc. Consequently, the SVM classifier serves as not only a scorer but also a validation module. Experimental comparison with the popular SEQUEST algorithm coupled with threshold validation criteria on a reported dataset demonstrates that the pepReap algorithm achieves higher performance in terms of identification sensitivity with comparable precision.",

Previous mass error models are the simplistic uniform or normal distribution with empirically set parameter values. In this paper, we propose a more accurate mass error model, namely conditional normal model, and an iterative parameter learning algorithm. The new model is based on two important observations on the mass error distribution, i.e. the linearity between the mean of mass error and the ion mass, and the log-log linearity between the standard deviation of mass error and the peak intensity. To our knowledge, the latter quantitative relationship has never been reported before. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately quantifying the mass error distribution and the ability of the new model to improve the accuracy of peptide identification.",

Until now, an efficient scoring algorithm that considers the correlative information in a tunable and comprehensive manner has been lacking.This paper provides a promising approach to utilizing the correlative information for improving the peptide identification accuracy. The kernel trick, rooted in the statistical learning theory, is exploited to address this issue with low computational effort. The common scoring method, the tandem mass spectral dot product (SDP), is extended to the kernel SDP (KSDP). Experiments on a dataset reported previously demonstrate the effectiveness of the KSDP. The implementation on consecutive fragments shows a decrease of 10% in the error rate compared with the SDP. Our software tool, pFind, using a simple scoring function based on the KSDP, outperforms two SDP-based software tools, SEQUEST and Sonar MS/MS, in terms of identification accuracy.http://www.jdl.ac.cn/user/yfu/pfind/index.html",

Based on this design, pFind 2.0 provides an automated target-decoy database search strategy: The user can just specify a certain false positive rate (FPR) and start searching. Then the system will return the protein identification results automatically filtered by such an estimated FPR. Secondly, pFind 2.0 is also of high accuracy and high speed. Many pragmatic preprocessing, peptide-scoring, validation, and protein inference algorithms have been incorporated. To speed up the searching process, a toolbox for indexing protein databases is developed for high-throughput applications and all modules are implemented under a new architecture designed for large-scale parallel and distributed searching. An experiment on a public dataset shows that pFind 2.0 can identify more peptides than SEQUEST and Mascot at the 1% FPR. It is also demonstrated that this version of pFind 2.0 has better usability and higher speed than its previous versions.

        "abstract": "Membranous nephropathy is an important glomerular disease characterized by podocyte injury and proteinuria, but no metabolomics research was reported as yet. Here, we performed a parallel metabolomics study, based on human urine and serum, to comprehensively profile systematic metabolic variations, identify differential metabolites, and understand the pathogenic mechanism of membranous nephropathy.There were obvious metabolic distinctions between the membranous nephropathy patients with urine protein lower than 3.5 g/24 h (LUPM) and those higher than 3.5 g/24 h (HUPM) by Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) model analysis. In total, 26 urine metabolites and 9 serum metabolites were identified to account for such differences, and the majority of metabolites were significantly increased in HUPM patients for both urines and serums. Combining the results of urine with serum, all differential metabolites were classified to 5 classes. This classification helps globally probe the systematic metabolic alterations before and after blood flowing through kidney. Citric acid and 4 amino acids were markedly increased only in the serum samples of HUPM patients, implying more impaired filtration function of kidneys of HUPM patients than LUPM patients. The dicarboxylic acids, phenolic acids, and cholesterol were significantly elevated only in urines of HUPM patients, suggesting more severe oxidative attacks than LUPM patients.Parallel metabolomics of urine and serum revealed the systematic metabolic variations associated with LUPM and HUPM patients, where HUPM patients suffered more severe injury of kidney function and oxidative stresses than LUPM patients. This research exhibited a promising application of parallel metabolomics in renal diseases.",

        "abstract": "Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN1-4) play a crucial role in the regulation of cell excitability. Importantly, they contribute to spontaneous rhythmic activity in brain and heart. HCN channels are principally activated by membrane hyperpolarization and binding of cAMP. Here, we identify tyrosine phosphorylation by Src kinase as another mechanism affecting channel gating. Inhibition of Src by specific blockers slowed down activation kinetics of native and heterologously expressed HCN channels. The same effect on HCN channel activation was observed in cells cotransfected with a dominant-negative Src mutant. Immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Src binds to and phosphorylates native and heterologously expressed HCN2. Src interacts via its SH3 domain with a sequence of HCN2 encompassing part of the C-linker and the cyclic nucleotide binding domain. We identified a highly conserved tyrosine residue in the C-linker of HCN channels (Tyr476 in HCN2) that confers modulation by Src. Replacement of this tyrosine by phenylalanine in HCN2 or HCN4 abolished sensitivity to Src inhibitors. Mass spectrometry confirmed that Tyr476 is phosphorylated by Src. Our results have functional implications for HCN channel gating. Furthermore, they indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation contributes in vivo to the fine tuning of HCN channel activity.",

We sought the association between urinary PEDF (uPEDF) and development of nephropathy among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).Two human studies were performed in which uPEDF was determined by ELISA. These studies included (1) a cross-sectional study of T2DM (n = 228) and healthy controls (n = 46) [corrected] and (2) a longitudinal study of hypertensive T2DM with microalbuminuria (MA; n = 42) treated with irbesartan for 6 months. An animal study was performed in which PEDF was measured in the kidney and urine samples of control rats, rats rendered diabetic with streptozotocin that were also fed a high-fat diet, and diabetic rats treated with irbesartan for 3 months.Cross-sectional study: compared to controls, uPEDF was significantly higher in patients with diabetic nephropathy. uPEDF independently correlated with MA. In the MA group, uPEDF in patients with diabetic retinopathy was significantly higher than that in patients without diabetic retinopathy. Longitudinal study: irbesartan significantly decreased uPEDF in T2DM with MA. Animal study: in diabetic rats, increased PEDF was observed in both the urine and kidney samples. uPEDF showed a significant correlation with the expression of PEDF in the kidney. Irbesartan could significantly decrease the PEDF expression in the kidneys of diabetic rats as well as uPEDF.uPEDF may serve as a novel marker for screening for nephropathy among patients with T2DM and monitoring the response to therapy.",

        "abstract": "The binding of insulin to its receptor triggers a signaling cascade regulated by protein complexes via tyrosine phosphorylation events on a multitude of associated proteins. To search novel phosphotyrosine proteins or associated proteins involved in insulin signaling pathway, we employed a method in which Rat1 cells stably expressing the human insulin receptor were stimulated with or without insulin and sub-fractionated prior to enrichment of phosphotyrosine proteins by immunoprecipitation and analysis by LC-MS/MS. Bioinformatic analysis and manual confirmation of peptide phosphorylation site assignments led to identification of 35 phosphotyrosine sites derived from 31 protein groups. Over 50% of these proteins were reported for the first time as tyrosine phosphorylated, including gigaxonin, XIAP and CDK10. In addition, we also found that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein serine kinase (CASK), a key protein in protein-targeting and vesicle transport in neurons, forms a complex with two unidentified phosphotyrosine proteins pp100 and pp95 in response to insulin-stimulation, though CASK is not itself tyrosine phosphorylated. Furthermore, insulin was able to decrease CASK nuclear location, as well as down-regulate the expression of CASK targeted genes. Our results imply CASK as a novel joint knot connecting CASK-mediated pathways with the insulin signaling. Our data provide a wealth of information potentially paving the way to identify new components in the insulin signaling network.",

        "abstract": "Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounds most vessels and shares common features with brown adipose tissue (BAT). Although adaptive thermogenesis in BAT increases energy expenditure and is beneficial for metabolic diseases, little is known about the role of PVAT in vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. We hypothesize that the thermogenic function of PVAT regulates intravascular temperature and reduces atherosclerosis.PVAT shares similar structural and proteomics with BAT. We demonstrated that PVAT has thermogenic properties similar to BAT in response to cold stimuli in vivo. Proteomics analysis of the PVAT from mice housed in a cold environment identified differential expression in proteins highly related to cellular metabolic processes. In a mouse model deficient in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 in smooth muscle cells (SMPG KO mice), we uncovered a complete absence of PVAT surrounding the vasculature, likely caused by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 deletion in the perivascular adipocyte precursor cells as well. Lack of PVAT, which results in loss of its thermogenic activity, impaired vascular homeostasis, which caused temperature loss and endothelial dysfunction. We further showed that cold exposure inhibits atherosclerosis and improves endothelial function in mice with intact PVAT but not in SMPG KO mice as a result of impaired lipid clearance. Proinflammatory cytokine expression in PVAT is not altered on exposure to cold. Finally, prostacyclin released from PVAT contributes to the vascular protection against endothelial dysfunction.PVAT is a vasoactive organ with functional characteristics similar to BAT and is essential for intravascular thermoregulation of cold acclimation. This thermogenic capacity of PVAT plays an important protective role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.",

        "abstract": "Valid animal models are useful for studying the pathophysiology of specific disorders, such as neural disease, diabetes and cancer. Previous molecular phylogeny studies indicate that the tree shrew is in the same order as (or a close sister to) primates, and thus may be an ideal model in which to study human disease. In this study, the proteome of liver and muscle tissue in tree the shrew was identified by combining peptide fractionation and LC-MS/MS identification. In total, 2146 proteins were detected, including 1759 proteins in liver samples and 885 proteins in skeletal muscle samples from the tree shrew. Further sub-source analysis revealed that nearly half of the identified proteins (846 proteins and 418 proteins) were derived from human database. In this study, we are the first to describe the characteristics of the proteome from the liver and skeletal muscle of the tree shrew. Phylogenetic tree analysis based on these proteomic data showed that the tree shrew is closer to primates (human) than to glires (the mouse and rat).",

This library represents a large collection of genes regulating cell cycle, cell size, and proliferation and will be a valuable resource for studying growth regulation in vivo. By using misexpression of genes, we prevent problems arising from genetic redundancy and can uncover novel gene functions. To validate the usefulness of this library, we screened for Wingless (Wg) pathway components. We used a combination of experimental and bioinformatic approaches to predict candidates and identified three serine/threonine kinases as regulators of Wg signaling. We show that one of these, Nek2, optimizes pathway response by direct phosphorylation of Dishevelled. In addition, we describe functional relations for roughly 5% of all Drosophila genes and identify a large number of genes that regulate cell size, proliferation, and final organ size upon misexpression.",

We have previously identified a novel variant rs12742393 of NOS1AP for type 2 diabetes susceptibility in the Chinese population. In this study, we analyzed the total serum profiling among three genotypes of rs12742393 to discover potential crosstalk under the variant and the disease through proteomic analyses for the first time. We used OFFGEL peptide fractionation, LC-MS/MS analysis, and label-free quantification to profile the fasting human serum samples of the genotypes in rs12742393 (n = 4, for CC, AC, and AA, resp.). Four proteins were identified, including apoA4, alpha1-ACT, HABP2, and keratin 10, with blood levels changed significantly between CC and AA homozygotes of rs12742393. Compared with AA group, the levels of apoA4 increased (P = 0.000265), whereas the concentration of alpha1-ACT, HABP2, and keratin 10 decreased in CC group (P = 0.011116, 0.021175, and 0.015661, resp.). Then we selected additional fasting serum samples for ELISA and western blot validation. However, no significant differences were identified by neither ELISA nor western blot (P > 0.05). The protein profiling changes between the genotypes of rs12742393 indicated that this SNP might play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Body fluid proteome is the most informative proteome from a medical viewpoint. But the lack of accurate quantitation method for complicated body fluid limited its application in disease research and biomarker discovery. To address this problem, we introduced a novel strategy, in which SILAC-labeled mouse serum was used as internal standard for human serum and urine proteome analysis. The SILAC-labeled mouse serum was mixed with human serum and urine, and multidimensional separation coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (IEF-LC-MS/MS) analysis was performed. The shared peptides between two species were quantified by their SILAC pairs, and the human-only peptides were quantified by mouse peptides with coelution. The comparison for the results from two replicate experiments indicated the high repeatability of our strategy. Then the urine from Immunoglobulin A nephropathy patients treated and untreated was compared by this quantitation strategy. Fifty-three peptides were found to be significantly changed between two groups, including both known diagnostic markers for IgAN and novel candidates, such as Complement C3, Albumin, VDBP, ApoA,1 and IGFBP7. In conclusion, we have developed a practical and accurate quantitation strategy for comparison of complicated human body fluid proteome. The results from such strategy could provide potential disease-related biomarkers for evaluation of treatment.",

        "abstract": "Large efforts have been taken to search for genes responsible for type 2 diabetes (T2D), but have resulted in only about 20 in humans due to its complexity and heterogeneity. The GK rat, a spontanous T2D model, offers us a superior opportunity to search for more diabetic genes. Utilizing array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) technology, we identifed 137 non-redundant copy number variation (CNV) regions from the GK rats when using normal Wistar rats as control. These CNV regions (CNVRs) covered approximately 36 Mb nucleotides, accounting for about 1% of the whole genome. By integrating information from gene annotations and disease knowledge, we investigated the CNVRs comprehensively for mining new T2D genes. As a result, we prioritized 16 putative protein-coding genes and two microRNA genes (rno-mir-30b and rno-mir-30d) as good candidates. The catalogue of CNVRs between GK and Wistar rats identified in this work served as a repository for mining genes that might play roles in the pathogenesis of T2D. Moreover, our efforts in utilizing bioinformatics methods to prioritize good candidate genes provided a more specific set of putative candidates. These findings would contribute to the research into the genetic basis of T2D, and thus shed light on its pathogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Background: Membranous nephropathy is an important glomerular disease characterized by podocyte injury and proteinuria, but no metabolomics research was reported as yet. Here, we performed a parallel metabolomics study, based on human urine and serum, to comprehensively profile systematic metabolic alterations, identify differential metabolites, and understand the pathogenic mechanism of membranous nephropathy. Results: There were obvious metabolic distinctions between the membranous nephropathy patients with urine protein lower than 3.5 g/24h (LUPM) and those higher than 3.5 g/24h (HUPM) by PLS-DA model analysis. In total, 26 urine metabolites and 9 serum metabolites were identified to account for such differences, and the majority of metabolites was significantly increased in HUPM patients whether for urines or for serums. Combining the results of urine with serum, all differential metabolites were classified to 5 classes. This classification helps globally insight the systematic metabolic alteration before and after blood flowing through kidney. Citric acid and 4 amino acids were markedly increased only in the serum samples of HUPM patients, implying more impaired filtration function of kidneys of HUPM patients than LUPM patients. The dicarboxylic acids, phenolic acids, and cholesterol were significantly elevated only in urines of HUPM patients, suggesting more severe oxidative attacks than LUPM patients. Conclusion: Parallel metabolomics of urine and serum revealed the systematic metabolic variations associated with LUPM and HUPM patients, where HUPM patients suffered more severe injury of kidney function and oxidative stresses than LUPM patients.

        "abstract": "Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are recognized as one kind of major genetic variants in population scale. However, polymorphisms at the proteome level in population scale remain elusive. In the present study, we named amino acid variances derived from SNPs within coding regions as single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs) at the proteome level, and developed a pipeline of non-targeted and targeted proteomics to identify and quantify SAP peptides in human plasma. The absolute concentrations of three selected SAP-peptide pairs among 290 Asian individuals were measured by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) approach, and their associations with both obesity and diabetes were further analyzed. This work revealed that heterozygotes and homozygotes with various SAPs in a population could have different associations with particular traits. In addition, the SRM approach allows us for the first time to separately measure the absolute concentration of each SAP peptide in the heterozygotes, which also shows different associations with particular traits.",

        "abstract": "Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent and capable of unlimited self-renewal. Elucidation of the underlying molecular mechanism may contribute to the advancement of cell-based regenerative medicine. In the present work, we performed a large scale analysis of the phosphoproteome in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells. Using multiplex strategies, we detected 4581 proteins and 3970 high confidence distinct phosphosites in 1642 phosphoproteins. Notably, 22 prominent phosphorylated stem cell marker proteins with 39 novel phosphosites were identified for the first time by mass spectrometry, including phosphorylation sites in NANOG (Ser-65) and RE1 silencing transcription factor (Ser-950 and Thr-953). Quantitative profiles of NANOG peptides obtained during the differentiation of mES cells revealed that the abundance of phosphopeptides and non-phosphopeptides decreased with different trends. To our knowledge, this study presents the largest global characterization of phosphorylation in mES cells. Compared with a study of ultimately differentiated tissue cells, a bioinformatics analysis of the phosphorylation data set revealed a consistent phosphorylation motif in human and mouse ES cells. Moreover, investigations into phosphorylation conservation suggested that phosphoproteins were more conserved in the undifferentiated ES cell state than in the ultimately differentiated tissue cell state. However, the opposite conclusion was drawn from this conservation comparison with phosphosites. Overall, this work provides an overview of phosphorylation in mES cells and is a valuable resource for the future understanding of basic biology in mES cells.",

Phosphorylation plays pivotal roles in islet function, especially in islet glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. A systematic view on how phosphorylation networks were coordinately regulated in this process remains lacking, partially due to the limited amount of islets from an individual for a phosphoproteomic analysis. Here we optimized the in-tip and best-ratio phosphopeptide enrichment strategy and a SILAC-based workflow for processing rat islet samples. With limited islet lysates from each individual rat (20\u201347 \u03bcg), we identified 8539 phosphosites on 2487 proteins. Subsequent quantitative analyses uncovered that short-term (30 min) high glucose stimulation induced coordinate responses of islet phosphoproteome on multiple biological levels, including insulin secretion related pathways, cytoskeleton dynamics, protein processing in ER and Golgi, transcription and translation, and so on.

A mixture of peptides Met-enkephalin and Leu-enkephalin was analyzed, and their amino acid sequences were identified, respectively, using CZE/MS/MS. Peptide mapping for a tryptic digest of horse cytochrome c was performed by the same method. The results indicated that almost all peptides generated by tryptic digestion were identified, and their sequences were interpreted by their collision-induced (CID) mass spectra. Applying the uninterpreted CID spectra of the protein digest to searching in sequence database by the SEQUEST program could identify proteins conveniently and rapidly. The samples consumed in the CZE/MS/MS experiments were at picomole level, so this method is quite suitable for quality control of recombinant proteins and trace amount protein identification in the proteome research.",

Proteins were separated and resolved in CIEF according to their differences in isoelectric point (pI), and then characterized by ESI-MS. The focused protein zones were eluted to the entrance of MS by combining cathodic mobilization with gravity. The ultrahigh resolution (difference in pI<0.04) of this technique obtained under certain conditions led to the detection of three isoforms in hemoglobin A and in sickle cell hemoglobin (with similar charge distribution and same molecular weight, but their differences in pIranging from 0.04 to 0.08) and two isoforms of beta-lactoglobulin A (difference in pI is 0.6). The isoelectric points, relative amounts, and molecular masses of these isoforms were determined simultaneously by CIEF-ESI-MS.",

Many advances have been made recently, including online/offline mode and optimization of sample loading/elution buffer; however, beads usage has rarely been explored. In the current study, we found that the peptide-to-TiO(2) beads ratio was a significant factor for phosphopeptide enrichment, and insufficient or excessive beads could decrease the selectivity. Specifically, for HeLa total cell lysate, the optimum peptide-to-beads ratio is about 1:2-1:8 (mass/mass) to obtain the highest enrichment selectivity and the maximum phosphopeptides identification with single incubation. Pre-experiments are recommended to decide an optimum peptide-to-TiO(2) beads ratio when it comes to different samples. Interestingly, deficient beads can help identify much more multiphosphorylated peptides than the optimum peptide-to-beads ratio by consecutive incubations. Therefore, if multiphosphorylated peptides identification is desired, deficient beads amount is preferred. In addition, consecutive incubation using deficient beads could be used as a fractionation of phosphopeptides besides as an enrichment method.",

        "abstract": "Each phase of eukaryotic cell cycle is tightly controlled by multicomponent regulatory networks based on complex relationships of protein phosphorylation. In order to better understand the relationships between kinases and their substrate proteins during the progression of cell cycle, we analyzed phosphoproteome of HeLa cells during G1, S, and G2/M phases of cell cycle using our developed quantitative phosphoproteomic approaches. A total of 4776 high-confidence phosphorylation sites (phosphosites) in 1177 proteins were identified. Bioinformatics analysis for predicting kinase groups revealed that 46 kinase groups could be assigned to 4321 phosphosites. The majority of phosphoproteins harboring two or more phosphosites could be phosphorylated by different kinase groups, in which nine major kinase groups accounted for more than 90% phosphosites. Further analyses showed that approximately half of the examined two phosphosite combinations were correlatively regulated, regardless of whether the kinase groups were same or not. In general, the majority of proteins containing correlated phosphosites had solely co-regulated or counter-regulated phosphosites, and co-regulation was significantly more frequent than counter-regulation, suggesting that the former may be more important for regulating the cell cycle. In conclusion, our findings provide new insights into the complex regulatory mechanisms of protein phosphorylation networks during eukaryotic cell cycle.",

        "abstract": "The tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1/NF-\u03b1B-signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in various processes including apoptosis, cellular differentiation, host defense, inflammation, autoimmunity and organogenesis. The complexity of the TNF-\u03b1/NF-\u03b1B signaling is in part due to the dynamic protein behaviors of key players in this pathway. In this present work, a dynamic and global view of the signaling components in the nucleus at the early stages of TNF-\u03b1/NF-\u03b1B signaling was obtained in HEK293 cells, by a combination of subcellular fractionation and stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). The dynamic profile patterns of 547 TNF-\u03b1-induced nuclei-associated proteins were quantified in our studies. The functional characters of all the profiles were further analyzed using that Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation. Additionally, many previously unknown effectors of TNF-\u03b1/NF-\u03b1B signaling were identified, quantified and clustered into differential activation profiles. Interestingly, levels of Fanconi anemia group D2 protein (FANCD2), one of the Fanconi anemia family proteins, was found to be increased in the nucleus by SILAC quantitation upon TNF\u03b1 stimulation, which was further verified by western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. This indicates that FANCD2 might be involved in TNF-\u03b1/NF-\u03b1B signaling through its accumulation in the nucleus. In summary, the combination of subcellular proteomics with quantitative analysis not only allowed for a dissection of the nuclear TNF\u03b1/NF-\u03b1B-signaling pathway, but also provided a systematic strategy for monitoring temporal and spatial changes in cell signaling. \u00a9 2009 IBCB, SIBS, CAS All rights reserved.",

        "title": "A comparative proteomic strategy for subcellular proteome research",
        "abstract": "Subcellular proteomics, as an important step to functional proteomics, has been a focus in proteomic research. However, the co-purification of \"contaminating\" proteins has been the major problem in all the subcellular proteomic research including all kinds of mitochondrial proteome research. It is often difficult to conclude whether these \"contaminants\" represent true endogenous partners or artificial associations induced by cell disruption or incomplete purification. To solve such a problem, we applied a high-throughput comparative proteome experimental strategy, ICAT approach performed with two-dimensional LC-MS/MS analysis, coupled with combinational usage of different bioinformatics tools, to study the proteome of rat liver mitochondria prepared with traditional centrifugation (CM) or further purified with a Nycodenz gradient (PM). A total of 169 proteins were identified and quantified convincingly in the ICAT analysis, in which 90 proteins have an ICAT ratio of PM:CM > 1.0, while another 79 proteins have an ICAT ratio of PM:CM < 1.0. Almost all the proteins annotated as mitochondrial according to Swiss-Prot annotation, bioinformatics prediction, and literature reports have a ratio of PM:CM > 11.0, while proteins annotated as extracellular or secreted, cytoplasmic, endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomal, and so on have a ratio of PM:CM < 1.0. Catalase and AP endonuclease 1, which have been known as peroxisomal and nuclear, respectively, have shown a ratio of PM:CM > 1.0, confirming the reports about their mitochondrial location. Moreover, the 125 proteins with subcellular location annotation have been used as a testing dataset to evaluate the efficiency for ascertaining mitochondrial proteins by ICAT analysis and the bioinformatics tools such as PSORT, TargetP, SubLoc, MitoProt, and Predotar. The results indicated that ICAT analysis coupled with combinational usage of different bioinformatics tools could effectively ascertain mitochondrial proteins and distinguish contaminant proteins and even multilocation proteins. Using such a strategy, many novel proteins, known proteins without subcellular location annotation, and even known proteins that have been annotated as other locations have been strongly indicated for their mitochondrial location. \u00a9 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid expansion of protein post-translational modification (PTM) research based on large-scale proteomic work, there is an increasing demand for a suitable repository to analyze PTM data. Here we present a curated, web-accessible PTM data base, SysPTM. SysPTM provides a systematic and sophisticated platform for proteomic PTM research equipped not only with a knowledge base of manually curated multi-type modification data but also with four fully developed, in-depth data mining tools. Currently, SysPTM contains data detailing 117,349 experimentally determined PTM sites on 33,421 proteins involving nearly 50 PTM types, curated from public resources including five data bases and four web servers and more than one hundred peer-reviewed mass spectrometry papers. Protein annotations including Pfam domains, KEGG pathways, GO functional classification, and ortholog groups are integrated into the data base. Four online tools have been developed and incorporated, including PTMBlast, to compare a user's PTM dataset with PTM data in SysPTM; PTMPathway, to map PTM proteins to KEGG pathways; PTMPhylog, to discover potentially conserved PTM sites; and PTMCluster, to find clusters of multi-site modifications. The workflow of SysPTM was demonstrated by analyzing an in-house phosphorylation dataset identified by MS/MS. It is shown that in SysPTM, the role of single-type and multi-type modifications can be systematically investigated in a full biological context. SysPTM could be an important contribution to modificomics research. SysPTM is freely available online at www.sysbio.ac.cn/SysPTM.",

One of the greatest challenges in cancer chemotherapy is that seemingly identical cancer cells can respond differently to drug treatment. The pioneering work reported by Cohen and colleagues moves one step closer to solving this challenge. They develop a dynamic proteomics approach that utilizes fluorescent markers and a time-lapse microscope to detect the fluctuating locations and levels of approximately 1000 proteins in individual cancer cells at high temporal resolution. After adminstration of the cancer drug camptothecin, certain proteins display similar spatiotemporal distribution patterns in individual cells; for example, the drug target topoisomerase-1 shows a rapid decrease in protein level and in nuclear location. However, two particular proteins demonstrate cell-cell variability in their behavior corresponding to cell fate, which may help to explain drug resistance. This method offers an effective way to investigate drug mechanisms in individual cells.",

To solve these problems, we developed a new domestic parallel software package called QuantWiz for high performance liquid chromatography (short for LC)-MS-based label-free protein quantification. In this paper, we described the framework design and prototype development of this high performance software package firstly. Also, user interface developed for the visualization of QuantWiz is introduced.

        "abstract": "Proteomics was used to identify a protein encoded by ORF 3a in a SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Immuno-blotting revealed that interchain disulfide bonds might be formed between this protein and the spike protein. ELISA indicated that sera from SARS patients have significant positive reactions with synthesized peptides derived from the 3a protein. These results are concordant with that of a spike protein-derived peptide. A tendency exists for co-mutation between the 3a protein and the spike protein of SARS-CoV isolates, suggesting that the function of the 3a protein correlates with the spike protein. Taken together, the 3a protein might be tightly correlated to the spike protein in the SARS-CoV functions. The 3a protein may serve as a new clinical marker or drug target for SARS treatment.",

Most of the research examining the epididymis to date has been limited to the study of the secreted proteins involved in the maturation of spermatozoa. However, it is also very important to understand the protein components, regulation and function of the tissue itself since these are the basis for all of its physiological processes. We investigated the differential expression of proteins among the caput, corpus, and cauda regions of rat epididymis and considered the possible links between the localization of these proteins and the different functions of these epididymal regions. High-resolution 2-D gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry (MS) revealed 28 distinct proteins whose expression levels varied from the caput to the cauda epididymis. Sixteen of them were reported for first time to be expressed in the epididymis. Expression patterns of some proteins were validated by Northern blot or Western blot. Immunohistochemistry revealed that inducible carbonyl reductase (iCR), an important enzyme in the anti-oxidative system, exhibits primary and cell-type specific distribution in the distal cauda region. Moreover, analysis of iCR transcription in castrated animals showed that its expression is androgen-dependent. Together with its known functions, iCR may also be involved in androgen metabolism and maintaining a steady microenvironment in the duct of epididymis.",

By combining computational prediction and high-accuracy tandem mass spectra, we revised the genome annotation of Leptospira interrogans serovar Lai, a free-living pathogenic spirochete responsible for leptospirosis, providing substantial peptide evidence for novel genes and new gene boundaries. Subsequently, we presented a high-coverage proteome analysis of protein expression and multiple posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Approximately 64.3% of the predicted L. interrogans proteins were cataloged by detecting 2 540 proteins. Meanwhile, a profile of multiple PTMs was concurrently established, containing in total 32 phosphorylated, 46 acetylated and 155 methylated proteins. The PTM systems in the serovar Lai show unique features. Unique eukaryotic-like features of L. interrogans protein modifications were demonstrated in both phosphorylation and arginine methylation. This systematic analysis provides not only comprehensive information of high-coverage protein expression and multiple modifications in prokaryotes but also a view suggesting that the evolutionarily primitive L. interrogans shares significant similarities in protein modification systems with eukaryotes.",

        "abstract": "The virulence-attenuated Leptospira interrogans serovar Lai strain IPAV was derived by prolonged laboratory passage from a highly virulent ancestral strain isolated in China. We studied the genetic variations of IPAV that render it avirulent via comparative analysis against the pathogenic L. interrogans serovar Lai strain 56601. The complete genome sequence of the IPAV strain was determined and used to compare with, and then rectify and reannotate the genome sequence of strain 56601. Aside from their highly similar genomic structure and gene order, a total of 33 insertions, 53 deletions and 301 single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) were detected throughout the genome of IPAV directly affecting 101 genes, either in their 5' upstream region or within their coding region. Among them, the majority of the 44 functional genes are involved in signal transduction, stress response, transmembrane transport and nitrogen metabolism. Comparative proteomic analysis based on quantitative liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS data revealed that among 1 627 selected pairs of orthologs, 174 genes in the IPAV strain were upregulated, with enrichment mainly in classes of energy production and lipid metabolism. In contrast, 228 genes in strain 56601 were upregulated, with the majority enriched in the categories of protein translation and DNA replication/repair. The combination of genomic and proteomic approaches illustrated that altered expression or mutations in critical genes, such as those encoding a Ser/Thr kinase, carbon-starvation protein CstA, glutamine synthetase, GTP-binding protein BipA, ribonucleotide-diphosphate reductase and phosphate transporter, and alterations in the translational profile of lipoproteins or outer membrane proteins are likely to account for the virulence attenuation in strain IPAV.",

        "abstract": "Morphologically, caveolae and lipid rafts are two different membrane structures. They are often reported to share similar lipid and protein compositions, and are considered to be two subtypes of membrane lipid microdomains. By modifying sucrose density gradient flotation centrifugation, which is used to isolate lipid microdomains, we were able to separate caveolae and noncaveolar lipid microdomains into two distinct fractions. The caveolar membranes are membrane vesicles of 100-nm diameter, enriched with caveolin-1 and flotillin-1. The noncaveolar lipid microdomains are amorphous membranes and most likely the coalescence of heterogeneous lipid rafts. They are depleted of caveolin-1 and are more enriched with cholesterol and sphingolipids than the caveolae. Many membrane proteins, such as insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (membrane receptor), aquaporin-1 (membrane transporter), Thy-1 and N-cadherin (glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein and membrane glycoprotein), are specifically associated with noncaveolar lipid microdomains, but not with caveolae. These results indicate that the lipid and protein compositions of caveolae differ from those of noncaveolar lipid microdomains. The difference in their protein compositions implies that these two membrane microdomains may have different cellular functions.",

        "abstract": "Recently developed DNA base editing methods enable direct generation of desired point mutation in genomic DNA without generating any double-strand breaks (DSBs), yet the issue of off-target edits have limited the application of these methods. While several previous studies have evaluated off-target mutations in genomic DNA, it is now appreciated that the deaminases integral to commonly used DNA base editors often exhibit RNA binding activity. For example, the cytosine deaminase APOBEC1 used in cytosine base editors (CBEs) was found to target both DNA and RNA, and the adenine deaminase TadA used in adenine base editors (ABEs) was found to induce site-specific inosine formation on RNA. However, any potential RNA mutations caused by DNA base editors has not been evaluated. Adeno-associated viruses are the most common delivery system for DNA editing gene therapies; these viruses can sustain long-term gene expression in vivo, so the extent of potential RNA mutation induced by DNA base editors is of great concern[REMOVED HYPERLINK FIELD]. Here, we quantitatively evaluated the RNA single nucleotide variations (SNVs) induced by CBEs and by ABEs. We found that both the cytosine base editor BE3 and the adenine base editor ABE7.10 generate tens of thousands of off-target RNA SNVs. Subsequently, by engineering deaminases, we found that three CBE variants and one ABE variant reduced off-target RNA SNVs to the baseline while maintaining their efficient DNA on-target activity. This study reveals a previously overlooked aspect of off-target effects in DNA editing and also demonstrates that such effects can be eliminated by engineering deaminases.",

        "abstract": "One of the major problems in shotgun proteomics is the low peptide coverage when analyzing complex protein samples. Identifying more peptides, e.g. non-tryptic peptides, may increase the peptide coverage and improve protein identification and/or quantification that are based on the peptide identification results. Searching for all potential non-tryptic peptides is, however, time consuming for shotgun proteomics data from complex samples, and poses a challenge for a routine data analysis.We hypothesize that non-tryptic peptides are mainly created from the truncation of regular tryptic peptides before separation. We introduce the notion of truncatability of a tryptic peptide, i.e. the probability of the peptide to be identified in its truncated form, and build a predictor to estimate a peptide's truncatability from its sequence. We show that our predictions achieve useful accuracy, with the area under the ROC curve from 76% to 87%, and can be used to filter the sequence database for identifying truncated peptides. After filtering, only a limited number of tryptic peptides with the highest truncatability are retained for non-tryptic peptide searching. By applying this method to identification of semi-tryptic peptides, we show that a significant number of such peptides can be identified within a searching time comparable to that of tryptic peptide identification.",

        "abstract": "Acute light-induced photoreceptor degeneration has been studied in experimental animals as a model for photoreceptor cell loss in human retinal degenerative diseases. Light absorption by rhodopsin in rod photoreceptor outer segments (OS) induces oxidative stress and initiates apoptotic cell death. However, the molecular events that induce oxidative stress and initiate the apoptotic cascade remain poorly understood. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of light-induced photoreceptor cell death, we studied the proteomic changes in OS upon intense light exposure by using a proteolytic (18)O labeling method. Of 171 proteins identified, the relative abundance of 98 proteins in light-exposed and unexposed OS was determined. The quantities of 11 proteins were found to differ by more than 2-fold between light-exposed OS and those remaining in darkness. Among the 11 proteins, 8 were phototransduction proteins and 7 of these were altered such that the efficiency of phototransduction would be reduced or quenched during light exposure. In contrast, the amount of OS rhodopsin kinase was reduced by 2-fold after light exposure, suggesting attenuation in the mechanism of quenching phototransduction. Liquid chromatography multiple reaction monitoring (LC-MRM) was performed to confirm this reduction in the quantity of rhodopsin kinase. As revealed by immunofluorescence microscopy, this reduction of rhodopsin kinase is not a result of protein translocation from the outer to the inner segment. Collectively, our findings suggest that the absolute quantity of rhodopsin kinase in rod photoreceptors is reduced upon light stimulation and that this reduction may be a contributing factor to light-induced photoreceptor cell death. This report provides new insights into the proteomic changes in the OS upon intense light exposure and creates a foundation for understanding the mechanisms of light-induced photoreceptor cell death.",

        "abstract": "Hepatic insulin resistance and hepatosteatosis in diet-induced obesity are associated with various metabolic diseases, yet the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Here we show that the expression levels of the disulfide-bond A oxidoreductase-like protein (DsbA-L) are significantly reduced in the liver of obese mice and humans. Liver-specific knockout or adenovirus-mediated overexpression of DsbA-L exacerbates or alleviates, respectively, high-fat diet-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, hepatosteatosis, and insulin resistance in mice. Mechanistically, we found that DsbA-L is localized in mitochondria and that its deficiency is associated with impairment of maximum respiratory capacity, elevated cellular oxidative stress, and increased JNK activity. Our results identify DsbA-L as a critical regulator of mitochondrial function, and its down-regulation in the liver may contribute to obesity-induced hepatosteatosis and whole body insulin resistance.-Chen, H., Bai, J., Dong, F., Fang, H., Zhang, Y., Meng, W., Liu, B., Luo, Y., Liu, M., Bai, Y., Abdul-Ghani, M.

Microarrays, however, do not estimate absolute expression level accurately. At present, high throughput sequencing is emerging as an alternative methodology for transcriptome studies. Although free of many limitations imposed by microarray design, its potential to estimate absolute transcript levels is unknown.In this study, we evaluate relative accuracy of microarrays and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) using third methodology: proteomics. We find that RNA-Seq provides a better estimate of absolute expression levels.Our result shows that in terms of overall technical performance, RNA-Seq is the technique of choice for studies that require accurate estimation of absolute transcript levels.",

        "abstract": "Even though mRNA expression levels are commonly used as a proxy for estimating functional differences that occur at the protein level, the relation between mRNA and protein expression is not well established. Further, no study to date has tested whether the evolutionary differences in mRNA expression observed between species reflect those observed in protein expression. Since a large proportion of mRNA expression differences observed between mammalian species appears to have no functional consequences for the phenotype, it is conceivable that many or most mRNA expression differences are not reflected at the protein level. If this is true, then differences in protein expression may largely reflect functional adaptations observed in species phenotypes. In this paper, we present the first direct comparison of mRNA and protein expression differences seen between humans and chimpanzees. We reproducibly find a significant positive correlation between mRNA expression and protein expression differences. This correlation is comparable in magnitude to that found between mRNA and protein expression changes at different developmental stages or in different physiological conditions within one species. Noticeably, this correlation is mainly due to genes with large expression differences between species. Our study opens the door to a new level of understanding of regulatory evolution and poses many new questions that remain to be answered.",

Here, using high-throughput transcriptome sequencing, we have characterized splicing changes that take place during whole human lifespan in two brain regions: prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. Identified changes were confirmed using independent human and rhesus macaque RNA-seq data sets, exon arrays and PCR, and were detected at the protein level using mass spectrometry. Splicing changes across lifespan were abundant in both of the brain regions studied, affecting more than a third of the genes expressed in the human brain. Approximately 15% of these changes differed between the two brain regions. Across lifespan, splicing changes followed discrete patterns that could be linked to neural functions, and associated with the expression profiles of the corresponding splicing factors. More than 60% of all splicing changes represented a single splicing pattern reflecting preferential inclusion of gene segments potentially targeting transcripts for nonsense-mediated decay in infants and elderly.",

        "abstract": "Among other factors, changes in gene expression on the human evolutionary lineage have been suggested to play an important role in the establishment of human-specific phenotypes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these expression changes are largely unknown. Here, we have explored the role of microRNA (miRNA) in the regulation of gene expression divergence among adult humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques, in two brain regions: prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. Using a combination of high-throughput sequencing, miRNA microarrays, and Q-PCR, we have shown that up to 11% of the 325 expressed miRNA diverged significantly between humans and chimpanzees and up to 31% between humans and macaques. Measuring mRNA and protein expression in human and chimpanzee brains, we found a significant inverse relationship between the miRNA and the target genes expression divergence, explaining 2%-4% of mRNA and 4%-6% of protein expression differences. Notably, miRNA showing human-specific expression localize in neurons and target genes that are involved in neural functions. Enrichment in neural functions, as well as miRNA-driven regulation on the human evolutionary lineage, was further confirmed by experimental validation of predicted miRNA targets in two neuroblastoma cell lines. Finally, we identified a signature of positive selection in the upstream region of one of the five miRNA with human-specific expression, miR-34c-5p. This suggests that miR-34c-5p expression change took place after the split of the human and the Neanderthal lineages and had adaptive significance. Taken together these results indicate that changes in miRNA expression might have contributed to evolution of human cognitive functions. \u00a9 2011 Hu et al.",

        "abstract": "Human evolution is characterized by the rapid expansion of brain size and drastic increase in cognitive capabilities. It has long been suggested that these changes were accompanied by modifications of brain metabolism. Indeed, human-specific changes on gene expression or amino acid sequence were reported for a number of metabolic genes, but actual metabolite measurements in humans and apes have remained scarce. Here, we investigate concentrations of more than 100 metabolites in the prefrontal and cerebellar cortex in 49 humans, 11 chimpanzees, and 45 rhesus macaques of different ages using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). We show that the brain metabolome undergoes substantial changes, both ontogenetically and evolutionarily: 88% of detected metabolites show significant concentration changes with age, whereas 77% of these metabolic changes differ significantly among species. Although overall metabolic divergence reflects phylogenetic relationships among species, we found a fourfold acceleration of metabolic changes in prefrontal cortex compared with cerebellum in the human lineage. These human-specific metabolic changes are paralleled by changes in expression patterns of the corresponding enzymes, and affect pathways involved in synaptic transmission, memory, and learning.",

        "abstract": "Both CO and N2O are important environmentally harmful industrial gases. The reaction of CO and N2O to produce CO2 and N2 has stimulated much research interest aimed at degradation of these two gases in a single step. Herein, we report an efficient CO oxidation by N2O catalyzed by a (PNN)Ru-H pincer complex under mild conditions, even with no added base. The reaction is proposed to proceed through a sequence of O-atom transfer (OAT) from N2O to the Ru-H bond to form a Ru-OH intermediate, followed by intramolecular OH attack on an adjacent CO ligand, forming CO2 and N2. Thus, the Ru-H bond of the catalyst plays a central role in facilitating the O-atom transfer from N2O to CO, providing an efficient and novel protocol for CO oxidation.",

We report the homogeneously catalyzed reaction of nitrous oxide (N2O) with H2. The reaction is catalyzed by a PNP pincer ruthenium complex, generating efficiently only dinitrogen and water, under mild conditions, thus providing a green, mild methodology for removal of nitrous oxide. The reaction proceeds through a sequence of dihydrogen activation, \u201cO\u201d-atom transfer, and dehydration, in which metal\u2013ligand cooperation plays a central role.

        "abstract": "The association between mineralization and hydrocarbons in sedimentary basins is widely recognized, but the nature and significance of their relationships are not fully understood. This paper provides an example of metalliferous brines injecting into a palaeo-oil\u2013gas reservoir to form a world-class Zn\u2013Pb deposit (Jinding, China). Petrographic and microthermometric studies of oil inclusions and PVT simulations suggest that oil and gas were charged in a shallow (u003c1300 m) environment before mineralization. This environment favoured bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR), which produced large amounts of H2S that accumulated in the gas cap. Forceful injection of hot brines penetrated the oil zone to reach the H2S-rich gas cap and precipitated sulfide ores. Individual fluid injection events were short-lived, and the reservoir was only partly and briefly heated to beyond the bacterial survival temperature. Episodic injection of metalliferous brines and sustained supply of H2S through BSR resulted in the formation of a large Zn\u2013Pb deposit.This article is protected by copyright.

The spinnability plays an important role in predicting fracture and controlling the shape of the profiled component. In this paper, a 3D finite element (FE) model is established so as to investigate on the spinnability of the ellipsoidal power spinning. The variation of the equivalent stress and the equivalent plastic strain are analyzed, and the analysis of variance takes comprehensive influence on the spinnability into consideration. The fracture behaviors of the ellipsoidal components are analyzed with the Johnson\u2013Cook fracture criterion. The results show that the equivalent stress and the equivalent plastic strain increase with the forming time. As for the mono-factor influence, the spinnability is improved when the feed rate of the rollers decreases or the friction coefficient increases. As for the multi-factor influence, the interaction between the feed rate and the friction coefficient has a significant effect on the spinnability. The initial fracture is presented in the fillet part between the blank and the mandrel where the equivalent plastic strain reaches the maximum, the stress triaxiality is the minimum, and the Johnson\u2013Cook damage initiation criterion approach one. The simulation results using the Johnson\u2013Cook fracture criterion are in a good agreement with the experimental results during the ellipsoidal power spinning.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The microstructural evolution of 300M steel during the isothermal treatment between deformations is studied. Firstly, interrupt compressions of 300M steel at temperature of 1273K and strain rate of 0.01s -1  are conducted to figure out the kinetics of static recrystallization (SRX) and meta-dynamic recrystallization (MDRX), subsequently an in situ heat treatment experiment is designed to measure the amount of strain induced grain boundary migration (SIGBM) and compared with interrupt compressions. The results show that MDRX is verified to have a lower nucleation rate than SRX in 300M steel. In addition, SIGBMs mainly appear at the triple junctions, and the amount of SIGBMs during SRX and MDRX both reach the maximum value between the steady state time and the time of 50% fraction softening. Finally, the grain growth driven by SIGBMs dominates the subsequent isothermal treatment after the new round of nucleation induced by MDRX and SRX.",

The characteristics of pole-to-ground (PTG) fault under different system grounding schemes are analyzed. Then, the principle of enhanced control strategy to deal with the PTG fault is presented for a hybrid-MMC-based HVDC system with symmetrical monopolar configuration. A new control variable is proposed on the arm voltages to distribute the power transmitted from the ac side between the upper and lower arms. By adopting the enhanced control, the overvoltage and the fault current can be eliminated when a PTG fault occurs. Furthermore, the hybrid-MMC-based HVDC system can operate continuously with adjustable active power and controllable reactive power by controlling the upper and lower arms of the converter asymmetrically during a fault period. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed control scheme is verified by simulation results in PSCAD/EMTDC.",

A comprehensive overview of MMC on DC fault ride-through (FRT) capability is discussed. Compared with DC fault blocking capability considered as a passive DC FRT strategy focusing on isolating DC fault from AC sides, the DC FRT capability emphasises remaining converters continuous operating during DC faults to regulate and support the connected AC grids. The principle and prerequisite of MMC on DC FRT are analysed, and then improved MMC topologies with DC fault handling capability are summarised and a corresponding comparison among them is conducted. Finally, applications of MMC with DC FRT capability on HVDC systems and its relative control strategies are presented.",

The mechanism of this issue is analyzed, and then a solution based on fundamental-frequency reactive circulating current (FFRCC) injection is proposed. The influence of FFRCC injection is analyzed in terms of the fluctuated arm capacitor energy and the current stress of semiconductors.

A minimum noise figure (NFmin) of 2.0 dB and an associate gain (Gass) of 10.3 dB were achieved at 10 GHz in 0.3-\u03bcm-gate-length device.

        "abstract": "Repeated infection with high-risk HPV is a major cause for the development and metastasis of human cervical cancer, even though the mechanism of the metastasis is still not completely understood. Here, we reported that miR-218 (microRNA-218) was downregulated in cervical cancer tissues, especially in metastatic cancer tissues. We found that miR-218 expression was associated with clinicopathological characteristics of patients with cervical cancer. MiR-218 overexpression inhibited Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), migration and invasiveness of cervical cancer cells in vitro. Moreover, miR-218 repressed the expression of SFMFBT1 (Scm-like with four MBT domains 1) and DCUN1D1 (defective in cullin neddylation 1, domain containing 1) by direct binding to the 3'UTRs of the mRNAs. The overexpression of SFMBT1 induced EMT and increased the migration and invasiveness of cervical cancer cells, while the overexpression of DCUN1D1 increased the migration and invasiveness of these cells, but did not induce EMT. An inverse correlation was observed between the expression of miR-218 and DCUN1D1 protein in cervical cancer tissues. Importantly, HPV16 E6 downregulated the expression of miR-218 in cervical cancer, while miR-218 rescued the promotion effect of HPV16 E6 on the expression of SFMBT1 and DCUN1D1. Taken together, our results revealed that HPV16 E6 promoted EMT and invasion in cervical cancer via the repression of miR-218, while miR-218 inhibited EMT and invasion in cervical cancer by targeting SFMBT1 and DCUN1D1.",

        "abstract": "Although an increasing number of findings have proven that glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3) is methylated and down-regulated in various cancers, the underlying mechanism of its occurrence in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains unknown. In the present study, we found that the methylation rate in advanced cancers was significantly higher than that in early stage cancers by a methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, the proliferation and migration capacities of KYSE-510 cells were inhibited after up-regulating GPX3 expression by GPX3 lentivirus transfection. As expected, the proliferation and migration capacities of KYSE-150 cells were promoted after down-regulating GPX3 expression with siRNA interfering. Moreover, we found that GPX3 might have deactivated the FAK/AKT signaling pathway to lower the expression of MMP-9 to suppress the migration and invasive capacities of KYSE-150 and KYSE-510 cells. Our findings suggested that GPX3 played a pivotal role in the suppression of carcinogenesis and progression in ESCC, and GPX3 has the potential as a novel biomarker in the diagnosis of ESCC.",

        "abstract": "Occupational and environmental inhalation exposure to hexavalent chromium [Cr(vi)] compounds has been confirmed to cause respiratory system injury and cancer. The molecular mechanisms of chromium carcinogenesis still require further study. We established Cr(vi)-transformed cells (BEAS-2B-Cr) after chronic exposure of immortalized normal human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells to low doses of Cr(vi), which obtained the ability of anchorage-independent growth. BEAS-2B-Cr cells not only exhibited stronger proliferation, migration, invasion and tumorigenesis capabilities but also acquired an altered and distinct Gli2 gene expression pattern compared with untreated parental BEAS-2B cells (P-NC) and the control BEAS-2B cells (NC). Interestingly, we found that activation of Gli2 by Cr(vi) treatment prevented the induction of autophagy. Using a gene silencing approach, we showed that Gli2 plays an important role in the malignant properties of BEAS-2B-Cr cells. Downregulation of Gli2 induced autophagy and inhibited cell proliferation and colony forming abilities, which are both upregulated in BEAS-2B-Cr cells compared to NC cells. In addition, inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) partially suppressed the cytotoxicity induced by GANT61-induced inhibition of Gli2. These results demonstrate that hexavalent chromium Cr(vi) activates Gli2 to promote the proliferation of BEAS-2B-Cr cells by inhibition of autophagy, which contributes to human bronchial epithelial cell carcinogenesis. Gli2 may not only play an important role in lung cancer pathogenesis, but also be a promising early indicator in monitoring exposure to chromium.",

        "abstract": "EPB41L3 may play a role as a metastasis suppressor by supporting regular arrangements of actin stress fibres and alleviating the increase in cell motility associated with enhanced metastatic potential. Downregulation of epb41l3 has been observed in many cancers, but the role of this gene in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains unclear. Our study aimed to determine the effect of epb41l3 on ESCC cell migration and invasion. We investigated epb41l3 protein expression in tumour and non-tumour tissues by immunohistochemical staining. Expression in the non-neoplastic human esophageal cell line Het-1a and four ESCC cell lines \u2013 Kyse150, Kyse510, Kyse450 and Caes17 \u2013 was assessed by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) and Western blotting. Furthermore, an EPB41L3 overexpression plasmid and EPB41L3-specific small interfering RNA were used to upregulate EPB41L3 expression in Kyse150 cells and to downregulate EPB41L3 expression in Kyse450 cells, respectively. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated by wound healing and transwell assays, respectively. The expression levels of p-AKT, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 and MMP9 were evaluated. Expression of epb41l3 was significantly lower in tumour tissues than in non-tumour tissues and in ESCC cell lines compared with the Het-1a cell line. Kyse450 and Caes17 cells exhibited higher expression of epb41l3 than Kyse150 and Kyse510 cells. Overexpressing epb41l3 decreased Kyse150 cell migration and invasion, whereas EPB41L3-specific small interfering RNA silencing increased these functions in Kyse450 cells. Furthermore, overexpressing epb41l3 led to downregulation of MMP2 and MMP9 in Kyse150 and Kyse510 cells. Our findings reveal that EPB41L3 suppresses tumour cell invasion and inhibits MMP2 and MMP9 expression in ESCC cells. Copyright \u00a9 2016 John Wiley u0026 Sons, Ltd.",

Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between different dietary protein sources and breast cancer risk. PubMed and several databases were searched until December 2015. Relevant articles were retrieved according to specific searching criteria. Forty-six prospective studies were included. The summary relative risk (RR) for highest versus lowest intake was 1.07 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01\u20131.14, I2 = 34.6%) for processed meat, 0.92 (95% CI 0.84\u20131.00, I2 = 0%) for soy food, 0.93 (95% CI 0.85\u20131.00, I2 = 40.1%) for skim milk, and 0.90 (95% CI 0.82\u20131.00, I2 = 0%) for yogurt. Similar conclusions were obtained in dose-response association for each serving increase: total red meat (RR: 1.07; 95% CI 1.01\u20131.14, I2 = 7.1%), fresh red meat (RR: 1.13; 95% CI 1.01\u20131.26, I2 = 56.4%), processed meat (RR: 1.09; 95% CI 1.02\u20131.17, I2 = 11.8%), soy food (RR: 0.91; 95% CI 0.84\u20131.00, I2 = 0%), and skim milk (RR: 0.96; 95% CI 0.92\u20131.00, I2 = 11.9%). There was a null association between poultry, fish, egg, nuts, total milk, and whole milk intake and breast cancer risk. Higher total red meat, fresh red meat, and processed meat intake may be risk factors for breast cancer, whereas higher soy food and skim milk intake may reduce the risk of breast cancer.",

The novel trigeneration system mainly consists of a biomass gasifier, a solar collector, an internal combustion engine, an absorption unit and a liquid desiccant unit. The solar collector provides steam for biomass gasification process, and the product gas is fed into the internal combustion engine for generating electricity. The flue gas is utilized by the absorption unit for cooling production, and heat exchanger for domestic hot water successively. The jacket water is considered as the low heat resource for generating desiccant capacity. The exergy efficiency, exergy destruction and CO 2  emissions are analyzed under different parameters. The results show that the total exergy efficiency of trigeneration system in the case study is determined to 19.21%, and the solar energy contributes to decrease the consumption of biomass. It is also found that the highest exergy destruction takes place in the gasifier, follow by internal combustion engine and gas/water heat exchanger. In addition, the introduction of biomass and solar energy alleviates the impact on environment, mainly reduces the CO 2  emissions in kg/MW\u00a0h; the CO 2  emissions decrease evidently compared with separated generation system.",

Especially, those trigeneration systems taking renewable energy as primary input are paid more and more attention. This paper presents a feasible trigeneration system, which realizes biomass and solar energy integrating effective utilization according to energy cascade utilization and energy level upgrading of chemical reaction principle. In the proposed system, the solar energy with mid-and-low temperature converted to the chemical energy of bio-gas through gasification process, then the bio-gas will be taken as the fuel for internal combustion engine (ICE) to generate electricity. The jacket water as a byproduct generated from ICE is utilized in a liquid desiccant unit for providing desiccant capacity. The flue gas is transported into an absorption chiller and heat exchanger consequently, supplying chilled water and domestic hot water. The thermodynamic performance of the trigeneration system was investigated by the help of Aspen plus. The results indicate that the overall energy efficiency and the electrical efficiency of the proposed system in case study are 77.4% and 17.8%, respectively. The introduction of solar energy decreases the consumption of biomass, and the solar thermal energy input fraction is 8.6%. In addition, the primary energy saving ratio and annual total cost saving ratio compared with the separated generation system are 16.7% and 25.9%, respectively.",

Therefore, a bio-gas and natural gas co-firing in combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system based on ground source heat pump is presented and modeled using exergetic and exergoeconomic methods. The exergy and exergy cost flows of CCHP system are presented under three different gas mass ratios and the influences of some key parameters (biomass and natural gas cost, interest rate, service life and operating time coefficient) on unit exergy cost of products are also analyzed. The results indicate that the introduction of natural gas improves the exergy efficiency; when the gas mass ratio varies from 0 to 1.0 the unit exergy cost of electricity generated by gas turbine, chilled water and hot water decrease from 11.26\u202f$/GJ, 92.21\u202f$/GJ and 69.92\u202f$/GJ to 3.84\u202f$/GJ, 43.52\u202f$/GJ and 23.73\u202f$/GJ, respectively. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis shows that unit exergy cost of products increases with the increasing of biomass cost, natural gas cost and interest rate; while decreases non-linearly with the increasing of service life and operating time coefficient. The proposed CCHP system provides an idea for other hybrid renewable energy system, and exergoeconomic methodology shows a better understanding of complex energy system performance in terms of both exergy and economic aspects.",

We show that forced-expression of MALAT1 using a lentiviral vector (\"LV-MALAT1\") significantly attenuated HO-induced death and apoptosis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Conversely, knocking down of MALAT1 by targeted siRNA exacerbated HO-induced HUVEC injury. For the mechanism study, we show that LV-MALAT1 induced Keap1 downregulation, leading to nuclear-factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) stabilization and activation. Critically, Nrf2 shRNA almost completely abolished LV-MALAT1-mediated HUVEC protection against HO. Significantly, HO-induced oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and DNA damages in HUVECs were attenuated by LV-MALAT1, but were intensified with MALAT1 siRNA. In summary, we indentified a novel signalling axis involving MALAT1, Keap1 and Nrf2, which in turn protects HUVECs from oxidative injury.",

        "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the treatment of choice for carotid stenosis. Some patients develop ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury after CEA. This study was designed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of melatonin on I/R injury in both rats and humans. To this end, 36 male rats were evaluated, and a double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) including 60 patients was performed. A rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was used to mimic cerebral I/R. After 2 hr of occlusion and 24 hr of reperfusion, blood samples and brain tissues were harvested for further assessments. Compared with the vehicle treatment, melatonin decreased the expression of nuclear factor \u03ba light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) and S100 calcium-binding protein \u03b2 (S100\u03b2) (p<0.05) and markedly increased the expression of nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (p<0.05). The participants in the RCT took 6 mg/day melatonin orally from 3 days before surgery to 3 days after surgery. Blood samples were drawn at the following times: baseline; pre-anesthesia; carotid reconstruction completion; and 6, 24, and 72 hr after CEA. Compared with the oral placebo treatment, melatonin decreased the expression of NF-\u03baB, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and S100\u03b2 (p<0.05) and increased the expression of Nrf2, SOD, CAT and GPx (p<0.05) in patients after CEA. Our findings suggested that melatonin could ameliorate brain I/R injury after CEA and that this outcome was essentially due to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin.

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and effectiveness of endovascular stenting for extracranial carotid artery aneurysms (ECAAs) and evaluate the mid-term outcomes.Twelve consecutive symptomatic patients (mean age 43.8\u200a\u00b1\u200a14.9 years; 8 men) with ECAAs who were treated with endovascular stenting between 1997 and 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical follow-up data including symptoms and neurological events were obtained from outpatient records. Imaging follow-up with duplex ultrasound and/or computed tomographic angiography (CTA) was performed to examine the aneurysm obliteration and patency of the stents at 3, 6, 12 months and yearly thereafter.A total of 5 true aneurysms and 7 pseudoaneurysms were included in our series. Neurological symptoms (n\u200a=\u200a5, 41.7%) and a pulsatile neck mass (n\u200a=\u200a5, 41.7%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Endovascular stenting procedures were technically successful in all cases; 3 patients received bare stents, and 9 patients received covered stents. No perioperative neurologic or cardiopulmonary complications occurred. Over a period of follow-ups (mean 21.8\u200a\u00b1\u200a25.1 months), all patients were alive and free from neurological or other adverse events. All aneurysms were completely excluded except for 1 patient who was exposed to a residual medium leaking into the aneurysm sac. No reintervention was performed in this specific patient because aneurysm growth or significant clinical symptoms did not occur. Recurrent restenosis assessed by CTA imaging at 12 months occurred in 1 (8.3%) patient in our series. Target lesion revascularization for this hemodynamic restenosis was treated with placement of an additional stent.In our series, endovascular stenting for ECAAs was found to be safe, effective, and proved to have promising mid-term results. Although long-term results need to be further explored, advantages including less procedure-related complications and a shorter recovery time make endovascular stenting an attractive option for ECAAs, especially for the patients who are unfit for traditional open surgery.",

        "abstract": "The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6) are coreceptors for Frizzled and transmit signals from the plasma membrane to the cytosol. However, the mechanism for LRP5/6 signal transmission remains undefined. Here, we identify cytoplasmic activation/proliferation-associated protein 2 (Caprin-2) as a LRP5/6-binding protein. Our data show that Caprin-2 stabilizes cytosolic beta-catenin and enhances lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1/T cell factor-dependent reporter gene activity as well as the expression of Wnt target genes in mammalian cells. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of Caprin-2 in zebrafish embryos inhibits Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and results in a dorsalized phenotype. Moreover, Caprin-2 facilitates LRP5/6 phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3, and thus enhances the interaction between Axin and LRP5/6. Therefore, Caprin-2 promotes activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway by regulating LRP5/6 phosphorylation.",

        "abstract": "The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway has a crucial role in embryonic development, stem cell maintenance and human disease. By screening a synthetic chemical library of lycorine derivatives, we identified 4-ethyl-5-methyl-5,6-dihydro-[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-j]phenanthridine (HLY78) as an activator of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, which acts in a Wnt ligand-dependent manner. HLY78 targets the DIX domain of Axin and potentiates the Axin-LRP6 association, thus promoting LRP6 phosphorylation and Wnt signaling transduction. Moreover, we identified the critical residues on Axin for HLY78 binding and showed that HLY78 may weaken the autoinhibition of Axin. In addition, HLY78 acts synergistically with Wnt in the embryonic development of zebrafish and increases the expression of the conserved hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) markers, runx1 and cmyb, in zebrafish embryos. Collectively, our study not only provides new insights into the regulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway by a Wnt-specific small molecule but also will facilitate therapeutic applications, such as HSC expansion.",

        "abstract": "Ubiquitination plays important and diverse roles in modulating protein functions. As a C2-WW-HECT-type ubiquitin ligase, Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1) commonly serves to regulate ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation in a number of signaling pathways. Here, we report a novel function of Smurf1 in regulating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling through targeting axin for nonproteolytic ubiquitination. Our data unambiguously demonstrate that Smurf1 ubiquitinates axin through Lys 29 (K29)-linked polyubiquitin chains. Unexpectedly, Smurf1-mediated axin ubiquitination does not lead to its degradation but instead disrupts its interaction with the Wnt coreceptors LRP5/6, which subsequently attenuates Wnt-stimulated LRP6 phosphorylation and represses Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. The inhibitory function of Smurf1 on Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is further evidenced by analysis with Smurf1 knockout murine embryonic fibroblasts. We next identified K789 and K821 in axin as the ubiquitination sites by Smurf1. Consistently, Smurf1 could neither disrupt the interaction of an axin(K789/821R) double mutant with LRP5/6 nor attenuate the phosphorylation of LRP6 in axin(K789/821R)-expressing cells. Collectively, our studies uncover Smurf1 as a new regulator for the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway via modulating the activity of axin.",

Previously, we uncovered NC043 as a small-molecule inhibitor of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Here, we identified CARF as the cellular target of NC043. We found that NC043 binds directly to CARF through forming a covalent bond with the Cys-516 residue of CARF. Further study revealed that CARF interacts with Dvl, which potentiates the Dvl-c-Jun-\u03b2-catenin-TCF transcriptional complex and thus promotes Wnt signaling activation. NC043 could disrupt the interaction between CARF and Dvl, thereby impairing Wnt signal transduction. In line with this, knockdown of CARF in zebrafish leads to impairment of embryonic development, hematopoietic stem cell generation and caudal fin regeneration. Collectively, we identified CARF as the cellular target of NC043 and revealed CARF as a positive regulator of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal transduction.",

        "abstract": "The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is essential for embryonic development and homeostasis, but excessive activation of this pathway is frequently observed in various human diseases, including cancer. Current therapeutic drugs targeting the Wnt pathway often lack sufficient efficacy, and new compounds targeting this pathway are therefore greatly needed. Here, we report that the plant-derived natural product parthenoide (PTL), a sesquiterpene lactone, inhibits Wnt signaling. We found that PTL dose-dependently inhibits Wnt3a- and CHIR-induced transcriptional activity assessed with the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor(TCF/LEF)-firefly luciferase (TOPFlash) assay in HEK293 cells. Further investigations revealed that PTL decreases levels of the transcription factors TCF4/LEF1 without affecting \u03b2-catenin stability or subcellular distribution. Moreover, this effect of PTL on TCF4/LEF1 was related to protein synthesis rather than to proteasome-mediated degradation. Of note, siRNA-mediated knockdown of RPL10, a ribosome protein that PTL binds, substantially decreased TCF4/LEF1 protein levels and also Wnt3a-induced TOPFlash activities, suggesting a potential mechanism by which PTL may repress Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. In summary, PTL binds RPL10 and thereby potently inhibits the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway.",

The theropod dominated locality also reveals the second report of the avian theropod ichnogenus  Wupus , one of the largest avian traces currently known from the Lower Cretaceous. The Linjiang site provides evidence to support previous interpretations of a distinctive Lower Cretaceous theropod-dominated ichnofauna that was widespread in China and East Asia and highlights the similarity between Lower Cretaceous theropod ichnotaxa in East Asia and those found in the Lower Jurassic both in East Asia and elsewhere. These similarities in turn create various ichnotaxonomic challenges familiar to researchers working on theropod tracks, and we recommend caution in the naming of new theropod ichnotaxa at the ichnogenus level.",

        "abstract": "Conventional frequency preshift technology cannot distinguish between the large Doppler shift and the frequency offset aroused by crystal oscillator, which significantly hinders the system performance improvement in high mobility environments when the frequency offset is present. In this paper, a joint frequency offset and Doppler shift estimation algorithm in high mobility environment based on orthogonal angle domain subspace projection is proposed, which can track the fast time-varying Doppler shift and separate the Doppler shift from the frequency offset. First, an orthogonal angle domain subspace projection algorithm is proposed to project the Doppler spread caused by high mobility into equivalent Doppler shifts in each orthogonal subspace. Second, it utilizes equivalent Doppler shift of all orthogonal subspaces to jointly estimate the maximal Doppler shift and frequency offset. Finally, the estimates are used to compensate the frequency error in the received signal. Moreover, the maximum Doppler shift estimation, together with the projection vectors and the received power on each orthogonal subspace, is fed back and exploited in the subsequent transmitted signal. Simulation results show that the proposed method can estimate the two parameters accurately and eliminate almost all the errors on the Doppler rapidly changing area when SNR is up to 15\u00a0dB. Compared with the conventional receiver with automatic frequency control, the receiver with our proposed method achieves better system performance even on the Doppler rapidly changing area.",

        "abstract": "To reduce the consumption of non-renewable energy in the building sector, single-phase grid-connected voltage source converter (VSC) has been widely used to integrate distributed energy resources (DERs) into the building electrical network. As the increasing penetration of DERs into the electrical power system, new grid codes require the DERs should become more interactive and flexible while operating with the utility grid. Some functionalities may include grid fault operation and support capabilities, such as fault ride through, Volt/VAr support, etc. However, these new advanced functions might bring functionality conflict with the existing functions, such as anti-islanding protention. In this paper, the behaviors of single-phase grid-connected VSC under various grid conditions, such as voltage sag and unintentional power outage, are investigated. Following the analysis, a coordinated reactive control strategy including grid status identification criteria development and reactive curve designing, is proposed to enhance the performance of the converter on descriminating various grid status with multiple functionality conflict consideration. Simulation studies are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed control strategy.",

To enhance converteru0027s power density, the conventional active power decoupling (APD) techniques were adopted to reduce the DC capacitance by compensating the inherent second-order harmonic power ripples in the single-phase VSC. However, it would potentially make the DC voltage vulnerable to transient power ripples, which is a critical issue for the grid-connected renewable energy source (RES) system during grid faults. The proposed DC-bus stabilizer can not only compensate the second-order harmonic power ripples at normal operation, but also enhance the fault ride-through capability of the converter. The circuit topology and its corresponding control strategy are presented, and then simulation results are provided to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed DC-bus stabilizer under normal operation and grid fault condition.",

        "abstract": "Cancer secretomes are a promising source for biomarker discovery. The analysis of cancer secretomes still faces some difficulties mainly related to the intracellular contamination, which hinders the qualification and follow-up validations. This study aimed to establish a high-quality secretome of A549 cells by using the cellular proteome as a reference and to test the merits of this refined secretome for biomarker discovery for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we comprehensively investigated the secretome and the concurrent cellular proteome of A549 cells. A high-quality secretome consisting of 382 proteins was refined from 889 initial secretory proteins. More than 85.3% of proteins were annotated as secreted and 76.8% as extracellular or membrane-bound. The discriminative power of the lung-cancer associated secretome was confirmed by gene expression and serum proteomic data. The elevated level of C4b-binding Protein (C4BP) in NSCLC blood was verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA, p = 6.07e-6). Moreover, the serum C4BP level in 89 patients showed a strong association with the clinical staging of NSCLC. Our reference-experiment-driven strategy is simple and widely applicable, and may facilitate the identification of novel promising biomarkers of lung cancer.",

        "abstract": "Glutaryl 7-aminocephalosporanic acid acylase of Pseudomonas sp. 130 (C130) was irreversibly inhibited in a time-dependent manner by two substrate analogs bearing side chains of variable length, namely 7-bro- moacetyl aminocephalosporanic acid (BA-7-ACA) and 7-3-bromopropionyl aminocephalosporanic acid (BP-7- ACA). The inhibition of the enzyme with BA-7-ACA was attributable to reaction with a single amino acid residue within the -subunit proven by comparative matrix as- sisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Further mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated that the fourth tryptophan residue of the -subunit, Trp-B4, was alkylated by BA-7-ACA. By 1H-13C HSQC spectroscopy of C130 labeled by BA-2-13C-7-ACA, it was shown that tryptophan residue(s) in the enzyme was alkylated, forming a carbon-carbon bond. Replac- ing Trp-B4 with other amino acid residues caused in- creases in Km, decreases in kcat, and instability of en- zyme activity. None of the mutant enzymes except W-B4Y could be affinity-alkylated, but all were compet- itively inhibited by BA-7-ACA. Kinetic studies revealed that both BA-7-ACA and BP-7-ACA could specifically al- kylate Trp-B4 of C130 as well as Tyr-B4 of the mutant W-B4Y. Because these alkylations were energy-requir- ing under physiological conditions, it is likely that the affinity labeling reactions were catalyzed by the C130 enzyme itself. The Trp-B4 residue is located in the mid- dle of a characteristic sandwich structure. There- fore, a large conformational alteration during inhibitor binding and transition state formation is likely and sug- gests that a major conformational change is induced by substrate binding during the course of catalysis.",

Initiated by C-C activation, this distinct [5-2+2] transformation provides a rapid entry to access various benzimidazolidinone derivatives, through which a wide range of isocyanates can be efficiently coupled with broad functional group tolerance. A modified one-pot process, combining Curtius rearrangement and C-C activation, was also achieved by using acyl azides as the starting materials. Detailed mechanistic study revealed a surprising double-decarbonylative reaction pathway. The novel reactivity discovered in this basic research is expected to shed light on developing new heterocycle formation methods through a C-C/isocyanate coupling.",

        "abstract": "AbstractA novel edible coating based on carboxymethyl cellulose (1.5%, CMC) containing ethanol extract of Impatiens balsamina L. stems, 0.07% citric acid, 0.5% sucrose ester, 1.0% calcium propionate and 0.5% glycerol was applied to \u201cXinyu\u201d tangerines to delay their ripening and prolong postharvest life during storage at 5C for 100 days. The addition of IB extract as antifungal components in the CMC coating had an inhibitory effect on mold growth, and the coated treatments significantly decreased decay rate and weight loss, maintained commercial quality and enhanced the activities of antioxidant and defense-related enzymes compared with the uncoated control group. The results suggested that by applying the complex coating, we can delay the ripening and prolong the postharvest life of \u201cXinyu\u201d tangerines.Practical ApplicationsEdible coatings could be an effective technology for obstructing pathogenic infection and delaying the ripening process of fruits and vegetables during the postharvest storage period. The effectiveness of an edible coating based on 1.5% CMC coating containing IB extract and other film-forming additives, in comparison with CMC coating without IB extract, was applied in \u201cXinyu\u201d tangerines in order to reduce the rate of decay and maintain the nutritional quality of fruit during postharvest storage. The results showed that complex coating was able to provide a barrier to the pathogen and gas by reducing decay rate and weight loss. Meanwhile, the degradation of the nutritional quality of \u201cXinyu\u201d tangerines was significantly delayed. The activities of SOD, CAT, POD, PAL and GLU were much higher in the complex coating treatment than in CMC coating alone and the control group. Our results suggest that the complex coating could be explored as a novel and potentially natural edible coating for preserving \u201cXinyu\u201d tangerines.",

Changes in decay rate, weight loss, quality parameters, respiration rate, and enzymatic activities of the coated and control samples were assessed at 10-day intervals for a 100-day storage period at 6\u00a0\u00b0C. The decay rate, weight loss, respiration rate and maleicdialdehyde (MDA) content were much lower in the FH-SA coated samples than in the control group. During the middle and later periods of storage, Nanfeng mandarin treated with FH-SA coating maintained good fruit quality. The FH-SA coating treatment enhanced the activities of antioxidant and defense-related enzymes such as superoxyde dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), chitinase (CHI), \u03b2-1,3-glucanase (GLU), and phenylalanine ammonialyase (PAL), and stimulated the accumulation of phenolic compounds. Our study suggests that FH-SA coating has the potential to enhance the long term quality and storage of Nanfeng mandarin.",

The electron Hall mobility of 1.2x10^4 cm2/Vs at 2 K was obtained in our tri-layered heterostructures grown under 1x10^-5 Torr, which was significantly higher than that in single layer 5 uc LAO (~ 4x10^3 cm2/Vs) epitaxially grown on (100) STO substrates under the same conditions. It is believed that the enhancement of dielectric permittivity in the polar insulating trilayer can screen the electric field thus reducing the carrier effective mass of the two dimensional electron gas formed at the TiO2 interfacial layer in the substrate, resulting in a largely enhanced mobility, as suggested by the first-principle calculation. Our results will pave the way for designing high mobility oxide nanoelectronic devices based on LAO/STO heterostructures.",

        "abstract": "Clarification of the role of magnetic ordering and scattering in two-dimensional electron gas has become increasingly important to understand the transport and magnetic behavior in the LaAlO3 (LAO)/SrTiO3 (STO) heterostructures. In this work, we report the sheet resistance of the LAO/STO heterostructures as functions of temperature, magnetic field, and field orientation. An unexpected resistance minimum was discovered at \u223c10 K under a sufficiently high in-plane magnetic field. An anisotropic magnetoresistance (MR) is clearly identified, indicating the presence of magnetic scattering which may be related to the interaction between itinerant electrons and localized magnetic moments in the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures. It is believed that the high concentration of oxygen vacancies induced by the ultralow oxygen partial pressure during the deposition process plays a predominant role in the occurrence of the anisotropic MR.

Its main functions include bidirectional power flow, step-up and step-down operation and fault isolation equivalent to a DC circuit breaker. By contrast to the conventional MMC based DC/DC converter, the proposed DC/DC converter with hybrid MMC configuration has the advantage of being able to block the DC/DC converter terminal connecting to faulty DC grid section, while continue operating the other terminals connected to healthy DC grid sections. The proposed DC/DC converter operation is analyzed and its control is described.

        "title": "Analysis and Control of Modular Multilevel Converters under Asymmetric Arm Impedance Conditions",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a detailed analysis and improved control strategy for modular multilevel converters (MMC) under asymmetric arm inductance conditions. Unlike symmetric conditions, the fundamental ac current is not split equally between the upper and lower arms under asymmetric conditions and the dc and double-frequency components in the common-mode current also flow into the ac side. To solve these issues, a theoretical analysis of the effect of asymmetric conditions on MMC operation is carried out using equivalent circuits at different frequencies. Three control targets are then presented to enhance the operational performance. A control strategy providing the control of differential-mode current, common-mode current and power balance is designed. The feasibility and validity of the proposed analysis and control strategy are demonstrated by simulation results from a three-phase MMC system and simulation and experimental results from a single-phase MMC system.",
