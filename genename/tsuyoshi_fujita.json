        "abstract": "In the screening of novel antifungal compounds, yatakemycin was found in the culture broth of Streptomyces sp. TP-A0356. Yatakemycin was obtained by solvent extraction of the fermentation broth and chromatographic purification using ODS column and preparative HPLC. The structure of yatakemycin was elucidated by NMR and CID-MS/MS experiments as a novel antibiotic belonging to a family of CC-1065 and duocarmycins known to be DNA alkylating agents. Yatakemycin inhibited the growth of pathogenic fungi such as Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans with the MIC values of 0.01-0.03 microg/ml, more potent than amphotericin B (MIC: 0.1-0.5 microg/ml) or itraconazole (MIC: 0.03-0.2 microg/ml). It also showed potent cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines with the IC50 of 0.01-0.3 microg/ml.",

Previously, we separated two potent virulence factors, capsular polysaccharide (CPS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), from a clinical isolate of B. vulgatus and characterized the structure of CPS. In this study, we elucidated the structures of O-antigen polysaccharide (OPS) and lipid A in the LPS. LPS was subjected to weak acid hydrolysis to produce the lipid A fraction and polysaccharide fraction. Lipid A was isolated by preparative TLC, and its structure determined by MS and NMR to be similar to that of Bacteroides fragilis except for the number of fatty acids. The polysaccharide fraction was subjected to gel-filtration chromatography to give an OPS-rich fraction. The structure of OPS was determined by chemical analysis and NMR spectroscopy to be a polysaccharide composed of the following repeating unit: [-->4)alpha-L-Rhap(1-->3)beta-D-Manp(1-->].",

The structures were elucidated on the basis of 2D NMR and collision-induced dissociation MS/MS and turned out to be closely related homologues of AM7. Their weak membrane-disrupting activity indicates that the hydrophobic polyene chain is essential for the potent biological activities. Structure-activity relationship for the polyhydroxyl part was then examined with use of AM homologues possessing various chain lengths, indicating that the pore size of the channel/lesion formed by AMs was not greatly affected by the length of the polyhydroxyl chain.",

In the screening of inhibitors of anchorage-independent growth of tumor cells, anicemycin was isolated from the fermentation broth of an actinomycete strain TP-A0648. The producing strain was isolated from a leaf of Aucuba japonica collected in Toyama, Japan and identified as Streptomyces sp. based on the taxonomic data. The structure of anicemycin was elucidated as a new analog of spicamycin by NMR and MS analysis. Anicemycin inhibited the anchorage-independent growth of the human ovary cancer SKOV-3 cells with an IC50 of 0.015 microM about three times more potently than their anchorage-dependent growth.",

The charge-remote fragmentations were facilitated by a negative charge introduced to a terminal amino group or to a hydroxyl group at the other terminus by a reaction with 2-sulfobenzoic acid cyclic anhydride. Product ions generated from the [M - H](-) ions provided information on the structural details of ostreocin-D. Comparisons between the spectral data for ostreocin-D and palytoxin also provided a rational basis for the assignments of product ions.",

        "abstract": "Heterocapsa circularisquama is known to cause lethal effect on bivalves, but toxic effect on fish has not been reported yet. Recently, we have found that H. circularisquama has potent light-dependent hemolytic toxins. Based on the chemical structural analysis, one of the hemolytic toxins named H2-a was found to be a novel porphyrin derivative with similar structure to pyropheophorbide a methyl ester (PME), a well-known photoactive hemolytic agent (Miyazaki et al., Aquatic Toxicol. 2005;73:382--393). To clarify the cytotoxic action mode of H2-a, we examined the effects of H2-a on HeLa cells in comparison with PME. The cytotoxicities of both reagents were strictly light dependent, and no significant cytotoxic effects including cellular morphological changes were induced without light illumination. The dose response curves revealed that H2-a showed stronger cytotoxicity to HeLa cells than PME. Fluorescence microscopic observation suggested that H2-a tends to accumulate in the plasma membrane, whereas PME seems to distribute entire cytoplasm. Although PME induced typical apoptotic nuclear morphological changes and DNA fragmentation in HeLa cells, no such apoptosis-inducing ability of H2-a was observed. Among the radical scavengers, histidine significantly inhibited the cytotoxic activity of H2-a, suggesting the involvement of singlet oxygen in the cytotoxicity. These results suggest that the cytotoxic mechanism of H2-a is necrotic rather than apoptosis differing from PME, even though these are structurally quite similar to each other. The relatively high affinity of H2-a to the plasma membrane might result in the potent and quick cytotoxicity without induction of apoptotic signal transduction.",

In spite of having the same M w of the NPTX-2, previously described in the venom of the Joro spider Nephila clavata , neither toxins are isomers.

        "abstract": "The complete amino acid sequence of two forms of crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) from the X-organ sinus gland complex of crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) has been determined. There are two variants of P. clarkii CHH (Prc-CHH), I and II, which can be separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Each variant was oxidized by performic acid and then cleaved with lysyl endopeptidase. Intact hormone was also digested with trypsin and endoproteinase Asp-N, successively. The resulting fragments were separated by RP-HPLC and subjected to sequence analyses by a gas-phase sequencer and tandem mass spectrometry. Both variants contain 72 amino acid residues with three disulfide linkages, at positions 7-43, 23-39, and 26-52, and differ from each other by the D/L epimerization of phenylalanine at position 3; Prc-CHH-II contains D-amino acid. Injections of Prc-CHH-I and Prc-CHH-II at a dose of 12.5 pmol resulted in significant increase of hemolymph glucose levels in the crayfish. The hormones are also active in repressing ecdysteroid synthesis at concentrations of 250 mM (Prc-CHH-I) and 25 nM (Prc-CHH-II) in Y-organ culture. These results may indicate that the stereoinversion in the CHH molecule leads to an important alternation in hormonal functions during crustacean development.",

We have developed a new highly sensitive analytical method to detect and characterize structures of those neurotoxins stored in a single venom gland using micro bore column high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-continuous flow FRIT fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (HPLC-FAB/MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) array detection system. The high-energy collision induced dissociation (CID) spectra of sodium cationized spider toxins produced very strong structurally informative product ions which afforded the location of nitrogen atoms and the connectivity of methylene units within the polyamines. This methodology permitted detection of 40 amino acid containing acylpolyamines in the venom of Nephilengys borbonica from which structures of only five compounds were previously known.",

Meromycolic acids were prepared from each methyl mycolate fraction by pyrolysis, followed by silver oxide oxidation, and analysed by high-energy collision-induced dissociation/fast atom bombardment MS to reveal the exact locations of the functional groups within the meromycolate chain. The locations of cis and trans double bonds, cis and trans cyclopropane rings, methoxy and keto groups, and methyl branches within the meromycolate chain were determined from their characteristic fragment ion profiles, and the structures of the meromycolic acids, including those with three functional groups extracted from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra, Mycobacterium bovis BCG and Mycobacterium microti, were established. Meromycolic acids with one cis double bond were structurally closely related to those with one cis cyclopropane ring, whereas the meromycolic acids with one trans cyclopropane ring were closely related to the corresponding meromycolic acids with one cis cyclopropane ring. A close relationship between methoxy- and keto-meromycolic acids was also implied. The relationship between the meromycolic acids with a trans double bond and the other meromycolic acids was not clearly revealed, and they did not appear to be immediate substrates for trans cyclopropanation.",

        "abstract": "We have previously found that the methanol extract prepared from Heterocapsa circularisquama, a harmful red rid dinoflagellate, showed light-dependent hemolytic activity toward rabbit erythrocytes. Interestingly, the cytotoxicity of the extract against HeLa cells was also strictly light-dependent, and no significant toxic effect was observed even at very high concentration in the dark. In this study, the hemolytic agents present in the extract were purified by several chromatographic procedures. Final HPLC analysis revealed that there are at least two hemolytic toxins with different retention times (H2-a and H3-a), which have similar absorption spectra. Although H3-a fraction was contaminated by a trace amount of H2-a, H2-a fraction gave a single peak on a three-dimensional chromatogram. The results of fast atom bombardment (FAB)-mass spectrometry (MS) and electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight (ESI Q-TOF) mass spectrometry analyses suggested that the molecular weight of H2-a was 566. Since nuclear magnetic resonance analysis indicated the presence of a pyrrole ring in H2-a molecule, H2-a may be a porphyrin derivative with similar structure of pyropheophorbide a methyl ester, a well-known photosensitizing hemolytic compound. However, some structural and physicochemical differences were observed between H2-a and pyropheophorbide a methyl ester. Since H2-a showed potent photosensitizing cytotoxicity toward HeLa cells in a concentration-dependent manner as well as hemolytic activity, H2-a may be a novel porphyrin derivative with photosensitizing hemolytic cytotoxicity.",

The NMR data obtained for NPTX-6, NPTX-687 and hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid which was released by acid hydrolysis of Nephila clavata crude venom extracts proved that the lipophilic head is the 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid. Various hydroxyindole-3-acetyl polyamines were found in N. Clavata venom and characterized by mass spectrometry. As a result, type-E, a new class of generalized acylpolyamine structure was proposed in addition to the previously reported polyamine backbones type-A to -D.",

The steroidogenic end product of the symbiotes was found to depend on the environmental conditions, i.e., although trienol6 was produced under symbiotic conditions, ergosterol4 was formed in aerobic culture. When the normal diet was replaced by a steroiddeficient artificial one, the ratio of 24-methylenecholesterol5 to total insect sterols was significantly increased. The above study offers further corroborating evidence for our assumption that the host insects require 24-methylenecholesterol5 as an alternate source for cholesterol1 under certain environmental conditions. In our previous biotransformation experiments, 24methylenecholesterol5 was shown to be an immediate precursor of cholesterol1. However, the complexity of the insects' vital functions hindered all subsequent attempted transformations into cholesterol1 of sitosterol2, trienol6, and ergosterol4, under injection conditions.",

        "abstract": "Gingival epithelial cells first encounter periodontopathogenic bacteria and their metabolic products to produce inflammatory cytokines. Gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) is thought to play a critical role in cellular coordination in tissue homeostasis. Gap junctions are structured by connexins (CXs). GJIC response of gingival epithelial cells to the bacteria may be involved in the initiation of periodontal disease. Irsogladine maleate (IM) is known to enhance GJIC through cAMP. In the present study, we examined an effect of IM on GJIC response and on interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels in human gingival epithelial cells (HGEC) exposed to a periodontopathogenic bacterium, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and its outer membrane protein (OMP) 29 in order to test the hypothesis that IM has the ability to modulate GJIC and inflammatory responses of gingival epithelial cells to periodontopathogenic bacteria. IM countered the OMP29-induced reduction of GJIC, CX43 levels and cAMP levels in HGEC. The simultaneous addition of OMP29 and dibutyryl cAMP also abrogated the repression of GJIC by OMP29. Furthermore, IM obviated the increase in IL-8 levels in HGEC stimulated by whole live A. actinomycetemcomitans and by OMP29. These findings suggest that IM counters the OMP29-induced GJIC reduction in HGEC through cAMP. IM may eliminate initial perturbation of gingival epithelial cells by regulating responses of GJIC and IL-8 to periodontopathogenic bacterial exposure.",

Therefore, a better understanding of the action of SPARC on periodontal ligament cells could help to elucidate remodelling and repair mechanisms in periodontal tissue. In the present study, we examined the effects of human platelet-derived SPARC (hp-SPARC) on the expressions of SPARC and osteoprotegerin/osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor (OPG/OCIF), alkaline phosphatase (ALPase) activity, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) production and DNA synthesis in cultures of human periodontal ligament (HPL) cells.HPL cells at the sixth passage were exposed to hp-SPARC. The expression of OPG/OCIF and SPARC mRNAs was examined by Northern blot analysis. The protein levels for OPG/OCIF and MMP-2 were determined by Western blot analysis. ALPase activity was measured by the method of Bessey et al. DNA synthesis was estimated by incorporation of [3H] thymidine.Hp-SPARC enhanced OPG/OCIF synthesis at the protein and mRNA levels. Hp-SPARC also enhanced DNA and MMP-2 synthesis dose-dependently, but had little effect on ALPase activity and SPARC mRNA expression.SPARC may play a role in remodelling and repair of periodontal tissue by promoting proliferation and MMP-2 production. It may also regulate osteoclast formation through OPG/OCIF in periodontal ligament cells.",

In this study, mRNA expressions of hard tissue-related proteins, calcification and proliferation are examined in cultures of human pulp (HP) cells. Nerve growth factor (NGF), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin (NT)-3 and NT-4/5 increased the mRNA levels of dentin sialophsphoprotein, alkaline phosphatase, osteopontin, type I collagen and bone morphogenetic protein-2 and mineral deposition in cultures of HP cells. The increased levels and manners varied, depending on the concentrations of NTs and hard-tissue related protein tested. On the other hand, only NGF significantly stimulated DNA synthesis in cultures of HP cells. These findings suggest that NTs characteristically regulate hard-tissue related protein expression, calcification and proliferation in pulp cells. NTs may accelerate pulp cell differentiation.",

However, it remains unknown how they act on proliferation and differentiation of periodontal ligament cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of several growth factors and cytokines on the synthesis of DNA, alkaline phosphatase (ALPase), fibronectin, and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) in human periodontal ligament (HPL) cells. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) increased the synthesis of DNA, fibronectin and SPARC, whereas it decreased ALPase activity. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) decreased SPARC and ALPase levels, whereas these peptides increased DNA synthesis and did not affect fibronectin synthesis. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) up-regulated the synthesis of DNA and fibronectin and inhibited SPARC and ALPase levels. Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) decreased the synthesis of DNA, ALPase, fibronectin and SPARC. These findings demonstrate that TGF-beta, bFGF, EGF, PDGF, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta have characteristically different patterns of action on DNA, SPARC, fibronectin and ALPase synthesis by HPL cells. The differences in regulation of function of periodontal ligament cells by these peptides may be involved in the regeneration and repair of periodontal tissue.",

However, little is known about the mechanism by which calcium hydroxide works. The calcium ion (Ca2+) is an important regulator of cell functions. In this study, we examined the effect of extracellular Ca2+ on gene expression of bone-related proteins in human cultured pulp cells in serum-free conditions. A Ca2+ level elevated by 0.7 mM induced an increase in mRNA expression of osteopontin and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2. However, mRNA levels of BMP-4 and alkaline phosphatase decreased under the elevated Ca2+ culture condition. The same concentration of additional magnesium ions had little effect on expressions of the examined bone-related protein mRNAs. These findings suggest that Ca2+ in Ca(OH)2 specifically modulates osteopontin and BMP-2 levels during calcification in pulp.",

In this study, we focused on the level of CD38 expression between LAgP and normal subjects and examined the involvement of CD38 in abnormal neutrophil chemotaxis of LAgP patients.Neutrophils from 12 normal subjects and 12 LAgP patients were isolated from peripheral venous blood. Membrane associated proteins were extracted from cells with or without N-formylmethionine leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) stimulation. CD38 expression was measured using Western blotting. Band density was measured using an imaging densitometer.There was no statistical difference between normal subjects and LAgP patients in resting CD38 expression (basal level). However, the fMLP-stimulated neutrophils exhibited a significant decrease of CD38 expression in LAgP subjects compared to normal subjects. The decrease of CD38 was positively correlated with the defect in chemotactic migration to fMLP.These data suggest that the lower expression of CD38 in neutrophils may be related to altered neutrophil function in LAgP.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to differentiate roles of several growth factors and cytokines in proliferation and differentiation of pulp cells during development and repair. In human pulp cell cultures, laminin and type I collagen levels per cell remained almost constant during the whole culture period (22 days). On the other hand, secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC/osteonectin) and alkaline phosphatase (ALPase) levels markedly increased after the cultures reached confluence. Laminin and type I collagen, as well as fibronectin, stimulated the spreading of pulp cells within 1 h. Adding transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) decreased laminin and ALPase levels, whereas it increased SPARC and fibronectin levels 3- to 10-fold. Western and Northern blots showed that TGF-beta enhanced SPARC synthesis at the protein and mRNA levels. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) decreased type I collagen, laminin, SPARC, and ALPase levels without changing the fibronectin level. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) selectively decreased laminin, SPARC, and ALPase levels. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) also decreased SPARC and ALPase levels. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) decreased type I collagen and laminin levels, and abolished SPARC and ALPase syntheses. Of these peptides, bFGF and PDGF showed the greatest stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. TGF-beta, EGF, and TNF-alpha had less effect on DNA synthesis, whereas IL-1beta inhibited DNA synthesis. These findings demonstrated that TGF-beta, bFGF, EGF, PDGF, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta have characteristically different patterns of actions on DNA, laminin, type I collagen, fibronectin, ALPase, and SPARC syntheses by pulp cells.",

        "abstract": "Secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) has been suggested to play an important role in wound repair and mineralization. Osteoprotegerin/osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor (OPG/OCIF) is a secreted protein that inhibits the maturation, activity and survival of osteoclasts. An examination of the changes in expression of these proteins as well as their proliferative ability according to ageing in cultured cells may elucidate characteristic changes in periodontal tissues induced by ageing. In the present study, proliferative ability and the expression of SPARC and OPG/OCIF were compared between cultures of human periodontal ligament (HPL) cells obtained from young and senior donors (in vivo cellular ageing) as well as in cultures of HPL cells at early and late passages (in vitro cellular ageing). Cumulative population doubling levels and cell population doubling time of HPL cells from young donors were greater and shorter, respectively, than those of HPL cells from senior donors. Levels of SPARC mRNA in HPL cells increased with cellular ageing in vivo. No change in the levels of OPG/OCIF mRNA in HPL cells with cellular ageing in vivo was observed. The changes in proliferative ability and the mRNA levels of SPARC and OPG/OCIF with cellular ageing in vitro were similar to those with ageing in vivo. This study demonstrated for the first time a relationship between in vivo and in vitro cellular ageing in the functional changes in HPL cells. These findings suggest that the impairment of periodontal ligament repair with ageing is due to the decrease in proliferative ability in HPL cells with ageing. Furthermore, the increase in SPARC with ageing may be related to changes in metabolism of periodontal ligament that occur with ageing.",

In this study, we examined the effect of LL37 on the migration of human pulp (HP) cells.HP cells at the sixth passage were exposed to LL37. The migration of HP cells was assessed by a wound-healing assay. The phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was analyzed by immunoblotting.LL37 as well as heparin binding (HB)-EGF, which is an agonist of EGFR, induced HP cell migration. LL37 increased the level of phosphorylated EGFR. An anti-EGFR antibody, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and a JNK inhibitor abolished the migration induced by both LL37 and HB-EGF. Furthermore, the two peptides increased the levels of phosphorylated JNK.LL37 activates EGFR and JNK to induce HP cell migration, and it may contribute to enhancing the regeneration of pulp-dentin complexes.",

        "abstract": "The anti-inflammatory effects of low-power laser irradiation have previously been reported. However, how the laser irradiation regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines remains unknown. In the present study, to elucidate the mechanism behind the anti-inflammatory effect, we examined the effects of low-power neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminium-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser irradiation on interleukin (IL)-6 expression in human pulp (HP) cells stimulated by peptidoglycan (PGN) and focused on intracellular signaling pathways. Low-power Nd:YAG laser irradiation obviated the PGN-induced increase in IL-6 levels in HP cells. A p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, SB203580, also inhibited the increase in IL-6 messenger RNA levels. PGN stimulated the activity of phosphorylated p38 in HP cells. Low-power laser irradiation inhibited the activity. Thus, suppression of the phosphorylated p38 activity by low-power laser irradiation in HP cells culminates in inhibition of the increase in IL-6 induced by PGN, suggesting that low-power laser irradiation regulates intracellular signaling molecule activities to exert its anti-inflammatory effect.",

        "abstract": "Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a novel tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily that inhibits osteoclast differentiation, activity, and survival. Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) increases OPG expression. IL-1beta also increases prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production and stimulates bone resorption. In the present study, we examined the involvement of PGE(2) in IL-1beta-induced increases in OPG levels in human periodontal ligament cells (HPL cells) in an effort to clarify apparently conflicting IL-1beta actions on bone resorption and understand IL-1beta-induced increases in secretion of OPG and PGE(2) in HPL cells. 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole, a mRNA synthesis inhibitor, partly inhibited the increase in OPG mRNA levels induced by IL-1beta. Cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, enhanced the stimulatory effect of IL-1beta. Etodolac, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, suppressed the increase in PGE(2) levels. Furthermore, etodolac reinforced the promotion of OPG expression by IL-1beta at the mRNA and protein levels. PGE(2) added to cultures of HPL cells decreased OPG mRNA levels in a dose- and time- dependent manner. These findings suggest that the increase in OPG levels induced by IL-1beta in HPL cells is suppressed through PGE(2) synthesized de novo.",

        "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) activates its receptor TrkB, and promotes neuronal survival, differentiation, and synaptic functions. Furthermore, we have revealed that BDNF can also regulate cementoblast differentiation and cellular survival via TrkB-ERK/Akt signaling cascade, which, in turn, results in the induction of periodontal tissue regeneration. Recently, using in silico screening with a BDNF loop-domain pharmacophore, a small molecule BDNF mimetic, called LM22A-4 that can facilitate TrkB signaling in hippocampal neurons to prevent cell death, was identified. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of LM22A-4 on cementoblast differentiation and its molecular mechanism. LM22A-4 and BDNF stimulation was found to enhance OPN, ALPase, and OC mRNA expression in immortalized human cementoblast-like (HCEM) cells, indicating cementoblast differentiation. In addition, similar to this result, both LM22A-4 and BDNF treatment facilitated TrkB phosphorylation and TrkB binding to adaptor proteins, such as Shc, GRB2, and SOS1, indicating TrkB activation. Importantly, the downstream target ERK and Akt was also phosphorylated by LM22A-4 and BDNF stimulation. Moreover, BDNF mimetic stimulation transactivated ERK from the cytoplasm into the nuclei in HCEM cells. It is noteworthy that a tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor, K252a, an MEK-ERK inhibitor (U0126), and a PI3Kinase-Akt inhibitor (LY294002) remarkably attenuated TrkB, ERK, and Akt phosphorylation as well as increase of OPN mRNA expression in the HCEM cells, respectively. These findings suggest that the small molecule BDNF mimetic LM22A-4 regulates cementoblast differentiation via the TrkB-ERK/Akt signaling cascade. Therefore, this small compound may lead to the development of a novel therapeutic approach for periodontal tissue regeneration.",

A combination of \u03b2-TCP with MSC/Col was also prepared (MSC/Col/TCP). MSC/Col/TCP or MSC/Col was transplanted into experimental periodontal Class III furcation defects that had been exposed to inflammation in beagle dogs. Periodontal tissue regeneration was evaluated by histologic and morphometric analyses at 4 and 8 weeks after transplantation.MSC/Col and MSC/Col/TCP enhanced periodontal tissue regeneration compared to Col and TCP/Col according to hematoxylin and eosin staining. The percentage of new cementum length in the MSC/Col/TCP group was not significantly different from that in the MSC/Col group at 4 and 8 weeks. On the other hand, the percentage of new bone area in the MSC/Col/TCP group was much higher than that in the MSC/TCP group at 4 weeks. However, at 8 weeks, no significant difference in new bone area was found between the two groups. In the MSC/Col/TCP group, \u03b2-TCP was surrounded by newly formed bone. Multinucleated cells, which were positive for osteopontin and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, were present in the interconnected macropores of \u03b2-TCP.These findings suggest that \u03b2-TCP is applicable as a scaffold for BMMSCs transplantation and helps augment alveolar bone without impairing regeneration of cementum.",

We examined the effect of FN on SPARC expression by TGF-beta(1) in cultures of human periodontal ligament cells (HPL cells). TGF-beta(1) increased the SPARC and SPARC mRNA levels in HPL cells. Extracellular matrix (ECM) produced by HPL cells in the presence of TGF-beta(1) also increased the SPARC levels. Contents of FN and type I collagen in the ECM were increased by TGF-beta(1). HPL cells cultured on FN-coated plates secreted more SPARC than those on non-coated plates. However, type I collagen had little effect on SPARC levels. The addition of anti-alpha5 antibody to the cultures abolished the increase in SPARC mRNA expression by TGF-beta(1). This study demonstrated that FN may be partly involved in the increase in SPARC expression by TGF-beta(1) in HPL cells.",

Basic studies have revealed that transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) into periodontal defects promotes regeneration of periodontal tissue. We have developed a novel method for periodontal therapy using MSC. Human bone marrow cells are obtained from the iliac crest and expanded in vitro at Cell and Tissue Engineering Center in Hiroshima University Hospital. MSC are, then, isolated and mixed with Atelocollagen at final concentrations of 2 x 10(7) cells/mL. These MSC in Atelocollagen are transplanted into periodontal osseous defects at the periodontal surgery. The results in all seven patients who received the own MSC transplantation have shown good clinical course. Further basic studies and the continuous clinical trial are needed to prove the effectiveness of the clinical application.",

        "abstract": "The transplantation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to damaged tissue has attracted attention in scientific and medical fields as an effective regenerative therapy. Nevertheless, additional studies are required to develop an MSC transplant method for bone regeneration because the use of an artificial scaffold restricts the number of transplanted cells and their function. Furthermore, regulating the degree of cell differentiation in vitro is desirable for a more effective regenerative therapy. To address these unresolved issues, with the use of a self-produced extracellular matrix (ECM), we developed clumps of an MSC/ECM complex (C-MSCs).MSCs isolated from rat femur were cultured in growth medium supplemented with 50 \u03bcg/mL of ascorbic acid for 7 days. To obtain C-MSCs, confluent cells were scratched with the use of a micropipette tip to roll up the cellular sheet, which consisted of ECM produced by the MSCs. The biological properties of C-MSCs were assessed in vitro and their bone regenerative activity was tested by use of a rat calvarial defect model.Immunofluorescent confocal microscopic analysis revealed that type I collagen formed C-MSCs. Osteopontin messenger RNA expression and amount of calcium content were higher in C-MSCs cultured in osteo-inductive medium than those of untreated C-MSCs. The transplantation of osteogenic-differentiated C-MSCs led to rapid bone regeneration in the rat calvarial defect model.These results suggest that the use of C-MSCs refined by self-produced ECM, which contain no artificial scaffold and can be processed in vitro, may represent a novel tissue engineering therapy.",

        "abstract": "Calprotectin, an inflammation-related protein, is present in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and the determination of calprotectin is useful for diagnosing periodontal diseases. We have recently developed a novel immunochromatographic (IC) chip system (SI-101402) to determine calprotectin levels in GCF. In the present study, the usefulness of this diagnostic system was investigated in patients with periodontal diseases.Thirty-six patients with periodontal diseases participated in this clinical test at multiple centers. Periodontitis sites (n=118) and non-periodontitis (healthy) sites (n=120) were selected after periodontal examination. GCF collection and periodontal examination were performed at baseline, after supragingival and subgingival scaling and root planing. Calprotectin amount in GCF was determined using a novel IC chip system and evaluated as a visual score and an IC reader value. The correlation between GCF calprotectin levels, clinical indicators and changes in calprotectin levels by periodontal treatments were investigated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of IC reader value for GCF calprotectin was performed to predict periodontal diseases.The visual score of GCF calprotectin was highly correlated the IC reader value. IC reader values of GCF calprotectin in periodontitis group were higher than those of healthy group at three dental examination stages and they significantly decreased with periodontal treatments. Visual scores and IC reader values of GCF calprotectin were correlated to the levels of clinical indicators. ROC analysis for GCF calprotectin showed an optimal cutoff value to predict periodontal diseases.Determination of GCF calprotectin using a novel IC chip system is useful for diagnosis of periodontal diseases.",

        "abstract": "Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) is a tumor suppressor of cancer and appears to be an important component of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-ss)-induced tumor suppression pathway. Surprisingly, we found that RUNX3 expression level in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tissues, which is one of the most common types of human cancer, was higher than that in normal tissues by a previously published microarray dataset in our preliminary study. Therefore, here we examined the oncogenic role of RUNX3 in HNSCC.Frequent RUNX3 expression and its correlation with malignant behavior were observed in HNSCC. Ectopic RUNX3 overexpression promoted cell growth and inhibited serum starvation-induced apoptosis and chemotherapeutic drug induced apoptosis in HNSCC cells. These findings were confirmed by RUNX3 knockdown. Moreover, RUNX3 overexpression enhanced tumorsphere formation. RUNX3 expression level was well correlated with the methylation status in HNSCC cells. Moreover, RUNX3 expression was low due to the methylation of its promoter in normal oral epithelial cells.Our findings suggest that i) RUNX3 has an oncogenic role in HNSCC, ii) RUNX3 expression observed in HNSCC may be caused in part by demethylation during cancer development, and iii) RUNX3 expression can be a useful marker for predicting malignant behavior and the effect of chemotherapeutic drugs in HNSCC.",

        "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), for which bovine collagen-derived atelocollagen is used as a scaffold, enhances periodontal tissue regeneration. However, a scaffold that does not contain unknown ingredients is preferable. Since the synthesized high-molecular-weight (HMW)-hyaluronic acid (HA) is safe and inexpensive, we evaluated the efficacy of HMW-HA as a BDNF scaffold. CD44, a major receptor of HA, was expressed in cultures of human periodontal ligament cells, and HMW-HA promoted the adhesion and proliferation of human periodontal ligament cells, although it did not influence the mRNA expression of bone (cementum)-related proteins. The in vitro release kinetics of BDNF from HMW-HA showed that BDNF release was sustained for 14 days. Subsequently, we examined the effect of BDNF/HMW-HA complex on periodontal tissue regeneration in dogs. A greater volume of newly formed alveolar bone and a longer newly formed cementum were observed in the BDNF/HMW-HA group than in the HMW-HA group, suggesting that HMW-HA assists the regenerative capacity of BDNF, although HMW-HA itself does not enhance periodontal tissue regeneration. Neither the poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) group nor the BDNF/poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) group enhanced periodontal tissue regeneration. In conclusion, HMW-HA is an adequate scaffold for the clinical application of BDNF.",

        "abstract": "IL-32 was recently found to be elevated in the tissue of rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by polymicrobial infections that result in soft tissue destruction and alveolar bone loss. Although IL-32 is also thought to be associated with periodontal disease, its expression and possible role in periodontal tissue remain unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the expression patterns of IL-32 in healthy and periodontally diseased gingival tissue. The expression of IL-32 in cultured human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) as well as effects of autocrine IL-32 on IL-8 production from HGF were also examined.Periodontal tissue was collected from both healthy volunteers and periodontitis patients, and immunofluorescent staining was performed in order to determine the production of IL-32. Using real-time PCR and ELISA, mRNA expression and protein production of IL-32 in HGF, stimulated by Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), were also investigated.Contrary to our expectation, the production of IL-32 in the periodontitis patients was significantly lower than in the healthy volunteers. According to immunofluorescent microscopy, positive staining for IL-32 was detected in prickle and basal cell layers in the epithelium as well as fibroblastic cells in connective tissue. Addition of fixed Pgin vitro was found to suppress the otherwise constitutive expression of IL-32 mRNA and protein in HGF. However, recombinant IL-32 in vitro inhibited the expression of IL-8 mRNA by HGF stimulated with Pg. Interestingly, anti-IL-32 neutralizing antibody upregulated the IL-8 mRNA expression in non-stimulated HGF, indicating that constitutive expression of IL-32 in HGF suppressed IL-8 mRNA expression in the absence of bacterial stimulation.These results indicate that IL-32 is constitutively produced by HGF which can be suppressed by Pg and may play a role in the downregulation of inflammatory responses, such as IL-8 production, in periodontal tissue.",

        "title": "Distinction Between Cell Proliferation and Apoptosis Signals Regulated by Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor in Human Periodontal Ligament Cells and Gingival Epithelial Cells.",
        "abstract": "Previously, we reported that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) enhances periodontal tissue regeneration by inducing periodontal ligament cell proliferation in vivo. In addition, the down growth of gingival epithelial cells, which comprises a major obstacle to the regeneration was not observed. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of BDNF on cell proliferation and apoptosis in human periodontal ligament cells (HPL cells) and human gingival epithelial cells (OBA9 cells) and to explore the molecular mechanism in vitro. HPL cells dominantly expressed a BDNF receptor, TrkB, and BDNF increased cell proliferation and ERK phosphorylation. However, its proliferative effect was diminished by a MEK1/2 inhibitor (U0126) and TrkB siRNA transfection. Otherwise, OBA9 cells showed a higher expression level of p75, which is a pan-neurotrophin receptor, than that of HPL cells. BDNF facilitated not cell proliferation but cell apoptosis and JNK phosphorylation in OBA9 cells. A JNK inhibitor (SP600125) and p75 siRNA transfection attenuated the BDNF-induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, OBA9 cells pretreated with SP600125 or p75 siRNA showed cell proliferation by BDNF stimulation, though it was reduced by U0126 and TrkB siRNA. Interestingly, overexpression of p75 in HPL cells up-regulated cell apoptosis and JNK phosphorylation by BDNF treatment. These results indicated that TrkB-ERK signaling regulates BDNF-induced cell proliferation, whereas p75-JNK signaling plays roles in cell apoptotic and cytostatic effect of BDNF. Overall, BDNF activates periodontal ligament cells proliferation and inhibits the gingival epithelial cells growth via the distinct pathway. This article is protected by copyright.

        "abstract": "Our previous report has shown that Irsogladine maleate (IM) counters and obviates the reduction in gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) and the increase in IL-8 levels, respectively, induced by outer membrane protein 29 from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A. actinomycetemcomitans) in cultured human gingival epithelial cells (HGEC). In addition, IM suppresses the increase in the secretion of IL-8 caused by whole live A. actinomycetemcomitans. These findings implicate the modulation of IL-8 levels by IM in abolishment of the reduction of GJIC in HGEC. Tight junctions are also responsible for cell-cell communication. Zonula occludens protein-1 (ZO-1) is a major tight junction protein. To investigate the regulatory mechanism of intercellular communication mediated by IM, in the present study, we focused on the involvement of IL-8 in A. actinomycetemcomitans-induced change in GJIC and ZO-1 expression in HGEC. IM countered the A. actinomycetemcomitans-induced reduction in levels of Connexin (CX) 43, suggesting that it could abolish the A. actinomycetemcomitans-induced reduction in GJIC in HGEC. CXCR-1 is a receptor of IL-8. The simultaneous addition of A. actinomycetemcomitans and anti-CXCR-1 antibody also abrogated the repression of GJIC and CX43 expression by A. actinomycetemcomitans in HGEC, although the anti-CXCR-1 antibody was less effective than IM. IM inhibited the IL-8-induced reduction in CX43 levels and GJIC in HGEC. IM countered the A. actinomycetemcomitans-induced reduction in the expression of ZO-1, although anti-CXCR-1 antibody did not influence the decrease in ZO-1 mRNA levels caused by A. actinomycetemcomitans. Furthermore, IL-8 had little effect on the mRNA levels of ZO-1. These findings suggest that IL-8 mediates the A. actinomycetemcomitans-induced reduction of GJIC and CX43 expression in HGEC. The regulation of IL-8 levels by IM in HGEC is partially involved in abrogation of the reduction of GJIC and CX43 expression by A. actinomycetemcomitans. Furthermore, the regulatory effect of IM on the expression of CX43 and ZO-1 is different.",

        "abstract": "Our previous studies have shown that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) enhances bone/cementum-related protein gene expression through the TrkB-c-Raf-ERK1/2-Elk-1 signaling pathway in cementoblasts, which play a critical role in the establishment of a functional periodontal ligament. To clarify how BDNF regulates survival in cementoblasts, we examined its effects on cell death induced by serum starvation in immortalized human cementoblast-like (HCEM) cells. BDNF inhibited the death of HCEM cells. Small-interfering RNA (siRNA) for TRKB, a high affinity receptor for BDNF, and for Bcl-2, countered the BDNF-induced decrease in dead cell number. In addition, LY294002, a PI3-kinase inhibitor; SH-6, an Akt inhibitor; and PDTC, a nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) inhibitor, but not PD98059, an ERK1/2 inhibitor, abolished the protective effect of BDNF against cell death. BDNF enhanced phosphorylated Akt levels, NF-kappaB activity in the nucleus, Bcl-2 mRNA levels, and mitochondrial membrane potential. The blocking of BDNF's actions by treatment with siRNA in all cases for TRKB and Bcl-2, LY294002, SH-6, and PDTC suppressed the enhancement. These findings provide the first evidence that a TrkB-PI3-kinase-Akt-NF-kappaB-Bcl-2 signaling pathway triggered by BDNF and the subsequent protective effect of BDNF on mitochondrial membrane potential are required to rescue HCEM cells from serum starvation-induced cell death. Furthermore, the survival and increased expression of bone/cementum-related proteins induced by BDNF in HCEM cells occur through different signaling pathways.",

        "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes the regeneration of periodontal tissue. Since angiogenesis is important for tissue regeneration, investigating effect of BDNF on endothelial cell function may help to reveal its mechanism, whereby, BDNF promotes periodontal tissue regeneration. In this study, we examined the influence of BDNF on migration in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs), focusing on the effects on extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), integrin \u03b1(V)\u03b2(3), and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). The migration of endothelial cells was assessed with a modified Boyden chamber and a wound healing assay. The expression of integrin \u03b1(V)\u03b2(3) and the phosphorylation of ERK and FAK were analyzed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. BDNF (25 ng/ml) induced cell migration. PD98059, an ERK inhibitor, K252a, a specific inhibitor for TrkB, a high affinity receptor of BDNF, and an anti-integrin \u03b1(V)\u03b2(3) antibody suppressed the BDNF-induced migration. BDNF increased the levels of integrin \u03b1(V)\u03b2(3) and phosphorylated ERK1/2 and FAK. The ERK inhibitor and TrkB inhibitor also reduced levels of integrin \u03b1(V)\u03b2(3) and phosphorylated FAK. We propose that BDNF stimulates endothelial cell migration by a process involving TrkB/ERK/integrin \u03b1(V)\u03b2(3)/FAK, and this may help to enhance the regeneration of periodontal tissue.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we examined the mechanism by which CD38 cleavage is regulated through the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases after stimulation by fMLP and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in neutrophils. Both fMLP and IL-8 increased chemotaxis and decreased CD38 protein in neutrophils, but did not change CD38 mRNA levels. Both fMLP and IL-8 increased CD38 in supernatants, which was inhibitable with PMSF. fMLP stimulation resulted in phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase and p42/44 MAP kinase (ERK). SB20358, a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, down-regulated neutrophil chemotaxis. Conversely, PD98059, an ERK inhibitor, did not influence chemotaxis to either agonist. The addition of SB20358 blocked the decrease of CD38 on neutrophils and the increase in supernatants induced by fMLP or IL-8, whereas PD98059 did not. These findings suggest that CD38-mediated chemotaxis to fMLP or IL-8 is characterized by proteolytic cleavage of CD38 and signaling through p38 MAP kinase. Activation of the protease for cleavage appears to be a postreceptor event that is dependent on p38 MAP kinase signaling.",

        "abstract": "Irsogladine maleate (IM) counters Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-induced reduction of the gap junction intercellular communication and the expression of zonula occludens-1, which is a major tight junction structured protein, in cultured human gingival epithelial cells (HGEC). In addition, IM obviates the A. actinomycetemcomitans-induced increase in interleukin (IL)-8 levels in HGEC. Thus, by regulating the intercellular junctional complex and chemokine secretion in HGEC, IM may be useful to prevent periodontal disease. To clarify the effects and regulatory mechanism of IM in vivo and in vitro, we examined the expression of E-cadherin and neutrophil chemotaxis induced by A. actinomycetemcomitans under IM pretreatment. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that A. actinomycetemcomitans application to the gingival sulcus decreased the number of cells positive for E-cadherin and increased those positive for cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-2alpha (CINC-2alpha) in rat gingival epithelium. However, in IM-pretreated rats, A. actinomycetemcomitans application had little effect on CINC-2alpha and E-cadherin in gingival epithelium. In cultured HGEC, real-time PCR and Western blotting showed that IM and the ERK inhibitor PD98059 abolished the A. actinomycetemcomitans-induced increase in CXCL-1 and IL-8 in HGEC. On the other hand, IM, PD98059, and the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 recovered the decrease in E-cadherin expression. In addition, conditioned medium from A. actinomycetemcomitans-stimulated HGEC enhanced human neutrophil chemotaxis, compared to that from un-stimulated HGEC or that from A. actinomycetemcomitans-stimulated HGEC under IM pretreatment. Furthermore, IM down-regulated the p38 MAP kinase and ERK phosphorylations induced by A. actinomycetemcomitans. In conclusion, IM may control A. actinomycetemcomitans-induced gingival inflammation by regulating neutrophil migration and E-cadherin expression in gingival epithelium.",

We hypothesized that LL37 can facilitate successful bone regeneration. To prove this hypothesis, the present study tested the effects of LL37 on bone formation in a rat calvarial bone defect model. Synthesized LL37 markedly induced newly formed bone. Interestingly, morphologically fibroblastic cells were observed in animals treated with LL37 on day 7, the early stage of tissue regeneration, which were positive for STRO-1, a marker of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and accumulated in the bone defect area where cells positive for CD34, a marker of endothelial cells, were also localized. In addition, LL37 stimulated tube formation by endothelial cells and the proliferation of MSCs in vitro. These findings demonstrated for the first time that LL37 can regulate angiogenesis and the recruitment of stem cells to promote bone regeneration.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Differential miRNA expression in innate and acquired immunity has been shown to regulate immune cell development and function. miRNA expression has been demonstrated to affect pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. As such, this study explores the role of miRNA in the context of pathophysiology of destructive periodontitis. Specifically, this investigation profiles the differentially expressed miRNA of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg)-stimulated human gingival epithelial cells (HGECs).The specific miRNAs differentially expressed in Pg-stimulated OBA-9, immortalized HGECs, were analyzed using microarray. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting were performed to confirm the level of miRNA expression and determine target production of miRNA in OBA-9. The production of interleukin (IL)-8 was measured to determine the bioactivity of target protein regulated by miRNA.miR-584, which targets lactoferrin receptor (LfR), was 3.39-fold upregulated by Pg stimulation. This upregulation of miR-584 was confirmed by real-time PCR. Pg stimulation resulted in the suppression of LfR at mRNA and protein levels. The transfection of the miR inhibitor for miR-584 in OBA-9 recovered Pg-induced suppression of LfR. The addition of human lactoferrin (hLf) had a suppressive effect on IL-8 production in Pg-stimulated OBA-9. However, hLf also decreased IL-8 production strongly in Pg-stimulated OBA-9 in the presence of the miR inhibitor for miR-584.These findings suggest that the upregulation of miR-584 by Pg in OBA-9 inhibits the anti-inflammatory effects of hLf via the suppression of LfR.",

        "abstract": "RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate mRNA stability by binding to the 3'-UTR region of mRNA. Human antigen-R (HuR), one of the RBPs, is involved in the progression of diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, some inflammatory diseases. Interleukin (IL)-6 is a major inflammatory cytokine regulated by HuR binding to mRNA. Periodontal disease (PD) is also an inflammatory disease caused by elevations in IL-6 following an infection by periodontopathognic bacteria. The involvement of HuR in the progression of PD was assessed using in vitro and in vivo experiment. Immunohistochemistry of inflamed periodontal tissue showed the strong staining of HuR in the epithelium and connective tissue. HuR mRNA and protein level was increased following a stimulation with Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), one of the periodontopathogenic bacteria, LPS derived from Pg (PgLPS), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 in OBA-9, an immortalized human gingival epithelial cell. The luciferase activity of 3'-UTR of IL-6 mRNA was increased by TNF-\u03b1, Pg, and PgLPS in OBA-9. Luciferase activity was also increased in HuR-overexpressing OBA-9 following a bacterial stimulation. The down-regulation of HuR by siRNA resulted in a decrease in the mRNA expression and production of IL-6. In contrast, the overexpression of HuR increased IL-6 mRNA expression and production in OBA-9. The HuR inhibitor, quercetin suppressed Pg-induced HuR mRNA expression and IL-6 production in OBA-9. An oral inoculation with quercetin also inhibited bone resorption in ligature-induced periodontitis model mice as a result of downregulation of IL-6. These results show that HuR modulates inflammatory responses by regulating IL-6. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine the anti-inflammatory effect of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on human dental pulp cells (HDPCs) and identify the intracellular signaling pathway involved. We investigated the effect of BDNF (50\u00a0ng/ml) on interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 expression in peptidoglycan (PGN)-treated HDPCs. An inhibition assay was performed with MAPK or NF-\u03baB inhibitors to determine the possible signaling pathway. IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA, IL-6 and IL-8 protein, and phosphorylated p38 kinase activity were determined using real-time PCR, ELISA, and Western blot analysis, respectively. BDNF significantly attenuated PGN-induced IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA and protein levels in HDPCs. A p38 inhibitor also inhibited IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA transcription. PGN stimulated phosphorylated p38 kinase activity in HDPCs, which was inhibited by BDNF. Suppression of phosphorylated p38 kinase activity by BDNF in HDPCs inhibited increased IL-6 and IL-8 expression induced by PGN. Our findings suggest that BDNF regulates intracellular signaling molecule activities to exert its anti-inflammatory effect.",

The complement system plays a critical role in immune responses. C5a has been implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases, including PD and RA.

Tissue regeneration is characterized by inflammation, which directs the quality of tissue repair. The objective of this study is to propose the relevance of BDNF to inflammation. In this study, we investigated the effect of BDNF on intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, which is an inflammatory marker, expressed in interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2-treated human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs). In addition, we studied the effect of BDNF on the adhesion of neutrophil-like differentiated HL-60 cells to HMVECs in a cell adhesion assay. We demonstrated that BDNF attenuates the IL-1\u03b2-induced ICAM-1 mRNA and protein expression. Treatment of HMVECs with IL-1\u03b2 led to an increase in the number of adherent neutrophil-like HL-60 cells. BDNF significantly decreased the number of neutrophil-like HL-60 cells attached to HMVECs. In conclusion, BDNF may reduce excess inflammation through reduced neutrophil recruitment by regulating ICAM-1 expression. ",

        "abstract": "Diabetic patients are at an increased risk of developing severe and progressive periodontitis. Periodontal disease also increases the severity of diabetes by enhancing insulin resistance. Therefore, the regulation of periodontal inflammation in diabetic patients may contribute to the control of both diseases. Glycyrrhizic acid exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). HMGB1, one of the ligands of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), is a damage-associated molecular pattern and induces inflammatory cytokine production. In the present study, we examined the effects of glycyrrhizic acid on ligature- and Porphyromonas gulae infection-induced periodontitis as well as the involvement of the HMGB1-RAGE axis in diabetic model mice. The molars of diabetic model mice, established by feeding HFD32 to KK/TaJcl mice, were subjected to silk thread ligation and P. gulae was then intraorally applied in the presence or absence of glycyrrhizic acid given topically. The topical application of glycyrrhizic acid suppressed ligature/P. gulae-induced increases in interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 at the mRNA level in the gingiva and at the protein level in serum. Furthermore, glycyrrhizic acid suppressed ligature/P. gulae-induced increases in serum amyloid A (SAA) in serum and fasting blood glucose levels. It also suppressed ligature/P. gulae-induced increases of HMGB1 and RAGE at the mRNA level in the gingiva and at the protein level in serum. A mouse anti-HMGB1-neutralizing antibody inhibited increases in serum glucose levels. In conclusion, topical treatments with glycyrrhizic acid may suppress periodontal and systemic inflammation and reduce blood glucose levels through the HMGB1-RAGE axis in diabetic mice.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Drug-induced gingival overgrowth (DIGO) is a side effect of the enlargement of gingival tissue by phenytoin, nifedipine, and cyclosporine A (CsA). Gingival inflammation has been identified as a key factor that initiates DIGO. However, a sufficient animal model for clarifying the role of inflammation in DIGO has not yet been generated. We herein describe a novel CsA-induced gingival overgrowth mouse model to evaluate the role of inflammation. A ligature was placed around the second molar in maxillae for 7\u00a0days to induce gingival inflammation, and CsA (50\u00a0mg/kg/day) was administered to mice during each experimental period. The severity of gingival overgrowth and mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines in gingiva were assessed by the gingival overgrowth degree, histological analyses, and RT-PCR. The administration of CsA for 28\u00a0days in combination with ligation significantly increased the gingival overgrowth degree and expanded the connective tissue area. Increases in the gingival overgrowth degree continued in a time-dependent manner until 21\u00a0days. Furthermore, the cessation of CsA reduced gingival overgrowth. Thin ligatures (7\u20130 size) induced weaker tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and IL-6 mRNA expression and less gingival overgrowth than thick ligatures (5\u20130 ligature). Moreover, the administration of an antibiotic cocktail, which suppressed the expression of these inflammatory cytokines in gingiva, attenuated gingival overgrowth induced by ligatures and CsA. These results suggest that inflammation in gingival tissue plays a role in initiating CsA-induced gingival overgrowth. This gingival overgrowth mouse model has potential for elucidating the etiology of DIGO from the view point of gingival inflammation.",

        "abstract": "Summary  Periodontal disease is a bacterial biofilm-associated inflammatory disease that has been implicated in many systemic diseases. A new preventive method for periodontal disease needs to be developed in order to promote the health of the elderly in a super-aged society. The gingival epithelium plays an important role as a mechanical barrier against bacterial invasion and a part of the innate immune response to infectious inflammation in periodontal tissue. The disorganization of cell\u2013cell interactions and subsequent inflammation contribute to the initiation of periodontal disease. These make us consider that regulation of host defensive functions, epithelial barrier and neutrophil activity, may become novel preventive methods for periodontal inflammation. Based on this concept, we have found that several agents regulate the barrier function of gingival epithelial cells and suppress the accumulation of neutrophils in the gingival epithelium. We herein introduce the actions of irsogladine maleate, azithromycin, amphotericin B, and  Houttuynia cordata  (dokudami in Japanese), which is commonly used in traditional medicine, on the epithelial barrier and neutrophil migration in gingival epithelial cells  in vivo  and  in vitro , in order to provide support for the clinical application of these agents to the prevention of periodontal inflammation.",

The purpose of this study was to establish an essential component of a rational approach for the clinical application of BDNF in periodontal regenerative therapy. Here, we assessed the sequence of early events in BDNF-induced periodontal tissue regeneration, especially from the aspect of cementum regeneration. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor was applied into experimental periodontal defects in Beagle dogs. The localization of cells positive for neurotrophic tyrosine kinase, receptor, type 2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, osteopontin, integrin \u03b1V\u03b23, and integrin \u03b12\u03b21 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The effects of BDNF on adhesion of cultured human periodontal ligament cells was examined by an in vitro study. The results suggest that BDNF could induce rapid cementum regeneration by stimulating adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of periodontal ligament cells in the early regenerative phase, resulting in enhancement of periodontal tissue regeneration.",

Amphotericin B, a major antifungal drug, binds to cholesterol in the mammalian cell membrane in addition to fungal ergosterol.

To investigate the suppressive effect of amphotericin B on the gingival epithelium, we examined the expression of interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-6 and involvement of MAP kinase in human gingival epithelial cells (HGEC) stimulated by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Amphotericin B and the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor down-regulated the A. actinomycetemcomitans-induced increase in the expression of IL-8 and IL-6 at the mRNA. The ERK inhibitor suppressed the A. actinomycetemcomitans-induced IL-8 mRNA expression. Amphotericin B inhibited the A. actinomycetemcomitans-induced phosphorylation of ERK and p38 MAP kinase. Furthermore, amphotericin B inhibited the A. actinomycetemcomitans-induced production of prostaglandin E2. These results suggest that amphotericin B regulate inflammatory responses in HGEC.",

        "abstract": "Gingival junctional epithelial cell apoptosis caused by periodontopathic bacteria exacerbates periodontitis. This pathological apoptosis is involved in the activation of transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2). However, the molecular mechanisms by which microbes induce the activation of TGF-\u03b2 remain unclear. We previously reported that Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) activated TGF-\u03b2 receptor (TGF-\u03b2R)/smad2 signaling to induce epithelial cell apoptosis, even though Aa cannot bind to TGF-\u03b2R. Additionally, outer membrane protein 29\u2009kDa (Omp29), a member of the Aa Omps family, can induce actin rearrangements via FAK signaling, which also plays a role in the activation of TGF-\u03b2 by cooperating with integrin. Accordingly, we hypothesized that Omp29-induced actin rearrangements via FAK activity would enhance the activation of TGF-\u03b2, leading to gingival epithelial cell apoptosis in vitro. By using human gingival epithelial cell line OBA9, we found that Omp29 activated TGF-\u03b2R/smad2 signaling and decreased active TGF-\u03b2 protein levels in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of cell culture, suggesting the transactivation of TGF-\u03b2R. Inhibition of actin rearrangements by cytochalasin D or blebbistatin and knockdown of FAK or integrin\u03b21 expression by siRNA transfection attenuated TGF-\u03b2R/smad2 signaling activity and reduction of TGF-\u03b2 levels in the ECM caused by Omp29. Furthermore, Omp29 bound to fibronectin (Fn) to induce its aggregation on integrin\u03b21, which is associated with TGF-\u03b2 signaling activity. All the chemical inhibitors and siRNAs tested blocked Omp29-induced OBA9 cells apoptosis. These results suggest that Omp29 binds to Fn in order to facilitate Fn/integrin\u03b21/FAK signaling-dependent TGF-\u03b2 release from the ECM, thereby inducing gingival epithelial cell apoptosis via TGF-\u03b2R/smad2 pathway.",

        "abstract": "An investigation of the mechanisms underlying the production of inflammatory cytokines through the stimulation of microorganisms on gingival epithelial cells may provide insights into the pathogenesis of the initiation of periodontitis. Lipid rafts, microdomains in the cell membrane, include a large number of receptors, and are centrally involved in signal transduction. We herein examined the involvement of lipid rafts in the expression of interleukin (IL-6) and IL-8 in gingival epithelial cells stimulated by periodontal pathogens.OBA9, a human gingival cell line, was stimulated by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 in the presence of methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD).A. actinomycetemcomitans or TNF-\u03b1 increased IL-8 and IL-6 mRNA levels, and promoted the phosphorylation of ERK and p38 MAP kinase in OBA9. The pretreatment with M\u03b2CD abolished increases in IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA levels and the phosphorylation induced by A. actinomycetemcomitans, but did not suppress the response induced by TNF-\u03b1. The transfection of TLR4 inhibited A. actinomycetemcomitans-induced increases in IL-8 and IL-6 mRNA levels. Confocal microscopy revealed that M\u03b2CD inhibited the mobilization of TLR4 into lipid rafts.The mobilization of TLR4 into lipid rafts is involved in the expression of inflammatory cytokines and phosphorylation of MAP kinase in human gingival epithelial cells stimulated by A. actinomycetemcomitans.",

        "abstract": "Periodontitis is an infectious inflammatory disease. Our previous studies have revealed that irsogladine maleate (IM) regulates intercellular junctional function and chemokine secretion in gingival epithelium, resulting in the suppression of the onset of periodontal disease in a rat model. Therefore, it is plausible that IM is a promising preventive remedy for periodontal disease. In this study, to gain a better understanding of IM in gingival epithelial cells, we employed a DNA microarray analysis. More specifically, human gingival epithelial cells (HGEC) were exposed to Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A. actinomycetemcomitans) in the presence or absence of IM. Then, a human genome focus array was used. A. actinomycetemcomitans facilitated the expression of several inflammatory-related genes, including these for matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, interleukin (IL)-6, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in HGEC, while these mRNA levels were attenuated by IM treatment. Importantly, consistent with mRNA levels, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence staining and ELISA analysis indicated that IM also abrogated the A. actinomycetemcomitans-induced increase in MMP-3, IL-6, and ICAM-1 at the protein level. In addition, inhibition of the ERK or p38 MAP kinase signaling cascade, previously reported to be disturbed by IM treatment in HGEC, clearly blocked A. actinomycetemcomitans-induced MMP-3, IL-6, or ICAM-1 protein expression. Moreover, animal study revealed that IM-pretreatment inhibited the A. actinomycetemcomitans-induced increase of ICAM-1 in gingival junctional epithelium. Taken together, these results suggested that IM can regulate inflammatory responses in HGEC by inhibiting the ERK or p38 MAP kinase signaling cascade, which may result in suppression of inflammation in gingival tissue, thereby contributing to the prevention of periodontitis.",

        "abstract": "Gingival junctional epithelium (JE) actively contributes to the homeostasis of the periodontium. Altered activation of TGF-\u03b2 signalling is implicated in the epithelium from chronic periodontitis. However, little is known about the effects of TGF-\u03b2 signalling on the JE. In this study, we investigated the relationship between Smad2, which plays an important role in mediating TGF-\u03b2 signal, and induction of apoptosis in the JE.K14-Smad2 transgenic mice were used to observe the effect of over-expression of Smad2 driven by CK14 promoter in the JE. We performed TUNEL technique to evaluate the epithelial apoptosis. Expression of apoptosis related genes was examined using real-time PCR and immunofluorescence.K14-Smad2 mice showed an increased number of phospho-Smad2 positive JE cells associated with an increase in TGF-\u03b21 expression. K14-Smad2 mice have a significantly higher percentage of TUNEL positive cells in the JE. Immunofluorescence double labelling revealed that TUNEL positive cells showed immunoreactivity to phospho-Smad2. Real-time PCR analysis of apoptosis related gene expression provided evidence of lower expression of Bcl-2 in the gingival tissue from K14-Smad2 mice. There was a strong positive reaction for Bcl-2 protein in the junctional epithelium of wild type mice, while the gingival tissue of K14-Smad2 transgenic mice had only a faint signal for Bcl-2.The present study provided evidence that Smad2 plays a crucial role in the induction of apoptosis in gingival JE through inhibition of Bcl-2.",

        "abstract": "Periodontitis is the most prevalent infectious disease caused by periodontopathic bacteria and is also a chronic inflammatory disease. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) is an inflammatory exudate that seeps into the gingival crevices or periodontal pockets around teeth with inflamed gingiva, and contains various materials including leukocytes and cytokines. Since gingival epithelial cells, which form a barrier against bacterial challenges, are affected by GCF, cytokines or other materials contained within GCF are engaged in the maintenance and disruption of the epithelial barrier. Accordingly, its compositional pattern has been employed as a reliable objective index of local inflammation. Transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) levels in GCF were previously shown to be markedly higher in patients with periodontitis than in healthy subject. However, it currently remains unclear how TGF-\u03b21 affects gingival epithelial cell growth or apoptosis; therefore, elucidating the mechanism responsible may lead to a deeper understanding of pathogenic periodontitis. In the present study, the human gingival epithelial cell line, OBA9 cells were stimulated with recombinant TGF-\u03b21. Apoptosis-related protein levels were determined by Western blotting. Caspase-3/7 activity was measured with a Caspase-Glo assay kit. Surviving and apoptotic cells were detected using an MTS assay and TUNEL staining, respectively. TGF-\u03b2RI siRNA and smad2 siRNA were transfected into cells using the lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent. TGF-\u03b21 elevated caspase-3 activity and the number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells in OBA9 cells. Furthermore, while the levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, Bak, Bim, and Bad were increased in OBA9 cells stimulated with TGF-\u03b21, the TGF-\u03b21 treatment also decreased the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in a time-dependent manner. Additionally, TGF-\u03b21 up-regulated the protein levels of cleaved caspase-9. These results indicated that TGF-\u03b21-induced apoptosis was involved in a mitochondria-related intrinsic pathway. TGF-\u03b21 phosphorylated smad2 in OBA9 cells and this phosphorylation was clearly reduced by SB431542 (a TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor inhibitor). Consistent with this result, SB431542 or smad2 siRNA-induced reductions in smad2 protein expression levels attenuated TGF-\u03b21-induced apoptosis. On the other hand, the ligation of TGF-\u03b21 on its receptor also stimulated the phosphorylation of Erk and Akt, which are smad2-independent pathways. However, the inhibition of Erk/Akt signaling pathways by U0126, a MEK-Erk inhibitor and LY294002, a PI3Kinase-Akt inhibitor, augmented TGF-\u03b21-induced apoptosis in OBA9 cells. Taken together, the results of present study demonstrated that TGF-\u03b21 activated both the smad2 and Erk/Akt cascades via its receptor on gingival epithelial cells, even though these two pathways have opposite roles in cell death and survival, and the culmination of these signaling events induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in gingival epithelial cells. Based on the results of the present study, we herein proposed for the first time, that TGF-\u03b21 is a novel target cytokine for monitoring the progression of periodontal disease.",

In lymphnodes without metastasis,\n lower suppressor cell activities were noted, and numerous Leu-3+ (helper/inducer) cells were present, while Leu-2+ cells were less frequent. NK cell activity against K-562 cells was enhanced by elimination of Leu-2+/OKT-8+ cells with complement-mediated lysis.

        "abstract": "To elucidate the role of the spleen on immunosuppression of gastric and esophageal cancer, suppressor cell activities of spleen cells (SCs), splenic vein lymphocytes (SVLs) and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were investigated. Concanavalin-A induced suppressor cell (Con-AS) activity of SCs was significantly higher in patients with gastric cancer than in those with benign diseases. Higher Con-AS activity of SCs was observed in esophageal cancer patients with tumors located in the lower portion of the esophagus. In comparison with suppressor activities of SCs and SVLs, the decrease of the predominance of suppressor precursors in SCs and the increase of the spontaneously activated suppressor cells in SVLs were noted with the advance of the tumors. Culture supernatants from splenic adherent cells significantly induced suppressor cell activities as well as did sera from splenic venous blood. From these results, it is concluded that the generation of suppressor precursors in the spleen is dependent on the location of tumors and that the maturation of suppressor cells occurs in the spleen by factors released from splenic adherent cells, then migrates into the peripheral blood.",

However, the indicators of surgical resection for IPMN, especially for branch duct IPMN, still remain controversial.Eighty-two patients with IPMN who underwent surgical resection during April 1998 to January 2009, were retrospectively reviewed and examined with regard to their preoperative factors and pathologic diagnosis.Multivariate analysis showed that main duct IPMN (P<0.01) and earlier diabetes (P=0.03) were independent predictors of malignant IPMN. In branch duct IPMN, the diameter of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) was found to be significantly associated with malignancy by univariate analysis (P=0.034). An elevated serum CA19-9 level (P<0.01) was an independent predictor of invasive IPMN.Our observations suggest that main duct IPMN, branch duct IPMN with MPD dilatation, and IPMN with an elevated serum CA19-9 level should be considered as indications for surgical resection.",

In this report, we demonstrate how CagA protein regulates the functions of dendritic cells (DC) against H. pylori infection. In addition, we found that CagA protein was tyrosine-phosphorylated in DC. The responses to cagA-positive H. pylori in DC were reduced in comparison to those induced by cagA-negative H. pylori. CagA-overexpressing DC also exhibited a decline in the responses against LPS stimulation and the differentiation of CD4(+) T cells toward Th1 type cells compared to wild type DC. In addition, the level of phosphorylated IRF3 decreased in CagA-overexpressing DC stimulated with LPS, indicating that activated SHP-2 suppressed the enzymatic activity of TBK1 and consequently IRF3 phosphorylation. These data suggest that CagA protein negatively regulates the functions of DC via CagA phosphorylation and that cagA-positive H. pylori strains suppress host immune responses resulting in their chronic colonization of the stomach.",

        "abstract": "Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) enables less invasive en bloc resection not only in the stomach but also in thinner-walled luminal organs such as the esophagus and colorectum. Although ESD using short needle knives provides safe and effective resection, there are certain challenges to overcome. The long procedure time, the high level of technical difficulty, and the high incidence of complications such as bleeding and perforation are some of the barriers to widespread practice of the technique. Because of the low hemostatic properties of needle knives, such as the standard Flush knife with water jet\u2013emitting function, we have recently developed the ball-tip Flush knife (Flush knife BT). As predicted, the density of the current at the tip of the ball-tip Flush knife decreased compared with that of the standard Flush knife and hemostatic efficiency improved. Using either the standard Flush knife or the Flush knife BT in our unit, we have resected a total of 2112 early gastrointestinal lesions (stomach, 976; esophagus, 387; colorectum, 749) in 1820 patients with good results\u2014total postoperative bleeding rate 1.7%, total perforation rate 1.5%, en bloc resection rate 99.6%, en bloc R0 resection rate 96.6%, and curative resection rate 87.5%. The standard Flush knife and the Flush knife BT are useful for technically and histopathologically appropriate submucosal dissection. The standard Flush knife is especially useful in difficult cases with a thin luminal wall, rich vessels, and severe fibrosis. The Flush knife BT can facilitate faster ESD with fewer complications, which is attributed to its improved operability and hemostatic properties.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Sphincter of Oddi disorder (SOD) is a functional disorder of the sphincter of Oddi (SO) and is pathophysiologically equivalent to functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID) of the digestive tract. SOD is important as a cause of biliary pain of unknown origin and idiopathic acute recurrent pancreatitis; however, the concept of SOD has not generally spread in the same way as FGID. SOD is diagnosed using ROME III criteria which were revised in 2006 to reduce the number of unnecessary and potentially risky procedures. Many cases of SOD still need SO manometry (SOM) which is performed during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). It is problematic that SOD patients, who already have a high risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis, require SOM for a definitive diagnosis. SOM is an invasive examination that is accompanied by a high risk of post-procedure pancreatitis and can be performed only at a limited number of institutions because of technical difficulties. In the treatment of SOD, the effectiveness of the drugs is uncertain, and the role of drug therapy in the management of SOD has not yet been established. In recent years, endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) has been recognized as standard treatment for SOD; however, the effect of EST is not yet clear. The development of less invasive diagnostic techniques is desirable in the future. Furthermore, patient eligibility criteria for EST and the long-term prognosis after EST should be clarified.",

        "abstract": "We report the case of a 56-year-old female with lipomatous hypertrophy of the pancreas. Abdominal CT and MRI showed fatty replacement over the entire pancreas. The pancreatic parenchyma was completely absent. ERCP showed no abnormal findings in the main pancreatic duct. EUS-FNA was performed to achieve a definitive diagnosis. Histological features of the FNA specimens revealed that adipose tissue generally replaced the pancreatic parenchyma, and pancreatic acini were identified with a scattered distribution. To consider the differential diagnosis of lipomatous pseudohypertrophy of the pancreas, it is necessary to distinguish it from obesity, diabetes, and age-related pancreatic fat infiltration and liposarcoma. By performing EUS-FNA, it was possible to obtain a definitive diagnosis in this patient. In conclusion, EUS-FNA may be helpful to make a definitive diagnosis in patients with lipomatous hypertrophy of the pancreas. ",

        "abstract": "Lipoxins, which are bioactive lipids derived from omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, play important roles in various biological functions. In this study, the anti-inflammatory effects of lipoxin A(4) (LXA4; 5S,6R,15S-trihydroxy-7,9,13-trans-11-eicosatetraenoic acid) were investigated in in vitro cultured cell experiments and in vivo animal experiments. In mouse peritoneal macrophages and mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cells, LXA4 reduced the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced increase in the mRNA expression level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. LXA4 also reduced the LPS-induced nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). In an LPS-induced acute inflammation mouse model, the injection of LXA4 at 5 microg/kg b.wt. led to down-regulation of the TNF-alpha level in serum and the TNF-alpha mRNA expression level in intestinal epithelial cells. Moreover, LXA4 reduced the LPS-caused phosphorylation of IkappaB kinases, IkappaB, and NF-kappaB, the degradation of IkappaB, and the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB in intestinal epithelial cells. In a coculture system using RAW264.7 cells and human colon carcinoma cell line Caco-2 cells, treatment with LXA4 to Caco-2 cells led to reduction of LPS-evoked TNF-alpha production in RAW264.7 cells and interleukin-8 mRNA expression in Caco-2 cells. These results indicate that LXA4 exerts anti-inflammatory effects through inhibition of NF-kappaB activation, and, therefore, LXA4 may be useful as a therapeutic strategy against intestinal mucosa inflammation.",

        "abstract": "Recently, guidelines for the treatment and prevention of ulcers induced by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were established. This study investigated the association between the current adherence to the guidelines and the incidence of gastric mucosal lesions caused by NSAIDs.This study included 254 NSAIDs users (128 regular and 126 on-demand users) who had undergone upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The patients were characterized as high risk based on the following: age 65 years or older, history of peptic ulcers, concurrent use of corticosteroids or anticoagulants, and high-dose NSAIDs use. Adherence was defined as the prescription of NSAIDs with proton pump inhibitors, prostaglandin analogues, or high-dose histamine 2 receptor antagonists in high-risk NSAIDs user. The severity of gastric mucosal lesions was evaluated using the modified LANZA score (MLS).Seventy-nine (61.7%) of the regular NSAIDs users and 65 (51.6%) of the on-demand NSAIDs users met our definition of high-risk patients. Adherence in the regular NSAIDs users and on-demand NSAIDs users was 25 (31.7%) and 16 (24.6%), respectively. The incidence of gastric mucosal lesions (MLS \u2267 1) was significantly higher in the nonadherence group than in the adherence group for both regular NSAIDs users (59.3 vs. 28.0%, P = 0.01) and on-demand NSAIDs users (63.3 vs. 25.0%, P = 0.01). Gastric ulcers in the regular NSAIDs users were more frequently observed in the nonadherence group than in the adherence group (29.6 vs. 4.0%, P < 0.01).Nonadherence was associated with a high prevalence of NSAIDs-induced gastric mucosal lesions.",

        "abstract": "The efficacy of histamine H2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapies in healing reflux esophagitis was compared in a prospective randomized case-control comparative study. A total of 71 patients with grade A to D esophagitis (Los Angeles classification) were given either famotidine 20 mg twice a day (Fam; n = 35) or omeprazole 20 mg once daily (Ome; n = 36) for 8 weeks. Endoscopy was performed to assess healing in 57 patients. Healed patients were followed-up without H2RA or PPI therapy for 3 months. At the end of follow-up, endoscopy was able to be performed in 33 patients. Healing rates for patients in the Fam and Ome groups were 58.6% (17/OFF and 97.4% (27/28), respectively (P < 0.001), and when limited to grade A to B, healing rates were 60.9% (14/23) and 100% (25/25), respectively (P < 0.001). Concerning Helicobacter pylori infection, healing rates for the Fam and Ome groups in H. pylori (+) patients were 90.0% (9/10) and 90.9% (10/11), respectively (P = 1.00). Remission rates in the Fam and Ome groups were 45.0% (91/2)) and 33.3% (6/18), respectively (P > 0.4). In regard to alcohol drinking, remission rates of daily and social drinkers were 7.7% and 42.4%, respectively (P < 0.03). Thus, PPI should be the drug of choice even for healing lower-grade reflux esophagitis, especially in H. pylori (-) patients. Treatment with H2RA may be an alternative choice in H. pylori (+) patients. After healing, most patients cannot sustain remission without maintenance therapy.",

Because we recognized a partial response to the chemoradiotherapy, we subsequently administered combined chemotherapy with S-1 and cisplatin. After one course of this combined chemotherapy, the tumor was further reduced in size and became difficult to discern on abdominal computed tomography (CT). We have continued to administer the S-1 and cisplatin combined chemotherapy, and the patient is still alive. After 20 months of treatment, the tumor has not recurred (as assessed by abdominal CT). Additionally, we have not seen elevation of tumor markers. This report presents the successful use of chemoradiotherapy with low-dose FP and additional combined chemotherapy with S-1 and cisplatin for unresectable pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma.",

In this paper energy use from all industrial sectors in China's economy of 2007 was explored by conducting an extended environmental input-output analysis. We compare the energy consumption embodied in the final demand for goods and services from 29 sectors with the energy demand required for the actual production process in each sector. Two different viewpoints for sectoral energy use have been presented: energy use is directly allocated to the producer entity, and energy use is reallocated to sector's supply chain from consumption perspective. Our results show that considerable amount of energy use is embodied in the supply chain, especially for \"Construction\" and \"Other Service Activities\" sectors, which is not detected if energy use is allocated on a production basis. When further dividing embodied energy consumption into direct energy consumption and indirect energy consumption, total indirect energy consumption is much higher than that of total direct energy consumption, accounting for 80.6% of total embodied energy consumption in 2007. Our results provide a more holistic picture on sectoral energy consumption and therefore can help decision-makers make more appropriate policies. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

They contribute significantly to the emissions of greenhouse gas and air pollutants. Policy makers consider the introduction of new emissions standard vehicles and alternative fuel vehicles in bus and taxi fleets as an attractive measure for reducing the emissions of greenhouse gas and air pollutants. It is important to understand the environmental benefits and economic challenges involved in fleet conversion. However, few studies have been conducted, especially in developing countries. This study analyzes the cost effectiveness and environmental benefits of various vehicles by employing a case study in Shenyang, China. The results showed that CNG bus has the best overall economic and environmental performances, while diesel car is one possible choice for taxi selection when considering the current technology level. Although direct emissions are lower for both hybrid and electricity vehicles, embodied emissions are higher, plus higher costs, making them not suitable as public transportation tools, at least for the current stage. In order to further improve co-benefits in public transportation sector, an integrated effort is needed, including the gradual phase-out of inefficient vehicles, green vehicle purchase, infrastructure improvement and capacity-building initiatives. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "The combustion of fossil fuel contributes to not only global warming but also the emissions of air pollutants. In China, the rapid growth of energy consumption leads to a large quantity of greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutant emissions. Although many measures have been proposed by the local governments to mitigate the GHG emissions and improve air quality, limited economic resources slow the efforts of the local government to implement measures to control both types of emissions. The co-benefits approach can use resources efficiently to solve multiple environmental problems. In this study, we first calculated the CO2 and air pollutants (SO2, NOx and PM2.5) emissions in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Then, the co-benefits of wind power, including mitigation of CO2 and air pollutants (SO2, NOx and PM2.5) emissions and water savings, were assessed and quantified in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The results demonstrate that, during the 11th five-year period (2006-2010), emissions mitigation by wind power accounted for 4.88% (1065 \u00d7 104 t) of CO2, 4.31% (4.38 \u00d7 104 t) of SO2, 8.23% (3.41 \u00d7 104 t) of NOx and 4.23% (0.32 \u00d7 104 t) of PM2.5 emission by the thermal power sector. The total economic co-benefits of wind power accounted for 0.46% (1.38 billion 2009US$) of the GDP of Xinjiang during 2006-2010. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "With China's rapid economic development and urbanization process, cities are facing great challenges for tackling anthropogenic climate change. In this paper we present features, trajectories and driving forces for energy-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from four Chinese mega-cities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing) during 1995-2009. First, top-down GHG inventories of these four cities, including direct emissions (scope 1) and emissions from imported electricity (scope 2) are presented. Then, the driving forces for the GHG emission changes are uncovered by adopting a time serial LMDI decomposition analysis. Results indicate that annual GHG emission in these four cities exceeds more than 500 million tons and such an amount is still rapidly growing. GHG emissions are mainly generated from energy use in industrial sector and coal-burning thermal power plants. The growth of GHG emissions in four mega-cities during 1995-2009 is mainly due to economic activity effect, partially offset by improvements in carbon intensity. Besides, the proportion of indirect GHG emission from imported energy use (scope 2) keeps growing, implying that big cities are further dependent on energy/material supplies from neighboring regions. Therefore, a comprehensive consideration on various perspectives is needed so that different stakeholders can better understand their responsibilities on reducing total GHG emissions. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Moving towards an eco-city, the local universities should play an active role. To create a green university is one effort so that all the faculties, staff members and students can join such an effort. However, how to initiate a green university project remains questionable in China. In this paper an integrated model on green university is proposed. Such a model aims to manage all the campus activities on a sustainable basis. It addresses all the issues related with one university's metabolism and ensures that the views and goals of different stakeholders are considered together. In order to test its feasibility, a case study approach is employed. Shenyang University (SU) was chosen due to its unique feature and data availability. Various efforts at SU are detailed, such as the application of ground source heat pump, wastewater recycling at the campus level, integrated solid waste management (such as collection of discarded PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles, etc), green education and research. With all these efforts, significant economic, environmental and social benefits have been received, such as more efficient materials and energy use, cost savings from lowered insurance costs and reduced environmental penalties, reduction of greenhouse gas emission, reduction of wastewater discharge and solid wastes, avoidance of toxic materials, increased environmental awareness, improved green image, etc. The achievements that Shenyang University has made have demonstrated a robust model to other Chinese universities so that they can start their initiatives by considering their own realities. During this process, the close collaboration with local government, strong leadership and a comprehensive plan will be necessary so that all the stakeholders can join it and more resources can be gained to support its implementation. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "With rapid economic development in China, water crisis is becoming serious and may impede future sustainable development. The uneven distribution of water resources further aggravates such a problem. Under such a circumstance, the concepts of water footprint and virtual water have been proposed in order to respond water scarcity problems. This paper focuses on studying provincial disparity of China's water footprints and inter-provincial virtual water trade flows by adopting inter-regional input-output (IRIO) method. The results show that fast developing areas with larger economic scales such as Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shandong, Zhejiang, Shanghai and Xinjiang had the largest water footprints. The most developed and water scarce areas such as Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin and Shandong intended to import virtual water, a rational choice for mitigating their water crisis. Xinjiang, Jiangsu, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Guangxi and Hunan, had the largest per GDP water intensities and were the main water import regions. Another key finding is that agriculture water footprint was the main part in water footprint composition and water export trade. On the basis of these findings, policy implications on agriculture geographical dispersion, consumption behavior changes, trade structure adjustment and water use efficiency improvement are further discussed.",

We carry out a time series driver assessment in Shenyang city, one of the most famous heavy industrial cities in China by employing STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology) model. Population growth has been one driver on emissions growth over the past decades, while urbanization can also significantly affect carbon emissions. In addition, the per capita GDP and carbon emissions are still coupled and expected decoupling development has yet to come. By setting up different scenarios for Shenyang's future development and conducting scenario analysis, we find that the cumulative CO 2 emissions can decrease by 6.5% and 20.3% for low carbon and enhanced low carbon scenarios during 2010-2030, compared to business as usual (BAU) scenario, respectively. Furthermore, remarkable co-benefits on reducing main air pollutants are observed if greenhouse gas mitigation measures can be fully implemented, in which that the reduction of SO 2 and PM 10 emissions are more obvious than NO x. By considering the local realities, to reasonably control the population, optimize the energy structure, and promote the low carbon technologies could bring co-benefits so that the cities can move toward low carbon development. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Industrial parks have become the effective strategies for government to promote sustainable economic development due to the following advantages: shared infrastructure and concentrated industrial activities within planned areas. However, due to intensive energy consumption and dependence on fossil fuels, industrial parks have become the main areas for greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, it is critical to quantify their carbon footprints so that appropriate emission reduction policies can be raised. The objective of this paper is to seek an appropriate method on evaluating the carbon footprint of one industrial park. The tiered hybrid LCA method was selected due to its advantages over other methods. Shenyang Economic and Technological Development Zone (SETDZ), a typical comprehensive industrial park in China, was chosen as a case study park. The results show that the total life cycle carbon footprint of SETDZ was 15.29. Mt, including 6.81. Mt onsite (direct) carbon footprint, 8.47. Mt upstream carbon footprint, and only 3201. t downstream carbon footprint. Analysis from industrial sector perspectives shows that chemical industry and manufacture of general purpose machinery and special purposes machinery sector were the two largest sectors for life cycle carbon footprint. Such a sector analysis may be useful for investigation of appropriate emission reduction policies. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "In order to uncover driving forces for provincial CO2 emission in China, a case study was undertaken to shed light on the CO2 emission growth in such a region. Liaoning province was selected due to its typical features as one industrial province. The environmental input-output analysis and structure decomposing analysis have been conducted in order to provide a holistic picture on Liaoning's CO2 emissions during 1997-2007. Research outcomes indicate that rapid increase of per capita consumption activities is the main driver for Liaoning to have a significant CO2 emission growth, followed by consumption structure, production structure and population size. Energy intensity and energy structure partly offset the CO2 emission increase. Electricity power and heat supply and construction sectors caused the most CO2 emission, indicating that more specific mitigation policies for these two sectors should be prepared. From final demand point of view, it is clear that trade plays a leading role in regional CO2 emission, followed by fixed capital investment and urban household consumption which become increasingly important over time. Consequently, in order to realize low carbon development, local governments should consider all these factors so that appropriate mitigation policies can be raised by considering the local realities. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Medical waste management is of great importance due to its potential environmental and public health risks, especially in developing countries where both financial and technological resources on medical waste management are still lacking. Although many studies have focused on country-scaled medical waste management, few have paid close attention to regional (city-scale) management, particularly in China. This paper fills such a gap by employing a case study approach. Due to its representative nature, Shenyang was selected as the case study. After a review of China's medical waste management, an empirical study in Shenyang was conducted in order to analyze the current state as well as identify key challenges on regional medical waste management. Based upon the local realities and aiming to better manage medical wastes, an integrated medical waste management framework is developed. Such a platform encourages the establishment of a specific medical waste management authority, a city scaled capacity building program on improving the general public's awareness, an information platform, application of state-of-the-art technologies, as well as creation of an effective financial system. The combination of such initiatives can significantly improve the overall eco-efficiency of medical waste management at the regional level and should be promoted to other developing cities. \u00a9 2013 Springer Japan.",

        "abstract": "Cities consumed 84% of commercial energy in China, which indicates cities should be the main areas for GHG emissions reduction. Our case study of Shenyang in this paper shows how a clear inventory analysis on GHG emissions at city level can help to identify the major industries and societal sectors for reduction efforts so as to facilitate low-carbon policy-making. The results showed total carbon emission in 2007 was 57Mt CO2 equivalents (CO2e), of which 41Mt CO2e was in-boundary emissions and 16Mt CO2e was out-of-boundary emissions. The energy sector was dominant in the emission inventory, accounting for 93.1% of total emissions. Within energy sector, emissions from energy production industry, manufacturing and construction industry accounted for 88.4% of this sector. Our analysis showed that comparing with geographical boundary, setting system boundary based on single process standard could provide better information to decision makers for carbon emission reduction. After attributing electricity and heating consumption to final users, the resident and commercial sector became the largest emitter, accounting for 28.5% of total emissions. Spatial analysis of emissions showed that industrial districts such as Shenbei and Tiexi had the large potential to reduce their carbon emissions. Implications of results are finally discussed. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "With material and energy flow features, iron/steel industry has unique advantage in the industrial symbiosis (IS) formation to realize environmental and economic benefit simultaneously. The quantification of the scale and significance of IS benefits is valuable for IS promotion, while there is much few attention to it, especially in China. Under this circumstance, this paper evaluates and compares the number, scale and the related environmental/economic gains of IS activities in iron/steel-centered industrial areas in Liuzhou and Jinan in China, and Kawasaki in Japan. Results show that: in Liuzhou, there are three symbiosis activities between industries. The annual by-product/waste exchange is more than 2 million ton/y, gaining economic revenue more than 36.55 million USD for the iron/steel company. In Jinan, seven symbiotic links are between industries, and two are between urban community and iron/steel plant. The total by-product/waste exchange is over 8 million ton/y and the economic gains account to 158 million USD. In Kawasaki, iron/steel industry relates to four symbiotic links, the total by-product/waste exchange amount is about 500 kton/y, with the economic gains over 54 million USD. The form and the complexity of the IS network are different in the three cases. IS in Liuzhou and Jinan are with the features of large number and scale, but single types. While in Kawasaki, IS includes not only traditional exchanges between iron/steel plant and the other industries, but also the innovative utilization of urban refuse by industrial area. Finally, from the perspective of technology, legislative framework and support policy, circular technology inventory, integrated waste management system, information platform and national subsidies are needed to support the ever-improvement of IS promotion in China's iron/steel industry. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Industrial symbiosis (IS) could generate both economic and environmental benefits in clustered industries and communities. This research shed light on how industrial symbiosis contributes to city's low-carbon development. An urban-level hybrid physical input and monetary output (HPIMO) model which covers physical energy inputs and air pollutants emissions, is established for addressing case study in a Chinese typical industrial city (Liuzhou). Based on current energy consumption and industrial symbiosis and the application of HPIMO model, scenarios related to industrial symbiosis, including waste plastics recycling, scrap tires recycling, flying ash recycling and biomass utilization are explored. Results show that compared with business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, IS can reduce solid wastes and further contribute to the co-benefits of energy saving, CO2 emissions reduction and air pollutants reduction. The finding is critical for national low-carbon strategy. Finally, policy implications to support the ever-improvement of IS promotion in China are proposed and discussed. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Industry and fossil fuel combustion are the main sources for urban carbon emissions. Most studies focus on energy consumption emission reduction and energy efficiency improvement. Material saving is also important for carbon emission reduction from a lifecycle perspective. IS (Industrial symbiosis) and UrS (urban symbiosis) have been effective since both of them encourage byproduct exchange. However, quantitative carbon emission reduction evaluation on applying them is still lacking. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to fill such a gap through a case study in Kawasaki Eco-town, Japan. A hybrid LCA model was employed to evaluate to the lifecycle carbon footprint. The results show that lifecycle carbon footprints with and without IS and UrS were 26.66Mt CO2e and 30.92Mt CO2e, respectively. The carbon emission efficiency was improved by 13.77% with the implementation of IS and UrS. The carbon emission reduction was mainly from \"iron & steel\" industry, cement industry and \"paper making\" industry, with figures of 2.76Mt CO2e, 1.16Mt CO2e and 0.34Mt CO2e, respectively. Reuse of scrape steel, blast furnace slag and waste paper are all effective measures for promoting carbon emission reductions. Finally, policy implications on how to further promote IS and UrS are presented. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "SummaryIndustrial symbiosis (IS) exchanges have been recognized to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, though methods for quantification of GHG emissions in IS exchanges are varied, and no standardized methods are available. This article proposes a practical approach to quantify total and allocated GHG emissions from IS exchanges by integrating the GHG protocol and life cycle assessment. The proposed method expands the system boundaries to include all IS companies, and the functional flow is set to be the sum of the main products. The total impact of a company is allocated to the main product. Three by-product impact allocation methods of cutoff, avoidance, and 50/50 are proposed, and the total and distributed impacts of the IS systems in an industrial park are theoretically derived. The proposed method was tested to quantify GHG reduction in a real IS exchange developed between Korea Zinc (a zinc smelter) and Hankook Paper (a paper mill company) in the Ulsan Eco-Industrial Park initiative. The total reduction of GHG emissions in this IS exchange, 60,522 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, was the same in the GHG protocol, whereas GHG distribution between two companies depended on the allocation method. Given that the reduction of GHG emissions from IS exchanges is the product of the collaboration of giving companies and receiving companies, the 50/50 allocation method is best from an equivalent-responsibility and benefit-sharing perspective. However, this study suggests a more practical implementation approach based on a flexible and negotiable method of allocating the total GHG reduction between stakeholders.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Energy depletion and global climate change have stimulated the Korean government to strengthen energy saving and efficiency measures in all sectors. However, in industrial sector where huge energy is consumed, only small portions of the high-grade waste heat from industrial processes have been utilized by another process through industrial symbiosis networks in industrial park and large quantities of low-grade waste heat are mostly discharged into the environment. Through technological assessment of energy balance between waste heat source in industrial park and heat sink in industrial park and urban area, this study systematically develops an industrial-urban symbiosis (I-US) and conducts a co-benefit analysis for 4 scenarios. Based on the investigation on the energy utilization status of Ulsan, the scenarios for potential I-US networks are evaluated. For the supply and demand side, potential energy sources and sinks are estimated at 49,321 and 15,424\u00a0TJ/yr, respectively, noting that the demand side considered four scenarios based on the local condition analysis. Through these scenarios for the energy symbiosis networks; a reduction of 243,396\u00a0ton/yr CO 2  emission and 48 million US Dollar/yr fuel cost were achieved. Due to a large transition cost for a district heating system, I-US public private partnership business model is highly recommended to attract long-term investment and institutional incentives of carbon credit and energy service companies fund are conducive to put these scenarios into practice.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   One proposed strategy to solve current environmental challenges is industrial and urban symbiosis (I/UrS); however, appropriate evaluation methods are needed so that the potential benefits of I/UrS can be quantified. Several evaluation methods have been applied separately to study I/UrS, but no integrated studies have been conducted by applying different methods in the same case study area. Therefore, this study aimed to establish a comprehensive framework to evaluate I/UrS by combining the material flow analysis (MFA), carbon footprint (CF) and emergy methods. First, we developed a unified database and step-by-step process to clarify the waste distribution and recycling processes in an industrial city. Then a baseline scenario and an I/UrS scenario were set up to define the baselines and effects of I/UrS and compare the results. Finally, the three methods were applied to identify physical features in the I/UrS system. The MFA-based results showed that the use of I/UrS led to a 6.4% reduction in the physical value of material use. The CF-based results indicated that reduction of waste and by-products results in a 13.8% reduction in CO 2 e emissions. The emergy-based results showed that, with the implementation of I/UrS, the value of the emergy sustainability index (excluding labor and services) improved greatly (a 49.2% emergy reduction) as compared with the baseline case (a 14.3% reduction). In addition, the effects of implementing I/UrS by waste and by-product exchanges for blast furnace slag, scrap steel, waste paper, and waste plastic were evaluated. Whereas the CF reductions of unit ton of blast furnace slag is relatively low, emergy reductions of that is comparatively high. If policymakers only consider CF results when addressing the issue of climate change, the effects on emergy will be underestimated in this case. We conclude that the main actors in this area release huge emissions, but they also have a high potential to reduce their environmental loads. In addition, with appropriate designs, waste paper and plastics recycling could be highly efficient. Finally, the integration of the three evaluation methods should contribute to creating a low carbon and more resource independent society.",

        "abstract": "There is a dilemma for rapid industrializing China to balance economic growth and low carbonization. Industrial symbiosis (IS) provides a system innovation to utilize the industry to fight climate change and pursue sustainable urban development, while few attentions are paid in literatures. Under this circumstance, this study reviews the low-carbon city practice in China and conducts a case study to calculate the CO2 emissions reduction potential under promoting IS projects in two cities of China, named Jinan and Liuzhou. With the real national project in Jinan as advanced example, new scenarios related to IS are designed for Liuzhou, including comprehensive energy network, waste plastics recycling, scrap tires recycling and flying ash recycling. The material/waste and energy exchange is quantified in the IS network, as well as the related environmental benefit. The material/energy exchange is over 10 million ton and 20 thousands tce in Jinan's case, and 2.5 million ton and 45 thousand tce in Liuzhou's case. Results highlight that IS could effectively reduce CO2 emissions. The total reduction potential amounts to 3944.05 thousands tCO2/year and 2347.88 thousands tCO2/year in Jinan and Liuzhou. Finally, policy implications on the ever-improvement of industrial symbiosis and China's sustainable urban development are proposed and discussed. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Industrial symbiosis is the sharing of services, utility, and by-product resources among industries. This is usually made in order to add value, reduce costs, and improve the environment, and therefore has been taken as an effective approach for developing an eco-industrial park, improving resource efficiency, and reducing pollutant emission. Most conventional evaluation approaches ignored the contribution of natural ecosystem to the development of industrial symbiosis and cannot reveal the interrelations between economic development and environmental protection, leading to a need of an innovative evaluation method. Under such a circumstance, we present an emergy analysis-based evaluation method by employing a case study at Shenyang Economic and Technological Development Zone (SETDZ). Specific emergy indicators on industrial symbiosis, including emergy savings and emdollar value of total emergy savings, were developed so that the holistic picture of industrial symbiosis can be presented. Research results show that nonrenewable inputs, imported resource inputs, and associated services could be saved by 89.3, 32.51, and 15.7 %, and the ratio of emergy savings to emergy of the total energy used would be about 25.58 %, and the ratio of the emdollar value of total emergy savings to the total gross regional product (GRP) of SETDZ would be 34.38 % through the implementation of industrial symbiosis. In general, research results indicate that industrial symbiosis could effectively reduce material and energy consumption and improve the overall eco-efficiency. Such a method can provide policy insights to industrial park managers so that they can raise appropriate strategies on developing eco-industrial parks. Useful strategies include identifying more potential industrial symbiosis opportunities, optimizing energy structure, increasing industrial efficiency, recovering local ecosystems, and improving public and industrial awareness of eco-industrial park policies.",

Past research illustrated that economic and environmental benefits appear self-evident, although detailed quantification has only been attempted of symbioses for energy and water utilities. This article provides a complimentary case studyfor Kawasaki, Japan. The 14 documented symbioses connect steel, cement, chemical, and paperfirms and their spin-off recycling businesses. Seven key material exchanges divert annually at least 565 000 tons of waste from incineration or landfill. Four of these collectively present an estimated economic opportunity of 13.3 billion JPY (approximately 130 million USD) annually. Five symbioses involve utilization of byproduct and two sharing of utilities. The others are traditional or new recycling industries that do not specifically benefit from geographic proximity. The synergistic effect of urban and industrial symbiosis is unique. The legislative framework for a recycling-oriented society has contributed to realization of the symbioses, as has the availability of government subsidies through the Eco-Town program.",

The program established 26 Eco-Towns around Japan. Approximately 1.65 billion USD was invested in 61 innovative recycling projects, with an average government subsidy of 36%. In addition at least 107 other recycling facilities have been constructed without government subsidy. 14 Eco-Towns primarily contributed to improving industry's productivity, whilst 10 Eco-Towns primarily contributed to improving environmental amenity. In 16 Eco-Towns the private sector was the most important actor supporting local government in the realisation of the Eco-Town, whilst in 9 Eco-Towns this was civil society. The availability of investment subsidies, the coming into force of ambitious recycling legislation with quantified, product-specific targets, access to the significant technological resources of the private sector, and widespread recognition of the urgency to act on environmental issues, all contributed to the success of the Eco-Town Program.",

        "abstract": "As an energy intensive industry, China's iron/steel industry faces the challenge of energy conservation and carbon emission reduction. Energy efficiency, especially residual heat recovery is a critical issue. China is promoting a circular economy strategy in the iron/steel industry, technology upgrading and industrial symbiosis make the material and energy flows more complicated. In order to quantify the energy flows and the related residual heat recovery and carbon emission mitigation potential, this study proposes a hybrid material and energy flow analysis approach at company level. We analyze the material based energy flow routes and the transformation rules. Then, we develop an evaluation index to evaluate the specific energy consumption (SEC) and direct carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (DCE). Furthermore, a case study is conducted in a 10 million ton/year steelmaking plant in northern China. Results verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach. According to the results, the residual heat and carbon emission is mapped out graphically. Results highlight that the case company has 4.87GJ/tons of crude steel residual heat recovery potential, equal to 26.08% of the total energy consumption. Finally, policy implications on the ever-improvement of residual heat utilization and the future research concerns are proposed and discussed. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "CO2 mitigation strategies in industrial parks are a significant component of the Chinese climate change mitigation policy, and industrial symbiosis can provide specific CO2 mitigation opportunity. Technology is important to support symbiosis, but few studies in China have focused on this topic at the industrial park level. This research presented a case study in a national iron and steel industrial park in China. Focus was given onto carbon mitigation through industrial symbiosis technology using substance flow analysis (SFA). Three typical iron and steel industry technologies, including coke dry quenching (CDQ), combined cycle power plant (CCPP), and CO2 capture by slag carbonization (CCSC) were evaluated with SFA. Technology assessment was further conducted in terms of carbon mitigation potential and unit reduction cost. Compared with the Business as usual (BAU) scenario, application with CDQ, CCPP, and CCSC reduced the net carbon emissions by 56.18, 134.43, and 222.89kg CO2 per ton crude steel inside the industrial parks, respectively, including both direct and indirect emissions. Economic assessment revealed that the unit costs for the three technologies were also high, thereby necessitating national financial support. Finally, relevant policy suggestions and future concerns were proposed and discussed. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "title": "Reconsidering brownfield redevelopment strategy in China's old industrial zone: a health risk assessment of heavy metal contamination.",
        "abstract": "Urban environmental quality in brownfield redevelopment sites is of vital importance after most of former industrial areas were replanned or changed into residential and recreational areas. Hence, it is necessary to rethink if those brownfield redevelopment sites have been cleaned up so that there will be no negative health impacts to local residents. Under such a circumstance, this paper aims to evaluate the contamination level of heavy metals within a brownfield redevelopment site in China, namely, the Tiexi old industrial zone in Shenyang. Surface soil and dust samples were collected from local industrial sites, residential/commercial sites, traffic sites, and recreational sites, respectively. Our analysis results revealed that although the soils in the brownfield redevelopment sites had been treated and remediated, heavy metal pollution still exists in certain sites, especially in the current industrial sites that will be planned into residential/commercial or recreational zones, and the current residential sites where the former industrial sites located, showing that past industrial activities did and will continue to influence the soil quality. Further health risk assessment indicates that As and Pb generated from industrial sites and traffic sites has a potential to pose serious health risks to local residents, especially children. The hotspots with more serious health risks to children are mainly concentrated in the areas close to the former Shenyang Smelting Plant. After one decade of redevelopment, the Tiexi old industrial zone has become a new urban area which is not suitable for large-scaled soil remediation efforts. Thus, the phytoremediation by trees or herbs in heavy-metal-contaminated land is more appropriate and should be embedded into urban green land planning. This study provides innovative policy insights on urban brownfield redevelopment to both governmental officials and related stakeholders so that they can make appropriate remediation actions.",

By linking municipal solid waste management (MSWM) with local industries, i.e., urban symbiosis, new symbiotic opportunities can be generated from the geographic proximity of urban and industrial areas, transferring physical resources from urban refuse directly to industrial applications and improving the overall eco-efficiency of the city as a whole. Using a case study of Kawasaki, this paper simulates and evaluates an innovative waste management initiative in Kawasaki by an scenario simulation model based on the LCA approach. Results show that recycling mixed paper, mixed plastics, and organic wastes and utilizing the recycled materials in industrial production will potentially reduce about 69\u00a0kt CO 2 (e) emissions and 8\u00a0kt incineration ashes to be landfilled in 2015. To achieve these outcomes, the total additional cost compared with the current practice is about 1.2 billion JPY.",

        "abstract": "With rapid development, increasing sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission becomes a key environmental issue in China. To respond to this challenge, the Chinese government established a top-down scheme to reduce its SO2 emissions. However, regional disparity and the associated cost differences brought uncertainties to the policy effectiveness and efficiency. Few studies focus on this field. Therefore, this study tries to fill such a gap by investigating the differences of SO2 emissions, reduction potential, and cost-effectiveness through use of the GAINS-China model in five mega-cities in China, namely, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, and Hong Kong. A scenario analysis approach is employed, focusing on two technologies named flue gas desulfurization (FGD) and limestone injection (LINJ). Results demonstrated that a large SO2 reduction potential exists, as well as a great disparity, among the five mega-cities. Chongqing had the largest reduction potential with lowest unit cost, while Beijng and Hong Kong showed the lowest reduction potential with higher unit cost. In Beijing and Shanghai, FGD and LINJ in the power generation sector had the larger reduction potential with the highest cost-effectiveness. However, in Chongqing, the industry sectors also had large reduction potentials. Finally, appropriate SO2 control strategies and policies are raised by considering the local realities. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The amount and cost of wood biomass produced from the Kushida River basin in Japan were simulated under current and modified forestry scenarios by combining the forest ecosystem and cost calculation models at semi-compartment level; in addition, an analysis was carried out comparing the sustainable supply against heat demands in the basin. The forest ecosystem model (BGC-ES) simulates biomass growth, the effects of thinning and clear-cutting practices, and the amount of harvest from these practices. The cost calculation model estimates the cost of each stage of wood biomass production, which depends on the productivity of forestry machines and the forest location. The available amount was determined by an economic comparison between the energy density of wood chips and fossil fuel. The available wood chips were assumed to be converted to heat at a boiler plant. The current forestry scenario (thinning schedule, rotation length, and managed area) was not efficient for the production of wood chips. The economic available amount was <1 % of the potential production from the basin forests. Modified scenarios (arranging the thinning schedule to promote secondary growth, increasing the rotation length, and increasing the managed area) improved the economic availability of the basin forest (up to about 40 %). In these scenarios, the available amount indicated that saturation was determined by the maximum cost of the wood chips. The available amount of wood chip production that can be sustainably supplied by the basin forest was simulated and compared with the household and agricultural demands for heat in the basin.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Energy shortage and global climate change have created a dilemma in Japan, especially after the great earthquake of 2011 in eastern Japan. District Heating System (DHS) using waste heat is highlighted as an attractive solution. However, because of low heat demand in urban areas and the geographic separation of industries, popularizing this solution is considerably difficult in Japan. Previous studies have focused on technical improvements on existing district heating networks, but these studies lack sufficient discussion on an early-stage integrated land-use planning. Supported by technological assessment and emerging concepts of Industrial-Urban Symbiosis (I-US), this study combines the system development of DHS and land use scenarios into a symbiotic design based on inventory survey and geographic database, and conducts a cost-benefit analysis to scientifically and quantitatively evaluate the effects brought from land-use policies. Results from a case study of Shinchi Town in the Fukushima Prefecture indicate DHS using waste heat can realize significant benefits of energy saving and CO 2  reduction, provided positive guidance on land use planning is implemented. Moreover, the model framework of this study also supports a quantitative assessment on policy implementation to help in decision making on urban sustainable energy planning.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Innovative and efficient use of municipal solid waste as a source of energy is an important way to promote the transition to low-carbon cities. One key strategy to improve energy efficiency is to create a network of multiple sectors that can produce and utilize energy from waste. This mechanism has already been adopted at the urban scale in several developed countries as a way to enhance environmental efficiency and reduce adverse impacts. However, to use waste efficiently, it is necessary to examine the supply chain of wastes as a source of materials with potential to generate energy. Such an examination can inform the design of an efficient waste-to-energy process that will create a symbiosis between industry and the waste management sector. In this paper, we describe a model that evaluates energy recovery efficiency by considering the costs and benefits of an innovative waste-to-energy system. In the model, we also consider the material and energy flow of wastes in accordance with the quantity and quality of waste emissions, the separation system, treatment technologies and combinations thereof, and energy recovery and use in other sectors. The scenario was designed by identifying waste management options, including waste quantity/quality; the separation system; the treatment technology model for wet or dry methane fermentation; incineration; a combined system that involves superheating with exchanging heat between the incineration plant and fermenter; and use of refuse paper and plastic fuel (RPF). The results revealed that energy recovery efficiency was most dependent on the effective use of RPF with a relatively high lower heating value and superheating of boiler steam by methane gas in the combined system. An important conclusion was that the most efficient system was a combined system in which paper, plastic, and RPF were separated from 80% of the waste, and 20% of the waste was incinerated and used for wet methane fermentation. The amounts of energy recovered from that system was 54.5 kWh/t, and the efficiency was 33.4%. Analytical results indicated that it is possible to create the critical technology and to develop policy insights needed to make efficient waste management systems for the transition to low-carbon cities.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Energy conservation is critical for promoting urban low-carbon and sustainable development. Because a large amount of heat energy is wasted during energy conversion and transportation, the recovery of waste heat and its cascading use would substantially save resources and reduce CO 2  emissions. As a typical case of the Tokyo Metropolitan Area, direct extracting steam from incinerators for industrial use is considered more efficient than power generation, but hard to be popularized because of long distance heat transport. On the basis of the heat atlas, this study develops an integrated model to assess the feasibility of developing heat exchange network between incineration facilities and industries in city scale, and evaluates the impacts from land use on economic and environmental indices. The result reveals that maximum 45.2% of the incineration waste heat can be utilized to cover 13.8% of the heat consumption in industries, where annual net benefit and CO 2  emission reduction could achieve 63 billion JPY (\u22480.6 billion USD) and 2200\u00a0kt CO 2 /year, respectively. However, current geographic separation between incineration facilities and industries brings a dilemma between economic and environmental benefits which will obstruct the popularization of waste heat exchange. Given this result, a cluster map to classify involved incineration facilities is provided which helps in establishing a renewal strategy considering positive land use adjustment. These results are also referable in urban planning integrated with distributed energy system as well as provide a case for promoting Urban Symbiosis.",

For this research, we utilized the Database for the Energy Consumption of Commercial Buildings (DECC), which provided data on the individual buildings. The existing energy consumption pattern derived from the individual building data seems to have large variations depending on climatic conditions. Therefore, in this research, connections were made between the seasonal fluctuations in energy consumption as well as the seasonal temperature changes, in order to extract the components of variation due to temperature, and make a regional comparison. In addition, we prepared estimating equations for the energy consumption based on temperature. By applying the regional temperature data to these equations, the impact of temperature alone was extracted for comparison. The results showed that, for the types of buildings addressed in this research, even though there is a regionality to the ratio of increments during summer and winter with regard to heating and cooling, it is offset by summing them up. In this research, we were able to roughly determine the level of fluctuations in the energy consumption as an impact of temperature.",

A coupled urban canopy/building energy model (CM-BEM) was utilized to simulate the effectiveness of green roofs. The amount of water needed for evapotranspiration was calculated by using latent heat flux, which was derived from the results of roof surface heat balance calculations. The effect of green roofs on CO2 emissions was determined based on their effectiveness to reduce the energy demand for space cooling, calculated by air-conditioning load simulation. We calculated the CO2 emissions from powering the pumps and the use of tap water, when the necessary amount of water was supplied by watering. Finally, the relationships between amount of water, UHI mitigation, and CO2 emissions were determined.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Industrial parks have been adopted as one way to promote industrial development in China since the early 1980s. However, most of current performance evaluation indicators highlight the maximization of industrial yield, leading to both ecological degradation and environmental pollution due to intensive industrial activities. Therefore, it is critical to develop appropriate evaluation indicators so that industrial parks can move toward sustainable development. This paper aims to fill such a research gap by developing innovative emergy indicators. Kaya formula and index decomposition analysis (IDA) were integrated together in order to quantify the key factors influencing the sustainability of an industrial park. Tianjin Economic Development area (TEDA), the largest industrial park in terms of its economic scale in China, was chosen as one case study area for testing the related methods. The results show that during the period of 2006\u20132010 the sustainability of TEDA experienced a declining trend. From the Kaya formula and IDA analysis, indicators on economic efficiency of process, economic return on investment, renewable empower density and nonrenewable empower density were calculated. Such research findings provide valuable policy insights to the industrial park managers so that they can prepare appropriate development strategies for achieving sustainable development of their industrial parks by considering the local realities.",

In order to provide appropriate water mitigation policies a regional study is completed. Under this circumstance, Liaoning Province, a typical heavy industrial province in north China is chosen as a case study region. The input-output analysis method is employed in order to evaluate the water footprint both from production and consumption perspectives. The results show that the total water footprint of Liaoning in 2007 was 7.30 billionm(3), a 84.6% of internal water footprint and a 15.4% external water footprint. The water trade balance of Liaoning was 2.68 billionm(3), indicating that Liaoning was a net water export region, although water shortages are becoming a more serious concern. The \"Agriculture\" and \"Food and beverage production\" sectors are found to have the highest water footprint, water intensity, water exports, and water trade balance. Based upon Liaoning realities policy implications and suggestions are made, including industrial and trade structure adjustment, application of water efficient technology and management measures, and appropriate capacity-building efforts. The methodology and findings may be useful for investigation of water footprints throughout various regions of the world.",

        "abstract": "In order to improve the overall sustainability of industrial parks, it is necessary to understand the development characteristics of industrial parks so that appropriate management measures can be raised. Under such a circumstance, this study analyzes the changes in the environmental performance of Shenyang Economic and Technology Development Zone (SETDZ) in terms of emergy\u2010based indicators and explores underlying driving forces using decomposition analysis methods. The results show that in the industrial recruitment stage (2001\u20132006), the total emergy increased rapidly and the sustainability level decreased significantly because of the exploitation of local resources with the expansion of industrial scale. After entering the industrial cluster and upgrading stage (2007\u20132010), the total emergy increased even faster, while the environmental performance did not decrease too much because of the improved resource efficiency and improved technological progress. The implementation of industrial symbiosis (IS) (2011\u20132013) could have further effectively reduced the total emergy consumption and improved the environmental performance, but current symbiosis efforts were not sufficient and need to be further promoted. Gross regional product and area of the industrial park were the most important driving factors to the total emergy for all the development stages. In terms of emergy sustainability, renewable emergy ratio (R1/U) was one key impact factor. Therefore, how to improve the ratio of renewable resources and enhance IS scopes will be the key strategies for its sustainable development.",

        "title": "Exploring impact of carbon tax on China\u2019s CO2 reductions and provincial disparities",
        "abstract": "With fast development, it is not easy for China to achieve carbon reduction targets only by traditional command and control measures (e.g., the measures for energy-efficiency). Carbon tax is advocated as one effective complementary measure and has high possibility to be implemented for China\u2019s future low carbon development. Under such a circumstance, this paper aims at forecasting the possible impact of carbon tax on both carbon reduction and economic loss of 30 Chinese provinces. A 30-Chinese-province CGE (Computational general equilibrium) model has been developed to conduct the provincial evaluation, and seven scenarios including Business-as-Usual (BaU) scenario and six carbon tax scenarios with carbon price from 20 USD/ton to 120 USD/ton up to 2030 are set. The results show that China\u2019s industrial CO2 will be reduced from 12.2 billion tons under BaU scenario to 10.4 billion tons, 9.3 billion tons, 8.5 billion tons, 7.9 billion tons, 7.4 billion tons and 7.0 billion tons under scenarios of TAX20, TAX40, TAX60, TAX80, TAX100 and TAX120 in 2030, respectively. Electricity, Metal and Chemicals sectors have high reduction potentials and are priority sectors for carbon tax policy. Provincial disparity analysis demonstrates that coal production/consumption and total energy consumption are key factors to affect carbon tax effect on CO2 reduction, and Inner Mongolia, Shandong, Shanxi and Hebei have the largest industrial CO2 reduction potentials after levying carbon tax. However, the implementation of carbon tax will impede economic development for all provinces. Therefore, the concept of carbon tax efficiency is further proposed in order to evaluate the effectiveness of carbon tax by considering both CO2 reduction and GDP loss. Policy suggestions indicate that provinces of Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Hebei and Anhui should be set priority when implementing carbon tax policy in China, and carbon price should be no more than 50 USD/ton.",

        "title": "Emergy-based sustainability assessment on natural resource utilization in 30 Chinese provinces",
        "abstract": "Abstract   China is experiencing rapid development and suffering from resource depletion and increasing environmental emissions. It is necessary to identify the key patterns of resource use in different Chinese regions so that more appropriate solutions can be raised. Under such a circumstance, the aim of this paper is to scientifically measure and evaluate the sustainability of natural resources utilization of 30 Chinese provinces for the year of 2007 by adopting a bio-perspective method-emergy analysis. After referring to the traditional emergy accounting method, several emergy-based indicators were established to evaluate resource flows, structure, efficiency and the overall sustainable level of different Chinese regions. Furthermore, by employing GIS technology, spatial distribution of natural resources was presented to illustrate emergy consumption with various regional characteristics in 30 Chinese provinces, which may help better understand regional disparities of resource utilization. The results show that regions with most emergy consumption include Shanxi (2.07E+24sej) and Shandong (2.07E+24sej), and most regions with higher resource consumption locate in east China, while less developed region Qinghai has the highest sustainability level, with ESI being 44.82. Another key finding is that renewable resources were very important to sustainability development, and a large amount of consumption on non-renewable resources led to higher environmental press on local and surrounding ecosystems. Sustainable resource use can only be achieved by reducing total resource use, encouraging technology innovation, initiating institutional reform and preparing region-specific development strategies.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid economic development and urbanization, household consumption has played an important role in energy consumption and carbon emissions. This study selects the front-runner developed city Shanghai as a case study to investigate the effects of household consumption pattern on its energy consumption and carbon emissions by employing a CGE (Computable General Equilibrium) model. The results show that Shanghaiu0027s historical carbon emissions related to household consumption present an increasing trend for years of 2002, 2005 and 2007. Moreover, the indirect carbon emissions from household consumption are higher than the direct emissions. The CGE simulation shows that the household consumption, energy consumption, carbon emissions, output of industry, Shanghaiu0027s foreign trade would continue to increase until 2030, and the low-carbon oriented household consumption would save 65 million ton of coal equivalent (or 39%) energy and 39.4 million ton (or 40%) of carbon emissions compared to the high-carbon scenario. Furthermore, due to the pattern change of household consumption, resource patterns embedded in Shanghaiu0027s foreign trade would present net import in the future.",

        "abstract": "The circular economy (CE) concept was introduced in China to address environmental degradation and resource scarcity associated with rapid economic development. Chosen as a demonstration city, Dalian has implemented the CE strategy as a means of conserving water, materials, energy and land. This paper outlines some of the regional CE initiatives that have been successful to date in Dalian, including those focusing on conserving energy and water resources and others focusing on reduced industrial emissions. The paper details the approach used in implementing the CE concept in Dalian, tracing the foci and goals of the program, and the sectoral approach used to implement a CE. Although Dalian municipality has achieved many successes in implementing a CE, our paper identifies several challenges that, until recently, have held back complete implementation. These include: the lack of incentives for older industries to 'green' their operations, the lack of financial support to expand the CE concept, and a broad-based need for heightened public awareness and participation in CE initiatives. Our paper then identifies several responses by Dalian municipality to overcome these challenges, including pricing and tax reforms that serve as conservation incentives, the provision of financial support for CE promotion through budget reorganization, and the organization of CE training programs. Our paper concludes that, although CE initiatives have been successful in Dalian, more is possible and more is needed before Dalian can be designated a true 'eco-city'. The approach used by Dalian can provide guidance for other Chinese cities, although it is recognized that each city must tailor its own approach for differing contexts and conditions.",

        "title": "The effects of carbon reduction on sectoral competitiveness in China: A case of Shanghai",
        "abstract": "The Chinese government has committed to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions per unit gross domestic product by 60\u201365% from 2005 levels by 2030. In order to achieve this commitment, various measures should be taken. Due to the complex relationship between carbon emission and economic development, it is critical to quantify the impacts of different measures. Under such a circumstance, this paper is to identify the effects of carbon tax on the sectoral competitiveness in Shanghai by 2030 under unequal imposition of carbon tax between Shanghai and the rest of China by using a two-region dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Research results show that different carbon tax rates in different regions would affect GDP of Shanghai and the outcomes are different under different scenarios. In general, a lower carbon tax rate can lead to a higher output and these output changes could further influence the sectoral competitiveness. Under the tax44 scenario, sectors such as agriculture, textile, transport equipment, and electronics are the winners in Shanghai, with outputs increased by 2.02%, 1.47%, 1.08% and 3.05%, respectively; while food production, petrol oil, chemicals and non-metal are the losers, with outputs decreased by 2.02%, 0.87%, 0.03% and 2.39%, respectively. This study also reveals that price and scale effects are the key factors influencing the changes of sectoral outputs. Such findings provide useful insights to those policy makers to allocate appropriate carbon reduction targets to different regions.",

        "title": "The potential environmental gains from recycling waste plastics: simulation of transferring recycling and recovery technologies to Shenyang, China.",
        "abstract": "With the increasing attention on developing a low-carbon economy, it is necessary to seek appropriate ways on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through innovative municipal solid waste management (MSWM), such as urban symbiosis. However, quantitative assessments on the environmental benefits of urban symbiosis, especially in developing countries, are limited because only a limited number of planned synergistic activities have been successful and it is difficult to acquire detailed inventory data from private companies. This paper modifies and applies a two-step simulation system and used it to assess the potential environmental benefits, including the reduction of GHG emissions and saving of fossil fuels, by employing various Japanese plastics recycling/energy-recovery technologies in Shenyang, China. The results showed that among various recycling/energy-recovery technologies, the mechanical waste plastics recycling technology, which produces concrete formwork boards (NF boards), has the greatest potential in terms of reducing GHG emissions (1.66 kg CO(2)e/kg plastics), whereas the technology for the production of refuse plastic fuel (RPF) has the greatest potential on saving fossil fuel consumption (0.77 kg ce/kg-plastics). Additional benefits can be gained by applying combined technologies that cascade the utilization of waste plastics. Moreover, the development of clean energy in conjunction with the promotion of new waste plastics recycling programs could contribute to additional reductions in GHG emissions and fossil fuel consumption.",

        "abstract": "Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) in China warrants particular attention as China has become the largest MSW generator in the world and the total amount of MSW it produces continues to increase. In recent years, central and local governments have made great efforts to improve MSWM in China. New regulations and policies have been issued, urban infrastructure has been improved, and commercialization and international cooperation have been encouraged. Considering these developments, an overview is necessary to analyze the current state as well as new opportunities and challenges regarding MSWM in China. This paper shows that since the late 1990s, the amount of MSW collected has been largely decoupled from economic growth and incineration has become an increasingly widespread treatment method for MSW. We identify and discuss four major challenges and barriers related to China's MSWM, and propose an integrated management framework to improve the overall eco-efficiency of MSWM.",

        "abstract": "Innovative waste recycling through industrial processes such as industrial and urban symbiosis has long been practiced and recently received much attention in the field of industrial ecology, with researchers making efforts to identify key contributing factors to successful industrial symbiosis. By analyzing 88 sample recycling projects in 23 eco-towns in Japan, this article focuses on the factors of project scale, recycling boundary, and types of waste in relationship to environmental benefits and operational performance. The results showed that larger eco-towns achieved more savings of virgin materials and higher stability in operation. Large-scale projects tended to locate closer to the users of recycled products than did small-scale projects. For treating similar types of waste, projects producing recycled products for special users (e.g., feedstock to a blast furnace for iron production) tended to locate closer to the users than those not producing for special users. The type of waste had a strong effect on the savings of virgin materials and recycling boundaries, while local factors had significant impacts on operational performance. The results also showed that agglomeration did not significantly contribute to the environmental benefits or operational performance of eco-town projects. Another finding was that national agencies were helpful for facilitating cross-prefecture transportation and long-distance transaction of wastes. Implications of the findings are also discussed. \u00a9 2012 by Yale University.",

        "title": "Determining optimal resource recycling boundary at regional level: A case study on Tokyo Metropolitan Area in Japan.",
        "abstract": "Conventionally, material inputs to industries come from either natural resources or intermediate products. With the increasing attention on greening the industrial process, municipal solid waste (MSW) can be separated and utilized as inputs to large-scale industries. As such, waste flows need to be managed to meet the requirements of industries by considering both quality and scale. Small scales of municipal recycling centers (MRCs) for pre-treating recyclable wastes often lead to higher pre-treatment cost and lower recycling efficiencies. Theoretically, appropriate facility scale and recycling boundary should be based upon a balanced consideration between economies of scale and transportation costs. However, only a few empirical studies on recycling boundaries have been conducted. Existing modeling studies are mostly case studies for planning purposes and do not theoretically examine the mechanisms and factors that determine recycling boundary. Under such a circumstance, this paper fills such a gap by quantitatively seeking the determinants for recycling boundaries and the related mechanism. An optimization model applying on the recycling of waste plastics is developed and tested in the Tokyo Metropolitan Region (TMR) in Japan. The results indicate two determinants for recycling boundary at the regional level: spatial density of separated wastes and the ratio of unit transportation cost to unit treatment cost. Separated wastes that are collected in low spatial density and have a low ratio of unit transportation cost to unit treatment cost should be better recycled in a large region. The finding implies that regional recycling networks should have multiple layers designed for different types of wastes due to the differences in their spatial density, unit transportation cost and unit treatment cost. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, decarbonization of the power sector, including decommissioning of existing fossil-fuel power plants, aggregation of power plant sites, and capacity augmentation of carbon-free power plants, is necessary to achieve low-carbon societies in the long term. Decarbonization results in declining advantage for industrial symbiosis complexes that rely on fossil-fuel power plants. To establish sustainable industrial symbiosis complexes, we used a quantitative model to analyze optimal locations and scales for power plants in Japan considering CO 2  emissions reduction targets and several demand scenarios. Our results showed that even with a target of 80% CO 2  emission reduction, almost half of Japanu0027s electricity generation could come from fossil-fuel power plants in 2050 if CCS technology were deployed widely. Fossil-fuel power plants would be developed mainly in the regions of high electricity demand and little wind power potential, such as Tokyo, Chubu, and Kansai. From an intra-regional perspective, fossil-fuel power plants could be constructed in areas of high electricity demand. In addition, except for the above areas, generation from fossil-fuel power plants would vary in accordance with the availability of renewables and electricity demand. Our results indicate that future climate policy, regional electricity demand, and availability of regional renewables should be considered when planning the development of industrial symbiosis complexes.",

        "abstract": "In 35 of 70 patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease, two dimensional echocardiography revealed the posterobasal wall of the left ventricle to be entrapped between the left ventricular and atrial cavities and bent inward. The motion of the bending segment was paradoxical. This abnormality was assumed to be induced by the left atrial dilatation extending inferiorly behind the left ventricle, because the length of the bending segment correlation with the left atrial dimension. There was no correlation between the degree of abnormal bending and left atrial pressure, mitral valve pressure gradient or left ventricular dimension. The systolic excursion of the posterobasal wall of the left ventricle was reduced according to the length of the bending segment. This abnormal feature was also observed in five postmortem heart specimens with an extremely dilated left atrium. The macroscopic and microscopic findings in the myocardium of the bending segment were not different from those of the remaining segment of the left ventricle. Therefore, the asynergic motion of the bending segment is assumed to be caused by the abnormal spatial orientation of the left ventricle and the left atrium. It should be considered that the giant left atrium not only oppresses the surrounding organs but also affects the left ventricle.",

        "abstract": "To assess influences of intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP) on superior mesenteric flow, 15 postoperative patients were examined, in whom distal aspects of balloons were distal to the superior mesenteric artery. Superior mesenteric flow velocity-time integral in systole (IntS), that in diastole (IntD), and the sum of IntS and IntD (IntS+IntD) were determined on and off IABP (IABP ON-OFF test). The same parameters were obtained with balloon inflating on every other beat (IABP 1:2 test). The cardiac cycle with balloon inflation during diastole was defined as \"1:2 ON,\" and the cardiac cycle without balloon inflation during diastole was defined as \"1:2 OFF.\" (1) IABP ON-OFF test. IABP increased IntS (p less than 0.01), IntD (p less than 0.01), IntS+IntD (p less than 0.01), and cardiac output (p less than 0.05). The increments in IntS, IntD and IntS+IntD on IABP are attributed largely to an increased in cardiac output. (2) IABP 1:2 test. IntS during 1:2 OFF was greater than IntS during 1:2 ON (p less than 0.01), whereas IntD during 1:2 OFF was smaller than IntD during 1:2 ON (p less than 0.01). There was no significant difference in IntS+IntD between 1:2 ON and 1:2 OFF. These data suggest that juxtamesenteric balloon placement did not interrupt the arterial inflow of a superior mesenteric artery.",

        "abstract": "The mitral inflow method of measuring cardiac output with pulsed Doppler two-dimensional echocardiography was developed and validated against the thermodilution technique in 42 patients. A mitral inflow method combined the velocity of left ventricular inflow at the mitral annulus (apical long-axis view) with the cross-sectional area of the annulus calculated from its diameter (parasternal long-axis view). A good correlation was observed between thermodilution and Doppler measurements of cardiac output (r = 0.93). The ratio of Doppler measurements to thermodilution measurements will be between 0.76 and 1.15 for about 95% of cases. There was a good correlation between percentage change in thermal cardiac output and those in Doppler cardiac output (r = 0.95); the limits of agreement were -11.5% to 10.5%, suggesting that this method can be most useful for assessing relative changes in cardiac output.",

We found that 48 of 264 pediatric patients could not be extubated within 4 days after open-heart surgery because PaO2 was less than 75 torr and PaCO2 was over 45 torr on an inspired oxygen fraction of 0.4. Most of the 48 patients were under 12 months old, had pulmonary hypertension and/or complex cardiac anomalies, and were not hemodynamically stable and/or fully conscious. The intensity of long-term intubation was attributed to cardiovascular or respiratory complications and multiple organ failure. At the time of extubation, water infusion was maintained below 80 ml/kg X day and positive water balance below 15 ml/kg X day. Calories and amino acid were maintained over 70 kcal/kg X day and 1.5 g/kg X day, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Ninety-one patients with tetralogy of Fallot underwent intracardiac repair between 1978 and 1981. One patient died from left-sided heart failure. Retrospective analyses of this death revealed a significant decrease of the left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume index (EDVI) of 21 ml/m2 (36% of normal). Results of early postoperative hemodynamic studies after total correction of this anomaly suggested that an EDVI of 30 ml/m2 is the minimal requirement for adequate cardiac output postoperatively. Based on these data, 3 patients with decreased LV volume with EDVI of around 30 ml/m2 were challenged with the primary repair with success, although they required atrial pacing and catecholamine support postoperatively to maintain adequate left atrial pressure and cardiac output. From these results, it is recommended that patients with tetralogy of Fallot and an EDVI of 30 ml/m2 or more can be considered as candidates for the primary repair, but that patients with an EDVI of less than 30 ml/m2 should be palliated once by systemic-to-pulmonary arterial shunt procedures. Subsequent total correction should be performed after sufficient LV growth for those patients.",

Twenty-four patients were divided into 2 groups; group A had no treatment as control and group B received bolus injection of RH-SOD (35,000 IU/kg) into cardiopulmonary bypass 5 minutes before reperfusion. Arterial and coronary sinus blood was collected to measure chemiluminescence (ChL) value, SOD activity, lactate and pyruvate level, and several parameters of myocardial oxygen metabolism after reperfusion. Arterio-venous difference of ChL value showed the tendency of less ChL generation of the heart in group B compared with those in group A. But no other parameters showed significant difference between the two groups. Our data suggested that this way of the administration of RH-SOD failed to improve the myocardial protection during open heart surgery. Further investigation, such as dose response study, might be required to determine whether RH-SOD possess beneficial effects or not in the clinical setting.",

        "abstract": "Using an isolated working rat heart model, the effects of DL-verapamil, ryanodine, gabexate mesilate (FOY), recombinant human superoxide dismutase (RH-SOD), and coenzyme Q10 upon myocardial protection were evaluated. Under conditions of normothermic ischemia, all these compounds, except RH-SOD, when added to the St. Thomas' cardioplegic solution at an optimal concentration, showed beneficial effects upon functional recovery and enzyme leakage. In contrast, the above compounds, except ryanodine and FOY, failed to improve the protective properties of the St. Thomas' cardioplegic solution under conditions of hypothermic ischemia. Our results indicate that calcium overload via the calcium channel and calcium-induced calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) may contribute to the onset of ischemic-reperfusion injury. However, under conditions of hypothermic ischemia, calcium-induced calcium release from SR plays a dominant role in calcium overload. Furthermore, intracellular calcium overload may activate proteases and result in the acceleration of myocardial injury.",

At present, right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy has been used as the gold standard, however, establishment of noninvasive, simple, and easy diagnostic procedure is desired. The canine donor heart, in which atrial septal defect and tricuspid regurgitation had been produced beforehand, was heterotopically transplanted into the recipient's chest cavity. In seven dogs, two to three mCi of 111In-antimyosin was injected intravenously upon cardiac rejection before the heart was excised. 111In-antimyosin myocardial imaging was then performed using a gamma camera. In the same slice, a histopathological rejection score was calculated and divided into mild, moderate or severe injection. the uptake of 111In-antimyosin was significantly higher in moderate and severe rejected myocardium, since this agent produced a specific and selective localization and concentration in areas of myocardial damage. Therefore, this new technique allows the evaluation of therapeutic intervention upon cardiac rejection and may replace right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy.",

Eight heterotopic heart transplantations using mongrel dogs were performed, and grated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the donor hearts was carried out. High signal intensity was obtained in the rejected myocardium at the time of cardiac rejection, especially from the right ventricular wall to the intraventricular septal wall compared with the left ventricular posterolateral wall. In addition, MRI was performed in the excised heart. High signal intensity was also observed in the same region of the excised donor hearts. The histopathological rejection scores were well in agreement with prolonged T1 and T2 relaxation times; severe and mild rejection of the myocardium were distinguished by the T1 and T2 relaxation times. Our results suggest that MRI is able to visualize the transplanted myocardium undergoing rejection and that the right ventricular wall is more sensitive to cardiac rejection than the left. MRI may allow noninvasive evaluation of the severity and extent of cardiac rejection.",

Six heterotopic heart transplantation models in the peritoneal cavity were prepared with 12 adult mongrel dogs and in vivo imaging of the donor heart was performed using gated magnetic resonance imaging, (MRI) and Gd-DTPA contrast enhancement. In cardiac rejection, high signal intensity was obtained in the rejected myocardium, especially from the right ventricular wall to the intraventricular septal wall. The rejected myocardium was clearly visualized after administration of Gd-DTPA (0.5 mmol/kg body weight) via the femoral vein in all donor hearts. The mean ratios of signal intensity calculated from the rejected and normal myocardium were also increased from 25% to 42% after administration of Gd-DTPA. On the other hand, in the cases with no rejection, whole myocardium was visualized homogeneously before and after Gd-DTPA and there was no high signal intensity. Thus, our method has the potential of assessing the extent and severity of cardiac rejection using gated MRI and Gd-DTPA contrast enhancement.",

Mitral flow velocity-time integral in the rapid filling phase (IntR) and that in the atrial contraction phase (IntA), the sum of IntR and IntA (IntR+IntA), and the ratio of IntA to IntR (IntA/IntR) were calculated with patients on and off balloon pumping (IABP ON-OFF test). IABP increased IntR and IntR+IntA, decreased IntA/IntR, and did not change IntA, suggesting that a decreased afterload or augmented coronary perfusion improves left ventricular relaxation. When the balloon inflated on every other beat (IABP 1:2 test), IntR and IntR+IntA increased without balloon assist, IntA/IntR decreased off IABP, and IntA did not change. The afterload reduction or augmented coronary perfusion on the previous beat with IABP might help ventricular filling on the next beat without balloon assist. A drastic decrease in IntR after IABP stopped indicated the need to continue IABP. Since the change in IntR during IABP ON-OFF test was significantly correlated with that in IntR during IABP 1:2 test, the change in IntR during IABP 1:2 test could help to predict the optimal time of weaning.",

        "abstract": "Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has come to be widely performed for reduced invasiveness; however, its safety in patients with co-morbidities is not fully examined. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of gastric ESD with co-morbidities categorized according to ASA Physical Status Classification.Two hundred and forty patients of ASA 1 (no co-morbidities), 268 of ASA 2 (mild), and 19 of ASA 3 (severe) were treated by ESD for gastric neoplasms. We retrospectively compared clinicopathological features and treatment results of these three groups.Cases (by percent) treated with anticoagulant/platelet agents were more common in the higher ASA grades (ASA 1, 5.8%; ASA 2, 29.1%; ASA 3, 31.6%; P < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in case numbers treated under guideline criteria, curative resection (ASA 1, 79.6%; ASA 2, 79.9%; ASA 3, 78.9%), or complications related to the ESD procedure (e.g., postoperative bleeding, perforation, thermal injury). By a patient risk prediction model on surgery, i.e., P-POSSUM, morbidity was halved, and no patients died compared to a predicted death rate of 0.5-2%; however, total and complications unrelated to ESD procedure (e.g., aspiration pneumonia, ischemic heat attack) were more common in higher ASA grades (ASA 1, ASA 2, ASA 3: 15.4, 23.9, 26.3%, respectively, P = 0.014; 0.4, 7.1, 0%, respectively, P = 0.00087). Deviation rates from clinical pathway were more frequent and hospital stay (days) longer in higher ASA grades (ASA 1, ASA 2, ASA 3: 11.3, 17.9, 26.3%, respectively, P = 0.014; 8, 8, 9%, respectively, P = 0.0053).ESD is an efficient treatment for gastric neoplasms with co-morbidities. However, additional caution is required because co-morbidity is a risk factor for both total complications and complications unrelated to the ESD procedure, and may cause deviations in the clinical course and prolonged hospital stay.",

        "abstract": "Sphincter of Oddi manometry (SOM) is recognized as the standard diagnostic modality for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD). However, SOM is not commonly performed because of its technical difficulty and the high incidence of post-procedural pancreatitis. To diminish post-procedural pancreatitis, we tried to develop a new method of SOM. This study examined the feasibility of SOM with a guide-wire-type manometer, which is commonly used to measure the arterial pressure for coronary angiography, for the assessment of SO motility.A total of 35 procedures were performed in 8 patients with biliary type III SOD and 14 patients with other disease. We performed SOM using the guide-wire-type manometer on SOD cases and other cases [amplitude, duration, frequency and the area under the curve (AUC) of SO contractions].The mean time required for the measurement was 7.5 \u00b1 4.1 min. The amplitude, frequency and AUC of SO contractions were significantly larger in the SOD cases than in other diseases (147.2 vs. 92.8 mmHg, p = 0.042; 10 vs. 5/min, p = 0.007; 2,837 vs. 1,122 mmHg s, p = 0.003, respectively). In 6 patients who underwent endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST), the SO amplitude decreased dramatically after EST. In this study, mild pancreatitis was observed in only one patient.SOM using a guide-wire-type manometer is safe, reliable and easy to apply for the clinical assessment of SO motility. The guide-wire-type manometer may become a new method to measure SO function for the diagnosis of SOD.",

In this study, we tried to reveal the degree of preventive effects of PPDS for each individual risk factor within the high-risk group of PEP using the propensity score analysis.The clinical data of 1131 ERCP practices performed at Kobe University Hospital from April 2006 to February 2009 were collected prospectively. We investigated their clinical characteristics including the risk factors of PEP, the use of PPDS and complications of ERCP. We conducted the stratification analysis using the propensity score matching analysis.In 210 propensity score-matched ERCPs, PPDS proved to be effective in preventing PEP in patients with a history of pancreatitis (odds ratio 0.11, 95% CI 0.01-0.76, P = 0.01) and cases of difficult cannulation (requiring more than 30\u2009min) (odds ratio 0.13, 95% CI 0.01-1.14, P = 0.08).Patients with a history of pancreatitis and cases of difficult cannulation are strongly recommended for PPDS placement. The propensity score analysis can be adapted to the ERCP-related analysis with many procedure-related factors with using retrospective data, and may be adapted to investigate the matters that are unsuitable for RCT by volume and ethical issue.",

        "abstract": "Morphological types and mucin protein expressions classify intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). Main duct (MD)-IPMN mostly consists of intestinal type (I-type), which expresses MUC2. Branch duct (BD)-IPMN mostly consists of gastric type (G-type), which does not express MUC2. However, the definition of mixed-type IPMN has yet to be clarified and it contains various histological types. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between MUC2 expression and the presence of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and invasive carcinoma, especially in mixed-type IPMN.This retrospective study included 101 consecutive patients with surgically resected IPMNs between April 2001 and October 2012. All patients were morphologically classified into four distinct types (I-type, G-type, PB-type: pancreatobilliary, O-type: oncocytic) and immunohistochemical reactivity of various anti-mucin antibodies were investigated.According to the classification of the 2012 international guidelines, the numbers (and histomorphological types: I/G/PB/O) of MD, mixed-type, and BD-IPMNs were 16 (12/4/0/0), 45 (16/28/1/0), and 40 (0/38/1/1). Prevalence of MUC2 expression in MD, mixed-type, and BD-IPMNs were 75% (12/16), 36% (16/45), and 0% (0/40). In mixed-type IPMN, the prevalence of HGD and/or invasive carcinoma in MUC2-positive IPMN was significantly higher than that of MUC2-negative IPMN (HGD + invasive carcinoma: 88% vs. 38%, p = 0.0017; invasive carcinoma: 50% vs. 21%, p = 0.042). Multivariate analysis showed that MUC2 expression is an independent predictive factor of HGD and invasive carcinoma in mixed IPMN (odds ratio 14.6, 95% CI 2.5-87.4, p = 0.003).In mixed-type IPMN, MUC2 expression clearly identified HGD and invasive carcinoma and may provide most appropriate surgical indication.",

We examined the inhibitory effects of chemically synthesized derivatives of curcumin against inflammatory responses and compared them with those of curcumin, in order to find derivatives with stronger effects than curcumin. In a cell culture system using the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7, monoacetylcurcumin strongly inhibited IkappaB phosphorylation, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In addition, oral administration of monoacetylcurcumin to mice led to greater suppression of TNF-alpha production after LPS stimulation than the administration of curcumin or tetrahydrocurcumin in vivo. Monoacetylcurcumin also inhibited the LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation in the liver. Collectively, monoacetylcurcumin is a potential chemopreventive agent for treating inflammatory responses more effectively than curcumin.",

The purpose of the present study was to clarify the clinicopathological characteristics of abnormal micro-lesions of the oro-hypopharynx detected by NBI-ME.Of the 62 lesions detected by NBI-ME, 40 abnormal micro-lesions in 37 patients were removed by endoscopic treatment and were pathologically evaluated. We reviewed the medical records of patients with these lesions and investigated the relationship between NBI-ME findings and pathological findings.Pathological examination revealed the following: high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) in nine (23%) lesions, low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGIN) in 22 (55%), pharyngitis in seven (18%) and papilloma in two (5%). Two NBI-ME findings, high microvascular density (MVD) and a brownish area (BA), were recognized more frequently as the grade of malignancy advanced. The likelihood ratio (confidential interval) for having HGIN in the patients with both MVD and BA was 13 (3.62-127).The pathological diagnosis of abnormal micro-lesions ranged from pharyngitis to HGIN. High MVD and BA may be important findings for grading the malignancy of abnormal micro-lesions.",

We compared clinical characteristics and various lifestyle factors in these three groups.The lifestyle factors significantly associated with NERD compared with findings in the control group were intake of egg (odds ratio [OR] 1.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-3.50), sleep shortage (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.54-3.88), and strong psychological stress (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.18-2.62). In male subjects, current smoking (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.13-3.74; OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.09-3.20) was a significant risk factor for both NERD and EE. Moreover, alcohol >200 kcal/day (OR 3.99, 95% CI 1.03-15.55) and intake of a large quantity of food at supper (OR 7.85, 95% CI 1.66-37.05) were significant risk factors for EE in subjects with hiatal hernia. Intake of a large quantity of food at supper (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.06-4.13) was more common in the NERD group than in the EE group.There were differences in the associated lifestyle factors between patients with NERD and those with EE, and there was also a gender-related difference between these groups.",

Histological examination of the resected pancreas showed a 15-mm in length intraductal growth of carcinoma in situ in the main pancreatic duct, 10mm of which showed microinvasion. There was also atypical hyperplasia at a branch pancreatic duct near the lesion. It was suspected to be an initial stage of pancreatic ductal carcinoma.

        "abstract": "We aimed to elucidate the risk factors and preventive factors associated with chronic low-dose aspirin (L-ASA)-induced gastroduodenal mucosal injury in Japanese patients with arteriosclerotic disease.This retrospective observational study included 400 L-ASA users who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. We investigated patients' clinical characteristics, including age, peptic ulcer history, concomitant drugs [i.e. gastric agents, antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids], abdominal symptoms, endoscopic findings, and interruption of L-ASA before endoscopy. The severity of gastroduodenal mucosal lesions was evaluated using the modified LANZA score (MLS).Of 400 patients, 249 (62%) and 41 (10%) had gastroduodenal mucosal lesions (MLS \u22651) and gastroduodenal ulcers, respectively. Peptic ulcer history, abdominal symptoms, proton pump inhibitor (PPI), histamine type 2-receptor antagonists (H2RA), and the cessation of L-ASA before endoscopy were significantly associated with L-ASA-induced gastroduodenal ulcers; the odds ratio (OR) (confidence interval (CI)) was 5.49 (1.82-16.55), 4.56 (1.93-10.75), 0.12 (0.03-0.42), 0.13 (0.04-0.40) and 0.11 (0.04-0.29), respectively. Moreover, patients having two or more of five factors [i.e. advanced age (\u226575), anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs, NSAIDs and corticosteroids] had a significantly higher prevalence of L-ASA-induced gastroduodenal ulcers [OR (CI): 2.39 (1.002-5.69)].Peptic ulcer history, abdominal symptoms and the summation of risk factors increased the risk for L-ASA-induced gastroduodenal ulcers. H2RAs and PPIs were effective for the prevention of L-ASA-induced gastroduodenal ulcers. The cessation of L-ASA before endoscopy might lead to the underestimation of L-ASA-induced gastroduodenal injury.",

        "abstract": "Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) enables en bloc resection of early gastrointestinal neoplasms; however, most ESD articles report small series, with short-term outcomes performed by multiple operators on single organ. We assessed short- and long-term treatment outcomes following ESD for early neoplasms throughout the gastrointestinal tract.We performed a longitudinal cohort study in single tertiary care referral center. A total of 1,635 early gastrointestinal neoplasms (stomach 1,136; esophagus 138; colorectum 361) were treated by ESD by single operator. Outcomes were complication rates, en bloc R0 resection rates, and long-term overall and disease-specific survival rates at 3 and 5 years for both guideline and expanded criteria for ESD.En bloc R0 resection rates were: stomach: 97.1 %; esophagus: 95.7 %; colorectum: 98.3 %. Postoperative bleeding and perforation rates respectively were: stomach: 3.6 and 1.8 %; esophagus: 0 and 0 %; colorectum: 1.7 and 1.9 %. Intra criteria resection rates were: stomach: 84.9 %; esophagus: 81.2 %; colorectum: 88.6 %. Three-year survival rates for lesions meeting Japanese ESD guideline/expanded criteria were for all organ-combined: 93.4/92.7 %. Five-year rates were: stomach: 88.1/84.6 %; esophagus: 81.6/57.3 %; colorectum: 94.3/100 %. Median follow-up period was 53.4 (range, 0.07-98.6) months. Follow-up rate was 94 % (1,020/1,085). There was no recurrence or disease-related death.In this large series by single operator, ESD was associated with high curative resection rates and low complication rates across the gastrointestinal tract. Disease-specific and overall long-term prognosis for patients with lesions within intra criteria after curative resection appeared to be excellent.",

Endoscopic treatment appears to be desirable for EGC in the remnant stomach because it is less invasive than surgical resection.In this retrospective study, to evaluate the feasibility of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for EGC in an anastomotic site, treatment results of ESD for EGC in an anastomotic site and in remnant stomach not involving an anastomotic site were compared. In total, 11 EGC lesions of anastomotic sites in 11 patients and 22 EGC lesions of remnant stomach not involving an anastomotic site in 21 patients were treated by ESD.All lesions were successfully treated by en bloc resection. There were three patients with perforations in the anastomotic site group. Although resected specimen size and tumor size were larger in the anastomotic site group than in the non-anastomotic site group (P < 0.01), the procedure duration was far longer in the anastomotic site group than in the non-anastomotic site group (P < 0.01). The speed of the procedure was faster in the non-anastomotic site group than in the anastomotic site group (P < 0.05).Although ESD for EGC in an anastomotic site is a time-consuming procedure and requires advanced techniques compared with ESD for EGC not involving an anastomotic site, a high en bloc resection rate was achieved. ESD by endoscopists with sufficient experience appears to be a feasible treatment for EGC in an anastomotic site.",

        "abstract": "Esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has developed in recent years because of its high rate of en bloc resection. However, for many endoscopists, technical difficulty and risks of complications are great barriers to performing esophageal ESD. In this study, we developed an original training model for esophageal ESD using isolated pig esophagus and assessed this ex vivo model in endoscopists with experience in gastric ESD.Three endoscopists without experience in esophageal ESD but with some experience in gastric ESD performed esophageal ESD of artificial lesions in 10 consecutive sessions using this ex vivo model. The en bloc resection rate, operation time, number of muscularis propria layer injuries, and presence of perforation were recorded. We evaluated the effectiveness of this training in the three endoscopists by comparing results from the first five sessions (former period) with those from the last five sessions (latter period).All three endoscopists achieved en bloc resections in all trials. In the former period, injury to the muscularis propria layer for each of the three endoscopists occurred a mean of 2.2 (1-3), 0.6 (0-1), and 3.2 (1-6) times, respectively. Perforation occurred in one session performed by one endoscopist. In the latter period, the mean number of muscularis propria layer injuries for each of the three endoscopists decreased to 0.2 (0-1), 0.2 (0-1), and 0.8 (0-2), respectively. The time of operation shortened from 35.0 (25-40), 36.4 (30-50), and 29.8 (23-43) min to 23.0 (16-31), 25.6 (23-28), and 29.2 (21-37) min, respectively.This original ex vivo training model was helpful to endoscopists with experience in gastric ESD in acquiring the basic skills for performing esophageal ESD.",

        "abstract": "The discovery of novel and effective treatment methods would be of great help to patients with acute pancreatitis. The aims of this study were to determine the inhibitory effects of vitamin K3 (VK3) against cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in mice and to examine the mechanisms behind these effects.Acute pancreatitis in mice was induced by intraperitoneal injection of cerulein 6 times at hourly intervals. Vitamin K3 was administered once before the first injection of cerulein or twice before and after the first injection of cerulein. The degrees of inflammation and autophagy in the pancreatic tissue were estimated by histological examination, measurement of enzyme activity, confocal microscopy, and Western blotting. The inhibitory effects of VK3 against rapamycin-induced autophagy were also examined using HeLa cells stably expressing green fluorescent protein LC3.Cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis was markedly attenuated by the administration of VK3. In addition, VK3 led to the inhibition of cerulein-evoked autophagic changes and colocalization of autophagosomes and lysosomes in the pancreatic tissue. Vitamin K3 also reduced rapamycin-induced autophagy in HeLa/green fluorescent protein LC3 cells.Our data suggest that the administration of VK3 reduces pancreatic inflammation in acute pancreatitis through inhibition of the autophagic pathway. Vitamin K3 may be an effective therapeutic strategy against acute pancreatitis.",

        "abstract": "Recently, early detection and early treatment of the colorectal cancer have been enabled by the improvement of endoscopic diagnosis and introduction of new techniques. In Japan, although Japan Polyp Study is running, there is no standard strategy concerning the post-polypectomy colonoscopic surveillance yet. Post-polypectomy colonoscopic surveillance is so far entrusted to each institute or each gastroenterologist at present.To analyze the present states of the surveillance after polypectomy in Japan, we performed questionary survey and compared them with the results in U.S. and U.S. Multisociety Task Force on colorectal Cancer. A simple random sample of 132 doctors who engaged in a digestive organ disease in plural institutes was obtained.Many doctors recommend surveillance every around 1 year regardless of the kind of the polyp. Doctors in Japan tend to recommend postpolypectomy colonoscopic surveillance more frequently than that recommended U.S. Multisociety Task Force on colorectal Cancer. Furthermore in all types of polyps except for 12 mm tubular adenoma with high grade dysplasia, the majority of doctors in Japan recommend post-polypectomy colonoscopic surveillance more frequently than American doctors. Significant difference was found in surveillance of hyperplastic polyp among doctors with 1 to 5 years experience and those with more than 6 years.It has been shown that surveillance intervals varies substantially in each doctor. The agreement of the surveillance program in Japan is necessary to standardize the strategy for the post-polypectomy surveillance of the colon.",

        "abstract": "Patients using low-dose aspirin (LDA) have an increased risk of gastroduodenal mucosal lesions and upper gastrointestinal symptoms. We aimed to clarify the efficacy of rabeprazole for preventing peptic ulcer, esophagitis, and gastrointestinal symptoms associated with LDA.Patients with a history of peptic ulcers who were receiving LDA for cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease were randomly assigned to receive rabeprazole at 10 mg daily, rabeprazole at 20 mg daily, or gefarnate (a cytoprotective anti-ulcer agent) at 50 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was the development of gastric and/or duodenal ulcer at 12 weeks. The modified Lanza score (MLS) and gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated at baseline and at 12 weeks.The full analysis set comprised 261 patients (rabeprazole 10 mg: n = 87, rabeprazole 20 mg: n = 89, gefarnate 100 mg: n = 85). The cumulative incidences of gastroduodenal ulcers at 12 weeks in the 10 mg rabeprazole group, 20 mg rabeprazole group, and gefarnate group were 7.4, 3.7, and 26.7 %, respectively (rabeprazole group 5.5 % vs. gefarnate group 26.7 %, hazard ratio [HR] 0.179; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.082-0.394; p < 0.0001). The proportions of patients with an MLS of \u22651 and erosive esophagitis were significantly lower in the rabeprazole group than in the gefarnate group at 12 weeks (gastric lesions 33.5 vs. 62.4 %, p < 0.0001; duodenal lesions 5.7 vs. 24.7 %, p < 0.0001; erosive esophagitis 5.8 vs. 19.4 %, p < 0.0001). Rabeprazole was significantly more effective than gefarnate for the resolution and prevention of gastrointestinal symptoms (resolution 53.6 vs. 25.0 %, p = 0.017; occurrence 9.2 vs. 28.3 %, p = 0.0026).Rabeprazole is more effective than gefarnate for reducing the risk of recurrence of peptic ulcer, esophagitis, and gastrointestinal symptoms in LDA users.",

This study aims to examine the influence of brittle behavior of work materials on machinability (including tool wear); therefore, we conduct dynamic ultramicro hardness measurements and microgrooving experiments for three types of ceramics. The results indicate that the groove depth of a work material tends to increase with the processing time. Moreover, material properties of a work material, such as hardness and toughness, have a significant impact on the fluctuations in its groove depth. However, kerf width of a work material does not depend on the processing conditions and material properties. In addition, a faster relative velocity improves processing efficiency but also increases tool wear.",

        "abstract": "The essential features and scale of sensor data was discussed to monitor the tool anomaly in the machining process from the pattern variation of large scale sensor data such as vibration and effective power. The cycle data, the time series sensor data collected with an acceleration or power sensor in one periodical machining of the given groove shape, had been measured periodically. In this study, the graphic pattern formed by overwriting the time series cycle data on a specific coordinate system was treated as the \u201cbig sensor data\u201d. The big data from the effective power sensor can stably respond to the cutting power changes and showed a strong possibility as a detecting device for tool anomaly such as abrasive wear and chipping. While the big data from the acceleration sensor only responded to a big event like the chattering vibration. The number of cycle data needed to generate the big sensor data also affected on the detection sensitivity for tool anomaly. It had been required a family of time series sensor data enough to represent the cutting power change as a visual graphic pattern.",

        "abstract": "A wire tool having electrodeposited diamond grains is frequently used for machining hard and brittle materials such as silicon ingots, magnetic materials, ceramics, and sapphires. This study aims to examine the wear characteristics of the tool during the microgrooving of ceramics. We conducted microgrooving experiments for alumina ceramics. The results indicate that the grooving time and the machining distance influence the groove depth. However, as the damage in a wire tool progresses, the groove depth does not depend on the machining distance. A fast relative velocity leads to serious damage in the wire tool even when the machining time is short. In the case of wet grooving, the damage to the wire tool was smaller than that in the case of dry grooving.",

        "abstract": "It is well-known that a series of cracks sometimes gets initiated perpendicular to the cutting edges on the rake faces of brittle cutting tools made of materials such as cemented carbide, ceramics, and cermet under high-speed intermittent cutting. The tools used in intermittent cutting processes are exposed to elevated temperatures during cutting and then cool quickly during the noncutting time. Previous studies have suggested that such repeated thermal shocks generate thermal stress in the tool and that the thermal cracks are then propagated by thermal fatigue. Recently, high-speed machining techniques have attracted the attention of researchers. To apply new cutting tool materials to this machining process, it is important to evaluate their thermal shock fatigue resistances. During high-speed intermittent cutting, the frequency of thermal shocks becomes high and the action area of the thermal shocks is limited to the rake face of the tool. Therefore, conventional thermal shock resistance evaluation methods are unsuitable for this case. Consequently, the authors have developed a new experimental evaluation method using a CO2 laser beam. In this study, we irradiated cemented carbide and TiN cermet cutting tools with the CO2 pulse laser beam and gauged the effectiveness of the proposed thermal shock fatigue resistance evaluation method. The results show a correlation between the thermal shock due to the CO2 pulse laser beam and those due to the intermittent cutting experiments.",

        "abstract": "We show that expression of the p34cdc2 and cyclin A genes is induced by interleukin-2 in normal human T cells and present evidence to support the idea that these genes are deregulated in leukemic T cells. Our DNA sequencing data indicate that the promoter region of the p34cdc2 gene contains putative E2F-like binding sites which are recognized by Rb and binding sites for c-myb, Sp1, and ATF, and that the promoter region of the cyclin A gene contains binding sites for p53, Sp1, and ATF. In this study we focus on the effect of p53 and Rb on these cell cycle-regulatory genes. Cotransfection of Y79 human retinoblastoma cells with a p34cdc2 promoter-luciferase expression vector and a plasmid expressing the retinoblastoma gene (RB) indicated that RB suppresses p34cdc2 expression. Cotransfection of B104 rat neuroblastoma cells with a cyclin A promoter-luciferase expression vector and a plasmid expressing the normal or mutant p53 indicated that only the normal p53 suppresses cyclin A expression. In normal T cells, PHA stimulation reduces the amount of complexes in the p34cdc2 promoter between the E2F-like binding site and the RB gene product. These complexes were not detected in leukemic T cells. Our data support the idea that tumor suppressors modulate the expression of cell cycle-regulatory genes: RB regulates p34cdc2 expression and p53 regulates cyclin A expression.",

The increase of RB promoter activity was reduced when a point mutation was designed in the ATF site. In a gel shift assay of the ATF site, two specific bands were observed. One of them, with the lower mobility, disappeared during differentiation. This band reacted with an antibody against ATF-1. We cotransfected an RB promoter-luciferase plasmid with the TREB36/ATF-1 plasmid. ATF-l suppressed the activity of the wild-type RB promoter but not of that with a point mutation at the ATF site. These results suggest that the ATF site of the RB promoter is a responsive element during myogenic differentiation of C2 cells. We hypothesize that RB promoter activity is stimulated partially due to the dissociation of ATF-1, which suppresses the promoter activity through the ATF site in C2 myoblasts.",

In B104, a rat neuroblastoma cell line, pRB stimulated luciferase activity about 2-fold from the wild-type promoter, and about 4-fold from a mutant promoter with a mutation in the retinoblastoma binding factor 1 (RBF-1) site. The RB-responsive region was mapped to a novel 44 bp sequence in the 5' untranslated region in both wild-type and mutant promoters. When apparent stimulation of luciferase activity by pRB was observed, the luciferase mRNA level did not increase, suggesting that through this 44 bp region, pRB could post-transcriptionally regulate its own expression.",

        "abstract": "We previously reported 9 unilateral, sporadic retinoblastomas with hypermethylation in the 5' region of the RB gene, and we found that CpG methylation in the RB promoter inhibits the binding of the retinoblastoma binding factor 1 (RBF-1) and the activating transcription factor (ATF)-like factors, thereby resulting in a considerable reduction in RB promoter activity. In this study, we screened for hypermethylation in 121 additional cases of retinoblastoma, and found 5 tumors with hypermethylation, including 4 unilateral, sporadic tumors, and one hereditary tumor. The hereditary tumor had a germline deletion of one allele, and the hypermethylation was an acquired, epigenetic change in the other allele. Another tumor had hypermethylation restricted to approximately 800 base pairs in the RB promoter region including the essential RBF-1 and ATF sites. The frequency of hypermethylation in unilateral, sporadic tumors was 9.3% combining our previous and present examinations (13 among 140), whereas the frequency was 1.0% in bilateral hereditary tumors (one among 101). The statistical analyses using the chi-square test indicated significant correlation between hypermethylation and unilateral, sporadic tumors (p < 0.05). These results suggest that hypermethylation in the RB gene is always an acquired, epigenetic change and causes about 9% of unilateral, sporadic tumors.",

However,Spi proteinwas shownnot to bindto the Spi site; this indicated that the Spi consensus site mutation was blocking the action of an alternative transcription factor, which we called RBF-1 (retinoblastoma binding factor 1). Subsequent purification of RBF-1 revealed it to be hGABPIE4TF1,a transactivatorfrom the adenovirusearly-region4 pro moter. In this study, we directly examined the effects ofhGABP/E4TF1 on transactivation of theRBgenepromoter through the RBF-1 site.As expected, hGABP/E4TF1 enhanced the core RB promoter activity, whereas it did not stimulate a mutant RBF-1 site. We therefore conclude that the most essentialtranscriptionfactor in the humanRB gene is likely",

The thruster was operated with a divergent-type hollow anode. The results showed that some increment in thrust and thrust efficiency was realized by changing the width of hollow anode. With a wider hollow anode the thrust efficiency reached 0.42 with a mass flow rate of 4 mg/s at a discharge voltage of 400 V. This is expected because of more efficient ionization and lower wall losses in a wider anode.",

An observation of the cell surface of mcd4 \u0394 cells and an examination of the effect of contact between mcd4 \u0394 cells and mouse macrophages indicated that macrophages were activated by contact with mcd4 \u0394 cells displaying \u03b2-glucans on the cell surface. We further examined the effect of intraperitoneal ethanol-fixed mcd4 \u0394 cells on the survival period of mice infected with Candida albicans . mcd4 \u0394 cells prolonged the survival period, implying that mcd4 \u0394 cells may enhance the immune function of mice via macrophage activation. Moreover, we examined the structures of \u03b2-glucans ( i.e. , alkali- and acetic acid-insoluble \u03b2-glucans) extracted from mcd4 \u0394 with 13 C-NMR and the effect of extracted \u03b2-glucans on TNF-\u03b1 secretion from macrophages. The structures of the \u03b2-glucans from mcd4 \u0394 differed from those of wild type (WT); however, there was no difference in tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) secretion level between \u03b2-glucans from mcd4 \u0394 and those from WT. The yield of purified \u03b2-glucans obtained from dry cells of mcd4 \u0394 was higher than that obtained from dry cells of WT. mcd4 \u0394 may be a superior strain for the preparation of \u03b2-glucans.",

        "abstract": "The T cell Ig- and mucin domain-containing molecule-3 (Tim-3) negative immune checkpoint receptor demarcates functionally exhausted CD8(+) T cells arising from chronic stimulation in viral infections like HIV. Tim-3 blockade leads to improved antiviral CD8(+) T cell responses in vitro and, therefore, represents a novel intervention strategy to restore T cell function in vivo and protect from disease progression. However, the Tim-3 pathway in the physiologically relevant rhesus macaque SIV model of AIDS remains uncharacterized. We report that Tim-3(+)CD8(+) T cell frequencies are significantly increased in lymph nodes, but not in peripheral blood, in SIV-infected animals. Tim-3(+)PD-1(+)CD8(+) T cells are similarly increased during SIV infection and positively correlate with SIV plasma viremia. Tim-3 expression was found primarily on effector memory CD8(+) T cells in all tissues examined. Tim-3(+)CD8(+) T cells have lower Ki-67 content and minimal cytokine responses to SIV compared with Tim-3(-)CD8(+) T cells. During acute-phase SIV replication, Tim-3 expression peaked on SIV-specific CD8(+) T cells by 2 wk postinfection and then rapidly diminished, irrespective of mutational escape of cognate Ag, suggesting non-TCR-driven mechanisms for Tim-3 expression. Thus, rhesus Tim-3 in SIV infection partially mimics human Tim-3 in HIV infection and may serve as a novel model for targeted studies focused on rejuvenating HIV-specific CD8(+) T cell responses.",

        "abstract": "Homeostatic proliferation of naive T cells in the spleen and cutaneous lymph nodes supplies memory-phenotype T cells. The \"systemic\" proliferative responses divide distinctly into fast or slow cell division rates. The fast proliferation is critical for generation of effector memory T cells. Because effector memory T cells are abundant in the lamina propria of the intestinal tissue, \"gut-specific\" homeostatic proliferation of naive T cells may be important for generation of intestinal effector memory T cells. However, such organ-specific homeostatic proliferation of naive T cells has not yet been addressed. In this study, we examined the gut-specific homeostatic proliferation by transferring CFSE-labeled naive CD4(+) T cells into sublethally irradiated mice and separately evaluating donor cell division and differentiation in the intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), and other lymphoid organs. We found that the fast-proliferating cell population in the intestine and MLNs had a gut-tropic \u03b14\u03b27(+) Th17 phenotype and that their production was dependent on the presence of commensal bacteria and OX40 costimulation. Mesenteric lymphadenectomy significantly reduced the Th17 cell population in the host intestine. Furthermore, FTY720 treatment induced the accumulation of \u03b14\u03b27(+)IL-17A(+) fast-dividing cells in MLNs and eliminated donor cells in the intestine, suggesting that MLNs rather than intestinal tissues are essential for generating intestinal Th17 cells. These results reveal that MLNs play a central role in inducing gut-tropic Th17 cells and in maintaining CD4(+) T cell homeostasis in the small intestine.",

        "abstract": "HIV infection induces phenotypic and functional changes to CD8+ T cells defined by the coordinated upregulation of a series of negative checkpoint receptors that eventually result in T cell exhaustion and failure to control viral replication. We report that effector CD8+ T cells during HIV infection in blood and SIV infection in lymphoid tissue exhibit higher levels of the negative checkpoint receptor TIGIT. Increased frequencies of TIGIT+ and TIGIT+ PD-1+ CD8+ T cells correlated with parameters of HIV and SIV disease progression. TIGIT remained elevated despite viral suppression in those with either pharmacological antiretroviral control or immunologically in elite controllers. HIV and SIV-specific CD8+ T cells were dysfunctional and expressed high levels of TIGIT and PD-1. Ex-vivo single or combinational antibody blockade of TIGIT and/or PD-L1 restored viral-specific CD8+ T cell effector responses. The frequency of TIGIT+ CD4+ T cells correlated with the CD4+ T cell total HIV DNA. These findings identify TIGIT as a novel marker of dysfunctional HIV-specific T cells and suggest TIGIT along with other checkpoint receptors may be novel curative HIV targets to reverse T cell exhaustion.",

Survey data collected from 600 households between October and November 2015 was used to test hypotheses on demographic, informational, and participatory determinants of willingness to invest in energy efficient lighting. Results of an ordinal logit regression on 600 respondents in Bogor show willingness to purchase these technologies were positively correlated with information and participation variables. The estimates from these fuller models suggest that information of both relevant policies and training in the workplace were more likely to purchase energy saving lightings relative to those with less information. The national energy efficiency labelling program are shown to have a positive effect on purchasing LED lightings. Moreover, information should be as specific to the local and personal context as possible. A lack of information could to some degree be compensated by engaging in environmentally-related activities\u2014with regular participants more likely to change their willingness to change purchasing behavior than less frequent participants.",

        "title": "Exploring influential factors on transition process of vehicle ownership in developing Asian city, A case study in Bogor city Indonesia.",
        "abstract": "Motorization has increased sharply forced by economic growth couple with poor public transport services especially at urban areas in Asian cities. A transition process to a private vehicle dependent society could be found in many cities because local authority doesnu0027t have appropriate planning to anticipate it while earlier studies also clearly identified that some countries has already finish the transition process from of the vehicle ownership such as Japan and Korea. This paper aims to analyze influential factors on transition phenomena of vehicle ownership by applying ordered logit model which consider socio-economic and geographical aspects. The empirical case study was conducted based on face to face interview survey in 2015 of 600 household in Bogor city Indonesia. The transition process of vehicle ownership could be obtained from aggregate data that show several type of ownership such as non-vehicle owner, single motorcycle, multiple motorcycle and multiple vehicle or combination of private car and motorcycle. The estimation was calculated by econometric software LIMDEP. It shows a robust and reliable estimation result. We found a clear and significant transition process which shown as estimated coefficient for different group of vehicle owner. The ordered logit model also be able to explore influential factors on vehicle ownership. First, household income and home ownership give positive influence on vehicle ownership. In contrast, age; education level; family size and residential location give negative influence on vehicle ownership. Household living in central business area did not indicate an interest in owning a private vehicle. The study also found a rapid growth of household income within last 10 years which may increase vehicle population and change its composition in next near future in Bogor city. Local policy makers should therefore aware on this situation and prepare appropriate action to control vehicle population and its use. The revitalization of central business district and its public transport system could play significant role to control vehicle ownership in Bogor city.",

We produced a recombinant human BPGM (rBPGM) by gene manipulation using E. coli and then obtained the polyclonal antibody by immunizing rabbits with purified rBPGM. The reproducibility of the ELISA was in an acceptable range with a coefficient of variation under 1.5%. The ELISA was reliable in the range of 0.1 to 10 ng/mL. The polyclonal anti-rBPGM antibody did not show any cross-reaction with recombinant human B type phosphoglycerate mutase, which is highly homologous to rBPGM. The ELISA was found to be practical for the determination of BPGM protein content in human erythrocytes. The mean BPGM protein content was 56.3+/-9.7 microg/mL in whole blood (mean+/-SD, n = 50). The ELISA can be used to examine various hematologic disorders with abnormal red cell size and cell counts, and to detect BPGM enzymopathy in human erythrocytes.",
