        "abstract": "The influence of mass fraction of Titanium on the glass forming ability of bulk (Zr0.6Cu0.2Ni0.1 Al0.1)100-xTix(x = 1.5, 3, ⋯, 7.5) metallic glass has been investigated. With the increasing of mass fraction of Ti, the supercooled liquid region ΔTx decreases greatly, but the reduced glass temperature Trg increases gradually. Meanwhile the maximum thickness of wedge-shaped samples of varying mess fraction of Ti increases with the increasing tendency of Trg, which suggests that added Ti can promote the glass forming ability essentially and the alloy with 6% Ti has the best glass forming ability. The above results imply that the alloy with 6%Ti is a good glass former.",

        "abstract": "Xishan Fault group is distributed in the transition zone between the fold-reverse fault system along the front of the north Tianshan Mountains to the west and the thrust tectonics of Bogeda to the east. It is a tectonics that thrusts from the basin in the north to the mountains in the south, consisting of 4 ∼ 5 faults that are more than 10 to about 30km long, showing low angles near surface and converging on the detachment surface at about 11km deep. We discovered that the activity of Xishan Fault group is distinct during late Quaternary by doing field investigation of geology and geomorphology, excavating trenches along faults and analyzing deep structure of the fault group. The faults offset the second and above terraces of Wanjiagou creek and created fault scarps of 0.5 ∼ 5.4m high on the terraces. And traces of paleoearthquakes can be found easily. The younger two events on F1, F2 and F3 are confined in (22.7 ± 5.2)ka and 40ka BP by OSL samples dating, respectively and the traces of the youngest event on F4 and the front fault of Xishan are covered by deposits whose ages of OSL samples are about (31.1 ± 3.2) ka and (37.9 ± 3.8) ka BP, respectively. It means that there was grouped faulting in late Quaternary in the Xishan Fault group. F1, F2 and F3 or F4 and the front fault of Xishan might rupture in a same event on near surface. Event traces on the Xishan Fault group and other reverse faults of low angle show that the deposits along the front of fault scarp, the offset relation between fault and deposit bed, and the abrupt increase and diminution of displacement on difference markers or unconformable surfaces on both sides of fault are important identification marks of paleoearthquakes along surface rupture-type reverse fault. The deposits along the front of fault scarp on reverse faults of low angle are much more different from those on normal fault. For ideal mode, the deposit in front of fault scarp of reverse fault of low angle is characterized with that the original structure of the collapsing thrust sheet front is not broken entirely on the lower part and the sloping deposit on the upper part may exist covering on both sides of the fault. We think that it is very important for reducing uncertainty of paleoearthquake identification to seek for evidences as many as possible and analyze the different influencing factors, such as tectonics, climate, environment and anthropic activities.",

        "abstract": "H2 sensors able to operate at room temperature are very important for safe detection of H2 leakage. We report the large electrical response to H2 of Pt-coated WO3 (Pt-WO 3) nanowire films without the need of using an external heater. More important, hydrogen sensing processes have been investigated under various conditions, including in air, vacuum filled with pure gas, and a mixture of H2 and other gases. This is carried out with both electrical and optical methods. The evidence shows that hydrogen will inject into the nanowire and create oxygen vacancy, in addition to reducing adsorbed oxygen at the surface, as is often recognized. It is experimentally demonstrated that the increase of electrical conductivity resulting from the reaction with hydrogen is hampered by coadsorption of O2, while N2 has no such effect. A model has been developed to combine these new findings to give a clearer understanding of the mechanism responsible for H2 sensing behavior. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",

It is attractive that the distribution of hydrogen atoms in the compounds becomes more uniform with increasing hydrogen pressure and annealing temperature. Homogeneous hydrides of La0.8Ce0.2(Fe 0.985Mn0.015)11.5Si1.5 were obtained by annealing them at the temperature of 773 K and under the hydrogen atmosphere of 0.5 MPa. With changes of Mn content, the Curie temperatures (TC) of the hydrides of La0.8Ce0.2 (Fe1-xMn x)11.5Si1.5 can be adjusted in the room temperature range from 279 to 312 K.

        "abstract": "A simplified simulation approach aiming at reducing computational complexity has been proposed for gated field emitters. In this approach, a thin-film cold cathode consisting of quasi-one-dimensional nanoemitters is modeled as a flat metallic thin-film. The surface of the thin-film is divided into equal-size grids. Fowler-Nordheim parameters fitted with experimental current-voltage data are used to calculate emission current from these individual grids. The statistics of the total emission current and its distribution between the gates and the anode are analyzed by summing the currents from all of the grids. The validity of the proposed approach is evaluated by comparing the simulation results with experimental data from gated carbon nanotube (CNT) thin-film field emitters. CNTs at the edge of the CNT film stand out as superior emitters, and proper consideration of such emitters plays a critical role in determining the validity of the proposed approach. © 2011 American Vacuum Society.",

The coating has a microscopically uniform morphology. As compared to uncoated tips, the electron emission of the coated tip arrays is enhanced, showing an increase in the total current, lower turn-on field and a lower-slope Fowler-Nordheim plot. We propose that field-emitted electrons could tunnel through such a thin coating with few scattering events. It is shown that the low potential barrier at the interface is the major cause of the enhancing effects instead of the negative surface electron affinity of the coating. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this paper, an adiabatic calorimeter has been developed to measure the isochoric specific heat capacity of compressed liquid. A spherical bomb with platinum resistance thermometer inserted was used to hold the measured liquid and two adiabatic shields were arranged to reduce the heat loss of thermal radiation. The isochoric specific heat capacity of liquid propane was measured over temperatures from (236 to 340) K and pressures up to 14 MPa. Satisfactory agreement with published heat capacity data is found and the reliability of the experimental setup is verified. Moreover, the experimental isochoric specific heat capacity data of liquid R1234yf were obtained in the temperatures from (240 to 341) K and pressures up to 13 MPa. The standard uncertainties were estimated to be 10 mK for temperature, 5 kPa for pressure and 1.0% for isochoric specific heat capacity. The data of R1234yf are represented by two Helmholtz equations of state with average absolute relative deviations of 2.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Comparisons are made between the Helmholtz equations of state and the cubic equations of state for the calculation of the specific heat capacity property. The Helmholtz equations of state give a better description than the cubic equations of state, and the Peng–Robinson equation of state performs slightly better than the Patel–Teja and Soave–Redlich–Kwong equations of state.",

        "abstract": "Many scientists have devoted themselves to the study of the interaction between subwavelength structures and electromagnetic waves. These structures are commonly composed of regular arrays of subwavelength protuberances, which can be artificially designed. However, extending from 2D periodic patterns to 3D disordered subwavelength structures has not been studied yet. In this study, we studied the total diffuse reflectivity of carbon aerogels with various 3D networks of randomly oriented particle-like nanostructures by using normally incident visible light (430-675 nm). We observed that the different 3D network nanostructures of carbon aerogels, especially for the structures with the minimum size, reduced the reflectivity effectively. It was found that the key mechanism for the subwavelength-structure-induced ultralow reflectivity property is due to the decrease of the amplitude of electron vibration forced by the electromagnetic wave, which provides a simple method for designing perfect black materials.",

        "abstract": "One of the challenges for the P2P-based service composition process is how to effectively discover and select the most appropriate peers to execute the service applications when considering multiple properties of the requested services. Different ontology-based e-service profiles have been proposed to facilitate handling multiple properties and to enhance the service oriented process in order to achieve the total or partial automation of service discovery, selection and composition. This paper investigates how the ACO (Ant Colony Optimisation) algorithm and the GA (Genetic Algorithm) may facilitate P2P-based (Peer-to-Peer) service selection with multiple service properties. The performance of both algorithms is evaluated and compared statistically using a pooled t-test for 30 randomly generated composition scenarios. Our experimental results show that both algorithms can improve the quality of service composition, while showing that the ACO approach is the more effective.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   As an attractive collector medium for hypervelocity particles, SiO 2  aerogel has been deployed on outer space missions. Aiming at quantifying the complicated relationship between the penetration track and the residual grains, many attempts have been made on hypervelocity experiments and models. However, models were difficult to accord strictly well with experimental data attributed to many uncertainties including thermal effects, aerogel accretions and projectile ablation during the penetration. In this paper, impact experiments were conducted at various density silica aerogels (50∼120 kg·m −3 ) with regular soda-lime glass beads as projectiles. Varying degrees of thermal effects happened around and along track was observed by scanning electron microscopy. That energy distribution in the track released by hypervelocity projectile has a decreasing change. The regular data of the terminal A-β type track (the track with combined features) was found according to A-type tracks classification based on the conditions of  vapor model  (Dominguez, 2009). Just considering for projectile overcoming the crushing strength with uniform deceleration, the simple mechanism was confirmed by the data fitted well with the  snowplow  model (Dominguez et al., 2004). The result after tracks classification is due to the terminal track with few thermal effects and aerogel accretions. In addition, other two types of tracks formation processes were discussed.",

The fracture behavior at high temperatures under tension deformation can be classified as three modes, i.e. brittle fracture, necking fracture and sustainable deformation, which strongly depend on the test temperature and strain rates. Typical vein-like structures are dominant on the brittle fracture surfaces at high temperatures while cleavage veins with round-cores are observed at room temperature. The high-temperature deformation behavior and the underlying controlling mechanisms are discussed in the frame of the ‘free volume’ theory.",

There exists a general correlation between the hardness and wear resistance, i.e., a lower hardness produces a lower wear resistance. Scratch velocity appears to have little effect on the scratch depths of the four alloys studied. However, faster scratch velocity leads to finer shear bands. Compared with ribbon sample with the same chemical composition, Ti-based bulk glassy sample that experienced slower cooling rate during solidification, and thus contained less free volume, exhibits better wear resistance.",

A total of 168 data points was obtained at temperatures from (265.460 to 300.268) K, pressure up to 0.70252 MPa, and mole fractions of HFO1234yf at (0.0906, 0.2546, 0.5830, 0.8116, and 1.0000). For the densimeter, values of the experimental standard uncertainty were less than 5 mK for the temperature, 200 Pa for the pressure, and 0.0003 for the mole fraction. When all the experimental standard uncertainties are considered, the relative uncertainty in density was estimated to be less than 0.13%. The experimental results were correlated using a truncated virial equation of state (EOS) and the Patel-Teja (PT) EOS. The virial model gives the best description of the experimental  pρTx  values with average absolute relative deviations of 0.080% in pressure and 0.085% in density.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Accelerating the separation efficiency of photoexcited electron-hole pairs with the help of highly active co-catalysts has proven to be a promising approach for improving photocatalytic activity. Thus far, the most developed co-catalysts for semiconductor-based photocatalysis are inorganic materials; the employment of a specific organic molecule as a co-catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and pollutant photodegradation is rare and still remains a challenging task. Herein, we report on the use of an organic molecule, oxamide (OA), as a novel co-catalyst to enhance electron-hole separation, photocatalytic H 2  evolution, and dye degradation over TiO 2  nanosheets. OA-modified TiO 2  samples were prepared by a wet chemical route and demonstrated improved light absorption in the visible-light region and more efficient charge transport. The photocatalytic performance of H 2  evolution from water splitting and rhodamine B (RhB) degradation for an optimal OA-modified TiO 2  photocatalyst reached 2.37 mmol g -1  h -1  and 1.43 × 10 −2  min −1 , respectively, which were 2.4 and 3.8 times higher than those of pristine TiO 2 , respectively. A possible mechanism is proposed, in which the specific π-conjugated structure of OA is suggested to play a key role in the enhancement of the charge transfer and catalytic capability of TiO 2 . This work may provide advanced insight into the development of a variety of metal-free organic molecules as functional co-catalysts for improved solar-to-fuel conversion and environmental remediation.",

        "abstract": "Coordinated skills such as speech or dance involve sequences of actions that follow syntactic rules in which transitions between elements depend on past actions. Canary songs are comprised of repeated syllables, called phrases, and the ordering of these phrases follows long-range rules, where the choice of what to sing depends on song structure many seconds prior. The neural substrates that support these long-range correlations are unknown. Using miniature head-mounted microscopes and cell-type-specific genetic tools, we observed neural activity in the premotor nucleus HVC as canaries explore various phrase sequences in their repertoire. We find neurons that encode past transitions, extending over 4 phrases and spanning up to 3 seconds and 40 syllables. These neurons preferentially encode past actions rather than future actions, can reflect more than a single song history, and occur mostly during the rare phrases that involve history-dependent transitions in song. These findings demonstrate that network dynamics in HVC reflect preceding behavior context relevant to flexible transitions.",

The CAs were synthesized by a sol-gel process using an atmospheric drying method. The structure of CAs was characterized by scanning in an electron microscope (SEM) and nitrogen adsorption/desorption techniques. The adsorption system was built using Cu solution as the simulation of heavy metal pollution solution.

        "abstract": "Abstract   A detailed experimental study was carried out to investigate the flow boiling heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics of R600a in a smooth horizontal tube with an inner diameter of 6 mm. The experiments were performed at conditions covering saturation pressures from 0.215 to 0.415 MPa, mass fluxes from 67 to 194 kg m −2  s −1  and heat fluxes from 10.6 to 75.0 kW m −2 . Based on an high speed camera, four main flow regimes can be observed: plug flow, stratified-wavy flow, slug flow and annular flow. Intermittent to annular flow transition was detected and plotted on flow pattern maps. Comparisons with available transition lines in the literature have been made. Furthermore, the influences of saturation pressure, mass flux and heat flux on heat transfer coefficient were analyzed. The experimental data was compared with the calculated data of seven well-known correlations. The results indicated that, the correlation of Liu and Winterton showed the best agreement with a mean absolute relative deviation of 11.5%. For two-phase frictional pressure drop, mass flux had obviously positive effect on frictional pressure drop, while negative effect was found for saturation pressure. Eight correlations were evaluated and the correlation of Muller-Steinhagen and Heck gave the best fit to the experimental data with a mean absolute relative deviation of 32.9%. A new correlation of pressure drop which accounted for the influence of surface tension and gravitational force was developed on the basis of Muller-Steinhagen and Heck correlation and its mean absolute relative deviation was about 16.6% for the experimental data.",

The experimental Results show that V 2O 5 ambient dried aerogels exhibited a fibrous microstructure, surface area was 138.9 m 2/g and average pore diameter was about 15 nm. V 2O 5 aerogels were crystalline when annealed at 300°C. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) with different potentials were studied by fitting EIS date to an equivalent circuit, and then some kinetics parameters were analyzed and discussed. The electrochemical measurements have shown that the specific capacity of V 2O 5 aerogels derived by the ambient pressure dry is 300.45 mAh/g, and it can be used as a good cathode material for Lithium batteries.",

The relationship between penetration depth and velocity is obtained. The empirical equation of penetration depth is established when the bullet speed is lower than the terminal speed; and the equation has a good compatibility with experimental results. The damage types of model experimental targets are analyzed; the results show that various damage types of targets are generated under different projectile velocities for a given bullet and target. The penetration performance, terminal velocity and mass loss of projectile under high impact velocity are investigated; and the elements which affect the terminal velocity and mass loss of projectile are analyzed. It can be used to predict the main parameters such as penetration depth, acceleration, mass loss rate and so on; and it also provides an effective reference to the design of projectile head and protective engineering. The results show that unweathered hard rock can be used as materials in protective engineering after comparing the experiments of concrete plate targets.",

        "abstract": "The tension fracture behavior of Zr41.25T13.75Ni10Cu12.5 Be22.5 bulk metallic glass is associated with the test temperature and strain rate. At room temperature, the brittle fracture is dominated by the shear band's formation and expansion. A large amount of radiating vein-like morphologies and the liquid droplets can be observed on the fracture surface. The calculation found that the adiabatic heating makes the temperature of the fracture surface layer higher than the liquidus temperature. At the glass transition temperature, the fracture mode is still brittle fracture. Dimples, vein-like morphologies and liquid droplets occupy the fracture surface. The adiabatic heating induces the temperature of fracture surface layer to be higher than the liquidus temperature too. With the temperature increasing or the strain rate decreasing, the necking fracture appears. The fracture surface displays the vein-like morphologies without the liquid droplets. The affection of the adiabatic heating is so weak that the temperature of the fracture surface layer can not increase obviously.",

The saturated vapor pressures of the ammonia, n-butane, and 1-butene were measured, and there were quantitative similarities between the experimental data and the data from Refprop 9.1, with differences less than 0.0007 MPa. The reliability of the experimental setup was verified. The experimental data of the (ammonia + n-butane) system and the (ammonia + 1-butene) system were presented. The homogeneous azeotropic behavior was shown at T = (293.150 and 283.150) K and a heterogeneous azeotropic was found at 273.150 K for the (ammonia + 1-butene) system. Besides, a heterogeneous azeotropic was found at T = (273.150 and 263.150) K for the (ammonia + n-butane) system. All the experimental data were correlated with...",

By surveying the deformation micro-topography, excavating two large paleoearthquake trenches, and dating a series of samples of thermoluminescence, the quantity activity characteristics of the Ganhezi fault segment of the Fukang fault belt are revealed. The Ganhezi fault segment is a Holocene active fault, with a total length about 33 km. The fault activity is obvious, generating a series of apparent geomorphic traces on the surface. Since the Late-Quaternary, the average vertical slip rate of fault is about 0.34-0.43 mm/a. Since the Mid-Holocene, there were two paleoearthquake events; the strong earthquake recurrence period of the fualt segment is about 2 100-3 750 a. The vertical surface displacement is about 1.5 m and the elapsed time is 4.11 ka of the latest paleoearthquake, corresponding to the paleoearthquake magnitude of between Ms7.2-7.4. The fault has accumulated a high energy so far.",

After carbonization in nitrogen atmosphere and a magnesiothermic reaction at 700 °C, RF/SiO 2 aerogels were successfully converted to monolithic mesoporous silicon carbide (SiC aerogels). The starting RF/SiO2 aerogels had an interpenetrating organic/inorganic network and the resulting SiC products preserved monolithic mesoporous morphology similar to the original templates. The as-synthesized SiC aerogels consisted of nanocrystalline β-SiC, possessed a BET surface area of 232 m2/g and showed sufficient mesoporosity. They had a direct band gap of about 3.2 eV (less than that of bulk β-SiC) and showed photoluminescence at room temperature. The mechanisms about the formation of RF/SiO2 gels and the conversion to SiC aerogels were discussed. Potentially, the reported method can be used to convert many metal or semimetal oxide/carbon composite aerogels to carbide aerogels at relatively low temperature for many catalytic, electronic, photonic and thermal applications. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The tumor location, morphological features, signal intensity, calcification, contrast enhancement characteristics, involvement of paraspinal soft tissues and adjacent bony structures were assessed.Of six patients, four had extradural lesions and two had intradural, extramedullary lesions. Most lesions were well defined and manifested heterogeneous iso- or hypo-intense signal on T1-weighted imaging and hyper-intense signal on T2-weighted imaging and moderate attenuation on CT, and were heterogeneously enhanced after contrast enhancement. The lesion extending through the intervertebral foramen with a large paraspinal soft tissue mass formed was found in four patients and vertebral bone involvement was seen in four patients.Although imaging findings are not specific of intraspinal primitive neuroectoderal tumor, this diagnosis could be suggested when MR imaging depicts an intradural, extramedullary or extradural large well-circumscribed mass which extends out from intervertebral foramen and invades paraspinal soft tissues or vertebral bones in a young patient.",

Although numerous databases have been designed by collecting data either only from literature manually or together with prediction outcomes from computational models, there is currently not a comprehensive data service framework delivering better insights for these results. In this paper, we introduce a biological sequence data service towards delivering deeper insights and helping better biological experiments design. The service includes following major components: a comprehensive database for storing biological data, data analytics tools for analysing biological data, and computational models for delivering testable prediction outcomes. Specifically, we present this service in a framework for studies on host-pathogen interactions. The design of this framework aims to improve the understanding of host-pathogen interactions. The relationships of hierarchical databases and their working mechanism, specifically between PPIs and DDIs, are also presented in this framework. Finally, the preliminary and practical experiences of building computational model for prediction is discussed.",

        "abstract": "Silica-titania composite aerogels were synthesized by chemical liquid deposition of titania onto nanoporous silica scaffolds. This novel deposition process was based on chemisorption of partially hydrolyzed titanium alkoxides from solution onto silica nanoparticle surfaces and subsequent hydrolysis and condensation to afford titania nanoparticles on the silica surface. The titania is homogeneously distributed in the silica-titania composite aerogels, and the titania content can be effectively controlled by regulating the deposition cycles. The resultant composite aerogel with 15 deposition cycles possessed a high specific surface area (SSA) of 425 m(2)/g, a small particle size of 5-14 nm, and a large pore volume and pore size of 2.41 cm(3)/g and 18.1 nm, respectively, after heat treatment at 600 °C and showed high photocatalytic activity in the photodegradation of methylene blue under UV-light irradiation. Its photocatalytic activity highly depends on the deposition cycles and heat treatment. The combination of small particle size, high SSA, and enhanced crystallinity after heat treatment at 600 °C contributes to the excellent photocatalytic property of the silica-titania composite aerogel. The higher SSAs compared to those of the reported titania aerogels (<200 m(2)/g at 600 °C) at high temperatures combined with the simple method makes the silica-titania aerogels promising candidates as photocatalysts.",

The objective of the research was to synthesize carbon aerogel films at ambient conditions. Resorcinol formaldehyde (RF) and carbon aerogel films have been produced with extremely high RC ratio (molar ratio of resorcinol to catalyst) followed by subcritical drying. The structure of the porous films was investigated using electron scanning microscope. The specific surface area was measured by using nitrogen adsorption (BET) and electrical conductivity was measured with four-probe method. It was found that with extremely high RC ratio, the porous structure of RF and carbon aerogel films can be controlled from micro to macro porous at ambient conditions. With respect to the application as electrodes for fuel cells, carbon aerogel films with different porous structures on the two surfaces have been also obtained through optimizing the sol-gel process.",

To produce graphene aerogels with low density, while maintaining high electrical conductivity and strong mechanic performance, we synthesized graphene aerogels by the magnesiothermic reduction of a freeze-dried graphene oxide (GO) self-assembly and subsequent etching of the formed MgO in acid solution. The reduced graphene oxide (rGO) aerogel samples exhibited densities as low as 1.1 mg·cm−3. The rGO aerogel was very resilient, exhibiting full recoveryeven after being compressed by strains of up to 80%; its elastic modulus (E) scaled with density (ρ) as E∼ρ2. The rGO aerogels also exhibited high conductivities (e.g., 27.7 S·m−1 at 3.6 mg·cm−3) and outperformed many rGO aerogels fabricated by other reduction processes. Such outstanding properties were ascribed to the microstructures inherited from the freeze-dried GO self-assembly and the magnesiothermic reduction process.",

A side view scanning electron micrograph of a typical W18O49 pencil-like nanostructure arrays (a) and the enlarged SEM image (b) of a nanotip, as well as their typical SAEDS spectrum (c) and typical XRD spectrum (d) is shown. The samples of W18O49 pencil-like nanostructure arrays exhibit very good field emission characteristics. The array of low density has a better field emission characteristic and this indicates that lowering the density may decrease the field screening effect.",

In order to optimize its interface character, sol-co-gelation technique was created to improve the interdiffusion and smooth out the density mutation via a self-built device. Finally, on the base of the device and sol-co-gelation technics, a continuous formation process was developed to fabricate the completely gradient density silica aerogel. Optical microscope and X-ray phase contrast method were used to characterize the samples prepared by three different technics and comparatively research their interface feature.",

Individual ultra-long AlN nanowire (UAN) exhibits a clear photoconductive effect under different excited lights. We attribute the positive photocurrent response of individual UAN to the dominant molecular sensitization effect. It is found that they have a much faster response speed (a rise and decay time of about 1 ms), higher photocurrent response (2.7×106), and more reproductive working performance (the photocurrent fluctuation is lower than 2%) in the air environment. Their better photoconductive performances are comparable to many nanostructures, which are suggested to be a candidate for building promising photosensitive nanodevices in the future.",

Firstly, a distributed state observer is introduced to estimate the state of each agent by using the relative output information between neighbors. Secondly, based on the truncated prediction approach, the consensus algorithm is proposed by utilizing the estimated state information. The sufficient conditions are constructed by Lyapunov stability theory and then solved by a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) with iterative parameters. Finally, a simulation example is given to verity the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

The displacement of the probe beam centroid is found to be a rigorous measurement of PD effect, which leads to a set of analytical solutions to the fundamental and the second-order harmonics. Harmonics are caused by the diffraction of the probe beam in the mirage region, which could not be handled by geometric-optics theory. This theory can be used to study bulk materials, thin films, and layered-structure samples. Experimental results are in good agreement with the theory.",

The morphology and microstructure of the ZTO nanodendrite have been investigated by means of field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). SEM observation revealed the formation of branched nanostructures and showed that each branch exhibited a unique periodic structure formed by a row of overlaid rhombohedra of ZTO nanocrystals along the axis of the nanobranch. HRTEM studies displayed that the branches grew homoepitaxially as single-crystalline nanowires from the ZTO nanowire backbone. A possible growth model of the branched ZTO nanowires is discussed. To successfully prepare branched structures would provide an opportunity for both fundamental research and practical applications, such as three-dimensional nanoelectronics, and opto-electronic nanodevices. © 2008 Chin.

        "abstract": "The Baiyun Sag, located in the deep-water continental slope region and on the down dip side of the paleo-Pearl River and the large sand-rich Pearl River delta in shallow continental shelf, is a favorable area for developing large-scale deep-water fan system. The study of sequence stratigraphy of the deep-water slope area aided by regional geological research led to the discovery of the Pearl River Deep-water Fan System with its overlapping multi-sequences, which makes the Baiyun Sag a new prospective area for petroleum exploration. Apart from the resolution of different data, multiple solutions and limitations in the interpretation of sequence stratigraphy, the study of the Pearl River Deep-water Fan System emphasizes the following research aspects: (1) the comprehensive application and mutual authentication of data from different disciplines; (2) the control of periodic sea-level change on the depositional systems; (3) validity of the identification of the isochronic horizons from seismic reflection and the identification of sequence boundary; (4) the response of the sequence boundary to biostratigraphy, relative sea-level change and global eustacy; and the response correlation between different sedimentary bodies in a sequence-stratigraphic framework.The buildup of the sequence-stratigraphic framework leads to the discovery of the Pearl River Deep-water Fan System. It reveals the coupling relationship among the Pearl River drainage area, the large-scale Pearl River delta on the continental shelf and the Pearl River Deep-water Fan System on the continental slope;as well as the response relationship between the Pearl River Deep-water Fan System and the sea-level changes; and the correlation between deep-water fans and paleogeography. The discovery of the Pearl River Deep-water Fan System greatly promotes petroleum exploration in the deep-water slope area of the South China Sea.",

        "abstract": "Low capacitance and sluggish kinetics of positive and negative electrode materials are two main obstacles that restrict the electrochemical performance of flexible asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). In this work, an effective metal–organic framework (MOF)-derived approach is proposed to construct high-performance positive and negative electrode materials with a core–shell heterostructure. The binary MOF arrays are converted to zinc–cobalt sulfide nanosheet scaffolds with excellent conductivity and a ductile structure, which can offer an electrically and ionically conductive 3D continuous network for the growth of active materials. Based on this platform, the originally built Ni(OH)2@ZnCoS-NSs are validated to be a highly capacitive positive electrode (8.1 F cm−2 at 3 mA cm−2, i.e., 2730 F g−1), matching well with the similarly constructed VN@ZnCoS-NS negative electrode (1.35 F cm−2 at 3 mA cm−2). Benefiting from the rationally engineered electrodes, the assembled ASC device can exhibit ultrahigh energy density (75 W h kg−1 at a power density of 0.4 kW kg−1), stable electrochemical stability (82% capacitance retention even after 10 000 cycles), and excellent flexibility (92% capacitance retention after bending 4000 times). This study demonstrates an attractive strategy for the rational design of high-performance heterostructure electrodes by exploiting the compositional and structural versatility of 2D MOF arrays.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This study aimed to investigate the electrochemical behavior and passive film properties of Fe-based bulk metallic glass (BMG) formed in Cl − -containing acetic acid solutions under high temperature. Electrochemical tests showed that Fe-based BMG exhibited excellent pitting resistance and stable passivation characteristics. However, the uniform corrosion resistance of Fe-based BMG is deteriorated in the presence of Cl −  anions. Mott-Schottky, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profiling, and ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy analyses revealed that the passive films possess a duplex membrane structure. High-valence cations and Cl −  anions relatively localized in the external layer, whereas low-valence cations relatively localized in the internal layer. Moreover, Cl −  exposure increases the porosity and decreases the compactness of the passive film by modifying stoichiometry, improving acceptor density, reducing work function, and enhancing the state density of valence electrons around the Fermi level. Results implied that Fe-based BMGs are potential substitutes for conventional stainless steel components that are exposed to organic manufacturing environments.",

The Curie temperature TC increases linearly with the increase of silicon concentration. Although the maximum value of ΔSm under a field change of 0-5 T decreases from 30.5 to 11.4 J/kg K as x increases from 1.5 to 2.0, the hysteresis loss at TC reduces remarkably from 89.2 J/kg for x=1.5 to zero for x=2.0 because the increase of Si content can weaken the itinerant electron metamagnetic transition. The effective refrigerant capacity RCeff is maintained at high values of 362-439 J/kg for a field change of 0-5 T. This implies that a large ΔSm and a high RCeff can be achieved simultaneously in the La0.7Pr0.3Fe13-xSix compounds. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

With d varying in the range of 0.4-2 mm, the emission current-gap voltage characteristics and the corresponding Fowler-Nordheim (FN) plots show distinct nonlinearity and regular changes with electrode separation. Three field enhancement factors may be derived from the three linear sections of a FN plot. Their variation with gap d results in different behaviours; significantly a drop of five times in the field enhancement factor is observed. The physical process responsible for our findings is suggested to be the space charge effect and both theoretical and experimental evidence is provided to support our arguments. The implication of our findings in technical applications is also discussed.",

In this paper, we study the mechanism of annealing treatment effect on the gasochromic properties both of the WO3 bulks and WO3 films. WO3 bulks were prepared from WO3 sol and dried under ambient pressure, which was previously synthesized via sol-gel method. The WO3 films were prepared using dip-coating method. UV-visible spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction spectra (XRD) were utilized to investigate components, structures and gasochromic properties. And we find that the mechanism of the thermal treatment on the gasochromic performance depends on H+ diffusion velocity which largely relies on the structural water content. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the changes of plasma pro-opiomelanocortion neuropeptides and regulatory factor levels before and after different periods of voyage in carrier-based helicopter pilots,so as to provide reference for related aeromedical support.Methods Twenty-three healthy helicopter pilots served as subjects,in whom 6 pilots experienced 7 days voyage,11 pilots experienced 21 days voyage and 6 pilots experienced 132 days voyage.Levels of β-endorphin(β-EP), adrenocorticotropic hormone(ACTH)and corticotropin releasing hormone(CRH)in plasma were measured by radioimmunoassay before and after voyage.Results After 7 days voyage,the levels of β-EP and ACTH increased significantly(t=2.839,3.104,P<0.05),while the level of CRH did not change significantly(t=0.612,P<0.05).After 21 days voyage,the levels of β-EP,ACTH and CRH increased significantly(t=3.416,2.496,1.951,P<0.01 or 0.05).After 132 days voyage, the levels of β-EP,ACTH and CRH decreased significantly(t=2.988,2.427,2.129,P<0.05). Conclusion Long voyage could influence plasma neuropeptides(β-EP,ACTH)and regulatory factor (CRH)levels of helicopter pilots,and the different changes were correlative to the length of voyage period.",

These samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy (RS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The magnetic properties of the samples were also studied. By increasing the concentration of Tb(NO3)3 or current density, the CeO2-Tb2O3 films with nanobelt structure changed into a blossom-shaped structure with lots of wrinkles and large surface area. XRD and Raman spectroscopy showed the crystal sizes of the samples to be 4-7 nm. XPS analysis indicated that higher current density was favorable to the deposition of CeO2 and inhibited the formation of Tb2O3. The morphology and magnetic property of the samples were determined by the composition. Only the sample mainly composed of Tb 2O3 showed ferromagnetism. Copyright © 2010 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "A rapid and facile synthesis of resorcinol/ formaldehyde cross-linked silica (RF/SiO 2) aerogels was carried out in one pot based on an acid-catalyzed route, instead of the previously reported base-catalyzed ones. The gelation time was reduced to several hours at room temperature while it took several days even under heating conditions in the base-catalyzed ones. The interpenetrating network of RF/SiO 2 aerogels showed similar porous structures with those of silica aerogels or RF aerogels. Their thermal conductivity was as low as that of the typical glass wool materials. The mechanical properties are characterized by dynamic mechanical analysis and compression testing. At room temperature, the results of compression testing show that the compressive Young's modulus or ultimate failure strength of RF/SiO 2 aerogel specimen is higher than that of native SiO 2 aerogels with a similar density. The one-pot method improves the efficiency and reduces the cost of RF/SiO 2 aerogels. The hierarchical porous carbon monoliths are also converted from carbonized RF/SiO 2 aerogels by an additional HF treatment. Hence, they could be further explored as multifunctional candidate materials for thermal, mechanical, and electrochemical applications. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.",

Perfectly aligned fibrous microstructures were fabricated for all four alloys. Tensile properties at elevated temperature were performed. Damage evolution and fracture characteristics at elevated temperature were also investigated. The fracture behavior of the composites in all tensile tests exhibited a ductile behavior at 1000 °C. The high temperature tensile strength was found to increase with the volume fraction of Mo rods. The fibers are expected to bear the greater part of the imposed load due to the strong interface of the constituent phases. The Mo fibers' solid solution strengthened by both Ni and Al also contributes to the strength of composite.",

We present a cloud-based virtual learning environment (VLE) which can organize learners into a better teamwork context and customize micro learning resources in order to meet personal demands in real time. Particularly, a smart micro learning environment was built by a newly designed Software as a Service (SaaS), namely Micro Learning as a Service (MLaaS). It aims to provide adaptive micro learning contents as well as learning path identifications customized for each individual learner. To personalize the micro learning, a dynamic learner model is constructed with regards to the internal and external factors that can affect learning experience and outcomes. Educational data mining (EDM) techniques are employed as the main method to understand learners’ behaviors and recognize learning resource features. A solution of learning path optimization is also proposed towards assembling a complete MOOC learning experience.",

Under a magnetic field change of 5 T, the maximum value of magnetic entropy change -ΔSM is 19.9 J/kg K at 7.5 K and the refrigerant capacity power (RCP) is 300 J/kg with no hysteresis loss. In particular, the large reversible -ΔSM (11.6 J/kg K) is achieved for a low magnetic field change of 2 T.

The experimental and simulation results were coupled to evaluate this method in terms of freckling number, primary dendrite arm spacing (PDAS), dendrite morphology, and solidification interface shape. The results show that, with the application of local cooling method, freckles appearing in the specimens were absolutely removed. Dendrite microstructure was refined with reduced PDAS, and a dendritic to cellular transition was promoted. In addition, the concave solidification interface was flattened. Therefore, the local cooling method with the application of graphite block can be employed to reduce the freckling tendency in directionally solidified CMSX-4 superalloy specimens with abruptly varying cross-sections.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A sphere-packed regenerator is often used in the active magnetic regenerator (AMR) of a magnetic refrigerator. When simulating such a regenerator, porous media instead of the practical sphere geometry is assumed and the solid refrigerants are assumed to be homogeneous in temperature. In fact, the temperature is inhomogeneous and determined by the ratio between sphere radius and thermal penetration depth. A method was used here that evaluates the influence of inhomogeneous temperature distribution inside the spheres on the cooling capacityand a correction factor was proposed to modify the porous media model under different particle diameters, frequencies and mass flow rates. Simulation results showed that the relative deviation of cooling capacity increased in the porous media AMR model with the increase of the ratio between sphere radius and thermal penetration depth. With a frequency below 3 Hz, when the particle radius was approximately 0.8 times the thermal penetration depth, the relative deviation of cooling capacity can be controlled within 5%. Comprehensively considering the pumping work and the heat transfer, a smaller diameter was selected to obtain the maximum COP value, at which the influence of thermal penetration depth can be ignored.",

        "abstract": "PbTiO 3 nanotube arrays have been synthesized via sol–gel template method, and their morphology and structures have been determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The diameter and length of these nanotubes are about 300 nm and 50 μm, respectively, and their wall thickness is typically several tens of nanometers. XRD data shows that as-prepared PTO nanotubes possess perovskite structure, and electron diffraction demonstrates that they are polycrystalline. Photoluminescence spectrum of PTO nanotubes reveals an intense and wide emission band centered at 505 nm. Polarization–electric field ( P – E ) response curves of PTO nanotube array were measured, and the hysteresis loops illustrate a room temperature ferroelectric characteristic of as-prepared PTO nanotubes. Keywords PbTiO 3 Nanotubes Photoluminescence Ferroelectricity 1 Introduction Quasi one-dimensional (Q1D) oxide nanostructures, such as nanowires, nanotubes and nanobelts, are attracting more and more attention because of their novel properties compared to their bulk counterparts and potential applications in nanoelectronics, nano-optics and nanodevices [1–4] . To date, most Q1D simple oxides, for example, ZnO, SiO 2 , In 2 O 3 , TiO 2 , SnO 2 , MgO, etc., have been extensively studied [5–16] . Currently, it has an increasing research interest in Q1D multicomponent complex oxides [4,17–25] . In general, the fabrication of Q1D complex oxide nanostructures is relatively difficult through conventional physical or chemical vapor deposition approaches. Although several examples of solution-based syntheses of perovskite nanowires have been reported recently [18,19,25] , sol–gel template synthesis, in contrast, has been proven to be a simple and low-cost method for fabricating complex oxide nanowires or nanotubes. Anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) is one of the most widely used templates currently because of its highly ordered nanoporous structure, controllable pore size and excellent chemical stability at high temperature. It is expected that most Q1D complex oxide nanowires or nanotubes can be synthesized via sol–gel template method as long as the ingredient and concentration of precursor sol can be properly controlled and the sol can wet out the nanochannel surfaces of AAO template. Lead titanate (PbTiO 3 , PTO) has been widely used in optoelectrics, transducers, sensors and non-volatile memory devices due to its remarkable ferroelectric, pyroelectric and piezoelectric properties [26] . More recently, PTO nanostructures become more and more attractive because they are promising candidates for high-density, non-volatile information storage and scanning probe-based ferroelectric mass storage [27,28] . Several reports have been dedicated to the synthesis and characterization of PTO nanotubes and nanowires [20,29,30] . In the aspects of physical properties, although size-induced ferroelectric phase transitions of PTO nanotubes has been investigated [22] , the photoluminescence (PL) property and polarization–electric field ( P – E ) loops of PTO nanotube arrays are still rarely reported [31] . In this article, we will report the sol–gel template synthesis and structural characterization of PTO nanotubes. Furthermore, photoluminescence and P – E loops of PTO nanotube arrays will also be discussed. 2 Experimental The commercially available AAO membranes (Whatman Anodisc 47, nominal pore diameter 200 nm) were used as templates in our experiments. The precursor sol was prepared as follows: 9.552 g lead acetate (Pb(OAc) 2 , AR) with 5% excess was firstly dissolved in 10 ml glacial acetic acid, and then the solution was refluxed at 60 °C under stirring for 0.5 h. The reason why 5% excess of lead is added in the precursor is to compensate the lead loss during thermal annealing. This has been widely used in the sol–gel synthesis of PTO thin films [22,32,33] . After refluxing, the solution was cooled down to room temperature. A second solution of 7 ml purified Ti(OPr i ) 4 and 10 ml ethanol was added to the lead acetate solution drop by drop. Next, the mixed solution was stirred for several hours to obtain clear sol. Then, the AAO template was immersed into the sol. The immersion time was about 3 h. After that, the AAO template was washed carefully with ethanol for several times to remove the residual sol coated on template surfaces, and dried in air for 0.5 h. The AAO template embedded with PTO gel was calcined in air at a rate of 50 °C/h to 650 °C and was maintained at this temperature for 6 h, then was cooled down to room temperature at a rate of 30 °C/h. The morphology and structure of as-prepared PTO nanotubes were determined by field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-5200), X-ray diffraction (XRD, Riguka) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL 2010). For SEM and TEM observations, the AAO template embedded with PTO nanotubes was soaked in 4 M NaOH solution for 6 h to remove alumina completely, then the resulting product was washed with distilled water for several times. It was found that the released PTO nanotubes could still keep the closely packed film-like morphology even after removal of the template. Some PTO nanotube films were placed on SEM sample holder to perform morphology observation. For TEM investigation, the film was put in deionized water and subjected to ultrasonic treatment for several minutes, then a drop of suspension was placed on carbon-coated copper grid to carry out TEM studies. The PL spectrum was collected by a fluorescence spectrometer (PTI-C-700) equipped with He–Cd laser ( λ = 325 nm, 50 mW). To measure P – E hysteresis loops of PTO nanotube array, both surfaces of the array were firstly polished carefully with sand paper until PTO nanotubes were emerged, and then a layer of Au with a thickness of 100 nm was sputtered on both sides of the template as conductive contacts. The measurement was performed at a nonlinear ferroelectric thin film testing system (Technologies, RT6000S). 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows typical SEM images of as-prepared PTO nanotube array after removal of AAO template. Fig. 1 (a) is an overview image of the array. It can be seen that PTO nanotubes still keep aligned morphology even in the absence of the support from AAO template. The length of nanotubes is about 50 μm, consistent with the thickness of template. A close top view SEM image of PTO nanotube array is given in Fig. 1 (b). From this picture, the open-ended tubular structure can be clearly seen. The magnified top view image is shown in the inset of Fig. 1 (b), illustrating that the average outer diameter and wall thickness of as-prepared nanotubes are about 300 nm and 40 nm, respectively. The particles at the tube mouths are a result of incomplete removal of PTO sol from template surface. Fig. 1 (c) displays a side view image of PTO nanotube array. It is evident that the nanotubes are highly parallel to each other and have a closely packed morphology. Fig. 1 (d) represents a SEM image taken from the middle part of the nanotube array. The fractures resulted from sample preparation process clearly demonstrate that the nanotubes are hollow through the whole length, instead of just at the ends. Fig. 1 (e) shows a representative energy-disperse X-ray (EDX) spectrum of as-prepared PTO nanotubes. It is clear that the nanotubes consist of Pb, Ti and O. The atomic ratio of these three elements is given in the inset of Fig. 1 (e), showing that Pb:Ti:O is approximate to 1:1:3. This demonstrates that the as-prepared PTO nanotubes have an ideal stoichiometric ratio. It is believed that AAO templates we used here played an important role on the formation of nanotubes. As is known, AAO templates have hydrophilic inner surfaces, so the sol entered the nanochannels through capillary action can be easily adsorbed on the channel surfaces, facilitating the tube formation. On the other hand, the 50 μm channel length is too long to allow for more sol solution to enter. Thus, the sol can only fill the nanochannels incompletely, so that solid fibers are difficult to be obtained. In fact, Hernandez et al. have also demonstrated previously that shorter channel length is more conducive to the formation of solid fibers, while using 50-μm thick AAO template yields only nanotubes [22] . The XRD patterns of as-prepared PTO nanotube array embedded in AAO template and PTO gel powders calcined at the same condition are presented in Fig. 2 . Since alumina template begins to be crystallized only when it is annealed above 800 °C [34,35] , it does not contribute any diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern in present case. From Fig. 2 , it is found that all diffraction peaks of PTO gel powders are well consistent with standard powder XRD pattern of tetragonal perovskite PTO (JCPDS 78-0299), and no other impurity phases were detected, which demonstrates the formation of pure tetragonal ferroelectric phase. In contrast, PTO nanotube sample exhibits a similar XRD pattern, but the diffraction peaks of nanotubes are obviously broader. The average crystallite sizes of PTO gel powders and PTO nanotubes are estimated by Scherrer formula after performing proper instrumental broadening correction with LaB 6 standard sample. Scherrer formula can be written as (1) D = K λ β   cos   θ where D stands for crystallite size, K ≈ 0.89 is Scherrer constant, and λ and β represent the wavelength of X-ray and full width at half maximum of the corresponding diffraction peaks, respectively. Since the shape of PTO nano-crystallites may not be spherical, the crystallite sizes of top three strong diffractions (that is, (1 0 0), (1 1 0) and (1 1 1) diffractions) are calculated and their average value is given. As-calculated average crystallite sizes for PTO gel powders and PTO nanotubes are 69.4 nm and 24.3 nm, respectively. It is evident that the average crystallite size of PTO gel powders is nearly three times larger than that of PTO nanotubes, although they were prepared in the same condition. This implies that AAO template may have a confinement effect on the coalescence of PTO nano-crystallites, as suggested by Hernandez et al. [22] . In addition to small crystallite size, another reason responsible for the XRD peak broadening of PTO nanotubes is their poor crystallinity. This will be demonstrated by the HRTEM image shown in Fig. 3 (b), which displays the presence of amorphous PTO besides PTO nano-crystallites. According to Fig. 2 , it is also noted that the proximate double-peak diffractions in nanotube sample is disappeared. This seems to imply the formation of cubic paraelectric phase (JCPDS 70-0747) in as-prepared PTO nanotubes. However, it is known that when evaluating nanomaterials via powder XRD method, the effect of line broadening will sometimes cause a pseudocubic structure to be observed [22,36] . Therefore, it could not be concluded readily now that the PTO nanotubes are paraelectric although they reveal a cubic structure. In fact, we noted that similar result was also reported by Hernandez et al. [22] . They clarified that the cubic paraelectric structure of PTO nanotubes determined by XRD was actually a pseudocubic phase caused by line broadening, and they further confirmed the ferroelectric feature of PTO nanotubes by Raman scattering. In our case, we will also demonstrate below that PTO nanotubes we prepared are ferroelectric at room temperature through P – E loop measurements. Fig. 3 (a) displays a typical TEM image of as-prepared PTO nanotube. From this picture, it can be seen that the outer diameter of PTO nanotube is uniform along the axial direction, but the wall thickness is inhomogeneous, probably due to the inhomogeneous covering of precursor sol on the channel surfaces. The electron diffraction pattern is given in the inset of Fig. 3 (a). The ring-like diffractions clearly demonstrate the polycrystalline character of as-prepared nanotubes, which is in agreement with XRD data. For obtaining further insight about the microstructures of the nanotubes, HRTEM was performed. It is found that the nanotubes actually consist of many PTO nano-crystallites dispersed in amorphous PTO matrix. One of representative HRTEM images of the crystallites is shown in Fig. 3 (b). The interplanar distance of the crystallite is about 0.39 nm, corresponding to that of PTO (1 0 0) crystal planes. The average size of the crystallites is approximate to 20 nm, slightly smaller than that calculated by Scherrer formula (24.3 nm). Although perovskite-type titanates have been extensively studied for many years, their PL properties were neglected. Until recently, the discovery of room temperature PL emission in amorphous ABO 3 perovskites stimulates considerable research interests in room temperature PL of this class of materials [37–43] . Here, room temperature PL behavior of as-prepared PTO nanotubes embedded in AAO template is investigated. For reference, the PL spectra of empty AAO template as well as PTO gel powders are also given. Fig. 4 (a) and (b) shows the PL spectra of AAO template and PTO nanotubes embedded in template, respectively. As is depicted in Fig. 4 (a), two broad emission bands centered at 408 nm and 455 nm were detected. In contrast, the PL spectrum of PTO nanotubes embedded in template can be fitted with three bands centered at 407 nm, 455 nm and 505 nm, respectively, just like the dash curves shown in Fig. 4 (b). Compared with Fig. 4 (a), it is evident that the first two PL bands are originated from the emission of AAO template, while the last band centered at 505 nm is the emission of PTO nanotubes themselves. Fig. 4 (c) displays the PL spectrum of well-crystallized PTO gel powders (as shown in Fig. 2 ). No PL peaks can be detected except the background of excited light source. This agrees well with previous reports [37–43] , which have demonstrated that room temperature PL cannot be observed in well-crystallized ABO 3 materials. Now there is a consensus that room temperature PL emission of amorphous ABO 3 materials is mainly originated from their structural disorder [43] . We consider that this should also be the origin of room temperature PL of PTO nanotubes studied here. As we can see from Fig. 3 (b), the PTO nanotubes consist of small PTO nano-crystallites dispersed in amorphous PTO matrix. Such structural disorder will result in a non-uniform band gap structure [37–40] . On one hand, the presence of amorphous PTO will introduce localized tail states in which electrons or holes may be trapped. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated both experimentally and theoretically that there exist two kinds of Ti coordination in amorphous PTO, fivefold oxygen Ti coordination (TiO 5 square base pyramid) and sixfold oxygen Ti coordination (TiO 6 octahedron) [40,42] . The coexistence of [TiO 5 ] and [TiO 6 ] clusters will yield a charge imbalance that encourages the trapping of holes in previously mentioned localized states. In addition, a large amount of surface defects and oxygen vacancies are usually existed in sol–gel synthesized materials, and consequently yield gap states. Since the PL emission of PTO nanotubes is centered at 505 nm (2.46 eV), It could not result from the direct energy gap transition because the band gaps of PTO ceramic and sol–gel-derived films are around 3.6 eV [44] . Thus, the photoluminescence of PTO nanotubes may be attributed to the radiative recombination between trapped electrons and trapped holes in tail and gap states. This radiative recombination mechanism of PL emission in amorphous PTO nanomaterials has been proven by Leite et al. [39,42,43] . For investigating the ferroelectric feature of as-prepared PTO nanotubes, the P – E loops of nanotube array were measured at room temperature. Fig. 5 (a) is the schematic diagram of P – E curve measurement. The sample stage and two probes are made of stainless steel. One of probes (probe 1) always kept contact with sample stage during the measurement, so that they had equal potential. The PTO nanotube array embedded in AAO template with top and bottom Au electrodes was directly placed on the surface of sample stage, thus, the bottom electrode also got a same potential with sample stage and probe 1. Then another probe (probe 2) was drived to approach the top electrode of PTO nanotube array. A capacitance detector was applied between the two probes to monitor the capacitance between probe 2 and top electrode. When probe 2 did not touch the top electrode, the detector shown the capacitance of the air. But when probe 2 had a good contact with top electrode, the capacitance would have a sharp change. At this point, the measurement could start. P – E loops measured within different voltage ranges are displayed in Fig. 5 (b). Here, the polarization values have been normalized to the area fraction of PTO nanotubes. The hysteresis behavior unambiguously demonstrates the room temperature ferroelectricity of as-prepared PTO nanotubes. It also clarifies that the cubic structure of PTO nanotubes determined by XRD does represent “pseudocubic” phase, and is not a real paraelectric phase. From Fig. 5 (b), it also can be seen that the hysteresis can even occur when the applied voltage changes only within a small range of −1 V to +1 V, indicating that the PTO nanotubes are easily polarized. With the increase of applied voltage range, both remanent polarization and coercive field enlarge gradually. However, leaky behavior is shown when high voltage is applied, as can be seen from the bending corner of P – E loops at extreme applied voltage. We also prepared PTO nanotubes with different diameter and wall thickness successfully. This was achieved by varying pore diameter of template and the immersion time of AAO template in precursor sol. The investigation about the influence of diameter and wall thickness on photoluminescence and ferroelectric properties is in progress. 4 Conclusion In summary, we have successfully prepared PTO nanotube array via sol–gel template approach. The morphology and structures were investigated by SEM, XRD and TEM in detail. Room temperature PL property of as-prepared PTO nanotubes was studied, and a wide PL band centered at 505 nm was detected. It is considered that the luminescence emission is attributed to the polycrystalline microstructures and is originated from the radiative recombination of trapped electrons and holes in tail and gap states. Furthermore, P – E loops of as-prepared PTO nanotube array were measured, and the hysteresis clearly demonstrates the room temperature ferroelectricity of the nanotubes, indicating PTO nanotube array is potential media as ferroelectric information storage.

Here we report the successful synthesis and application of cyclohexanehexone (C6O6), which exhibits an ultrahigh capacity of 902 mA h g-1 with an average voltage of 1.7 V at 20 mA g-1 in LIBs (corresponding to a high energy density of 1533 W h kg-1C6O6). A preliminary cycling test shows that C6O6 displays a capacity retention of 82% after 100 cycles at 50 mA g-1 because of the limited solubility in high-polarity ionic liquid electrolyte. Furthermore, the combination of density functional theory calculations and experimental techniques such as Raman and infrared spectroscopy demonstrates the electrochemical active sites of C=O groups during discharge and charge processes. This work shows favorable prospect to construct next-generation LIBs with ultrahigh-capacity organic electrode materials.",

        "title": "Effect of Pr and Co substitution on magnetic properties and magnetic entropy changes in LaFe13-xSix compounds",
        "abstract": "Effect of Pr and Co substitution on magnetic properties and magnetic entropy changes in the cubic NaZn 13 -type compound LaFe 11.2 Si 1.8 has been experimentally investigated. Replacing 30 at.% La with Pr leads to a decrease of Curie temperature from 216 to 203 K, and drives the magnetic transition from second-order to first-order. As a result, magnetic entropy change, under a field change of 0–5 T, increases from 13.7 to 19.4 J/kg K. Substitution of Co for Fe in La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 11.2 Si 1.8 can adjust T C to around room temperature. A magnetic entropy change of 9.3 J/kg K at T C = 290 K for a field change from 0 to 5 T is obtained in La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 10.4 Co 0.8 Si 1.8 . A reversible variation of magnetization with temperature and magnetic field is observed in the present compound, which is highly desired by the magnetic refrigeration application. Keywords LaFe 13− x Si x compounds Magnetic entropy changes Magnetic properties 1 Introduction La(Fe, Si) 13 compounds with a cubic NaZn 13 -type structure show isotropic Heisenberg ferromagnetic and anomalous critical behavior [1] . Structure and magnetic properties for La(Fe, Si) 13 have been investigated systematically [2] . In recent years, much effort has focused on the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) of La(Fe, Si) 13 because of their potential application in magnetic refrigeration [3] . Previous investigations on LaFe 13− x Si x have confirmed that the compounds with x < 1.7 exhibit a first-order magnetic transition [4] , which leads to a large magnetic entropy change [4–6] due to the itinerant electron metamagnetic (IEM) transition in the paramagnetic state above the Curie temperature T C [7] . However, the Curie temperature is lower than ∼208 K [5] . To meet the requirements of room-temperature magnetic refrigeration, it is necessary to adjust T C to the room-temperature range while retaining the large magnetic entropy. It has been demonstrated that the large magnetic entropy change around room temperature can be gained by introducing Co or interstitial atoms into LaFe 13− x Si x [8–13] . Partially replacing La with Ce, Pr or Nd in La(Fe, Si) 13 was also found to significantly enhance magnetic entropy change [14–16] . In this paper, we report the effect of Pr and Co substitution on magnetic properties and magnetic entropy changes in LaFe 13− x Si x compounds with x = 1.8. A large magnetic entropy change and a reversible variation of the magnetization with temperature and magnetic field around Curie temperature are observed in the present compounds. 2 Experimental Samples of LaFe 11.2 Si 1.8 , La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 11.2 Si 1.8 and La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 10.4 Co 0.8 Si 1.8 were prepared by arc melting appropriate amounts of Pr (99%), La (99.9%), Fe (99.9%) and Co(99.9%), and Si (99.999%) in a high-purity argon atmosphere. The resulting ingots were wrapped by molybdenum foil, sealed in a quartz tube of high vacuum, annealed at 1373 K for 40 days and then quenched to room temperature. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed to check phase purity and structure. The magnetizations were measured as functions of temperature and magnetic field by using a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer. The isothermal magnetic entropy change was calculated from the magnetization data by using the Maxwell relation. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 displays the room-temperature powder XRD patterns of LaFe 11.2 Si 1.8 , La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 11.2 Si 1.8 and La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 10.4 Co 0.8 Si 1.8 . The compounds crystallized in a very clean single phase with a cubic NaZn 13 -type structure. The lattice parameter, obtained from the XRD patterns, is 11.462 Å for LaFe 11.2 Si 1.8 , 11.451 Å for La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 11.2 Si 1.8 and 11.453 Å for La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 10.4 Co 0.8 Si 1.8 . The substitution of Pr leads to a lattice contraction, as previously reported [14] . Fig. 2 shows the temperature dependence of magnetization for La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 11.2 Si 1.8 (a) and La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 10.4 Co 0.8 Si 1.8 (b) compounds measured in the heating and cooling processes under a field of 0.01 T. The temperature step of 1 K with a scanning rate of 1 K/min is chosen in the vicinity of T C and a step of 5 K with a rate of 5 K/min for the regions far away from T C . The thermomagnetic curve exhibits a discontinuous change at T C . For the La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 11.2 Si 1.8 , a small temperature hysteresis of 0.3 K is shown between the transition on heating and cooling, indicating the occurrence of a weakly thermal-induced first-order magnetic transition at T C . It can be seen from Fig. 2 that La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 10.4 Co 0.8 Si 1.8 shows a completely reversible variation of magnetization with temperature. This is a characteristic of second-order transition, as shown in LaFe 11.2 Si 1.8 [17] . The Curie temperature T C is 216, 203 and 290 K for LaFe 11.2 Si 1.8 , La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 11.2 Si 1.8 and La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 10.4 Co 0.8 Si 1.8 , respectively. The substitution of Pr for La leads to a reduction of the T C . A similar case is also observed in the Ce-doped LaFe 13− x Si x compounds [14] , in which the substitution of Ce leads to the T C to decrease. Substitution of smaller Pr atoms for La leads to the lattice contraction, which gives rise to weakening of the Fe–Fe interactions and the decrease of T C . One can find that the substitution of Co for Fe in La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 11.2 Si 1.8 can lift T C to 290 K, near the room temperature. The obvious enhancement of T C may result from the contributions of the strong Fe–Co interactions caused by substitution of Co for Fe. Fig. 3 a shows the magnetization isotherms of La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 11.2 Si 1.8 and La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 10.4 Co 0.8 Si 1.8 measured in a wide temperature range around the Curie temperature and in the field ascending and descending processes, respectively. The temperature step of 2 K is chosen in the vicinity of T C and a step of 5 K for the regions far away from T C . For the samples of LaFe 11.2 Si 1.8 [17] and La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 10.4 Co 0.8 Si 1.8 , no magnetic hysteresis is observed, while the La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 11.2 Si 1.8 compound shows a very small magnetic hysteresis at T C as shown in Fig. 3 b. This implies that the current samples show a nearly perfect magnetic reversibility, which is very favorable to magnetic refrigeration since a completely reversible MCE requires that there is no hysteresis in the magnetization as a function of both the temperature and the magnetic field. Fig. 4 shows the Arrott plots of LaFe 11.2 Si 1.8 , La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 11.2 Si 1.8 and La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 10.4 Co 0.8 Si 1.8 compounds, in which a characteristic of second-order transition is shown for LaFe 11.2 Si 1.8 and La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 10.4 Co 0.8 Si 1.8 compounds. For La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 11.2 Si 1.8 , an obvious inflection point in the Arrott plots at T C is the signature of the IEM transition from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic order above T C , which is expected for large magnetic entropy change. Such a behavior is consistent with that observed in the Ce doped LaFe 13− x Si x systems [14] . The magnetic entropy change Δ S is calculated from magnetization data by using the Maxwell relation Δ S ( T , H ) = ∫ 0 H ( ∂ M / ∂ T ) H d H . Fig. 5 shows the magnetic entropy change as a function of temperature for different magnetic field change. For the samples of LaFe 11.2 Si 1.8 , La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 11.2 Si 1.8 and La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 10.4 Co 0.8 Si 1.8 , the maximum values of Δ S for a magnetic field change from 0 to 2 T and 0 to 5 T at T C are found to be 7.8, 14.4, 4.6 J/kg K and 13.7, 19.4, 9.3 J/kg K, respectively. For the La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 11.2 Si 1.8 , the maximum Δ S is 6.4 J/kg K larger than that of LaFe 11.2 Si 1.8 . The enhancement of Δ S is attributed to the occurrence of the field-induced IEM transition caused by substitution of Pr, which is demonstrated by the asymmetrical broadening of the Δ S peak under high applied field (see Fig. 5 b). It is worthwhile to note that the maximum Δ S of the La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 10.4 Co 0.8 Si 1.8 is nearly as large as that of Gd, which has a Δ S value of 5.0 and 9.0 J/kg K at T C = 294 K for a field change of 0–2 and 0–5 T [18] , respectively. Therefore, the Co-doped La 1− x Pr x Fe 11.2 Si 1.8 compounds are attractive candidates for magnetic refrigerants in an extended high-temperature range even at room temperature. 4 Conclusion In summary, the room-temperature powder XRD patterns show that the LaFe 11.2 Si 1.8 , La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 11.2 Si 1.8 and La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 10.4 Co 0.8 Si 1.8 compounds crystallized in a very clean single phase with a cubic NaZn 13 -type structure. The substitution of Pr for La in LaFe 11.2 Si 1.8 leads to a reduction of the Curie temperature T C . It is found that in LaFe 11.2 Si 1.8 compound with a second-order magnetic transition, the substitution of Pr results in the occurrence of a field-induced IEM transition, which is required by large entropy change. For La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 11.2 Si 1.8 , the maximum value of Δ S is found to 19.4 J/kg K at T C in a magnetic field change from 0 to 5 T, which is 6.4 J/kg K larger than that of LaFe 11.2 Si 1.8 . Substitution of Co for Fe in La 1− x Pr x Fe 11.2 Si 1.8 lifts T C to room temperature, in the meantime driving the magnetic transition from first-order to second-order. The maximum value of Δ S for La 07 Pr 0.3 Fe 10.4 Co 0.8 Si 1.8 is 9.3 J/kg K at T C = 290 K for a field change from 0 to 5 T, which is almost as large as that of Gd. It is worthwhile to point out that no obvious thermal and magnetic hysteresis is observed, which is a promising feature of the present compounds.

The characteristics of solidification microstructure for the alloys at different withdrawing rates were studied. Results show that the microstructure of 46.59Ni-45.61Al-7.8Mo alloy was hypoeutectic at different withdrawing rates. The primary NiAl phase was dendritic; those initial dendrites disappeared gradually as their preferred growth direction did not coincide with the direction of heat transfer during the vertical directional solidification. With increase of the withdrawing rate, the dendrite arm spacing of NiAl phases was decreased little by little. For the 44.86Ni-46.3Al-9.01Mo alloy, eutectic microstructure of rod-like Mo phases inserted in NiAl matrix was formed at different withdrawing rates. With the increase of the withdrawing rate, both of the average spacing and the average diameter of the Mo phases decreased. When the withdrawing rate exceeded 14 mm/h, the continuous and regularly-ranged rod-like Mo-phase turned to irregular and discontinuous. © 2010, Northwest Institute for Nonferrous Metal Research.

Despite its importance, the underlying mechanisms leading to the structural relaxation remain not well understood, especially how it nucleates from amorphous matrix. As natural heterogeneity, the original distributed free volume has been supposed to be associated with the activation of structural relaxation in amorphous solids. However, there has been no direct experimental proof for this hypothesis. Here, we used a colloidal glass to directly observe the structural relaxation and free volume distribution. We found a strong spatial correlation between the structural relaxation and free volume.",

Organically modified TiO2 sol was prepared by roll-coating on OPP foil substrates. The plastic films coated with TiO2 nano-particles were embossed to form surface-relief gratings with micro-structures. The morphology of the porous coatings and the micro-structures were investigated using electron scanning microscopy (SEM). Optical transmission of the films was measured using UV-VIS and IR spectroscopy. The diffraction efficiency of the gratings on the coated plastic foil was examined in terms of fabrication conditions. It was shown that special figures could be seen in the films when the angle of view was changed. The final products of the composite films are transparent and suitable for industry manufacture and applications.",

        "abstract": "A series of stoichiometric NiAl alloys contain four different concentrations of Mo (7.8, 9, 13, 16 at.%) were directionally solidified in the Bridgman-type directional solidification furnace for four different growth rates (V = 1.5–6 μm/s) in a constant temperature gradient (G = 334 K/cm). the microstructures of the alloys produced with the different growth rates at a constant temperature gradient tended to form fully fibrous structures. The fiber spacings λ were measured from transverse section of the specimen. The variation of λ with respect to growth rate (V) and composition (C 0) were determined by linear regression analysis. It has been found that λ decreases with the increasing values of V and C 0. The results are compared with theoretical models and previous experimental published data.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A hybrid cryogenic refrigerator that combines the magnetic refrigeration effect with the GM refrigeration effect has been experimentally studied. ErNi and TmCuAl, which have large magnetocaloric effects, are used to fill the second (low-temperature) stage regenerator of a GM refrigerator and put in a magnetic field varying from 0 to 1.1 T. A phase angle  α  is defined as the phase between the varying magnetic field and displacer movement and can be tuned in order to find the best timing between the magnetic refrigeration and the GM refrigeration cycle. Efforts have also been made to suppress eddy current losses induced due to the varying magnetic field through the cold head. A phase angle of 60° was found to generate best cooling performance through experiments. A minimal no-load temperature of 3.5 K was obtained at 0.5 Hz while the GM refrigeration alone can only generate a no-load temperature of 4.2 K.",

In this review, we describe distinctive pathways of mammalian mitophagy and highlight recent advances relevant to its function in immunity.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Carbon aerogels (CAs) with different microstructure were prepared via ambient pressure drying for capacitive deionization (CDI) of NaCl solution. The activated CAs exhibit a hierarchical porous structure, whose micro-, meso- and macropore size distribution can be varied with the molar ratio of resorcinol to catalyst (R/C). Desalination experiments illustrate that CA electrode with R/C of 200 shows the maximum salt adsorption capacity (SAC) of 10.34 mg/g at a working voltage of 1.5 V. It is found that electrosorption capacity of CA electrodes dose not only depend on the micro-porosity for large surface area but also the mesopores who provide transport channels. A positive-negative alternate adsorption (PNAA) method by alternating the polarity of voltage applied on the electrodes was developed to enhance the desalination capacity. The ultimate SAC of CA electrode with R/C of 200 is 25.45 mg/g, which is more than twice of the adsorption amount for the single adsorption. This method makes full use of the pores of the CAs and provides a further enhancing capacity for CA CDI.",

A facile imaging guidance for the treatment will facilitate its clinical application potential. A type of multifunctional hybrid nanoparticles (h-NPs) has been developed by loading gold nanorods (GNRs) into gadolinium (Gd)–DTPA-conjugated chitosan (Gd–DTPA–CS). Then, the vesicular surface was coated with a PGA-g-mPEG layer via electrostatic adsorption, resulting in GNR/Gd–DTPA–CS@PEG NPs with uniform size distribution, high colloidal stability and bio-safety. In vivo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of tumor bearing mice revealed tumor accumulation of h-NPs administered by intravenous (IV) injection. Under the guidance of MR imaging, the photothermal therapy achieved an effective tumor ablation. Thus, this study showed the potential of h-NPs as a potent photothermal agent for MRI-guided cancer treatment.",

The effects of temperature and types of heavy oils on coals conversion and products, including preasphaltene and asphaltene, were also studied. When reaction time was 60 min, the highest conversion was obtained at 390°and 410°C for Yangcun coal and Daliuta coal, respectively. The conversion followed the order of LTCTD > blended heavy oils > PR. There was no intensive synergy between LTCTD and PR on coal conversion. GC-MS analysis showed that PR mainly consisted of long-chain alkane and LTCTD was mainly derivate of naphthalene. Their interactions with coal were discussed.",

According to the fault sealing mechanism, sands are permeable strata and clay stones are impermeable strata. The paper determines the sedimentary facies and sand content of target stratum and plugged zone using seismic data and regional geological data, and then establishes the lithologic columns on both sides of the fault using random simulation, counts the sealing percentage of every sand layer, and confirms the sealing percentage of the whole reservoir rocks by probability statistics calculation. The results show: the lower content of sand and the more strata reservoir rocks contain, the higher the percentage of the fault sealing sandstones; the lower content of sand and the less strata sealing rocks contain, the higher the percentage of the fault sealing reservoir rocks. The method is applied in the deepwater area of the Pearl River Mouth Basin without wells and indicates that its sealing percentage is 40%-50%.",

The model was proposed as  k   ij   =  w   j   k   i   +  w   i   k   j   ( i  ≠  j ). In the present model, every pure component was considered to have a constant contribution  k   i   to  k   ij  , constant  w   i   is the contribution coefficient of component  j  mixing with component  i .  k   ij   can be determined by summing the contribution coefficient of each pure component times its contribution. By regressing the vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) data of binary mixtures, 119  k   ij   were obtained and used to optimize the constant contribution  k   i   and contribution coefficient  w   i  .  k   ij   of 351 binary systems were predicted and used to describe the VLE data of binary and ternary mixtures. Better performs could be found in the present model than the available models on VLE description of the mixtures.",

The resulting self-supporting monolith with α titanium as the major phase retained the similar morphology of initial template and exhibited a high specific surface area about 99.1 m 2 /g. In addition, as the ideal laser-irradiated target material for production of multi-keV X-rays, the titanium aerogel has successfully realized the voluminal heating when irradiated by the high-energy laser pulse on the Shenguang-II facility, and the Ti K-shell emitted X-ray spectrum ranging from 3 to 9 keV was detected using X-ray elliptical crystal spectrometer. More importantly, the result could provide significant reference for further research about the application of metal aerogel target in the field of the multi-keV X-ray sources, which was essential for radiography of inertial-confinement-fusion (ICF) experiments.",

This study was designed to summarize the MRI manifestation and to evaluate Gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) and super paramagnetic iron oxide particles(SPIO) enhanced MRI in diagnosis of small hepatic carcinoma.Five hundreds patients diagnosed as primary hepatic cell carcinoma histologically were examined by MRI plain scan, plain scan + Gd-DTPA enhanced T1 weighted imaging, and plain scan + Gd-DTPA T1 weighted imaging + SPIO-enhanced heavy T2 weighted imaging was performed, respectively.In 500 patients, there were 65 (13.0%) small hepatic cell carcinoma, 81(16.2%) nodular lesions, 325 (65.0%) lump lesions; 29(5.8%) diffused lesions. 310(62%) patients were single lesion and the rest were multiple lesions. Twelve percent of the cases was associated with lymph nodes metastases, and 31.4% were complicated with vascular invasion. Diameter of the lesion was correlated positively to intro-hepatic metastases of the same or different lobe, the lymph nodes metastases and vascular invasion (P < 0.05). Totally 71 lesions were detected in the 65 cases with small hepatic carcinoma. Enhanced scan detected more lesions than plain scan (P < 0.05), and the lesions detected by Gd-DTPA + SPIO-enhanced scan were more than that by Gd-DTPA alone (P < 0.05).With the diameter of the lesion increase, the possibility of intro-hepatic metastases, lymph node metastases, and vascular invasion increased. For the MRI diagnosis of small HCC, enhanced scan especially Gd-DTPA + SPIO enhanced scan could detect more lesions than plain scan.",

The glassy microstructure was retained after consolidation at room temperature and the strong bonding caused by severe deformation between the particles was responsible for excellent mechanical property of the bulk composites. Furthermore, an Al-based glassy alloy composite gear part was obtained due to the advantage of near-net-shape forming for CHMP.

For samples with x3, the low fraction and isolated Fe-Mn antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling simply align antiparallel to the majority ferromagnetic (FM) order and reduce the total magnetization but cause no noncollinearity; thus they are typical FM materials with TC decreasing drastically from 336 to 226 K and the magnetization has a sharp drop around respective TC without thermal hysteresis suggesting a second order phase transition resulting from their amorphous nature. For x=4 and 5, amorphous alloys Ce2 Fe23-x Mnx B3 experience two transitions: first a paramagnetic (PM)-FM second transition at 143 and 81 K, respectively, and then a FM-spin glass (SG) transition. A PM-SG transition occurs at the freezing temperature (Tf) about 28.2 K for x=6. The SG behavior in amorphous alloy Ce2 Fe23-x Mnx B3 can be attributed to the disordered structure resulting from their amorphous nature and the competition between the Fe-Fe FM coupling and Fe-Mn AFM negative coupling. The magnetic entropy change for alloys Ce2 Fe23-x Mnx B3 with x3 is calculated using the Maxwell relation. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.",

A new TMF generator consisting of three co-coils and a cooling system has been designed and applied successfully. The corresponding radial and axial magnetic field intensity in the inner space of the TMF generator are measured by teslameter. Numerical results indicate that the flow velocity under a downward TMF is smaller than that under an upward TMF. The experimental results demonstrate that α island structures in β matrix are mainly observed under the 6.3 mT and 10.3 mT upward TMF, and the number of α island phase increases with increasing magnetic field intensity. Banded structure is observed under the 6.3 mT and 10.3 mT downward TMF, and the number of bands increases with increasing magnetic field intensity. This should be attributed to the different flow intensity at the interface front under an upward/downward TMF. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Objective: The clinical relevance of femoral marrow MR imaging in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in β-thalassemia major is unknown. This study aims to investigate the value of femoral marrow MR imaging as an alternative risk factor for HSCT in thalassemia major. Methods: MRI of the proximal femur was undertaken in 27 β-thalassemia major patients being prepared for HSCT. Using oblique coronal T1-, T2-weighted spin echo and short-tau inversion recovery images, the area of red marrow and its percentage in the proximal femur were measured. Using in-phase, out-of-phase fast field echo (FFE) images, the degree of proximal femoral marrow hemosiderosis was assessed. Following MRI, HSCT was undertaken in 25 of 27 patients. Red marrow area and degree of marrow hemosiderosis were compared amongst patients with different disease conditions and different transplant outcomes and correlated with clinical features. Logistic regression analyses were used to determine the influence of red marrow area and marrow hemosiderosis on transplant outcome. Results: Marrow hemosidersosis was found in 10 of 27 patients. The marrow hemosiderosis was not correlated with any clinical features (P>0.05) and did not influence the outcome of HSCT (P=0.775). Red marrow area and its percentage correlated positively with the course time of disease (r=0.727, 0.428, P<0.05) and serum ferritin (r=0.487, 0.511, P=0.01, 0.006). Red marrow area and its percentage was less in patients with successful ([7.94±2.71] mm2, 90.25%±4.14%) than unsuccessful transplants ([10.54±3.31] mm2, 94.54%±2.93%)(P=0.04, 0.01). Regression analyses showed that red marrow area percentage was an independent risk factor for successful HSCT (odds ratio of 1.383, P= 0.005). Conclusion: Red marrow area percentage of proximal femur on MRI is an independent risk factor for successful HSCT.",

        "abstract": "A polystyrene (CH)/resorcinol formaldehyde (RF)/CH tri-layer perturbation target for hydrodynamic instability experiments in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) was designed and fabricated and its features were discussed. The target was composed of a perturbed CH layer, a RF aerogel sheet and an unperturbed CH layer. The detailed fabrication method consisted of four steps. An aluminum alloy template with sinusoidal perturbation patterns was prepared by the single-point diamond turning technology; the CH layer was prepared via a simple method which called dip-coating method; the RF aerogel sheet was prepared by sol–gel and supercritical drying process; finally, a CH layer, the RF aerogel sheet and another CH layer were put on the perturbed aluminum alloy template and hot-pressed at 150 °C for 2 h to make these three layers adhered together without the use of adhesive and to transfer the perturbation patterns from the template to the CH layer. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to investigate the microstructure of the RF aerogel sheet. Parameters of the target, such as perturbation wavelength (T) and perturbation amplitude (A), were characterized by QC-5000 tool microscope and alpha-step 500 surface profiler. The results showed that T and A of the target were about 55 and 3.88 μm respectively, the perturbation patterns transferred from the alloy template to the CH layer precisely. Thickness of the perturbed CH layer (H1), RF aerogel sheet (H2) and unperturbed CH layer (H3) and cross-section of the tri-layer target were characterized by QC-5000 tool microscope and SEM. H1, H2 and H3 were about 50, 300 and 20 μm respectively, the cross-sectional photographs of the target showed that the CH layer and the RF aerogel sheet adhered perfectly with each other. As this CH/RF/CH tri-layer target use the RF aerogel to simulate the DT ice of the ignition target capsule, the whole target very close to the actual ignition target capsule.",

It is proposed that the key factors for improving the perforamce characteristics of CNTs/ceramic composites are uniform distribution of CNTs, the surviving of CNTs in the micro-structures, and the interfacial bonding between CNTs and the ceramic matrix.",

It is shown that the liquidus temperature T1 decreases obviously when Ti content (x) increases from 0 to 4, meanwhile the reduced glass temperature (Trg) increases from 0.62 to 0.65. When x exceeds 4, however, T1 increases and Trg decreases respectively with increasing Ti content. The wedge-shaped sample with x = 4 has the largest amorphous region, i.e., has the highest relative glass-forming ability, and the relevant supercooled liquid region ATX is 77.6°C. The alloy with this composition can be cast into cylinder-like amorphous alloy with 10 mm in diameter and 70 mm in length or sheet-like with 3 mm thickness by arc melting and copper mold casting. More intermetallics phases exist in the amorphous-crystallization zone of the wedge-shape sample with x = 4 than those of alloys with x = 0 and x = 2 as indicated by XRD results. It is suggested that the crystallization would be retarded by the interaction and competition of various phases, thus enabling a higher glass-forming ability.",

        "abstract": "Aerogels have many attractive properties but are usually costly and mechanically brittle, which always limit their practical applications. While many efforts have been made to reinforce the aerogels, most of the reinforcement sacrifices the transparency or superinsulating properties. Here we report superflexible polyvinylpolymethylsiloxane (CH2CH(Si(CH3)O2/2))n aerogels that are facilely prepared from a single precursor vinylmethyldimethoxysilane or vinylmethyldiethoxysilane without organic crosslinkers. It is based on consecutive processes involving radical polymerization and hydrolytic polycondensation, followed by ultralow-cost, highly scalable ambient pressure drying directly from alcohol as a drying medium without any modification and additional solvent exchange. The resulting aerogels and xerogels show a homogeneous, tunable, highly porous, doubly crosslinked nanostructure with the elastic polymethylsiloxane network crosslinked with flexible hydrocarbon chains. An outstanding combination of ultralow cost, high scalability, uniform pore size, high surface area, high transparency, high hydrophobicity, excellent machinability, superflexibility in compression, superflexibility in bending and superinsulating properties has been achieved in a single aerogel or xerogel. This study represents a significant progress of porous materials and makes the practical applications of transparent flexible aerogel-based superinsulators realistic.",

        "abstract": "To explore the effect of drainage in cavities on preventing from grade B and C of the pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD).From June 2008 to June 2010, the medical team had performed the operations of digestive tract reconstruction by the same way in 68 cases with PD. There were 43 male and 25 female patients, with a mean age of (64 ± 3) years. The patients were simply randomly divided into drainage in cavities group (DC, n = 32) and conventional drainage group (CD, n = 36) according to the different drainage way. The methods of drainage in cavities were composed of three aspects which include drainage in main pancreatic duct, drainage around cholecystojejunostomy anastomosis and peripancreatic drainage. The clinical parameters of the two groups were collected. The characteristics of the drainage juice which include color, volume and amylase value in the two groups were compared. The incidence and severity grading of pancreatic fistula between the two groups were evaluated.The average of amylase value and the peripancreatic drainage flow were (1401 ± 8) U/L and (49 ± 5) ml in the DC group. Their average in the CD group were (2160 ± 13) U/L and (76 ± 4) ml. There was significant statistical difference in the peripancreatic drainage flow between the two groups (t = 2.597, P = 0.031). The amylase values of the drainage juice between the two groups were of no statistical difference (P > 0.05). According to the definition of pancreatic fistula by an international study group, the incidence of pancreatic fistula in the DC group was 25.0% (8/32) and the CD group 30.5% (11/36) (P > 0.05). The proportion of grades B and C of pancreatic fistula in the DC group had statistical difference compared with one of the CD group (χ(2) = 4.797, P = 0.029).Drainage in cavities could significantly decrease and the occurring ratio of grade B and C of pancreatic fistula after PD.",

The standard uncertainties were estimated to be less than 5 mK for temperature, 600 Pa for pressure, 0.003 for mole fraction, and 0.01% for density. The experimental saturated liquid densities were reproduced by the VDNS and our modified Rackett density equations, while the experimental bubble point pressures were represented with the Patel–Teja (PT) equation of state. Good agreement between values of calculation and experiment were found for both saturated liquid densities and bubble point pressures. In addition, saturated vapor and liquid densities of azeotropy point at temperatures T = (258.150, 263.150, 273.150 and 283.150) K were determined.",

        "abstract": "Microstructural evolution during directional solidification of TiAl alloys grown from Ti-43Al-3Si (at%) seeds was studied. By using an appropriately oriented seed, the TiAl/Ti 3Al lamellar microstructure was aligned parallel to the growth direction at growth rates of 36 and 54 mm/h. When the growth rate reached 90 mm/h, the lamellae could not remain parallel to the growth direction after a certain solidification length. It was found that new β grains nucleate among the original α columnar crystals, and the lamellar orientation changes to an angle of 45° to the growth direction beyond the transition point. Based on the equilibrium binary TiAl phase diagram, the solidification behavior of hypo-peritectic and hyper-peritectic alloys was analyzed. The results suggest that hyper-peritectic alloys should be used as master ingots to obtain a successful seeding of TiAl alloys. Using the nucleation and constitutional undercooling criteria, the nucleation undercooling for the β phase in the Ti-47Al alloy during the seeding procedure was calculated to be 5.74 K at the given temperature gradient of 400 K/cm. Therefore, a high temperature gradient and a low growth rate were required to keep the α phase growing in a stable way and to prevent nucleation of the β phase. Crown Copyright © 2008.",

Results are summarized as follows. 1) The gas speed in the atomizing chamber is changed with the position, and the gas speed in positions far from the exit of the delivery tube is larger than that near positions. 2) When the protrusion length of the delivery tube is shorter than 1 mm, the gas in the delivery tube flows back, which will result in the failure of spray forming process. When the protrusion length of the delivery tube is longer than 1 mm, the gas in the delivery tube flows down, which is of benefit to spray forming process.",

This paper reports the experimental research on the Si/TaSi2 rod-like eutectic composite for field emission. By the Czochralski crystal growth technique, the composite with highly oriented TaSi2 fibres embedded in the (1 1 1) monocrystal n-type Si matrix is obtained. The average fibre diameter is 1.79 μm, the average fibre spacing is 10.0 μm and the average fibre density is 9.25×105/cm2. The fibre distribution characteristic is also studied. The TaSi2 fibres with hexagonal crystal structure present various cross-section shapes. Furthermore, the composite is preferentially etched to form the cone-shaped TaSi2 field emission array protruding above the Si matrix and the field emission property measurement shows that the turn-on field is about 4.4 MV/m which is quite well. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Polar bears have hairs with a membrane-pore structure, which contributes to adaptation to harsh environments. Inspired by polar bear hair, this study reports a facile route to fabricate multifunctional silica nanotube aerogels (SNTAs) via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of silica onto the sacrificial carbon nanoskeleton of a carbon aerogel (CA). The resulting SNTAs are not only porous, nanotubular, transparent, and lightweight but also hydrophobic, thermal resistant, mechanically robust, and machinable. Moreover, SNTAs show relatively high visible and near-infrared light transmittance and almost no ultraviolet and far-infrared light transmittance, which makes it an ideal material to provide greenhouse effects and protect human beings from an overdose of ultraviolet radiation.

        "abstract": "Directional solidification experiments have been carried out in Fe-Ni peritectic alloys to study microstructure evolution in diffusive regime. A numerical modeling of melt convection was developed and discussed to investigate the convective velocity in samples of different diameters. The simulation results show that convection effects can be reduced by decreasing the sample diameter, and diffusion-controlled growth can be achieved if the sample diameter is smaller than about 1 mm. Based on the simulation results, experiments were performed in thin samples of 1 mm diameter to obtain microstructures in diffusive regime. Different kinds of microstructure evolutions were observed in the directionally solidified Fe-Ni alloys. The time-dependent microstructure evolution implies that the solidification process seemed to be in non-steady state rather than in steady state. Based on the transient model, solute distributions in the liquid ahead of the primary and peritectic phases were discussed to reveal the microstructure evolution. Since the solute partition coefficients of the primary and peritectic phases are different, the magnitudes of solute element rejected by the two solid phases are different in two-phase growth conditions. And within the boundary layer, the solute fields ahead of the primary and peritectic phases are different owing to the weak effect of solute mixing in diffusion-controlled regime. Furthermore, microstructure evolution in peritectic alloys was discussed based on the analysis of solute redistribution. © 2012 The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTFriction stir welding (FSW), a highly efficient solid-state joining technique, has been termed as “green” technology due to its energy efficiency and environment friendliness. It is an enabling technology for joining metallic materials, in particular lightweight high-strength aluminum and magnesium alloys which were classified as unweldable by traditional fusion welding. It is thus considered to be the most significant development in the area of material joining over the past two decades. Friction stir processing (FSP) was later developed based on the basic principles of FSW. FSP has been proven to be an effective and versatile metal-working technique for modifying and fabricating metallic materials.

The solidification behaviors of hypo-peritectic and hyper-peritectic alloys in Ti-Al equilibrium phase diagram were studied, and the composition range of successful seeding of TiAl alloys was also determined. Through the lamellar microstructure examination of Ti-47Al alloys directionally solidified from Ti-43Al-3Si seed under the conditions of different growth rates, it was found that a successful seeding requires the solid/liquid interface must be plane during solidification. This can be achieved by growing crystals at a sufficiently high thermal gradient in the liquid and at a sufficiently low growth rate, which made the α phase grown along unpreferred growth orientation of <112̄0>. The seeding process easily failed if β phases precipitated between the α dendrites, which made the lamellar direction change.",

        "abstract": "This paper reviews publications in the literature on performance degradation of and mitigation strategies for polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Durability is one of the characteristics most necessary for PEM fuel cells to be accepted as a viable product. In this paper, a literature-based analysis has been carried out in an attempt to achieve a unified definition of PEM fuel cell lifetime for cells operated either at a steady state or at various accelerated conditions. Additionally, the dependence of PEM fuel cell durability on different operating conditions is analyzed. Durability studies of the individual components of a PEM fuel cell are introduced, and various degradation mechanisms are examined. Following this analysis, the emphasis of this review shifts to applicable strategies for alleviating the degradation rate of each component. The lifetime of a PEM fuel cell as a function of operating conditions, component materials, and degradation mechanisms is then established. Lastly, this paper summarizes accelerated stress testing methods and protocols for various components, in an attempt to prevent the prolonged test periods and high costs associated with real lifetime tests.",

The effect of applied loading rate and sample size on the deformation was studied. It is found that lower loading rate promotes serrations or pop-in events. The gradual disappearance of pop-in events observed on load–displacement (P–h) curves represents a transition from discrete shear band activity at low loading rates to the simultaneous operation of multiple shear bands at higher loading rates. The pop-in size was observed to be load or contact depth dependent. An obvious creep displacement, sensitive to loading rates, was observed during the holding period at the maximum load. The cooling rate employed in sample preparation significantly influences the nano-mechanical properties of the metallic glasses, in that the ribbon sample exhibits lower hardness, incipient plasticity at lower applied load and greater pile-up height than bulk samples.",

The thin films were prepared using the base/acid two-step catalytic sol-gel process and the dip-coating method, and then annealed in the mixed gas of ammonia and water vapor. The films were characterized with TEM, AFM, FTIR, spectrophotometer and ellip sometry, respectively. The experimental results show that the two-step catalysis remarkably strengthens the films, and the scratch-resistance of the silica films is further improved after treatment in the mixed gas. The increase in strength is attributed to the cross-linking of silica particles by the two-step catalysis and the mixed gas treatment. And the films still have low refractive index (1.24) as well as much high transmittance over 99.5%.",

It results in nitrogen doping of ZnO, mainly with chemical states of N2 at oxygen sites, which is demonstrated by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies. The laser treated ZnO NWs show significant improvement in electrical conduction and field emission. Typically, with the critical treated conditions of peak power 400 W and pulse duration 2 ms, NWs with the highest conductivity of 1.43× 10-2 S/cm was obtained. It is one order of magnitude higher than that of the as-prepared NWs (1.20× 10 -3 S/cm). These NWs show better field electron emission properties. The turn-on field is 2.0 MV/m and a current density of 5.3 mA/ cm2 can be obtained at a field of 3.0 MV/m. The underlying mechanisms related to the enhancing effect of conduction and field emission were discussed. The pulsed-laser treatment may be developed toward a technique for application in the study of nanoelectronic devices using NWs. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.",

Pulse field emission of CNT film is investigated to achieve large current and current density. A maximum current of 16 mA is obtained from a 0.02-cm2 CNT film with a current density of 800 mA/cm2. The pulsewidth and area of CNT film have strong effects on field emission characteristics of CNT film, such as total current, current density, and current stability. The reason for this is discussed in detail. The results are useful for the design of the large current and current density CNT cold cathodes.",

Baiyun Sag was composed of a series of half-grabens controlled by the faults in the Wenchang Age of Eocene Epoch, and the sediment of Wenchang Formation was controlled by faults obviously in this period. In the Late Eocene Epoch, Baiyun Sag persisted subsiding and deposited the thick strata of the Oligocene-Miocene, which covered the early structure of half-grabens. In the rift period, the half-grabens controlled the distribution of lacustrine source rocks. Further analysis to half-grabens is favorable to reveal the distribution of source rocks in Wenchang Formation and improve the petroleum exploration in this area.",

By adjusting the amount of CuCl2·2H 2O, CuO/SiO2 composite aerogels with different molar ratio of Cu/Si such as 1, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 35 % was prepared. Finally, via a self-built device and sol-co-gelation technic, a continuous formation process was developed to fabricate the composition-gradient CuO/SiO2 composite aerogel. Density of these aerogels was about 200 mg/cm3, the composition-gradient CuO/SiO2 composite aerogel was cylindrical and about 2.5 cm in height. Scanning electron microscope was used to characterize its microstructure at different position. X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive spectrometer and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer were used to characterize its composition and composition distribution, the results showed that the cylindrical CuO/SiO2 composite aerogel's molar ratio of Cu/Si changed from 31.06 to 4.43 % as the measure point from the bottom up, the whole sample displayed obvious composition-gradient. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

Based on an X-ray diffraction, auger electron spectrum, scanning electron microscope and alpha - step instrument, the evolution of the structure, composition, morphology and thickness of the oxide on tin films has been studied. In the studied temperature region, the growth of the oxide film was found to obey a parabolic growth-rate law with an activation energy of about 0.34 eV, and is controlled by the oxygen diffusion from the loose oxide. It is concluded that the growth of the oxide begins from the formation of a SnO phase, with the increase of the oxidation time, the SnO phase decomposes and a Sn3O4 phase forms due to the SnO thermal and chemical unstability, and the deeper oxidation transfers the Sn3O4 phase to a SnO2 phase.",

        "abstract": "Carbon aerogels have received much recent attention as high-capacity insertion anodes for rechargeable lithium ion batteries. Carbon aerogels were synthesized from resorcinol-formaldehyde with a sodium carbonate catalyst via a sol-gel process, ambient drying, carbonization, and activation. Gaseous CO2 -activated carbon aerogels combined the advantages of amorphous and nanoporous structures, with richer porous structures and more lithium insertion points than conventional carbon aerogels. Microporosity analysis indicated a high surface area, and the pore volume effectively retained lithium and its compounds. The mesoporosity allowed the mass transport of Li + and conferred high ionic conductivity to the electrode. These improvements led to a higher lithium insertion capacity, and the activated carbon aerogel exhibited a specific surface area of 2032 m2·g -1 . X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed an amorphous structure and nanoparticle network skeleton, respectively. Lithium insertion capacities of 3870 and 352 mAh·g -1 were exhibited in the 1st and 50th galvanostatic discharge-charge (50 mA·g -1 ) cycles, respectively. This corresponded to irreversible capacities of 658 and 333 mAh·g -1 , respectively. This work demonstrates the feasibility of CO2 activation for improving lithium insertionperformance in carbon aerogels, and provides preparation and optimization procedures for other porous electrode materials.",

La62Al14Cu12Ni12BMG is introduced as a substitute for silicon which was widely used as mold material for nanofabrication. For the purpose of precise microstructure replication and complete filling, effects of various imprint parameters, including imprint temperature, imprint time and compression load, on formability of La62Al14Cu12Ni12BMG are studied and discussed. Scanning electron microscope images and results of thermal analysis are used to characterize the filling effect of La62Al14Cu12Ni12BMG. In particular, correlations between time and thermodynamic properties are presented. Despite of its high viscosity at crystallization temperature and its narrow supercooled liquid region, La62Al14Cu12Ni12BMG is proved to be a durable and promising material which can precisely replicate the patterns of silicon mold and then transfer its own patterns on Ce69Al10Cu20Co1BMG and PMMA.",

An increase in the strength is always accompanied by a decrease in the plasticity. Here the authors report on a significant enhancement in both compressive strength and plasticity of a Ti-based bulk metallic glass (BMG) deformed at low temperatures. The ductilization of the BMG system can be evidently attributed to the formation of dense shear bands and the rotation mechanism of shear bands. The cryogenic surroundings can effectively slow down the mobility and diffusion of the atoms and consequently, suppress the nucleation and growth of nanocrystals during the deformation process, allowing the simultaneous improvement in the mechanical responses of the glassy alloy to compressive loading far below the ambient temperature.",

One of the most critical challenges introduced by Peer-to-Peer (P2P) based Web services\n is represented by Quality of Service (QoS)-driven services composition. Since many available Peers provide overlapping or\n identical functionalities, though with different QoS, selections need to be quickly made to determine which peers are suitable\n to participate in an expected composite service. The main contribution of this paper is a heuristic approach which effectively\n and adaptively finds appropriate service peers for a service workflow composition, and also some uncertainties in the real\n ad-hoc scenarios are considered by a proper re-planning scheme. We propose to adopt Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) to tackle\n the QoS-aware Peers’ composition problem in both static and dynamic situations, as ACO represents a more scalable choice,\n and is suitable to handle and balance generic QoS attributes by pheromones. The proposed approach is able to improve the selection\n performances in various service composition structures, and also can adaptively handle unexpected events. We present experimental\n results to illustrate the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed method.\n ",

On this basis, a simulation method of network protocol based on CSP (communicating sequential processes) is put forward including the flow chart and nucleus module of simulation. This simulation method starts with the parsing of a CSP document, and then creates a simulation scene of the protocol interaction, finally outputs the simulation results by calling the nucleus module of simulation. A description of TCP (transmission control protocol) is given in this paper which is used as the input to simulate the process of establishing a TCP connection. Visual results are generated after the simulation. These studies show that the method of the protocol formal description and simulation not only has a better theoretical and application value but also lays the foundation of the implementation of automatic protocol development platform.",

Three types of 1D ZnO nanostructures were investigated (i.e., agave-like shape, pencil-like shape, and hierarchical structure) and were prepared by thermal chemical vapor transport and condensation without using any catalyst. The 1D ZnO nanostructures have obvious differences in resistance and thus conductivity from type to type. In addition, in the same type of 1D ZnO nanostructure, each individual emitter may also have variation in resistance and thus in conductivity. The field emission performance of the ZnO emitters was found to be strongly correlated with the resistance of each individual ZnO nanostructure: (i) a ZnO emitter with low resistance will have better emission; (ii) a high resistance region in a ZnO nanostructure is liable to the initiation of a vacuum breakdown event. The results indicate that, besides the uniformity in the geometrical structure, the uniformity in conductivity of the emitters in an array should be ensured, in order to meet the requirement of device application.",

        "abstract": "Fe-based bulk amorphous rods of 3 mm in diameter and a composition of Fe41Cr15Mo14C15B6Y 2Co7 were produced by copper mold casting. The as-cast amorphous rods contain a small (2%) fraction of pores. To close the pores, samples cut from the amorphous rods were hot isostatically pressed (hipped) at 863 K, which is in the supercooled liquid temperature range between the glass transition temperature and the crystallization temperature of the amorphous phase, and under a pressure of 200 MPa. Microstructure examination of the hipped samples shows that hipping results in an increase of the density of the samples from 7.9 g/cm3 to 8.0 g/cm3, and a decrease of the porosity level from 2% to 1%, and that a very small fraction of unknown crystalline phase form. As a result of these microstructure change caused by hipping, the average room temperature compressive fracture strength of the bulk metallic glass (BMG) decrease from 3500 MPa to 3000 MPa, while the strain to fracture changes little from 1.5 % to 1.4 %. The mechanisms of the effect of hipping on microstructure and mechanical properties of the Fe-based BMG are discussed. © World Scientific Publishing Company.",

        "abstract": "Advanced traveller information system is an important intelligent transportation systems application area, which provides information to transport users and managers in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the transportation system, in the face of increasing congestion in urban cities around the world. So far very limited research attention has been focused on long-term travel time prediction (i.e. predicting greater than 60 min ahead). Long-term travel time forecasts can play a critical role in journey planning decisions for both private road users and logistics operators. In this paper, we have considered a fuzzy neural network incorporated with both imprecise and numerical information and developed a hybrid long-term travel time prediction model, which shows the better prediction capability than naive methods and highlights the importance of different data variables. The model combines the learning ability of neural networks and the knowledge extraction ability of fuzzy inference systems. The model was validated by using travel time data compiled from electronic toll tags on a 14 km length section of the CityLink tollway in Melbourne, Australia. The validation results highlight the ability of the fuzzy neural network model to accommodate imprecise and linguistic input information, while providing reliable predictions of travel times up to a few days ahead.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic properties and magnetocaloric effects (MCEs) of the intermetallic RNiIn (R Gd-Er) compounds have been investigated in detail. GdNiIn and ErNiIn compounds exhibit a ferromagnetic (FM) to paramagnetic (PM) transition around the respective Curie temperatures. However, it is found that RNiIn with R Tb, Dy, and Ho undergo two successive magnetic phase transitions with increasing temperature. In addition, a field-induced metamagnetic transition from antiferromagnetic (AFM) to FM states is observed in RNiIn with R Tb and Dy below their respective AFM-FM transition temperatures (Tt). The maximal values of magnetic entropy change (ΔSM) of HoNiIn are -9.5 Jkg K at Tt 7 K and -21.7 Jkg K at TC 20 K for a magnetic field change of 5 T, respectively. These two successive ΔSM peaks overlap partly, giving rise to a high value of refrigerant capacity (RC 341 Jkg at 5 T) over a wide temperature span. It is noted that the RC value of GdNiIn is as high as 326 Jkg due to the relatively broad distribution of ΔSM peak. Consequently, this RNiIn system shows large reversible ΔSM and considerable RC values in the temperature range of 10-100 K. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.",

        "abstract": "Because of ultralow thermal conductivity, excellent catalytic activity, and better heat resistance than silica aerogel, alumina-based aerogel has drawn great interest as thermal insulators and catalysts. However, it is too fragile and sinters above 1000 C (it shrinks drastically, >50%, and leaves the surface area as low as 10-70 m2/g at 1300 C), which badly limits its high-temperature applications. Herein, super heat-resistant, strong alumina aerogels are prepared via a novel acetone-aniline in situ water formation (ISWF) method combined with novel modification techniques: supercritical fluid modification (SCFM) and hexamethyldisilazane gas phase modification. The heat resistance of alumina aerogel is enhanced up to 1300 C via this method. The shrinkage of the optimized alumina aerogel is reduced to as low as 1 and 5% and the corresponding surface area reaches up to 152-261 and 125-136 m2/g after being heated to 1200 and 1300 C for 2 h, respectively. The strength is significantly increased by more than 120% through SCFM. It also exhibits excellent thermal insulation properties at temperatures up to 1300 C. This may significantly contribute to their practical ultrahigh-temperature applications in thermal insulations, catalysts, catalyst supports, etc. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "This research addresses a critical issue of service level agreement (SLA) violation handling, i.e., time constraint violation related to service-based systems (SBS). Whenever an SLA violation occurs to a service, it can potentially impact dependent services, leading to unreliable SBS. Therefore, an SLA violation handling support is much required to produce a robust and adaptive SBS. There are several approaches to realizing exceptions and faults handling support for SBS, focusing on the detection stage, the analysis stage, and the resolution stage. However, the current works have not considered the handling strategy that takes the impact information into account to reduce the amount of change. This is essential to effectively handle the violation while consuming a reasonable recovery execution time. Therefore, in this research, we propose an incremental SLA violation handling with time impact analysis. The main role of the time impact analysis in the approach is to automatically generate an impact region based on the negative time impact conditions. Furthermore, the time impact analysis generates the appropriate time requirements. Both the region and the requirement are useful to support the recovery process. Based on a simplified evaluation study, the outcome suggests that the proposed approach can reduce the amount of service change within a reasonable recovery execution time.",

By resorcinol and formaldehyde's polymerization reaction and via a self-made flexible mould, a series of carbon aerogel sheets were obtained. Their thicknesses range from 80 to 350 μm and densities range from 50 to 600 mg · cm-3. The sheets were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope, X-ray phase contrast imaging method and form Talysurf profiler. The results indicate that the carbon aerogel sheet has the same inner microstructure with the bulk. However, its surface has a dense layer which is obviously different from its inner microstructure. Several materials with different roughness were used to treat the surface and remove the dense layer successfully.",

        "abstract": "Segregation behavior is an important problem in solidification process of alloys, which determines their growth morphologies, phase distributions and concentration segregations so that it affects the mechanical properties of alloys, such as fatigue lives, creep properies, etc.. However, the segregation behaviors of Ni-based superalloys are very complex that contain multi-components and consist of multi-phases. The solute partition coefficient is a key characteristic parameter to express the solute segregation level and tendency in a solidification process. In the present paper, the solute profiles in directionally solidified DZ125 alloy with planar interface growth, which was obtained through experiments of quenching during directional solidification, have been measured by electron probe micro analysis (EPMA). The steady state of solute redistribution hardly reaches due to melt flow during solidification process. The contents of γ′ phase forming elements, Al, Ti, Ta, Mo and Ni, along longitudinal direction increase with the increase of solidified fraction, while those of W, Cr and Co decrease. The results show that the solute partition coefficients of Al, Ti, Ta, Mo and Ni are less than unit, those of W, Cr and Co are more than unit. In addition, the solute distribution in solid phase with dendrite growth is similar to that with planar interface growth. Compared the experimental results of microsegregation with the calculated ones of Scheil model and Brody-Flemings model, the Brody-Flemings model fits better with the experimental results. It indicates that the back-diffusion in solid phase would reduce the microsegregation during dendrite growth. © Copyright.",

The preparation steps involving purified carbon nanotubes were stirred into the nano-WC-Co particles in alcohol using ultrasonic shaker, then ball milled for 60 min. The densification and grain growth behavior, the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites were investigated. Experimental results show that with small amount of carbon nanotube additions, the density of the composites can be enhanced but the grain size has marginal increase; the sintered nanocomposites combine superior hardness to toughness relationships over that of the pure nanocrystalline WC-Co cermets fabricated under the same process. The reasons for the increments can be due to the extraordinary mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes, the toughing and bonding role of carbon nanotubes occurred in the nano-WC-Co matrix, as well as the spark plasma sintering technique used.",

The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence and clinical significance of 14 serum food specific immunoglobulin G (sIgG) antibodies in patients with IBD.This retrospective study comprised a total of 112 patients with IBD, including 79 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 33 with ulcerative colitis (UC). Medical records, clinical data and laboratory results were collected for analysis. Serum IgG antibodies against 14 unique food allergens were detected by semi-quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Food sIgG antibodies were detected in 75.9% (60/79) of CD patients, 63.6% (21/33) of UC patients and 33.1% (88/266) of healthy controls (HC). IBD patients showed the significantly higher antibodies prevalence than healthy controls (CD vs. HC, P = 0.000; UC vs. HC, P = 0.001). However no marked difference was observed between CD and UC groups (P = 0.184). More subjects were found with sensitivity to multiple antigens (≥ 3) in IBD than in HC group (33.9% vs.0.8%, P = 0.000). Egg was the most prevalent food allergen. There was a remarkable difference in the levels of general serum IgM (P = 0.045) and IgG (P = 0.041) between patients with positive and negative sIgG antibodies. Patients with multiple positive allergens (≥ 3) were especially found with significant higher total IgG levels compared with sIgG-negative patients (P = 0.003). Age was suggested as a protective factor against the occurrence of sIgG antibodies (P = 0.002).The study demonstrates a high prevalence of serum IgG antibodies to specific food allergens in patients with IBD. sIgG antibodies may potentially indicate disease status in clinical and be utilized to guide diets for patients.",

        "abstract": "The identification of cervical lymph node metastasis is very important for the treatment and prognosis prediction of lingual squamous cell carcinoma. Simple palpation is unsatisfactory for the accurate diagnosis of cervical lymph node metastasis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been increasingly used to evaluate cervical lymph node status. This study was to explore MRI features of cervical lymph nodes metastasis from lingual squamous cell carcinoma, and to investigate the role of MRI in diagnosing this kind of metastasis.The MR images of 448 nodal levels in 92 patients with lingual squamous cell carcinoma were analyzed, and compared with their pathologic diagnoses.Of the 488 nodal levels, 166 (37.1%) were proved pathologically as metastases, level II was the most commonly involved. False-positive and false-negative rates of MRI diagnoses were higher in levels I, and II than in levels III, IV, and V. There is no statistical difference in the incidence of cervical lymph nodes metastases of different nodal levels between squamous cell carcinoma of corpus linguae and that of radix linguae. Obvious central nodal necrosis was seen in 76 nodal levels at MR images,which were proved pathologically as metastatic nodes. Extracapsular nodal invasions in 34 nodal levels had irregular contour, and infiltration of adjacent fat tissues around lymph nodes, among which carotid artery walls were encased in 2 cases. With the diagnostic criteria of metastasis as the minimal nodal diameter of >/= 8 mm or central nodal necrosis, the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MRI were 79.5%, 90.4%, and 86.4%, respectively.The incidence of cervical lymph nodes metastasis from lingual squamous cell carcinoma is highest in level II. MRI diagnostic criteria of cervical lymph nodes metastasis are nodal size, central nodal necrosis, and irregular contour of lymph nodes. MRI may diagnose lymph node metastasis in levels III-V with high accuracy, While its diagnosis accuracy on levels I-II is affected by the sites, which weakens its clinical value.",

The activation energies Eg, Ex, and Ep, corresponding to characteristic temperatures Tg, Tx, and Tp, respectively, were obtained from the Kissinger and Ozawa equations. The calculated activation energies show good agreement by the Kissinger or Ozawa equations due to the almost invariability of the crystallization volume fraction at the characteristic temperatures for different heating rates.

        "abstract": ". Most preparations for making neural recordings degrade over time and eventually fail due to insertion trauma and reactive tissue response. The magnitudes of these responses are thought to be related to the electrode size (specifically, the cross-sectional area), the relative stiffness of the electrode, and the degree of tissue tolerance for the material. Flexible carbon fiber ultra-microelectrodes have a much smaller cross-section than traditional electrodes and low tissue reactivity, and thus may enable improved longevity of neural recordings in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Only two carbon fiber array designs have been described previously, each with limited channel densities due to limitations of the fabrication processes or interconnect strategies. Here, we describe a method for assembling carbon fiber electrodes on a flexible polyimide substrate that is expected to facilitate the construction of high-density recording and stimulating arrays. . Individual carbon fibers were aligned using an alignment tool that was 3D-printed with sub-micron resolution using direct laser writing. Indium deposition on the carbon fibers, followed by low-temperature microsoldering, provided a robust and reliable method of electrical connection to the polyimide interconnect. . Spontaneous multiunit activity and stimulation-evoked compound responses with SNR > 10 and > 120, respectively, were recorded from a small (125 µm) peripheral nerve. We also improved the typically poor charge injection capacity of small diameter carbon fibers by electrodepositing 100 nm thick iridium oxide films, making the carbon fiber arrays usable for electrical stimulation as well as recording. . Our innovations in fabrication technique pave the way for further miniaturization of carbon fiber ultra-microelectrode arrays. We believe these advances to be key steps to enable a shift from labor intensive, manual assembly to a more automated manufacturing process.",

Wear mechanisms of RS/PM Al-Si and ZL109 alloys were studied. It is shown that the oxidation is dominant in wear of the RS/PM Al-Si alloys, but in wear of the Z1109 alloy, adhesion and plastic stripping is major.",

        "abstract": "With the development and construction of high peak power lasers it has become more and more important to improve the laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) of optical coatings. In this paper, ZrO(2) coatings were deposited by sol-gel dip-coating method and further treated by conventional furnace annealing (CFA) and rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at different temperatures. By measuring the Raman spectra, optical constants and LIDT, the influence of annealing on the crystal structures, refractive indices, laser-induced damage characters of ZrO(2) coatings were analyzed. The results show that RTA is effective in tuning the crystal structures of ZrO(2) coatings. Lattice mismatch between monoclinic and tetragonal phases happened on CFA treated film reduces its refractive index, hence the film annealed by RTA at 800 °C realizes a higher refractive index. Compared with CFA annealed films, RTA annealed films were no more susceptible to laser damage due to their crystal structure difference caused lager band gap.",

When PEG was added before the addition of the catalyst, the particle size increased from 10 nm (in sol without PEG) to 20 nm, and the necessary aging time for dip coating was shortened from 5 days (in sol without PEG) to ~30 h. When PEG was added 24 h later than the catalyst, the uniform sol structure and small particle unit were obtained. With the delay of the PEG addition timing to 120 h, the improvement in the homogeneity of the sol was continued, whereas the porosity of the resulting coatings decreased. The refractive index of PEG-modified SiO2 coatings can be adjusted in a continuous range between 1.14 and 1.20, using the timing when the PEG was added. The highest peak transmittance of glass that was coated with PEG-modified silica coatings reached 99.90%. All the coatings can be changed from hydrophilic to hydrophobic after hexamethyldisilazane vapor modification.",

        "abstract": "In vivo tracking cells using gadolinium-based contrast agents have the important advantage of providing a positive contrast on T1-weighted images, which is less likely to be confused with artifacts because of postoperative local signal voids such as metal, hemorrhage, or air. The aim of this study is to paramagnetically and fluorescently label marrow with dual agents (gadolinium-diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid [Gd-DTPA] and PEI-FluoR) and track them after transplantation into spinal cord injury (SCI) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from Sprague-Dawley rats were incubated with PEI-FluoR (rhodamine-conjugated PEI-FluoR) and Gd-DTPA complex for labeling. After labeling, cellular viability, proliferation, and apoptosis were evaluated. T1 value and longevity of intracellular Gd-DTPA retention were measured on a 1.5 T MRI scanner. Thirty-six SCI rats were implanted with labeled and unlabeled MSCs and phosphate-buffered saline. Then, serial MRI and Basso-Beattie-Bresnehan (BBB) locomotor tests were performed and correlated with fluorescent microscopy. The relative signal intensity (RSL) of the engraftment in relation to normal cord was measured and the linear mixed model followed by post-hoc Bonferroni test was used to identify significant differences in RSL as well as BBB score.MSCs could be paramagnetically and fluorescently labeled by the dual agents. The labeling did not influence the cellular viability, proliferation, and apoptosis. The longevity of Gd-DTPA retention in labeled MSCs was up to 21 days. The distribution and migration of labeled MSCs in SCI lesions could be tracked until 7 days after implantation on MRI. The relative signal intensities of SCI rats treated with labeled cells at 1 day and 3 days (1.34 +/- 0.02, 1.27 +/- 0.03) were significantly higher than rats treated with unlabeled cells (0.94 +/- 0.01, 0.99 +/- 0.02) and phosphate-buffered saline (0.91 +/- 0.01, 0.95 +/- 0.01) (P < .05). Rats treated with labeled MSCs or unlabeled MSCs achieved significantly higher BBB scores than controls at 14, 21, 28, and 35 days after injury (P < .05).Labeling MSCs with the dual agents may enable cellular MRI and tracking in experimental spinal cord injury.",

        "abstract": "To solve the maximum lifetime broadcast routing problem in wireless ad hoc networks where each node is equipped with single-beam directional antennas, a maximum-lifetime broadcast tree construction algorithm based on particle swarm optimization is proposed. In this algorithm, each particle position represents a broadcast tree, and the particle fitness is the lifetime of the broadcast tree represented by the particle position. During the searching process of the particle swarm, a number of measures are adopted to improve the solving quality and efficiency. When each particle's position is updated, the new position of each particle is constrained so that each node's lifetime is not less than a threshold. The particle population management strategy of the EPUS-PSO(efficient population utilization strategy for particle swarm optimization) is used, therefore some new particles can be added into the swarm or some existing particles can be excluded from the swarm according to the solution-searching status. The solution-sharing strategy of the EPUS-PSO is used, therefore each particle can share other particles' personal best positions. The heuristic algorithm which iteratively improves the lifetime of a broadcast tree is adopted to locally optimize the particle position. Meanwhile, the damping boundary condition is used to deal with every particle's boundary violation. The results of the simulation experiments show that the proposed approach can effectively increase the broadcast lifetime.",

        "abstract": "The industrial organism Corynebacterium glutamicum is often subjected to acid stress during large-scale fermentation for the production of bio-based chemicals. The capacity of the cells to thrive in acidic environments is a prerequisite for achieving high product yields. In this study, we obtained an acid-adapted strain using an adaptive laboratory evolution strategy. Physiological characterizations revealed that the adapted strain achieved improved cell viability after acid-stress challenge, with a higher cytoplasmic pH level, a lower intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and an enhanced morphological integrity of the cells, when compared to those of the original control strain. Transcriptome analysis indicated that several important cellular processes were altered in the adapted strain, including sulfur metabolism, iron transport, and central metabolic pathways. Further research displayed that KatA and Dps cooperatively mediated intracellular ROS scavenging, which was required for resistance to low-pH stress in C. glutamicum. Furthermore, the repression of sulfur assimilation by the McbR regulator also contributed to the improvement of acid-stress tolerance. Moreover, two copper chaperone genes cg1328 and cg3292 were found to be involved in promoting cell survival under acid-stress conditions. Finally, a new recombinant C. glutamicum strain with enhanced acid tolerance was generated by the combined overexpression of katA, dps, mcbR, and cg1328, showing 18.4 ± 2.5% higher biomass yields than the wild-type strain under acid-stress conditions. These findings will provide new insights into the understanding and genetic improvement of acid tolerance in C. glutamicum.",

        "abstract": "The distributions of magnetic flux densities of two kinds of induction coil with a trumpet inside wall and with a vertical inside wall have been measured by means of a detection coil and a position system. The shape and size of liquid metal meniscus were determined by measuring the quenched metal meniscus under electromagnetic pressure. By comparing the induction coil with a vertical inside wall and that with a trumpet inside wall, it was found that the later had a steeper distribution of magnetic flux density along axis. The electromagnetic pressure acting on the surface of liquid metal meniscus with a vertical periphery was nearer to the static pressure produced by liquid metal column. The vertical periphery of meniscus ensured the following advantages: uniform cross-section, smooth surface, good coupling with temperature field and steady processing. In this kind of coil the maximum magnetic flux density was at the bottom; thus it was easier for the induction coil to contain the liquid metal column when the position of S/L interface fluctuated during this processing. In addition, experimental results show that the magnetic flux density of coil with round cross section was nonuniform, it was found that square cross section was much better. There appeared a reduced flux density at the region between coil turns that caused a fluctuation of electromagnetic pressure on the surface of liquid metal and caused the sample to be nonuniform in cross-section and the surface to be not smooth.",

        "title": "Hydrogen crossover in high-temperature PEM fuel cells",
        "abstract": "In this paper, hydrogen crossover was measured in an environment of high-temperature proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells using a steady-state electrochemical method at various temperatures ( T ) (80–120 °C), backpressures ( P ) (1.0–3.0 atm), and relative humidities (RH) (25–100%). An H 2 crossover model based on an MEA consisting of five layers – anode gas diffusion layer, anode catalyst layer, proton exchange membrane (Nafion 112 or Nafion 117), cathode catalyst layer, and cathode gas diffusion layer – was constructed to obtain an expression for H 2 permeability coefficients as a function of measured H 2 crossover rates and controlled H 2 partial pressures. The model analysis suggests that the dominant factor in the overall H 2 crossover is the step of H 2 diffusing through the PEM. The H 2 permeability coefficients as a function of T , P , and RH obtained in this study show that the increases in both T and P could increase the H 2 permeability coefficient at any given RH. However, the effect of RH on the permeability coefficient seems to be more complicated. The T effect is much larger than that of P and RH. Through experimental data simulation an equation was obtained to describe the T dependencies of the H 2 permeability coefficient, based on which other parameters such as maximum permeability coefficients and activation energies for H 2 crossover through both Nafion 112 and 117 membranes were also evaluated. Both Nafion 112 and Nafion 117 showed similar values of such parameters, suggesting that membrane thickness does not play a significant role in the H 2 crossover mechanism.

In the apparatus, a helium-gas-filled alfa-type Stirling refrigerator uses Gd sheets as the regenerator and the regenerator is put in a magnetic field varying from 0 to 1.4 T, which is provided by a Halbach-type rotary permanent magnet assembly. With an operating pressure of 5.5 MPa and a frequency of 2.5 Hz, a no-load temperature of 273.8 K was reached in 9 minutes, which is lower than that of 277.6 K for pure Stirling cycle. For the hybrid operation, cooling powers of 40.3 W and 56.4 W were achieved over temperature spans of 15 K and 12 K, respectively. For the latter case, the cooling power improves by 28.5% if compared with that exploiting only the Stirling cycle refrigeration effect.",

With slight Ba-doping, the antiferromagnetic ordering of pure EuTiO 3  can be significantly changed to ferromagnetic due to the size Ba 2+  ion bigger than Eu 2+ . A giant reversible magnetocaloric effect and large RC in Eu 1−x Ba x TiO 3  compounds were observed. The maximum value of magnetic entropy change (−Δ S   M    max  ) reaches to 41.4 J/kg K for Eu 0.92 Ba 0.08 TiO 3  under the magnetic field change of 5 T. Especially, under the magnetic field changes of 1 and 2 T, the values of −Δ S   M    max   are evaluated to be 12.5 and 23.4 J/kg K and the maximum values of RC are 54 and 119 J/kg, without magnetic and thermal hysteresis for Eu 0.92 Ba 0.08 TiO 3 . Therefore, the giant reversible magnetocaloric effect and large RC make the Eu 1−x Ba x TiO 3  compounds could be considered as a good candidate material for low-temperature and low-field magnetic refrigerant.",

The micro-structure and thermal properties of the alumina aerogels were analyzed by SEM, XRD, FT-IR, thermal analyser (Hotdisk) and pore size distribution analyser. The heat transfer mechanism was explained from different aspects of aerogels' micro-structure. The results show that the alumina aerogels prepared by this method are materials with obvious polycrystalline of boehmite phase and nano-sized multi-hole network structure with spherical particles, which grately reduced the gas and solid thermal conductivity. The total thermal conductivity of the aerogels obtained is 0.020 W/m·K at room temperature. © right.",

        "abstract": "For the phase and microstructure selection during directional solidification of peritectic alloys, the solute distribution ahead of the solid-liquid interface plays a fundamental role. To study the solute distribution under convection condition, the convection factor (Δ) was introduced into the boundary layer model and Bower-Brody-Flemings model and the solute distribution ahead of the planar and cellular interfaces under convection condition during directional solidification were obtained. Based on these solute distributions, the nucleation and constitutional undercooling criterion and the assumption that the maximum interface growth temperature of phase growth is more stability during directional solidification, the nucleation conditions of new phase ahead of the growth interface under convection condition were analyzed and the phase and microstructure selection map in directionally solidified peritectic alloys under convection condition was developed. Compared with the Hunziker's model that is suit for the phase and microstructure selection of peritectic alloys under diffusive condition and the Karma's model that is used to explain the banded structure formation under convection condition, this model can return to the Hunziker's model under diffusive condition and include the Karma's model. Additionally, this model can predict the mixed banded structure and the coupled growth between the cellular primary phase and planar peritectic phase that can form under convection condition, which these models cannot display. In order to estimate the validity of this model, directional solidification experiments of Sn-1.6%Cd (mass fraction) peritectic alloy were carried out under different convection conditions. The results show that the experimental results are in agreement with the calculated results. That is, this model can explain the complex directional solidification microstructures of peritectic alloys appropriately. © right.",

Solution-processed small-molecule OLEDs can be a potential approach and its development needs more intensive studies. Meanwhile, the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) materials have been studied promising candidates for high performance OLEDs. Recently, we have synthesized the AIE materials with good solubility, high thermal stability and facile process. To assess the feasibility of developing solution processing and to fabricate OLEDs based on these AIE materials, in this study the underlying nature of the solution-processed thin films is initiated compared to that of vacuum-deposited counterparts. Here, the characteristics of thin films as prepared by solution processing, such as the photophysical property, morphology, molecular packing density and band structure, are given. The results show that the quality of solution-processed films is similar to that of their vacuum-deposited analogues. It demonstrates that one can employ the solution-processed method to prepare the high performance light emitting thin films using the AIE materials, we have developed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometer(GC-MS)was used to measure components of total volatile organic compound(TVOC). The experiment result showed that increasing temperature, RH and ACH accelerated VOC emission from plywood. The influence of environmental factors on VOC emission was only significant for initial emission. Few days later, the effect was not obvious. Arene compounds were the main compounds of TVOC emission from plywood, and the content of alkane compounds were the second. The emission rate of arene compounds was higher than that of alkane compounds. Environmental factors affected arenas compounds emission rate more obviously than alkane compounds. Toluene emission rate was the highest, m,p-xylene was the second, and the ethylbenzene was third. The influence of environmental factors on these three compounds had no major differences.",

The results show that the maximum thickness of amorphous region of wedge-shaped samples are dm = 2mm for A 1, dm = 3.5mm for Vit105, and the evaluated critical cooling rates are Rc = 33.5 and 4.5K/s for A1 and Vit105, respectively. It is suggested that the glass forming ability of A1 is smaller than that of well known Vit105 alloy, though A1 has the significant supercooled liquid region of over 140K. Therefore, it is concluded that a large supercooled liquid region ΔTx does not necessarily mean good glass forming ability of an amorphous alloy. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The main idea of this approach is that significant excitation amplitudes can be approximately obtained by solving the coupled cluster (or Møller-Plesset perturbation theory) equations of a series of \"clusters,\" each of which contains a subset of occupied and virtual LMOs. In the present implementation, we have proposed a simple approach for constructing virtual LMOs of clusters, and new ways of constructing clusters and extracting the correlation contributions from calculations on clusters, which are more efficient than those suggested in the original work. More importantly, linear scaling of computational time of the CIM approach is achieved by evaluating the transformed two-electron integrals over LMOs using simple truncation techniques in limited operations (independent of the molecular size). With typical thresholds, for a variety of molecules our test calculations demonstrate that more than 99% of the conventional MP2 or coupled cluster with doubles correlation energies can be recovered in the present CIM approach. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.",

        "abstract": "Mixed-valence vanadium oxide nanotubes (VO x-NTs) are successfully prepared with dodecylamine as the templates intercalated between VO x layers. A novel ferric ion exchange technique is carried out to remove the amine templates which have no contribution to electrochemical performance of VO x-NTs. TEM observation, XRD study, and FTIR analysis reveal that a large proportion of the amine templates within VO x-NTs can be exchanged by ferric ions in the reaction process, and the tubular morphology and multiwalled structure are not damaged by this exchange technique. Moreover, XPS results indicate that the ferric ion exchange process is also accompanied by the increase of vanadium valence, which is conducive to the improvement of electrochemical capacity of Fe-VO x-NTs. The final synthesized Fe-VO x-NTs exhibit superior specific capacity (311 mAh g -1 at 50 mA g -1 discharge current density in the potential range of 1.5-4 V versus Li/Li +) and cycling performance (178 mAh g -1 after 50 cycles) compared to congeneric modified materials when used as cathode materials for lithium ion batteries. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Stable electron emission from amorphous diamond film at a low threshold field of 6-7 mV m-1 has been observed using a transparent anode technique. The electron emission characteristics are discussed in terms of the structural properties of films. Using scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectra, the emitting and the non-emitting regions of the amorphous diamond film are analyzed. The emitting regions exhibit rougher microstructure in morphology and a stronger Raman peak at 1360 cm-1 than the non-emitting regions, a signature of having more micro-sp2 components. It is suggested that field emission is prone to take place at the regions containing more sp2 nanoclusters or nanocrystalline graphite.",

Spectroscopic ellipsometer and FE-SEM were used to characterize the optical properties and surface microstructure of nano-porous SiO2 film.

The film optical constants in 300-700 nm waveband are obtained and the relation between microstructure and optical constants is also discussed. The difference of microstructure has no effect on the dispersion relation of the films while it has effect on the value of the optical constants.

RF/SiO 2 aerogels were pyrolyzed to C/SiO 2 aerogels at high temperature. SiC aerogels were successfully converted from C/SiO 2 aerogels by a template-confined magnesiothermic reaction at low temperature (700°C). The samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, Raman, FTIR and BET. The results suggest that the products consist of nanocrystalline silicon carbide, and maintain 3D porous network as similar as that of original templates. They possess a bulk density of 130 mg/cm 3 and a specific surface area of 230 m 2/g. Potentially, the proposed method could be expanded to convert other carbon/metal or semimetal oxide aerogels to carbide aerogels, which could be benefit for investigation of ICF experimental targets.",

The GeO2 concentration of the binary aerogels can be ranging from 0% up to almost 80%. But with the increase of GeO2 concentration, the strength and transparency of the binary aerogel decrease dramatically. The specific surface, pore distribution as well as the network structures are also changing with the change of the GeO2 content.

The population was classified as having adequate or excessive iodine intake according to the iodine concentration in drinking water. Demographic information was collected by questionnaire. Levels of serum thyroid hormones, thyroid autoantibodies and iodine in drinking water and urine were measured.Villages with adequate or excessive drinking water iodine in Hebei Province, People's Republic of China.A total of 854 men and women aged 20-50 years who had lived in the surveyed areas for over 5 years, including 348 from the adequate iodine area (AIA) and 506 from the excessive iodine area (EIA).Median urinary iodine concentration was 185 μg/l in AIA and 1152 μg/l in EIA. The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in AIA was 10·3 %, which included 1·1 % with hypothyroidism and 8·1 % with subclinical hypothyroidism; and 20·6 % in EIA, which included 3·6 % with hypothyroidism and 13·6 % with subclinical hypothyroidism. The positive rates of thyroglobulin antibody were 16·1 % in AIA and 11·9 % in EIA; the positive rates of thyroperoxidase antibody were 20·7 % in AIA and 16·4 % in EIA.Excessive iodine intake may lead to increased prevalence of biochemical thyroid dysfunction, especially biochemical hypothyroidism. This is not related to an increase in prevalence of thyroid antibodies. Women are more susceptible to iodine excess.",

        "abstract": "The Wanyaogou Fault dislocates the Jurassic sandstone. The tilted bedrock becomes a natural barrier to the groundwater, and a water-rich stratum formed in the footwall which caused obvious resistance difference between the two walls of the fault. The electrical imaging is an effective way to detect the fault on this condition. The experimental electrical resistivity tomography survey was conducted, to detect the Wanyaogao Fault. The results of 2-D resistivity inversion indicate that the electrical structures on both sides of the fault present obvious difference, the resistivity of the hanging wall is high,while that of the foot wall is low. And the interface of the high and low resistance regions inclines to the low resistance region. The electrical resistivity tomography survey was also conducted to detect other faults in Urmuqi which have similar tectonic characteristics with Wanyaogou Fault. And the electrical structures appear the similar abnormality. So the abnormal characteristic is an important indicator and basis for identification of fault in the Urumqi region. The faults in Urmuqi are almost all high-obliquity reverse faults. After comparing the electrical imaging with the trench section, we find the fault is not coincident with the borderline between the high and low resistance, but lies in the high resistance region. The fault inclination is reverse to the gradient direction of isolines. The fault location is near to the inflexion of the upper isolines.",

The melt convection was modulated by traveling magnetic field. When the direction of traveling magnetic field was changed from upward to downward, the primary dendrite spacing gradually increased, and the distribution peak of the primary dendrite spacing shifted to the field of narrower spacing. These result from the different intensities of melt convection, which are controlled by the traveling magnetic field. The effects of the traveling magnetic field on melt convection are similar to those of adjustment in the gravity level, thus, the primary dendrite spacing varies. When the intensity of the traveling magnetic field was 1 mT, and the drawing speed was 50 μm/s, the gravity acceleration reached 0.22g for the downward-traveling magnetic field and 3.07g for the upward-traveling magnetic field. © 2011 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.",

        "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are long, non-coding RNAs that result from the non-canonical splicing of linear pre-mRNAs. However, the characteristics and the critical role of circRNA in co-/post-transcriptional regulation were not well recognized until the \"microRNA sponge\" function of circRNA is discovered. Recent studies have mainly been devoted to the function of the circular RNA sponge for miR-7 (ciRS-7) and sex-determining region Y (SRY) by targeting microRNA-7 (miR-7) and microRNA-138 (miR-138), respectively. In this review, we illustrate the specific role of circRNAs in a wide variety of cancers and in regulating the biological behavior of cancers via miR-7 or miR-138 regulation. Furthermore, circRNA, together with its gene silencing ability, also shows its potential in RNA interference (RNAi) therapy by binding to target RNAs, which provides a novel perspective in cancer treatment. Thus, this review concerns the biogenesis, biological function, oncogenesis, progression and possible therapies for cancer involving circRNAs.",

        "abstract": "Big Data is immersed in many disciplines, including computer vision, economics, online resources, bioinformatics and so on. Increasing researches are conducted on data mining and machine learning for uncovering and predicting related domain knowledge. Protein-protein interaction is one of the main areas in bioinformatics as it is the basis of the biological functions. However, most pathogen-host protein-protein interactions, which would be able to reveal much more infectious mechanisms between pathogen and host, are still up for further investigation. Considering a decent feature representation of pathogen-host protein-protein interactions (PHPPI), currently there is not a well structured database for research purposes, not even for infection mechanism studies for different species of pathogens. In this paper, we will survey the PHPPI researches and construct a public PHPPI dataset by ourselves for future research. It results in an utterly big and imbalanced data set associated with high dimension and large quantity. Several machine learning methodologies are also discussed in this paper to imply possible analytics solutions in near future. This paper contributes to a new, yet challenging, research area in applying data analytic technologies in bioinformatics, by learning and predicting pathogen-host protein-protein interactions.",

The stripping section of the distillation column and generator were replaced by a generator with temperature-distributed heat sources. The heat sources were distributed throughout the entire process in the generator, so the mass and heat transfer were coupled at different temperatures, which increased the waste heat utilization at low temperatures. Compared with a traditional system, temperature–distributed heat sources increased the utilization temperature range. In the simulation of the system, the condition at cold end kept unchanged while the heating distributions and quantity inside the generator were changed. The performance of the new generator driven by temperature-distributed heat sources was analyzed while compared with a traditional system through the coefficient of performance, separation efficiency and waste heat utilization.",

The main results can be summarized as follows: (i) As thef, a and μγ are large enough, causing the ratio of melt thickness to current skin deptha/ δ to be larger than 2.2,p will be a constant (p = 1) and the electromagnetic pressure can be calculated withP\n m =B\n 2/2μ. (ii) As thef, a, and μγ are not large enough, and the ratioa/ δ is less than 2.2,p is no longer a constant but changes from 1 to 0 with the decrease ofa/δ.

The preparation of multilayer aerogel was studied, which included controlling the microstructure as well as the interface effect between aerogels and environment. Any extra glue was used in the preparation which included sol-gel techniques and supercritical drying. The problem of dense layer that always appeared on the surface of aerogel during the preparation was studied, and effectively overcome by modifying the mold with ammonia. Meanwhile the shrinkage effect of aerogel was studied and well controlled, as a result the cracking and curling of samples were avoided effectively. Finally, qualified samples with thickness of ~ hundreds μm and density of 0.20–1.56 g/cm 3  were obtained. As a preliminary experiment, a two-layer aerogel graded density was used to impact Al target, and a piece of isopachous polystyrene with single density was used as contrast. Consequently the aerogel flyer-plate with graded density was accelerated by laser beam, and impacted Al target with extending the rising edge of ramp compression by 50% in comparison to the contrast. Further work is focusing on optimizing the density range of aerogels and improving their properties.",

However, there are limited studies investigating the factors that influence cloud computing adoption within Australian SMEs. To fill the research vacuum, we developed a research model based on the diffusion of innovation theory (DOI), the technology-organisation-environment (TOE) framework, and our prior exploratory study to investigate the determinants that influence the adoption of cloud computing. An organizational-level survey was conducted across Australia to collect data from technology decision makers in SMEs. Data collected from 203 firms are used to test the related hypotheses. This study contributes a statistically validated model of the influential determinants of cloud computing adoption. Data analysis indicates that Technological Factors (cost savings, relative advantages, compatibility, and trialability), Organizational Factors (firm size, top management support, innovativeness of the firm, and IS knowledge), and Environmental Factors (market scope and external computing support) were found to be determinants of the adoption of cloud computing services. Benefits of the findings are twofold. First, they provide knowledge about cloud computing determinants in the Australian marketplace. Second, they provide policy planners and SMEsu0027 decision makers with insights and directions for successful adoption of cloud computing technology.",

        "abstract": "It is great important that the mechanical, thermal properties and structure of extreme density carbon aerogel will directly affect its application scope, since carbon aerogel with adjustable structure and density are designed as a conventional target in ICF research and X laser experiment. Low-density (36 mg/cm3) resorcinol-formaldehyde carbon aerogel was fabricated by improving the traditional synthesis technique and adjusting the parameters of reactants. Field emission scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffractometer, BET and simultaneous thermal analyzer were used to observe the microstructure of low-density carbon aerogel, while dynamic mechanical analyzer, electronic tensile tester and thermal constant analyzer were used to characterize its properties. The research shows that the low-density carbon aerogel processes the unique pearl necklace-like nano network with homogametic nanoparticle of about 70 nm. Its specific surface area is 1217 m2/g before activation. It is a perfect elastic material with stable mechanical properties. Its Young's modulus is only 0.375 MPa from -120°C to 200°C, much less than that of the regular density carbon aerogel. Its thermal conductivity is as low as 0.05 W/(m·K) at ambient conditions, which has been greatly improved from the conventional carbon aerogels.",

        "abstract": "NiAl9Mo (at%) eutectic alloy was produced by a Bridgman type crystal growing facility with Zone Melting Liquid Metal Cooling technique at the growth rate range from 60 to 200 μm/s. The variation of rod eutectic spacing with growth rates was characterized. Statistical distributions of spacings at each growth rate were also determined. It was confirmed that the relationship between growth rate V and rod spacing λ follows the Jackson and Hunt equation under high growth rates and can be obtained as λ2V=33.94 μm3/s. In addition, a narrow distribution curve of the rod spacing was obtained for a given growth rate. And the width of the distribution decreases as the growth rate increases. It is probable that the capillarity effect, the high value of entropy of fusion constituent phase NiAl and the convection effect are responsible for the existence of the narrow band of the rod spacing. © 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "Hypoxia leads to up-regulation of PD-L1 and decreases T lymphocyte infiltration, thus boosting immunotherapeutic resistance of tumors. Moreover, tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) correlate with potent immune suppressive activity and resistance to the immune checkpoint blocking (ICB) in tumor sites. Here, a multifunctional nanoregulator incorporating MnO particles and small molecular IPI549 is developed, which can reshape the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) to unleash the immune system. The intravenously administered nanoregulator effectively accumulates in tumor sites to alleviate hypoxia via oxygen-generating reduction of MnO and to inhibit PI3Kγ on MDSCs via IPI549 release in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which results in concurrent downregulation of PD-L1 expression, polarization of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) toward pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype (tumor-suppressive), enhanced infiltration of CD4 helper T lymphocytes (Th cells), and cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes (Tc cells), and suppressed infiltration of regulatory T lymphocytes (T cells) for effective tumor immunotherapy. Furthermore, the local generation of Mn in TME allows tumor-specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). More excitingly, the nanoregulator-reshaped TIME is effectively reserved due to the synergistic effect of hypoxia alleviation and MDSC PI3Kγ inhibition, leading to remarkable post-medication inhibition of tumor re-growth and metastasis in an animal study.",

        "abstract": "Populus davidiana wood was usually impregnated with low molecular weight thermosetting resins to improve its physical and mechanical properties. However, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and formaldehyde emitted from treated wood have lead to poor indoor air quality (IAQ). The trends of VOC and formaldehyde emissions as a function of the weight percent gain (WPG) factor were mainly investigated in this work. Aldehydes and alkanes were the predominant compositions indentified in the VOC emissions, although low amount of ketones, terpenes and alcohols were also found. With the increase in WPG, VOC and formaldehyde concentrations improved. However, their concentration began to decrease when WPG was over 44.06% (VOC) and 36.35% (formaldehyde), respectively. The modulus of elasticity (MOE) of untreated and treated wood at different WPG levels was detected. It showed that treatment of wood with UF resin significantly improved the mechanical properties. Therefore, it is probably helpful to comprehensively analyze correlations among environmental performance, mechanical performance and processing costs.",

        "abstract": "Sparse sequences of neuronal activity are fundamental features of neural circuit computation; however, the underlying homeostatic mechanisms remain poorly understood. To approach these questions, we have developed a method for cellular-resolution imaging in organotypic cultures of the adult zebra finch brain, including portions of the intact song circuit. These in vitro networks can survive for weeks, and display mature neuron morphologies. Neurons within the organotypic slices exhibit a diversity of spontaneous and pharmacologically induced activity that can be easily monitored using the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6. In this study, we primarily focus on the classic song sequence generator HVC and the surrounding areas. We describe proof of concept experiments including physiological, optical, and pharmacological manipulation of these exposed networks. This method may allow the cellular rules underlying sparse, stereotyped neural sequencing to be examined with new degrees of experimental control.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To investigate the clinical features of multiple primary cancers(MPC ) associated with bladder cancer in elderly patients.Methods:The records of 21 elderly patients with MPC associated with bladder cancer treated in our hospital from August 1997 to August 2011 were reviewed.Results:Out of 1,415 bladder cancer patients treated contemporarily,21(1.48%) were diagnosed with MPC associated with bladder cancer through biopsy.The overall survival rate of elderly patients with this condition was 76.2%.Six patients suffered from MPC associated with bladder cancer in the first seven years.Fifteen patients suffered from this disease in the next seven years. A total of 9 of the 21 elderly patients with MPC associated with bladder cancer suffered from other neoplasms involving the urinary system, including 5 in the digestive system,3 in the respiratory system,2 in the genital system,and 2 in other systems.In addition,9 elderly patients were confirmed of having synchronous MPC associated with bladder cancer:4 died,and 5 survived after 48 months follow-up.The other 12 patients suffered from metachronous MPC associated with bladder cancer:1 elderly patient died,and the remaining 11 were followed up for 53 to 144 months after treatment for the first carcinoma.The cumulative survival rates of the elderly patients with synchronous and metachronous MPC associated with bladder cancer were significantly different.Therefore,the tumor staging of MPC associated with bladder cancer in elderly patients is closely associated with the survival rates.Conclusion:The incidence of MPC associated with bladder cancer in elderly patients is increasing.The other neoplasms of this disease in elderly patients are frequently found in the urinary,digestive,and respiratory systems.The cumulative survival rate in elderly patients with metachronous MPC associated with bladder cancer is higher than that of the synchronous type.The high tumor staging of this disease in elderly patients is closely associated with the low survival rates.Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of malignant neoplasms may be the only approach to achieving long-term survival.",

        "abstract": "The excellent properties of silicon carbide (SiC) make it widely applied in high-voltage, high-power, and high-temperature electronic devices. SiC nanowires combine the excellent physical properties of SiC material and the advantages of nanoscale structures, thus attracting significant attention from researchers. Herein, the electron vacuum tunneling emission characteristics of an individual SiC nanowire affected by the piezoresistive effect are investigated using in situ electric measurement in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) chamber. The results demonstrate that the piezoresistive effect caused by the electrostatic force has a significant impact on the electronic transport properties of the nanowire, and the excellent electron emission characteristics can be achieved in the pulse voltage driving mode, including lower turn-on voltage and higher maximum current. Furthermore, a physical model about the piezoresistive effect of SiC nanowire is proposed to explain the transformation of electronic transport under the action of electrostatic force in DC voltage and pulsed voltage driving modes. The findings can provide a way to obtain excellent electron emission characteristics from SiC nanowires.",

TiO 2  opacifier/ fiber/ alumina-based aerogel ternary (TFA) composites with high strength and excellent high-temperature thermal insulation were successfully prepared by sol-gel route, impregnation process and supercritical fluid drying. The microstructure, mechanical and thermal insulation properties of TFA composites were investigated comprehensively. The results show that the mechanical property of TFA composites can be significantly enhanced by mullite fiber felt and the incorporation of SiO 2  binder. The effect of TiO 2  opacifier on the high-temperature thermal conductivity was studied by adjusting the content of TiO 2  from 0 to 15 wt%. The obtained TFA composites exhibit high Youngu0027s modulus of up to 3.58 MPa and low high-temperature thermal conductivities of 0.129 W/m·K at 800 °C and 0.168 W/m·K at 1000 °C, respectively.

PI regulator was introduced to guarantee the steady precision and make up for the shortcomings of fuzzy control so that the system robustness and stability precision were improved. The parameters of PI controller could be regulated by control value when controller was switched. The positional control accuracy was guaranteed through PI controller which was designed in outer loop.

The thin films were prepared with a dip-coating method from both one-step and two-step catalyzed silica sols, and treated in a mixture gas of ammonia and water vapour afterwards. The thin films were characterized by using Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), ellipsometer, Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscope (FTIR), respectively. Experimental results have shown that the two-step catalysis remarkably improves strength of the films, and abrasion-resistance and adhesion of the silica films were further increased after the mixture gas treatment. It is attributed to the cross-linking of silica particles in the sols by randomly branched or/and entangled linear chains and more Si–O–Si bonds formed by the mixture gas treatment.",

        "abstract": "The Wangjiagou Fault set,a set of Holocene active faults,is located at western suburbs of Urumqi City.The faults dislocated the gravel platform of the mid Pleistocene and the third level terrace of the Wangjiagou east bank,generating apparent fault scarps of opposite-slope direction on the surface with clear geomorphic traces.There are a series of deformation indications on landform,such as seismic fault,scarp and upheaval.In the field,thirty-nine groups of data were measured by using line tape along the fault.Among them,six were measured on the third level terrace of the Wangjiagou,and the others on the mid Pleistocene platform.Based on the data measured across the fault,we obtain that the height of the scarps is 0.4～1.6m and the width of the fault deformation is about 50m on the third level terrace.And on the mid Pleistocene platform,the height of scarps is 1.5～5.0m and the width of the deformation is about 90m.After comparing the profile of strong topographic deformation zone with the trench section,we primarily recognize that the ratio of hanging wall to foot wall deformation width is 2: 1approximately.The widths of strong surface deformation belt on the mid Pleistocene platform and the third level terrace on the two walls are 60m,30m and 33m,17m,respectively.",

Plastic theories of continuum mechanics are applied to extend the constitutive equations of one dimensional of the compression and torsion tests to that of multi-dimensional respectively. The results show that the material exhibits Mises hardening characteristic. The plastic constitutive equations of the material under complex stress state can be derived by using the data of simple compression test or torsion test.

AGIMA is one distributed computing centered NM prototype system based on intelligent agent (IA) group. The modal logic, which was applied by early scholars when analyzing multi-agent knowledge system, has many drawbacks, while this paper exploits high-level Petri net graph for modeling AGIMA. After giving net graphs of agent and agent group, authors present their mappings to asynchronous and concurrent behavior and show their capacities of analysis and verification of properties within distributed knowledge base. Easy migration to object and layered model also brings net graph auxiliary functions to system implementation",

        "abstract": "The effects of melt flow driven by a travelling magnetic field (TMF) on solidification structures of Sn-1.8 wt.% Cd peritectic alloy have been investigated numerically and experimentally. Numerical results indicate that the flow velocity at the solid-liquid interface under a downward TMF is smaller than that under an upward TMF. The experimental results show that the growth directions of dendrites are chaotic, and several crotches among the dendrites are observed at the solid-liquid interface in the case of no field. It is concluded from TMF results that the ordered growth of dendrites at two different directions occurs, and only one crotch among the dendrites appears at the solid-liquid interface. The location of the crotch gradually approaches the interface center with increasing magnetic field intensity (B≤10.3 mT). Moreover, the growth of high-order branches occurs at the crotch under a downward TMF. A simple model is established for explanation and it well corresponds to the experimental results. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

        "abstract": "P2P (Peer-to-Peer) based service computing has emerged as an important new field in the distributed computing arena. It focuses\n on intensive service sharing, innovative applications and compositions, and in some cases, high performance orientation. However,\n the main challenge for P2P-based service composition process is how to intelligently mining and selection the most appropriate\n peers to execute the service application in complex and dynamic situations. Traditional methodologies are still very inadequate\n to effectively and autonomously conduct the service mining and selection in a real-time environment, as they seldom consider\n and focus on dealing with complex situations, such as simultaneously considering peers’ multiple specifications which reflect\n different properties of e-services. Different ontology based e-service profiles have been proposed to enhance service oriented\n framework for the total or partial automation of service mining, selection and composition, which are involved in either centralised\n or decentralised deployment of services. In this chapter, we propose a modelling based approach to design and develop a P2P\n based service coordination system and their components. The peer profiles are described with the WSMO (Web Service Modelling\n Ontology) standard, mainly for quality of service and geographic features of the e-services, which would be invoked by various\n peers. To fully explore the usability of service categorisation and mining, we implemented an ontology driven unified algorithm\n to select the most appropriate peers. The UOW-SWS prototype also shows that the enhanced peer coordination is more adaptive\n and effective in dynamic business processes.\n ",

A tower-shaped entropy change of the height of ∼27 Jkg K is obtained based on the analyses of heat capacity, while the Maxwell relation predicts an extra entropy peak of the height of ∼99 Jkg K, slightly varying with Pr content. A careful study indicates that the Maxwell relation cannot be used in the vicinity of the Curie temperature because of the coexistence of paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases, and the huge entropy peak is a spurious result. Similar conclusions are applicable to MnAs and Mn1-x Fex As, for which huge entropy changes have been reported.

        "abstract": "Cloud computing is proved to be an effective computing technology for organisations through the advantages that it offers such as cost-effectiveness, IT technical agility and scalability, enhancing businesses processes, and increasing enterprises competitiveness. In Australia, there is an emerging trend that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) begin to adopt this technology in the conventional working practices. However, there is a dearth of prior studies on examining the factors that influence the cloud computing adoption among Australian SMEs. To fill the empirical vacuum, this research-in-progress proposes an integrated framework for examining the determinants of cloud computing service adoption with the consideration of the unique characteristics of Australian SMEs, such as relatively low adoption of cloud computing services, less innovative, and limited knowledge about cloud computing and its benefits and hindrances. To this end, we are conducting consecutive studies to investigate this research issue. An exploratory interview study will be undertaken to identify and verify the unique characteristics of Australian SMEs toward the cloud computing adoption. This is followed by an organisational level survey that examines the effects of those determinants on cloud computing adoption. Finally, a decision model for cloud computing adoption among Australian SMEs will be developed by using a Multi Criteria Decision Approach (MCDA) through rating, prioritising, and ranking of various criteria and alternatives available to the decision makers. Adopting the mixed-method research fashion, this research-in-progress intends to make significant implications to scholars and practitioners alike in the cloud computing research and applications areas.",

        "title": "Glass-forming ability and thermal stability of a new bulk metallic glass in the quaternary Zr–Cu–Ni–Al system",
        "abstract": "A new quaternary Zr-based bulk metallic glass, Zr 51 Cu 20.7 Ni 12 Al 16.3 , was developed by using a newly proposed approach. It has shown that the reduced glass transition temperature, defined as the ratio of the glass transition temperature to the melting point temperature, of the new quaternary Zr-based bulk metallic glass is as high as 0.66. The Gibbs free energy difference between the glassy state and the corresponding equilibrium crystals is estimated to be 0.99 kJ/mol. The maximum diameter of the glassy rod-like sample prepared through conventional copper-mold casting is close to 5 mm. The single amorphous phase remains unchanged after holding at 400 °C for 60 min. These suggest this new alloy having a reasonable glass-forming ability and a high thermal stability against crystallization, promising a base composition for creating other Zr-based bulk glass formers. IDT B176 G183 M190 T154 PACS 61.43.Dq 61.82.Bg 64.70.Pf 68.60.Dv 1 Introduction The last 10 years have witnessed the discovery of multi-component bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) mainly in Zr- [1–3] , Pd- [4,5] , Mg- [6–10] , Ti- [11–13] , Ni- [14–16] , Fe- [17–23] , Cu- [24–26] , La- [27] , and Y- [28] based systems. The new BMGs can be readily manufactured by using conventional casting techniques at a cooling rate as low as 1–100 K/s. These BMGs have demonstrated various superior characteristics and properties over conventional amorphous metals, promising a variety of applications in engineering as a class of novel structural and functional materials. As such, considerable efforts have been devoted to searching novel BMGs with high glass-forming ability (GFA) and high thermal stability. Due to the complexity in the dominant factors governing the formation of multi-component BMGs, however, it is rather difficult to expect a theory which can be used to guide the searching of good glass formers in metallic systems. As a pioneering work, Inoue [29] has proposed the three empirical rules for searching new BMGs: (a) requirement of three or more elements; (b) a difference in atomic size ratios above 12% among the main constituent elements; and (c) negative heats of mixing among the main constituent elements. Although those three empirical rules have been widely used to interpret the GFA in many BMG systems, the method of trail-and-error through extensive experimental searching and screening is still dominating the development of new BMG systems. Recently, Xing [30] proposed a simple and effective approach for efficiently locating the basic compositions of BMGs. The new approach for predicting new BMG compositions is based on the concept that the formation of glassy metals requires suppression of nucleation and growth of the competing crystalline phases. If the chemical affinity between the atomic pairs of the constitutional elements can be balanced to a certain degree, the molten metallic liquid would have a strong ability to prevent the precipitation of any compounds from the melt during the cooling process. It is assumed that such balance in the chemical affinity can be achieved by proportionally mixing the corresponding binary eutectic compositions with low eutectic points, leading to a base composition of a new BMG. By using this approach, we obtained a new Zr-based BMG alloy in the quaternary Zr–Cu–Ni–Al system, i.e., Zr 51 Cu 20.7 Ni 12 Al 16.3 (hereafter referred as alloy Zr51, all compositions are in atomic percentage), which is deduced based on the mixing of binary eutectics Zr 38 Cu 62 , Zr 64 Ni 36 and Zr 51 Al 49 with the ratio of 1/3(Zr 38 Cu 62 ) + 1/3(Zr 64 Ni 36 ) + 1/3(Zr 51 Al 49 ). In this article, we study the glass-forming ability and the thermal stability of alloy Zr51. In order to evaluate the alloy Zr51, the well-known Zr 65 Cu 17.5 Ni 10 Al 7.5 BMG alloy [1,29] (referred as alloy Zr65) was manufactured for comparison. 2 Experimental methods Alloy button ingots having target compositions were prepared by non-consumable arc melting under a Ti-gettered argon atmosphere. Each starting element has a purity of better than 99.9%. For each ingot the melting was repeated for four times to ensure composition homogeneity. Glassy alloys of cylindrical rods forms were prepared by remelting the button ingots and drop casting the melts into a copper-mould cavity. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was conducted under flowing argon using TA 2920 and Netzsch STA 409C/CD DSC instruments to measure the thermal parameters of studied alloys. Annealing was also performed in the DSC cells to examine the thermal stability of the glassy alloys. The amorphous nature of the as-cast samples was monitored by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis using Cu radiation. Microstructures for both as-cast and annealed alloys were investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). To prevent potential annealing during TEM specimen preparation, the TEM specimens in this study were prepared by grinding the slices, taken from the alloy ingots, on a 9 μm diamond lapping films in ethyl alcohol to produce fine powders. The powders were then spread out on holy carbon films supported by copper grids. TEM investigation was carried out in a Tecnai F20 electron microscope operating at 200 kV. 3 Results Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-cast Zr51 alloy with different sample size. Fig. 1 (a) shows that the as-cast sample with a diameter of 3 mm is mostly amorphous, evidenced by the broad diffusion halo dominating its XRD pattern. However, for the as-cast alloy Zr51 sample of 5 mm in diameter, Fig. 1 (b) exhibits several peaks superimposed on the diffusion halo, indicating that this sample contains a certain amount of crystalline phases. This means that, under our experimental condition, we have achieved to produce glassy sample of the Zr51 alloy with a diameter of close to 5 mm. This achievement suggests this newly developed quaternary Zr-based BMG alloy has a reasonable glass-forming ability. Fig. 2 shows the DSC thermograms of the alloys Zr51 and Zr65 in the as-cast and annealed states. Table 1 summarizes the characteristic thermal parameters, deduced from the DSC data, namely, the onset glass transition temperature T g , the onset glass crystallization temperature T x , the onset melting point T m , the supercooled liquid region Δ T x (= T x − T g ), the reduced glass transition temperature T rg (= T g / T m ), the crystallization enthalpies Δ H c1 and Δ H c2 , defined as the integrated area of the crystallization peak, respectively for the samples before and after annealing, and the crystallized fraction due to the annealing [=(Δ H c1 − Δ H c2 )/Δ H c1 ]. As can be seen from Fig. 2 (a) that, both alloys show a distinct glass transition and a significant supercooled liquid region, illustrating characteristics of BMG alloys with high GFA and high thermal stability against crystallization. It is noted that the alloy Zr51 shows a much higher T g , T x and T rg , compared to those of alloy Zr65. The T rg of alloy Zr51 is even high up to those of the quinary Vitreloy series of BMGs [31] , the best Zr-based metallic glass formers reported so far. It is worthwhile to emphasize that the alloy Zr51 has the highest glass transition temperature T g , amongst all reported Zr-based BMGs (see Table 2 in Ref. [31] ). From these results, one can conclude that T rg cannot be used as a criterion for measuring the GFA of the alloy Zr51. Furthermore, both the melting and solidification DSC curves of alloy Zr51 show only a single endothermic peak upon melting and a single exothermic peak upon cooling from the melt [see Fig. 2 (b)]. This implies a concurrent melting and formation of the equilibrium compounds in the heating and cooling cycle, respectively. For this reason, the composition of this alloy is close to the eutectic. In contrast, two or three distinctly separated endothermic and exothermic peaks appear in the heating and cooling DSC curves of the alloy Zr65 [see Fig. 2 (c)], indicating a melting and solidification behavior of an off-eutectic alloy. It is well known that glass formation favors for the alloys with or near eutectic compositions [20] . After annealing at 400 °C for 60 min, the alloys Zr51 and Zr65 also show a similar DSC curve to their corresponding as-cast alloy. The alloy Zr65, however, has already experienced noticeable crystallization, whilst the alloy Zr51 remains a primary amorphous state with no indication of crystallization (see Table 1 ). This reflects the alloy Zr51 having higher thermal stability than the alloy Zr65, although the latter has a much wider supercooled liquid region. It is known that undercooled melts can be frozen to be glassy as long as the formation of the competing crystalline phases can be suppressed. Thermodynamically, the tendency for the glass formation is favorable if the Gibbs free energy difference between the undercooled melts and the corresponding crystalline solids (i.e., Δ G l→s ) is small. In this case, the critical nucleation work for the formation of a crystal becomes large and therefore the nucleation rates are greatly reduced. As a consequence, Δ G l→s is a good measurement for GFA – the less the Δ G l→s , the higher is the GFA [32] . Here we can estimate the Δ G l→s for the alloy Zr51 by using the following expression [28] : (1) Δ G l → s = Δ H f ( T m - T ) T m - γ Δ H f T m ( T m - T ) - T ln T m T , where Δ H f is the enthalpy of fusion, T , the temperature of the undercooled melt, and γ , the proportionality coefficient. By taking γ = 0.8 for metallic glass-forming liquids [28] , Δ H f = 5.44 kJ/mol [deduced from Fig. 2 (b)] and T m = 1076.2 K (see Table 1 ), we can obtain the Δ G l→s = 0.99 kJ/mol for alloy Zr51 at T = 0.8 T m . It is evident that the Δ G l→s for alloy Zr51 is significantly lower than that (Δ G l→s = 2.0 kJ/mol, estimated from Fig. 11 in Ref. [32] ) for alloy Zr65. The relatively small Δ G l→s for the alloy Zr51 provides an indication that this alloy essentially possesses a stronger glass-forming ability, compared to that of the alloy Zr65. Fig. 3 presents the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images and their corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the as-cast and annealed alloys. All TEM specimens were taken from the rod samples with a diameter of 3 mm. Fig. 3 (a) shows a homogenous maze HREM contrast and a single halo ring in its corresponding electron diffraction patterns, indicating the nature of completely amorphous phase in the as-cast alloy Zr51. In the case of the as-cast alloy Zr65, although the amorphous contrast still dominates, as evidenced by the HRTEM image shown in Fig. 3 (b), lattice fringes from crystalline clusters with a size of the nanometer scale [as encircled in Fig. 3 (b)] and sharp electron diffraction spots co-existing with the halo ring in the SAED pattern can also observed, indicating that the as-cast alloy Zr65 has experienced a certain degree of crystallization under the identical manufacturing condition with that used for the as-cast alloy Zr51 in the present study. Interestingly, after annealed at 400 °C for 60 min, the alloy Zr51 still remains its amorphous structure as verified in Fig. 3 (c). However, Fig. 3 (d) shows that the annealed alloy Zr65 has gone through a significant crystallization. This comparison confirms the conclusion made from the DSC data that the alloy Zr51 has a higher thermal stability than the alloy Zr65. 4 Discussion The above experimental results support the alloy Zr51 being a true alloy with a larger GFA and higher thermal stability than the alloy Zr65. Their significant difference in GFA cannot be simply explained in the frame of three empirical rules , because they have same components (namely Zr, Al, Ni, Cu). The atomic sizes, the mixing heats between the elements in these two studied alloys should be the same qualitatively. We believed that the reason of the better GFA of the alloy Zr51 is primarily due to the fact that the chemical interaction between the base element (Zr) and the glass-forming elements (Al, Ni, and Cu) has been balanced in the melt prior to solidification, and consequently providing an extent more favorable for glass formation. This study suggests that such a balance in the chemical interaction can be achieved by the appropriate choice of the mixing ratios of the corresponding binary eutectic compositions. The easiness of glass formation for the alloy Zr51 can be explained by that the selection of the mixing ratios and the binary eutectic compositions is more reasonable for suppression of the formation of the competing crystals, when compared with those for the alloy Zr65. This success of developing a new BMG system suggests our new approach for searching new BMGs is an easy and efficient approach to pin-pointing the required composition for a chosen BMG system. Based on the resultant composition, other BMGs with large GFA can be obtained either by appropriately adjusting the contents of the constitutional elements, or by adding alloying elements. As an example, we can significantly improve the GFA of the alloy Zr51 by adding 0.5% yttrium (the resultant alloy is referred as Zr51Y0.5). The modified alloy can be fabricated into a BMG ingot with a diameter of 10 mm, as shown in Fig. 1 (c). The investigation on the GFA of alloy Zr51Y0.5 and the role of yttrium addition is beyond the scope of this study and will be discussed elsewhere. 5 Conclusions A new BMG alloy, Zr 51 Cu 20.7 Ni 12 Al 16.3 , is designed by using a newly developed approach for determining the basic compositions of BMG formers. The GFA and thermal stability of this new alloy have been assessed from the thermodynamic and microstructural points of view. The most striking result from this study is the easy locating of the multi-component alloy compositions with a good GFA using a powerful and perspective method other than following tedious experimental work. It is expected that the resultant basic compositions can be further modified by appropriate adjustment of the constituent elements or alloying additions in the base alloys to achieve compositions which can be easily produced into amorphous materials in bulk forms through conventional metallurgical routes.

        "abstract": "Objective To explore the safety of iodine intake in adults.Method Euthyroid healthy volunteers aged 18 to 24 years(22.54±2.65y)were adopted and divided into 7 groups randomly.Each group was assigned to receive 500,750,1000,1250,1500,and 2000μg iodide oral doses daily for 4 w.Blood and urine samples during morning fast were obtained on weeks 0,2 and 4.We used chemiluminescence immunoassay(CLIA) to measure sTSH,FT4 and immunoradiometric assay(IRMA) to measure TPOAb and TGAb.Urinary iodine was evaluated.The dietary survey was done by recording method to collect food consumption data for 7 d.We also measured the iodine amount in drinking water,food and iodinized salt.Results All the volunteers were in adequate iodine levels.The median urinary iodine was 272.25μg/L,and the dietary iodine intake including iodinized salt was 346.24μg/d.We found all the iodide supplemented groups responded in the same way with a significant rise in urinary iodide excretion and in serum sTSH levels,with a small decline in serum FT4 concentration at normal range.After 2 w the serum sTSH levels in the iodide supplemented groups increased nearly more than double,and nearly two fold after 4 w.The subclinical hypothyroidism appeared at 500～2000 μg/d after 2 w.After 4 w the prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism kept the same level at 500μg/d(15%),and increased at other iodine supplemented groups. The subclinical hypothyroidism prevalence at the 750-2000μg/d doses was at the range of 28.00%～47.37%.No clinical hypothyroidism was observed among the people during iodide administration.Conclusion The dysfunction of thyroid in normal population was mainly subclinical hypothyroidism with an exposure to a high dose iodine intake(500μg～2000μg) in a short time.It can lead to subclinical hypothyroidism in the subjects at 500μg /d doses.In iodine-sufficient area iodine supplemented dose was not appropriate to exceed 500μg/d.We suggested the UL of iodine below 900 μg/d.",

        "abstract": "Photothermal therapy (PTT) is an emerging modality for cancer treatment owing to its localized treatment of tumors and easy combination with other therapeutic approaches. An imaging guided tumor ablation will facilitate the implementation of the treatment to boost efficiency. A type of multifunctional hybrid liposome is synthesized by loading indocyanine green (ICG) into a hybrid liposome based on a mixture of hybrid lipid and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine–diethylene triamine pentacetate acid–gadopentetate dimeglumine (DMPE-DTPA-Gd). The hybrid liposome exhibited high structure stability and narrow size distribution in aqueous media. According to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), hybrid liposome after tail vein injection accumulated effectively in subcutaneous CT-26 tumor of mice. Moreover, photothermal therapy is able to ablate tumor effectively under MR imaging guidance. Thus, the MRI visible PTT agent-loaded theranostic nanoplatform is promising for effective cancer treatment.",

Individual nanowalls have a typical thickness of about 50 nm and very good conductivity with a typical average value of about 1.97 × 104 Ω-1 cm-1, i.e., only an order of magnitude less than the value of bulk Mo. The formation process is characterized in detail, and it is found that Mo nanowalls grow from nanorods through nanotrees. The atomic arrangement, lattice mismatch relationship, and competition growth are all believed to contribute to the growth mechanism. The field emission performance is attractive, typically with a very low fluctuation of about approximately 1.18% at a high current density level of 10 mA/cm2, and a sustainably stable very large current density of approximately 57.5 mA/cm2 was recorded. These indicate that the Mo nanowall is a potential candidate as a cold cathode for application in vacuum electron devices, which demand both a high current and high current density.",

The compounds exhibit a Ce 6Ni2Si3-type hexagonal structure and undergo a second-order magnetic transition. The Curie temperature decreases from ∼ 187 K to 142 K as the content of Dy grows from 0 to 0.8. The maximal magnetic entropy change, for a field change of 0-5 T, varies between ∼ 6.2 and ∼ 7.4 J/kgK, slightly decreasing when Dy is introduced. The substitution of Dy leads to a remarkable increase in refrigeration capacity (RC).

        "abstract": "Based on thermodynamic characteristics of the stable metallic liquid at melting temperature and the supercooled liquid, the present work calculated the mixing enthalpy Δ H mix , the mixing entropy Δ S mix and the Gibbs free energy difference between the supercooled liquid and the resulting crystalline phases Δ G of typical Ti-based amorphous alloys. The results show that for the case of larger Δ S mix , moderate Δ H mix for the stable liquid and smaller Δ G for the supercooled liquid, Ti-based alloys tend to achieve high glass-forming ability (GFA). A new parameter, β , defined as ( T g − T k )/( T l − T g ), has been introduced to evaluate the GFA of Ti-based bulk amorphous alloys (wherein T g , T l , and T k represent the glass transition temperature, the liquidus temperature, and the Kauzmann temperature, respectively). Experimental data imply that the larger the β , the better the GFA for Ti-based amorphous alloys. PACS 61.43.Dq 64.70.pe 61.25.Mv 65.20.−w Keywords Amorphous metals Metallic glasses Alloys Thermodynamics 1 Introduction Compared to conventional crystalline metallic materials, bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) possess excellent physical, chemical and mechanical properties due to their long-range disordered atomic arrangements [1] . Among them, Ti-based bulk metallic glasses offer a combination of low density, high specific strength and relative low cost as well as other advantages of BMGs [2–4] . As a new engineering material with superior properties and great potential, Ti-based BMGs have stimulated extensive enthusiasm for metallic glass research [5–9] . However, Ti-based BMGs with critical diameters in the centimeter scale obtained so far usually contain toxic elements (such as beryllium) or noble metal (such as palladium), which is either harmful to the environment or incongruous to be manufactured in the industrial scale [10–16] . During the liquid–glass transition process, the GFA is closely related to the thermodynamic characteristics of the metallic liquid. Up to date, numerous theories and experimental data demonstrate that the structures and stabilities of local atomic clusters are important factors controlling the GFA [17,18] . Consequently, better understanding of the thermodynamic characteristics of metallic liquid is of significance to explore new class of Ti-based amorphous alloys with exceptionally high GFA. In this paper, the relationship between the thermodynamic characteristics both of stable and supercooled metallic liquids, and the glass-forming ability of Ti-based amorphous alloys is studied. 2 Experimental procedure The alloy ingots were prepared by arc melting a mixture of pure elements: Ti (99.5%), Cu (99.9%), Zr (99.8%), Ni (99.9%) and Sn (99.9%) in a titanium-gettered argon atmosphere. Then the alloys with nominal compositions Ti 45 Cu 40 Zr 5 Ni 5 Sn 5 , Ti 42.5 Cu 40 Zr 7.5 Ni 5 Sn 5 and Ti 42.5 Cu 40 Zr 10 Ni 5 Sn 2.5 (at.%) were injected into copper mold to obtain cylindrical samples with diameters of 2 mm, 3 mm and 4 mm, respectively. The ribbon samples with 40 μm in thickness were prepared by remelting the alloy ingot in quartz tubes and ejecting through a nozzle onto a copper wheel rotating at a velocity of 40 ms −1 in a purified argon atmosphere. All the samples were examined by X-ray diffraction technique (D/Max-RA X-ray diffractometer, operating at 40 kV and 60 mA) with Cu K α radiation to confirm the amorphous nature. To determine the glass transition temperature T g , melting enthalpy Δ H m , solidus temperature T m , and liquidus temperature T l , thermal analysis was performed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) at a heating rate 40 K min −1 . The machines were calibrated with pure Au and Al standard samples with temperature accuracy less than 2 K. 3 Results Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-cast rods. The diffraction patterns consist of broad diffraction halos, typical of glassy nature. Fig. 2 (a) shows the DSC curves of as-cast 2 and 3 mm samples. Fig. 2 (b) shows the DTA curves both of ribbon and as-cast 4 mm samples. All the samples exhibit a distinct glass transition followed by a two-step exothermic event of the crystallization. During the transition from the pure elements to metallic liquid at melting temperature, there are two important thermodynamically governing factors: the mixing enthalpy Δ H mix and the mixing entropy Δ S mix . Since the contributions from elastic enthalpy and topological enthalpy are much smaller as compared with that from the chemical enthalpy of stable liquid [6] , we neglect the elastic enthalpy and topological enthalpy. For a regular solution, the mixing enthalpy can be written as [19] : (1) Δ H mix = Δ H chem = ∑ i=1,i ≠ j n Ω ij C i C j where Ω ij is the regular solution interaction parameter between i and j elements, which can be expressed by the mixing enthalpy of binary alloys Δ H AB mix ( Ω ij = Δ H AB mix ). C i is the atomic percentage of the i th component. Typically for the amorphous alloys containing one of the non-transition metals (NTMs), Δ H AB mix are used as Δ H AB mix ( cal ) = Δ H AB mix - 1 / 2 Δ H i trans and Δ H AB mix ( cal ) = ( Δ H i trans + Δ H j trans ) / 2 in the case of containing two NTMs. Δ H i trans for NTMs such as H, B, C, N, Si, P, and Ge are 100, 30, 180, 310, 17, 34, and 25 kJ/mol, respectively. Therefore, the mixing enthalpy of stable metallic liquid can be given by: (2) Δ H mix = 4 ∑ i=1,i ≠ j n Δ H AB mix C i C j For multi-component system, taking into account the effect of atomic size mismatch, the mixing entropy of regular liquids can be represented by the following expression [20] : (3) Δ S mix = - R ∑ i = 1 n C i ln φ i where R is the gas constant, φ i is the atomic volume fraction of the i th component and can be written as: (4) φ i = C i r i 3 ∑ i = 1 n C i r i 3 where r i is the atomic radius. Using the data of Refs. [4,7,8,10–15] and experimental data of the present work, the mixing enthalpy and the mixing entropy of typical Ti-based amorphous alloy-forming liquids are calculated by Eqs. (2)–(4) and listed in Table 1 . Fig. 3 shows the correlation between the GFA (represented by the critical size, D max ) and the calculated mixing enthalpy and mixing entropy. The results show that on the condition of larger Δ S mix , moderate Δ H mix for the stable liquid, the Ti-based amorphous alloys tend to have a high glass-forming ability. The Gibbs free energy difference (Δ G ) between a supercooled liquid and crystalline phases can be expressed as: Δ G = Δ H − T Δ S , where Δ H = Δ H m − ∫ T T m Δ C p dT , Δ S = Δ S m − ∫ T T m Δ C p dT T , where T m is the melting temperature, Δ C p is heat capacity difference between the liquid and the crystalline phase, Δ H m is the enthalpy of fusion, and Δ S m is the entropy of fusion. Δ H m and Δ S m are related to each other by Δ S m = Δ H m / T m . On the basis of the above equations, the Δ G can be written as: (5) Δ G = Δ H m T m - T T m - ∫ T T m Δ C p dT + T ∫ T T m Δ C p T dT From Eq. (5) , if the Δ C p could be obtained, the Δ G could also be calculated spontaneously. However, as a metastable supercooled metallic liquid, it is very difficult to obtain the heat capacity of liquid ( C p l ) by laboratorial method. Therefore, many researchers [21–23] have tried to derive analytical expressions of Δ C p in order to calculate Δ G in different materials. Ji and Pan [24] consider the hyperbolic variation of Δ C p with temperature and derive the following expression: (6) Δ G = 2 Δ H m Δ T T m T T m + T - Δ T 2 T m 3 ( T m + T ) 3 Based on the experimental data of the supercooled liquid, calculation of Δ G using Eq. (6) creates smaller deviations and the deviations are more stable at different T rg of amorphous alloys compared with other Δ G expressions. Therefore, in this work, Δ G of typical Ti-based amorphous alloys is calculated by Eq. (6) . The Δ G curves of Ti 45 Cu 40 Zr 5 Ni 5 Sn 5 , Ti 42.5 Cu 40 Zr 7.5 Ni 5 Sn 5, Ti 42.5 Cu 40 Zr 10 Ni 5 Sn 2.5 and Zr 41.2 Ti 13.8 Cu 12.5 Ni 10 Be 22.5 BMGs are shown in Fig. 4 . According to Kauzmann [25] , the existent temperature terminal of supercooled liquid is the Kauzmann temperature ( T k ), at which the entropy difference between the supercooled liquid and the crystalline phase (Δ S ) vanishes. Similarly, as Δ S = 0 at T k temperature, Δ C p = α Δ H m / T m is obtained, where α = [ln( T m / T k )] −1 . The corresponding expression of Δ G is also derived as Eq. (7) [24] . And the temperature T k of different materials can be obtained using fitting of Eq. (6) from the following equation: (7) Δ G = Δ H m Δ T T m ( 1 - α ) T m + ( 1 + α ) T T m + T The enthalpies of fusion of the Ti 45 Cu 40 Zr 5 Ni 5 Sn 5 , Ti 42.5 Cu 40 Zr 7.5 Ni 5 Sn 5 and Ti 42.5 Cu 40 Zr 10 Ni 5 Sn 2.5 BMGs are 13.88 kJ/mol, 13.63 kJ/mol and 12.78 kJ/mol, respectively, measured by DTA. The calculated Δ G curve and the fitted Δ G curve of Ti 42.5 Cu 40 Zr 10 Ni 5 Sn 2.5 are shown in Fig. 5 . The thermodynamic data of typical Ti-based amorphous alloys are shown in Table 2 , and the enthalpies of fusion for fitting are calculated by the method of Ref. [26] . The fitted T k temperatures of typical Ti-based amorphous alloys are also shown in Table 2 . 4 Discussion 4.1 The thermodynamic characteristics of the stable metallic liquid As the initial state of glass-forming process, the thermodynamic characteristics of the stable metallic liquid at the equilibrium state are closely related to the GFA. The mixing enthalpy Δ H mix macroscopically characterizes the chemical bonding force of the constituent elements in the stable liquid. Large negative mixing enthalpy means strong chemical interaction of the constituent elements. Meanwhile, the mixing entropy Δ S mix reflects atomic topological structure in the melting liquid. Large mixing entropy implies more disordered atomic structures. Excessively large Δ H mix deteriorates the GFA of glass-forming alloys. Because although a large Δ H mix reflects strong chemical interaction of the constituent elements resulting in more probability of local atomic clusters and more difficulty of long-distance atom diffusion, if the energy fluctuation in the liquid is sufficient to nucleate, the clusters may evolve into the crystal nucleus. On the other hand, for less chemical bonding force, small Δ H mix leads to the decrease in the probability for the formation of the local atomic clusters. But some new nucleus of crystal may form in this condition by atom diffusion, which contributes to form crystal. Thus, only when the Δ H mix is moderate, it is advantageous of high GFA. When the Δ S mix is large, the distribution of atoms in the stable metallic liquid is exceedingly disordered and the diffusion of atoms is more difficult, correspondingly, it takes more time for the liquid to form a new ordered structure, resulting in a superior GFA. 4.2 The thermodynamic characteristics of the supercooled metallic liquid From the thermodynamic point of view, the GFA for glass-forming liquids should include two aspects: the thermodynamic characteristics of the stable metallic liquid and the stability of the supercooled metallic liquid. The liquid-glass transition is a competing process between the formation of a glassy phase and crystalline phases. The Δ G is the driving force of crystallization and is a vital factor in nucleation rate and crystal growth rate [27] . Generally speaking, the less Δ G means the less driving force of crystallization, the smaller nucleation rate in supercooled liquid and the better GFA. For glass formation, higher stability of the supercooled liquid means less probability of crystallization and better GFA. However, if the supercooled metallic liquid could keep stable under the glass transition temperature ( T g ) due to the favourable characteristics of liquid or external conditions, the GFA will be reduced. Therefore, the existent temperature terminal of supercooled liquid ( T k ), which may be specified as a nature of material, should be considered to evaluate GFA. As we know, the entropy is the characterization of microscopic quantum states, so the entropy of a liquid is larger than that of a crystal. During a cooling process, the entropy difference between the liquid and the crystals become smaller and it vanishes at T k . This process entails no conflict with the second law of thermodynamics [17] , as the system can reduce its Gibbs free energy by freezing. But from topological point of view, the more numbers of quantum states with the same energy means the larger entropy value. Therefore, the entropy difference between the supercooled liquid and the crystal would not become negative (entropy crisis) because, compared with long-range ordered structure of crystals, the supercooled liquid with long-range disordered structure has more numbers of quantum states. Moreover, the Kauzmann temperature ( T k ) can be regarded as “the existent temperature terminal of supercooled liquid” [25]. If the supercooled liquid could keep stable even at T k temperature, in order to avoid the entropy crisis, the supercooled liquid has to form an “ideal glass” of unique configuration, namely, the T k temperature is a thermodynamically controlled temperature of the glass transition from a thermodynamic view. Particularly, the liquidus temperature T l is a reflection of the existent temperature terminal of stable liquid while the Kauzmann temperature T k is a reflection of the existent temperature terminal of supercooled liquid. The GFA of Ti-based amorphous alloys is related to two factors, viz. ( T g − T k ) and ( T l − T g ) and therefore, a parameter β defined as ( T g − T k )/( T l − T g ) is proposed to evaluate the GFA of Ti-based amorphous alloys, as shown in Table 2 . Fig. 6 shows the linear relationship between the D max of some Ti-based BMGs and their corresponding β values. It can be clearly seen that the D max value increases with the increase of β , reflecting that the larger the β , the better the GFA of Ti-based amorphous alloys. The less difference between the T l and T g means the less difference between the existent temperature terminal of stable liquid and the glass transition temperature, the less supercooled degree of glass transition and the less driving force of crystallization. According to classical nucleation and growth theory [28] , the less difference between the T l and T g will result in the lower nucleation rate and growth rate of the crystalline phases, which causes the increasing of GFA. If the difference between T g and T k is large, the supercooled liquid could spontaneously transform to the amorphous phase at a relative high temperature far from the thermodynamically controlled temperature of the glass transition. So the large difference between T g and T k is favourable for glass formation. Also, the potential energy landscape (PEL) theory of glass transition figures that the difference between T g and T k of strong liquid with high GFA is larger than that of fragile liquid [29] . Therefore, parameter β could be a new approach to reflect the GFA of Ti-based amorphous alloys. 5 Conclusions The relationship between the thermodynamic characteristics and the glass forming ability for Ti 45 Cu 40 Zr 5 Ni 5 Sn 5 , Ti 42.5 Cu 40 Zr 7.5 Ni 5 Sn 5, Ti 42.5 Cu 40 Zr 10 Ni 5 Sn 2.5 (at.%) and other previously explored Ti-based amorphous alloys are studied. It can be concluded that larger Δ S mix and moderate Δ H mix for a stable metallic liquid is beneficial for a high GFA. Also, the calculated data indicate that the better the GFA of Ti-based amorphous alloys, the less the Gibbs free energy difference Δ G between the supercooled liquid and the crystalline phase. A thermodynamic parameter β , defined as ( T g − T k )/( T l − T g ), is proposed to evaluate the GFA of Ti-based amorphous alloys.

These W(18)O(49) nanowire arrays have an average diameter of about 30 nm, and their lengths range from 2-3 μm. In every pattern of a 2 inch sample, the nanowires exhibit the same morphology and growth density. They are single crystals with monoclinic structure and grow along the [010] direction. Field emission (FE) measurements show that they have a turn-on field of 6.2 V μm(-1) and their emission current density can reach 500 μA cm(-2) at an electric field of 10.9 V μm(-1). Because the W(18)O(49) nanowire patterns synthesized by this simple method still have good FE performance, comparable to many cathode nanostructures with excellent FE properties, it suggests that it may provide an effective and simple preparation technique for patterned growth of nanowire arrays in future FE applications.",

This phase transition was successfully prevented by the addition of silica and the gas sensing cycles of WO 3/SiO 2 film have been undertaken more than 500 times without any obvious property attenuation. The first principles calculations suggest a tendency of WO 3 from clusters into cross-link network.

        "abstract": "Hydrophobic organic-inorganic silica hybrid films were prepared by means of a two-step acid-catalyzed method and sol-gel process using surfactant as template. Methyltriethoxysilane(MTES) and tetraethoxysilane(TEOS) were co-hydrolyzed in different molar ration and were used as precursors. Addition MTES in TEOS precursors produces a decrease of Si-OH and Si-O - surface content. The infrared spectra of the films thus obtained indicated that they become hydrophobic with the introduction of the methyl groups. Contact angle instrument was also used to supplement the result. Contact angle values for hydrophobic hybrid films are greater than 120 degree. The refractive indices and thickness of hydrophobic hybrid films are about 1.22-1.24 and about 270-300nm The Optical transmittance spectra and mechanical intensity measurement results showed that the films have good optical and mechanical properties.",

The dynamic surface control(DSC) technique was used to lessen the designing complexity. It was proved by using Lyapunov stability analysis that the designed closed-loop adaptive system is hemi-global asymptotic stable. Simulation results show that the controller designed in this paper has apparent adaptability and favorable robustness when there exist external disturbance and unknown non-linearity. The steady precision of controller satisfies the application of multi-position initial alignment in SINS.",

The concentration of methanol in the fuel circulation loop of a DMFC system is an important operating parameter, because it determines the electrical performance and efficiency of the system. The methanol concentration in the circulating fuel stream is usually measured continuously with a suitable sensor for the purpose of maintaining optimal power and efficiency in the DMFC system. Various methods of sensing methanol concentration have been proposed over the past decade. This paper reviews these methanol concentration sensors for DMFCs, which are generally classified into two groups: electrochemical and physical. The construction and operating principles of each sensor, as well as its advantages and disadvantages, are described. The sensorless methods for controlling the methanol concentration are introduced briefly. Finally, the perspective on the future of methanol concentration sensors is discussed.",

With respect to the InN core/In2O3 shell composite material, the preferred crystal orientation of InN is maintained during the oxidation process. Further oxidation of the composite materials results in the formation of In 2O3 nanowires or nanobelts which exhibit geometrical shape and size similar to those of the original InN counterparts. The present work indicates that thermal oxidation of III nitrides promises an easy and controllable approach to fabricating special structures such as composite, even complex architecture via conformal conversion. © IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "The microstructure and room temperature fracture toughness of pseudo-binary NiAl-Mo (x= 7.8, 9, 13 and 16 at. %) in situ composites were investigated. For all four alloys examined, uniform and well-aligned Mo fibrous structures were directionally solidified by the liquid metal cooling process at the growth rate of V = 6 μm/s, respectively. With the increase of the Mo content, the spacing of the Mo fibers decreased and the volume fraction of Mo fibers increased. Significant influence of Mo addition on the toughness was observed for the directional solidification alloys, and the fracture toughness was found to increase with volume fraction of Mo rods. Scanning electron microscopy was used to characterize the fracture behavior. Based on the results of theoretical analysis, the composite structures of these alloys provided improvement in fracture toughness over binary NiAl primarily by crack trapping and crack bridging. Interface debonding, crack deflection and microcrack linkage provided further resistance to crack growth. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Silica aerogel powders (SAp) are the scrap materials derived from the industrial production and use of silica-aerogel products and become the challenges to be disposed. In this paper, SAp play a role as the shrinkage inhibiter to fabricate the SAp “jammed” polyimide gels. Herein, the “jammed” effect means that the polyimide backbones have been “stretched up” by the micron-scale SAp. Namely, the strong chains-packing effect, which is always taking placing during the gelation process and results in a high shrinkage of the polyimide backbones, has been effectively prevented by a simple physical mixture of SAp. This “jammed” effect greatly reduces the shrinkage as low as 7.5%. Meanwhile, SAp are treated as the pore formers to make a conversion to polyimide aerogel with ultra-low density of about 0.02 g cm−3. In addition, incorporation of SAp also dramatically enhances the hydrophobicity (water contact angle up to 152°). Overall, SAp “jammed” polyimide aerogels have low thermal conductivity (0.028–0.031 W m−1 K−1), high mechanical strength, and high thermal stability. This combination of properties makes them more applicable as thermal insulators in harsh environments. Certainly, recycling of the scraped SAp by simple physical mixture with organic PI is also an advocated way for energy conservation.",

        "abstract": "Sol-Gel optical film was widely used in high power laser system with the development of its preparation technique. Ultraviolet treating is an effective method to solidify the film and improve its performance. In this paper, optical films were deposited on K9, silica glass and silicon wafer substrates by Sol-Gel spin-coating method and ultraviolet light source was produced by 1000W high-pressure mercury lamp to irradiate these optical films. SEM, AFM, IR and ellipsometer were used to characterize the structure and optical properties of the films. Mechanical property of films was measured by pencil hardness-testing device. Laser damage threshold of films was measured by a Q-switched Nd:YAG high power laser whose wavelength was 1064nm and its pulse width 15ns. The results show that UV-irradiation can improve the mechanical property and increase the refractive index of the films. The nodules on the film surface can be changed into pits by UV-irradiation process so the laser damage threshold of Sol-Gel thin films increased. The laser damage threshold of ZrO 2 single-layer film added with PVP reaches 50.6J/cm 2 (1064nm, 1ns) after UV-irradiation process. It was found that UV-irradiation is an effective method to avoid infiltrating between the layers and improve the homogeneity of the multilayer films. The reflection of 5 layers of ZrO 2/SiO 2 multi-layer films is increased more than 10% after UV-irradiation treatment.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To observe the distribution of the marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) labeled with Feridex in the liver and spleen after transplantation via common carotid artery with MR imaging. Methods: MSCs of SD rats were labeled with Feridex using Protamine as transfection agent. The feasibility and safety of MSCs labeling were assessed. Thirty rats with global cerebral ischemia were randomly selected to be transplanted with 5 × 10 6 labeled MSCs (labeled group) or unlabled MSCs (unlabeled group) via common carotid artery equally. After transplantation serial MR imaging of the liver and spleen were performed to measure signal intensity ratio of liver and spleen to muscle. The liver and spleen tissues were sampled for Prussian blue staining. Results: The labeling efficiency of MSCs with Feridex was about 100%. There was no statistical difference of Trypan blue exclusion rate and the optical absorption value in the MTT proliferation test between labeled cells and unlabeled cells within 7 d (F=0.27-2.06, P>0.05; F=0.025-0.322, P>0.05). Signal intensity on FFE T1WI of the liver and spleen of labeled group decreased. No statistical difference of liver signal intensity ratio was found between the two groups at 3rd day (F=4.72, P>0.05), nor of spleen signal intensity ratio at 7th day (F=3.89, P> 0.05). The liver and spleen of labeled group had numerous Prussian blue staining positive particles, but gradually decreased as time went by. Conclusion: Labeling MSCs with Feridex and Protamine is efficient and safe. A large quantity of labeled MSCs distribute in the liver and spleen during transplantation via common carotid artery majority.",

The dose-response relationship with tetrachlo-rodibenzo-dioxin (TCDD) was also studied to develop TCDD detection method and the binding degree related to dose response.(1) The target genes including AhR-PAS, AhR-C and ARNT-PAS were amplified by RT-PCR by using the total RNA purified from the liver cells of C57BL/6J mice as templates to construct pGEX-5X1 recombinants. The recombinant plasmids were expressed in E. coli. (2) The rabbits were immuned by the clonal fusion proteins: AhR-PAS, AhR-C to prepare the polyclonal antibody. (3) The natural AhR from the hepatic cytosol of C57BL/6J mice was extracted. The artificial cloning expressed fusion protein:GST-ARNT-PAS and the natural AhR were incubated in different dose of TCDD. The quantity of the heterodimer through affinity adsorption and Western blots were measured.(1) The target proteins including AhR-PAS, AhR-C and ARNT-PAS were successfully cloned and expressed in E. coli. (2) The detection limit of polyclonal antibody AhR-PAS and AhR-C were 5 ng and 1 ng, respectively. (3) The total protein concentration prepared from the liver cells was 60.5 mg/ml. The artificial clonal protein ARNT-PAS could specifically bind to the natural AhR complex with the existence of TCDD. The detection limit of TCDD was 0.25 pmol which was 80 pg approximately.A TCDD detection method based on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor system was established and the detection limit might reach pg grade.",

        "abstract": "Eco-friendly, highly effective, and low-cost solar steam generation has great potentials in the application of power generation, seawater desalination, and industry wastewater treatment. Solar steam generation requires an evaporator that has strong light absorption over a wide frequency band (200-3000 nm), high photo-thermal conversion efficiency, and good thermal insulation to avoid excessive heat loss. Herein, foam strengthened ultra-black carbon aerogels (CAs) with micropores, mesopores and macropores were prepared using freeze drying. The small-size conductor effect in ultra-black CAs could increase the surface electron concentration, leading to the increase of light absorption, and ultimately enhancing photo-thermal conversion efficiency. Consequently, under 1 sun illumination, dried CA-5 exhibited a fast temperature rise rate and the highest thermal equilibrium temperature of 87.6 ℃ among CAs, the equilibrium temperature is 20.8 ℃ higher than that of the foam. Besides, CA-5 exhibited a high water evaporation rate of 1.29 kg m-2 h-1 under only 1 sun illumination. To further increase the hot-electron effect, CO2 activation was implemented. The highest water evaporation rate among activated CAs (ACAs) was 1.37 kg m-2 h-1, which is about 2.85 times higher than that of pure water. The highest water evaporation efficiency was 87.51%, which is better than most of the previously reported evaporation efficiencies. Besides the hot-electron enhancement effect, ACAs with thermal insulation, mechanical strength, and thermal stability show great potential for producing fresh water from seawater, industrial wastewater, and even concentrated acidic or alkaline solutions.",

Thus the classification of backlight targets, the preparation of target materials and the interaction between targets and high power laser were introduced in this paper. Underdense targets were more competitive than traditional dense targets among the backlight targets. Nano-structured foam targets, which could be classified into nanofiber targets and aerogel targets, were regarded as novel high-efficiency underdense targets. Nanofiber, which was commonly prepared via electrospinning and thermal treatment, exhibited good formability and high concentration of emission atoms; while aerogel, which was prepared via sol-gel processes and supercritical fluid drying, possesses the advantages of homogeneous microstructure and theoretically high conversion efficiency, but accompanied with the disadvantages of complex synthetic processes and low concentration of emission atoms. To prepare monolithic aerogels with low density and high concentration of emission atoms via combined sol-gel theories may be the better design for the development of the laser-induced X-ray backlight.",

Endogenous neurogenesis enhanced via activation of neural stem cells (NSCs) could be a promising method for stroke treatment. In vivo targeted tracking is highly desirable for monitoring the dynamics of endogenous NSCs in stroke. Previously, we have successfully realized in vivo targeted MR imaging of endogenous NSCs in normal adult mice brains by using anti-CD15 antibody-conjugated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (anti-CD15-SPIONs) as the molecular probe. Herein, we explore the performance of this molecular probe in targeted in vivo tracking of activated endogenous NSCs in ischemic stroke. Our study showed that intraventricular injection of anti-CD15-SPIONs could label activated endogenous NSCs in situ seven days after ischemic stroke, which were detected as enlarged areas of hypo-intense signals on MR imaging at 7.0 T. The treatment of cytosine arabinosine could inhibit the activation of endogenous NSCs, which was featured by the disappearance of areas of hypo-intense signals on MR imaging. Using anti-CD15-SPIONs as imaging probes, the dynamic process of activation of endogenous NSCs could be readily monitored by in vivo MR imaging. This targeted imaging strategy would be of great benefit to develop a new therapeutic strategy utilizing endogenous NSCs for ischemic stroke.",

Methods Retrospectively ECG-gated MSCT coronary angiography of 22 patients with previously known arrhythmia or arrhythmia merely occurred during examination or unindentify ECG mechanic error happened during examination were included. The coronary angiography were obtaind respectviely using original synchronously record ECG or using the ECG after edited with the built-in ECG editing software. The image quality of reconstructed coronary arteries was compared before and after the editing of synchronously record ECG. Results Of 22 patients, 14 had previously known arrhythmia including 4 auriculo-ventricular block, 4 atrial fibrilation and 2 occasional premature ventricualr contraction; 7 had arrhythmia occurred during examination including 2 atrial fibrilation and 4 atrial fibrilation and 1 sick sinus syndroms; 1 had unindentified paritally ECG misssing. The arrhythmia and ECG partially missing resulted in blurring, segemental missing, significant stepladder artifacts of reconstructed coronary arteries using original ECG and 53% (172/325) coronanry segements were assessable for diagnosis. After ECG editing, the image quality of coronary segements was obviously improved with an increase of the assessable sgements to 96% (313/325). There was significantly statistical difference between them (χ2=161.4826, P<0.001). Conclusion The ECG editing could be used to markedly improve the image quality of MSCT coronary angiography in the presence of arrhythmia during the examination or unkown mechanic ECG failure.",

Compared with other preparations methods for gasoschromic films, sol-gel process shows several advantages, such as low cost and large-scale applications. However, sol-gel WO3 films were not stable enough for commercial application yet. In this paper, we first investigated the effect of SiO2 doping, which exhibited good enhancement of WO3 gasochromic films' stability. We also examined the relationship between SiO2 ratio and stability of WO3/SiO2 films.

        "abstract": "In present work, a new type of bulk metallic glass quaternary alloy, Zr51Al9.96Ni14.34Cu24.7, was designed by using binary eutectic clusters method. The new alloy displays a high strength up to 2356 MPa and a large plastic strain of 14.6% at room temperature according to compression test. The excellent ductility of the present glassy alloy is attributed to the deformation to induce the nanocrystalline, which can induce the formation of numerous new shear bands and enhance the density of shear bands; on the other hand, to influence the propagation of shear bands to intersect and to branch during deformation process, as a result, the plasticity of alloy is improved. © 2009, Northwest Institute for Nonferrous Metal Research.

        "abstract": "The process of dual-frequency electromagnetic hold shaping has been studied for heat resistant steel parts. A coupling system of dual-inductor, melt and shield screen condition has been first established for the electromagnetic hold shaping in vacuum. It is found that the preheating inductor does not affect the distributions of magnetic flux density and electromagnetic pressure basically under the experiment conditions and with a space of 25mm between the two inductors. At the same time, the preheating inductor can independently regulate the temperature distribution of melt in shaping inductor and increase the overheat degree of melt. The shield screen can regulate the melt temperature distribution and raise the S/L(Solid/Liquid) interface into a proper position within the shaping inductor, which causes the melt in an ideal state with vertical side face and makes the melt shaping by maximal electromagnetic pressure. The effective ratio of heat to force is a necessary condition for the coupling of electromagnetic shaping. The sufficient condition for coupling of electromagnetic shaping is that the S/L (Solid/Liquid) interface producing maximum static pressure should locate at the acting point of maximum electromagnetic pressure. At last, the heat resistant steel plate-form parts with better surface quality and directional structure have been obtained by the dual-frequency electromagnetic hold shaping.",

Subsequent annealing may relax the stress and modify the atom ordering, thus influencing the magnetic properties and martensitic transformation behaviors. Our studies demonstrate that post-annealing at temperatures ≤ 300 °C can lead to a significant change in the magnetic properties and martensitic temperature (TM). Annealing the sample at 300 C for 3 h can cause a decrease of as much as 30 K in TM (from 319 to 289 K) while retaining strong metamagnetic behaviors. The field-induced metamagnetic transition is accompanied with a large magnetocaloric effect. With an increase in the annealing temperature, the magnitude of the effective magnetic entropy change decreases somewhat, while the refrigeration capacity shows a slight increase. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.",

A quantitative description of the false target problem in stereo vision is proposed and applied to binocular and trinocular stereo vision. It is shown that a new trinocular stereo vision strategy matching the feature primitives in 3-D space can effectively solve the false targets. The new method for matching trinocular images is then presented. A new calibration method is also proposed and we show that all linear cameras can be transformed into an equilvalent orthonormal one and both the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of a trinocular stereo vision system can be calibrated without using any 3-D coordinates, which provides a passive measurement system with an auto-calibration capability. A system based on the proposed methods has been realized and tested for computer-generated and real images. The experimental results are satisfactory. Erroneous matching is always less than 1% and the precision for 3-D reconstruction is 2 mm at a distance of about 1.5 m.",

        "abstract": "For classification tasks, such as protein-protein interactions (PPI), support vector machines (SVMs) have been continually utilised as a standard machine learning model. However, most practices in PPIs classifications are limited to common circumstances with small datasets and low feature dimensions, due to the big computation burden of kernel functions and quadratic optimization of SVM. Alternatively, these practical experiences might tend to employ a linear model once the dataset becomes larger, which may have exclusively lost the kernel function's potential. Since there are different defined kernels and various groups of hyperparameter, the time costs in estimating a best set of hyperparameter by traditional grid search are subsequently tremendous for PPI classification. To address this challenge, in this paper, we present a more efficient solution of hyperparameter estimation by gaining acceleration with GPU, which trains SVM efficiently and accurately with kernel functions calculation accelerated on various PPI datasets. The experiments are firstly conducted on PPI classification task, and we have exclusively evaluated the effectiveness on five public classification datasets. Our solution demonstrates a faster and more accurate performance comparing with the state-ofthe-art.",

It is well known that water vapor and volatile organic compounds in both the laser bay and target bay environments will reduce the antireflective efficiency and laser-damage resistance of the sol-gel AR coating. In this study, alkylation with organosilanes in the vapor state was investigated. Sol-gel AR coatings were vapor-phase treated with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) and trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) at room temperature, and the resulting post-treated sol-gel AR coatings were tested for their resistance to contamination by a series of volatile organic compounds. Contact angle measurements were taken to discern the degree of silanization. After the vapor treatment of sol-gel AR coatings with organosilanes, the spectral performance of the coatings were analyzed by spectrophotometer, both before and after the exposure to volatile organic compounds. It is found that the coatings treated with ammonia and HMDS show a better contamination resistant capability. After being contaminated 70 hours with hexane, the transmittance of the coatings presents no obvious decrease. And the vapor treatment produces an increase in their damage threshold at 1064 nm (10ns pulse width) as compared to untreated control samples. © 2011 SPIE.",

        "abstract": "Active control on field emission current has been an important issue for application of field emitter arrays in modern vacuum micro/nano devices. Earlier, MOSFET (VTFT)-structured Si and Mo tip devices have been demonstrated. It was found that the emission current can be active controlled by the built-in MOSFET (/TFT) [1, 2]. Meanwhile, the stability of the emission current was dramatically improved. However, the high-cost micro-fabrication process and the difficulty in large area device fabrication limit its further application. Although there are a large number of reports on field emission properties of one dimensional nanomaterials, few reports are concerned with the active control on their field emission current. One possible reason is that normally high temperature is needed for preparation of nano-materials, which is far beyond the endurance of the active device. In the present work, experiments have been carried out to study locally-grown ZnO nanowires on the drain-electrode of MOSFET by low-temperature solution-phase method and the effect of active control on field electron emission. © 2010 IEEE.",

This deposition process is based on deposition by partially hydrolyzed titanium alkoxide and alkoxysilane during high-temperature supercritical fluid drying. The nanoparticles are significantly reinforced, and the crystal growth of titania upon heat treatment is effectively restricted by supercritical deposition, which leads to the enhanced mechanical strength and heat resistance of titania aerogels. The Young’s modulus of the resulting titania aerogel is enhanced up to 4.2 MPa. The specific surface area of the optimized titania aerogel increases up to 147 m2/g and the corresponding linear shrinkage decreases to as low as 11% after heat treatment at 1000 °C. This may significantly contributed to the high-temperature applications of titania aerogels in thermal insulations, catalysts, catalyst supports, etc.",

The effect of Pr on solidification structures of Sn-Cd alloys is studied by using optical microscope, scanning electron microscope(SEM) and energy spectrum analysis(EDS). For Sn-1.8 wt% Cd hyperperitectic alloy, the amount of the peritectic β phase of Sn-1.8 wt% Cd with 0.5 wt% Pr increases at the rate of 2 μm/s, and the microstructure refines distinctly at the rate of 4 μm/s. For Sn-0.65 wt% Cd hypoperitectic alloy, the addition of Pr promotes the planar → cellular transition at the rate of 4 μm/s. The microstructure refines by degrees with the increasing of Pr content at the rate of 16 μm/s. However, the microstructure changes unsignificantly with the increasing of Pr content at the rate of 100 μm/s. The addition of Pr can change the volume fraction of phase, refine the microstructure and decrease the interface stability.",

When reaction time was 60 min, the highest conversion was obtained at temperatures of 390°C and 410°C for Yangcun coal and Daliuta coal, respectively. The conversion followed the order of both LTCTD > blended heavy oils > PR. There is no intensive synergy between LTCTD and PR on coal conversion. GC-MS analysis showed that PR mainly consisted of long-chain alkane and LTCTD was mainly derivate of naphthalene. Their interactions with coal were discussed.",

The objective of this study is to seek fundamental insight into the oxidation behavior of a Ti2AlNb-based alloy via detailed microstructural characterization of oxide scale and scale/substrate interface after oxidation at 800 °C using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The oxide scale exhibits a complex multi-layered structure consisting of (Al,Nb)-rich mixed oxide layer (I)/mixed oxide layer (II)/oxygen-rich layer (III)/substrate from the outside to inside, where the substrate is mainly composed of B2 and O-Ti2AlNb phases. High-resolution TEM examinations along with high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging reveal: (1) the co-existence of two types (α and δ) of Al2O3 oxides in the outer scale, (2) the presence of metastable oxide products of TiO and Nb2O5, (3) an amorphous region near the scale/substrate interface including the formation of AlNb2, and (4) O-Ti2AlNb phase oxidized to form Nb2O5, TiO2 and Al2O3.",

        "abstract": "A phenomenon of field emission instability is reported. Field emission current oscillation was observed when a single zinc oxide (ZnO) one dimensional nanostructure operated at high current density. As a result, the radius curvature of the nanoemitter apex was sharpened to less than 15 nm. This indicates the oscillation was associated with melting of the emitter material. We found that the oscillation may be ascribed to (i) the behavior of charging and (ii) the shape changing of a metallic liquid ball that exists at the tip apex under high electric field. The net force of electric force and surface tension modifies the radius of the apex periodically, which results in the oscillation of field emission current. This finding may enhance the understanding of the physical process of field emission from ZnO nanostructures. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.",

        "abstract": "The great technological potential for bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) arises primarily because of their superior mechanical properties. To realize this potential, it is essential to overcome the severe ductility limitations of BMGs which are generally attributed to shear localization and strain softening. Despite much international effort, progress in improving the ductility of BMGs has been limited to certain alloys with specific compositions. Here, we report that severe plastic deformation of a quasi-constrained volume, which prevents brittle materials from fracture during the plastic deformation, can be used to induce strain hardening and to reduce shear localization in BMGs, thereby giving a significant enhancement in their ductility. Structural characterizations reveal the increased free volume and nanoscale heterogeneity induced by severe plastic deformation are responsible for the improved ductility. This finding opens a new and important pathway towards enhanced ductility of BMGs. © 2011 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Nerve T2 values were measured, and compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the diagnostic ability of T2 value to identify DPN.Nerve T2 value was 55.06 ± 4.05 ms, 48.91 ± 3.06 ms and 45.61 ± 1.86 ms in patients with DPN, patients without DPN and controls, respectively. Patients with DPN had significantly higher nerve T2 values than patients without DPN (P < 0.001). Nerve T2 values in patients without DPN were higher than in controls (P < 0.001). ROC analysis showed that T2 values had a diagnostic sensitivity of 81.8 %, specificity of 89.2 % and area under the curve of 0.922 for identifying patients with DPN from patients without DPN plus controls when the cutoff point was 51.34 ms.T2 value of the tibial nerve can be used as an alternative, non-invasive quantitative parameter to assess DPN in diabetic patients.• Tibial nerves in patients with DPN showed T2 hyperintensity and enlargement. • Tibial nerves in patients with DPN had an increased T2 value. • T2 value might be used as a quantitative biomarker for DPN.",

The effect of growth rate(v) on the solidified microstructures such as rod spacing(λ), rod size(d) and rod volume fraction was experimentally investigated. Two types of the solidified interfaces, planar and cellular, were identified. On the condition of both planar and cellular eutectic microstructures, the relationships between λ, d and v were given as: λv1/2=5.90 μm·μm1/2·s1/2and dv1/2=2.18 μm·μm1/2·s1/2, respectively. It was observed that the volume fraction of Mo phase could be adjusted in a certain range. The variation of phase volume fraction was attributed to undercooling increase and the growth characteristics of the individual constituent phases during the eutectic growth.",

SiO2 was used as the low-refractive index component and ZrO2 as the high-refractive index material. The colloidal suspension of ZrO2 was prepared by hydrothermal hydrolysis of ZrOCl2. The solvent in colloidal suspension of SiO2 was replaced by methoxyethanol through distillation. A high-pressure mercury lamp was used to do the irradiation treatment. SEM,IR and UV-VIS spectrophotometer were used to characterize the structure and optical properties of the films. Ellipssometry was used to study the thickness and refractive index of the films. The films were irradiated by a Q-switched Nd:YAG high power laser whose wavelength was 1064 nm and its pulse width was 15 ns. The results show that solvent-exchange and UV-irradiation are effective methods to avoid the cracking in the multilayer films and the infiltrating between the layers and improve laser damage threshold of sol-gel films.",

        "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the accuracy of two parameters,fasting urine iodine exection and the daily urine iodine excretion estimated after creatinine correction of the fasting value. Method One hundred and sixty one normal volunteers aged 20-24 years were randomly assigned to receive 500,750,1 000,1 250,1 500,1 750 and 2 000 μg iodine per day for 4 w. Fasting urine was sampled at 0,2,and 4 w respectively. The urine iodine was measured by arsenic-cerium catalytic spectrophotometry and the urine creatinine by method of alkaline picric acid. The volunteers recorded their dietary information for 7 d. The means of fasting urine iodine and the daily urine iodine excretion estimated after creatinine correction in 7 groups were compared by One-way ANOVA. And the regression analysis was used further to explore the relationship between the iodine intake and fasting urine iodine excretion either as whole sample or as daily excretion after ceatinine correction respectively. Results There was no difference of dietary iodine intake among the groups before iodine supplementation,and the average value was 328 μg/d. After iodine supplementation,the fasting urine iodine excretion or the daily urine iodine exretion estimated aftercreatinine correction had good correlation with iodine intake (r=0.958-0.976,P=0.000) . The slope of the latter curve was nearly to 1. Conclusion Both of the fasting urine iodine excretion and the daily urine iodine excretion after creatinine correction are sensitive parameters to evaluate the iodine status. The former would be most likely to assess population’s iodine status because it is liable to fluctuate. The latter might be used both for large sample and for individual investigation as it is invariabe and more approximate to the iodine intake.",

        "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS), as primary intermediates formed during photocatalytic reactions, are critical for a photocatalyst to realize high activity. The major objective of this study was to investigate the regulation of ROS involved in the photocatalytic degradation process via constructing a typical metal-semiconductor hybrid heterojunction using Ag nanoparticles/anatase TiO₂ as an example. Based on radical capturing, electron paramagnetic resonance, and electron spin resonance experiments, an increase in the available ROS can be achieved in the Ag/TiO₂ heterojunction due to the fast separation of photogenerated carriers. In addition, due to the change in the electron transfer pathway, superoxide radicals (·O₂) are the dominant reactive species responsible for dye degradation using Ag/TiO₂ rather than hydroxyl radicals (·OH) as the main free radicals in pristine TiO₂. This study offers fresh insight into the regulation of ROS in photodegradation via the construction of a Ag/TiO₂ heterojunction.",

        "abstract": "The trans-resveratrol (RSV)-loaded silica aerogel (RLSA) was prepared by the sol-gel method, adding the drug during the aging process, solvent replacement and freeze drying. A series of characterizations showed that RSV stays in the silica aerogel in two ways. First, RSV precipitates due to minimal solubility in water during the solvent replacement process. After freeze drying, the solvent evaporates and the RSV recrystallizes. It can be seen from scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images that the recrystallized RSV with micron-sized long rod-shaped is integrated with the dense silica network skeleton. Second, from small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) results, a portion of the RSV molecules is not crystallized and the size is extremely small. This can be attached to the primary and secondary particles of silica to enhance its network structure and inhibit shrinkage, which is why the volume and pore size of RLSA is larger. In addition, the diffusion of RSV in silica alcogel was studied by a one-dimensional model. The apparent diffusion coefficients of inward diffusion, outward diffusion and internal diffusion were calculated by fitting the time- and position-dependent concentration data. It was found that the outward diffusion coefficient (5.25 × 10 m/s) is larger than the inward (2.93 × 10 m/s), which is probably due to the interface effect. The diffusion coefficients obtained for different concentrations in the same process (inward diffusion) are found to be different. This suggests that the apparent diffusion coefficient obtained is affected by molecular adsorption.",

        "abstract": "Amylose is a promising nanocarrier for gene delivery in terms of its good biocompatibility and high transfection efficiency. Small interfering RNA against survivin (survivin-siRNA) can cause tumor apoptosis by silencing a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-specific gene at the messenger RNA level. In this study, we developed a new class of folate-functionalized, superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-loaded cationic amylose nanoparticles to deliver survivin-siRNA to HCC cells. The cellular uptake of nanocomplexes, cytotoxicity, cell apoptosis, and gene suppression mediated by siRNA-complexed nanoparticles were tested. The results demonstrated that folate-functionalized, SPIO-loaded cationic amylose nanoparticles can mediate a specific and safe cellular uptake of survivin-siRNA with high transfection efficiency, resulting in a robust survivin gene downregulation in HCC cells. The biocompatible complex of cationic amylose could be used as an efficient, rapid, and safe gene delivery vector. Upon SPIO loading, it holds a great promise as a theranostic carrier for gene therapy of HCC.",

        "abstract": "The effect of partial substitute of Ti for Ni in bulk metallic glass Zr60Cu20Ni10-x Al10Tix(x= 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) is studied. The results show that the width of the supercooled liquid region Δx is enlarged when a small amount (1%-2%) of Ni is replaced by Ti, but minimized when the replacing amount is over 2%, due to the emergence of exothermic peaks at temperature lower than the previous T x in DSC curves. Meanwhile, the reduced transition temperature T rg increases with increasing amount of Ti from 1% to 5% in the alloys. The relative glass forming ability shown by wedge-shaped samples of different Ti contents reveals the same trend with that of Trg. Therefore, it is implied from the above results that a large ΔT x (or a high thermal stability of supercooled liquid) is not necessarily connected with a high glass forming ability.",

Beaucoup d'operateurs linéaires pour la détection des contours dans images brutées, y compris des filtres optimaux, ont été proposés. Notons que la plupart de ces opérateurs ont été déduits à partir du modèle mono-frontière or il existe toujours nombreux points contours dans les images réelles. Il est donc nécéssaire d'analyser le problème de la détection de multi-contour. Dans cet article, nous présentons d'abords le filtre otimal pour la détection de mono- et multi-contours et nous montrons que un filtre optimal pour enlever du bruit en détection de contours est un filtre exponentiel symmétrique de taille infinie (ISEF). Dans les cas généraux, le filtre optimal est une combinaison linéaire des sorties d'une cascade de ISEF. En utilisant la cascade de ISEF, nous analysons ensuite un certain nombre de filtres à bande limitée pour la détection des contours, tels que les filtres Gaussien, cascade de Gaussiens, technique de ‘box’, transformée rapide des filtres, filtre de Canny, méthode DRF, différence des ‘box’ et filtres de Gabor et nous montrons que tous ces filtres peuvent être déduits et unifiés par ISEF.",

The structure and chemical composition of the coatings annealed at different temperatures were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The refractive indices of the coatings were calculated from the measured transmittance and reflectance spectra. An increase in refractive index with the high temperature thermal annealing process was observed. The Raman and FTIR results indicate that the refractive index variation is due to changes in the removal of the organic component, phase separation and the crystal structure of the binary coatings. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

        "abstract": "Personalized recommendation technology in E-commerce is widespread to solve the problem of product information overload. However, with the further growth of the number of E-commerce users and products, the original recommendation algorithms and systems will face several new challenges: (1) to model user's interests more accurately, (2) to provide more diverse recommendation modes, and (3) to support large-scale expansion. To address these challenges, from the actual demands of E-commerce applications (as Made-in-China website), a personalized hybrid recommendation system, which can support massive data set, is designed and implemented in this paper by using Cloud technology. Hereinto, the recommendation algorithms are designed based on a novel user interesting model for different scenarios, and the massive data parallel processing techniques in Cloud computing is utilized to realize the effective execution of recommendation algorithms. Finally, several experiments are presented to highlight the system performance.",

Samples, pretreated at temperatures /spl les/800/spl deg/C for several hours, and with chemical surface modification by HMDS (hexamethyldisilazane), were subjected to microstructure analysis. Electret properties of these samples, corona charged at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 200/spl deg/C, were studied. Isothermal surface potential decay and thermally stimulated discharge measurements were made. The relationship between the microstructure of these samples and their electret properties was discussed. The electret properties of one of the most important fluoropolymeric electret materials, porous PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene), also were studied. Our results show that porous dielectrics can be good electret materials.",

In vivo monitoring of adult endogenous NSCs would be of great benefit to the understanding of the neurogenesis plasticity under normal and pathological conditions. Here we show the feasibility of in vivo targeted MR imaging of endogenous NSCs in adult mouse brain by intraventricular delivery of monoclonal anti-CD15 antibody conjugated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. After intraventricular administration of these nanoparticles, the subpopulation of NSCs in the anterior subventricular zone and the beginning of the rostral migratory stream could be in situ labeled and were in vivo visualized with 7.0-T MR imaging during a period from 1 day to 7 days after the injection. Histology confirmed that the injected targeted nanoparticles were specifically bound to CD15 positive cells and their surrounding extracellular matrix. Our results suggest that in vivo targeted MR imaging of endogenous neural stem cells in adult rodent brain could be achieved by using anti-CD15-SPIONs as the molecular probe; and this targeting imaging strategy has the advantage of a rapid in vivo monitoring of the subpopulation of endogenous NSCs in adult brains.",

The master structure of the gratings was produced by the holographic optical process of two coherent beams from an argon ion laser source interference. The period of gratings is 1-2 μm and the depth is 70-100 nm. The patterns on the photoresists were transferred to nickel replicas by electroplating process. Finally, the surface reliefed gratings were embossed onto the ZrO2 coated plastic foils using the nickel replicas as stamps. The influences of the period and the depth of the grating, the incident angle and the refractive index of nano-coating to diffraction efficiency were researched. Therefore, this structure provides a feasible approach to detect high-power laser.",

        "abstract": "Titanium oxide coatings have been deposited by the sol-gel dip-coating method. Crystallization of titanium oxide coatings was then achieved through thermal annealing at temperatures above 400 °C. The structural properties and surface morphology of the crystallized coatings were studied by micro-Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy, respectively. Characterization technique, based on least-square fitting to the measured reflectance and transmittance spectra, is used to determine the refractive indices of the crystallized TiO2 coatings. The stability of the synthesized sol was also investigated by dynamic light scattering particle size analyzer. The influence of the thermal annealing on the optical properties was then discussed. The increase in refractive index with high temperature thermal annealing process was observed, obtaining refractive index values from 1.98 to 2.57 at He-Ne laser wavelength of 633 nm. The Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy studies indicate that the index variation is due to the changes in crystalline phase, density, and morphology during thermal annealing. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

The tests were conducted at various saturation pressures from 1.5 MPa to 2.5 MPa for different mass fluxes from 100 kg m −2  s −1  to 250 kg m −2  s −1  over the entire vapor quality range. The effects of mass flux and saturation pressure on two-phase flow pattern transitions were investigated and analyzed. The physical properties of velocity, viscosity and surface tension are important to the flow pattern transition criteria under our experimental conditions. Several two-phase flow pattern maps in horizontal tubes were compared with the experimental data. Finally, a new flow pattern map for R170 in a horizontal tube based on the Kim et al. (2012) map was carried out.",

With their growing popularity, there is a necessity for improving the system throughput and decreasing the turnaround time for co-executing applications on the same GPU device. However, resource contention among multiple applications on a multi-tasked GPU leads to the performance degradation of applications. Previous works are not accurate enough to learn the characteristics of GPU application before execution, or cannot get such information timely, which may lead to misleading scheduling decisions. In this paper, we present GScheduler, a framework to detect and reduce interference for co-executing applications on the GPU-based cloud. The most important feature of GScheduler is to utilize GPU usage pattern extractor for detecting interference between applications. It is composed of key function-call graph extractor and key GPU resource usage vector extractor, the former is used to detect the similarity of GPU usage mode between applications, while the latter is used to calculate the similarity of GPU resource requirements in-between. In addition, an interference aware scheduler is proposed to minimize the interference. We evaluated our framework with 26 diverse, real-world CUDA applications. When compared with state-of the-art interference-oblivious schedulers, our framework improves system throughput by 36% on average, and achieves a 30.5% reduction of turnaround time on average.",

        "abstract": "In this work, influence of the formation of macroscopic dipoles with space charges enclosed in a void (electric domain) and their polarization enhancement on the charging current characteristic and the conductivity of cellular polypropylene (PP) film were studied by the corona charging with a grid in combination with the reverse-polarity corona charging compensation method. By measuring the isothermal surface potential decay and analyses of open-circuit and short-circuit thermally stimulated discharging current spectra, the charge stability and charge dynamics of PP ferroelectrets in relation to the formation and density variety of macroscopy dipoles were also discussed. The experimental results indicate that the decrease of charge stability of cellular PP film with high polarization should be attributed to the increase of the conductivity induced by the self-field of macroscopic dipoles. For cellular electret film with weak polarization, macroscopic dipoles formed by space charges should only be trapped at two sharp ends of lens-like void and, therefore, detrapped charges will transport along the side surfaces at both ends of the void. When the sample has high polarization, the trapped charges are distributed in the whole surface layer of the void. Most of the detrapped charges excited by the electret field drift through the solid dielectric layer between adjacent voids, which leads to their decay.",

In this article, the cause of byproducts formation by thermodynamic analysis is reported. First, the reaction mechanism between HS- and pentavalent vanadium V(V) in desulfurization solution is researched, and it is conclude that HS- can transforms instantly into polysulfide ions Sx 2-, then Sx 2- forms the element sulfur. Thus, Sx 2- is the main source to generate byproducts. Second, by calculating and comparing the Gibbs free energy change of side reactions, the results show that S x 2- is more active than HS- in solution and can react more easily with oxygen to produce byproducts. Therefore, quickening the transformation from Sx 2- to element sulfur is a key measure to resolve the problem on side reaction. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic properties and magnetocaloric effects of the R 6 Co 2 Si 3 compounds with R = Nd and Tb have been investigated by magnetization measurement. The Curie temperature and the saturation moment at 5 K for R 6 Co 2 Si 3 with R = Nd and Tb are determined to be 84.5 and 186.9 K, and 11.3 and 39.5 μ B , respectively. The magnetic entropy change Δ S m of R 6 Co 2 Si 3 with R = Nd and Tb, which originates from a reversible second-order magnetic transition around T C , are obtained to be respectively 5.3 and 6.8 J/(kg K) for a magnetic field change from 0 to 5 T. A high refrigerant capacity for Tb 6 Co 2 Si 3 is found to be 441 J/kg for a field change of 0–5 T, which is due to a broad distribution of the Δ S m peak. Keywords R 6 Co 2 Si 3 compounds Magnetocaloric effect Magnetic properties 1 Introduction Since magnetocaloric effect (MCE) was first discovered by Warburg in 1881 [1] , especially since large magnetic entropy change (Δ S m ) of new magnetic materials such as Gd 5 Si 2 Ge 2 [2] , La(Fe, Si) 13 [3,4] , MnAs 1− x Sb x [5] , MnFeP 1− x As x [6] , Ni 0.5 Mn 0.5− x Sn x [7] , etc. were found, numerous families of magnetocaloric materials have been extensively investigated theoretically and experimentally due to their potential applications as magnetic refrigerants. It has been previously found [2–8] that many of the magnetocaloric materials with first-order magnetic transitions show a large Δ S m , while the materials with second-order ones usually have a relatively low Δ S m . However, the magnetocaloric materials with second-order ones usually exhibit an excellent reversibility of the magnetization in the temperature/magnetic field cycling, and a magnetic hysteresis loss close to zero and a high refrigerant capacity (RC). It is important for using magnetic refrigeration to find appropriate materials that can produce a large Δ S m and a high RC. In the previous studies, Bodak et al. have discovered a family of ternary silicides R 6 Ni 2 Si 3 with R = La, Ce, Pr and Nd [9] , which are determined the structure of the so-called “Ce 6 Ni 2 Si 3 ” compound which crystallises with the space group P 6 3 / m . Recently, Chevalier et al have reported the silicides of R 6 Co 1.67 Si 3 (R = Ce, Nd, Gd, Tb and Dy) derived from the Ce 6 Ni 2 Si 3 -type structure [10,11] , which are of single phase except Dy 6 Co 1.67 Si 3 . An investigation on their magnetic properties has shown that R 6 Co 1.67 Si 3 compounds are ferromagnetic and have a high saturation magnetization. We have studied the magnetic properties and the MCEs of R 6 Co 1.67 Si 3 (R = Pr and Gd) compounds [12,13] . The magnetic entropy changes of 6.9 and 5.3 J/(kg K) for a magnetic field change from 0 to 5 T have been observed for the samples with R = Pr and Gd, respectively. In this paper, we report the magnetic properties and the MCEs of the R 6 Co 2 Si 3 compounds with R = Nd and Tb. 2 Experimental The samples with the nominal composition of R 6 Co 2 Si 3 (R = Tb and Nd) were prepared by arc melting in a high-purity argon atmosphere. The purities of starting materials are 99% for Nd, 99% for Tb, 99.9% for Co, and 99.999% for Si. The samples were turned over and remelted several times to ensure their homogeneity. Ingots obtained by arc melting were wrapped with a molybdenum foil, sealed in a quartz tube of high vacuum, annealed at 1073 K for 30 days and then quenched to room temperature. Finally, ingots were ground into powders. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements on powder samples were performed by using Cu Kα radiation to identify the phase purity and the crystal structure. Magnetization was measured as a function of temperature and magnetic field by using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. 3 Results and discussion The room-temperature powder XRD patterns and the thermomagnetic M – T curves under an external magnetic field of 0.01 T for R 6 Co 2 Si 3 with R = Nd and Tb were measured. The powder XRD patterns of the two samples are shown in Fig. 1 . Both the two samples have a single phase with a hexagonal Ce 6 Ni 2 Si 3 -type structure (space group P 6 3 / m ) [9] . Fig. 2 shows the temperature dependence of their magnetization cooled in zero field (ZFC curve) and after cooling in a field of 0.01 T (FC curve). It can be seen from Fig. 2 (a) that in the ZFC curve the magnetization for Nd 6 Co 2 Si 3 exhibits two maximum values with temperature increasing, correspondingly, two rapid decrease of magnetization occurring at T t (about 35 K) and Curie temperature T C , respectively. The value of T C of Nd 6 Co 2 Si 3 is determined to be 84.5 K. The magnetization in the FC curve exhibits also two sharply decrease with temperatures near T t and T C , respectively. These results reveal the existence of two magnetic transitions for Nd 6 Co 2 Si 3 although its XRD measurements have verified it to be of single phase. This is probably due to the existence of two different kinds of environments for rare earth atoms in the Ce 6 Ni 2 Si 3 -type ternary silicides [11] . It is also observed from the ZFC and FC curves in Fig. 2 (b) that the Tb 6 Co 2 Si 3 has two magnetic transitions. The transition at 170 K corresponds probably to a spin reorientation [11] . The transition at a higher temperature is a change from ferromagnetic state to paramagnetic state with a Curie temperature T C = 186.9 K. It is found from Fig. 2 that the ZFC curves and the FC curves for R 6 Co 2 Si 3 with R = Nd and Tb are completely reversible around T C as shown usually in magnetic materials with a second-order magnetic transition. However, a strong irreversibility between the ZFC curves and the FC curves appears below T C , indicating that the magnetization at low temperatures has a significantly thermal history dependence as shown in R 6 Co 1.67 Si 3 (R = Nd, Pr and Tb) [11,12] . The reciprocal magnetic susceptibility χ m −1 versus temperature for Nd 6 Co 2 Si 3 in a field of 2 T is shown in the inset of Fig. 2 (a). The magnetic susceptibility of the Nd 6 Co 2 Si 3 compound above 110 K perfectly follows the Curie–Weiss law χ m −1 = ( T − θ p )/ C m , where θ p is the paramagnetic Curie temperature and C m is the Curie–Weiss constant. The value of θ p for Nd 6 Co 2 Si 3 is positive and equals 86.5 K. The C m is found to be 9.98 emu K mol −1 , giving an effective magnetic moment μ eff = 3.65 μ B per Nd atom, which is close to the value expected for a free Nd 3+ ion ( μ eff = 3.62 μ B ). Also, the Tb 6 Co 2 Si 3 follows the Curie–Weiss law with a positive θ p = 193 K and an effective moment μ eff = 9.9 μ B per Tb atom slightly larger than the value expected for a free Tb 3+ ion (9.72 μ B ). These results mean that the Co atoms are non-magnetic in the R 6 Co 2 Si 3 compounds with R = Nd and Tb as observed in R 6 Co 1.67 Si 3 (R = Nd and Tb) [11] . Fig. 3 shows the field dependence of magnetization of R 6 Co 2 Si 3 with R = Nd and Tb at 5 K. Magnetization curve exhibits a difficult saturation state even though the applied magnetic field goes up to 5 T. The “saturation moments” per Nd 6 Co 2 Si 3 and Tb 6 Co 2 Si 3 molecule at 5 K and in a field of 5 T are 11.3 and 39.5 μ B , respectively. For Nd 6 Co 2 Si 3 and Tb 6 Co 2 Si 3 , therefore, the average magnetic moments per Nd and Tb atom are 1.9 and 6.6 μ B , which are obviously smaller than those calculated for a free Nd 3+ ion (3.27 μ B ) and Tb 3+ ion (9 μ B ), respectively. This may be due to the occurrence of different moments on the two inequivalent sites of R atoms in the ternary silicides [11] . Fig. 4 shows the magnetization isotherms of R 6 Co 2 Si 3 with R = Nd and Tb measured around the Curie temperatures under magnetic fields up to 5 T. Our investigation reveals that each isotherm near T C shows a reversible behaviour between the field increase and the field decrease and neither inflection nor negative slope in their Arrott plot (not presented here) is observed as a signature of metamagnetic transition above the T C , indicating a characteristic of second-order magnetic transition. This result is advantageous for practical applications of the materials. In an isothermal process of magnetization, the magnetic entropy change of the materials can be derived from Maxwell relation by integrating the magnetization M over the magnetic field H , i.e. (1) Δ S m ( T , H ) = S m ( T , H ) − S m ( T , 0 ) = ∫ 0 H ∂ M ∂ T H   d H . To derive the temperature dependence of magnetic entropy change, the following numerical approximation of the integral is usually applied: (2) | Δ S m | = ∑ i M i − M i + 1 T i + 1 − T i   Δ H i , where M i and M i +1 are the experimental values of the magnetization measured at T i and T i +1 in an applied magnetic field H i , respectively. The Δ S m associated with the field variation for the R 6 Co 2 Si 3 compounds is calculated according to expression (2) . Fig. 5 shows the temperature dependences of the Δ S m for R 6 Co 2 Si 3 with R = Nd and Tb, indicating that the peak temperatures of Δ S m have no change and both the peak and the width of Δ S m increase obviously with the increase of applied magnetic field. The maximum values of Δ S m for R 6 Co 2 Si 3 with R = Nd and Tb reach 5.3 and 6.8 J/(kg K) for a field change of 0–5 T, respectively. From the present study it is shown that the magnetic entropy changes of R 6 Co 2 Si 3 compounds with R = Nd and Tb originate from a reversible second-order magnetic transition. The values of RC for R 6 Co 2 Si 3 with R = Nd and Tb are calculated by using the Gschneidner's method, in which the area under the Δ S m – T curve is integrated numerically by using the temperatures at half maximum of the Δ S m peak as the integration limits [14] . The values of RC for R 6 Co 2 Si 3 with R = Nd and Tb are found to increase almost linearly with applied magnetic field and reach 115 and 441 J/kg for a magnetic field change from 0 to 5 T, respectively. The high RC for Tb 6 Co 2 Si 3 results from a broad distribution of the Δ S m peak. In fact, it is observed that the full width at half maximum of the Δ S m peak is 85.4 K under a magnetic fields of 5 T. For the RC value, the hysteresis loss must be taken into account. However, the present study on R 6 Co 2 Si 3 reveals no hysteresis loss in the measured magnetic field range. Furthermore, a reversible behaviour for the field increasing/decreasing cycles around T C is observed. This is of practical importance, because a completely reversible MCE requires no hysteresis in the magnetization as a function of both temperature and magnetic field. 4 Conclusion The single-phase R 6 Co 2 Si 3 (R = Nd and Tb) compounds with a hexagonal Ce 6 Ni 2 Si 3 -type structure are prepared and their magnetic properties and magnetocaloric effects are investigated by magnetization measurement. Both the Nd 6 Co 2 Si 3 and Tb 6 Co 2 Si 3 compounds shows a reversible second-order magnetic transition at Curie temperature T C = 84.5 and 186.9 K, respectively, and undergoes two magnetic transitions below T C . The values of the Δ S m and the RC for R 6 Co 2 Si 3 with R = Nd and Tb are found to increase monotonously with applied magnetic field and reach 5.3 and 6.8 J/(kg K), and 115 and 441 J/kg for a field change of 0–5 T, respectively. For Tb 6 Co 2 Si 3 , the full width at half maximum of the Δ S m peak under a magnetic field of 5 T is 85.4 K, which leads to a high RC.

We have applied the CAS-BCCC4 approach to investigate energy barriers for several reactions (the ring-opening isomerization of the cyclopropyl radical, cyclobutene, cyclobutadiene, and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-ene), spectroscopic constants in several multibond diatomic molecules (C(2), O(2), CO, and N(2)), and singlet-triplet gaps in two diradicals (trimethylenemethane and oxyallyl). A comparison of CAS-BCCC4 results with the experimental data or other theoretical estimates shows that the present approach can provide very satisfactory descriptions for all the studied systems.",

The results of experimental observation and theoretical inference can be summarized as follows. If the melt thickness a is sufficiently large, providing a ratio of plate thickness to current theoretical skin depth, a / δ >2.2, the electromagnetic pressure acting on the melt can be expressed simply as P m = B 2 /2 μ , and the melt shape can be known just by measuring the distribution of the magnetic flux density. If a is small and makes the ratio a / δ <2.2, the melt shape and the electromagnetic pressure for confining and shaping are determined not only by the magnetic flux density B , but also by the melt thickness a , the electromagnetic parameter μγ and the current frequency f. In this paper, an equation for calculating the electromagnetic pressure acting on a “thin plate-form melt” is proposed. The equation gives the precise relationship between the electromagnetic pressure factor p and the melt thickness a , the electromagnetic parameter μγ and the current frequency f .",

        "abstract": "Semantic Web services, one of the most significant areas in the emerging business process management systems, have attracted\n a great deal of effort from both academic and industry community. Traditional methodologies are still very inadequate to effectively\n and autonomously conduct service discovery and composition in a dynamic environment, as they seldom focus on dealing with\n real complex situations, such as simultaneously considering peers’ multiple specifications which reflect different properties\n of e-services. Different ontology based e-service profiles have been proposed to enhance service oriented framework for the\n total or partial automation of service invocation, discovery, selection and composition, which are involved in either centralised\n or decentralised deployment of services. In this paper, we propose a modelling based approach to design and develop a peer-to-peer\n based service coordination system and their components. The peer profiles are described with the WSMO (Web Service Modelling\n Ontology) standard, mainly for quality of service and geographic features of the e-services, which would be invoked by various\n peers. To fully explore the usability of service categorisation and mining, we implemented an ontology driven unified algorithm\n to select the most appropriate peers. The UOW-SWS prototype also shows that the enhanced peer coordination is more adaptive\n and effective in dynamic business processes.\n ",

The infrared spectra and time-of-flight mass specta show that fullerenes were successfully incorporated inside the silica aerogel and the fullerene structures were retained in the fabrication process. The photoluminescence from the fullerene-doped sample showed broad visible light peaking at about 2.26eV under Ar+ laser(488nm) at room temperature. The photoluminescene was found to be red shifted while the doping concentration was increased. This effect is consistent with the behaviour of confined fullerenes in the pores of the silica aerogel resulting in the quantum confinement effect which produces emission far above the interband gap of C60/C70.",

In order to make the whole city’s traffic highly efficient, the fog computing paradigm and a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm is designed to overcome communication bandwidth limitation and local optimal traffic control flow, respectively.

        "abstract": "The explosion of digital data and the dependence on data-intensive services have been recognized as the most significant characteristics of IT trends in the current decade. Designing workflow of data-intensive services requires data analysis from multiple sources to get required composite services. Composing such services requires effective transfer of large data. Thus many new challenges are posed to control the cost and revenue of the whole composition. This paper addresses the data-intensive service composition and presents an innovative data-intensive service selection algorithm based on a modified genetic algorithm. The performance of this new algorithm is also tested by simulations and compared against other traditional approaches, such as mix integer programming. The contributions of this paper are three folds: 1) An economical model for data-intensive service provision is proposed, 2) An extensible QoS model is also proposed to calculate the QoS values of data-intensive services, 3) Finally, a modified genetic algorithm-based approach is introduced to compose data-intensive services. A local selection method with modifications of crossover and mutation operators is adopted for this algorithm. The results of experiments will demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.",

However, the practical application faces a big obstacle regarding current fluctuation and deterioration of the CNT cathode. In this research, the formation of amorphous carbon (ac) layer between the CNT film and the substrate, and the effect of the existence of this layer on field emission stability of the CNT film are studied. The formation of the ac layer could be controlled by adjustment of growth temperature and hydrocarbon flow rate. The field emission character and current stability of the CNT film without ac layer are better than those of the CNT film with ac layer. The results attribute to the ac layer a thermal disequilibrium state under high current level. Moreover, adhesion capacity of the CNT film without ac layer is also better than that with the ac layer. It is concluded that the ac layer between the CNT film and substrate is a key factor in the stability of field emission characteristics and should be eliminated before applications.",

Thus, scientists have started to explore low-cost and easy preparation processes of silica aerogels. In this work, a low-cost method was proposed to prepare silica aerogels with industrial silica hydrosol and a subsequent ambient pressure drying (APD) process. Various surfactants (cationic, amphoteric, or anionic) were added to avoid solvent exchange and surface modification during the APD process. The effects of various surfactants on the microstructure, thermal conductivity, and thermal stability of the silica aerogels were studied. The results showed that the silica aerogels prepared with a cationic or anionic surfactant have better thermal stability than that prepared with an amphoteric surfactant. After being heated at 600 °C, the silica aerogel prepared with a cationic surfactant showed the highest specific surface area of 131 m²∙g and the lowest thermal conductivity of 0.038 W∙m∙K. The obtained low-cost silica aerogel with low thermal conductivity could be widely applied as a thermal insulator for building and industrial energy-saving applications.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the value of ECG editing in improving the image quality of 64-slice spiral CT coronary angiography in the presence of arrhythmia or unidentify synchronously record ECG error. Methods: Retrospectively ECG-gated MSCT coronary angiography of 22 patients with previously known arrhythmia or arrhythmia merely occurred during examination or unindentify ECG mechanic error happened during examination were included. The coronary angiography were obtaind respectviely using original synchronously record ECG or using the ECG after edited with the built-in ECG editing software. The image quality of reconstructed coronary arteries was compared before and after the editing of synchronously record ECG. Results: Of 22 patients, 14 had previously known arrhythmia including 4 auriculo-ventricular block, 4 atrial fibrilation and 2 occasional premature ventricualr contraction; 7 had arrhythmia occurred during examination including 2 atrial fibrilation and 4 atrial fibrilation and 1 sick sinus syndroms; 1 had unindentified paritally ECG misssing. The arrhythmia and ECG partially missing resulted in blurring, segemental missing, significant stepladder artifacts of reconstructed coronary arteries using original ECG and 53% (172/325) coronanry segements were assessable for diagnosis. After ECG editing, the image quality of coronary segements was obviously improved with an increase of the assessable sgements to 96% (313/325). There was significantly statistical difference between them (X 2 = 161. 4826, P<0. 001). Conclusion: The ECG editing could be used to markedly improve the image quality of MSCT coronary angiography in the presence of arrhythmia during the examination or unkown mechanic ECG failure.",

Here we show that ~40 nm cationic nanoparticles (cNP) can scavenge cfDNA derived from RA patients and inhibit the activation of primary synovial fluid monocytes and fibroblast-like synoviocytes. Using clinical scoring, micro-CT images, MRI, and histology, we show that intravenous injection of cNP into a CpG-induced mouse model or collagen-induced arthritis rat model can relieve RA symptoms including ankle and tissue swelling, and bone and cartilage damage. This culminates in the manifestation of partial mobility recovery of the treated rats in a rotational cage test. Mechanistic studies on intracellular trafficking and biodistribution of cNP, as well as measurement of cytokine expression in the joints and cfDNA levels in systemic circulation and inflamed joints also correlate with therapeutic outcomes. This work suggests a new direction of nanomedicine in treating inflammatory diseases.",

The current study was designed to observe the morphological features of REP on magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) and to investigate its diagnostic value.The MRI of 160 lesions with the diagnosis of temporal lobe REP on MRI was retrospectively analyzed in 104 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The MRI was performed after radiation therapy of NPC with an interval ranged from 8 months to 13 years. The imaging sequences included T1-weighted imaging and T2-weighted imaging additionally. T1-weighted imaging with injection of the contrast agent of Gd-DTPA was performed in 111 lesions and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) was obtained in 37 lesions, MR perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) was performed in 2 of them.Unilateral temporal lobe was involved in 48 cases of REP, bilateral temporal lobe in 56 cases of REP respectively, with totally 160 lesions founded. The REP in the white matter displayed hyper-intensity signal on T2-weighted imaging which could be homogenous, whereas area with heterogeneous hypo-intensity signal could be seen in 59 of them otherwise with hyper-intensity signal, and 91 lesions of white matter were associated with gray matter lesions with an appearance of hypo-intensity signal on T1-weighted imaging and hyper-intensity signal on T2-weighted imaging. In 111 lesions with the Gd-DTPA enhanced T1-weigthed imaging, 91 showed the enhancement of brain parencyma. Hemorrhage and hemosiderosis were found in 5 lesions of REP.REP in NPC has a multiplicity of the imaging features on MRI, in addition to the common involvement of white matter, including other relatively frequent findings, such as the involvement of gray matter, hemorrhage, hemosiderosis and blood-brain barrier destruction, those could be clearly revealed on MRI.",

Measurements were carried out over temperatures from (255.048 to 300.135) K and mole fractions of R1234yf at (0.113, 0.217, 0.322, 0.422, 0.533, 0.625). The experimental standard uncertainties were estimated to be less than 5 mK for the temperature, 2 kPa for the pressure, 0.003 for the mole fraction and 0.02% for the density. The experimental bubble point pressures were correlated by the Peng-Robinson equation of state, while the experimental saturated liquid densities were represented with the VDNS and our modified Rackett equations. In addition, saturated liquid densities of azeotropy point at temperatures  T  = (253.150, 263.150, 273.150, 283.150 and 293.150) K were determined based on our previous and present work.",

        "abstract": "To observe the longitudinal changes of nerve repair in rats after tissue-engineered construct implantation at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and to determine whether the enhanced nerve regeneration with use of tissue-engineered constructs could be monitored with gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging or nerve T2 relaxation time measurement.All experimental protocols were approved by the institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. Tissue-engineered constructs were prepared by seeding mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into chitosan nerve tubes. Thirty-six rats with sciatic nerve transection injury underwent nerve tube implantation with (n = 18) or without (n = 18) MSC seeding. Sequential T2 measurement, gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging, and sciatic function index measurement were performed over an 8-week follow-up period, with histologic assessments performed at regular intervals. T2 relaxation times and signal intensity at gadofluorine M-enhanced T1-weighted imaging were measured and were compared by using repeated-measures analysis of variance followed by the Student-Neuman-Keuls post-hoc test for multiple pairwise comparisons.Nerve T2 relaxation times and gadofluorine M enhancement, as well as functional changes, showed a similar time course. Nerves implanted with MSC-seeded tubes achieved slightly better functional recovery and enhanced nerve regeneration while showing a slower return to baseline T2 relaxation time and a more rapid decline in gadofluorine M enhancement compared with nerves implanted with chitosan tubes alone. T2 values of the distal portion of transected nerves showed a more rapid return to baseline level than did gadofluorine M enhancement.Peripheral nerve repair with use of tissue-engineered constructs can be monitored by using gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging and T2 relaxation time measurements. T2 relaxation time seems more sensitive than gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging for detecting nerve regeneration.",

The common intracellular delivery of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) via poly-L-lysine (PLL) requires a high SPION concentration and a long incubation period for appropriate cell labeling, which may negatively affect the viability and function of stem cells. In this study, we determined the performance of a new class of cationic polymersomes in transferring SPIONs into green fluorescence protein-modified mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for cellular MRI in acute ischemic stroke, compared with PLL-coated SPIONs. The results demonstrated that the polymersomes had comparable labeling efficiency and biological safety as well as a marginal benefit on post-transplantation cell survival; the polymersomes had the advantages of a relatively low SPION concentration and a substantially shorter labeling period compared with PLL-coated SPIONs. After transplantation, MSCs labeled using both methods offered a similar therapeutic effect on stroke, and cellular MRI could track the in vivo distribution and migration behavior of biologically active MSCs; however, MRI overestimated the true size of the cell grafts. SPION-loaded cationic polymersomes can be used as an alternative for the efficient, rapid, and safe labeling of stem cells for cellular MRI.",

By designing a gasochromic-Pd-WO 3 /graphene/Si tandem structure, here we report an optoelectronic hydrogen sensor, which is working at the room temperature. In this device architecture, the graphene/Si acts as a photodetector layer by using its photovoltaic property and the tandem Pd-WO 3  film serves as a hydrogen gas sensing layer by using its gasochromic behavior. While the device is exposed to the hydrogen gas, the transmittance of the Pd-WO 3  can be tuned, which is synchronously sensed by the graphene/Si photodetector. With this principle, the device can detect the hydrogen gas with the concentration down to 0.05 vol% and the response time less than 13 s and the recovery time less than 43 s.

        "abstract": "An alignment method with inertial frame based on gravity information was described. On this basis, the strap-down inertial navigation system(SINS) error equations which use the geocentric inertial frame as the navigation reference frame were deduced. A state model which matches the inertial frame alignment algorithm was established, and a novel SINS alignment algorithm based on inertial frame filtering for marching vehicles was proposed. Computer simulation results demonstrate that the initial alignment algorithm based on inertial frame filtering for marching vehicles can solve the problem of large interference angular velocity. Real-time filter scheme can further reduce the effect of the noise and improve the accuracy of initial alignment. Besides, compared with the alignment algorithm based on geographic frame filtering, it simplifies the model and reduces the computational complexity.",

        "abstract": "The evolution of structure and properties of nano-porous silica films was investigated under different experimental conditions. A new method to adjust refractive index of the films rapidly and continuously is reported. The thin films were prepared with the base, acid one-step and base/acid two-step catalytic sol-gel processes and the dip-coating method. The structure and properties of the films were analyzed by atom force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photo electron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared, ellipsometry, separately. From the base one-step, the base/acid two-step, and the acid one-step catalytic process, silica particles in the films become small, the porosity decreases, and the refractive index increases continuously from 1.18 to 1.41. XPS analysis has shown Si2p peak shifts to a higher binding energy and near that of the silica bulk. The frequency shift of ω4(transverse optical mode) of infrared absorption to a lower wave number indicates a decrease in the average Si-O-Si bridging angle. These results suggest that the effect of the above experimental conditions on properties of nano-porous silica films is attributed to the change of the silica structure of the films.",

Free-standing hierarchical porous tantalum monoliths have been obtained for the first time from tantalum oxide xerogels as templates via low temperature magnesiothermic reduction. The similar morphology of tantalum products to that of tantalum oxide xerogels was retained after magnesiothermic reduction and hydrochloric acid etching. Monolithic porous tantalum is composed of cubic Ta nanocrystals, and possessed a high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area (58 m2/g). The synthetic mechanism of porous nanocrystlline tantalum was also described. More importantly, combining the template confined route with displacement reaction, the strategy could be used to prepare 3D porous metals from porous metal oxides under relatively mild conditions. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A precursor sol containing tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), the surfactant template cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and acid catalyst was prepared by sol–gel process. The hexagonal ordered structure of the calcined mesoporous silica film was confirmed by TEM. The refractive index of the directly calcined film is 1.18, the film thickness is about 180 nm, which was performed by spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements. The dielectric constant k of the directly calcined film was 2.14.

DS ingots with fully lamellar microstructure parallel to longitudinal axis (DS direction) were successfully obtained at a low growth rate of 60 mm/h. Increasing further the growth rate, the orientation of lamellar microstructure was no longer parallel to the DS direction and an angle of about 45° or 90° appeared between lamellar orientation and DS direction because of the variations of constitutional undercooling and temperature gradient. The distance between the transition point and the seed decreased with the increase of growth rate.

With increasing growth velocity, the solid/liquid interface was changed from cellular to dendritic. The grain boundary turned vague, and the lamellae within the grains became distorted. When the growth velocity increased to 200 μm/s, some γ phases and α phases appeared in local region owing to the enrichment of Al solute. The columnar grain size (λ), interdendritic spacing (λ 1), and interlamellar spacing (λ L) were measured, and the effects of growth velocity on these parameters were discussed. As the growth velocity increased, both the microhardness and the 0.2% offset compression yield stress increased continuously. However, the value of yield stress decreased slightly when the growth velocity increased to 200 μm/s, which resulted from the appearance of γ phases.",

Using a filtered cathodic vacuum arc plasma deposition system (FCVAPD), the amorphous diamond (a-D) film was deposited on both non-treated and etched silicon wafers (n-type and p-type). The field electron emission characteristic was measured before and after depositing a-D film. The a-D film on etched silicon wafer shows distinct increase in emission current compared with that on non-treated silicon wafer.

        "abstract": "In this paper,the solubility of hydrogen in naphthalene was measured by using vapor-liquid phase equilibrium sampling method.The reaction mechanism of hydrogen for direct coal liquefaction was investigated by liquefaction of Yanzhou coal using a 17 mL tubular resonance agitation microautoclave reactor.The results show:1) that hydrogen solubility in naphthalene increases with the increase of temperature and hydrogen partial pressure,and the solution rate overall appears first quick back slow trend.Hydrogen solubility within 5 min has reached 76.21% of the maximum under certain temperature and hydrogen partial pressure,then it continues to increase slowly and achieves the maximum for 30 min;2) that the control step of coal liquefaction without catalyst in naphthalene is not the solution rate of hydrogen but the reaction rate of dissolved hydrogen participating in liquefaction;3) that hydrogen pre-solution in naphthalene increases the total conversion of shorter coal liquefaction without catalyst,which is because partial dissolved hydrogen was activated in pre-solution process,resulting in the increase of active hydrogen in the initial stage of liquefaction reaction;4) that hydrogen pre-solution in naphthalene has a little contribution for the total conversion of longer coal liquefaction without catalyst,but it promotes the further hydrocracking and upgrading of liquefaction products.",

The accuracy of the densimeter was verified by the experimental performance of HC290 (propane) at temperatures from 253.432 to 293.312 K. The standard uncertainties of HFO1234ze(E) in temperature, pressure and density were estimated to be less than 5 mK, 1 kPa and 0.01%, respectively. Comparisons were made between the present vapor pressures and other experimental data available in the open literature, and good agreement was found, while the saturated liquid densities were reproduced by five equations of state in Wagner-type or Rackett-type, and good agreement was found among them. Finally, two recommended equations for saturated liquid densities of HFO1234ze(E) were obtained with a valid temperature range from 251.450 to 382.504 K.",

The results show that with increasing of heating rates, all the characteristic temperatures including glass transition temperature Tg, onset crystallization temperature Tx and peak crystallization temperatures Tp1 and Tp2 shift to higher temperatures while the relationship between the characteristic temperatures and the heating rates obeys the first order exponential decay relation. The activation energies Eg, Ex, and Ep, corresponding to characteristic temperatures Tg, Tx, and Tp, respectively, were obtained from the Kissinger and Ozawa equations. The calculated activation energies show good agreement by the Kissinger or Ozawa equations due to the almost invariability of the crystallization volume fraction at the characteristic temperatures for different heating rates.

Many types of banded structure were obtained, which cannot be interpreted by the Karma’s model. The reason for this conflict is that there are many banded structure formation mechanisms such as abundant nucleation, regrowth, fast radial cellular growth and radial competitive growth under convection condition, but the Karma’s model only considers the abundant nucleation and ignores other mechanisms. The analyses showed that these formation mechanisms changed along with an increase in alloy composition. Based on these analyses, a simple modified banding window, which considered these different formation mechanisms, has been presented. Compared with the banding window defined by the Karma’s model, this modified banding window contained it and could predict different banded structure formations under convection condition appropriately.",

        "abstract": "Distinct regions of the primitive streak (PS) have diverse potential to differentiate into several tissues, including the hematopoietic lineage originated from the posterior region of PS. Although various signaling pathways have been identified to promote the development of PS and its mesoderm derivatives, there is a large gap in our understanding of signaling pathways that regulate the hematopoietic fate of PS. Here, we defined the roles of Wnt, activin, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways in generating hematopoietic-fated PS from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). We found that the synergistic balance of these signaling pathways was crucial for controlling the PS fate determination towards hematopoietic lineage via mesodermal progenitors. Although the induction of PS depends largely on the Wnt and activin signaling, the PS generated without BMP4 lacks the hematopoietic potential, indicating that the BMP signaling is necessary for the PS to acquire hematopoietic property. Appropriate levels of Wnt signaling is crucial for the development of PS and its specification to the hematopoietic lineage. Although the development of PS is less sensitive to activin or BMP signaling, the fate of PS to mesoderm progenitors and subsequent hematopoietic lineage is determined by appropriate levels of activin or BMP signaling. Collectively, our study demonstrates that Wnt, activin, and BMP signaling pathways play cooperative and distinct roles in regulating the fate determination of PS for hematopoietic development. Our understanding of the regulatory networks of hematopoietic-fated PS would provide important insights into early hematopoietic patterning and possible guidance for generating functional hematopoietic cells from hPSCs in vitro.",

The apparent activation energy derived from the Kissinger plots for glass transition E g is higher than that for crystallization E p and E x calculated by the peak temperature T p and onset crystallization temperature T x during the continuous heating process. The isothermal activation energy obtained using Arrhenius equation shows that it increases accompanying the proceeding of the crystallization transformation. The incubation time of crystallization becomes longer and the crystallization process becomes slower as the annealing temperature is reducing during the isothermal process. The crystallization mechanism was studied using Kolmogorov–Johnson–Mehl–Avrami (KJMA) equation. The results indicate that the Avrami exponent n ≈2 at the initial crystallization stage, and it alters gradually following the increasing crystallization volume fraction.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   How to achieve fast and efficient resource allocation is an important optimization problem of resource management in cloud data center. On one hand, in order to ensure the user experience of resource requesting, the system has to achieve fast resource allocation to timely process resource requests; on the other hand, in order to ensure the efficiency of resource allocation, how to allocate multi-dimensional resource requests to servers needs to be optimized, such that serveru0027s resource utilization can be improved. However, most of existing approaches focus on finding out the mapping of each specific resource request to each specific server. This makes the complexity of resource allocation problem increases with the size of data center. Thus, these approaches cannot achieve fast and efficient resource allocation for large-scale data center. To address this problem, we propose a pattern based resource allocation mechanism based on the following findings. In a real-world cloud environment, the resource requests are usually classified into limited types. Thus, the mechanism first utilizes this feature to generate pattern information, which indicates which types of resource requests are suitable to be allocated together to a server. Then, the mechanism uses the pattern information as guidelines to make fast resource allocation decision and fully utilize serveru0027s multidimensional resources. Simulation experiments based on real and synthetic traces have shown that our mechanism significantly improves systemu0027s resource utilization and reduces the overall number of used servers.",

        "abstract": "Controlled synthesis of ultra-long AlN nanowire arrays in different growth density has been successfully realized by direct nitridation of Al powders for the first time. These AlN nanowires have an average diameter of about 100 nm and their mean length is over 50m. All the synthesized ultra-long nanowires are pure single crystalline h-AlN structures with the growth orientation of [0001]. We propose the self-catalyzing vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism to illustrate their growth process. The field emission (FE) properties of three samples with different growth density of ultra-long AlN nanowire are compared, which shows that the sample with the most suitable growth density exhibits the best FE behaviors. Moreover, the FE performance of ultra-long AlN nanowire arrays is better than many nanostructures with excellent FE properties, which suggests that they should have a more promising future in vacuum electron devices if their emission uniformity can be effectively improved. © 2010 IEEE.",

All lesions showed moderate to marked enhancement, but homogeneously in well-differentiated tumors while heterogeneously in most of poorly differentiated tumors.

Polyethoxy-disiloxanes (E-40), ethanol (EtOH), hydrogen fluoride (HF) were used as silican precursor, solvent and catalyst, respectively, followed by solvent substitution and surface modification to prepare silica aerogels. Scanning electronic microscopy, nitrogen adsorption analyzer, contact angle measurement and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to characterize the structure and properties of silica aerogels. The conclusion is that the silica aerogels are with good hydrophobicity and the gas adsorption capacities is excellent for toxic gases such as benzene and carbon tetrachloride, which is 2∼3 times higher than that of activated carbon fiber (ACF) or granule of activated carbon (GAC). Moreover, the adsorption capacity for organic solvent is 20-30 times of its own weight, which is much larger than that of GAC or Poly vinyl alcohol (PVA). In addition, the adsorption capacity of silica aerogels remains almost the same value after two times of adsorption-desorption processes, which means that the process is recyclable, low-cost and environmental friendly. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.",

        "abstract": "Zr–Cu–Ni–Al quaternary amorphous alloy compositions with varying glass-forming ability are developed by an efficient method of proportional mixing of binary eutectics. The critical diameter of the glassy sample is improved from 6 mm for Zr 53 Cu 18.7 Ni 12 Al 16.3 to 14 mm for Zr 50.7 Cu 28 Ni 9 Al 12.3 by straightforwardly adjusting the eutectic unit’s coefficients. The drastic improvement in GFA is attributed to balancing the chemical affinities of the Zr, Cu, Ni and Al components in the melt prior to solidification which makes the precipitation of competing crystalline phases more difficult. As the glass-forming ability increases, the concentration of Cu in the alloys exhibits a same trend. Based on synchrotron radiation high-energy X-ray diffraction analysis and Miracle’s structural model, it is envisioned that the substitution of additional Cu atoms for Zr atoms in the investigated alloys stabilizes the efficient cluster packing structure of the amorphous alloys, leading to the pronounced increase in their glass-forming ability.

De différents systèmes peuvent être utilisés, certains sont basés sur les données numériques connues et d'autres, sur les connaissances des experts. En général, ils ont des difficultés pour intégrer à la fois les deux types de connaissances, c'est-à-dire, les connaissances des experts et celles impliquées dans les données numériques connues. Dans cet article, nous proposons d'utiliser les systèmes de neurones flous avec des fonctions d'appartenance π non-symétriques. Un nouveau critère à optimiser et l'algorithme d'apprentissage pour tels systèmes sont également présentés. Les résultats expérimentaux des applications sur des problèmes d'interpolation, d'estimation and de classification sont illustrés. La comparaison avec d'autres méthodes montre la meilleure performance de notre système. La fonction d'appartenance de forme π_non-symétrique donne une modélisation plus générale des règles floues, permettant ainsi d'améliorer la précision des systèmes de neurones flous et d'assurer une bonne convergence en apprentissage. Les systèmes de neurones flous avec des fonctions d'appartenance π non-symétriques rendent possible d'intégrer à la fois les connaissances des experts et les connaissances impliquées dans les données numériques d'apprentissage dans un seul système.",

        "abstract": "The exploration practice and integrated sequence-stratigraphic studies for years demonstrated that the Oligocene-Miocene boundary was an important transfer interface of sedimentary-tectonic-climate conditions in the Pearl River Mouth Basin and corresponded to the Baiyun movement(in about 23.8 Ma), during which the seafloor spreading ridge of the South China Sea jumped, was deflected and accompanied with material source changes of the paleo-Pearl River. This event resulted in the shift of the shelf slope-break zone from the neighborhood of the southern uplift area of the Baiyun Depression in late Oligocene to the northern slope in Miocene. Moreover, the shelf slope-break zone has basically stood there since about 21 Ma. In Oligocene-Miocene, two shelf slope-break zones with different development types and locations controlled the development of the two different sequence units in the Baiyun Depression, i.e. a depositional shelf slope-break zone extending in NNE orientation shifted from NW to SE until 23.8 Ma and developed a regressive progradation sequence unit in the Zhuhai Formation, and subsequently, another shelf slope-break zone with NE strike has stood steadily around the north slope of the Baiyun Depression since 21 Ma and formed a transgressive aggradation sequence unit. Moreover, the migration of shelf slope-break zones also controlled the development of prospective reservoirs and hydrocarbon accumulation belts(including shallow marine delta with relatively abundant sand, lowstand shelf-edge delta and deepwater fan sandstones in the continental slope of the Pearl River) within various sequences of the Baiyun deepwater area. It was confirmed that both SQ23.8 and SQ21.0 third-grade sequences were the product of sedimentation corresponding to the Baiyun Movement, and they were of conditions to develop lowstand deepwater fans with most abundant sand in the Baiyun deepwater area. Integrated investigations basically demonstrated that reservoir-seal assemblages of the Oligocene Pearl River coast-delta-deepwater fan depositional system and Neogene deepwater deposits were major objective strata for further exploration. Up to now, natural gas discoveries in the Baiyun deepwater area and Panyu gas province have confirmed the control effect of the shelf slope-break zones on gas reservoirs, indicating a great potential of petroleum exploration in the Baiyun deep-water slope area of the northern South China Sea.",

        "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a promising cellular vehicle for gene therapy of malignant gliomas due to their property of tumor tropism. However, MSCs may show bidirectional and divergent effects on tumor growth. Therefore, a robust surveillance system with a capacity for noninvasive monitoring of the homing, distribution and fate of stem cells in vivo is highly desired for developing stem cell-based gene therapies for tumors. In this study, we used ferritin gene-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to track the tumor tropism of MSCs in a rat orthotopic xenograft model of malignant glioma. MSCs were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing ferritin heavy chain (FTH) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Intra-arterial, intravenous and intertumoral injections of these FTH transgenic MSCs (FTH-MSCs) were performed in rats bearing intracranial orthotopic C6 gliomas. The FTH-MSCs were detected as hypointense signals on T2- and T2*-weighted images on a 3.0 T clinical MRI. After intra-arterial injection, 17% of FTH-MSCs migrated toward the tumor and gradually diffused throughout the orthotopic glioma. This dynamic process could be tracked in vivo by MRI up to 10 days of follow up, as confirmed by histology. Moreover, the tumor tropism of MSCs showed no appreciable impact on the progression of the tumor. These results suggest that FTH reporter gene-based MRI can be used to reliably track the tropism and fate of MSCs after their systemic transplantation in orthotopic gliomas. This real-time in vivo tracking system will facilitate the future development of stem cell-based therapies for malignant gliomas. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "The basic features of the major thrust fault-fold region of Xinjiang were introduced, as well as the problems on the determination of the potential earthquake source in these region were preliminarily discussed in this paper. The thrust systems on the piedmont of northern Tianshan and in the south of Urumqi city are comparatively simple in structure, which are composed of foot thrust fault, thrust sheet and front thrust fault-fold. It is very likely that high grade area of strong ground motion will located along the foot thrust fault and the surface rupture and deformation will appear along the front thrust fault-fold. The Keping thrust and Kuqa thrust, as well as the arcuate thrust in the northeastern margin of Pamir are also composed of foot thrust fault, thrust sheet and front thrust fault-fold. However, the large thrust faults which have undertaken long developing history, have the potential of occurring of strong earthquake. The distribution of high intensity areas of history earthquakes were consisted with the surface ruptures appeared along the front thrust faults. In this case, these front thrust fault-fold should be ascertained as the potential seismic source of strong earthquake. The new developed thrust fault-folds in basin region have possibility of earthquake MS6.5—7.0, which should be ascertained as the potential seismic source with upper limit magnitude of MS7.0. The deep structure and the relationship between deep and shallow structures were still not well studied and understood in the thrust fault-fold regions of Xinjiang. The uncertainty of occurrence model of strong earthquake in the thrust fault-fold region, as well as the parameters of historic seismicity and tectonic activity should be considered during the ascertainment of potential seismic source.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The effects of random anisotropy on the magnetic transition and magnetic entropy change (MEC) have been investigated in a series of Gd-Er-Al-Co metallic glasses(MGs) through Er addition. The Gd-based metallic glass without Er shows typical ferromagnetic transition. With Er addition, the Curie temperature decreases and a re-entrant spin glass like behavior can be observed due to the frustration among random magnetic anisotropy (RMA) and exchange interactions. A large maximum MEC of 9.1 J kg −1  K −1  around 117.5 K is obtained in Gd 56 Co 24 Al 20  MG, which can be tuned continuously in a wide temperature range (117.5–17.5 K) by introducing Er without impairing the good glass forming ability. A largest peak MEC of 12.6 J kg −1  K −1  has been obtained around 17.5 K in Gd 8 Er 48 Co 24 Al 20 . Significantly, the exponent  n  of field dependence of MEC is found to depend on the degree of magnetic frustration among RMA and exchange interactions.",

Therefore, mining gene expression data is currently an urgent research question, for detecting a corresponding pattern, such as cancer species, quickly and accurately. Since gene expression data classification problem has been widely studied accompanying with the development of gene technology, by far numerous methods, mainly neural network related, have been deployed in medical data analysis, which is mainly dealing with the high dimension and small quantity. A lot of research has been conducted on clustering approaches, extreme learning machine and so on. They are usually applied in a shallow neural network model. Recently deep learning has shown its power and good performance on high dimensional datasets. Unlike current popular deep neural network, we will continue to apply shallow neural network but develop an innovative algorithm for shallow neural network. In the supervised model, we demonstrate a shallow neural network model with a batch of parameters, and narrow its computational process into several positive parts, which process smoothly for a better result and finally achieve an optimal goal. It shows a stable and excellent result comparable to deep neural network. An analysis of the algorithm is also presented in this paper.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A pre-cold-deformation process was applied for commercially pure titanium at cryogenic temperature to activate high-density deformation twins, and subsequent hot-deformation was used to induce dynamic recrystallization (DRX). Three major types of twins were effectively activated during cryogenic deformation, including     {  11    2  ¯    2  }     contraction twins,     {  11    2  ¯    1  }     extension twins, and     {  10    1  ¯    2  }     extension twins. A special type of slipped     {  11    2  ¯    1  }     “twins” was also activated by a sequential effect of twinning and slip. Selection of twinning variants followed Schmidu0027s law well, where only the twinning systems with a Schmid factor of  m  ≥ 0.4 could be activated. The pre-activated twinning led to a remarkably stable flow stress at 500 °C up to a true strain of 1.0, due to the attainment of dynamic equilibrium between strain hardening and high-temperature softening. Two DRX stages occurred: (1) twin-active DRX stage, and (2) discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX) stage. The DRX mechanisms identified were twinning-induced DRX (or TDRX) and DDRX. While the low-temperature slip alone had little influence on DRX, the pre-activated     {  11    2  ¯    2  }     twins,        {  11    2  ¯    1  }      twins,     {  10    1  ¯    2  }     twins and slipped     {  11    2  ¯    1  }     “twins” contributed effectively to DRX in the form of spheroidization of twin lamellae due to twin-dislocation interactions, leading to a substantial grain refinement from ∼41 to ∼1 μm during subsequent hot-deformation.",

By applying the Bayesian law to the state and measurement equations of the stochastic system, the a posteriori density is obtained in closed-form and computed recursively for arbitrary i.i.d. state noise and any discrete-type measurement noise (or multilevel digital signal). Then, our effort concentrates on the estimation of impulsive noise which interferes the multilevel signal of interest. By considering the Lp -metric performance criterion, where 0<p<2, the corresponding estimators are obtained. Using a new damping function scheme, the performance of the new estimators is improved even further.

        "abstract": "Boiling heat transfer exists in many industrial heat exchangerssuch as the evaporator of the refrigerator and the air conditioner,the reboiler of the chemical equipment and steam generator of thenuclear reactor. In the process of boiling, bubble movement can speedup the heat transfer between liquid and solid, leading to the improvementin heat transfer efficiency. Traditional refrigerants used in theindustrial facilities have serious environmental problems, therefore,new substitutes are needed. Hydrocarbons are good alternatives. Ethanewas suggested as one component of a mixed- refrigerant for its zeroozone depletion potential, low global warming potential and high thermodynamicproperties. Therefore, it is important to investigate the bubble behaviorof ethane in saturated nucleate pool boiling to design and optimizethe industrial equipment like evaporator, improve natural gas liquefactiontechnology, and research characteristics of heat transfer and multiphaseflow as well. Although there are a lot of researches on the heat transfercharacteristics of pool boiling, the research on the bubble behaviorin ethane is still lacking. In this paper, visualization experimentson the pool boiling heat transfer characteristics of ethane were carriedout at 0.2 MPa. The heat fluxes varied from 14.65 kW m −2  to 80.79 kW m −2 .Boiling occurred on the upward facing side of a smooth vertical coppercylinder with 20 mm diameter, connected to a DC power supplyto control the heat flux on the surface. The measured roughness ofthe surface was 68.1 nm (root mean square average of the heightdeviations) and 50.7 nm (the arithmetic average of the absolutevalues of the surface height deviations). Acquisition of the temperatureand pressure was accomplished by using a Keithley 2700 and six thermocouples.The experimental apparatus has a steel ruler inside the pool as thereference length to measure the bubble sizes and the maximum uncertaintyfor length measurement is 0.060 mm. Some conclusions can bedrawn. (1) According to the change of diameter with time, the growthprocess was divided into three stages. The bubble growth process hasobvious segmentation characteristics, and piecewise prediction modelsare recommended. (2) The bubbles in boiling pool exhibit the characteristicsof axial symmetry and uneven distribution; the shape of separationof ethane bubbles has ellipsoidal and irregular shapes relative tonormal temperature liquids. (3) There were trail changes and additionalmovements of large bubbles. Compared to normal temperature liquids,the trail changes were relatively simple; and the bubbles are bubblyand slug flow of two flow regimes. (4) System pressure, heating wallproperties like surface roughness, liquid properties like contactangle and surface tension have an important influence on bubble behavior.This paper suggests that the heat transfer prediction equation shouldconsider them.",

        "title": "Carbon fiber on polyimide ultra-microelectrodes.",
        "abstract": ". Most preparations for making neural recordings degrade over time and eventually fail due to insertion trauma and reactive tissue response. The magnitudes of these responses are thought to be related to the electrode size (specifically, the cross-sectional area), the relative stiffness of the electrode, and the degree of tissue tolerance for the material. Flexible carbon fiber ultra-microelectrodes have a much smaller cross-section than traditional electrodes and low tissue reactivity, and thus may enable improved longevity of neural recordings in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Only two carbon fiber array designs have been described previously, each with limited channel densities due to limitations of the fabrication processes or interconnect strategies. Here, we describe a method for assembling carbon fiber electrodes on a flexible polyimide substrate that is expected to facilitate the construction of high-density recording and stimulating arrays. . Individual carbon fibers were aligned using an alignment tool that was 3D-printed with sub-micron resolution using direct laser writing. Indium deposition on the carbon fibers, followed by low-temperature microsoldering, provided a robust and reliable method of electrical connection to the polyimide interconnect. . Spontaneous multiunit activity and stimulation-evoked compound responses with SNR > 10 and > 120, respectively, were recorded from a small (125 µm) peripheral nerve. We also improved the typically poor charge injection capacity of small diameter carbon fibers by electrodepositing 100 nm thick iridium oxide films, making the carbon fiber arrays usable for electrical stimulation as well as recording. . Our innovations in fabrication technique pave the way for further miniaturization of carbon fiber ultra-microelectrode arrays. We believe these advances to be key steps to enable a shift from labor intensive, manual assembly to a more automated manufacturing process.",

        "abstract": "With the development of Internet-based technologies and the rapid growth of scientific computing applications, Grid computing becomes more and more attractive. Generally, the execution time of a CPU-intensive task on a certain resource is tightly related to the CPU load on this resource. In order to estimate the task execution time more accurately to achieve an effective task scheduling, it is significant to make an effective long-term load prediction in dynamic Grid environments. Nevertheless, as the prediction errors will be gradually accumulated while the best values of prediction parameters may vary vigorously, the existing prediction algorithms usually fail to achieve good prediction accuracy in the long-term prediction. To address these problems, an effective Data Aggregation based Adaptive Long term resource load Point-Prediction mechanism (DA^2LP\"P\"o\"i\"n\"t) is proposed in this paper, where a data aggregation concept is introduced herein to reduce the number of prediction step. Furthermore, an interval based prediction mechanism with probability distribution representation called DA^2LP\"I\"n\"t\"e\"r\"v\"a\"l is lately proposed to improve the adaptation of prediction results. The experimental results show that the DA^2LP\"P\"o\"i\"n\"t algorithm can outperform previous prediction methods in regard to mean square error (MSE). In addition, the DA^2LP\"I\"n\"t\"e\"r\"v\"a\"l algorithm can attain lesser prediction error with stronger representation capability; therefore, it is able to provide much more useful information for task scheduling in Grid environments.",

Although the magnetic entropy change decreases with increasing Co concentration, the hysteresis loss at TC also reduces remarkably from 94.8 Jkg for x=0 to 1.8 Jkg for x=0.4 because an increase in Co content can weaken the itinerant electron metamagnetic transition. The effective refrigerant capacity remains at a high value ranging from 355 to 433 Jkg for a field change of 0-5 T as x varies from 0 to 1.0. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes that reside within the epithelium of the intestine form one of the main branches of the immune system. A majority of IELs express CD8α homodimer together with other molecules associated with immune regulation. Growing evidence points to the WNT signaling pathway as a pivotal piece in the immune balance and focuses on its direct regulation in intestinal epithelium. Therefore we decided to investigate its role in IELs’ immune status determination. Method DSS colitis was induced in male C57BL mice. IELs were isolated from colon samples using mechanical dissociation followed by percoll gradient purification and Magnetic-activated cell sorting. Phenotype and cytokine production and condition with Wnts were analyzed by flow cytometry, real-time PCR or ELISA. Proliferation of lymphocytes were evaluated using CFSE dilution. Cell responses after WNT pathway interference were also evaluated. Results Non-canonical WNT pathway elements represented by FZD5, WNT5A and NFATc1 were remarkably elevated in colitis IELs. The non-canonical WNT5A skewed them into a pro-inflammatory category as measured by inhibitory cell surface marker LAG3, LY49E, NKG2A and activated marker CD69 and FASL. Gaining of a pro-inflammatory marker was correlated with increased IFN-γ production but not TNF whilst decreased TGF-β and IL-10. Both interrupting WNT5A/PKC pathway and adding canonical WNT stimulants could curtail its immune-activating effect. Conclusion Canonical and non-canonical WNT signals act in opposing manners concerning determining CD8αα+ IELs immune status. Targeting non-canonical WNT pathway may be promising in tackling inflammatory bowel disease.",

The experimental results show that all of the characteristic temperatures including glass transition temperature Tg, onset crystallization temperature T x, peak temperatures Tp1 and Tp2, and the supercooled liquid region ΔTx, increase to some extent. T x can be augmented remarkably when the Sn addition is 3%, which may be attributed to the suppression of the first stage of the crystallization, and therefore, the supercooled liquid region is largely widened. Consequently, the thermal stability of the Z52.5Ti5 Al10Ni 14.6Cu17.9 bulk metallic glass can be increased by the introduction of Sn. Enhancing the complexity of the components of some bulk metallic glasses is a useful method to improve their thermal stabilities.",

        "abstract": "MgAl 2 O 4 ceramic pellets have been investigated as the in situ humidity sensing elements for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. The MgAl 2 O 4 powder was synthesized through EDTA-citrates method. When the temperature increased from 50 °C to 80 °C, the ohmic resistance ( R ) at the whole relative humidity (RH) range decreased by about one order of magnitude while the linearity of Log( R ) vs. RH remained constant. The MgAl 2 O 4 specimens sintered at 1200 °C with ball-milled powder show the highest humidity sensitivity with 3.3 orders of magnitude change from RH 40% to RH 100%. Homogenous meso-pore (around 50 nm) might be the root cause for high sensitivity and the macro-pore (>50 nm) is the cause for decreasing the sensitivity of the sensing material. A precise optimization criterion for pore size has been proposed for this RH range. The MgAl 2 O 4 -based ceramic pellets show promising performance for the in situ RH sensing for PEM fuel cells. Keywords Humidity sensor MgAl 2 O 4 spinel Pore size distribution Mean free path Kelvin equation PEM fuel cells 1 Introduction Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells have attracted tremendous research and development efforts in recent years as environmentally friendly and highly efficient electricity-generating devices. Humidity conditions around a membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) can strongly affect the performance of PEM fuel cells. When MEA works at low humidity, ionic resistance would increase and cause high ohmic voltage loss and in turn reduced cell performance. Increasing relative humidity (RH) of feeding gas can enhance ionic conductivity in membrane and catalyst layers. However, too much water can lead to local water flooding affecting gas transport and distribution, which makes the cell performance worsen significantly [1] . Therefore, in practice, reactant gases need to be suitably humidified to maintain a well-hydrated membrane under the balance of keeping sufficient hydration and preventing flooding. So far, the measurement of water content under PEM fuel cell environment in a cost-effective and accurate manner is still a developing technology. Good sensitivity at high humidity level (>80%) is critical for the application in real operating condition of PEM fuel cells. Few studies have been conducted in this area to measure or monitor the humidity of fuel cells [2–5] . However, most commercial humidity sensors in the market cannot work properly in whole humidity range, especially at high humidity level. It is of high importance to develop a suitable sensing material for the application in typical operating conditions for PEM fuel cells. MgAl 2 O 4 is widely used as sensing material to monitor humidity both in industry and residential applications because of its accuracy, repeatability, and long-term stability. In humid environment, the chemisorbed water in crystal grains dissociates into OH − in the first adsorbed layer. In subsequent physical adsorption, the high electrostatic fields of OH − will produce H 3 O + , which leads to an increase of surface conduction [6] . The humidity sensitive characteristic of MgAl 2 O 4 is related to its microstructural properties, such as thickness, surface area, porosity and pore size distribution [7–8] . In this investigation, the developed MgAl 2 O 4 sensing materials were specially designed, characterized and optimized for the application in typical operating conditions for PEM fuel cells, i.e. 50–80 °C and 40–100% RH range. The mechanism of vapor adsorption and condensation will be also discussed. A precise optimization criterion for pore size was also proposed for this RH range based on the experimental results and theoretical modelling. Homogenous meso-pore (around 50 nm) is found to be the root cause for high sensitivity and the macro-pore (>50 nm) is the cause for decreasing the sensitivity of the sensing material. 2 Experimental 2.1 MgAl 2 O 4 pellets preparation MgAl 2 O 4 powder was synthesized via ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-citrates method with Mg(CH 3 COO) 2 ·4H 2 O and Al(NO 3 ) 3 ·9H 2 O as starting materials. The starting salts were dissolved with EDTA and citric acid as mixed chelator and pH value of the solution was kept at about 6–7. After solution condensation at around 80 °C, the gel was ignited and then self-combusted. Raw powder was obtained after calcination at 800 °C for 4 h in air. The powder was also ball-milled in order to control the pore structure. The synthesis route is shown in Fig. 1 . The raw powder and ball-milled powder were pressed into pellets under uni-axial pressure of 50 MPa and then the pellets obtained were sintered at different temperatures. The diameters of the sintered pellet are around 13 mm and the thickness is about 3 mm. 2.2 Microstructure Phase identification of these pellets was carried out on an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) with a Cu tube and a nickel filter. The microstructure of the sensor pellets was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-3500N). Pore size distribution (PSD) of the sensor pellets was measured by an Auto Pore IV 9500 porosimeter (Micrometrics, USA). The applied pressure was up to 228 MPa, which corresponded to a pore size ranging from 3 nm to 300 μm in diameter. The method is based on the capillary law governing liquid penetration into small pores. In the case of a non-wetting liquid, such as mercury, assuming that all pores are cylindrical in shape, the relation of pore diameter and pressure can be described by Washburn Equation: (1) D = − 4 γ Hg cos   θ P where D is the pore diameter, P is the applied pressure, γ Hg is the surface tension, and θ is the contact angle. The value of γ Hg and θ adopted here are 485 dyn cm −1 and 130°, respectively [9] . 2.3 Humidity sensitivity measurements Platinum electrodes were painted on both sides of the pellets to improve the reliability of resistance measurement. Then the samples were sandwiched between two metal meshes and then inserted in a testing tube with which the temperature and humidity controller were mounted. The temperature varied from 50 °C to 80 °C and the gas humidity was adjusted in the range from 40% to 100% with flow rate of 100 L min −1 controlled by a testing station (Green Light Power Technologies). The ohmic resistances of the ceramic pellets were measured using an Agilent 34401A multimeter interfaced to a computer. 3 Results and discussion The preparation conditions for the three samples are summarized in Table 1 . Pellets of Sample A and Sample B are prepared using the raw powder and sintered at 1450 °C for 4 h and 1000 °C for 2 h, respectively. Pellet of Sample C is prepared using the ball-milled powder and then sintered at 1200 °C for 2 h. The heating and cooling rate and dwell time during the sintering are 3 °C min −1 and 2 h, respectively. Fig. 2 gives the XRD patterns of MgAl 2 O 4 pellets before and after humidity sensitivity test. From the peak positions and their relative intensities, it can be distinguished that cubic MgAl 2 O 4 spinel phase is identified for each pellet [8] . No impurity or secondary phase could be found in these XRD patterns. The phase structure is stable after being humidified under different relative humidity values. Fig. 3 gives the SEM images of the three samples. Owing to the aggregation in the raw powder, Sample A and Sample B are porous and each contains a considerable amount of large pores in micron scale. On the contrary, Sample C made from ball-milled powder is much denser. Ball milling destroys large pores in the powder aggregates and the subsequent pressing and sintering steps made a compact and homogenous microstructure. Pore size distribution is further investigated using mercury porosimetry. Fig. 4 shows the pore size distribution (PSD) curves of the three samples. The PSD curve of Sample A shows a broad peak corresponding to a pore size ranging from 100 nm to 1 μm. Sample B gives an even broader peak with wide pore size distribution from 20 nm to 2 μm. Sample B mainly possessed two parts of pore structure. One is meso-pore from 30 nm to 50 nm, and the other is macro-pore with pore size ranging from 50 nm to 2 μm, which could be attributed to the lower sintering temperature of 1000 °C. There are mainly meso-pores (20–70 nm) in Sample C and the total pore volume is much smaller than those of Sample A and Sample B, which is consistent with the SEM results. It is indicated that the ball-milled process and the subsequent sintering step are the main parameters to control the pore structure. In most cases, humidity sensitivities were tested between 30 °C and 40 °C and wide RH range for domestic application [9] . To simulate the operation environment of PEM fuel cells, the samples were tested at the typical operating temperature range of 50–80 °C and typical RH range of 40–100%. Fig. 5 shows the humidity sensitivity behavior of Sample A in term of resistance variation as a function of temperature and relative humidity. The ohmic resistances of the sensor decrease with increasing temperature due to higher vapor content and thermal activation of ionic conductivity. Within the whole temperature range of 50–80 °C, the slope of Log( R ) vs. RH is almost constant. Therefore, MgAl 2 O 4 sensing material is effective as a humidity sensor for the entire temperature range. Fig. 6 shows the humidity sensitivity of the three samples at 80 °C. The ohmic resistance of Sample A decreases by 1.3 orders of magnitude as the RH changes from 40% to 100% while Sample B decreases by 1 order of magnitude. The corresponding decrease of ohmic resistance for Sample C is 3.3 orders of magnitude, which suggest that Sample C be much more sensitive to humidity change than other samples. This value is comparable with the previously reported value of about 2.2 orders of magnitude with one pot synthesized MgAl 2 O 4 as RH changed from 40% to 90% [8] . More importantly, the curves of Log( R ) vs. RH are linear even at RH levels above 80%, which would be very important for the application in PEM fuel cells. For a porous ceramic sensor, chemical adsorption, physical adsorption and capillary condensation determine the change of electrical properties. Once the dry oxide is in contact with humid air, water molecules will irreversibly adsorb on the defect sites of the oxide surface. At low RH levels, single or few water layers are physically adsorbed on the inner surface of ceramic pores. The amount of adsorbed water is closely related to the surface area and pore size distribution of the ceramic sensor. The higher the surface area, the more water is adsorbed, and therefore the lower the resistance. In order to improve the humidity sensitivity, the resistance at low RH levels should be as high as possible. Therefore, high surface area is not favored for humidity sensitivity. In our experiment, Sample B was sintered at the lowest temperature of 1000 °C, leaving the largest surface area. The resistances of Sample B at low RH levels are much lower than those of Sample A and Sample C. With increasing RH level, multi-layer physical adsorption of water molecules would occur in ceramic pores. The water content on inner surface depends not only on surface area, but also on pore size and operation condition. Mean free path (MFP) of the water molecules, the average distance of a water molecular traveling between collisions with other molecules or inner surface of ceramic pore, is an important factor relating to the diffusion of gas in ceramic pores and the phenomena of multi-layer physical adsorption. Assuming λ w as MFP and D as pore size, when λ w ≥ 10 D , Knudson diffusion takes place with water molecules mainly colliding with the pore wall rather than other gas molecules. When λ w ≤ 0.01 D , free diffusion is predominant, which is similar to the diffusion in an infinite space. In the transitional region of 10 D ≤ λ w ≤ 0.01 D , both types of diffusion take place in parallel. According to Maxwell's equation [10] , MFP of a gas component in a gas mixture follows: (2) λ a = 1 π ∑ x = a s n x ( r x + r a ) 2 1 + m a / m x where x = a , b , c , …, s are the gas components in the mixture; λ a the MFP of component a ; n x the molecular density of component x ; r the radius; and m is the molecule weight. Based on Eq. (2) , MFP of water vapor molecule in air (as carrier gas) can be calculated as follows: (3) λ w = 1 π { 2 n w ( 2 r w ) 2 + n n ( r n + r w ) 2 1 + m w / m n + n o ( r o + r w ) 2 1 + m w / m o + n Ar ( r Ar + r w ) 2 1 + m w / m Ar } where λ w is the mean free path of water, D is the pore diameter, n w , n n , n o and n Ar are the molecular density of water, nitrogen, oxygen and argon, respectively, r w , r n , r o and r Ar are the molecular radii of water, nitrogen, oxygen and argon, respectively and m w , m n , m o and m Ar are the molecule weight of water, nitrogen, oxygen and argon, respectively. In Eq. (3) , the molecular radii can also be found from Ref. [10] and the molecular density of x component ( n x ) can be calculated with: (4) n x = P x × N R T where P x is the partial pressure of component x , N is Avogadro constant, 6.023 × 10 23 , R is the universal gas constant, 8.314 J mol −1 K −1 , T is the thermodynamic temperature, K. Fig. 7 gives the calculation results of mean free path at different temperatures and RH levels. Most MFP values are between 90 nm and 100 nm with an average value of 94 nm. The slope of MFP vs. RH gets larger at higher temperature due to the increase of saturation vapor pressure. For Sample A and Sample B, λ w / D ≈ 0.3 while λ w / D ≈ 1.8 for Sample C, in the transitional region of 10 D ≤ λ w ≤ 0.01 D . So in all the samples, the collision of vapor molecules with the pore wall and gas molecules are both significant. Due to higher λ w / D in Sample C, the collision between the vapor molecules and the pore wall is more prevailing than that in Sample A and B. Thicker water film is more likely to originate on the pore wall of Sample C than that of Sample A and B, which results in a dramatic decrease of the resistance when RH increases. With further increase of RH up to near saturation, water condensation would become crucial for the humidity sensitivity. Meso-pores may be all filled with water because of capillary condensation. The quantity of condensed water depends on the open pore size and the RH values. The pore radius at which capillary condensation occurs at a given temperature and RH level can be calculated by the Kelvin equation [6] : (5) r k = − 2 γ w M w ρ R T   ln ( R H ) where r k is the Kelvin radius, γ w is the surface tension of water, M w is the molecular weight of water, ρ is the water density, R is the universal gas constant, 8.314 J mol −1 K −1 , and T is the thermodynamic temperature, K. The vapor condensation will take place in all the pores with pore radius up to the Kelvin radius r k . Once the pores with the same radius are filled with liquid water, the filling status and conduction behavior in these pores will remain constant when RH increases further. For the pores larger than the critical pore size of 2 r k , the smaller the pore size, the larger the volume fraction of the condensed water in the pores, which means a lower resistance. Fig. 8 shows the critical pore sizes calculated according to Kelvin equation. The critical pore size increases from several nanometers to about 30–35 nm as RH increases from 40% to 95%. With saturated vapor, condensation might take place at all the pores no matter how big the pore is. According to the PSD curve of Fig. 4 , the pore sizes of Sample A and Sample B are obviously larger than the critical pore sizes in most RH levels. Thus, capillary condensation does not take place in the two samples except for the saturated condition. In Sample C, capillary condensation would occur gradually from small pores to large ones when RH increases to above 90%. The sensor resistance would decrease gradually when liquid water fills more and more pores. From the above discussion, the optimal pore size for humidity sensitivity for the application in PEM fuel cells might be just higher than the critical pore size for capillary condensation. Therefore, the optimal pore size at high relative humidity levels might be 50–100 nm. Micro-pores are sensitive at medium to low RH range (RH < 50%) but are easily filled by liquid water at higher RH and therefore lose their sensitivity of humidity. Macro-pores result in the decrease of collisions between vapor molecules and the pore wall; therefore the sensitivity is lost. The knowledge of determination of pore size is in favor of the selection and preparation of ceramic sensing materials. The humidity sensitivity of ceramic sensors could be adjusted by controlling its pore size distribution and surface area and therefore sensing material with special property could be designed for special humidity environments. Fig. 9 gives the sensitivity repeatability of the Sample C for 10 cycles. The MgAl 2 O 4 materials show excellent repeatability of humidity sensitivity. 4 Conclusion Microstructure and humidity sensitive characteristic of MgAl 2 O 4 ceramic sensors were studied under the simulated PEM fuel cell operating conditions. The humidity sensitivity of MgAl 2 O 4 ceramic sensors depends on their bulk properties like pore size and surface area, which can be controlled through ceramic sintering temperature and fabrication process. The sensor made from MgAl 2 O 4 ceramic ball-milled powder and sintered at the medium temperature showed a high sensitivity and good repeatability in the humid environment with 40–100% relative humidity. Therefore, the MgAl 2 O 4 sensing material described here shows promising performance as a sensitive diagnosis tool over the humidity variation for PEM fuel cells. A real tiny-chip sensor array with sensing elements for temperature H 2 S, humidity, CO and CO 2 will be constructed partially based on the knowledge from this investigation for in situ application in fuel cell environment.

        "abstract": "Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and other major cooperative groups endorse the consensus guidelines for the delineation of the node levels in stage N0 cases. But it is unclear if these guidelines can be extrapolated to N+ cases. This study was to explore the value of RTOG guidelines in delineating cervical target volumes for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with lymph node metastasis.Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the nasopharynx, including plain and contrast enhanced sequences, was performed on 254 naive NPC patients. The lymph nodes were divided into six cervical levels plus retropharyngeal nodes (RN) according to RTOG guidelines proposed in 2003.Anatomic boundaries of node levels were observed clearly on MRI. Of the 254 patients, 107 (42.1%) had obvious lymph node necrosis, 78 (30.7%) had extracapsular nodal spread, four (1.6%) had skipped metastasis. The levels of lymph node metastases in 51 (20.1%) patients were beyond RTOG guidelines, 42 of which were above cranial level IIb, six were behind the anterior edge of the trapezius muscle, and 23 were below the caudal of level IV; 20 patients had two regions of lymph node metastases beyond RTOG guidelines. No patient only with lymph node metastasis beyond RTOG guidelines was found.MRI is feasible to diagnose cervical node metastasis with RTOG guidelines. The boundaries of node levels should be enlarged rationally when delineating target volumes for the N+ NPC patients according to RTOG guidelines.",

Two patients had a history of radiotherapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.MSCT examinations were performed and imaging features were retrospectively analyzed. Results Among these ten patients,lesions were located in mandible in five patients and maxilla in 5 patients.The lesions demonstrated osteolytic changes in three cases and osteogenesis in four cases and mixed changes in three cases.The periosteum of all the four cases of osteosarcoma osteogenesis showed the sunburst appearance.Irregularity and lamellar tumor bones were seen in seven cases.The lesions of all the ten patients extended into the adjacent soft tissue and manifested as a comparatively large soft tissue mass.All lesions showed obviously heterogeneous enhancement. MSCT with the help of 3D reformatting techniques can exactly show the bone destruction and anatomical relation with surrounding tissues.Conclusion MSCT can directly and exactly show the details of osteosarcoma of jaw by means of using different 3D image reformatting technique.",

        "abstract": "The Ni-based superalloy DZ125 was prepared by liquid metal cooling (LMC) directional solidification and quenching technology with withdrawal rate (V) range of 2-400 μm/s and temperature gradient up to 250 K/cm. The morphologies of solid/liquid (S/L) interface, cellular/dendritic arm spacings and the morphologies of MC carbide were studied systematically. The shallow cellular interface arised at V=2 μm/s. With increasing the withdrawal rate, the S/L interface turns into deep cellular (V=3 μm/s) and dendritic (V ≥5 μm/s) interfaces successively. The cellular spacing is increased with increasing the withdrawal rate. However, the primary dendritic arm spacing is decreased with increasing the withdrawal rate. The maximum value of cellular/dendritic spacings appears at transition from cellular to dendritic interfaces (V=5 μm/s). Meanwhile, the morphology of MC carbide changes from octahedron to frame-like, Chinese-script and finally to fine dendrite with increasing the withdrawal rate. Compared with the theoretical models of primary dendrite spacing, the results are good in agreement with Trivedi's and Ma's models. Furthermore, they are also in agreement with Hunt-Lu model only at lower withdrawal rates (V ≤ 50 μm/s). The relationships of primary and secondary dendritic arm spacings with withdrawal rates can be described as λ 1=314.6V -0.24±0.02 and λ 2=97.76V -0.33±0.01, respectively. MC carbide precipitated from the melt during solidification, and its morphology is dependent both on the withdrawal rate and the morphology of S/L interface. © Copyright.",

        "abstract": "To determine the role of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and quantitative T2 value measurements in the assessment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).Sequential MR imaging, T2 measurement, and quantitative sensory testing of sciatic nerves were performed in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (n = 6) and normal control rats (n = 6) over a 7-week follow-up period. Histological assessment was obtained from 48 diabetic rats and 48 control rats once weekly for 7 weeks (n = 6 for each group at each time point). Nerve signal abnormalities were observed, and the T2 values, mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT), and histological changes were measured and compared between diabetic and control animals.Sciatic nerves in the diabetic rats showed a gradual increase in T2 values beginning at 2 weeks after the induction (P = 0.014), while a decrease in MWT started at 3 weeks after the induction (P = 0.001). Nerve T2 values had a similar time course to sensory functional deficit in diabetic rats. Histologically, sciatic nerves of diabetic rats demonstrated obvious endoneural oedema from 2 to 3 weeks after the induction, followed by progressive axonal degeneration, Schwann cell proliferation, and coexistent disarranged nerve regeneration.Nerve T2 measurement is potentially useful in detecting and monitoring diabetic neuropathy.• Sciatic nerves in diabetic rats showed a gradual increase in T2 values • Nerve T2 values were negatively correlated with sensory function impairment • Longitudinal T2 values can be used to monitor the disease progress • Nerve degeneration contributed mainly to progressive prolongation of nerve T2 values.",

        "abstract": "The critical temperature (Tc) and boiling temperature (Tb) of working fluids are important selection criteria for the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system. In this study, the ratio of Tb and Tc (Tbr) and the vapor expansion ratio (VER) model based on Claussius–Claperyron equation are introduced to compare and explain their effects on the maximum net output power (Wnet,max) and VER of ORC. The investigation of 267 working fluids is done at four heat source temperatures (T5). Maximum vapor enthalpy method is proposed to determine the upper limit of the evaporation temperature, which is the optimization parameter for maximizing the net power output. At low T5 (423.15 and 473.15 K), the obvious relationships between Wnet,max and Tc are independent of Tbr. Therefore, Tc enables to select working fluids with high Wnet,max. However, at high T5 (523.15 and 573.15 K), Tbr is essential to exclude working fluids with optimum Tc (0.89 – 0.90T5) but low Wnet,max. Moreover, at a given Tc, high Tb or Tbr indicates high VER. Consequently, Tb or Tbr is suitable to be used as the second indicator. This paper proposes the optimal combinations of Tc and Tb and the developed composite indicator for selection of working fluids.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the comprehensive measures for improving radical resection rate and safety of Bismuth-Corlette type III hilar cholangiocarcinoma.The clinical data of 15 patients with Bismuth-Corlette type III hilar cholangiocarcinoma who performed radical resection from June 2009 to December 2011 was analyzed retrospectively. There were 11 male and 4 female patients, aged from 45 to 74 years (mean 59 years). The preoperative evaluation were conducted by using magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), dual source spiral CT combined with IQQA-Liver CT Imaging Analysis System providing three-dimensional reconstruction of tumor, bile duct, hepatic artery and portal vein, which could help to chose the appropriate treatment modality. All patients were treated with selective hemi-hepatic vascular control of removal liver, hemi-hepatectomy combined with whole caudate lobe resection and regional lymphadenectomy. The merits of each evaluation methods and measures of surgical treatment were analyzed thoroughly.The preoperative evaluation modalities including the dual source spiral CT combined with IQQA-Liver CT Imaging Analysis System could clearly show the involvement of bile duct, hepatic artery and portal vein invaded by the tumor. The satisfactory postoperative recovery could be achieved by the remnant liver volume of > 40% after the hemi-hepatectomy combined with whole caudate lobe resection through the selective preoperative biliary drainage and hemihepatic vascular control. The mean complication was transient aggravated liver dysfunction. There was no death reported during perioperative period in the group.The preoperative imaging evaluation modalities including MRCP, dual source spiral CT combined with IQQA-Liver CT Imaging Analysis System could do favor for the preoperative evaluation of invasion degree of hilar cholangiocarcinoma and the selection of appropriate surgical treatment. Hemi-hepatectomy combined with whole caudate lobe resection and regional lymphadenectomy could be an alternative management of Bismuth-Corlette type III hilar cholangiocarcinoma.",

It was also aimed to probe the functions of the iodized salt complement with the dietary iodine intake, and whether the urine iodine could reflect dietary iodine intake.278 food samples in markets were collected by a randomly stratified sampling method, while the arsenic-cerium catalytic contact method was used to determine the content in food. The dietary information of students for seven days was recorded, and the urine iodine was determined through the arsenic-cerium catalytic spectrophotometry.The determination of 47 kinds and 278 food samples indicated that the content of iodine within animal foods (7.8 microg/100 g - 30.8 microg/100 g) was higher than that within plant foods (1.8 microg/100 g - 16.1 microg/100 g). The investigation also showed that students who regarded vegetarian food as principle accounted for 70. 19%. The amount of dietary iodine intake among those students, based on the dietary survey, was (111.67 +/- 53.18) microg/d, while supplementary iodine from iodized salt was about (230.27 +/- 45.55) microg/d. Therefore, the total iodine provided from diet would be (341.95 +/- 89.58) microg/d. Modified by urine creatinine, the median of urine iodine was 271.28 microg/gCr, and the urine iodine and dietary iodine intake was found positively related (r(s) = 0.463, P < 0.01).Regarding the vegetarian food as the principle, most of students investigated are not rich. The dietary iodine intake is lower than RDA (150 microg), but it can be obtained the iodized salt by 230. 27 microg, which is the possible supplement to the shortage from foods.",

        "abstract": "The M_ S 6.8 Bachu-Jiashi earthquake of Feb.24, 2003 occurred in the western Tarim Basin and is possibly the continuation of the Jiashi strong earthquake swarms in 1997—1998. However, its focal mechanism and rupture process are different from that of the Jiashi strong earthquake swarms, according to our preliminary study on its seismic tectonics with geomorphologic information from satellite images, the deep structures from the petroleum seismic exploration, the macro damage and isoseismic features from field investigation, the relocation of the epicenters of the aftershocks, and the regional seismic tectonics from both deep and surface tectonics. The occurrence of the M_ S 6.8 Bachu-Jiashi earthquake is closely related with the revealed reverse fault on the Maigaiti slope belt between the Bachu uplift and Kashi depression in western Tarim Basin. The sites of the ground fissures found in the field fit with the revealed reverse fault. Isoseismal features are also corresponding to the rupture direction of the fault. These evidences indicate that the M_ S 6.8 Bachu-Jiashi earthquake is the result of the southward rupturing from deep to shallow along a north-dipping reverse fault in Tarim Basin. This reverse fault is possibly the result of the propagation of the thrust fault-fold system named Kalpintag thrust belt in the front of Tianshan.",

These broadening intensity curves are identical with the results measured by an x-ray diffractometer on these liquid metals. The present results indicate that the nanocrystal model may be helpful to understand the microstructures of liquid metals and that there is a close correlation between the short-range orders (SROs) of these liquid metals and some crystal lattice structures. That is, the SRO structures of liquid Cu, Al and Al 65Cu 20Fe 15 alloy are fcc, bcc and icosahedron, respectively.",

The microstructures at different solidified fractions were examined by OM and SEM. The results showed that the solid/liquid interface is planar and the microstructure evolution undergoes three stages: the γ phase was formed as solidified fraction (f s) was below 0.26, and the fine HfC phase sparsely distributed in γ matrix; the coupled γ/MC growth appeared as f s ranged from 0.26 to 0.86, and the morphology of MC was fibrous or plate-like shapes; the γ/γ eutectic was obtained as f s was more than and equaled 0.86 0.86, in which the octahedral MC was precipitated simultaneously. EPMA was used to determine the solute distribution along the longitudinal direction of the sample. The contents of Al, Ti, Ta and Mo increased with f s increasing, while the contents of W, Cr and Co decreased. The analysis showed that the microstructure transformation is attributed to macro-scale non-uniform solute distribution which resulted from solute redistribution during directional solidification. © Copyright.",

        "abstract": "To study the influence and distribution in proximal tubule epithelial cells with the expressions of CD133 and CD34 in a rat model so as to provide a study basis for renal adult stem cell.The kidney ischemia/reperfusion model was established by blocking the bilateral renal arteries for about 50 min and recovering the renal perfusion of blood. Then the rat kidneys were extracted at Days 3, 5 and 7 post-modeling. After a series of special treatment, immunohistochemical staining was used to show the distribution and expression intensity of KIM-1, Brdu antigen, CD34 and CD133 antigens in cells with the elapsing of time.As compared with control group, the KIM-1 and CD133 antigens were present in cortex renis while the CD34 and Brdu antigens were distributed in parts of medulla renis and juncture of cortex-medulla renis. The expression density value of KIM-1 and CD133 antigens rose for the first 3 days then declined afterward (40.3% ± 3.2%, 57.5% ± 3.8%, 24.3% ± 1.4%). Otherwise the expression density value of CD 34 antigen declined (56.0% ± 4.8%, 44.2% ± 2.2%, 28.8% ± 1.0%) and Brdu antigen showed an upward trend at post-operation (10.0% ± 1.1%, 36.0% ± 4.2%, 48.8% ± 5.0%).After ischemia/reperfusion injury in kidney, the expression rates of CD133 and KIM-1 antigen rise obviously in cortex renis. And the D34 and Brdu antigens show a similar trend in medulla renis. The result indicates that the phenomenon of proliferation and differentiation may appears in kidney proximal tubule and migrate from the region of medulla renis to cortex renis. The participating cells not only possess the strong proliferation and repairing ability of stem/progenitor cells, but also can expresses the CD34 and CD133 antigens. Thus it is may provide a study basis for the tissue reconstruction of nephron and research in the field of kidney adult stem cell.",

        "abstract": "The research concerns in the preparation and TiO2 assembly of mesoporous silica films at ambient pressure by sol-gel technique. First, the silicate sol was prepared with the procursor acitetraehoxysilane (TEOS) and cationic surfactant hexadecyl trime-thyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) or amphiphilic triblock copolymer (EO20PO70EO20) as template dissolved in ethanol and catalyzed by hydrochloric acid. Then the film was obtained by dip coating, and both XRD patterns and TEM image indicate that the films are highly ordered. Finally, the TiO2 nanofiber was prepared by impregnating a mesoporous silica film with TiCl4 followed by hydrolysis in air and calcination at high temperature in the oven. The prepared TiO2 nanofiber diameter is in the range of 50-300 nm and it was characterized by SEM. TiO2 nanofibers can't be formed on film containting template or bare substrate. TiO2 nanofiber morphology can be varied by controlling the pore size of the mesoporous silica film. TiO2 nanofiber has anatase phase after heating at 200-600°C and its crystallization increases with calcination temperature increasing.",

        "abstract": "Self-heating effect can be applied to develop gas sensors avoiding use of external heaters. We report here a prototype self-heated hydrogen gas sensor based on Pt-coated W 18 O 49 nanowire networks. Such a sensor has been shown to have promising performance, e.g., high sensitivity (able to detect down to 50 ppm of H 2 ), good selectivity (poor response to ethanol, CH 4 , CO, and C 3 H 8 ), and low power consumption of 30–60 mW at 6 V compatible to a portable device. Coaxial cable model and percolation theory are applied to explain the gas sensing effect of the Pt-coated W 18 O 49 nanowire networks. Keywords Gas sensor Nanowire Tungsten oxide Self-heated device Hydrogen Hydrogen sensor 1 Introduction There have been continuous efforts in exploring the metal oxide semiconductor gas sensors with high sensitivity, good selectivity, and stability. The mechanism of gas sensing is considered mainly due to surface reduction and oxidation. The large ratio of surface area to volume of nanostructures has been shown to be useful to develop high sensitivity gas sensors. Due to the activation nature of chemical reactions (Arrhenius's law), temperature is an important factor that affects the sensitivity of the sensor. In order to increase the reactivity at surface, the sensing material of a gas sensor is generally operated at temperatures between 100 and 500 °C [1,2] , and thus additional heating is required in a device. On the other hand, in order to acquire strong sensing effect, it is desirable to have the grain size of the sensing material being as small as possible, e.g., in the range of Debye length [3] . When a sensor is operated at high temperature for long periods, such small grains may become aggregated, which will consequently result in degradation in sensing ability [3–6] . The emergence of semiconductor oxide nanostructures offers a prospective solution due to their highly crystalline in axis but nanosized dimension in lateral [4,5] . Among the nanostructures investigated for gas sensing, ZnO nanorod [7] , SnO 2 nanowire [8] , and TiO 2 nanotube [9] with attractive sensing performance have been reported. In particular, Prades et al. [10] recently demonstrated a novel gas sensor based on a single SnO 2 nanowire. The SnO 2 nanowire can heat itself by the bias current passing through it, thus the requirement of external heater is avoided. Such single nanowire gas sensor has low power consumption, and gives a proof-of-concept for developing self-heated nanowire sensors without integrated heaters. In light of the ideas above, we consider self-heated gas sensors fabricated by using W 18 O 49 nanowire networks. In our early work, three-dimensional (3D) WO 3− x network films have been shown to have very high sensitivity for various gases such as NO 2 , and H 2 S [3] . Here, as shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (b) , the nanowires as-prepared have intercrossings and thus not only the axial semiconducting channel in each nanowire but also the junctions between the overlapping nanowires can be modulated by tested gases [11,12] . The electrical contacts between nanowires in such samples are self-assembled, avoiding complicated fabrication processes. Moreover, in the present work we have added Pt nanoparticles on the surface of the nanowires in order to further enhance the gas sensing capability. Such a sensor has been shown to have promising performance. Through this study, we show that the nano-size effect on self-heating may be employed in a nanowire film-based gas sensor, giving a further support to the proof-of-concept reported by the early authors [10] . 2 Experiment The growth of W 18 O 49 nanowires was carried out by thermal evaporation deposition, as has been described elsewhere by ourselves [13] . Fig. 1 (a) and (b) shows the typical SEM images of W 18 O 49 nanowire networks in the top and cross-sectional views, respectively. The nanowires with diameters of 50 nm and 2 μm in lengthes, overlap each other and form a network structure. Such nanowire networks provide large surface area in 3D space. Compared to the pressed nanograin thin film, in which only surface of the upper layer can be exposed to gas species, the nanowire networks can, in principle, expose all the surface of each nanowire to tested gas. Additionally, the nanowire networks can remain stable for long periods at relative high temperature due to their high crystallinity [5] . After the growth of W 18 O 49 nanowire films, we coated a thin layer of Pt onto the surface of nanowires by sputtering. TEM image in Fig. 1 (c) shows that the Pt particles are uniformly coated around the nanowire. The design of our prototype device is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2 (a) . Firstly, interdigitated electrodes were prepared on ceramic substrate (Al 2 O 3 , 1.5 mm × 1.8 mm). Then Pt coated W 18 O 49 (denoted as Pt–W 18 O 49 in the following) nanowire networks were prepared locally on the central area of the ceramic substrate. As illustrated in Fig. 2 (a), the current can flow from one finger electrode to its counterpart (their separation was about 200 μm) by passing through the nanowires and the junctions of the overlapping nanowires. To meet the voltage requirement of portable devices, the samples should be operated at low bias voltage (e.g., <9 V). On the other hand, in order to achieve self-heating effect in nanowire networks, enough power is needed. We have found that W 18 O 49 nanowire networks are ideal self-heating sensing material owning to their low resistivity; sensors based on materials with high resistivity, such as WO 3 nanowires, have difficulty in producing enough Joule heat at a voltage below 9 V. It is known from the literature that the conductivity of tungsten oxide films depends on the stoichiometry of the films [14] . For example, the W 18 O 49 exhibited very low electrical resistivity of 1.75 × 10 −3 Ω cm [15] , while WO 3 shows resistivity with order of magnitude at 10 7 Ω cm [16] . In order to minimize power consumption of the self-heated devices, the samples were suspended with the bonding wires to form heat insulation structure so as to reduce heat dissipation, as shown in Fig. 2 (a). Also we developed an aging procedure for the self-heating nanowire networks to avoid electrical variation during device operation. This was done by sequentially applying increasing bias voltages in air (25 °C, humility of 30%). The bias voltages were increased from 1 V to 8 V, with step of 1 V and time interval of 10 min. Then the nanowire samples were maintained at 8 V for 30 min. After aging, the samples were set to operate at or smaller than 6 V, which is a standard working voltage of today's portable devices. We checked using Raman spectroscopy that after aging, the nanowires remain as W 18 O 49 . Typical nanowire sample that operated in self-heated mode is shown in Fig. 2 (a). A load resistor R L (150 Ω) is connected in series with the nanowire sample. A fixed voltage (1–6 V) is then applied to the circuit. Change of electrical characteristics of the prototype sensor was studied by monitoring the voltage ( U L ) across the load resistor ( R L ). This arrangement could be expanded to record 1–8 samples simultaneously with a data acquisition card (National Instrument DAQ). The voltage U L was recorded twice per second. The gas detection studies were carried out in a customized gastight chamber, with volume of 16 L. Different concentrations of gases in dry air were provided by injecting pure tested gases of certain volumes. The gas concentrations were determined by volume ratio of injected tested gas and the chamber. The steady-state response of the nanowire samples was also studied. According to the Clifford and Tuma [17] , this should be done in a stable environment; and the time of measurement should be long enough to insure adsorption of gas molecules to reach steady-state. In our experiment, steady-state response of the nanowire samples was designed as following. First, the sample was connected to an external mini-ceramic heater to have a desirable constant working temperature. Second, a constant DC voltage of small value (e.g., 0.1 V) was directly applied to the nanowire sample to prevent self-heated effect, and the current passing through the sample in air or in different concentrations of H 2 was monitored. To consider the effect of temperature on the electrical response, the sample was tested at temperatures ranging from 100 °C to 250 °C. Before the gas sensing measurement was carried out, the sample was annealed in air at 350 °C for 24 h. 3 Results and discussion Hydrogen sensing characteristics relalted to self-heating effect of the W 18 O 49 nanowire networks were investigaed. The sensor was exposed to different concentrations of H 2 , and operated at applied voltages of 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 V. The substrate temperature was measured with a thermocouple when sensor was operated at different voltages. As shown in Fig. 2 (b), substrate temperature increased with applied voltages. Considering the thermocouple may take away certain amount of Joule heat, the temperature of the nanowires surface may be higher in actual operation. The typical results of response are shown in Fig. 3 (a) . The resistance of the Pt-coated W 18 O 49 nanowire networks sensor is seen to be reduced significantly by exposing to H 2 . We calculated the response (relative resistance change) of the sensor using the expression of Δ R / R o = ( R o − R g )/ R o . Here R o and R g are the resistance of the sensor before and in exposing to the tested gas, respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 3 (b), the activity of the sensor significantly depends on the applied voltages. When the sensor operated at 4, 5, and 6 V, it was able to detected 50 ppm of H 2 . But the sensor was insensitive to such a low concentration of 50 ppm, while operated at 1, 2, and 3 V. The smallest H 2 concentration that the sensor can detect (detection limit) became low as the applied voltages increased. In addition, the response obtained for the same concentration of H 2 (in the range of 50–400 ppm) also increases with increasing applied voltage. Obviously, the self-heating was gradually enhanced as applied voltage is increased, leading to increase of the surface reactivity for redox reactions. However, though the sensor has high responses at high applied voltages, they gradually become saturated as the concentration increases. As shown in Fig. 3 (c), the response per unit concentration decreases as the H 2 concentration increases, when the sensor is operated at the voltages of 4, 5 and 6 V. The electrical stability analysis of the self-heated Pt–W 18 O 49 nanowire was carried out. The self-heated nanowire samples were kept at 6 V at all times for long-term operations. As shown in Fig. 4 (a) , the electrical resistance of each sample during a 4-day operation did not change much. We then carried on the aging process, and checked the resistance of each sample at 12th, 14th, 16th and 19th day. Fig. 4 (a) shows that self-heated nanowire samples operated in air were stable over 19 days. Meanwhile, we also measured the variation of voltage of each sample (Δ U L ) when it was repeatedly exposed to 1000 ppm of H 2 . Fig. 4 (b) shows that all of the samples have good response reproducibility for H 2 gas sensing. In the kind of experiment described above, the Pt–W 18 O 49 nanowire sample is operated in self-heated mode. During hydrogen sensing, the voltage across the sample will change, which then lead to the variation of the temperature of the nanowires, and thus affect the rate of gas adsorption. In addition, the exact surface temperatures in different operating voltages are unknown. In order to understand the H 2 sensing performance of Pt–W 18 O 49 nanowire films at different working temperatures, we further measure the sample under stable environmental conditions and study its steady state response. The performance of the Pt–W 18 O 49 nanowire film sample in a temperature range from 100 °C to 250 °C was studied at a constant applied voltage (0.1 V) and at four fixed operating temperatures. Typical results are given in Fig. 5 (a)–(d) . First, the trend of current response to H 2 is basically the same; i.e., the current response increases as the gas concentration increases. Second, with increase of temperature up to 200 °C, the magnitude of current response to a specific gas concentration increases, but goes downward from 200 °C to 250 °C. This characteristic is similar to the early findings showing that there is an optimal operating temperature for metal oxides gas sensor [18,19] . If the temperature is too low, the reaction rate between the target gas and the surface is too slow to give a high response, whereas if the temperature is too high, catalytic combustion of the gas with O 2 in the air will happen, so that the concentration of the gas molecules at the surface becomes low [20] . Third, the sample has shorter response and recovery times when it operates at higher temperatures. Fourth, at the operating temperatures of 200 °C and 250 °C, the Pt–W 18 O 49 nanowire film sample has step-like response and recovery curves. This indicates that the current response can reach a steady state in a short time. This is in contrary to the case of operating temperature of 100 °C, where the response and recovery curves are knife-like. The reaction dynamics are very slow at low operating temperature and the steady state value was not reached in our time cycle. To investigate the nature of reaction kinetics of hydrogen with the Pt–W 18 O 49 nanowires, the time dependent of resistance of the Pt–W 18 O 49 nanowire films on exposed to 1000 ppm of H 2 gas at four different temperatures are given in Fig. 5 (e). Also, the maximum rates of resistance change of each curve are determined [21] . The rate of resistance change becomes greater as temperature increases. Activation energy of 23.6 kJ/mol may be calculated from the slope of the Arrhenius plot, as shown in Fig. 5 (f), which is slightly greater than the Pd-coated ZnO nanowires (11.8 kJ/mol) reported early [21] . The major characteristics of the Pt–W 18 O 49 nanowire film sample and the other nanostructure materials reported early by other authors are compared in Table 1 . The responses of all the sensors are normalized to ( R o − R g )/ R o . Since R g is smaller than R o and greater than zero, the range of ( R o − R g )/ R o is from 0 to 1. Table 1 lists responses of our nanowire sensor exposed to 50, 200, 500 and 1000 ppm of H 2 operated at 200 °C. Although not all the concentrations of H 2 used in the referred works are exactly the same as that of ours, the responses of some sensors tested in the similar level of H 2 concentrations may still be compared. First, let us look at the performance of the nanostructured materials [7,22,23] operated using external heating. All of these nanowire/nanorod sensors, operated at 150–250 °C, exhibit large response to H 2 and the values of response of these sensors are slightly larger than that of our Pt–W 18 O 49 nanowire films. But typically they are in the same order of magnitude of that of ours. It is also noticed that all of the values are approximate to 1 in all ranges of concentration of H 2 , revealing that the responses of these sensors to H 2 show the states between “on” or “off”. This means that they were not capable of discriminating different concentrations of H 2 . However, our Pt–W 18 O 49 nanowire samples were capable of doing so. Second, as compared to the non-heated sensors [21,24–26] , our samples, when operated at 200 °C, shows greater response and faster response time than the non-heated Pd-coated ZnO, GaN and Pt-coated InN, GaN nanowires. In order to investigate the hydrogen selectivity of the self-heated Pt–W 18 O 49 nanowire sample, the responses of the sample to 1000 ppm of H 2 , ethanol, CH 4 , CO, and C 3 H 8 , were obtained. As can be seen in Fig. 6 , the Pt–W 18 O 49 sensor is highly selective to H 2 when operated at applied voltages of 4 V to 1 V. The response to ethanol, CO and C 3 H 8 is also relatively very weak when the sensor is operated at 5 V and 6 V. Generally, selectivity in semiconductor gas sensors may be achieved through various of methods, such as: (i) the use of specific surface additives; (ii) the use of filters; (iii) the use of working temperature control; and (iv) the use of catalysts and promoters [20,27] . The high selectivity of H 2 sensing of the self-heated nanowires sensor we study here may be due to the choice of last two methods. The H 2 molecules can be disassociated at Pt and spill-over to the metal oxides [20,28] . Moreover, many studies clearly show that hydrogen spill-over can take place at room temperature and the spill-over hydrogen atoms can be involved in reaction at the surface of metal oxides [21,24–26,29] . It is also suggested that some hydrocarbon (like ethanol and CH 4 ) could also be decomposed at the catalyst surface and provided H atoms [28,30] . However, the yield rates of hydrogen can differ by orders of magnitude depending on the catalyst-metal oxides system and reaction temperature [28] . In our case, strong response of the self-heated nanowire sample towards H 2 may be due to the very effective dissociation of H 2 into H atoms by Pt, and then spill-over to the nanowires surface to react with the absorbed oxygen and also to diffuse into the nanowires. Responses of sample on exposed to other molecules such as CH 4 or ethanol are quite weak. This may be due to the fact that the yield rate of hydrogen was too low at the surface of self-heated Pt–W 18 O 49 nanowires. The employment of Pt catalyst in our nanowire samples can lower the working temperature according the early study of Ippolito et al. [31] . The H 2 molecules will favorably adsorb onto the surface of Pt and are disassociated into H atoms. Then the H atoms will diffuse to the surface of the metal oxide (i.e., the spill-over process) and react with the oxygen that is previously adsorbed at the surface. In our experiment, without Pt catalyst coating, our self-heated samples did not show any responses on exposure to H 2 . Further, we compare the power consumption of self-heated Pt–W 18 O 49 sensor and the typical sensors based on ceramic tubes/substrates, and MEMS silicon substrates ( Table 2 ). Our prototype sensors operated at power level of 30–60 mW, which are comparable with the sensors based on elegant MEMS process [32] . We adapt coaxial cable model [11,12,33] and percolation theory [34] to explain the sensing mechanism of the Pt-coated W 18 O 49 nanowire networks. The detail discussions are shown following. Firstly, we explain why the conductance of the W 18 O 49 networks increases with increasing concentration of H 2 . As illustrated in (I) of Fig. 7 (a) , the adsorbed oxygen molecules trap electrons at the surface when the nanowires are exposed to air, leading to the presence of a depletion region in surface layer, and the narrowing of the semiconducting channels in the nanowires. In each nanowire, free carriers (electrons) can transport along the semiconducting channel, while electrons transport between the overlapping nanowires, they have to pass through a potential barrier at a junction. The electron transport in the junction can be described in terms of a thermoelectronic emission mechanism [35] . With introduction of H 2 gas, hydrogen molecules will first be dissociated into hydrogen species by Pt nanoparticles [27,36] ((II) of Fig. 7 (a)), and may subsequently react with the absorbed oxygen species to form H 2 O molecules. In addition, the hydrogen species may also undergo a reaction with the lattice oxygen atoms of tungsten oxide to form localized water molecules [37] . Such reducing reactions release the electrons trapped at the nanowires’ surface. As a result, the thickness of the depletion layer decreases, and the semiconducting channel is widened. Meanwhile, the potential barrier heights at the junctions between nanowires become lower. The modulation of both semiconducting channel and potential barrier height contributes to the change in the resistance of the gas sensor. The depleted layer thickness, barrier height, and reactivity of surface reactions could be changed to favor to enhance the response with increasing temperature, thus greater response is obtained. Secondly, we explain the detection limit and sensing saturation effect of the sensor. The response of the W 18 O 49 nanowire networks also depends on the availability of the conduction paths through the overlapping nanowires. Fig. 7 (b) illustrates how the percolating theory may be used to explain the conduction of the nanowire networks of our prototype sensor. The nanowires in air will exhibit high resistance state (left of Fig. 7 (b)) due to less conduction paths available. When H 2 gas is introduced, some nanowires switch from high resistance state to low resistance state. Meanwhile, barrier heights at junctions between nanowires turn low. Then paths of low resistance state composed of overlapping nanowires will be formed between two adjacent electrodes (right of Fig. 7 (b)). There is a concentration threshold at which the nanowire networks can form the first path. The concentration threshold turns low as chemical reactivity of the nanowire networks increases. 4 Conclusion In summary, the present work has demonstrated a prototype of self-heated hydrogen gas sensors based on Pt-coated W 18 O 49 nanowire networks. The concept of single nanowire-based self-heated gas sensor proposed early [10] can be employed in a nanowire film-based gas sensor. The response of our prototype sensor could be modulated by self-heating effect of the nanowires. Coaxial cable model and percolation theory can be used to explain the gas sensing behavior of the Pt-coated W 18 O 49 nanowire networks. Such prototype sensors have exhibited attractive performances, and they may be further developed for practical application.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Exploring an efficient and inexpensive noble-metal-free co-catalyst to replace noble-metal is a huge challenge for photocatalytic H 2  evolution. Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) as co-catalysts for photocatalytic H 2  generation have been extensively employed due to their exceedingly good property, stability and low cost. Herein, a new photocatalyst containing g-C 3 N 4  and porous network-like MoP as a highly efficient co-catalyst was fabricated. The maximal H 2 -generation rate of the MoP/g-C 3 N 4  photocatalyst could reach 327.5 µmol⋅g -1 ⋅h -1 , which was ∼3.4 times higher than that of pure g-C 3 N 4 . The quantum efficiency achieved 9.6% at 400 nm. The improvement in photocatalytic H 2 -generation of MoP/g-C 3 N 4  was resulted from the proper Fermi level alignment and the close contact interfaces of porous network-like MoP and g-C 3 N 4 , in which MoP not only increased light absorption but also fasted the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers as well as lowered the H 2  evolution overpotentials. The possible photocatalytical mechanism of the MoP/g-C 3 N 4  photocatalyst was speculated based on various characterization techniques. It is believed that this study can offer a novel pathway to design high-performance and low-cost photocatalytic materials composed of metal phosphide co-catalyst for efficient water-splitting H 2 -generation over semiconductors under visible-light illumination.",

        "abstract": "\n We have presented in this chapter the general formalism of block correlated coupled cluster method with a CASSCF reference\n function (CAS-BCCC in short) and a number of its applications for electronic structure calculations of molecules with multireference\n character. The CAS-BCCC method has the following features: (1) free of the intruder states; (2) invariant with respect to\n orbital rotations within separated orbital subspaces (occupied, active, and virtual); (3) cost-effective; (4) core-extensive,\n but not size-extensive with respect to the total number of electrons. With the cluster operator truncated up to the four-block\n correlation level, the approximate CAS-BCCC method is named as CAS-BCCC4. The CAS-BCCC4 method is applied to investigate a\n number of chemical problems such as bond breaking potential energy surfaces, singlet-triplet gaps of diradicals, reaction\n barriers, spectroscopic constants of diatomic molecules, and low-lying excited states. Comparisons between results from CAS-BCCC4\n and those from FCI or other theoretical methods demonstrate that the CAS-BCCC4 approach provides very accurate descriptions\n for all problems under study. The overall performance of CAS-BCCC4 is illustrated to be better than that of CASPT2 and MR-CISD\n methods.\n \n ",

In this paper, the isothermal vapour liquid equilibrium (VLE) of (ammonia + 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) system at temperatures ranging from (243.150 to 283.150) K are presented. Two models were employed to regress the experimental VLE results, namely the Peng–Robinson (PR) equation of state with the simple van der waals (VDW) mixing rule; the Peng–Robinson equation of state combined non-random two-liquid (NRTL) activity coefficient model with the modified Huron-Vidal one-order (MHV1) mixing rule. The maximum average absolute relative deviation of pressure (AARD p ) and average absolute deviation of the vapour phase mole fraction (AAD y ) for PR-VDW are 0.56% and 0.010, respectively, while the maximum AARD p  and AAD y  for PR-MHV1-NRTL are 0.27% and 0.014, respectively. Positive azeotropic behaviour was exhibited at each temperature investigated.",

        "abstract": "Skewed X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is a rare reason for hemophilia B in females. It is indefinite whether X chromosome reactivation (XCR) would occur when cells of hemophilia B patients with skewed XCI were reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In this study, we investigated a female hemophilia B patient with a known F9 gene mutation: c.676C>T, p.Arg226Trp. We demonstrated that skewed XCI was the pathogenesis of the patient, and we successfully generated numerous iPSC colonies of the patient from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs), which was the first time for generating hemophilia-specific iPSCs from PBMNCs. Then we detected the XCI state of these iPSCs. Ninety-two iPSC lines were picked for XCI analysis. All of them retained an inactive X chromosome, which could be proved by amplification of the androgen receptor gene and XIST (X inactivation-specific transcript), expression of H3K27me3, and existence of XIST clouds in XIST RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. We attempted to obtain iPSC lines with the wild-type F9 gene on the active X chromosome for further disease treatment. But it turned out that the patient's iPSCs were still skewed such as the somatic cells with 92 iPSC lines having mutant F9 on the active X chromosome. In conclusion, skewed XCI is one reason for hemophilia in females. PBMNCs are excellent somatic cell resources for hemophilia patients to do reprogramming. More attentions should be paid to generate naive iPSCs with two active X chromosomes for further clinical disease treatment. The state of skewed XCI is retained in the iPSCs from a female with hemophilia B.",

The silica precursor sol was then modified by methyltriethoxysilane (MTES) to obtain modified silica sol organically. The results show that the modified silica sol organically modified by MTES is better than that modified by hexame-thyldisihazane HMDS. Hydrophobic nanoporous silica film with a refractive index of 1.10 and adjusted from 1.1 to 1.38 can be prepared by evaporation-induced self-assembly process and MTES modification. The porosity and dielectric constant of the film are about 81.8% and 1.77, respectively. The infrared spectrum of the film indicates that the film is hydrophobic due to the introduction of the methyl groups and the picture of a drop of water on the film supports this result.",

Their field-induced electron emission characteristics, i.e., current-voltage characteristics and distribution of emission sites, were studied using the transparent anode imaging technique. A repeatable abrupt change of \"on\" and \"off\" states of emission was observed at two corresponding specific fields during circling of both increasing and decreasing applied gap fields.

The mesoporous silica film exhibits ordered 2D hexagonal microstructure as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and small angle X-ray diffraction (SAXRD). The average transmittance of the coated glass is about 98%, which indicates an increasing transmitted light of 7.5% in the wavelength between 400nm and 800nm. The mechanical performance and hydrophobicity tests prove that the films have excellent scratch resistance and long-time stability.

The ferrum and gadlinium derviative contrast agents were mainly used to paramagnetically label the stem cell, and each had its own advantages and disadvatages. Currently, on the basis of paramagnetically labelling of the stem cell with ferrum and gadlinium derviative contrast agents, MRI had been succeessfully used to monitor the stem cell in vivo and had been applied into animal model of the heart and brain stroke, but these are still some problems exist such as the selection of vehicle transferring the contrast agents into stem cells, the labeling efficiency, the duration of labelling and the viablity and heredity changes of the stem cell after labelling.",

The results show that the solid-liquid interface morphology has an evolutionary process of planar �� cellular �� dendritic interface with the increasing withdrawal rate. The primary Cr(Mo) dendrites are gradually weeded out through competitive growth between the primary phase and the eutectic phase. The volume fraction of primary Cr(Mo) dendrites decreases with the modest addition of Dy (0.05 wt.%) at 6 ��m/s. When the withdrawal rate increases to 30 ��m/s, the appropriate addition of Dy (0.1 wt.%) refines the microstructure, such as the width of intercellular zone and the lamellar thickness in the intercellular zone. With the increase of withdrawal rate to 90 ��m/s, the addition of Dy has no significant effect on the microstructure. In addition, the white Dy-containing phase can occur in the boundary of eutectic cells when the Dy content is no less than 0.1 wt.%. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The effects of hydrogen on the crystallization process of Zr-Ti-Cu-Ni-Be bulk amorphous alloy were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Kissinger equation and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). It is shown that hydrogen increases the activation energy of the glass transition and crystallization, and retards the nucleation and crystal growth. Moreover, hydrogen charging contributes to the formation of isolated crystals, resulting in the precipitation of fine and uniformly distributed nanocrystallines.",

Methods In total 48 patients with maxillofacial diseases were examined using three-dimensional CT with a reconstruction interval of 1mm and a pitch of 1.5. All raw data were transferred to workstation and post-processed with the technique of the SSD and VR. The imaging findings were compared with surgical and pathological findings. Results Three-dimensional CT was superior to two-dimensional CT in showing the location, size, shape and extent of the lesions. The bone destruction was objectively demonstrated, while the details of the soft tissue were not revealed. Conclusion Three-dimensional CT provides spatial anatomical relationship of the disorders. Two-dimensional CT and three-dimensional CT have their own advantages respectively in the demonstrating and diagnosing the maxillofacial lesions. Integration of these two methods can improve the accuracy of imaging diagnosis.",

Both the ZrO 2 films and ZrO 2-PVP composite films were characterized by ellipsometer, FTIR, AFM respectively. The crystallization behavior of ZrO 2 xerogels was examined by X-ray diffraction. And 1-on-l laser-induced damage threshold tests on ZrO 2 films and ZrO 2-PVP composite films were carried out with a Q-switched Nd: YAG high power laser at 1064 nm with a pulse width of 10 ns. The measured laser-induced damage threshold of ZrO 2 films with heat treatment at 300°C for 60 min was 24.5 J/cm 2, and 37.5 J/cm 2 for that of ZrO 2-PVP composite films. The experimental results show that the incorporating organic binder PVP (polyvinyl pyrrolidone), without obvious influence on film surface micro morphology, helps to improve the performances of ZrO 2 films such as high refractive index, thickness and laser induced damage threshold. The ZrO 2-PVP composite films can achieve good performances with high refractive index of 1.75 and the laser-induced damage threshold of 37.8 J/cm 2, which is 50% higher than that of ZrO 2 films.",

A systematic detrimental effect of applied loading and aggressive ions on passive current density and localized corrosion was found. The high applied loading deteriorated the stability of passivation of AMC, which increased the passivation density and the pitting tendency. The fracture surface of AMC exhibited brittle fracture morphology with no significant crack branching. A mechanism was proposed in which the localized corrosion taking place preferentially at coating defects, and for producing the necessary crack-tip geometry. The tensile stresses accelerated the localized corrosion susceptibility near the defects by forming microcracks and promoting fast diffusion path for chloride ions. The poor environmental cracking resistance of AMC was attributed to the low protective effect of the passive film for the stress assisted localized corrosion at the crack tip and to the metastable nature of the amorphous structure.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the tensile deformation behavior of Zr 41.25 Ti 13.75 Ni 10 Cu 12.5 Be 22.5 (at%) bulk metallic glass in the supercooled liquid region. Isothermal tensile tests were carried out at four characteristic temperatures of 616, 636, 656 and 676 K which are in the range from glass transition temperature (∼616 K) to onset crystallization temperature (∼690 K). The results show that the superplastic flow behaviors of the material (flow stress and elongation to fracture) vary, depending strongly on the test temperatures and initial strain-rates. At a given temperature, the elongation first increases and then decreases with the initial strain-rate increasing, and the maximum elongation was found to be as high as 1625% at the temperature of 656 K with the strain-rate of 7.6×10 −3 s −1 . DSC analysis shows the crystallized volume fraction in the deformed section is always higher than that of the undeformed section in the specimens. The maximum elongation always corresponds to the maximum crystallized volume fraction. Nanocrystals homogeneously embedded in the amorphous matrix of the deformed specimens were observed by transmission electron microscope. It is conjectured that the nanocrystallization was induced by the flow stress and environmental temperature. Keywords B. Glasses, metallic B. Superplastic behaviour D. Microstructure F.

They also have a good processability in the supercooled liquid state, which is attractive for applications in near-net-shape fabrication of complex components [3,4] . Since the 1990s, superplastic behavior of BMGs in the supercooled liquid region has been widely studied. Kawamura et al. [5–10] , Lu et al. [11] and Johnson et al. [12] showed that the high temperature deformation behavior of Zr-based BMGs could be classified as Newtonian or non-Newtonian type flow. Nieh et al. [13] , Lee et al. [14] and Bae et al. [15] studied the phase transformation of BMGs during superplastic flow process and found that nanocrystallization could be induced by an applied stress. Nieh et al. [16] suggested that non-Newtonian type flow could be attributed to nanocrystallization during deformation of a BMG. So far, the reports about tensile tests of BMGs in the supercooled liquid region are relatively limited. In this paper, tensile deformation behavior of a BMG was investigated at various initial strain-rates and temperatures. 2 Experimental procedure The material used in the present study has the composition Zr 41.25 Ti 13.75 Ni 10 Cu 12.5 Be 22.5 . Alloy ingots were prepared by arc-melting a mixture of pure metal elements in a titanium-gettered argon atmosphere, followed by suction into a copper mold to form sheet-like BMG samples with a size of 3×70×30 mm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed to observe the microstructure by using a TECNAI T20 (200 kV) microscope and a PHILIPS EM430 (300 kV) microscope. The TEM samples were prepared using standard twin-jet electropolishing in a solution containing one part nitric acid and two parts methanol at 248 K. The thermal properties of the alloy were measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in a Pekin–Elmer Pyris 1 DSC. The onset glass transition temperature ( T g onset ) , glass transition end temperature ( T g end ) and onset crystallization temperature ( T x ) were examined at a heating rate of 20 K/min. Tensile test specimens were fabricated from the sheet-like BMG samples by means of electrical discharge machining. They had a gauge length of 11 mm, a thickness of 3 mm and a width of 1.1 mm. High temperature deformation tests were conducted using an Instron 5500R1186 type machine equipped with an air furnace. Tensile tests were carried out at the temperatures of 616, 636, 656 and 676 K. These temperatures were in the range of T g – T x , which involves the supercooled liquid region of the BMG. 3 Results and discussion DSC curve of the as-cast BMG sample is shown in Fig. 1 . T g onset , T g end and T x can be clearly identified as 616, 656 and 698 K, respectively. The stress–strain curves for the BMG specimens at different test temperatures and strain-rates are shown in Fig. 2 . As can be seen, BMG shows homogeneous deformation in the supercooled liquid region. Typically, a yield drop or a stress overshoot phenomenon is observed. The stress reaches a peak and then decreases significantly with increasing strain. The yield drop phenomenon has also been reported in Pd 40 Ni 40 P 20 [5] , Zr 65 Al 10 Ni 10 Cu 15 [7] , Fe 72 Hf 8 Nb 2 B 18 [8] and Zr 52.5 Ti 5 Ni 14.6 Cu 17.9 Al 10 [14] alloys. It is considered to be the result of rapid increase of free volume during the process of deformation. On reaching the peak stress, the excessive free volume is quickly redistributed via rearrangement of local atoms, which may induce the yield drop. In the present study BMG is considered to be a kind of material without defects, unable to exhibit the strain-hardening during the tensile deformation process. Therefore the local necking is unavoidable as shown in Fig. 3 . As a result, the stress yield drop is affected by the local necking besides the redistribution of the free volume. It is evident in Fig. 2 that the flow stress, peak stress and elongation depend strongly on strain-rates and test temperatures. The BMG exhibits a high fracture stress of 1860 MPa at room temperature (not shown). With increasing temperature to 616 K, the fracture stress decreases to 1388 MPa ( Fig. 2 (a)). At this temperature, sudden fracture is observed in the tensile samples and the deformation is inhomogeneous, which is similar to the behavior at room temperature. On the other hand, in the temperature range of 636–676 K, catastrophic fracture does not occur due to the homogeneous deformation. The yield drop decreases with further increase in temperature. The strain-rate is also a factor in the deformation behavior of the BMG. With decreasing strain-rate the behavior transforms from inhomogeneous to homogeneous deformation, as shown in Fig. 2 (a). The dependence of yield drop on strain-rate is shown in Fig. 2 (b)–(d). The elongation increases initially and then decreases with increasing strain-rate. The maximum elongation reaches as high as 1625% at 656 K with the strain-rate of 7.6×10 −3 s −1 . Fig. 3 shows the tensile specimens after deformed at 656 K with different initial strain-rates. To investigate microstructural evolution during superplastic deformation, a series of DSC analyses were carried out on the deformed specimens. It is conjectured that the strain energy stored during superplastic deformation may reduce the thermal activation energy barrier required for crystallization, as was suggested by Lee et al. [14] , Bae et al. [15] and Nieh et al. [16] . Two samples for DSC measurements were prepared from each deformed specimen. One was cut from the grip section (undeformed section), and another one was cut from the region near to the fracture point (deformed section). Figs. 4 and 5 show the DSC curves for the samples cut from the undeformed and deformed sections after tensile test at 636 and 656 K, respectively. For the purpose of comparison, the DSC trace for the as-cast Zr 41.25 Ti 13.75 Ni 10 Cu 12.5 Be 22.5 alloy is also given. The DSC curves for the specimens deformed at higher strain-rates are similar to that of the as-cast specimen, although the heat of crystallization is lower than that of the as-cast specimen. When the strain-rate decreases to 1.5×10 −3 s −1 at 636 K, 7.6×10 −3 s −1 at 656 K or 3×10 −2 s −1 at 676 K, the first crystallization peak on the DSC curves disappears. These results indicate that the amorphous phase evolves to a primary crystallization during deformation. As we know, BMG generally exhibits a distinct glass transition ( T g ) with an endothermic reaction, followed by the appearance of a wide supercooled liquid region (Δ T x = T x − T g ). Then, an exothermic reaction due to crystallization occurs at the onset crystallization temperature, T x . The heat of crystallization can be measured by integrating the peak area of exothermic crystallization. The crystallized volume fraction for deformed specimens is calculated as: (1) V f = ( 1 − Δ H D Δ H C ) 100 % where Δ H D is the heat of crystallization for a deformed specimen, and Δ H C is the heat of crystallization for the as-cast metallic glass. The value of Δ H D is measured from the deformed and undeformed section of the deformed samples, respectively. The integrated heat of crystallization and the tensile elongation measured from the deformed and undeformed sections of specimens tested under various conditions are summarized in Table 1 . The crystallized volume fraction reaction percentage and the corresponding elongations, varying with the strain-rates at different test temperatures, are summarized in Fig. 6 . It is evident that the crystallized volume fraction percentages of the undeformed sections decrease with increasing strain-rate. This is because the time for the sample exposed to high temperature increases with decreasing strain-rate. It is also clearly shown that the reaction percentages of deformed sections are always higher than those of the undeformed sections when the specimens are exposed at a given temperature. This indicates that the crystallization of amorphous phase is affected by both environmental heating and flow stress. In the undeformed sections crystallization is affected by the heat treatment during the superplastic extension process. For the deformed sections, however, the crystallization is affected by both flow stress and isothermal treatment. Lee et al. [14] and Nieh et al. [16] studied the microstructure of BMGs after superplastic deformation and suggested that the flow stress could induce crystallization at temperatures below the crystallization temperature during the superplastic deformation. In present study it is found that, when tensile test is carried out in the supercooled liquid region, transformation of amorphous phase to crystalline phase occurs because the DSC analysis shows that the heats of crystallization of undeformed sections are always less than that of the as-cast specimen. On the other hand, this phase transformation process is accelerated by the applied flow stress because the heats of crystallization of deformed sections are always less than those of undeformed sections (as shown in Table 1 ). As seen from Fig. 6 , the changes of crystallized volume fraction of the deformed samples with strain-rate are quite different from those of the undeformed samples. The former generally shows a peak (except for deformation at a lower temperature of 616 K) at a specific strain-rate, roughly, at which the elongation also features a peak value. For example, in the case of deformation at 636 K with the strain-rate of 1.5×10 −3 s −1 , the elongation of the specimen reaches its maximum of 1110%, and the crystallized volume fraction reaches its maximum of 14.2%. This implies that crystallization occurs to the largest extent in the deformation process of the deformed samples with the largest elongation. This finding provides direct evidence for the statement that crystallization of amorphous material could be activated either by heating or by stress. A further study of BMG's microstructure is carried out using TEM. Fig. 7 shows images and the corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns for the samples tested at 636 K with the strain-rate of 7.6×10 −4 s −1 ( Fig. 7 (a) and (b)) and at 656 K with the strain-rate of 7.6×10 −3 s −1 ( Fig. 7 (c) and (d)). The TEM samples were extracted from the deformed section. It is evident that there are dispersed nanocrystals embedded in the amorphous matrix. The nanocrystal sizes are approximately 10±3 nm at 636 K and 25±3 nm at 656 K ( Fig. 7 (a) and (c)). The corresponding SAED patterns show the polycrystalline halos, since the sizes of the precipitated phase are small. The SAED shown in Fig. 7 (b) displays the multiple rings indicating that a substantial fraction of the amorphous phase still exists. The second inner ring of the diffraction pattern of the specimen deformed at 636 K is slightly sharper and the pattern contains two more outer-diffraction rings compared with a diffraction pattern of the as-cast specimen. These features also reveal the presence of nanocrystals embedded in an amorphous matrix. Based on Fig. 7 (d), it is determined that the nanocrystals are hexagonal Be 2 Zr for the specimens deformed at 656 K. This result agrees well with the argument made by Busch et al. [17] and Wanderka et al. [18] . They suggested that Zr 41.25 Ti 13.75 Ni 10 Cu 12.5 Be 22.5 metallic glass annealed between 613 and 673 K would undergo decomposition and primary crystallization. The decomposition brings out Be-rich and Zr-rich regions. In present study, it is confirmed that, when Zr 41.25 Ti 13.75 Ni 10 Cu 12.5 Be 22.5 alloy is exposed at 656 K for a certain time, primary crystallization occurs to produce Be 2 Zr phase as a dominant phase, possibly precipitating from the decomposed Be-rich region. 4 Conclusions (1) The superplastic flow behavior of Zr 41.25 Ti 13.75 Ni 10 Cu 12.5 Be 22.5 bulk metallic glass in the supercooled liquid region, viz. the flow stress and the elongation, varies depending strongly on the test temperature and initial strain-rate. The elongation increases firstly and then decreases with the strain-rate increasing and the maximum elongation reaches as high as 1625% at 656 K with the strain-rate 7.6×10 −3 s −1 . (2) The crystallized volume fraction of deformed section is always higher than the crystallization fraction of undeformed section of the tensile test specimens. The maximum elongation always corresponds to the maximum crystallized volume fraction. And consequently, flow stress and environmental temperature are believed to be two main factors affecting the phase transformation during the superplastic deformation of the amorphous material. (3) It is found that the precipitation of nanocrystals is driven by the flow stress and environmental temperature. In addition, the maximum elongations coinciding with the maximum crystallized volume fraction further illustrates that the effect of the flow stress on nanocrystallization is unavoidable during the tensile deformation process. As a result, the superplastic deformation leads to the precipitation of the nanocrystal phases. Acknowledgements This work is in part supported by Harbin Institute of Technology Foundation.

It was shown that the Ta element adding into alloy matrix changed the crystallization behaviors of continuous heating for the alloys. For (Zr 0.65Ni 0.175 Cu 0.175) 80Ta 10Al 10 alloy composite, the solubility limit of Ta in the amorphous phases is approximately 4%. The maximum stress and plastic strain of the composite containing 10% Ta are as high as 1855 MPa and 3.2%, respectively, both higher than those of the Ta-free BAA. The Ta crystalline particles prevent the catastrophic propagation of the single shear band, favorable for the formation of multiple shear bands, and significantly increasing the plastic strain and yield strength under an uniaxial compression, compared to the Ta-free alloy.",

With increasing Cu content from x=2 to x=5, the martensitic transition temperature, T M , decreases from 220 K to 120 K. Further increasing Cu up to x=10 results in the disappearance of T M . For samples Ni 50Mn33Cu2Sn15 and Ni 50Mn30Cu5Sn15, both martensitic and austenitic states exhibit ferromagnetic characteristics, but the magnetization of martensitic phase is notably lower than that of austenitic phase. The magnetization difference, ΔM, across the martensitic transition leads to a considerably large Zeeman energy, μ 0ΔṀH, which drives a field-induced metamagnetic transition. Associated with the metamagnetic behavior, a large positive magnetic entropy change ΔS takes place around T M . For the sample Ni50Mn33Cu 2Sn15,ΔS reaches 13.5 J/kġ under a magnetic field change from 0 to 5 T. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",

In service selection, we found one additional issue that has not been investigated yet namely time constraints consistency among composite services. This issue is significant because there are potential time constraints involved that might cause inconsistency between selected services although they can offer aggregated QoS that satisfy global requirements. Furthermore, there might be some unintended waiting time to be considered in the QoS aggregation. Thus, this paper contributes to the analysis on the problem caused by the time constraints and proposes general selection approach to tackle these issues. The approach comprises two major functionalities; (i) exploration of the process model based on patterns, (ii) evaluation of candidates based on time constraints and objective functions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The absorption refrigeration system driven by low grade heat sources, especially the waste heat sources, becomes more and more attractive in recent decades. However, most traditional absorption systems cannot achieve a high utilization rate of the waste heat with limited heat capacity. These systems are usually designed to obtain heat in the generator, which means that the waste heat sources cannot be utilized to the temperature lower than the generator temperature. This paper proposed a new structure heated by heat conduction oil in the generator and electric heating rings around the stripping section. This structure can simulate the temperature-distributed heat sources when the electric heating rings work. It can also simulate a traditional generator when the electric heating rings do not work. Influences of different heat distributions are analyzed in detail in this paper. The results show that the heat sources utilization rate will increase with the increase of the heat in the stripping section, while the coefficient of performance will be negatively affected by the increasing heat in the stripping section. By optimizing the heating structure, the coefficient of performance can be similar to that of a traditional system when the heat is just added in the middle and lower part of stripping section. The optimum utilization rate of heat sources in this test model can reach 1.8 times to that of a traditional system. Under this heating model, the lowest temperature required in the heating section is 82 °C when the heat conduction oil inlet temperature is 169 °C. It is much lower than the temperature inside the generator, which is 137.3 °C.",

        "abstract": "In order to investigate the effect of rotating magnetic field on the microstructure formation of peritectic alloys, directional solidification experiments of Sn-1.6Cd peritectic alloy have been conducted under different rotating magnetic field conditions. The directional solidification microstructure of Sn-1.6Cd peritectic alloy changes from banded structure to axisymmetric isolated banded structure to axisymmetric oscillatory tree-like banded structure and to single primary phase structure when the magnetic Taylor number of forced-melt flow generated by a rotating magnetic field increases from 0 to 91 to 364 and to 1456. The second and third banded structures are observed in a peritectic alloy for the first time. The results indicate that it is possible to control solidification microstructure and prepare a single primary phase structure by using a rotating magnetic field during directional solidification of peritectic alloys. The experiments show that the effect of forced-melt flow on solute distribution transforms from solute buildup to homogenization with an increase in the magnetic Taylor number. The formation mechanisms of those structures are also discussed. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",

        "abstract": "Mechanical and contamination-resistance properties are the most crucial and challenging issues which impede the practical application of sol-gel antireflective (AR) coating. In this paper, we report a low-temperature vapor surface treatment strategy for the partial embedding and surface functionalization of silica nanoparticles (SNPs) on flexible polymeric glass substrates. SNPs, which were synthesized via Stöber method, were partially embedded onto the polymeric glass substrates by vapor-phase surface treatment of volatile chloroform. Further vapor-phase surface treatments of water and hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) were applied successively to achieve high trimethylsilyl coverage of the SNPs. The HMDS modification could convert the polar surface of SNPs to nonpolar surface for contamination-resistance, while the ammonia, as by-product generated, could help to cross-link the SNPs via self-condensation of silanol groups, thus hardening the coating. The SNP-CWH coated PMMA substrate shows an average transmittance of 98.62% in the wavelength region of 400-800 nm, which is 6.32% higher than the uncoated bare PMMA. The AR performance of SNP-CWH coated PMMA has almost no degradation after 100 times of rubbing or bending, indicating the greatly enhanced abrasion-resistance and flexibility. Furthermore, the SNP-CWH coating exhibits superior contamination-resistance property, where the transmittance curve of the coated substrate displays barely noticeable change after exposure to a \"dirty\" environment with water and organic contaminants for 6 months. This work paves the new way for developing mechanically robust and contamination-resistant AR coating for polymeric substrates.",

Experimental results show that the use of Al2O3 nanoparticles as dispersions to reinforce WC-Co composites can increase the hardness, especially the transverse rupture strength of the WC-Co hardmetal. With addition of 0.5% (mass fraction) Al2O3 nanoparticles, the spark plasma sintered WC-7Co-0.5Al2O3 nanocomposites exhibit hardness of 21.22 GPa and transverse rupture strength of 3548 MPa. The fracture surface of the WC-7Co-0.5Al2O3 nanocomposites mainly fracture with transcrystalline rupture mode. The reinforcing mechanism is maybe related to the hindrance effect of microcracks propagation and the pinning effect for the dislocations movement, as well as the residual compressive strength due to the Al2O3 nanoparticles doped.",

Second, a Pascal triangle transform, a Pascal triangle matrix, and a systolic structure are proposed to calculate the monomials on a 3-D object boundary surface, which simplifies the monomial calculation. Third, a range-image measurement system is used to implement the new method.

The tests results show that, for the tension anchor cable, shear stress peak value between grouting body and rock hole wall is less than that between grouting body and steel wires, but the shear stress distribution length is longer and the peak value point locates in back grouting segment. The shear stress between grouting body and rock hole wall is not equally distributed no matter what the anchor cable type is, and the peak value point locates at different grouting segment positions. For the pressure anchor cable, shear stress peak value is large and the distribution length is short and shear stress decays quickly under the same load. The effective bonded length of tension anchor cable increases significantly with the increasing resisting load. On the other hand, the shear stress peak value of pressure anchor cable increases significantly with the increasing resisting load. The bearing capacity of tension anchor cable is constant and it is normally adopted when requiring lower bearing capacity, the key construction is ensuring the grouting length. The bearing capacity of pressure anchor cable is in proportion to the number of the pressure bearing segment and it is adopted when requiring higher bearing capacity, the key construction is ensuring the grouting fullness and avoiding the grouting body shrinkage.",

        "abstract": "It is known from the active tectonic research results that the northern margin of Tianshan mountains is characterized with typical intra-continental active tectonics, which has thrust faults and anticlines with multiple parallel mountains. In order to investigate the fine crustal structures and the main fault geometries as well as the deep-shallow tectonic relations in Ürümqi depression, a deep seismic reflection profile of 78 km long, running in nearly SN direction, was completed in 2004. This profile is located in the transition zone between Tianshan mountains and Junggar Basin of the western Ürümqi. The results show that the crust beneath the investigated area is divided into upper and lower crusts by a strong reflective zone with about 9 ∼ 10.5 s TWT. The thicknesses of the upper and lower crusts are about 26 ∼ 28 km, 23 ∼ 25 km, respectively. There are rich reflective layers and clear tectonic patterns above 5s TWT while presenting obviously different tectonic features along the profile. In the southern region of Xishan, the stacked deep seismic reflection section has a series of thrust anticlines extending in the EW direction and arranging in the SN as well as a group of faults thrusting from south to north. All of those are influenced by the deep detachment zone. In the Xishan and Wangjiagou area, it shows a set of steeply north-dipping reflective layers and a group of faults slipping along the layers. The northern part of the profile shows the images of typical sediment basin and its deepest depth is about 10 ∼ 12 km. Between 6 and 9 s TWT, the stacked deep seismic reflection section shows disordered reflections with comparatively short continuing time and weak energy. These indicate that this part of the crust is evidently possessed with \"reflection transparence\". The Moho transition zone occurs at 14 ∼ 17 s TWT, and the zone thickness is about 9 ∼ 10 km. In the studied area, the Moho discontinuity gradually deepens from north to south. Its depth is about 50 ∼ 52 km at the northern segment of the profile and is about 54 ∼ 55 km near north Tianshan. In the neighbourhood of Xishan at the middle profile, the reflections from the boundary between upper and lower crusts as well as Moho transition zone become misty while the shallow stratums show signs of uplift and fold, which may have something to do with the extrusions between Junggar basin and Tianshan mountains.",

With the progress of solidification, the composition of liquid was close to Ti-47Al alloy that is favorable for β phase formation, and β phase started to nucleate and grow among the interdendrites of α phase, therefore lamellar microstructure inclined with an angle of 45° to the DS direction and the process of seeding was interrupted.

        "title": "A TEM study on the crystallization behavior of an yttrium-doped Zr-based bulk metallic glass",
        "abstract": "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is used to conduct the systematic study of the annealing induced crystallization, both continuously and isothermally, of a Zr-based metallic glass. Through detailed microstructure analysis, it is found that the crystallization of this metallic glass is initialized by a nano-scaled primary crystallization process with a tetragonal structured crystal ( a = 0.96 nm and c = 2.82 nm) as the primary phase. A eutectic crystallization is followed afterwards with two types of crystalline phases as the crystallization products, one of which is determined to be a metastable orthorhombic phase ( a = 0.69 nm, b = 0.75 nm and c = 0.74 nm). Upon annealing at a raised temperature or isothermal treatments, a solid state phase transformation takes place and the orthorhombic metastable phase transforms into two types of tetragonal crystalline phases. The whole crystallization process of this metallic glass is in turn realized, and the thermal stability and nano-crystallization mechanism are discussed based on the microstructure and thermal analyses. Keywords B. Glasses, metallic F. Electron microscopy, transmission B. Thermal stability D. Microstructure 1 Introduction Crystallization behavior study has been hotly pursued in the field of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) for at least two reasons. Firstly, it is critical for the achievement of partially or fully nano-crystallized BMG composites, which show higher comprehensive mechanical properties [1,2] or enhanced physical properties, such as soft magnetism [3] . Secondly, it is critical for the thermal stability assessment of BMGs, considering that they are thought to be potentially good industrial materials and yet in metastable states compared with their crystalline counterparts [4] . Zr-based BMGs are one of the best glass forming alloys and have shown prospective engineering applications. Very recently, we discovered that the glass forming ability (GFA) and mechanical properties of an oxygen-containing Zr-based BMG, i.e. Zr 51 Al 16.3 Ni 12 Cu 20.7 , can be optimized in terms of GFA by a 0.5 at% yttrium doping [5,6] . The thus obtained yttrium-doped BMG, (Zr 0.51 Cu 0.207 Ni 0.12 Al 0.163 ) 99.5 Y 0.5 , shows a high GFA ( T rg = 0.633), high glass transition temperature ( T g = 725 K) and high fracture strength ( σ f = 2.04 GPa). However, for this material to be practically useful, it is necessary to investigate its thermal stability as well as the crystallization mechanism when subjected to thermal exposure. In this study, annealing induced crystallization behavior of the (Zr 0.51 Cu 0.207 Ni 0.12 Al 0.163 ) 99.5 Y 0.5 alloy is investigated by TEM and other structural characterization techniques. Thermal stability, crystallization mode and solid state phase transformation in the crystallization process have been discussed. 2 Experimental An alloy with a nominal composition of (Zr 0.51 Cu 0.207 Ni 0.12 Al 0.163 ) 99.5 Y 0.5 was fabricated in Ф3 mm samples. These samples were prepared by the non-consumed arc melting and copper mold casting techniques. During the fabrication, raw materials were melted at least four times to ensure the compositional homogeneity and high purity argon was used as the protective atmosphere. Thermal analysis was performed on a Perkin–Elmer Pyris I differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) machine. Fig. 1 shows a DSC curve with a heating rate of 0.167 K/s for the as-cast alloy, in which T g (=725 K) and T x (=802 K) are marked by arrows. It is noted that there is a second peak on the DSC curve at the temperature of about 904 K (referred as T s ), which might correspond to a solid state phase transformation [7] . Based on these characteristic temperatures, the annealing temperatures were designed at 673 K (sub- T g temperature), 723 K (near- T g temperature), 773 K (in the super-cooled liquid region) and at two higher temperatures of 873 and 923 K. Isothermal annealing experiments were also performed at these temperatures with a holding time of 30 min to investigate the response of the microstructure to the isothermal treatment. Annealing treatments were conducted in a nitrogen gas protected furnace with the heating rate of 0.167 K/s, followed by quenching to room temperature. The annealed samples were characterized using TEM, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and DSC. TEM investigation was carried out on a 200 kV Tecnai F20. XRD study was performed on a D/max IIIA diffractometer with a Cu Kα target operated at 40 kV and 60 mA. TEM specimens were prepared by electro-polishing method using a chemical solution of 5% H 2 SO 4 + 95% methanol. The ImageJ software was used to do the image analysis of the obtained TEM images in terms of the crystal size and volume fraction of the crystalline phases. 3 Results 3.1 Primary crystallization Fig. 2 (a) presents the XRD patterns for the as-cast and annealed alloys, where 673 K – 0 min, 673 K – 30 min, 723 K – 0 min, 723 K – 30 min and 773 K – 0 min denote the corresponding annealing temperatures and times. The alloys do not show any significant crystallization even after annealing at 773 K, as evidenced by the diffuse peaks in these XRD curves. Fig. 3 shows the TEM bright-field images of the alloys with inserted corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns. In consistent with the XRD results, one can see that the amorphous phase dominates the microstructure in these alloys with a very small fraction (<2%) of nano-sized (10–30 nm) crystalline phases in the annealed alloys. To clarify the crystal structure of the particles present in these annealed alloys, extensive SAED studies have been carried out and the results show that these nano-scaled crystals have the same crystal structure with large lattice parameters (referred as LL phase hereafter). Fig. 4 (a) shows a high resolution image of a representative primary phase and its SAED pattern (inset). Since this LL phase can be determined to be one of the final crystallization products, its detailed structure specification will be discussed in detail later on. EDS analysis, shown in Fig. 4 (b), indicates that the primary crystalline phase contains an increased Cu concentration and a decreased Zr concentration when compared with the composition of the amorphous matrix. At the same time, no noticeable compositional change can be detected for the Al and Ni elements. 3.2 High temperature crystallization and solid state phase transformation Significant crystallization can be observed in the alloys isothermally annealed for 30 min at the temperature of 773 K or in the alloys continuously heated up to 873 K, as evidenced by the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 2 (b). It is of interest to note that the XRD patterns for the 773 K-30 min and 873 K-0 min alloys show two main peaks while more peaks can be seen for the 873 K-30 min, 923 K-0 min and 923 K-30 min alloys, in which one of the main peaks (at∼36.5°) that belongs to the 773 K-30 min and 873 K-0 min alloys disappears. Based on these, one can realize that phase transformation is involved in this period of crystallization and this transformation should be completed either when annealed at 923 K or with a 30 min isothermal treatment at 873 K, as evidenced by the almost identical XRD patterns for the 873 K-30 min, 923 K-0 min and 923 K-30 min alloys. Fig. 5 presents the TEM bright-field images with inserted corresponding SAED patterns, showing the general morphology of the 773 K-30 min ( Fig. 5 (a)) and 873 K-0 min ( Fig. 5 (b)) alloys. Extensive SAED studies suggest that there are only two types of crystalline phases associated with these two alloys, including the LL phase that appears in the low temperature annealed alloys as the primary phase. Interestingly, some of the LL structured phases have grown to a relatively large size, associated with twin structures, as shown in  Fig. 5 (b). Detailed structural analysis of these twin structures suggests that this phase has a similar crystal structure with a tetragonal phase discovered by de Oliveira et al. in an annealed Zr 55 Al 10 Ni 5 Cu 30 alloy [8] . Through careful TEM analysis, we determine the lattice parameters of this LL phase to be a = 0.96 nm and c = 2.82 nm. In addition, the chemical composition of this phase is determined as Zr 47.5 Cu 29.6 Ni 13.0 Al 9.9 by averaging multiple TEM EDS analysis results. Fig. 6 shows a TEM bright-field image of the other crystalline phase and its corresponding SAED patterns (insets) along different zone axes. The crystal structure of this phase is indexed to be orthorhombic with lattice parameters of a = 0.69 nm, b = 0.75 nm and c = 0.74 nm. This crystal phase was also detected in similar Zr-based BMGs [6] , whose precipitation was accompanied by the fcc structured NiZr 2 that was believed to be a metastable phase in certain circumstances [9] . For the 873 K-30 min, 923 K-0 min and 923 K-30 min alloys, Fig. 7 (a)–(c) shows their general morphologies with the corresponding inserted SAED patterns. It can be seen that the nano-crystallization is realized in these high temperature annealed alloys, and the crystal size of most of the phases is in the scale of tens of nanometres. Extensive SAED investigation suggests that there are three crystalline phases in these alloys. Apart from the above-mentioned primary crystalline phase, two crystalline phases are observed and their TEM images and corresponding SAED patterns are given in Fig. 7 (d) and (e), respectively. The phase shown in Fig. 7 (d) has a tetragonal structure with the lattice parameters of a = 1.59 nm and c = 1.13 nm, which is close to the primitive tetragonal Zr 2 Cu phase while the phase shown in Fig. 7 (e) has a tetragonal structure with the lattice parameters of a = 0.32 nm and c = 1.12 nm, which is close to the body-centered tetragonal Zr 2 Cu phase. Interestingly, the orthorhombic phase existing in the lower temperature annealed alloys disappears in these alloys, suggesting it to be a metastable phase. It is then clear that, when the annealing treatments are carried out at higher temperatures, the solid state phase transformation takes place from the orthorhombic metastable phase to these two tetragonal crystalline phases. 4 Discussion 4.1 Primary crystallization and thermal stability According to the above TEM (together with EDS) studies, the averaged size and volume fraction of the primary phases as a function of the annealing temperature as well as the holding time are shown in Fig. 8 (a); the composition variation of the primary phase in these alloys is shown in Fig. 8 (b). From Fig. 8 , it is clearly seen that the alloy in this study shows a nano-scaled primary crystallization with two characters: low nucleation rate (volume fraction from ∼0.5% to ∼2%) and low growth rate (averaged crystal size from ∼25 to ∼35 nm), combined with a slight increment in Zr concentration and decrease in Cu concentration when isothermal treatments are performed. Based on the current understanding, nano-scaled primary crystallization requires either the phase decomposition prior to the crystallization [10] or the existence of localized orders [11] . Considering that the crystal size of the primary phases in our alloy is larger than the short range orders or medium range orders [12] , the phase decomposition is more likely to be the reason for the nucleation/formation of these nano-scaled primary phases. Since the relative content of Zr and Cu is changed during the isothermal treatment, the inter-diffusion of Zr and Cu between the primary phases and the amorphous matrix should be responsible for the growth of these phases. Considering that Zr and Cu have relatively large atomic radius, the diffusivity should be slow, which will restrict the diffusion and hence limit the growth of the primary phase. The fact that the amorphous phase dominates the microstructure of the alloy annealed below the temperature of 773 K also indicates that this alloy has a good thermal stability when compared with some well-known Zr-based BMGs. For example, Zr 41.2 Ti 13.8 Ni 10 Cu 12.5 Be 22.5 and Zr 65 Cu 15 Ni 10 Al 10 alloys have crystallized up to 30% [13] and 100% [14] , respectively, when annealed at 723 K. In strong contrast, the alloy in this study has only ∼1% crystallization under the identical annealing condition. 4.2 Solid state phase transformation and crystallization sequence The appearance and disappearance of the orthorhombic phase when the alloy (Zr 0.51 Al 0.163 Ni 0.12 Cu 0.207 ) 99.5 Y 0.5 is annealed at different conditions indicate strongly that this orthorhombic phase is a metastable phase. Since metastable phases, in general, have a smaller surface energy [15] , their nucleation should become easier, which can result in a high nucleation rate. As high nucleation rate and low growth rate are necessary conditions for the nano-crystallization, it is reasonable to believe that the formation of metastable phases is the reason for the nano-crystallization in these high temperature annealed alloys. To give a quantitative evaluation of the nucleation and growth process, the activation energy for the nucleation and growth of the present alloy is studied via thermal analysis. Fig. 9 presents the DSC analysis results, from which the values of E n (activation energy for nucleation) and E g (activation energy for growth) can be determined to be ∼357.6 kJ/mol and ∼265.4 kJ/mol, respectively, by the method suggested by Lu et al. [16] . Compared with one of the famous Zr-based BMGs [17] , the nucleation activation energy of the present alloy is smaller and the growth activation energy is larger, corresponding to a high nucleation rate and a low growth rate and consistent with the TEM analysis results. On the other hand, as discussed above, we have determined that the primary phase in the temperature region of 673–773 K is a tetragonal structured LL phase; after 30 min isothermal treatment at 773 K or at higher annealing temperature of 873 K, an orthorhombic structured crystal appears together with the LL phase; and then this orthorhombic structured phase transforms into two tetragonal structured crystalline phases; in the end, the LL phase and these two tetragonal structured crystalline phases compose the final crystallization products. The whole crystallization process can be summarized as the schematic graph shown in Fig. 10 . 5 Conclusions (1) The primary phase formed in the crystallization process of the (Zr 0.51 Cu 0.207 Ni 0.12 Al 0.163 ) 99.5 Y 0.5 alloy is determined to be a large lattice parameter phase with a = 0.96 nm and c = 2.82 nm. (2) During the crystallization process of the (Zr 0.51 Cu 0.207 Ni 0.12 Al 0.163 ) 99.5 Y 0.5 alloy, a solid state phase transformation is involved between the metastable phase (orthorhombic structure with a = 0.69 nm, b = 0.75 nm and c = 0.74 nm) and two stable tetragonal phases ( a = 1.59 nm and c = 1.13 nm; a = 0.322 nm and c = 1.118 nm). (3) Nano-crystallization is realized in the high temperature annealed alloys with nucleation and growth activation energies of about 358 kJ/mol and 265 kJ/mol, respectively. (4) The general crystallization process of the (Zr 0.51 Cu 0.207 Ni 0.12 Al 0.163 ) 99.5 Y 0.5 alloy with increasing annealing temperature or time can be summarized as follows: amorphous phase → amorphous phase + primary LL phase → primary LL phase + (orthorhombic metastable phase + LL phase) → primary LL phase + (LL phase + primitive and body-centered tetragonal phases).

It was found that the obtained Fe-based coating with about 300 μm in thickness showed fully amorphous state and possessed low porosity. Moreover, the Fe-based coating exhibited better corrosion resistance than 921A navy steel and Ti-6Al-4V alloy in aggressive H 2SO 4 solutions.

        "abstract": "Abstract   The purpose of this study was to identify plastic flow behavior and microstructural evolution during sub-transus hot deformation of a Ti-6Al-4V alloy with three initial microstructures (namely, transformed β microstructure, bimodal microstructure, and α′ martensitic microstructure) through compressive deformation at different strain rates in a Gleeble simulator and via SEM and TEM examinations. When deformed at a temperature of 800 °C and 850 °C (below the beta transus temperature of ∼975 °C), samples with a transformed β microstructure exhibited globularization of lamellar α phase at a strain rate of 10 −3  s −1 , while adiabatic shear banding occurred at a strain rate above 10 −3  s −1  due to the presence of initial coarse β grains. Equiaxed grain microstructures were present after hot deformation in the samples containing a bimodal starting microstructure mainly at lower strain rates, and in the samples with an α′ martensitic starting microstructure at all strain rates from 10 −3  s −1  to 1 s −1 . Especially, a homogenous ultra-fine grained structure with an average grain size of 400 nm was achieved at both deformation temperatures at a strain rate of 1 s −1  in the case of α′ martensitic starting microstructure. The new ultra-fine grains were formed mainly through the phase transformation of α′/α+β and the subsequent continuous dynamic recrystallization during hot deformation. This opens the door to the development of homogenous ultrafine-grained structure from a fully martensitic initial microstructure via hot deformation (e.g., hot rolling, extrusion, forging).",

Altered lncRNA levels can affect the expression of gene products. There are seldom studies on the role of lncRNAs in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Quantitative RT-PCR showed that DQ786243 was significantly overexpressed in clinical active CD patients compared with clinical inactive CD patients (P = 0.0118) or healthy controls (P = 0.002). CREB was also more highly expressed in active CD than in inactive CD (P = 0.0034) or controls (P = 0.0241). Foxp3 was interestingly lower in inactive CD than in active CD (P = 0.0317) or controls (P = 0.0103), but there were no apparent differences between active CD and controls. CRP was well correlated with DQ786243 (r = 0.489, P = 0.034), CREB (r = 0.500, P = 0.029) and Foxp3 (r = 0.546, P = 0.016). At 48 hours after DQ786243 transfection, qRT-PCR showed both CREB (P = 0.017) and Foxp3 (P = 0.046) had an increased mRNA expression in Jurkat cells. Western blot showed the same pattern. After DQ786243 transfection, CREB phosphorylation ratio (p-CREB/t-CREB) was increased (P = 0.0043).DQ786243 can be related with severity of CD. It can affect the expression of CREB and Foxp3 through which regulates the function of Treg. CREB itself seems not the mediator of DQ786243 to up-regulate Foxp3. The phosphorylation of CREB might play a more important role in the process.",

        "abstract": "Background: Perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA) and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) are immunoglobulins closely related with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The role of pANCA and ASCA in the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) remains further verification. Aims: To investigate the significance of pANCA and ASCA in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of UC and CD. Methods: Serum samples were obtained from 64 patients with UC, 62 patients with CD and 56 healthy controls. Levels and positivity rates of pANCA and ASCA were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of pANCA, ASCA and their combination were analyzed. Results: Serum pANCA level was significantly higher in UC group than that in CD group and healthy controls [(584.22±347.70) pg/ml vs. (304.99±211.10) pg/ml and (390.92±82.82) pg/ml, P<0.01], so was the positivity rate of pANCA (50.0% vs. 14.5% and 14.3%, P<0.01). The level and positivity rate of serum ASCA among these three groups had no significant difference. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of pANCA+ and pANCA+/ASCA- in diagnosis of UC were 50.0%, 85.7%, 80.0%, 60.0% and 42.2%, 89.3%, 81.8%, 57.5%, respectively, and those of ASCA+ and ASCA+/pANCA- in diagnosis of CD were 8.1%, 87.5%, 41.7%, 46.2% and 3.2%, 91.1%, 28.6%, 45.9%, respectively. Conclusions: Positive pANCA favors the diagnosis of UC. Detection of pANCA together with ASCA is helpful for the differential diagnosis of UC, but is not of high value for the diagnosis of CD.",

        "abstract": "With advances in automatic position sensing and wireless connectivity, location-based services (LBS) are rapidly developing, particularly in fields of geographic, tourism and logistic information systems. Currently, Web service has been viewed as one of most significant innovations in business industry, and designed on demand to provide spatial related information for LBS consumption. However, the traditional Web Service Description Language (WSDL) cannot meet those requirements, as WSDL is not able to support semantic content and information. In recent years, Ontology came up with an effective approach to enhance service description, automated discovery, dynamic composition, enactment, and other tasks such as managing and using service-based systems. In this paper, we propose geographic ontology based on Geography Markup Language (GML) and extend OWL-S profile to form geographic profile. Web service, which is advertised on the basis of our GeoProfile, contains geographic information inherently.",

Setch],glycosaminoglycan from Pinctada margaritifera and peptidoglycan from Sepia on the immune response to Newcastle disease(ND) vaccine in chickens.Methods: Amylose extracts injections were respectively mixed with ND vaccine to form three variant ND vaccine injection and stabilities of the mixtures were all tested.And amylose extracts powders were respectively mixed in the feed for chicken to eat.All groups were received intramuscularly inoculation administration.Respectively on the 7th,14th and 21st days after vaccine administration,sera samples of all chickens were collected to detect the antibody titers by hemagglutination inhibition(HI) assay method.Results: In the amylose powder feed groups,the ND HI titers belonged to the 14th day in the peptidoglycan and alga polysaccharide sulfate groups were obviously higher than those in the control group(P<0.05),and the value belonged to the 21st day in the alga polysaccharide sulfate group were still obviously higher than that in the control group(P<0.05).The ND HI titers belonged to the 14th and 21st days in the alga polysaccharide sulfate(50 mg/kg BW dosage)group were obviously higher than those in the control group(P<0.05).The ND HI titers belonged to the 7th,14th and 21st days in the alga polysaccharide sulfate(100 mg/kg BW dosage)group were obviously higher or markedly obviously higher than those in the control group(P<0.05,or P<0.01).Conclusions: These results showed that by the way of either injection or feed,the alga polysaccharide sulfate could improve chicken's immune response,and the effects generate quickly and could keep a long time.These suggest it should be a good immune enhancing adjuvant.",

        "abstract": "Micro Learning through open educational resources (OERs) is becoming increasingly popular. However, adaptive micro learning support remains inadequate by current OER platforms. To address this, our smart system, Micro Learning as a Service (MLaaS), aims to deliver personalized OER with micro learning to satisfy their real-time needs. In this paper, we focus on constructing a knowledge base to support the decision-making process of MLaaS. MLaas is built using a top-down approach. A conceptual graph-based ontology construction is first developed. An educational data mining and learning analytic strategy is then proposed for the data level. The learning resource adaptation still requires learners’ historical information. To compensate for the absence of this information initially (aka ‘cold start’), we set up a predictive ontology-based mechanism. As the first resource is delivered to the beginning of a learner’s learning journey, the micro OER recommendation is also optimized using a tailored heuristic.",

Using the original Mamdani fuzzy rule based system (FRBS), an adaptive Mamdani fuzzy modeling (AMFM) is introduced in this paper. It differs from the original Mamdani FRBS in that it applies different membership functions and a denazification mechanism that is `differentiable' with respect to the membership function parameters. The proposed system also includes a back error propagation (BEP) algorithm that is used to refine the fuzzy model. The efficacy of the proposed AMFM approach is demonstrated through the experimental trails from a compressor in an industrial gas turbine system.",

The compressive fracture strength, elastic strain to fracture, Young's modulus and Vickers hardness were measured to be 3.5 GPa, 1.5%, 265 GPa, and 1253 kg mm-2, respectively. The fracture mode of the glassy alloy under uniaxial compression is different from those of other bulk metallic glasses in that this fracture mode causes the samples to be broken, in an exploding manner, into a large number of micrometer-scale pieces. The fracture mechanisms of this bulk glassy alloy under bending and uniaxial compression are discussed based on the observation of the fracture surfaces. Vickers indentation tests indicate that the structure of the glassy ingot may be inhomogencous. © 2007 Materials Research Society.",

Our deduplication storage system, which manages data and duplication over the cloud system, consists of two major components, a front-end deduplication application and a mass storage system as back-end. Hadoop distributed file system HDFS is a common distribution file system on the cloud, which is used with Hadoop database HBase. We use HDFS to build up a mass storage system and employ HBase to build up a fast indexing system. With a deduplication application, a scalable and parallel deduplicated cloud storage system can be effectively built up. We further use VMware to generate a simulated cloud environment. The simulation results demonstrate that our deduplication storage system is sufficiently accurate and efficient for distributed and cooperative data intensive engineering applications.",

The negative tone gel film was irradiated with high pressure mercury lamp through the mask and then leached in ethyl alcohol.

        "abstract": "Active faults in soft sediments usually do not have distinct macroscopic appearance, forming so-called obscured faults.Therefore, active faults in soft sediments cannot be identified thoroughly through macroscopic observations of trenches or natural outcrops across the faults.Obviously, it is necessary to develop a new method for the identification of active faults in soft sediments.An attempt to identify active faults in soft sediments through microscopic observations has been made in this study.For this purpose, a total of 24 trenches and natural outcrops across the Shunyi-Qianmen-Liangxiang Fault in Beijing, Jiaocheng Fault in Taiyuan, Wangjiagou and Xishan Faults in rümqi, and Lintong-Chang'an Fault in Xi'an have been observed.During the observations, 140 samples were collected by using sampling boxes to preserve their original state, from which 275 large thin sections were cut in the lab, and 122 samples of dispersed particles were also collected at the same position.Microstructural, micro-sedimentologic and SEM observations were carried out on all the samples collected.The results show that the obscured faults in soft sediments can be identified distinctly under microscope.Microscopically, they may appear as slip surfaces, deformation bands, zone of deformation bands, relatively wide micro-fault zones, micro-shutter zones, filled tension cracks, zones of concentrated clastic grain and zones of concentrated ferruginous materials or organics.The angularity, grain-size, grain-size distribution and surface textures of the clastic grains from the samples collected on the fault plane and outside are significantly different.Microstructural observations have revealed several microstructures comparable well with macroscopic structures indicative of seismites, such as balls-and-pillows structure, load structure, fluid flow, mass flow, truncation surface and floatation of organics.Obviously, the afore-mentioned microstructural and micro-sedimentologic features can be used as the microscopic indicators of obscured faults in soft sediments, as well as for the indicators of whether the faulting process is accompanied by seismic event.The results of this study, therefore, indicate that microscopic observation is an effective approach to the identification of active faults in soft sediments.",

In addition, 5 × 10(5) unlabeled NSCs (n = 21) and vehicle alone (n = 21) subjects were injected as a control. Serial MRI was performed with a 1.5-T scanner to determine the distribution of grafted cells. Sequential T1 and T2 values of the nerves and functional recovery were measured over a 70-day follow-up period, with histologic assessments performed at regular intervals.The distribution and migration of labeled NSCs could be tracked with MRI until 10 days after transplantation. Compared with vehicle control, nerves grafted with labeled or unlabeled NSCs had better functional recovery and showed improved nerve regeneration but exhibited a sustained increase of T1 and T2 values during the phase of regeneration.Gadopentetate dimeglumine-based labeling allowed short-term in vivo MRI tracking of NSCs grafted in injured nerves. NSCs transplantation could promote nerve regeneration in acute peripheral nerve traction injury as shown by a prolonged increase of nerve T1 and T2 values.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we proposed a theoretical model for one-dimensional semiconductor nanowires (NWs), taking account of the defect-related electrical transport process. The maximum emission current density was calculated by considering the influence of Joule heating, using a one-dimensional heat equation. The field emission properties of individual CuO NWs with different electrical properties were studied using an in situ experimental technique. The experimental results for maximum emission current density agreed well with the theoretical predictions and suggested that multiple conduction mechanisms were active. These may be induced by the concentration of defects in the CuO NW. The concentration of defects and the transport mechanisms were found to be key factors influencing the maximum field emission current density of the semiconductor NW. As is limited by the change of resistivity with temperature, only thermal runaway can trigger breakdown in CuO NWs.",

The main characteristics and the classifications of P2P systems are discussed. Considering the requirements of P2P application modeling and referring to the component-based modeling thought, a description method based on communicating sequential processes (CSP) is proposed for the P2P network models. By using a CSP process group, this method can describe the dynamic interactive relationship which focuses on multiparty concurrent interaction of P2P systems more advantageously and accurately. The application of nondeterministic semantemes of CSP in describing the interactive relationship of P2P networks is discussed. The advantages and description abilities of the proposed method are demonstrated through the modeling of a new P2P media-on-demand system. Copyright.",

The aim of this study is to determine whether clustering analysis of protein expression profiles in intestinal epithelia improves classification and prognosis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). One hundred and twenty Crohn's disease (CD) patients, 117 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and 120 cases of nonspecific colitis provided intestinal biopsy samples for tissue microarray (TMA). Both unsupervised and supervised analyses were used for evaluation of clustering and association with relapse. There was a significant concordance between cluster groups based on immunostaining data of TMA and clinical classification in distinguishing IBD from nonspecific colitis (kappa= 0.498, p<0.001). CD27, CD70, CD40, TRAF3, TRAF4 and TRAF2 presented similar immunostaining features, which were different from clusters of CD154, CD80 and TRAF5. Moreover, higher expression of TRAF2 was a predictor of relapse in patients with UC (p=0.006).Thus, protein expression profiles can distinguish IBD and nonspecific colitis, and combination analysis protein expression profiles show that TRAF2 can predict relapse of UC.",

With reflective spectroscopic ellipsometry, the ellipsometric parameters Ψ and Δ of TiO_2 films were measured. Then, with the Cauchy model, the ellipsometric data were fitted, and both the thickness and the optical constants at 380—800 nm wavelength of the films were obtained. A comparison was made between the reflectance of the films derived with the spectrophotometer and the simulated results. Meanwhile, the thickness of the films was calculated by interference method. Moreover, with the atomic force microscopy the surface microstructures of the films annealed at different temperatures were observed, and the relationship between the surface microstructures and optical constants of films was further discussed. The results showed that Cauchy model works well in describing the dispersion relationship of the TiO_2 films, and the variation rules of optical constants (the refractive index, the extinction coefficient) with wavelength were obtained. The optical constants of the films were related with the microstructure. Those simulated reflectance spectrum accorded well with the measured result. And with a deviation of only 2.5%, the calculated value of the thickness was in accordance with which was obtained by spectroscopic ellipsometry.",

        "title": "A new criterion for evaluating the glass-forming ability of bulk metallic glasses",
        "abstract": "A new criterion, derived according to the classical theory of nucleation and growth and the perspective of phase transformation kinetics, has been proposed for evaluating the glass-forming ability (GFA) of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) by measuring the characteristic thermal parameters. A survey of the readily available experimental data associated with the thermal analysis of various BMG alloys show that the new criterion, defined as δ = T x /( T l − T g ) (where T g , T x and T l denote the glass transition temperature, the onset of crystallization temperature and the liquidus temperature, respectively), is distinctly better than other currently used criteria, such as γ (= T x /( T l + T g )) and T rg (= T g / T l ) in reflecting the GFA, which implies that the δ criterion has a much better interrelationship with GFA than γ and T rg . It is also demonstrated that the δ criterion has, exclusively, a strong ability to measure and predict the GFA of industrially important BMGs based on common metals, such as Cu and Fe. Keywords Criterion Glass-forming ability Bulk metallic glasses Thermal analysis 1 Introduction The glass-forming ability (GFA) of an alloy, as a measure of the ease of vitrification, reflects the physical nature of the alloy and indicates whether the alloy is a candidate for glass formation in bulk forms using conventional casting processes, and therefore, is a very important parameter in designing and developing new bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) with unique mechanical properties or other attributes. To date, various empirical parameters have been proposed to assess the GFA of BMGs [1–8] . Among these GFA indicators, T rg [1] and γ [6,7] are the most widely used, since these two parameters can be easily determined from thermal analysis, and show a reasonable correlation with the GFA for various BMGs. However, accumulated data show that both T rg and γ cannot, in many cases, properly reflect the GFA tendency of BMGs, as indicated in the following text. From the viewpoint of physical metallurgy, the most direct and quantifiable GFA indicator of an alloy is the critical cooling rate, R c , which is the minimum cooling rate required to allow the alloy melt to be cast into a bulk glass. However, it is very difficult to obtain the R c value of an alloy as this has to be determined by time-consuming experimentation or heat transfer calculations. On the other hand, another slightly less direct but quantifiable parameter is the maximum section thickness or diameter, D max , of a plate- or rod-like BMG sample, which can be obtained by casting the alloy using a slow-cooling process. Although D max is easier to obtain than R c , tedious experiments are still unavoidable to determine D max for each alloy composition. Therefore, it is vital to find a simple and more effective criterion for evaluating the GFA of BMGs. Recently, we proposed a new criterion for evaluating the GFA of BMGs [9] . The new criterion was deduced based mainly on the classical theory of nucleation and growth. In this paper, we extend the discussion on the origin of the new GFA parameter by coupling the perspective of phase transformation kinetics. The validity and feasibility of the new criterion in measuring the GFA of BMG alloys are elucidated by examining how well its values correlate with the glass formation tendency in various BMG forming systems, in comparison with other GFA indicators, such as T rg and γ . 2 Origin of the new criterion It has been well recognized that the pre-requisite for formation of a metallic glass is that the nucleation rate and growth rate of the crystalline phases should be sufficiently low to hinder the formation of crystals during cooling of an alloy melt down to the glass transition temperature, T g . Based on classical nucleation and growth theory, the homogenous nucleation rate, I , and the growth rate, U , of a crystalline phase formed from an undercooled liquid can be expressed by [10] : (1) I = 10 30 η exp − 16 π 3 α 3 Δ S f T 2 R ( T l − T ) 2 ; (2) U = 10 2 f η 1 − exp − Δ S f ( T l − T ) R T , where η is the viscosity, ƒ the fraction of nucleation sites at the growth interface, α a factor which depends on the atomic arrangement at the interface and has a value close to unity, Δ S f the change in entropy per mole of alloy due to melting, T the temperature of the melt and R is the universal gas constant. As clearly shown in Eqs. (1) and (2) , the nucleation and growth rates of a crystalline phase at a given temperature are controlled mainly by three parameters: η , Δ S f and T /( T l − T ), and are inversely proportional to these parameters. On the other hand, the GFA of an alloy is inversely proportional to the nucleation rate and growth rate of the crystalline phases, which tend to form during cooling. As a result, the GFA of the alloy is proportional to η , Δ S f and T /( T l − T ). For alloys, which consist mainly of metallic elements, ΔS f does not change significantly from one alloy to another [10] , thus it can be assumed to be a constant for simplicity. Therefore, the important parameters controlling the GFA of an alloy are reduced to be η and T /( T l − T ). Considering the glass formation occurs at T g , and the GFA of an alloy melt is proportional to the reciprocals of I and U , we can have (3) GFA ∝ T g T l − T g . To examine the dependence of GFA on the viscosity, η , of an alloy melt, we consider the effect of η on the shape of the time–temperature–transformation (TTT) curve for formation of a crystalline phase. From Eqs. (1) and (2) , we can see that a larger η means a smaller pre-exponential term and less sensitivity of I and U to temperature. This corresponds to the fact that the crystallization of the alloy with a larger η will be retarded and consequently, the nose of the TTT curve becomes blunter and the whole curve shifts to the right, as shown schematically in Fig. 1 . This corresponds to a lower R c and thus a higher GFA, in agreement with the above analysis. Furthermore, the crystallization temperature, T x , of the glass subjected to heating, is determined by the point of intersection of the heating curve and the TTT curve (see Fig. 1 ). The change of the shape of the TTT curve, and the shift of the curve to the right, also correspond to a larger ( T x − T g ) value, as shown in Fig. 1 . This implies that the magnitude of ( T x − T g ) reflects the effect of the viscosity of the supercooled liquid on the GFA of an alloy. Although ( T x − T g ) itself has been proven to be by no means a reliable GFA indicator [6,11–13] , it can be clearly seen from Fig. 1 that a higher ( T x − T g ) value indeed correlates with a lower R c and hence a higher GFA. In an effort to apply this relationship to a wide range of BMG alloys with different glass transition temperatures and liquid viscosities to obtain a dimensionless criterion, the parameter ( T x − T g ) can be normalized with respect to T g , resulting in ( T x − T g )/ T g = T x / T g − 1. Thereby, it can be noticed that the GFA of an alloy is proportional to T x / T g , i.e., (4) GFA ∝ T x T g . By combining Eqs. (3) and (4) , a new expression, which links the GFA of an alloy with its characteristic thermal temperatures T g , T x and T l , can be deduced as follows: (5) GFA ∝ T g T l − T g × T x T g = T x T l − T g . Based on Eq. (5) , a new criterion for evaluating the GFA of an alloy, which is called the δ criterion, is defined by: (6) δ = T x T l − T g . 3 Evaluation of the new criterion 3.1 Statistical analysis To examine the advantages of the new criterion presented in this study over other GFA parameters ( T rg and γ ), calculations of T rg , γ and δ , were made on the basis of the available experimental data of the characteristic temperatures of various reported BMGs. Table 1 presents the T g , T x , T l , D max and the calculated T rg , γ and δ for the already reported BMGs based on Cu [14,15] , Y [16] , Ca [17] , Mg [18–22] , Zr [11,23–25] , La [18,19,26,27] , Pd [18,19,28–31] , Ti [32,33] and Ce [34] . All compositions herein are expressed in atomic percent. Since the maximum thickness, D max , of as-cast glassy samples attainable through conventional metallurgical routes is the decisive criterion for measuring the GFA of BMGs, the values of T rg , γ and δ should follow the varying trend of D max when these parameters are believed to measure the GFA, i.e., the larger the D max , the higher the GFA parameters should be. Figs. 2–4 show the plots of D max against δ , γ and T rg , respectively, for those previously reported BMG alloys listed in Table 1 . Apparently, all GFA indicators exhibit a proportional relationship with respect to the maximum thickness, D max , indicating that all these parameters can, to a certain extent, reflect the GFA of the alloys. However, by referring to the values of R 2 , which is the regression coefficient, statistically reflecting how strong the linear correlation is, one can see that δ has the strongest ability in representing the GFA, since the value of R 2 corresponding to the D max − δ plot is the highest among all parameters. It can be concluded that our new criterion, δ , is a better GFA indicator than T rg and γ . 3.2 Application in BMGs based on common metals Recently, studies of BMGs based on common metals, such as Cu [14,15,36–39] and Fe [40–46] have received particular attention due to the distinct interest in engineering applications. Inoue et al. [47] developed ternary CuHfTi BMG alloys starting from a binary Cu 60 Hf 40 alloy. The maximum diameters of the glassy rods can increase from 1.0 mm for the Cu 60 Hf 40 alloy to 4.0 mm or above for the Cu 60 Hf 25 Ti 15 or Cu 60 Hf 20 Ti 20 alloys. The measured thermal parameters and calculated γ and δ values for these alloys are presented in Table 2 . The T rg for Cu 60 Hf 25 Ti 15 alloy is less than 0.62, as shown in Fig. 5(b) of ref. [47] . Therefore, compared to the Cu 60 Hf 25 Ti 15 alloy, the Cu 60 Hf 20 Ti 20 alloy has a lower T l and higher T rg spontaneously, indicating that the melt of the Cu 60 Hf 20 Ti 20 alloy is more stable against crystallization upon solidification, allowing a larger GFA. Considering that the 4.0 mm casting sample of the Cu 60 Hf 25 Ti 15 alloy has been confirmed to be mostly amorphous, see Fig. 6 in ref. [47] , the attainable D max for the Cu 60 Hf 20 Ti 20 alloy should be larger than 4.0 mm. By referring to Table 2 , one can conclude that the GFA of the three alloys increases in the order of Cu 60 Hf 40 , Cu 60 Hf 25 Ti 15 and Cu 60 Hf 20 Ti 20 . The values of δ and T rg increase, exactly following this order. The γ values, however, do not vary in the same order. This means that, δ , as well as T rg , but not γ , can precisely reflect the effect of Ti concentration on the GFA of the present Cu-based alloys. Inoue et al. [44] examined the effect of Co substitution for Fe on the GFA of the [(Fe 1− x Co x ) 0.75 B 0.2 Si 0.05 ] 96 Nb 4 ( x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5) alloys prepared by using the copper-mold casting. It was found that the alloys with higher Co concentration exhibited a unique combination of high GFA and super-high strength of over 4000 MPa. The thermal parameters, the maximum sample diameters and the calculated GFA parameters of the cast [(Fe 1− x Co x ) 0.75 B 0.2 Si 0.05 ] 96 Nb 4 glassy alloy rods are also given in Table 2 . With increasing the content of Co, the GFA of the series of alloys increases, evidenced by the increase in the maximum sample diameters. The GFA trend with the compositions can be perfectly reflected and predicted by the δ criterion. T rg also shows a reasonable correlation with the GFA. But evidently T rg is not as good as δ in representing the GFA. The alloys with x = 0.3 and 0.4, for example, have the same values of T rg , their GFAs, however, are slightly different, as indicated by the respective D max value. In contrast, γ cannot properly reflect the GFA for these alloys. For the alloys with x = 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5, the values of γ are almost equal to each other (0.392), conflicting with the fact that the GFA for these three alloys is obviously different. In other words, among all GFA parameters used in this study, δ proves to be the best in judging the GFA of the sequential Fe-based BMG alloys. Very recently, the present authors investigated the GFA of the Fe 48− x Co x Cr 15 Mo 14 Y 2 C 15 B 6 ( x = 0, 3, 5, 7, 9) alloys, and found that the Fe 41 Co 7 Cr 15 Mo 14 Y 2 C 15 B 6 alloy had an extraordinary GFA, enabling formation of a large glassy ingot with a critical casting size of at least 16 mm, which is the largest value among all Fe-based BMGs reported to date [46] . The thermal parameters, the maximum sample diameters and calculated GFA parameters of the cast Fe 48− x Co x Cr 15 Mo 14 Y 2 C 15 B 6 ( x = 0, 3, 5, 7, 9) alloys are also listed in Table 2 . It is readily apparent that the new parameter, δ , correlates well with the GFA of the alloys. The alloy with the largest glassy sample diameter, and thus the highest GFA, has the largest δ value, while the Co free alloy with much poorer GFA has a much lower δ value, indicating that δ can effectively and reliably reflect the GFA as a function of Co content. Similarly, T rg also correlates well with the GFA trend. In comparison, γ shows a poor ability to correctly quantify the GFA of the serial alloys. 4 Conclusions We have developed a new criterion, i.e., δ = T x /( T l − T g ), for evaluating the glass-forming ability of bulk metallic glasses. The reliability and benefits of the new criterion with respect to other parameters have been demonstrated in a wide range of BMG alloys. It should be pointed out that, due to the complexity in the dominant factors governing the formation of multi-component bulk metallic glasses, it is by no means expected to be a universal criterion which can be used to judge and predict the GFA of all BMG alloys. The striking feature of this study, however, is the discovery of the new criterion, which is a simple and reliable GFA measure, as verified in various known BMG alloys. It can be anticipated that the δ criterion will be used as a useful and efficient guideline for exploring new BMG formers. Acknowledgement One of the authors (J.

Although numerous databases have been designed by collecting data either only from literature manually or together with prediction outcomes from computational models, there is currently not a comprehensive data service framework delivering better insights for these results. In this paper, we introduce a biological sequence data service towards delivering deeper insights and helping better biological experiments design. The service includes following major components: a comprehensive database for storing biological data, data analytics tools for analysing biological data, and computational models for delivering testable prediction outcomes. Specifically, we present this service in a framework for studies on host-pathogen interactions. The design of this framework aims to improve the understanding of host-pathogen interactions. The relationships of hierarchical databases and their working mechanism, specifically between PPIs and DDIs, are also presented in this framework. Finally, the preliminary and practical experiences of building computational model for prediction is discussed.",

It was found that field emission current of ��-Fe2O3 nanoflakes decreased with increasing pressure. The field emission current decreased when N2 or O2 was introduced into chamber, while no obvious change was observed for H2 gas. An in-situ thermal treatment was carried out to eradicate the effect of absorbed gas. After the in-situ thermal treatment, the field emission current density was largely enhanced from 60 to 500 ��A/cm2 under applied electrical field of 10 MV/m and the turn on field (Eturn-on) decreased from 7.6 to 5.2 MV/m. The lowered turn-on field was attributed to the decrease of surface work function induced by surface gas desorption and reduction of ��-Fe2O3 nanoflakes. Moreover, the improvement of field emission performance can be retained in high vacuum condition, which indicates the in-situ thermal treatment is an efficient method to improve field emission properties of ��-Fe 2O3 nanoflakes. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

        "title": "Preliminary study of late Quaternary crustal shortening rate along Kuqa depression in south Tianshan, Xinjiang",
        "abstract": "The Kuqa depression is located in the middle segment of the southern Tianshan Mountains. There are four E-W extending rows of reverse fault and anticline zones in the depression. From the south Tianshan Mountains towards the Tarim basin, they are the mountain piedmont, the Kasangtuokai, the Qiulitag and the Yaken reverse fault and fold zones. After a month field working, we find the crustal shortening of the Kuqa depression in late Quaternary is almost caused by the Kasangtuokai, the Qiulitag and the Yaken reverse fault and fold zones. The reverse fault and anticline zones in the Kuqa depression are very-different in tectonic feature. We accurately surveyed these tectonics with total station and differential GPS in order to get a new cognition of the deformation characteristic and the slip rate. Based on the deformation characteristics of conceptual fault-propagation fold and field investigation, we think the deformation of the fault-propagation fold in the Kuqa depression is caused by faulting rather than folding. The crustal shortening rate caused by the fault is approximately near to the actual rate. So we only surveyed the deformation near the fault. The Kasangtuokai anticline is a fault-propagation fold. From late Quaternary, the deformation of Kasangtuokai anticline is mainly caused by total-uplift of the hanging wall. The deformation rate is about 1.0 - 2.0mm/a. The deformation feature of the Dongqiulitag anticline is similar to that of the Kasangtuokai, while the crustal shortening rate is little more than that of Kasangtuokai, about 2.5mm/a. The Qiulitag anticline is a very complicated tectonic. It is a fault-bend fold. There are two reverse faults on the core and the north limb of the Qiulitag anticline. Its tectonic deformation includes two parts: the fold rise and the uplift of the hanging wall of the fault. By surveying and dating, we get the crustal shortening rate of the Qiulitag anticline limb of about 1.06 - 2.0mm/a. Considering the shortening of the core fault and southern limb, the total rate is possibly more than 3.0mm/a. The Yaken anticline is a blind thrust fault-anticline fold. Its shortening rate is 1.5 - 2.0mm/a. So the total crustal shortening rate of the Kuqa depression is more than 5.0 - 7.0mm/a from late Quaternary.",

The result indicated that the influence of end boiling point for density/viscosity was obvious for the distillates with end boiling point <200C and >280C, but not much influence on the distillate with a boiling range of 200-280C. The density of two coal liquefaction oils linearly decreased with the increasing of temperature, and could be regressed as = At + B. The relationship between volume expansion coefficient and the linear coefficient = A/B was also derived. The influence of end boiling point on viscosity was small when the distillates were <300C, but prominent as they were >300C. Viscosity dropped down with the temperature increasing. The viscosity-temperature property of light oil was better than that of medium oil and heavy oil. The relationship between viscosity and temperature conformed to the Andrade correlation. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

The solubility of hydrogen in Shenhua coal liquefied oils (including separated at high-temperature and low-temperature) were conducted at different temperatures (25-350°C) and pressures (2.0-10.0 MPa). The results showed that the solubility of hydrogen increased obviously with increasing of pressures and increased slightly with increasing of temperature.

Immunohistochemistry stain and real-time polymerase chain reaction using oncogenes (BCL-2, c-Myc) and anti-oncogene genes (p53, p21) were performed, serum expressions of tumor marker (CA19-9, CA724 and CA242) were also conducted. MΦ were used to determine their potential role in the carcinogenesis of GBC.BCL-2 and c-Myc expressions gradually increased among CC, XGC and GBC (P = 0.032 and P = 0.020, respectively); while p53 and p21 were similar in the three groups (P = 0.167 and P = 0.122, respectively). Serum BCL-2 and c-Myc were significantly correlated with their tissue levels; in terms of serum tumor markers, which gradually increased among CC, XGC and GBC, however, CA242 and CA724 were both negative in XGC but positive in GBC. Furthermore, gradually increasing MΦ counts were observed among CC, XGC and GBC groups; c-Myc and CA724 were independent predictors for the differentiation of XGC and GBC.XGC is an uncommon inflammatory condition distinct from CC and may be associated with the precancerous nature of GBC for its upregulated oncogenes and MΦ biology. c-Myc and CA724 were independent predictors for the differentiation of XGC and GBC.",

If Q 0 / P m is large, any adjustment to the melt shape will easily cause a variation of the temperature in the melt. In this situation, there appears to be a more sensitive interaction between the shape and the temperature field and a more narrow adjustment range for the process. Experiments on thin plate samples with a cross-section of 6 mm×18 mm are done with two kinds of induction coils. The results show that when a coil with a trumpet inside wall is used and the positions of the melt top and the S/L interface are properly selected, the melt periphery is nearly vertical and the temperature gradient ahead of the S/L interface is high. Under these conditions, a more stable and wider coupling between the shape and the temperature field is continuously maintained and samples with a smooth surface and unidirectional crystals are successfully obtained.

It is found that the GFA is closely related to the transport properties of Fe-based BMGs. Among the alloy system studied, the alloy containing 7% Co (Co7) shows the lowest electrical conductivity over a wide temperature range and the lowest thermal conductivity at room temperature. The origin of the superhigh GFA for the Co7 alloy has been discussed in terms of the covalent-like metal-metalloid bond energy and the atomic vibration. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

After the fine horizontal alignment, using the output angle velocity of the gyros, we can calculate the azimuth misalignment angle in high speed. Theoretical analysis as well as the simulation result indicate: Compared with the method using Kalman filter in the whole process of the alignment, the piece-wise fast alignment method has the same steady-state accuracy, but in the process of the fine azimuth alignment, the mechanical arrangement of SINS is not needed and the computational complexity is reduced. The time of fine alignment can be shortened to 60 seconds or so. This method makes up the defect that the convergence of the azimuth misalignment angle is slow, accelerates the initial alignment process and has an important practical value.",

        "abstract": "The ultimate goal of systems biology research area is to accurately predict the behavior of biological systems through the construction of computational models, using the related molecular-level data as the input, especially when the structural information of such biological system is available. Combining the three-dimensional (3D) structural information of the cohort of macromolecules underpinning the biological system, the researchers are poised with an unprecedented opportunity to gain a full understanding on how the molecules interact with each other, particularly for an interaction network, e.g. protein-protein interaction networks. Specifically, there are currently a limited number of studies focused on the reconstruction and modelling of the structural interaction networks (SIN) between hosts-pathogens protein-protein interaction networks. In this paper, we will survey the SIN on protein-protein interactions network, in which we focus on the interactions between pathogen and host species (PHPPI). As one of the most important component of inter-species PPI study, in-depth study of PHPPI at atomic-resolution level would reveal novel insights into the underlying principles of the organization and complexity of host-pathogen PPI networks. Several related sub areas are discussed, and the related typical Big Data methods including machine learning methodologies and statistics models will also be discussed. This paper contributes to a new, yet challenging, research area in applying data analytic and machine learning technologies in bioinformatics.",

This study aimed to assess the effects of maternal excessive iodine intake from drinking water on thyroid functions of both mothers and their neonates.This observational study was performed in high iodine (HI) areas and adequate iodine (AI) intake areas, including 384 healthy pregnant women in late gestation (mean week 39·3 ± 1·6 weeks) and their newborns. Blood and urine samples were obtained from pregnant women, while cord blood samples were obtained from neonates. Urinary iodine concentration (UIC) and thyroid function were evaluated.The median maternal UIC was 1241 and 217 μg/l in HI and AI areas, respectively (P < 0·001). The concentrations of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4) in neonates in HI areas were 7·33 mIU/l (range 5·47, 11·06 mIU/l), 2·93 ± 0·59 and 15·03 ± 1·92 pmol/l, respectively, while that were 4·71 mIU/l (range 3·96, 6·04 mIU/l), 2·31 ± 0·28 and 16·50 ± 1·35 pmol/l in AI neonates (P < 0·05). Similar changes were also observed in neonates in HI areas when excluding the effect of maternal thyroid autoimmunity. Cord blood TSH concentration (r = 0·31, P = 0·001) and FT3 concentration (r = 0·43, P = 0·001) were positively correlated with maternal UIC. Cord blood FT4 concentration was negatively correlated with maternal UIC (r = -0·25, P = 0·001). Mothers living in HI areas (β = 0·296, 95% CI: 0·163, 0·255) and with subclinical hypothyroidism (β = 0·360, 95% CI: 0·034, 0·175) contributed to elevated cord blood TSH concentration in neonates, while male neonates were more likely to present with higher TSH concentration compared with female infants (β = -0·760, 95% CI: -0·119, -0·033).Excessive iodine intake during pregnancy was associated with an increased rate of hyperthyrotropinaemia in neonates and their mothers, especially in male neonates.",

Up till now, for the nation and international experts, radial sawn timber has not been studied on its role and its function in sound radiation. This paper deals with seven important Spruce species that grow up in Sichuan and Heilongjiang Province of China and a Picea sitchensis specimen from America.

The form of the equation was proposed based on the isochoric specific heat capacity calculation equation derived by the Peng-Robinson equation of state. The generalized coefficients were determined by 1734 liquid experimental  c   v   data from 17 refrigerants. With known critical point, acentric factor and idea gas isochoric specific heat capacity, the developed equation can represent the liquid  c   v   of 17 refrigerants well with the average absolute relative deviation of 1.55%. Large deviations are most likely to appear near the critical point. Comparisons were made to the calculation deviations from the Peng-Robinson equation of state and the multiproperty equations in REFPROP 9.1 software. It indicates that the developed equation provide a simple and reliable method for the calculation of the liquid  c   v  . Additionally, 9 mixture refrigerants were calculated by the proposed generalized equation with the average absolute relative deviation of 3.13%.",

        "abstract": "By adjusting the type of catalysts, the controlled growth of micropatterned WO2 and WO3 nanowire arrays has been first accomplished at low temperature (450-600 °C). The as-prepared WO2 and WO 3 nanowires are proven to be single crystalline structures with a single phase by Raman and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. Their formation mechanisms are attributed to the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism. It is found that both micropatterned WO2 and WO 3 nanowire arrays have very excellent field emission (FE) properties with quite low turn-on field (1.36 V/μm) and threshold field (2.38 V/μm), which is very similar to carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with best FE behaviors. In addition, the physical properties of an individual WO2 and individual WO3 nanowire are compared to probe the determinant factor for their different FE behaviors and understand their FE mechanism. Their very excellent FE performance suggests that this novel growth method is a useful technique for low-temperature preparation of micropatterned nanoemitter cathode arrays. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To improve recognition and imaging diagnosis of aneurysmal bone cyst secondary to a giant cell tumor. Methods: To collect the dates of 12 patients with aneurysmal bone cyst secondary to a giant cell tumor were proved by operation and pathology from January 2003 to October 2006. Analyzed and summarized their imaging manifestations and correlation with pathohistology. Results: Six lesions were located in epiphysis and metaphysic regions of long bone. Six lesions were located in pelvis. All cases showed a cystic lesion with expanded and osteolytic, eccentric 10 cases and centric 2 cases. Four cases display trabeculate, the margin is well define with a rim of bone sclerosis in 2 cases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were available in 10 patients. All case showed cystic, dilated lesions with solid areas. Eight cases manifested single or multitude solid nodules in big cystic wall. Two cases appeared solid masses with multitude cysts. The sign of multitude fluid-fluid level, best seen on T 2-weighted images, was present in all patients. Seven cases emerged soft-tissue masses. MR found indicative of large amounts of hemosiderin in one cases. Eight cases were examined by spiral CT with plain scanning and enhancement scanning. Reconstructed image were CTA and 3D-MPR (three dimensions multiplanar reconstruction) imaging. All cases showed cystic, dilated lesions with solid areas. The sign of multitude fluid-fluid level was present in 6 patients. The solid areas and cystic-wall of lesions showed contrast enhancement in 8 patients. 3D-MPR imaging showed supply blood vessel of tumors in 3 cases. Arteriovenous malformation did not found in all patients. The surgeons' operative findings and the gross specimens were studied in all patients. All lesions were composed of solid areas and cystic areas. The diagnosis of pathology were ABC with GCT(grade II) in 10 cases and ABC with GCT (grade III). Conclusion: Aneurysmal bone cyst secondary to a giant cell tumor is not rare. Adequately recognizing the pathologic basis of ABC, and selecting imaging techniques correctly (X-ray and MRI, or X-ray and CT) is especially important to diagnose a giant-cell tumor with secondary aneurysmal bone cyst. When an eccentric, expanded, lytic tumor with a cystic-solid lesion in epiphysis of long bone or pelvis shows multiple fluid levels, a giant-cell tumor with secondary aneurysmal bone cyst components should be sufficiently considered.",

        "abstract": "The magnetic properties and magnetocaloric effects in NaZn 13-type La1-xPrxFe10.7Co 0.8Si1.5 compounds have been investigated. Partially replacing La with Pr leads to a small reduction in the Curie temperature T C due to the lattice contraction, but the values of TC for La1-xPrxFe10.7Co0.8Si1.5 are close to room temperature. The maximum values of magnetic entropy change ΔSm in La1-xPrxFe10.7Co 0.8Si1.5 with x 0.5 are in the range 13.5-14.6 J kg -1 K-1 for a field change of 0-5 T, and correspondingly the values of the refrigerant capacity (RC) are 373-353 J kg-1. In particular, the values of ΔSm and RC for a low field change from 0 to 2 T are also obtained to be as high as 7.0-8.1 J kg-1 K-1 and 128-139 J kg-1, respectively. No magnetic hysteresis is observed in the magnetization as a function of both the temperature and the magnetic field in the La1-xPrxFe 10.7Co0.8Si1.5 compounds. The large reversible ΔSm and the high reversible RC for a low field change indicate that La1-xPrxFe10.7Co0.8Si 1.5 may be a promising candidate for magnetic refrigeration near room temperature. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Lithium triborate (LiB3O5, LBO) crystal is now one of the most useful nonlinear optical materials for frequency conversion of high power lasers. The use of the crystal, however, has been hampered by the unavailability of antireflective (AR) coatings with high laser damage resistance. In this work, a “point contact” dip-coating method is developed to prepare sol–gel SiO2 AR coatings on small-size LBO crystals. Using this approach, we obtain a homogenous coating surface on an 8 mm×8 mm×3 mm LBO crystal. The stress measurements show that the stresses in sol–gel SiO2 coatings vary with the time of natural drying, which is beyond our expectation. The anisotropic Young’s modulus of the LBO crystal and the different evolution tendency of the stress in the different SiO2 coating layers are found to be responsible for the crack of the double-layer AR coatings on anisotropic LBO crystal. Meanwhile, the resulting coatings on LBO crystal achieve a LIDT of over 15 J/cm2 (532 nm, 3ns) and the coated LBO is expected to ...",

        "title": "High temperature deformation behaviors of Ti40Zr25Ni3Cu12Be20 bulk metallic glass",
        "abstract": "Compressive deformation behaviors of a cast Ti 40 Zr 25 Ni 3 Cu 12 Be 20 bulk metallic glass in the test temperatures ranging from 428 to 658 K were examined in a broad range of strain rates from 1.3 × 10 −4 to 3 × 10 −2 s −1 . The alloy studied exhibits an extraordinary compressive superplastic formability within the supercooled liquid region, typically evidenced by a large compressive strain up to 0.83. The superplastic flow behaviors are strongly dependent on the test temperatures and applied strain rates. At low temperatures or high strain rates, the viscosity measured is found to dramatically decrease with increasing strain rate (i.e., non-Newtonian flow) and a stress overshoot is detected in the first steps of strain. At low strain rates or high test temperatures, the studied glass exhibits a Newtonian flow behavior. The value of activation volume increases with increasing test temperatures. Keywords Ti-based bulk metallic glass Superplastic deformation Supercooled liquid region Viscosity Activation volume 1 Introduction During the last decades, bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) have stimulated extensive enthusiasm for scientific research because of their superior properties associated with their unique atomic structure, including high yield strength, large elastic limit, and excellent wear resistance [1,2] . However, widespread structural and functional applications of these advanced materials are severely hindered by the lack of significant permanent deformation prior to failure [3,4] . For BMG alloys, plastic deformation is highly localized into very narrow shear bands, resulting in no or very little plastic strain (usually less than 2%) and catastrophic failure at room temperature [3,4] . It is well documented that heating BMGs to temperatures between the glass transition ( T g ) and crystallization ( T x ) temperature (i.e., the so-called supercooled liquid region, SLR, or Δ T ) caused them to soften drastically to a point at which they take on complex shapes unachievable with conventional metals [5–10] . Chiang et al. [8] found that Cu 60 Zr 20 Hf 10 Ti 10 glass exhibited a large compressive strain of 0.78 when deformed within SLR. Gun et al. [9] demonstrated that elongations of over 1000% were possible during high temperature deformation of Mg 65 Cu 25 Y 10 BMG. Wang et al. [7] examined the superplastic deformation behaviors of Vit1 bulk glassy alloy and found that its maximum elongation can reach as high as 1624% within SLR. The unique superplastic formability within SLR might be able to circumvent this lack of room temperature ductility and has been used for a wide range of processes, including nano-moulding [11] , net-shape fabrication [12,13] , extrusion [10,14] , surface embossing [15] and writing-erasing [16] . In the present study, the compressive deformation behaviors and formability of a Ti-based bulk metallic glass within SLR were examined. 2 Experimental details A typical BMG, Ti 40 Zr 25 Ni 3 Cu 12 Be 20 (at.%), was chosen for this study, due to its excellent glass-forming ability [17,18] . To achieve compositional homogeneity, the master alloys were remelted at least four times. Alloy ingots were prepared by arc melting pure metals of Ti, Zr, Ni, Cu, and Be together in a Ti-gettered argon atmosphere. Cylindrical samples of the studied alloy with 3 mm in diameter were obtained by melt casting into a Cu mould. The amorphous structure of the as-cast samples was verified by X-ray diffraction. Thermal response was examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at a heating rate of 20 K min −1 . The DSC study revealed that T g and T x are 603 and 654 K, respectively, giving rise to a supercooled liquid region of 51 K. For a series of compressive mechanical tests, the 3 mm diameter cylindrical samples were cut into 6 mm lengths from the as-cast rods and then carefully ground and polished to ensure that both the top and the bottom surfaces perpendicular to the loading axis are parallel prior to testing. BN powders were used as lubricant to minimize friction between test samples and the compression platform. High temperature deformation tests were conducted using an Instron 5500R type machine equipped with a high temperature furnace capable of maintaining a temperature fluctuation within ±1 K. In order to shorten the time for heating the sample, the compressive jig was preheated to the pre-determined test temperature. Once the target temperature was reached, a sample was then rapidly placed into the holder load train and held for about 500 s to stabilize its temperature before loading. 3 Results and discussion Strain rate often has a significant effect on the high temperature deformation response of amorphous metals [5] . Fig. 1 shows a representative series of true stress–true strain curves obtained from the deformation of the Ti-based BMG alloy at different test temperatures and a variety of applied strain rates. At 613 K, four typical strain rates of 1.3 × 10 −4 , 4.0 × 10 −4 , 1.0 × 10 −3 , and 3.0 × 10 −3 s −1 were selected and the corresponding true stress–true strain curves are shown in Fig. 1 a. For the case of ε ˙ = 3 × 10 − 3   s − 1 at 613 K, 1.0 × 10 −2 s −1 at 628 K, 3.0 × 10 −2 s −1 at 643 K, a brittle fracture at maximum strength without macroscopic plasticity, indicating inhomogeneous deformation, can be identified. For the smaller strain rates, the true stress–true strain curves are characterized by a stress overshoot in the initial stage of deformation followed by a steady-state flow with a stress plateau in the extended strain region. The peak of the stress overshoot decreased monotonically as the strain rate decreased. The stress overshoot as a transient phenomenon has been reported to occur in Zr-based [5,7] , and Mg-based [9] bulk metallic glasses and has been attributed to a change in atomic mobility because of a rapid change of free volume [6] . Interestingly, the curves at test temperatures of 628 and 643 K under the strain rate of 1.3 × 10 −4 s −1 (the lowest strain rate used in the present work), show evidence of strain-hardening during the later stage of the deformation. A similar phenomenon has also been reported previously in Zr-based [6] , Ca-based [19] , and Cu-based [20] BMGs. Lower strain rate usually means that compressive deformation takes a longer time and the effect of high-ambient temperature on the amorphous phase is more serious. Thus, the strain-hardening resulting from the structural change of the amorphous phase occurs in the extended process of deformation [7] . At a test temperature of 658 K, within the strain rate range studied, no brittle fracture feature can be identified from the true stress–true strain curves. For strain rates of 1.0 × 10 −2 and 3.0 × 10 −2 s −1 , a characteristic stress overshoot evolves before the system reaches a steady-state. Meanwhile, lower strain rates, i.e., 3.0 × 10 −3 , 1.0 × 10 −3 , and 4.0 × 10 −4 s −1 , promote homogeneous flow with a pronounced steady-state regime at a constant true stress. It should be noted that a significant compressive strain of 0.83 (not shown here) can be achieved after compressive deformation at 658 K with an applied strain rate of 3.0 × 10 −3 s −1 . Such unique flowability for the alloy studied will enable precise shaping of complex parts, widening the range of its applications towards elevated temperature within SLR. In addition to the strong strain rate dependence of the deformation of Ti-based glassy alloy studied, the test temperature dependence of the true stress–true strain curves has been also investigated. A typical example of the true stress–true strain curves is shown in Fig. 2 a for a strain rate of 4.0 × 10 −4 s −1 and different test temperatures. The true stress–true strain curves for the test temperatures lower than 613 K exhibit a linear relationship before failure, typical of brittle deformation behavior. As the test temperature increases, the maximum stress gradually decreases. When the test temperature is between 613 and 643 K, the deformation mode switched from being inhomogeneous (shear failure) to homogeneous. A characteristic stress overshoot can be identified before the system reaches a steady-state from the true stress–true curves. At 658 K, the stress increased monotonically as the strain increased until it reached a steady-state value and subsequently leveled off as the strain increased further. Three different types of deformation modes can be identified from the above observations. The first mode is characterized by brittle fracture without appreciable plastic flow caused by shear localization at lower temperatures and higher strain rates. The second mode, i.e., steady-state flow after a stress overshoot, occurs at an intermediate temperature and strain rate region, while the third mode, i.e., large viscous flow without stress overshoot implying Newtonian viscous flow, is observed under the test conditions of lower strain rates and higher temperatures. XRD patterns for the Ti-based BMG sample tested from 613 to 658 K with an applied strain rate of 4.0 × 10 −4 s −1 , along with that from the as-cast sample are shown in Fig. 2 b. Broad Bragg peaks with no detectable crystalline phases are observed, suggesting that the amorphous structure is the major phase in the tested alloy. Thus, the samples are essentially amorphous after testing within the supercooled liquid region at a strain rate of 4.0 × 10 −4 s −1 . To further discuss the flow behaviors of the BMG, the flow stress, which is defined as the peak-yield stress, as a function of the applied strain rate at various test temperatures is plotted in Fig. 3 . The curves shift towards higher flow stress with decreasing test temperature. Fig. 4 shows plots of strain rate dependence of viscosity for the bulk Ti-based metallic glass studied. The viscosity, η , is calculated based on the following equation η = σ / 3 ε ˙ [5] . For the case of 658 K, at lower strain rate, such as 4.0 × 10 −4 and 1.0 × 10 −3 s −1 , the viscosity was essentially independent of the strain rate, indicating a linear relationship between flow stress and strain rate (i.e., Newtonian flow). At higher strain rate, however, there is a rapid decrease in the viscosity, and the viscosity is no longer a constant, demonstrating a transition from Newtonian flow to non-Newtonian flow. This tendency shifted towards higher strain rate and lower viscosity with increasing test temperature. At a low temperature of 613 K, the negative strain rate dependence of viscosity is strong within the applied strain rates, showing a non-Newtonian flow. For a direct comparison, results from Pd 40 Ni 40 P 20 [21] , Cu 60 Zr 20 Hf 10 Ti 10 [8] , and Mg 65 Cu 25 Gd 10 [22] glasses are also included in Figs. 3 and 4 . It is noted that flow stress of the Ti-based glass studied is larger than those of the Pd-based, Cu-based, and Mg-based glasses. On the other hand, under the proper testing conditions, the Pd-based, Cu-based, and Mg-based glasses exhibit a distinct transition from Newtonian to non-Newtonian flow, as indicated in Fig. 4 . This is consistent with the observation of the Ti-based glass studied. For the purpose of explaining the deformation trends of the metallic glass used in the study, a useful physical-based model, i.e., free volume model, was employed in the present work. The concept of free volume has been proposed initially for liquid structures by Cohen and Turnbull [23] and has been extended by Spaepen [24] for plastic flow of amorphous metal materials. Free volume in amorphous structure is defined as excess volume compared to an ideal disordered atomic configuration of maximum density. For the case of high temperature deformation of metallic glasses, the free volume model provides a constitutive flow law written in terms of uniaxial stress σ and strain rate ε ˙ as ε ˙ = ε ˙ 0   sinh ( σ V act / 2 3 k T ) [24] , where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature, at which the deformation is carried out, the activation volume V act , as well as the reference strain rate ε ˙ 0 is used as fitting parameters for adapting the model curves to the experiment data. Both V act and ε ˙ 0 for a given test temperature can be obtained by fitting the experiment values of stresses and strain rates using the above equation, and the corresponding results are listed in Table 1 . As can be seen, at 658 K, the value of the activation volume V act is about 0.4127 nm 3 and this is reduced to 0.1502 nm 3 at 613 K, with values of ε ˙ 0 ranging from 1.5 × 10 −4 to 8.0 × 10 −4 s −1 . Such volumes is of about the same order of magnitude as that suggested by Argon for binary Pd–Si glass [25] and also comparable to more recent estimates for Zr-based [26] , Pd-based [27] , La-based [28] , Mg-based [9] metallic glasses and Zr-based metallic glass matrix composites [29,30] . It can also be clearly seen from Table 1 that V act decreases with decreasing test temperatures. During the high temperature deformation of metallic glass, with an increase in the test temperature, the viscosity of the BMG drops and consequently the fluidity increases, leading to higher value for activation volume for higher test temperatures. 4 Conclusions The excellent plastic deformation behavior of a TiZrNiCuBe glassy alloy in the supercooled liquid region has been demonstrated. A large compressive strain of 0.83 can be achieved at 658 K and a strain rate of 3.0 × 10 −3 s −1 . Plastic flow of supercooled liquid depends strongly on both applied strain rate and test temperature. The supercooled liquid behaves like a Newtonian fluid at high temperatures and low strain rates. However, non-Newtonian flow dominates during deformation at low temperatures and high strain rates.

        "abstract": "The integration of Web services is a recent outgrowth of the Business Process integration field that will require powerful meta-schema matching mechanisms supported by higher level abstractions, such as UML meta-models. Currently, there are many XML-based workflow process specification languages (e.g. XPDL, BPEL) which can be used to define business processes in the Web services and Grid Computing world. However, with limited capability to describe the relationships (schemas or ontologies) between process objects, the dominant use of XML as a meta-data markup language makes the semantics of the processes ambiguous. OWL-S (Ontology Web Language for Services) exploits the semantic description power of OWL to build an ontology language for services. It therefore becomes a candidate for an inter lingua. In this paper, we propose an integration framework for business processes, which is applied to Web services defined in OWL-S.",

However, the complexity and potential toxicity of the present common synthesis methods limit their clinical application. Herein, multifunctional hyaluronic acid-MnO nanoparticles (HA-MnO NPs) are synthesized in a simple way by directly mixing sodium permanganate with HA aqueous solutions, which serve as both a reducing agent and a surface-coating material. The obtained HA-MnO NPs show an improved water-dispersibility, fine colloidal stability, low toxicity, and responsiveness to the tumor microenvironment (high H O and high glutathione, low pH). After intravenous injection, HA-MnO NPs exhibit a high imaging sensitivity for detecting rat intracranial glioma with MRI for a prolonged period of up to 3 d. These nanoparticles also effectively alleviate the tumor hypoxia in a rat model of intracranial glioma. The downregulation of VEGF and HIF-1α expression in intracranial glioma validates the sustained attenuation effect of HA-MnO NPs on tumor hypoxia. These results show that HA-MnO NPs can be used for sensitive, targeted MRI detection of gliomas and simultaneous attenuation of tumor hypoxia.",

        "abstract": "Transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) is a promising treatment strategy for acute ischemic stroke. In vivo tracking of the therapeutic stem cells in the host brain after transplantation is essential not only to ensure the safety and efficacy of the treatment, but also to better understand their migrational dynamics and regeneration potential. Many polymeric nanoparticles have been developed to label stem cells for in vivo tracking by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), optical imaging (OI) or other imaging modalities. However, the non-degradability and presence of cellular toxicity of the nanoparticles restrict their clinical applications. In this study, we developed a novel cationic polymeric micelles based on amphipathic polymer of biodegradable hydrophilic poly(aspartic acid-dimethylethanediamine) (PAsp(DMA)) that were conjugated with two molecules of hydrophobic cholic acid (CA) by lysine. Image labels, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) and fluorescent nile red were simultaneously loaded into the micelles to label NSCs. The labeling capacity, efficiency and cytotoxicity of the cationic micelles were determined. The in vivo MRI tracking of the therapeutic NSCs in acute ischemic stroke was also explored. Our results showed that this type of cationic polymeric micelles achieved a high efficient and safe labeling of NSCs and resulted in reliable in vivo MRI tracking of therapeutic stem cells in acute ischemic stroke, but without detrimental effect. The cationic, biodegradable polymeric micelles are highly translatable for clinical application and can be used as a versatile nanoplatform for stem cell labeling and subsequently in vivo tracking in regenerative medicine.",

We report the fabrication of novel g-C 3 N 4 /Ag 3 PO 4 /Ag 2 MoO 4  ternary composite materials and the exploration of heterostructure materials for water oxidation under LED illumination. The hybridization of three semiconductors has been confirmed by microscopic study, chemical and structural analyses. Enhanced oxygen-producing activity over the obtained ternary composite photocatalysts was observed. The reasons responsible for the enhanced oxygen-evolving performance can be ascribed to the improved light absorption toward visible light, faster charge separation and charge transportation, as well as more powerful water oxidation capability originating from the in-situ construction of dual Z-scheme-type channels under visible light irradiation. The key role of in-situ formed metallic Ag as the electron mediator is suggested based on the theoretical and experimental results. The successful synthesis of fascinating ternary water oxidation photocatalysts provides new insights into the development of novel all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalytic systems for energy and environmental applications.",

        "abstract": "It is found that learners prefer to use micro learning mode to conduct learning activities through open educational resources (OERs). However, adaptive micro learning is scarcely supported by current OER platforms. In this paper we focus on profiling an effective micro learning process which is central to establish the raw materials and set up rules for the final adaptive process. This work consists of two parts. First, we conducted an educational data mining and learning analysis study to discover the patterns and rules in micro learning through OER. Then based on its findings, we profiled features of both learners and OERs to reveal the full learning story in order to support the decision making process. Incorporating educational data mining and learning analysis, an cloud-based architecture for Micro Learning as a Service (MLaaS) was designed to integrate all necessary procedures together as a complete service for delivering micro OERs. The MLaaS also provides a platform for resource sharing and exchanging in peer-to-peer learning environment. Working principle of a key step, namely the computational decision-making of micro OER adaptation, was also introduced.",

        "abstract": "Objective To condcut preliminary study of the value of DTI(diffusion tensor imaging) in human cervical spinal cord.Methods Twenty-one patients suffering from cervical spondylotic myelopathy and twenty volunteers without any clinical symptoms underwent routine MRI and DTI examination.DTI was performed in six non-collinear directions with single-shot fast spin echo echo-planar imaging sequence(b value= 400 s·mm-2).ADC(apparent diffusion coefficient)and FA(fractional anisotropy)values were measured by ROIs(regions of interest) in 4 different level segment spinal cord(C2/3,C3/4,C4/5,C5/6) in normal volunteers,in lesions and normal segmental spinal cord in clinical cases respectively.DTI original images were automatically processed by using IDL(Version 5.6) software to produce color tensor images.SPSS11.0 software for windows was used for t-test and one-way ANOVA analysis.The difference was considered statistically significant if P<0.05.Results(1) For volunteers,cervical spinal cord exhibited intermediated signal intensity on ADC map,high signal intensity on FA map,and blue color on the colorized FA map.Four different level segment spinal cord,C2/3,C3/4,C4/5,C5/6,were analyzed and it was found that FA value between them had a significant difference by ANOVA,F=159.24,P<0.001,with the highest FA value(0.85±0.03) ofspinal cord segment of C2/3 level.However,ADC value between 4 segments had no significant difference(F=2.191,P>0.05).(2)In patients of cervical spondylotic myelopathy,routine MRI T2WI showed abnormal signal in 9 cases,and showed no abnormal signal in 12 cases.In sixteen cases it was found that abnormal patchy green signal on colorized tensor maps appeared on the normal blue spinal cord.Also,in patients of cervical spondylotic myelopathy,there was significant difference in ADC and FA value between lesions and normal spinal cord(paired t test,for ADC,t=2.88,P<0.05,for FA,t=2.62,P<0.05).Conclusion FA value of C2/3 level segment spinal cord in normal volunteers(0.85±0.03) is the highest among other segments.FA value decreases gradually along cervical spinal cord towards the caudal direction.However,the difference of ADC values amongst 4 segments is not significant.DTI colorized tensor maps can show more lesions than routine MRI.With the technique of single-shot fast spin echo echo-planar imaging sequence and diffusion in six non-collinear directions and a b value of 400 s·mm-2,DTI can clearly display the anatomic structure and lesions in the cervical spinal cord.",

A magnetic interaction comparable to that between Fe atoms is found between the R and Fe atoms, which causes an enhancement of the Curie temperature up to ∼11% when ∼30% of the La atoms are replaced by R. The R-Fe coupling is further found to be strongly dependent of the species of the rare earths. It monotonically grows as R sweeps from Ce to Nd. This could be a consequence of the lanthanide contraction, which causes an enhancement of the intra-atomic magnetic coupling. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.",

However, their clinical translation has not been fully realized due, in part, to insufficient ability to track stem cell migration and survival longitudinally over long periods of time in vivo. In this work, we synthesized a new class of manometer-sized cationic polymersomes loaded with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and quantum dots for in vivo dual-modal imaging of stem cells. The results demonstrated that the synthesized cationic polymersomes can act as an effective and safety carrier to transfer image labels into neural stem cells, upon which the distribution and migration of grafted stem cells could be monitored by MR imaging up to 6 weeks and by fluorescence imaging within 4 weeks in the context of ischaemic brain injury. Cationic polymersomes hold great promise in the longitudinal monitoring of transplanted stem cells by using dual-modal MRI and optical imaging.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To observe the impact of various suture insertion depths on the survival rate and brain changes of intraluminal suture middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) models using MRI. Methods: Forty adult SD rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (each n=10), and intraluminal MCAO modeling was performed respectively with the suture insertion depth of 1.8 cm, 2.0 cm, 2.2 cm and maximum (until no longer advanceable, about 2.4-2.5 cm). Brain MR imaging and TTC staining were performed, and the infarct volume and lesion distribution on MRI were assessed 48 h later, and the survival rate was recorded after 24 h and 48 h. Results: When the suture insertion depth was 1.8 cm, 2.0 cm, 2.2 cm and maximum, the infarct volume measured on MRI 48 h later was (8.25±3.24)%, (16.18±3.41)%, (21.18±3.61)% and (33.87±3.45)%, and the variation coefficient was 0.39, 0.21, 0.17 and 0.10, and the survival rate was 100% (10/10), 80.00% (8/10), 50.00% (5/10) and 30.00% (3/10), respectively. In intramural model with the suture insertion depth 1.8 cm, the modeling success rate was low, and the infarct volume was small 48 h later. In intramural model with the suture insertion depth 2.0 and 2.2 cm, the resulted infarct volume was larger, but the survival rate decreased with insertion depth 2.2 cm (P<0.05). In intramural model with maximum suture insertion depth, the resulted infarct volume was the largest and the survival rate was the lowest. The infarct location was not significantly different among different suture insertion depths (P>0.05). Conclusion: With the increase of suture insertion depth in MCAO mo-del, the resulted infarct volume will increase and animal survival rate will decrease. The infarction has a tendency of cortical involvement. The suture insertion depth of 2.0 cm is suitable for establishing stable MCAO experimental models with high survival rate in adult rats.

The QoS-aware Peer selection is one of the major challenges faced in order to guarantee the success and enhance performance of distributed computing. Since many Peer candidates provide overlapping or identical functionalities, though with different QoS evaluations, selections need to be rapidly conducted to determine which Peers are suitable to join in the requested composite service. The main contribution of this paper is proposing a P2P-based service selection model, in which Peer’s non-functional properties are modeled with Web Service Modelling Ontology (WSMO), and where Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) technique is adopted to facilitate and enhance the QoS-aware Peers’ composition. We present experimental results to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.",

The results of experimental observation and theoretical inference can be summarized as follows. As the melt thickness a is large enough, causing the ratio of plate thickness to current theoretic skin depth a/δ larger than 2.2, the electromagnetic pressure acting on melt can be simply expressed as P m = B 2/2μ, and the melt shape would be known only by measuring the distribution of magnetic flux density. As a is small and makes the ratio a/δ less than 2.2, the melt shape and electromagnetic pressure for confining and shaping are determined not only by magnetic flux density B but also by melt thickness a, electromagnetic parameter μγ and current frequency f. In this paper, an equation used to calculate electromagnetic pressure acting on \"thin plate-form melt\" is brought forward. The equation gives a precise relationship between electromagnetic pressure factor p and melt thickness a, electromagnetic parameter μγ and current frequency f.",

In this paper, a TiO2 nanoporous coating was prepared successfully on the GaAs substrate by sol-gel method. The optical parameters of the coating were also controlled successfully. It was proved that the coating could greatly improve the transmittance of the incident light, which agrees with the theoretical results quite well. In the 2.5-6.0 μm waveband, the maximum transmittance of GaAs substrate is 56%, while the transmittance of the GaAs substrate coated with a nanostructured TiO2 coating is about 94%.",

The results show that these phases are very different in both the morphology and sizes, and they are dependent on the thickness of wedge ingot, i.e., the cooling rates. It is therefore concluded that the Zr 2 Ni phase is the strongest competing rival to the amorphous matrix in this alloy. These findings support that compared to Zr–Ni pair, Zr–Cu pair has a larger glass forming tendency. The glass forming ability can be improved by inhibiting the precipitation of Zr 2 Ni phase by, for example, decreasing the Ni content in this alloy.",

The true stress-strain curve exhibited an initial hardening transient, a peak flow stress, and then a flow softening. The alloy exhibited a microstructural instability during the tensile deformation, characterized by coarsening, fragmentation, and spheroidization of the O-phase. This microstructural instability was enhanced by the imposed strain rather than the applied stress. After a strain of ε = 0.56, a refined microstructure with equiaxed or near-equiaxed O-phase grains formed. Based on the results of the microstructural evolution, the origin of the flow softening behavior was suggested. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "To control the grain growth of nanocrystalline WC–Co cemented carbides by phosphorus (P) doping was studied in spark plasma sintering (SPS). Experimental results show that the use of small amount of phosphorus dopant to chemically-activated sintering of the nanocrystalline WC–Co composites could enhance the sinterability, promote the low temperature densification, and decrease the sintering temperature of the WC–Co nanocomposites. With only 0.3 wt.% P additions, full density WC–7Co cermets were obtained at temperature as low as 1000 °C, which is 100 °C lower than that of the undoped counterparts in spark plasma sintering of the nanocomposites. By phosphorus doping in WC–Co nanocomposites, the grain growth of WC–Co cemented carbides could be inhibited to some extent, as a result WC–7 wt.% Co–0.3 wt.% P cemented carbides with average WC grain size of 200 nm were achieved, which can be attributed to the lower sintering temperature resulting in a decrease of grain boundary mobility. Mechanical properties measurements show that P doping could lead to a great increment of hardness, but at the same time a little sacrifice of fracture toughness of the nano-WC–Co cemented carbides. Keywords WC–Co cemented carbides Spark plasma sintering Phosphorus Grain growth Mechanical properties 1 Introduction Tungsten carbide/cobalt (WC–Co) cemented carbides or cermets, characterized by their high hardness and strength, are used in applications where materials with high wear resistance and toughness are required [1] . In hardmetals industry, it is considered that nanostructured cemented carbides as an important branch of nanocrystalline materials could offer new opportunities for achieving superior hardness and toughness combinations [2,3] . However, attempts to fabricate nanocrystalline WC–Co hardmetals by conventional methods have been frustrated by the inability to retain a nanoscale grain size in the fully sintered bulk alloys, since the presence of an unusually high surface and interface area provides a strong driving force for grain growth [4] . Now, it is generally recognized that the promise of nanostructured WC–Co cemented carbides will not be realized, unless the grain growth problem can be overcome. To control the grain growth in nanostructured WC–Co composites, one of the keys is the proper selection of the second-phase additives as grain growth inhibitors. Vanadium carbide (VC) and chromium carbide (Cr 3 C 2 ) are by far the most effective grain growth inhibitors due to their high solubility and mobility in cobalt phase at lower temperatures [5] . Additionally, the combinations of VC and Cr 3 C 2 have better inhibition effects than that doped alone [6] . Alternatively, the grain growth can be inhibited to a certain extent by using special sintering techniques to accelerate the heating rate, increase the densification rate, decrease the sintering temperature and shorten the holding time, such as microwave sintering [7] , rapid hot pressing sintering [3] , spark plasma sintering (SPS) [8,9] , and so on. Especially, the spark plasma sintering is a newly developed sintering method, considered as a novel sintering technique for preparation of nanocrystalline materials, and mainly characterized by spark plasma created by on–off pulse direct current during heat treatment of powders in a graphite die [10] . Whereas, by the above two means, the average WC grain size of the sintered nanocrystalline WC–Co composites could not be controlled to a satisfactory scale. The phosphorus (P) has already been used in the nanostructured WC–Ni–P or WC–Co–Ni–P coating [11] with improved corrosion and wear resisting properties, in the diamond–tungsten carbide composites with reduced heat damage of diamond [12] , and in the micro-grain sized WC–Co cemented carbides with decreased sintering temperature [13] . Nevertheless, to our knowledge its application in the bulk nanocrystalline WC–Co cemented carbides is scarcely reported in the open literature. In the present paper, we try to control the grain growth of nanostructured WC–Co composites by phosphorus doping in the matrix to chemically-activated sintering of the WC–Co nanocomposites, and at the mean time combined with the presence of inhibitors of VC and Cr 3 C 2 and spark plasma sintering. The effect of phosphorus additions on densification, grain growth behavior and mechanical properties of the nanocrystalline WC–Co cemented carbides will be examined and discussed. 2 Theory and experimental 2.1 Theory of chemical activated sintering The sintering of WC–Co cemented carbides belongs to the representative liquid phase sintering, and the good mechanical properties of WC–Co could be achieved only if the two conditions must be provided in sintering process. Firstly, the sintering temperature should be high enough to form the eutectic liquid binder phase. Secondly, the liquid binder phase should have better flowability to infiltrate the WC framework. The sintering temperature would be 20–120 °C higher with different content of binder phase than the eutectic point of WC–Co alloy which is 1320 °C in the regular liquid phase sintering. The principle of chemically-activated sintering [14] is doping of small quantity of chemical element in the matrix powders to form lower eutectic point alloys with the binder phase in the sintering process, by which high density composites could be obtained at lower sintering temperature due to the fact that the eutectic liquid phase formed at lower temperature enhance the densification process of the alloy. As to the WC–Co cemented carbides, incorporating of small quantity of phosphorus (P) additives will form eutectic liquid phase at temperature of 1023 °C with cobalt (Co) binder phase. The binary phase diagram of Co–P alloy is shown in Fig. 1 . The transition equation could be formulated as: (1) Co + P ⇄ 1023 ° C L 2.2 Materials The nanocrystalline WC–7 wt.% Co powders with particle size of 1 μm and grain size of 40 nm, respectively, was prepared by thermochemical methods, 0.6 wt.% VC and 0.4 wt.% Cr 3 C 2 were added as grain growth inhibitors into the composite powders in the carbonization process. The red phosphorus with purity of 99.0% was used as the doping component. 2.3 Preparation procedure The phosphorus powders were dispersed in ethanol for 15 min using an ultrasonic shaker. Then, WC–7Co nanocrystalline powders, in which VC and Cr 3 C 2 inhibitors have been doped, were mixed with phosphorus powders and the mixtures were dispersed ultrasonically for 30 min. Finally, the mixed powders were ball milled for 120 min in ethanol media. The nominal composition of the phosphorus-doped composites is designed in this study to be WC–7Co–0.3P, for the reason that aliquation phenomenon will occur in the microstructures of WC–Co alloy if too much phosphorus were doped and the properties of the alloy will be deteriorated. The spark plasma sintering was carried out under vacuum in a Dr. Sinter ® Model SPS-1050 T spark plasma sintering system (Sumitomo Coal Mining Company, Japan). The schematic diagram of the apparatus for spark plasma sintering is illustrated in Fig. 2 . The sintering temperatures ranged from 900 to 1150 °C for up to 10 min and with axial pressure of 80 MPa. The applied electronic current of SPS was around 1000 A and the heating rate was maintained as 100 K/min. The SPS specimen size is a 20 mm diameter with a thickness of 7 mm. Nanocrystalline WC–7Co without phosphorus additions were also spark plasma sintered under the same condition for a comparison. 2.4 Properties and microstructural characterization The densities of the sintered compacts were determined using the Archimedes method in water immersion. The linear shrinkage of the compacts was monitored indirectly from the displacement of the graphite die of the SPS apparatus. The hardness was measured using Rockwell hardness tester with load of 60 kg. The fracture toughness ( K IC ) of the sintered WC-based cermets was determined by measuring the crack length from the tip of the indentation made by Vicker’s indentation load of 30 kg, which belongs to Palmqvist indentation toughness, could be calculated by the following equation [15] : (2) K IC =0.15 HV 30 ∑ i=1 4 l i where l i is the length of the crack tip from the hardness indent in mm. For accuracy, the specimen were polished to near-mirror finish and checked for face parallelism before testing [15] . The morphology of nanocrystalline WC–Co powders were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Model JSM-6301, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Model JEM-1200EX, Japan). The etched microstructures and fractured surface of the sintered composites were also observed using SEM. The average grain size of WC in the sintered composites was measured from the SEM image using the mean linear intercept method. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 The morphologies of the powders The morphologies of nanocrystalline WC–7Co composite powders are given in Fig. 3 . The powders are in sphere shape and there are some agglomerates in the powders. As shown in Fig. 3b , the particle size is about 40 nm in diameter, the grain size measured by X-ray diffraction and calculated by Scherer equation is consistent with TEM observations, which indicate that they are single particles in TEM. 3.2 Densification behavior Fig. 4 shows the variations of relative density of the composites with sintering temperature. As can be seen, the density of the composites with and without phosphorus additions increases with the sintering temperature, and high density composites (relative density above 99%) can be attained at lower temperature in spark plasma sintering (SPS) of the nano-WC–Co composites compared to those sintered by the conventional sintering techniques, such as vacuum sintering [16] , hot isostatic pressing (HIP) [17] , hot-pressing [3] , and so forth. That can be due to the special sintering mechanisms of the spark plasma sintering, for the on–off direct current of SPS could generate several effects: spark plasma, spark impact pressure, Joule heating, an electrical field diffusion effect [10,18] , as well as subsidiary axial stress of 80 MPa applied. It is evident that with 0.3 wt.% addition of phosphorus, almost full density composite (relative density 99.9%) could be obtained at a sintering temperature of as low as 1000 °C. For the pure nano-WC–7Co composite, in contrast, its full density could be realized at a sintering temperature of 1100 °C, which is 100 °C higher than that of the phosphorus doped one. The etched microstructures of nano-WC–7Co–0.3P cermets spark plasma sintered at temperature of 1000 °C and nano-WC–7Co spark plasma sintered at 1100 °C are indicated in Fig. 5a and b , respectively. As shown, the microstructures of sintered compacts are both homogeneous, and there exist few nano-pores on the grain boundaries. Owing to the chemically-activated sintering effect by doping of small amount of phosphorus in the nano-WC–Co composites, the Co–P liquid phase has formed at lower temperature and accelerated the densification process of the WC-based cermets. Fig. 6 shows the variation of linear shrinkage and shrinkage rate of the nanocomposites with sintering temperatures in SPS. It can be clearly seen that, the maximum shrinkage rate temperature of nano-WC–7Co–0.3P composites is about 950 °C, whereas it is about 1060 °C in the case of the pure nano-WC–7Co cermets. This implies that large quantity of Co–P liquid phase formed at temperature of about 950 °C in spark plasma sintering the nano-WC–7Co–0.3P composites, but the Co liquid phase formed at 1060 °C in nano-WC–7Co cermets. The WC–Co cermets have been chemically-activated sintered by phosphorus doping as a result of large quantity of Co–P liquid phase formed at lower temperatures. In virtue of the SPS technique used, large quantity of Co–P liquid phase has formed at temperature of as low as 950 °C, although the eutectic point of Co–P alloy is 1023 °C. In the pure nano-WC–7Co composites, most densification has been finished before the liquid phase formation by SPS as present in Fig. 6b . However, most densification could be finished after the Co–P liquid phase formed (950 °C) in nano-WC–7Co–0.3P composites see Fig. 6a in respect that too lower sintering temperature would result in few Co–P liquid phase formed which is insufficient for high densification. Accordingly, it can be concluded that full density nano-WC–Co hardmetals can be obtained at low temperatures with the phosphorus additions, due to its chemically-activated sintering effect. 3.3 Grain growth behavior Fig. 7 shows the variation of grain size of the composites with temperatures in spark plasma sintering. The average WC grain sizes of the composites with and without P additions increase with the sintering temperatures. From Figs. 4 and 7 , it can be seen that the grain sizes of nano-WC–7Co–0.3P composites are finer than those of the pure nano-WC–7Co cermets at the same densities. The average WC grain size of the composites with P additions spark plasma sintered at temperature of 1000 °C is about 200 nm, as shown in the etched microstructure of Fig. 5a and fracture surface of Fig. 8a . Whereas, the grain sizes of nano-WC–7Co composites spark plasma sintered at 1100 °C is around 250 nm shown in Figs. 5b and 8b . It is believed that the grain size of the WC–Co cermets is mainly influenced by the sintering temperature, originating from the temperature-dependent grain boundary migration. The grain boundary mobility can be formulated mathematically to equation [19] : (3) B= D b RT (4) D b =D 0 e −Q b RT where B is the mobility of grain boundary, D b the grain boundary diffusion, D 0 the diffusion constant, Q b the activation energy of grain boundary diffusion, R the gas constant, and T the sintering temperature. From Eqs. (3) and (4) , it can be noted that the mobility of grain boundary B will increase with the enhancing of the temperature T . In other words, deceasing the sintering temperature T can reduce the mobility of grain boundary B , thus grain growth can be inhibited to some extent. The addition of phosphorus allows chemically-activated sintering of nano-WC–Co cermets at lower sintering temperature. Therefore, the nano-WC–7Co–0.3P composites exhibit much finer microstructures. The variation of grain size with relative density in spark plasma sintered composites is presented in Fig. 9 . As indicated, the grain growth mostly occurred when the relative densities of the composites increase up to 90%. For the reason that large amount of liquid phase would form when the relative density above 90% in nanocrystalline WC–Co cermets. The presence of liquid phase would accelerate the solution-reprecipitation process and promote the continuous grain growth of the WC–Co cermets. Too high sintering temperatures have no benefits to the increment of the relative densities, but induce greatly grain growth of the WC–Co cermets in spark plasma sintering, as shown in Figs. 4 and 9 . Without P dopant, the grain size of the pure nano-WC–7Co cermets is larger than that of the P-doped one at the closely relative densities. The high density achieved at lower temperatures attributed to the addition of phosphorus can reduce the grain growth of WC grains in nanocrystalline WC–Co composites. As mentioned above, the sintering mechanism of SPS are different form the conventional sintering methods, e.g. vacuum sintering, HIP, and hot pressing. The SPS is a very rapid process and has its own sintering concept. Cha et al. [8] consolidated WC–10Co cemented carbides at 1050 °C with a 300 nm WC grain size by SPS from starting none inhibitors doped nanopowders. However, by the conventional vacuum sintering, the WC grain size will increase to 2 μm in 1 min if no grain growth inhibitors such as VC, Cr 3 C 2 etc. doped in the nanopowders [20] . It is recognized that conventional sintering methods hardly could be used to produce nanograined or quasi-nanograined WC cemented carbides. And the grain growth inhibition role of the inhibitors in the sintering of nanocrystalline powders become smaller than the micro-grain sized counterparts. In this study, with the help of SPS and VC, Cr 3 C 2 inhibitors, about 250 nm grain sized WC–7Co cemented carbides were obtained at 1100 °C. To control the grain growth of nanocystalline WC–Co composites by decreasing the sintering temperatures through P additions incorporating is a new way of grain growth inhibition in WC–Co system. In this study, combination of phosphorus and VC, Cr 3 C 2 inhibitors additions, as well as SPS, large amount of Co–P liquid phase was formed at 950 °C, as a result full density WC–7Co cermets with grain size of about 200 nm were fabricated at 1000 °C. Dotsenko et al. [13] have tested P doping in micrometer sized WC–Co composites in hot-pressing process, it is shown that the hot-pressing temperature has reduced from 150 to 200 °C resulting in a refined WC grain size in the sintered compacts. It is believed that temperature-reducing effect will be more obvious in consolidating of the phosphorous doped WC–Co nanocomposites by conventional sintering methods than by SPS, but the spark plasma sintered nano-cermets will exhibit finer WC grain size than that of the conventional sintering techniques. 3.4 Mechanical properties The variation of hardness and fracture toughness of the composites with the spark plasma sintering temperature is illustrated in Fig. 10 . As can be seen that, in the range of sintering temperatures used in the present study, the hardness of the composites with and without P additions increase with sintering temperature increasing until a maximum value appears. It can be ascribed that the densities of the nanocomposites increase with the increasing temperature, but at the final densification stage, large grain growth has occurred. However, the fracture toughness of the cermets with and without P doping is both increases monotonously with the sintering temperature. This can be due to the fact that the grains will grow with the increasing temperature; the larger grain size of WC, the greater effect of crack deflection in WC-based cermets. It can also be clearly seen in Table 1 that at sintering temperature of 1000 °C the WC–7Co–0.3P cermets with near full density (99.9% TD) and grain size of 200 nm has a combination of hardness 94.7 HRA and fracture toughness K IC 10.2 MPam 1/2 . The same relative density WC–7Co bulk cermets sintered at temperature of 1100 °C show hardness of 94.1 HRA and fracture toughness K IC 10.4 MPam 1/2 . At temperature of 1050 °C, the P-doped cermets show hardness of 94.2 HRA and fracture toughness K IC of 11.2 MPam 1/2 , as well as the undoped cermets exhibit hardness 93.9 HRA and fracture toughness K IC 12.7 MPam 1/2 , which sintered at temperature of 1150 °C also fully densified. It can be generally summarized from Fig. 10 and Table 1 that considering the dispersion of the mechanical properties, the full density nano-WC–7Co–0.3P composites exhibit much higher hardness and little lower fracture toughness when compared with the fully densified pure nano-WC–7Co cermets. The hardness of alloys and compounds is determined by the grain size deduced from the Hall–Petch relationship. The nano-WC–7Co–0.3P composites possess finer WC grains than nano-WC–7Co cermets; therefore, the hardness of the P-doped cermets is higher than that of the undoped counterpart. Higher hardness is a great advantage for WC–Co cemented carbides usually used as cutting, mining, chipless forming tools and wear parts. A higher hardness usually results in a greater wear resistance and a increasing of tool life. As to the fracture toughness, the strength of the Co–P phase is lower than the metal of Co; hence, the nano-WC–7Co–0.3P composites exhibit lower fracture toughness than that of the nano-WC–7Co cermets. Accordingly, doping with small amount of phosphorus in nanocrystalline WC–Co composites could result in a great increment of hardness but at the same time a little sacrifice of fracture toughness of the WC–Co cermets. Due to the presence of low melting point Co–P eutectic phase (1023 °C) in the binder phase, it could be predicated that the red hardness of the nano-WC–Co–P cermets will be decreased. But at moderate temperatures, the higher hardness and considerable fracture toughness of WC–Co–P nano-cermets would lead to much increment of wear resistance and tool life. Thereby, it is suggested that these P-doped WC–Co composites might have potential applications in the field of higher wear resistance required low speed cutting conditions. 4 Conclusions (1) With small amount of phosphorus (P) doped in nanocrystalline WC–Co matrix, the sinter activity of WC–Co nanocomposites was enhanced, the low temperature shrinkage and densification process was promoted, and the sintering temperature was decreased. Full density WC–7Co cermets were obtained at temperature as low as 1000 °C with only 0.3 wt.% P additions doped, which is 100 °C lower than that of the undoped counterparts in spark plasma sintering of the nanocomposites. (2) By phosphorus doping in WC–Co nanocomposites, the grain growth of the WC–Co cermets could be inhibited to some extent and WC–7Co–0.3P cermets with average WC grain size of 200 nm were achieved, which can be attributed to the lower sintering temperature resulting in a decrease of the grain boundary mobility. (3) The fully sintered WC–7Co–0.3P cermets exhibit much higher hardness, but at the same time little sacrifice of fracture toughness. These P-doped WC–Co composites might have potential applications in the field of higher wear resistance required low speed cutting conditions. (4) To control the grain growth of nanocystalline WC–Co composites by decreasing the sintering temperature through incorporation of P additions provide chemically-activated sintering of the nanocomposites is a new way of grain growth inhibition in WC–Co system, but need to be further investigated.

        "abstract": "Sol–gel silica antireflective (AR) coatings possess a high specific surface area that is more susceptible to be contaminated by absorption of contaminants from the environment, which will increase the refractive index and reduce the transmittance. Ammonia and γ-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (KH570) vapor treatment was employed to passivate the silica AR coating, thereby enhancing the environmental stability. The properties of the coatings were characterized with Fourier transfer infrared absorption spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, UV–Vis–NIR spectrometer, and contact angle measurement. The results showed that after the vapor treatment, the coatings became denser and the environmental stability was greatly improved. After being exposed to a humid environment (RH > 90%) and low-vacuum environment with intentionally induced organic contaminants for 60 days, the transmittance of the modified SiO2 coating decreased by only 0.08% and 0.2%, respectively. Meanwhile, the average transmittance decreased by only 0.02% after being rubbed for 1000 cycles, indicating that the co-treated coating also possessed a good abrasion resistance.",

        "abstract": "Linear filters are widely used in signal processing and in image processing, and the fast realization of large kernel filters has been an important research subject. Traditional fast algorithms try to decompose the initial kernel into the convolution of smaller kernels, and a lot of multiplications are still needed to realize all the convolutions with the small kernels. Box technique can realize the Gaussian filters with little multiplications, but it cannot realize linear filters other than the Gaussians. In the present paper, by use of the analysis on the scaled Spline functions, we propose the sum-box filter technique to approximately realize a given large kernel linear filter (even non Gaussian type) to a factor by the sum of the translated outputs of sum-box filters, requiring no multiplications. This original sum-box technique presented opens thus a new orientation for linear filter fast realization: realizing to a factor the convolution with a large filter kernel by additions only. From the viewpoint of computational complexity, this method is highly efficient in image and signal processing, in particular, for large filter kernels. Experimental results are reported.",

With sodium silicate as precursor, ethanol/ hexamethyldisiloxane/hydrochloric acid as surface modification agent, the crack-free and high hydrophobic silica aerogel monoliths was obtained possessing the properties as lowdensity (0.096 g/cm3), high surface area (651 m2/g), high hydrophobicity (147) and low thermal conductivity (0.0217 Wm/K). Silica aerogels maintained hydrophobic behavior up to 430 °C. After a thermal process changing from room temperature to 300 °C, the hydrophobicity remained unchanged (128), of which the porosity was 95.69% and specific density about 0.094 g/cm3. After high temperature treatment (300-500 °C), the density of final product decreased from 0.094 to 0.089 g/cm3 and porosity increased to 96.33%.With surface area of 466 m2/g, porosity of 91.21% and density about 0.113 g/cm3, silica aerogels were at a good state at 800 °C. Thermal conductivities at desired temperatureswere analyzed by the transient plane heat sourcemethod. Thermal conductivity coefficients of silica aerogel monoliths changed from 0.0217 to 0.0981 Wm/K as temperature increased to 800 °C, revealed an excellent heat insulation effect during thermal process. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.",

The Si - O - Zr, Zr - O bands were detected by FTIR. The result indicated that SiO 2 and ZrO2 integrated uniformly in the films on micro molecule magnitude. The negative tone gel films were irradiated with high pressure mercury lamp through mask and then leached in ethyl alcohol. The above process gave uniform surface-relief gratings of periods at 2.0μm.

In the model, a simple method of mass transfer between phases was proposed. Besides, the hydrodynamics, thermodynamics, and complex reversible chemical reaction were considered simultaneously. The model was validated by comparing with the previous experimental data which showed that simulated results can represent the experimental data with reasonable accuracy. Based on the model, the effects of gas velocity, liquid load and CO2 loading on the absorption rate, and enhancement factor were analyzed. Model results showed that the enhancement factor increased with a rising gas velocity while decreased with a rising liquid load or CO2 loading. The change of enhancement factor with CO2 loading was similar to that of equilibrium concentration of PZ which indicated that PZ was significant to the absorption process. Furthermore, the distributions of specie concentrations were discussed in detail. (c) 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 63: 2386-2393, 2017",

        "title": "Effect of yttrium on the glass-forming ability of Fe–Cr–Mo–C–B bulk amorphous alloys",
        "abstract": "New bulk metallic glasses are produced by substituting a few atomic percentages of iron with yttrium in the Fe 45− x Cr 16 Mo 16 C 18 B 5 Y x ( x = 0, 1, 2, 3) alloy systems. The study shows that the optimum yttrium content in the alloy for the best glass-forming ability is 2 at.%, and with this composition fully amorphous as-cast samples with a size of 6 mm in diameter can be produced by the copper mold casting. The mechanism for the effect of yttrium addition on the glass-forming ability of the Fe 45− x Cr 16 Mo 16 C 18 B 5 Y x ( x = 0, 1, 2, 3) alloys is discussed according to the effect of yttrium content in the alloy on the characteristic temperature values as measured by using DTA in this study. Furthermore, the compression tests of the bulk amorphous samples of Fe 43 Cr 16 Mo 16 C 18 B 5 Y 2 alloy show that the room temperature compressive strength of the amorphous alloy is approximately 1824 MPa. Keywords Bulk metallic glass Glass-forming ability Compression Minor alloying Thermal stability 1 Introduction The research on bulk amorphous steels with good mechanical properties, which are likely to make them superior to their crystalline counterparts and other bulk metallic glasses, has become more and more important in developing new materials [1,2] . It is well recognized that the low glass-forming ability (GFA) of Fe-based alloys has limited the potential of using them as engineering structural materials. For this reason, it is critically important to improve the GFA of Fe-based alloys and to understand the mechanisms of the effects of various factors on the amorphous phase formation during casting of such alloys. Although the mechanisms are not yet completely understood, previous work has shown that the addition of minor elements selected based on atomic radius ratio and the degree of structural mixing considerations is an effective method for improving the GFA of the alloys [3–10] . It has been reported that the addition of yttrium in Fe–Zr–Mo–Co–Al–Cr–B [11] , Fe–TM (TM = Mn, Mo, Ni)–B [12] , Fe–Mn–Cr–Mo–(Y, Ln)–C–B (Ln = Lanthanides) [13] (Fe–Cr–Co–Mo–Mn–C–B) 98.5 Y 1.5 [1] , Fe–Cr–Mo–C–B [2] and Fe–B [9] alloy systems is effective for enhancement of GFA of the base alloys. It is believed that the main reason for improving GFA is that yttrium can decrease the content of oxygen in the melt by formation of yttrium oxide leading to a high stability of the remaining melt, and that the presence of yttrium atoms can also increase the pack density of the alloy liquid because of their bigger size, thereby suppressing the nucleation and growth of crystalline phases during cooling. Pang et al. [14] studied the effect of the addition of Nb and Ta on the GFA and corrosion resistant of Fe–Cr–Mo–C–B alloys, and it was found that the addition of Nb and Ta could enhance the corrosion resistant and thermal stability of alloy. In this work, we studied the effect of addition of yttrium on the GFA and thermal stability of Fe–Cr–Mo–C–B alloy system and measured the compression properties of the glassy alloy with the best GFA. 2 Experiment methods Multicomponent alloys with compositions of Fe 45− x Cr 16 Mo 16 C 18 B 5 Y x ( x = 0, 1, 2, 3 at.%) were produced by arc melting under high purity argon atmosphere using industry grade materials, and casting them into the copper mold with different cavity diameters. The amorphous nature of the as-cast samples was checked using X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Philips Xpert system with Cu Kα radiation) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Philips CM200). The specimens for TEM observation were prepared by mechanical polishing samples to 100 μm in thickness followed by further thinning in a chemical solution. The as-cast amorphous samples were also analysed using difference thermal analysis (DTA) (Perkin-Elmer thermal analysis system) at a heating rate of 20 K/min. The uniaxial compression tests of as-cast samples were performed using cylindrical specimen with a diameter of 5 mm and a length of 10 mm. The ends of as-cast samples were carefully polished to make them flat and parallel. The initial strain rate for the compressive tests was 1 × 10 −3 s −1 . 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-cast Fe 45− x Cr 16 Mo 16 C 18 B 5 Y x ( x = 1, 2, 3 at.%) alloy samples with diameters of 3 or 6 mm under the facility conditions of this study. It was impossible to fabricate bulk amorphous sample out of the base Fe 45 Cr 16 Mo 16 C 18 B 5 alloy without yttrium addition, even with a sample diameter of 1 mm. With the substitution of 1 at.% iron by yttrium, a bulk amorphous rod of 2 mm in diameter can be produced using the copper mold casting technique. However, for this alloy, the XRD pattern ( Fig. 1 ) of the as-cast rod of 3 mm in diameter shows some sharp peaks corresponding to the η-Fe 2 C crystalline phase on the main halo peak, which indicates that the structure of 3 mm rod consists of a substantial amount of η-Fe 2 C crystalline phase in addition to the amorphous phase. When 2 at.% of iron is substituted by yttrium, the XRD pattern ( Fig. 1 ) of as-cast rod as large as 6 mm in diameter only shows a halo peak without sharp peaks corresponding to crystalline phases. In the meantime, when 3 at.% of iron is substituted by yttrium, the XRD pattern ( Fig. 1 ) of a rod of 3 mm in diameter exhibits some sharp peaks corresponding to η-Fe 2 C, YB 6 and other unknown crystalline phases. Based on above results, it can be concluded that the addition of yttrium of up to 2 at.% in place of iron can lead to a significantly improved GFA in the Fe 45− x Cr 16 Mo 16 C 18 B 5 Y x alloy system. To further confirm the amorphous structure of Fe 43 Cr 16 Mo 16 C 18 B 5 Y 2 samples, TEM examination was performed. As shown in Fig. 2 , the bright-field TEM image shows that there is no contrast of crystalline phases, and the corresponding selected area electron diffraction pattern only contains a single wide ring, which is a typical characteristic of amorphous structure. So the structure of Fe 43 Cr 16 Mo 16 C 18 B 5 Y 2 rod with 6 mm in diameter is fully amorphous according to the experiments results of XRD and TEM. These results prove that the addition of yttrium can effectively suppress the crystalline phase formation to enhance the GFA of the Fe–Cr–Mo–C–B alloy system. Similar results have also been obtained in other Fe-based bulk glassy alloy systems [9,11,12] . It is worthwhile to note that the optimum content of yttrium in Fe-based alloys having the best GFA usually lies between 2 and 5 at.% and the yttrium content beyond this range results in a decrease of GFA. The reason seems to be associated with the chemical concentration fluctuation required by formation of crystalline phases during cooling of the alloy liquid. The yttrium content of the alloy liquid in this range may make it difficult to satisfy the equilibrium composition requirement for possible formation of crystalline phases. In the meanwhile, it is the alloy liquid with a composition in this range can have a high atomic packing density due to the differences of radii of Y (2.27 Å), Mo (2.01 Å), Cr (1.85 Å), Fe (1.72 Å), B (1.17 Å) and C (0.91 Å) atoms, which can block the long-range atomic diffusion, thereby increase the difficulty of nucleation of crystalline phases and facilitate the formation of amorphous phase. The further more detailed investigation into the mechanisms of the effects of yttrium addition on the amorphous phase formation should be carried out at atomic scale by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Fig. 3 shows the DTA traces of the as-cast samples of the Fe 45− x Cr 16 Mo 16 C 18 B 5 Y x ( x = 1, 2, 3 at.%) alloys. The values of characteristic temperatures including glass transition temperature ( T g ), crystallization onset temperature ( T x ), melting temperature ( T m ) and liquidus temperature ( T l ) (as shown by the arrows in Fig. 3 ) are listed in Table 1 . From Fig. 3 , it can be seen that there is not much difference in the lower temperature sections of the three DTA traces corresponding to the different contents of yttrium, but the numbers and shapes of melting peaks in the higher temperature sections of the three DTA traces vary significantly. The DTA trace of the alloy with 1 at.% yttrium and that of the alloy with 3 at.% yttrium both exhibit two melting peaks, but the DTA trace of the alloy with 2 at.% yttrium has only one melting peak. This implies that the composition of the alloy with 2 at.% yttrium is close to an eutectic point of the multicomponent system leading to a higher GFA, compared to other alloys. Comparing the characteristic temperature values as listed in Table 1 , it can be observed that the liquidus temperatures ( T l ) of the alloy with 2 at.% yttrium is the lowest among four Fe 45− x Cr 16 Mo 16 C 18 B 5 Y x ( x = 0, 1, 2, 3 at.%) alloys. This means that the melt of the alloy with 2 at.% yttrium prior to solidification has the highest stability against crystallization, enabling the highest GFA. Moreover, the values of several GFA parameters, namely, T rg ( T g / T l ) [15] , γ ( T x /( T l + T g )) [16,17] and δ ( T x /( T l − T g )) [18] were calculated using the chacteristic temperature data and also listed in Table 1 . It is evident that the alloy with 2 at.% yttrium has the highest values of T rg , γ , and δ , confirming that this alloy indeed has the highest GFA among the Fe 45− x Cr 16 Mo 16 C 18 B 5 Y x ( x = 0, 1, 2, 3 at.%) alloys. To examine the mechanical behavior of the new bulk glassy Fe 43 Cr 16 Mo 16 C 18 B 5 Y 2 alloy, uniaxial compression tests were performed at room temperature. Fig. 4 shows the compression stress–stain curve of Fe 43 Cr 16 Mo 16 C 18 B 5 Y 2 amorphous rod with a diameter of 5 mm. It can be observed that there is no plastic deformation prior to the final fracture at an elastic strain of 1.7%, which implies that this glassy alloy is brittle in nature. The compressive fracture strength of the alloy was measured to be 1824 MPa which is much lower than those of other Fe-base bulk metallic glasses [19–21] . This might be due to the different bond nature among the atoms of the constitute elements [22] . Serrate flow was observed during deformation of the bulk glassy alloy as shown by the plateaus of the compressive stress–strain curve (circles shown in Fig. 4 ). This serrate flow might result from the propagation of shear bands during compression. The fracture surfaces of the samples show that the mode of compression fracture is purely brittle on macroscopic scale, but features indicating a certain amount of microscopic plastic deformation are obviously visible. The detailed investigation on the fracture behaviors of the alloys of this study will be presented elsewhere. 4 Conclusions It has been clearly demonstrated that proper substitution of a small fraction of iron by yttrium in the Fe 45 Cr 16 Mo 16 C 18 B 5 alloy system can significantly enhance the glass-forming ability. The optimum composition in terms of the highest GFA in the Fe-based alloy system of this study is the alloy with an yttrium content of 2 at.%. Fully amorphous rod with a diameter of up to 6 mm can be produced by the copper mold casting for the alloy with the optimum composition. The compressive fracture strength and elastic strain to fracture of the amorphous alloy with 2 at.% yttrium are approximately 1824 MPa and 1.7%, respectively. Acknowledgement One of the authors (J.

        "abstract": "In this paper, the investigation on the vapor liquid phase equilibrium (VLE) of the ternary system isobutane + trans-1,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene + trifluoroiodomethane was carried out. The measurements were performed using an apparatus based on the recirculation method at temperatures ranging from 243.150 to 283.150 K. Three models, namely PR-vdW, PR-BM, and PR-MHV2-NRTL, were employed to describe the VLE properties of the system concerned. PR-MHV2-NRTL was the best model, which gave the maximum average absolute pressure relative deviation of 0.85% and the average absolute vapor phase fraction deviation of 0.011. With the regressed binary parameters from ternary VLE data, the binary VLE were well-predicted. A maximum-point ternary azeotropic behavior was exhibited.",

Given its advantages in preparing monolithic aerogels, the DIS method is focally introduced. The DIS method uses the inorganic metal salt as precursor (avoiding the use of the metal alkoxide), as well as the low molecular weight polyacrylic acid as dispersant and template, followed by aging and supercritical fluid drying, to prepare various (multi-periods and multi-groups) well-formed and high-strength monolithic aerogels, combining the advantages of traditional sol-gel method and epoxide method. And the impurities of the aerogels can be easily removed via a thermal treatment. Based on those above, the DIS method is hopeful to be an accepted universal method on aerogels preparation and has good application prospects.",

The mixtures consisted of four mole fractions of R1234ze(E) from 0.4338 to 0.6356, corresponding to mass fractions of R1234ze(E) from 0.4613 to 0.6610. The experimental standard uncertainties in temperature, pressure, mole fraction, and density were estimated to be less than 5 mK, 200 Pa, 0.0003, and 0.05%, respectively. The Peng–Robinson (PR) equation of state with vdW one-fluid mixing rules and a truncated virial equation of state were employed to correlate the experimental data. The correlated results from different models are consistent with each other, and the virial model gives the best description of the experimental  pρTx  data with average absolute relative pressure and density deviations of 0.088% and 0.093%, respectively.",

This paper proposes a method using models with fuzzy primitives. It provides a simple and effective approach which can, by utilizing the knowledge about the universe and the context of the primitives, correct possible errors in primitive recognition and therefore improve the ability of the recognition system. In order to apply this method to the on line recognition of handwritten chinese ideographs, a method for feature extraction of graphisms, i.e. MLG method, is developed. Our system is implemented on a micro-computer Apple-II, the experiments for 200 chinese ideographs give satisfactory results.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the pathological basis of the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) changes of rabbit's sciatic nerve after traction injury. Methods: MR examination was performed before and 1 day, 3 days, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks after traction injury of sciatic nerve in 20 rabbits. The injured segment, the proximal and distal segments of the sciatic nerves were obtained for light microscopic and electric microscopic examination. Results: After injury, the MTR values of sciatic nerve descended obviously in earlier stage, and then gradually rose later. After injury, the sciatic nerve mainly manifested inflammation reaction and degeneration, including myelin disaggregation and axon lost in the early stage, exhibited Schwann cell proliferation and nerve fiber regeneration in the later stage. Differences of MTR values were dependent on the site along the same injured nerve, with the most pronounced of MTR values descended observed in the most severely damaged portion of the injured nerve. Conclusion: After traction injury of rabbit's sciatic nerve, the change of MTR can reflect the pathological change and the severity of injury, therefore can be regarded as assistant index for prognostic and therapeutic evaluation.",

        "abstract": "We report on how to tune the density of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowire arrays in a wide range (more than 5 orders of magnitude) in a low temperature (80 °C) solution-phase growth process. A model based on the coexistence of nanowire growth and etching of the ultrathin (<3.5 nm) ZnO seed-layer was proposed to explain the effect. It was demonstrated that when the seed-layer thickness changes from 1.5 to 3.5 nm, the nanowire density increases from 6.8 × 10 4 to 2.6 × 10 10 cm -2 . This significant variation of density with the seed-layer thickness was found to happen only when the layer thickness is within a few nanometers. If it is too thick (>3.5 nm), the variation is very narrow, and if it is too thin (<1.5 nm), no nanowires can grow. In addition, the density variation was accompanied by the change of both diameter and height of the nanowires, which leads to a change in aspect ratio. Both changes in density and aspect ratio were found to obviously affect the field emission characteristics. It was demonstrated that optimal conditions can be found to grow ZnO nanowire films with better field emission characteristics.",

In particular, during the period from supplying power to achieving the nominal precision, the temperature drift of FOG is much higher. In this paper, for reducing the drift in the startup process of FOG and shortening the time of FOG startup, a scheme based on Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural networks is designed to compensate the drift in the startup process of FOG. The RBF neural network use the two inputs and single output scheme that use the temperature of FOG and the temperature change rate as the inputs and use the drift of FOG as the output. In the room temperature, the RBF neural network is used to compensate for the startup process of FOG, and the results show that the method can effectively reduce the drift and startup time of the FOG. This method is used in a certain type of FOG North Finder and can greatly reduce the North Finder preparation time and improve the north-seeking accuracy. © 2012 IEEE.",

The electrical transport measurement has shown that the CuO nanowire has a typical conductivity of 7.8× 10-4 ( cm) -1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study has given the energy band gap of 1.2 eV with Fermi energy level close to the top of valence band, confirming that the CuO nanowire is p-type.

Based on the analysis, a simple method considering the solidification conditions and concaved solidification interface was proposed to predict the freckle formation. The method was verified with specimens and dummy blade under the experimental environments.

        "abstract": "To avoid the use of rare copper alkoxides, copper oxide aerogels were prepared using copper chloride, polyacrylic acid and propylene oxide via the dispersed inorganic sol–gel method, a supercritical fluid drying process and a 500 °C thermal treatment. The morphology and composition of the aerogel without thermal treatment (copper-based aerogel) and copper oxide aerogel were both characterized and analyzed. Based on studies of the gelation mechanism, it was demonstrated that polyacrylic acid guides the sol formation including providing a steric effect. Analysis of the thermal treatment process shows that the copper-based aerogel has four primary thermal reactions and the major composition of samples treated above 420 °C is monoclinic copper oxide.

It presents an ontology-based development process which relies on three levels of abstraction using ontologies: architecture layer, application layer and domain layer. The paper discusses the key roles of ontologies with respect to the various abstraction layers and their corresponding impact on the concomitant workproducts. In addition, a peer-to-peer-based service selecting and composing tool is suggested as a way of supporting the process. The paper presents the architecture of the proposed tool and illustrates the whole process in the development of a mobile banking application based on dynamic Web services. We proposed an ontology-based development approach for service oriented system.We proposed a three layer abstraction of ontology alignment.We proposed a semantic integration life cycle for semantic Web services.We applied our approach in the building QoS ontology for service and cloud systems.We developed multi-agent and peer-to-peer based service system to align ontologies.",

        "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a cellular transmembrane receptor, plays a key role in cell proliferation and is linked to a poor prognosis in various human cancers. In this study, we constructed Cetuximab-immunomicelles in which the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody was linked to poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PEG-PCL) nanomicelles that were loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) and superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO). The specific interactions between EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells (A431) and immunomicelles were observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and flow cytometry. Furthermore, the capacity of transporting SPIO into tumor cells using these immunomicelles was evaluated with a 1.5 T clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. It was found that the acquired MRI T2 signal intensity of A431 cells that were treated with the SPIO-loaded and antibody-functionalized micelles decreased significantly. Using the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, we also demonstrated that the immunomicelles inhibited cell proliferation more effectively than their nontargeting counterparts. Our results suggest that Cetuximab-immunomicelles are a useful delivery vehicle for DOX and SPIO to EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells in vitro and that Cetuximab-immunomicelles can serve as a MRI-visible and targeted drug delivery agent for better tumor imaging and therapy.",

The results showed that the γ′ precipitate was evolved gradually to be spherical in shape during ageing treatment. The γ′ particles size increased with the increase of ageing time or temperature. According to the measured diffusion activity energy of 130.9 kJ/mol, the growth kinetics equation of γ′ precipitate was obtained to be. r̄t 3-r̄0 3=9.4 × 1013·(t/T)·exp(-130.9/RT). The low activity energy was attributed to a great deal vacancies in spray formed superalloy. The migration energy of vacancy were obtained to be 0.21 eV and 1.16 eV, respectively, by electrical resistivity measurements for the spray formed superalloy and casted superalloy after ageing treatments. As a result, more vacancies were easily formed in spray formed superalloy than those in the casted alloy. The peak ageing time of the spray formed superalloy is remarkably shortened due to the diffusion acceleration of solute atoms.",

The results show that The induction heating power for unit volume in corner of small-size or medium-size plate-form part with big flakiness ratio is proportional to the square of corner radius during single-frequency electromagnetic shaping process. Obviously, the smaller the corner radius, the smaller the induction heating power of corner is, which causes the corner of part difficult to be melted. Under single frequency magnetic field condition, the corner and wide-face of plate-form part with big flakiness ratio can't be melted by electromagnetic field when the corner radius is smaller than skin depth of current flow. From the above fact the dual-frequency electromagnetic shaping for plate-form part with big flakiness ratio is proposed. At last, the heat resistant steel plate-form parts with big flakiness ratio and pre-designed cross-section were obtained by dual-frequency electromagnetic shaping.",

The study was designed to observe the characters of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in radiation induced temporal lobe encephylopathy following radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) and esti- mate its diagnostic value. Methods Conventional MR imaging and 1H-MRS examina- tions were performed in 39 temporal lobes of 23 NPC patients following radiotherapy for NPC and in 21 temporal lobes of 21 people healthy controls. Corresponding metabo- lites of brain including N-acetylaspartate (NAA), Creatine (Cr), Choline(Cho) and ratio among them were measured in the white matter on the temporal lobes. Results Obvi- ously decreased NAA, Cho and PCr were revealed in the patient group, meanwhile ratio of reduced NAA/Cho and elevated existed in the patient group. Significant differences were observed between patient and control group (p<0.05). Conclusion 1H-MRS can detect the metabolic changes of REP after radiotherapy for NPC and indicate that con- spicuous metabolic abnormalities were existe in REP. The new technique is conducted to accurate diagnosis of REP.",

Compared to the water-soluble SPIONs prepared by small molecular surfactant coating, the nonclustered SPIO-encapsulated PEG-PCL micelles (PEG-PCL-SPIONs) simultaneously display increased transversal (r2) and much decreased longitudinal (r1) magnetic resonance relaxivities, leading to high r 2/r1 ratios which make PEG-PCL-SPIONs highly sensitive MRI T2 contrast agents. Animal experiments are carried out by injecting the micelle solutions via a tail vein into nude mice bearing subcutaneous xenografts of human Bel 7402 hepatoma. Notably, the nonclustered SPIO-encapsulated micelles measuring 35 nm on average based on PEG4.3k-PCL1k display much slower liver accumulation implying prolonged circulation, compared to the clustered SPIO-encapsulated micelles (125 nm) based on PEG4.3k-PCL7.2k. Furthermore, injection of the small-sized and folate-targeted micelle, i.e. Fa-PEG4.3k-PCL1k-SPION, result in obviously shortened MRI T2 as well as much decreased MRI signal intensity within the tumor section, implying efficient accumulation of the micelles which is also demonstrated by prussian blue staining of the tumor tissue. Our results reveal the great potential of the nonclustered SPIO-encapsulated and small-sized micelle with active tumor-targeting function as an effective MRI probe for in vivo tumor detection. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.",

The degree of structure order varies with the powder size. The 11 μm to 18 μm powders show the largest peak magnetic entropy change (MEC). Increasing the degree of structure order tends to decrease the maximum MEC. Nevertheless, enhancement of refrigerant capacity and MEC (above 70 K) is achieved when the crystalline phase content is ∼50% (above 75 μm) in the 75 μm to 100 μm powders. Exponent n of the field dependence of MEC increases with the decrease in powder size above 22.5 K. The size dependence of the structure and properties is associated with the fact that a larger particle has a slower cooling rate and takes a longer time to form medium-to-long range ordered structures.",

The variations of x-ray diffraction patterns and Raman spectra of the powder with different annealing temperatures were studied. While being annealed at temperatures higher than 800°C, the powder can undergo a phase-transition process from cubic diamond to graphite. In addition, the size of nanodiamond crystallites decreased from ∼50 to ∼25 Å.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Among district heating technologies, gas-fired boiler has difficulty in recovering flue gas waste heat and conventional heat pump has poor performance at low ambient temperature. In the present work, a novel gas-fired absorption heat pump is proposed. High-grade sensible heat and low-grade latent heat of the flue gas is recovered in the solution preheater and intermediate evaporator successively. Moreover intermediate evaporation and absorption processes are introduced, and the intermediate pressure is adjusted according to the ambient temperature, to improve the system adaptability in cold regions. Simulation results show that the coefficient of performance (COP), primary energy efficiency and exergy efficiency are 1.69, 1.39 and 54.5% when the evaporation, supply and return water temperature are −15, 55 and 35 °C, respectively. The COP of the proposed system has 13% and 20% improvement compared to those of the single-effect absorption system with and without waste heat recovery. Furthermore, the proposed system has energy saving potential of 11.7% and 39.6%, and payback time of 2.9 and 2.5 years compared to the single-effect absorption heat pump and the gas-fired boiler, respectively. The proposed system is suitable to provide 50 kW close range district heating for a typical urban residential building, especially in cold regions.",

Differential scanning calorimetry and TEM studies show that smaller diameter BMG sample has higher free volume and less local atomic ordering. The wear experiments demonstrate that with the same chemical composition, the smaller BMG sample exhibits higher coefficient of friction, higher wear rate, and rougher worn surface than those of the larger ones. Compared with larger BMG sample, the faster cooling rate of the smaller sample results in looser atomic configuration with more free volume, which facilitates the formation of the shear bands, and thus leads to larger plasticity and lower wear resistance. The results provide more quantitative understanding on the relationship among the cooling rate, the local atomic ordering, and the wear performance of BMGs. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic properties and magnetocaloric effects (MCEs) of the intermetallic Gd 1-xHo xNiIn (x=0-1) compounds have been evaluated by magnetization and heat capacity measurements. The Curie temperature T C can be tuned from near 100 K to 20 K by substituting Ho for Gd atoms. In addition, all the compounds with Ho atoms undergo two successive magnetic transitions with the decrease of temperature: a paramagnetic (PM) to ferromagnetic (FM) transition around T C and a spin-reorientation (SR) transition around 7-9 K. It is found that both transitions contribute to the magnetic entropy change (ΔS M). For a field change of 5 T, the maximum values of -ΔS M for Gd 0.4Ho 0.6NiIn are 6 J/kg K at T t=9 K and 10 J/kg K at T C=52 K, respectively. These two -ΔS M peaks overlap partly and result in a wide working temperature range of MCE, and thus leading to the largest RC value of 443 J/kg in the Gd 1-xHo xNiIn system. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, an adsorption material with high CO adsorption capability is urgently needed. In this study, carbon xerogels (CXs) doped with CuCl were prepared via a sol-gel method and a facile soaking process. The CuCl-doped CXs show the highest CO adsorption capacity of 12.04 cc/g, which is much higher than those of the undoped CXs and activated carbon. Such a high adsorption capacity of the CuCl-doped CXs is not only because of their high porosity but also because of the chemical adsorption induced by CuCl. Moreover, these CuCl-doped CXs exhibit high desorption rate (∼79%), which is beneficial for repeatability.",

        "abstract": "Understanding business-IT strategy misalignment is an increasingly important area of research in digitalisation of different business sectors. However, there is currently a dearth of research investigations of misalignment between business and IT strategic objectives in public-sector organisations. Considering the nature of business, the structure of organisation, and the organisational resources of public-sector organisations, the investigation of business-IT misalignment can significantly enrich our theoretical exemplification of the relationship between business and IT in the public sector. Moreover, it provides some insights for managers to identify and avoid the possible pitfalls during the IT implementation process. Anchoring on the strategic alignment model, this research aims to identify and analyse the factors that contribute to business/IT strategy misalignment in Saudi Arabian public-sector organisations. Using a qualitative study design that included semi-structured interviews in five public-sector organisations in Saudi Arabia, our findings indicate that the human, operational, and IT system factors lead to business-IT strategy misalignment. This study also finds that those practical approaches for avoiding the misalignment in Saudi public-sector organisations sometimes lack structure and consistency.",

Due to their high surface area, electrically conducting network and chemical inertness, carbon aerogels can be considered ideal electrodes in rechargeable batteries. In this paper the optimization of the preparation and structure controlling of carbon aerogels are studied. The influence of preparation conditions on the structural properties of carbon aerogels are investigated by scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption and X-ray diffraction measurements. Carbon electrodes are prepared using carbon aerogels powders and binder, with the carbon aerogel electrode as the anode and with lithium metal foil as the cathode, cells are made. Electrochemical measurements of the lithium intercalation properties for carbon aerogels are performed under high-purity argon in a glove box. The model cells show that the capacity for the first cycle and the rechargeable capacity are all very high, but the ratio of the rechargeable capacity to the total capacity (first cycle) is about 0.3 to 0.4.",

Methods : 20 patients planned to surgery in the area of cerebellopontine angle underwent 64-slice spiral CT angiography. The obtained thin-slice images were reformatted by using maximum intensity projection,curved planar reformation and volume rendering to evaluate anterior inferior cerebellar arteries. The visibility and morphological features of the anterior inferior cerebellar arteries were assessed.Results: 38 anterior inferior cerebellar arteries in 20 patients were visualized and all the 38 arteries arose from basilar artery. The mean diameter at starting point of the anterior inferior cerebellar arteries were measured as(1.19±0.66)mm, 86.8% of them penetrates between the ventral side of facial nerve and auditory nerve. Conclusion : 64-slice spiral CT angiography could accurately demonstrate the origin, caliber, course, morphological features of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery,so it’s helpful in discovering morphological features or abnormalities of anterior inferior cerebellar artery, offering us early and accurate clinical diagnosis and treatment guidance.",

Coating microstructure and mechanical properties were investigated through grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD), scanning electron microscopy, digital microscopy, nanoindentation, and nanoscratch test. GIXRD indicated that TiN coatings initially grew along the (111) and (200) planes, and then the intensity of the peaks decreased as the Ar/N2 gas flow ratio was reduced. TiN coatings exhibited a high hardness value (22.3–26.3 GPa). Coatings with a high hardness-to-modulus ratio (H/Er) were found to crack dramatically under low critical load. The depth of the nanoscratches decreased as the H/Er ratio was reduced, indicating that the wear resistance of the coatings increased as the Ar/N2 gas flow ratio was augmented. TiN coatings with high Ar/N2 gas flow ratio achieved high hardness value, excellent elastic recovery under low loads, high adhesive strength, and strong wear resistance.",

A magnetic entropy change ΔS = 7Jkg -1K-1 is observed for a magnetic field change from 0 to 5T. A large value of refrigerant capacity (RC) is found to be 330J/kg for fields ranging from 0 to 5T.

A total of 42  pρTx  data points over temperatures from (254.28 to 348.30) K and 89 isochoric specific heat capacity data points over temperatures from (255.48 to 347.55) K were obtained for liquid (R1234yf + R290) with mole fractions of R1234yf at (0.825, 0.607, 0.521 and 0.285). The standard uncertainties were estimated to be 10 mK for temperature, 5 kPa for pressure, 0.3% for density and 1.0% for isochoric specific heat capacity. The experimental  pρTx  data were correlated by an empirical Tait equation with average absolute relative deviation of 0.19%. A Helmholtz energy equation of state based on the multi-fluid approximations model was developed for (R1234yf + R290) using the present and available experimental data. Eleven mixture rules are employed and the optimal Helmholtz energy equation of state calculates the density, VLE and isochoric specific heat capacity properties with sufficient accuracy. The compressed liquid density and isochoric specific heat capacity data in this work are well represented with average absolute relative deviation of 0.21% and 0.66%, respectively.",

The nucleotide oligomerization domain 2-autophagy genes autophagy 16-like 1 (NOD2-ATG16L1) signaling axis disorder contributes to the dysfunction of autophagy. This paper is focused on the relationship between contactin associated protein-like 3 (CNTNAP3) and ATG16L1 expression in Crohn's disease. The results indicated that the expression of ATG16L1 is higher in some CD patients compared to normal controls. ATG16L1 was well correlated with the C-reactive protein (CRP) in some CD patients. In vitro study revealed that CNTNAP3 could upregulate the expression of ATG16L1 and increase autophagy vacuoles.",

        "abstract": "In GaAs based infrared detectors, a considerable part of the incident light will be reflected at the surface, thus it decreases the detectors sensitivity considerably. In this paper, a TiO2 nanoporous coating was prepared successfully on the GaAs substrate by sol-gel method. The optical parameters of the coating were also controlled successfully. It was proved that the coating could greatly improve the transmittance of the incident light, which agrees with the theoretical results quite well. In the 2.5–6.0 µm waveband, the maximum transmittance of GaAs substrate is 56%, while the transmittance of the GaAs substrate coated with a nanostructured TiO2 coating is about 94%.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To observe the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) morphological features of radiation\n encephalopathy (REP) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and investigate their diagnostic value.\n Methods: The MRI data of 160 lesions from 104 NPC patients with the diagnosis of temporal lobe REP\n were retrospectively analyzed. The MRI was performed after radiation therapy of NPC with an interval\n ranged from 8 months to 13 years. The imaging sequences included T1-weighted imaging and T2-weighted\n imaging. Additionally T1-weighted imaging with injection of the contrast agent of Gd-DTPA was performed\n in 111 lesions and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) was performed on 37 lesions, and among\n them, 2 cases were subjected to MR perfusion weighted imaging (PWI). Results: Unilateral temporal lobe\n was involved in 48 cases of REP, bilateral temporal lobe in 56 cases of REP respectively, with a total of\n 160 lesions. The REP in the white matter displayed hyper-intensity signal on T2-weighted imaging which\n could be homogenous, whereas areas with heterogeneous hypo-intensity signal could be seen in 59 of them\n otherwise with hyper-intensity signal, and 91 lesions of white matter were associated with gray matter\n lesions with an appearance of hypo-intensity signal on T1-weighted imaging and hyper-intensity signal on\n T2-weighted imaging. In 111 lesions with the Gd-DTPA enhanced T1-weigthed imaging, 91 showed the\n enhancement of brain parenchyma. Hemorrhage and hemosiderosis occurred in 5 lesions of REP. Conclusion:\n REP in NPC has a multiplicity of the imaging features on MRI, in addition to the common\n involvement of white matter, including other relatively frequent findings, such as the involvement of gray\n matter, hemorrhage, hemosiderosis and blood-brain barrier destruction, those could be clearly revealed on\n MRI.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays more and more data are being sequenced and accumulated in system biology, which brings the data analytics researchers to a brand new era, namely ‘big data’, to extract the inner relationship and knowledge from the huge amount of data. Bridging the gap between computational methodology and biology to accelerate the development of biology analytics has been a hot area. In this paper, we focus on these enormous amounts of data generated with the speedy development of high throughput technologies during the past decades, especially for protein-protein interactions, which are the critical molecular process in biology. Since pathogen-host protein-protein interactions are the major and basic problems for not only infectious diseases but also drug design, molecular level interactions between pathogen and host play very critical role for the study of infection mechanisms. In this paper, we built a basic framework for analyzing the specific problems about pathogen-host protein-protein interactions (PHPPI), meanwhile, we also presented the state-of-art deep learning method results on prediction of PHPPI comparing with other machine learning methods. Utilizing the evaluation methods, specifically by considering the high skewed imbalanced ratio and huge amount of data, we detailed the pipeline solution on both storing and learning for PHPPI. This work contributes as a basis for a further investigation of protein and protein-protein interactions, with the collaboration of data analytics results from the vast amount of data dispersedly available in biology literature.",

Phase analysis results show that silicon distributes mainly in tempered martensite and M6C carbides,but rarely in MC carbides. The content of silicon in tempered martensite of high-speed steel increases with the increasing silicon addition. The addition of silicon exerts a crucial role on the the lattice constant of ferrite in tempered martensite. For the case of 0.7 wt.% silicon addition,the alloy exhibits the maximum lattice constant. Mechanical property test results show that suitable silicon addition can improve the secondary hardening effects of M3∶2 high-speed steel. M3∶2 high-speed steel with 0.7 wt.% silicon addition possesses the excellent combination of high hardness and high bending strength after double tempering at 550 ℃.",

The reaction process, size distribution, morphology, and structure of particles have been characterized by UV/Visible absorption spectrophotometry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD). Results indicate that CTAB accelerates the reaction between silver ions and glucose, because it stabilizes H +.

        "abstract": "Cellular eutectic microstructures with fully lamellar morphology were observed in the directionally solidified Ni-31Al-32Cr-6Mo (at%) hypereutectic alloy at withdrawal rates of 15, 25 and 50 μm/s, but the morphologies of cellular microstructures did not change consecutively with increasing withdrawal rate. The growth interfaces were deep cellular at withdrawal rates of 15 and 50 μm/s, but it changed to be shallow cellular at rate of 25 μm/s. The reason is that the interface undercooling comes to minimum at the middle rate of 25 μm/s. If the interface undercooling decreases, the tendency of constitutional undercooling will be weaken. The small constitutional undercooling will increase the interface stability, so that the interface morphology changes from deep cellular to shallow cellular. The shallow cellular growth interface led to a perfect cellular eutectic microstructure, which was analogous to the planar eutectic microstructure. In this case, the widths of the intercellular regions were narrowest, no coarse or irregular plates existed at the cell boundaries, and the thicknesses of the lamellae were almost uniform. The properties of the alloy may be markedly improved. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic properties and magnetic entropy changes in LaFe 11.5Si1.5 have been investigated by partially substituting Pr by La. It is found that La1-xPrxFe 11.5Si1.5 compounds remain cubic NaZn13-type structures even when the Pr content is increased to 0.5, i.e. x = 0.5. Substitution of Pr for La leads to a reduction in both the crystal constant and the Curie temperature. A stepwise magnetic behaviour in the isothermal magnetization curves is observed, indicating that the characteristic of the itinerant electron metamagnetic (IEM) transition above TC becomes more prominent with the Pr content increasing. As a result, the magnetic entropy change is remarkably enhanced from 23.0 to 29.4 J/kg·K as the field changes from 0 to 5 T, with the value of x increasing from 0 to 0.5. It is more attractive that the magnetic entropy changes for all samples are shaped into high plateaus in a wide range of temperature, which is highly favourable for Ericsson-type magnetic refrigeration. © 2007 Chin.

Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of TLR4 and TLR9. Geimsa staining and rapid urea test were used for determine H. pylori infection.TLR4 was detected in gastric epithelium and monocytes/macrophages in superficial gastritis, atrophy/intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia or carcinoma. TLR9 was mainly accentuated in monocytes/macrophages. TLR4 positive cells in epithelium and in monocytes/macrophages with H. pylori infection were much more than those without H. pylori infection. Similar results were also found in TLR9. When gastric epithelium was accompanied with H. pylori infection, TLR4 was significant higher in superficial gastritis and atrophy/intestinal metaplasia groups compared with dysplasia and carcinoma groups. When gastric epithelium was infected by H. pylori, TLR9 was significant higher in carcinoma group compared with superficial gastritis, atrophy/intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia. TLR4 and TLR9 show significant correlation with the severity of inflammation.H. pylori infection was associated with increased expression of TLR4 and TLR9 in gastric mucosa. In superficial gastritis and atrophy/intestinal metaplasia the inflammation was predominately mediated by TLR4, while in gastric cancer the inflammation was mainly mediated by TLR9.",

The purpose of this study is to establish a stable focal cerebral ischemia model with a high survival rate in adult mice.One hundred twenty adult mice were randomly divided into 10 groups of 12 each to respectively undergo intraluminal suture occlusion, with suture insertion depths from 0.8 cm to maximum; thromboembolic occlusion; and hypoxic-ischemic injury with hypoxia exposure times from 30-120 minutes. Coronal brain T2-weighted images were obtained on a 7T scanner. The induced infarct volume and location were assessed and correlated with histologic TTC staining. One-day and 7-day survival rates were recorded.The infarct location was highly variable in the thromboembolic model, while it showed a cortex predominance in the intraluminal model with the suture insertion depth ≥1.4 cm, and the HI model with hypoxia exposure times ≥60 minutes (P = .001). The infarct volume in the intraluminal model with suture depths ≥1.4 cm (29.7 ± 3.3%, 35.4 ± 4.3%) and the HI model with the hypoxia exposure times ≥90 minutes (26.3 ± 4.1%, 33.4 ± 2.8%) were larger than other groups (9.7 ± 3.3%-20.9 ± 9.3%; P < .05). The HI group (72.5%) had higher 7-day survival rate than the intraluminal suture occlusion (28%) and thromboembolic occlusion groups (20%; P = .001).The HI injury model with a reproducible ishemia and high survival rate can be used for a longitudinal study of brain ischemia in adult mice.",

        "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the safety, feasibility and therapeutic outcome of surgical resection for centrally located hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC). Methods A total of 35 cases diagnosed as centrally located HCC were enrolled in this retrospective study, who underwent operations from January2007 to December 2011 at the Department of General Surgery, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Local ethical committee approval had been received and that the informed consent of all participating subjects was obtained. The patients included 31 males and 4 females with median age of 64 years old(range: 25-69 years old). Among three patients with HCC located in Couinaud segments Ⅳ and Ⅴ,2 cases received left hemihepatoectomy and 1 case received local resection. Among 11 patients with HCC located in Couinaud segments Ⅷ,7 cases underwent hepatic segmentectomy of Ⅷ and the other 4 cases underwent hepatic segmentectomy of Ⅶ and Ⅷ. Among seven patients with HCC located between the right anterior and posterior branch of portal vein,4 cases received hepatic segmentectomy of Ⅴ and Ⅵ and 3 cases received right hemihepatoectomy plus embolectomy. Two patients had HCC located between the left and right trunk of portal vein, the middle and right hepatic vein, inferior vena cava(IVC). These two cases received local resection and one of them underwent right and left liver split following resection. Among seven patients with HCC located in apical segment of IVC,2 cases received hepatic segmentectomy of Ⅵ and Ⅶ,2 cases received hepatic segmentectomy of Ⅶ and Ⅷ and the other 3 cases received hepatic segmentectomy of Ⅴ and Ⅵ. The volume of intraoperative blood loss and transfusion, operation time, blood loss control, intraoperative and postoperative complications as well as mortality were observed and recorded. All the patients were followed up and Lift Table method was applied to calculate the survival rate. Results All the 35 HCC patients received successful operations and no operative mortality was observed. No complications were observed such as air embolism and massive haemorrhage caused by IVC or rupture of hepatic vein. The intraoperative blood loss were 100-600 ml with the median volume of 280 ml and 5 cases received 2-4 U blood transfusion. The operating time was 135-265 min with the median time of 178 min. The blood loss control methods included 26 cases undergoing the first hepatic portal control(1-2 times hepatic occlusion with time of 15-35 minutes, median time of 24 minutes), 2 cases undergoing left hepatic portal control(olny one-time hepatic occlusion with time of 10, 15 minutes respectively), 4 cases undergoing the right hepatic portal control(2 times of occlusion with time of 20-38 minutes, median time of 28 minutes). The other 3 cases with right hemihepatoectomy had right branch of hepatic artery cut off and the right branch of portal vein blocked up. Four of the 35 patients received total hepatic vascular exclusion with the inferior vena cava blocking time 10-18(13) min for just once. The postoperative complications included 1 case with bile leakage, 4 cases with subdiaphragmatic effusion and 6 cases with right pleural effusion. All patients with complications were cured without haemorrhage and infections. The 1- and 3-year survival rates were 87.8% and 63.0% respectively. Conclusions Surgical resection is safe and effective for centrally located HCC. Appropriate techniques and blood loss control should be applied during the operation.",

        "abstract": "Directional solidification (DS) of Ti-43Al-3Si alloy with a polycrystalline seed has been studied under the conditions of different growth rates. DS ingots with fully lamellar microstruc-ture parallel to longitudinal axis (DS direction) were successfully obtained at a low growth rate of 60 mm/h. Increasing further the growth rate, the orientation of lamellar microstructure was no longer parallel to the DS direction and an angle of about 45°or 90°appeared between lamellar orientation and DS direction because of the variations of constitutional undercooling and temperature gradient. The distance between the transition point and the seed decreased with the increase of growth rate. Experiments also showed that the seeding process easily failed if the convection caused by electromagnetic stir was strong enough.",

        "title": "Low dielectric constant silica films with ordered nanoporous structure",
        "abstract": "Low-dielectric-constant (low- k ) materials are believed to be necessary to allow speed increases in integrated circuits. These materials are desirable to reduce the RC time constant of interconnect structures and to reduce the cross-talk between adjacent lines. A number of intensive researches have been conducted in this area, including non-fluorinated polymers, inorganic–organic hybrids, porous polymer and porous silica. Among them porous silica films are considered to be the most promising ones, because they usually have good chemical and thermal stability and are compatible with the silicon wafer and related materials used in existing IC technology. In this paper, a novel route to prepare low- k nanoporous SiO 2 films is reported. Silicate sols are prepared with the precursor Si(OC 2 H 5 ) 4 and surfactant cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) catalyzed by hydrochloric acid. The films are derived from dip-coating process. The refractive index and dielectric constant are measured with an ellipsometer and impedance analysis apparatus, which are smaller than 1.15 and 2.5 respectively. XRD and TEM patterns show that silica films derived from a mole ratio of CTAB/TEOS of 0.10 or 0.15 have typical mesoporous structures with a period of 5 nm and a pore size of 4 nm. A drag-wipe test shows that films with ordered porous structure have much better mechanical properties than those with disordered porosity. And hydrophobicity of silica films can be achieved by HMDS treatment and the contact angle of water to the surface of hydrophobic films can be up to 140°.",

The parameters including glass transition temperature, onset crystallization temperature, and supercooled liquid region associated with the thermal stability of this alloy were measured. It is found that, in the case of continuous heating, both the onset and peak crystallization temperatures exhibit a strong dependence of the heating rate. And this relationship can be fitted by first order exponential decay equation. In addition, the isothermal kinetics was studied by Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (JMA) equation, and the Avrami exponents were calculated to be in the range of 2.0 - 5.0. On the basis of the Avrami exponents, it can be concluded that the crystallization process is mainly dominated by three-dimensional nucleation and growth.",

SEM, BET and pore size distribution techniques were used to characterize the morphology and pore structure of the carbon aerogels. The structures of carbon aerogels are controlled from micro pore to macro pore by changing the concentration of catalyst and solvent. The size of the particles increases from less than 100 nm, 100-200 nm to 1-2 μm with R/C ratios increasing from 500, 1000 to 1500. The pore diameter of carbon aerogels decreases from 60 nm, 40 nm to 15 nm by increasing RF concentration from 30%, 40% to 50% while R/C ratio being 1000. The samples prepared by conventional drying have low density of 250-650 kg/m 3 and a high specific surface area of 250-550 m 2/g. The reaction mechanism of the sol-gel process and the way to dry aerogels at ambient pressure by enhancing material intensity and reducing capillary pressure were discussed.",

Main problems and controversy focus on those questions such as, Are all deep-water sandstone due to turbidity currents? Can Bouma sequence represent turbidite facies sequence? Were sheet- parallel continuous mounded turbidite sandstone deposits developed at the downdip direction of deep-water fan channels?Can deep-water fan sandstone be recognized using seismic data?The term “turbidite” excessively used made deep-water deposition is commonly regarded as origin of turbidity currents in deep-water fan modes,which results in many depositional geologist abandon old fan models they devoted . At present, deep-water deposition study faces to deny old cognition and establish new concept models. Petroleum industry made plenty of hydrocarbon discoveries using turbidity currents concept and related models in spite of it face great challenge now,and explorationist want to make more discoveries based on these concept. Therefore, science concept study cannot match with its application. Recognizing deep-water clastic deposit process、rheology and establishing depositional models are still the critical difficult point that main target is available predication of deepwater sandstone reservoir. At the same time, the scientific problems of deepwater deposittion cannot avoid in our country's deepwater hydrocarbon exploration.",

        "title": "A novel synthesis method of large-area tungsten oxide nanowires arrays and their field emission properties",
        "abstract": "Tungsten oxide is well known as an excellent semiconductor material and shows good electrochromic and photochromic properties [1-3]. Due to their high aspect ratio, tungsten oxide nanowires have attracted intensity interest as potential cold cathode materials recently[4]. However, there are some difficulties in the practical application of such nanowire arrays, for example, it is hard to prepare the good uniformity nanowires on large area substrate. In this paper, we report a very simple synthesis approach to fabricate tungsten oxide nanowire arrays on large area silicon substrate(10 × 15 mm2). A set of tungsten wires was used as the tungsten source, the silicon substrates were placed on a holder ∼2 mm beneath the wires. The chamber was first pumped to 1 × 10-2 Torr, then high purity argon was introduced to the chamber, and the tungsten wires were heated by passing current through them sequentially. When the temperature of tungsten wires was about 1200 , hot tungsten wires surface was oxidized by the remained oxygen of the vacuum chamber. As a result, the tungsten oxide NW arrays were grown on silicon substrates. It was catalyst free during the synthesis process. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that the nanowires were well aligned and vertically oriented to substrate surface, and the range of the nanowires diameter was in between 40 nm and 100 nm, the typical length of them about 3.5 μm (Fig l(a) and Fig l(b)). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses showed the component of the nanowires was W18O49 (Fig 2). The field emission measurement of the nanowire arrays showed the turn-on field with about 9 MV/m (Fig 3), which is defined as the macroscopic field required to produce a current density of 10 μA/cm2. The relative high turn-on fields maybe due to the electrostatic screening effect[5] caused by the high density of tungsten oxide nanowire arrays. © 2005 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Cloud computing services can boost the competitiveness of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) and leverage countriesu0027 economies. In the Australian context, there is an emerging trend that SMEs begin to embrace cloud technology in their traditional business activities. However, prior studies did not pay much attention to investigating the factors that influence the cloud computing adoption among Australian SMEs. To fill the research gap, this paper investigates the influential factors that affect the decision on adopting cloud computing services for Australian SMEs. Protocol data collected from fifteen firm-level semi-structured interviews with practitioners are presented and discussed. The protocol analysis indicates that various factors are important to the adoption of cloud computing services for Australian SMEs, such as security concerns, cost savings, and privacy due to geo-restrictions. Furthermore, this study confirms the insignificance of complexity and competitive pressure factors in the adoption of cloud computing among Australian SMEs. These findings have imperative implications to scholars and practitioners alike in the cloud computing research and applications areas.",

The saturation moments per formula unit are about 4.77 μB for Cd0.8 Cu0.2 Cr2 S4 and 4.41 μB for Cd0.7 Fe0.3 Cr2 S4. Magnetic transition in Cu- and Fe-doped samples are of second order in nature, and their Curie temperatures are TC =86 and 119 K, respectively. The maximum values of magnetic entropy change ΔS are found to be 5.1 and 5.4 Jkg K for Cd0.8 Cu0.2 Cr2 S4 and Cd0.7 Fe0.3 Cr2 S4 for a field change from 0 to 5 T, respectively. The significant ΔS suggests a potential of the sulfospinel as a magnetic refrigerant in the corresponding temperature range. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.",

        "abstract": "Ontology is specification of shared conceptualization and is building block of the semantic Web. Ontology building requires a detailed domain analysis that in turn requires financial resources, intensive domain knowledge and time. Most of industrial data is present in relational databases and a relational database schema represents a domain model. An ontology built from this schema can represent concepts and relationships that are present in domain of discourse. However, databases are not static and their schema evolves over time. Once a database schema is changed, these changes in schema should also be incorporated in ontology, generated from this database. The possible solution of regenerating a new ontology from changed database schema is not feasible because this will result in loss of manual changes of ontology. In this paper we present an approach that can be used to generate ontology from RDBs and to synchronize the generated ontology with changes occurred in the same database. We also present the prototypical implementation of the proposed approach as Protégé plug-in (i.e. DATAONTO) that can be used to generate ontology from database and to synchronize the ontology with the original database.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   As a common disease, hypertension (HTN) can lead to severe complications such as heart failure, renal failure and stroke. However, delayed diagnosis often happens because of no obvious symptoms in earlier stage. This paper addresses the issue through a novel cloud based auxiliary medical system for HTN. Nowadays, telemedicine has been used to diagnose and monitor HTN by sharing and consulting personal health status with doctors. Its high flexibility and processing ability have helped to reduce the overall cost of medical care and enhanced the control rate. Technically, telemedicine uses communication, holographic imaging and computer science to achieve the management for long-distance patients. This paper presents a novel system based on cloud computing and mobile Internet, which can provide telemedicine services for HTN patients. This system could help patients reduce costs, provide flexible communication platform and powerful computing services, and also automatically collect patients’ blood pressure status. As an auxiliary medical system, the data of patients can be processed with instant status feedbacks in the cloud environment, thus patients can actually know their current cardiac status and take necessary measures for efficient management. Also, related doctors could help patients resolve mild symptoms out of office.",

        "abstract": "A versatile sol-gel route (dispersed inorganic sol-gel, DIS method) was developed to prepare diverse monolithic gels and, ultimately, monolithic aerogels by simply using the reagents of inorganic salt solution, polyacrylic acid (PAA), and propylene oxide (PO). The preliminary study on the gelation processes of diverse ions including Li +, Al 3+, Ca 2+, Ti 4+, Cr 3+, Mn 2+, Fe 3+, Co 2+, Ni 2+, Cu 2+, Zn 2+, Zr 4+, Mo 5+, Cd 2+, and Ta 5+via both DIS and epoxide addition method (EA method, without adding PAA) indicates that PAA facilitates the formation of monolithic gels, instead of precipitates or cracking gels. The formation mechanism of DIS method was studied by comparing the hierarchic microstructure and pore texture of the chromia gels via DIS and EA method. Conversion of DIS-derived and EA-derived chromia gels to the aerogels was accomplished by the supercritical fluid drying in order to maintain the nanoporous structure of the gels. At last, it is suggested that PAA acts as both dispersant and template in the sol-gel reaction, which not only provides steric hindrance, but also guides the gelation during the gelation processes of hydration, hydrolysis, nucleation & growth, and crosslinkage & formation. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 2011.",

EuTi 0.875 Mn 0.125 O 3  compounds show the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic magnetic transition at  T   c   = 5.5 K. There are 15.48% Eu 2+  ions that change into Eu 3+ , because the concentrations of Mn 2+  and Mn 4+  are 7.74% and 4.76% in the EuTi 0.875 Mn 0.125 O 3  compounds. Although, the magnetic moments were decreased, the utilization of spin entropy of Eu 2+ : 4f 7  localized moments was improved. A giant reversible magnetocaloric effect was observed in EuTi 0.875 Mn 0.125 O 3  compounds. The maximum value of magnetic entropy change are (12.3 and 23.3 J/kg K), and the values of RC were evaluated to be 46 and 123 J/kg for a field change of 1 and 2 T, without thermal and field hysteresis loss. Therefore, the giant reversible MCE and large RC make the EuTi 0.875 Mn 0.125 O 3  compound a good candidate for magnetic refrigerant working at low-temperature and low-field.",

Results showed that the carbon aerogels are graphite-like amorphous materials with nano-skeleton networks formed by nanoparticles around 40-70 nm in diameter, whose specific surface area is up to 1300 m2·g-1 and lowest density about 0.050 g/cm3. The heat of condensation and the catalytic action of hydrochloric acid made it possible to form gels at room temperature. The high surface area and low density of the as-prepared carbon aerogels were ascribed to a strong interaction between acetonitrile and -OH groups by hydrogen bonding.",

        "abstract": "New Fe-based multicomponent amorphous alloys were developed recently based on empirical rules for large glass forming ability(GFA). In the present investigation, the master alloy ingot with the nominal composition of Fe61Co7Zr10Mo5W2B15 (mole fraction, %) was prepared by arc-melting under Ti-gettered Ar atmosphere. The Fe-based buttons with different transverse cross sections were fabricated by arc-melting method, and the d 2.5 mm Fe-based rods were manufactured by injection technique. Characterization of the ingots and the parameters associated with the thermal stability were carried out by X-ray diffractometry(XRD) and high temperature differential scanning calorimeter(DSC), respectively. The interval of the supercooled liquid region is 39 K for the Fe-based alloy. The GFA of Fe-based alloys is relatively lower, the buttons obtained are all crystallized. The Fe-based rod exhibites a high Vickers hardness up to HV 1329. In addition, an amorphous-crystalline transition layers are observed in the rod. This transition zone is caused by unhomogeneous temperature distribution and relatively lower GFA for Fe-based alloys.",

        "abstract": "A fault situation occurs to a service needs to be well analyzed and handled in order to ensure the reliability of composite service. The analysis can be driven by understanding the impact caused by the faulty service on the other services as well as the entire composition. Existing works have given less attention to this issue, in particular, the temporal impact situation caused by the fault. Thus, we propose an approach to analyzing the temporal impact and generating the impact region. The region can be utilized by the handling mechanism to prioritize the services to be repaired. The approach begins by estimating the updated temporal behavior of the composite service after the fault situation occurs, followed by identifying the potential candidates of the impact region. The concept of temporal negative impact is introduced to support the identification activity. Intuitively, the approach can assist in reducing the number of service changes in handling the fault situation.",

The alloy exhibited excellent glass forming ability (GFA) and could be cast into single glassy rod up to 3mm in diameter by copper mould casting method. The appropriate atomic-size mismatch, the large negative heat of mixing among constituent elements, and the possible formation of glassy HfSiO4 facilitated its superior GFA. The BMG also showed good mechanical properties with fracture strength of 1685MPa and Young's modulus of 95GPa as well as better corrosion resistance in both NaCl and Hank's solutions, compared with pure Ti and Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The above results demonstrated that the developed BMG is promising in biomedical applications. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

The typical sample ACAs-4, which possess pore volume of 2.73 cm3 g-1 and specific surface area of 2119 m2 g-1, exhibits high specific capacitances of 250 F g-1 and 198 F g-1 at the current densities of 0.5 A g-1 and 20 A g-1 respectively in 6 M KOH aqueous solution.

All patients underwent MRI examination before and after intravenous administration of contrast agent. [Results] There are 5 subtypes of retroperitoneal liposarcomas. Myxoid liposarcomas exhibited mainly low signal intensity on T1-weighted image, high signal intensity on T2-weighted image. At histologic analysis, myxoid liposarcoma consists of myxoid matrix as the predominant component and small amounts of mature fat. Enhanced solid tissues and thicked septa of myxoid liposarcoma were seen on post-contrast image. Among of well-differentiated liposarcomas, mature fatty components accounted for 75%, with enhanced tenuous septa and solid tissues on post-contrast images. Round-cell liposarcomas and pleomorphic liposarcomas exhibited soft-tissue tumor signal intensity without characteristic fat signal. Round cell liposarcoma appeared intratumoral hemorrhage. Dedifferentiated liposarcomas exhibited small amounts of fatty components with a clear demarcation between fat and nonadipose solid tissue on MR images.[Conclusion] Different subtypes of retroperitoneal liposarcomas exhibited varying MRI features, depending on their histological components. MRI can clearly demonstrate tumor’s shape, margin, internal components and surrounding tissues. MRI should be an ideal method in diagnosing retroperitoneal liposarcoma.",

It is capable of constructing a learning model with limited amount of data. Generally, it employs Monte Carlo algorithm (MC) to adjust weights of the underlying network. However, GVM is time-consuming at training and is not efficient when compared with other learning algorithm based on gradient descent learning. In this paper, we present a derivative-based Monte Carlo algorithm (DMC) to accelerate the training of GVM. Our experimental results indicate that DMC algorithm is faster than the original MC method. Specifically, the training time of our DMC algorithm in GVM for function fitting is also less than some gradient descent-based methods, in which we compare DMC with back-propagation neural network. Experimental results indicate that our algorithm is promising for training GVM.",

        "abstract": "Objective: The aim of the study was to explore the possibility of the rat Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) labeled with Gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) for cell tracking. Methods: jetPEI™-FluoF, a cationic polymer transfection reagent, conjugated with Gd-DTPA to form magnetic particles, was used to label MSCs. Electron microscopy was performed to detect the distribution of Gd-DTPA particles in MSCs, and labeling efficiency of Gd-DTPA particles on MSCs was evaluated using immunofluorescence. Viability and proliferation of labeled MSCs were evaluated using MTT assay. Apoptosis of labeled MSCs were evaluated using Hochest 33342 staining. Labeled MSCs was detected with T1-weighed MR imaging in vitro and in rat spinal cord. Results: Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of Gd-DTPA particles inside the cells. Labeling efficiency was approximately no less than 80%. MTT values of light absorption were 0. 1594±0.0084 for labeled MSCs and 0. 1675±0.0063 for unlabelled MSCs after 24 hours post labeling, which had no significant difference (P>0.05). Hochest 33342 staining showed that labeling did not influence the apoptosis of MSCs. Labeled MSCs demonstrated a significant increase signal intensity on TA-weighed MRI in vitro, and the signal intensity of labeled MSCs increased by 26.61% compared with the around spinal cord tissues (P<0.05). Conclusion: Rat MSCs could be labeled with Gd-DTPA particles without change the cell viability, proliferation and apoptosis. Obviously labeled MSCs can be imaged in vitro and in vivo in rat spinal cord tissues. Gd-DTPA shows no evident adverse effect on the function of labeled MSCs. Gd-DTPA can be used for the MR imaging tracking of labeled MSCs.",

        "abstract": "Solidification microstructure and growth interface morphology of directionally solidified Ni-31Al-32Cr-6Mo(at.%) hypereutectic alloy were studied. The experiments were carried out at higher temperature gradient of about 250 K cm -1 with different withdrawal rates of 4-500 μm s -1. When the withdrawal rate was less than 50 μm s -1, the primary Cr(Mo) dendrites were gradually eliminated through competitive growth between the primary phase and the eutectic phase. When the withdrawal rate exceeded 100 μm s -1, no primary phase formed, eutectic phase grew directly. Fully eutectic microstructures with lamellar morphology were observed at all withdrawal rates. With increasing withdrawal rate V, the growth interface changed from planar to cellular and then dendritic, the solidification microstructure also transformed from planar eutectic to two-phase cellular eutectic and dendritic eutectic. The microstructure was refined and the eutectic interlamellar spacing λ decreased according to the relationship of λ = 4.82V -0.42. Compared to the alloy at eutectic composition, the volume fraction of Cr(Mo) strengthening phase was increased obviously. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "This paper is a review of recent work done on accelerated stress tests in the study of PEM fuel cell durability, with a primary focus on the main components of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). The accelerated stressors for each component under different conditions are outlined, in an attempt to gain a detailed understanding of cell degradation with respect to microstructural change and performance attenuation in the perfluorosulfonic acid membrane, catalyst, and gas diffusion layers. Various techniques for evaluating the components' performance are presented, along with representative mitigation strategies. In addition, different degradation mechanisms proposed in recent publications are briefly reviewed.",

        "abstract": "Nano-architectured carbon aerogel/Ni(OH)2 composites have been prepared via a wet chemical approach that combines the sol–gel preparation of a highly porous carbon aerogel using microcrystalline cellulose, a low-cost and renewable polymer, as the carbon source and subsequent homogeneous deposition of Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles onto the backbone of the carbon aerogel via a two-step chemical precipitation process. The deposited Ni(OH)2 has small particle size (3–10 nm) and uniform dispersion and is well exposed to the electrolyte. The resulting composite possesses an interconnected, three-dimensional, high-surface-area (327 m2 g−1) nanostructure, which provides efficient transport of electrolyte ions and electrons and enables a fuller utilization of Ni(OH)2, thus leading to excellent electrochemical performance. The composite electrode exhibits high specific capacitance of 1906 and 1206 F g−1 at current density of 1 and 20 A g−1, respectively, which are much higher than those of Ni(OH)2. Moreover 89% capacitance is retained after 4000 cycles, implying a good cycling stability.",

The standard uncertainties of the temperature, pressure and composition were less than 5 mK, 0.0005 MPa, and 0.005, respectively. The experimental results were correlated by the Peng–Robison (PR) equation of state (EoS) with the Huron–Vidal (HV) mixing rule involving the non-random two-liquid (NRTL) activity coefficient model. The correlated results show good agreement with the experimental data. The average absolute relative deviations of pressure are between 0.20% and 0.35%, while the average absolute deviations of vapour phase mole fraction lay between 0.006 and 0.007. Azeotropic behaviour can be observed at four temperatures from (303.150 to 333.150) K, while zeotropic behaviour can be found at 343.150 K.",

The nanoparticles were evenly distributed on the substrate surface. The diameter of the nanoparticles is dependent of the deposition duration of the Au-Ag alloy thin film, and also the separation between the nanoparticles. The minimum and maximum diameters of the nanoparticles obtained so far are about 5 nm and 160 nm, respectively. Experimental evidences indicated that the formation of the hemispherical nanoparticles is due to the surface tensile stressing induced by the lattice expansion.

        "abstract": "Polymethylsilsesquioxane (PMSQ) aerogels have gained considerable attention due to their high transparency, good mechanical properties and low thermal conductivity. However, low-density PMSQ aerogels are difficult to obtain by ambient pressure drying due to irreversible shrinkage. Inspired by previous research, we speculate that reducing surface silanol groups could reduce irreversible shrinkage along with the skeleton-strengthening effect. In addition, extending the ageing process is expected to lead to increased density. Thus, in this paper, we applied a mature technique to modify the surfaces of PMSQ gels with terminal silane groups to reduce hydrophilic surface silanol groups without strengthening the skeletons. This surface modification process greatly reduced irreversible shrinkage and allowed the PMSQ gels to return to their original sizes, in accompany with the decrease of silanol group (NMR results as the direct evidence). This method exhibits extremely high efficiency in the preparation of crack-free, low-density and transparent PMSQ aerogels. The PMSQ aerogels dried at ambient pressure had a low density of 48 mg cm−3, low thermal conductivity (21.1 mW m−1 K−1), high transparency (81.3% at 550 nm), super-hydrophobicity (contact angle of 155°) and excellent mechanical properties. The proposed method will be useful for the industrial production of transparent insulating materials and has potential applications in space exploration.",

As a clinically frequent disease, it can affect individuals throughout their lives, with multiple complications. Unfortunately, traditional murine models are not efficient for the further study of IBD. Thus, effective and convenient animal models are needed. Zebrafish have been used as model organisms to investigate IBD because of their suggested highly genetic similarity to humans and their superiority as laboratory models. The zebrafish model has been used to study the composition of intestinal microbiota, novel genes and therapeutic approaches. The pathogenesis of IBD is still unclear and many risk factors remain unidentified. In this review, we compare traditional murine models and zebrafish models in terms of advantages, pathogenesis and drug discovery screening for IBD. We also review the progress and deficiencies of the zebrafish model for scientific applications.",

        "abstract": "Mining big data often requires tremendous computational resources. This has become a major obstacle to broad applications of big data analytics. Cloud computing allows data scientists to access computational resources on-demand for building their big data analytics solutions in the cloud. However, the monetary cost of mining big data in the cloud can still be unexpectedly high. For example, running 100 m4-xlarge Amazon EC2 instances for a month costs approximately $17,495.00. On this ground, it is a critical issue to analyze the cost effectiveness of big data mining in the cloud, i.e., how to achieve a sufficiently satisfactory result at the lowest possible computation cost. In certain big data mining scenarios, 100% accuracy is unnecessary. Instead, it is often more preferable to achieve a sufficient accuracy, e.g., 99%, at a much lower cost, e.g., 10%, than the cost of achieving the 100% accuracy. In this paper, we explore and demonstrate the cost effectiveness of big data mining with a case study using well known k-means. With the case study, we find that achieving 99% accuracy only needs 0.32%-46.17% computation cost of 100% accuracy. This finding lays the cornerstone for cost-effective big data mining in a variety of domains.",

The thermal conductivity measurement of the silica aerogels was determined using the transient hot-wire technique. The results show that TiO2 powders can be scattered homogeneously in the silica aerogels; the pore size of the TiO2 doped silica aerogels is 5 to approximately 70 nm, the average pore size (BJH) is about 20 nm and the size of the silica particles is 5 to approximately 10 nm; the peak of the pore size distribution of the TiO2 doped silica aerogels shortened with the increase of the TiO2 powders while some pores less than several nm emerged and the thermal conductivity of the TiO2 (20 wt%) doped silica aerogel is 0.035 wm-1K-1 at 831 K and 1 atm.",

Although numerous databases have been designed by collecting data either only from literature manually or together with prediction outcomes from computational models, there is currently not a comprehensive data service framework delivering better insights for these results. In this paper, we introduce a biological sequence data service towards delivering deeper insights and helping better biological experiments design. The service includes following major components: a comprehensive database for storing biological data, data analytics tools for analysing biological data, and computational models for delivering testable prediction outcomes. Specifically, we present this service in a framework for studies on host-pathogen interactions. The design of this framework aims to improve the understanding of host-pathogen interactions. The relationships of hierarchical databases and their working mechanism, specifically between PPIs and DDIs, are also presented in this framework. Finally, the preliminary and practical experiences of building computational model for prediction is discussed.",

To confirm those observations, we perform this prospective observational study to compare the efficacy and safety of low and standard doses of AZA in the treatment of active CD.This was a prospective, open-labeled observational study. Two hundred twenty-six active CD patients were divided into 2 groups and treated with AZA 1.5 or 2.0 mg/kg/d respectively, combined with steroid therapy. Patients were followed up for 96 weeks. The complete remission (CR) rate, response rate, relapse rate, and adverse effect rate were assessed at weeks 24, 48, and 96 by intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis.Azathioprine 1.5 mg/kg/d showed no significant difference compared with AZA 2 mg/kg/d in CR rate, response rate and relapse rate by ITT analysis at week 24, 48, or 96 (all P > .05). Their adverse effect rates had no significant difference either (P > .05). Up to 21.7% (49/226) of the patients reported adverse events and 69.4% (34/49) of them were myelosuppresion.Azathioprine 1.5 mg/kg/d combined with steroids is as effective as AZA 2.0 mg/kg/d to induce remission of active CD in the first 6 months, and to maintain remission of inactive CD in the first 2 years, without increasing the recurrence of active CD after clinical remission. The most common adverse effect is myelosuppression.",

The organic cylindrical RF aerogel was synthesized by using sol-gel process and micro-shaped method, the cylindrical CRF aerogel was prepared by pyrolyzing the cylindrical RF aerogel under the protection of nitrogen. The density and diameter of cylindrical CRF aerogel were about 250 mg·cm-3 and 730 μm. The dual-media CRF/CH target with the length of about 1 mm and inner diameter of 730 μm was formed by using dip-coating and micro-cutting process. The preparation process of cylindrical RF and CRF aerogel was discussed. The scanning electron microscope(SEM) was used to measure the microstructure of cylindrical RF and CRF aerogel and the interface between CH and CRF aerogel. The density homogeneity of the axis and diameter direction of cylindrical CRF aerogel was characterized by X-ray phase contrast image apparatus. The surface roughness of CH film was measured by Alpha-step 500 profiler. The influence factors on the thickness of CH film were investigated.",

The temperature of testing was maintained at 633 K, which is close to the glass transition temperature of the BMG. The samples had heat treatment at 676 K for different lengths of time applied prior to testing, which resulted in microstructural changes. Apparent viscosity during flow was derived from the creep measurements. The effect of crystalline volume fraction, temperature, and strain rate are considered. Finally, we have constructed a TTT diagram for this BMG spanning almost three decades of time and 650-690 K temperature range, showing transformation from glassy to crystalline solid as a function of volume fraction. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "With recent advances in mobile learning (m-learning), it is becoming possible for learning activities to occur everywhere. The learner model presented in our earlier work was partitioned into smaller elements in the form of learner profiles, which collectively represent the entire learning process. This paper presents an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for delivering adapted learning content to mobile learners. The ANFIS model was designed using trial and error based on various experiments. This study was conducted to illustrate that ANFIS is effective with hybrid learning, for the adaptation of learning content according to learners' needs. Study results show that ANFIS has been successfully implemented for learning content adaptation within different learning context scenarios. The performance of the ANFIS model was evaluated using standard error measurements which revealed the optimal setting necessary for better predictability. The MATLAB simulation results indicate that the performance of the ANFIS approach is valuable and easy to implement. The study results are based on analysis of different model settings; they confirm that the m-learning application is functional. However, it should be noted that an increase in the number of inputs being considered by the model will increase the system response time, and hence the delay for the mobile learner.",

To facilitate this, two efforts contributed the most in enabling the creation of ontologies: OWL-S from the US and WSMO in Europe. These two compete and promote their ontologies from the design perspective, reflecting their inventors' bias but not offering much help to Web service developers using them. To bypass existing biases and enable evaluation of ontologies expressed in these two languages, this paper provides a study of the two important facilitators, OWL-S and WSMO, surveying their usage in several SWS Projects and identifying their respective and outstanding gaps.

In this work, we used the aging process investigated by Haereid et al. to continuously adjust the fractal dimension of silica aerogel. The fractal structure of the silica aerogels were analyzed by small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). The SAXS measurements show linear increases in the volume fractal dimension (2.32–2.64) of the secondary particles with aging time (0–72 h). This linear behavior is due to the silica precipitated from the aging solution to the secondary particles is at a constant rate. In the meantime, the light transmittances was obtained by ultraviolet–Visible–infrared spectrophotometer, extinction coefficient were obtained by fitting the curve of light transmittances. We developed a new model to build a connection between the extinction coefficient and the fractal dimension of the silica aerogel obtained by SAXS. From new model, it was found it is due to the increases in volume fractal dimension ( D  f ) that result in increases of extinction coefficient and decreases of light transmittances. The optical transparency of silica aerogel is strongly affected by the volume fractal dimension ( D  f ) of the secondary particles of silica aerogel.",

        "abstract": "In order to improve broadcast performance in mobile Ad hoc networks, a broadcasting protocol that takes advantage of node location information (LAB) is proposed. A node using LAB, upon reception of a broadcasting packet, divides the adjacent area of previous node into grids, and then finds out the relay grids using location information from them to carry out rebroadcasting. Re-broadcast strategy is decided according to its own location. LAB has been evaluated against three other representative broadcasting protocols. The results showed that on condition of less overhead, higher packets delivery ratio and shorter end-to-end delay can be achieved with LAB.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Stability of lamellar structure of directionally solidified NiAl-28Cr-6Mo eutectic alloys was investigated at different withdrawal rates and temperatures. The result indicates that the lamellar structure has no significant change after various temperatures (900–1100 °C) at 2.5 μm/s. With increasing the withdrawal rate to 4.5 μm/s or 7.5 μm/s, no major change occurs in the lamellar structure at the temperature of up to 1000 °C, however, some little coarsening and migration of lamellar structure emerge at 1050 °C and 1100 °C. With increasing the withdrawal rate (decreasing the lamellar spacing), the stability of lamellar structure becomes poor. At the present experimental temperature (900–1100 °C, in particular, 1050 °C and 1100 °C), the migration, pinching off, coarsening, even spheroidization of Cr(Mo) phase are observed by mild etching. The deep etching and the observation of inclining 45° to growth direction improve the result about the pinching off and spheroidization of Cr(Mo) phase observed by mild etching. Actually, the local dissolution and the cylinderization of Cr(Mo) phase occur. The mechanism of lamellar degradation is discussed.",

        "abstract": "The successful synthesis of fullerene-doped silica aerogel by the sol-gel process followed by the supercritical drying technique is reported. The fullerenes (C 60 /C 70 ) can be embedded inside micropores linked by the silica skeleton and the fullerene structures were retained in the fabrication process as seen using mass spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The fulleren-doped composites were found to be able to emit intense visible light (2.26 eV) under Ar + laser (488 nm) excitation at room temperature. The luminescent intensity increased strongly with low doping of fullerenes (0.05 mol%), then decreased while the peak was red-shifted and finally quenched upon heavy doping (2.5 mol%). This phenomenon is explained as a result of the quantum confinement effect for fullerenes which produces emissions far above the inter-band gap of C 60 /C 70 .",

By polymerization reaction of resorcinol and formaldehyde and via a self-made flexible mould, a series of carbon aerogel unit sheets were obtained. Their thickness ranges from 100 to 580 μm and density ranges from 50 to 400 mg · cm -3. With low density (10 mg · cm -3) SiO 2 aerogel as the bonding agent, a 5-layer graded density carbon aerogel target was fabricated. This work was focused on the microstructure of C/SiO 2 aerogel interface. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray phase contrast imaging method were used to observe the monolithic structure of the multilayer target and characterize the surface and internal microstructure of its unit sheets. The results show that the thickness of the bonding agent is approximately 15 μm, far less than that of carbon aerogel sheets. In addition, the C/SiO 2 aerogel interface is smooth, and the formation of the target is homogeneous.",

        "title": "Experiment investigation of two-phase flow pattern transition and frictional pressure drop of R600a in a horizontal tube",
        "abstract": "With the growing concern of environment problems, there are urgent demands for environment-friendly refrigerants in the refrigeration industry. As a natural refrigerant, R600a not only has zero ozone depletion potential and quite low global warming potential, but also has better cooling performance than other refrigerants. Due to its good cooling performance and environment-friendly characteristics, R600a has been used as an alternative refrigerant in heat transfer applications such as refrigerators, freezers, and heat pumps. It is known that accurate prediction of two phase flow pattern transition and frictional pressure drop of R600a in a horizontal tube play an important role in design and optimization of refrigerators, freezers, and heat pumps. According to this issue, a detailed experimental study was carried out to investigate the two-phase flow pattern transition and frictional pressure drop characteristics of R600a in a smooth horizontal tube with an inner diameter of 6 mm. The experiments were performed at conditions covering saturation temperature from 282.4 to 304 K, mass fluxes from 67 to 194 kg/(m 2  s). Based on a high speed camera, four main flow regimes can be observed: plug flow, stratified-wavy flow, slug flow and annular flow. The flow map of R600a has been drawn and comparisons between the experimental data of flow patterns and transition lines in the literature have been made. The results showed that with the increase of mass flux, the inception of the annular flow regime occurs earlier. The intermittent flow regime takes place over a narrow range of vapor quality and annular flow regime occupies a wide range of vapor quality. In addition, the trend of Barbieri and Ong and Thome  I / A  transitions lines are consistent with the experimental data. However, both of them overestimate the inception of the annular flow regime. After taking the influence of vapor inertia, liquid viscous and surface tension forces into account, a modified Weber number  We  *  has been introduced to the new flow pattern transition model. Based on the relationship of  X   tt   and  We  * , a new correlation has been proposed and it can well fit with the experimental data of flow pattern. Furthermore, a detailed discuss of frictional pressure drop of annular flow and non-annular flow has been made. The results indicated that frictional pressure drop  increases with the increases of vapor quality. The tendency of frictional pressure drop presents different the changing laws in different flow regime. The frictional pressure drop increases slowly in the non-annular flow regime while it increases rapidly when the flow pattern turns into the annular flow regime. The reason is that the vapor-phase pressure drop often dominates the total two-phase frictional pressure drop. The annular flow regime owns higher void fraction than the non-annular flow regime. Nine classic prediction correlations of pressure drop were evaluated and the results showed that the correlation of Gronnerud and Muller-Steinhagen and Heck give the best fit to the experimental frictional pressure drop of annular flow and non-annular flow with a mean absolute relative deviation of 38.5% and 19.7% respectively.",

This aerogels with surface property controlled are prepared via sol-gel process with polyethoxydisiloxanes (E-40) used as precursor, and have typical porous structures dried at ambient pressure: high porosity (above 90 %), super specific surface area (about 1000 m2/g), low bulk density (down to 3.03 kg/m3) and average pore size is about 20 nm. This paper presents adsorption mechanisms in aerogels and illustrates that the adsorption capacity of aerogels is three or four times as much as that of activated carbon fiber (ACF) and granule of activated carbon (GAC). So SiO2 aerogels are potentially important to be used as absorbents being quite efficient to adsorb toxic substances.",

The nano-porous structure and IR absorption of the thin films were characterized by means of FE-SEM, AFM, SEM, FTIR, and ellipsometry, respectively. The experimental results have shown that the base/acid two-step catalysis can adjust the refractive index of the films from 1.18 to 1.41 rapidly and continuously. With a change of the experimental conditions, the frequency shift of the ω 4 (TO 3 ) peak of FTIR absorption to a lower wave number indicates a decrease in the average Si-O-Si bridging angle. A reduction of FWHM of the ω 4 peak reveals a narrow distribution of the Si-O-Si bridging angle. These results suggest that influence of the experimental conditions on the FTIR absorption of the nano-porous silica films is attributed to a change of silica particle shape and state of aggregation of the particles in the films.",

        "title": "The relations between ΔTx and the glass forming ability of bulk amorphous Zr–Cu–Ni–Al–Hf–Ti and Zr52.5Cu17.9Ni14.6Al10Ti5 alloys",
        "abstract": "The relative glass forming ability (GFA) of bulk amorphous Zr 60 Cu 20 Ni 8 Al 7 Hf 3 Ti 2 (A 1 ) and Zr 52.5 Cu 17.9 Ni 14.6 Al 10 Ti 5 (Vit105) alloys has been investigated by comparing the maximum thickness of amorphous region of wedge-shaped samples, as well as the evaluated critical cooling rates using differential thermal analysis (DTA). The results show that the maximum thickness of amorphous region of wedge-shaped samples are d m =2 mm for A 1 , d m =3.5 mm for Vit105, and the evaluated critical cooling rates are R c =33.5 and 4.5 K/s for A 1 and Vit105, respectively. It is suggested that the glass forming ability of A 1 is smaller than that of well known Vit105 alloy, though A 1 has the significant supercooled liquid region of over 140 K. Therefore, it is concluded that a large supercooled liquid region Δ T x does not necessarily mean good glass forming ability of an amorphous alloy. Keywords Amorphous materials Thermal analysis Calorimetry 1 Introduction Glass forming abilities of different alloys are usually described in terms of characteristic parameters of those alloys. Among them the critical cooling rate R c , defined as the cooling rate that is tangential to the “nose” of the continues–cooling–transition (CCT) curve, is a very direct and tangible one, but it is not convenient in using. For the critical cooling rate of the melt is susceptible to cooling process, especially to the processing method. Therefore, it is hard to determine in the actual cooling process because of many uncertainties, such as temperature changing, heterogeneous nucleation, etc. Containerless processing methods, such as electrostatic levitation (ESL) melting, are very effective alternatives for evaluation of the critical cooling rate of supercooled liquids [1] . However, the cooling condition of the levitative melt is far from that of actual casting. Consequently the results are not always comparable to the actual experiments. So some indirect parameters such as reduced glass transition temperature T rg and interval of supercooled liquid region Δ T x , were introduced to estimate the glass forming abilities of various alloy systems. Reduced transition temperature T rg is the ratio of glass transition temperature T g to melting point T m . It was pointed out by Turnbull et al. that when T rg ≥2/3, the amorphous state is easy to obtain, because T g is closely connected with the viscosity of the supercooled liquid, and at T g nearly all of the molten alloys has the constant viscosity of 10 13 P [2–6] , therefore a higher T g / T m value means faster increasing of the viscosity of melts when temperature decrease from T m to T g , and this results in the suppression of nucleating and growth in supercooled liquids. The temperature interval (Δ T x ) of the supercooled liquid region, defined by the difference between the glass transition temperature ( T g ) and crystallization temperature ( T x ), is another indirect parameter for bulk amorphous alloys [7] . Large Δ T x is considered to imply high thermal stability of the supercooled liquid against crystallization. It was reported that glass forming abilities increase with increasing Δ T x among many bulk alloy systems, such as Ln-, Zr-, Fe- and Mg-based alloys [8–12] . A new bulk amorphous alloy with nominal composition of Zr 60 Cu 20 Ni 8 Al 7 Hf 3 Ti 2 (A 1 ) was successfully produced by arc melting and copper mould casting method, the temperature interval of the supercooled liquid region Δ T x is as high as 144 K, probably the largest in all Be-free Zr-based bulk amorphous alloys. Meanwhile the reduced transition temperature T rg (= T g / T m ) of this alloy is only 0.60, smaller than that of well known Zr 52.5 Cu 17.9 Ni 14.6 Al 10 Ti 5 (Vit105) alloy. This seems to be inconsistent with the well established and widely accepted relations among Δ T x , T rg and the glass forming ability. So the purpose of this paper is to discuss the relations between Δ T x and GFA of A 1 by comparing to that of Vit105 alloy. 2 Experimental procedure Ingots of A 1 and Vit105 were prepared by arc melting the mixture of pure metals of Ni, Cu, Al (>99.9% in purity), and Zr, Ti, Hf (>99.7% in purity) on a water-cooled copper boat under argon atmosphere. Wedge-shaped samples with vertical angle of θ =13° were made by suck the melt into the copper mould shown in Fig. 1 . The amorphous structure was examined and confirmed by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Optical microscopy and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The specimens for optical microscopy were polished and then etched for 30 s at 298 K in a solution of 5%HF+10%HNO 3 aqueous. The thermal stability of the supercooled liquid was examined by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC, Perkin-Elmer Pyris I) at a heating rate of 0.67 K/s. The melting points ( T m ) of the alloys were determined by differential thermal analysis (DTA) at a scanning rate of 0.167 K/s. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 2 shows the DSC patterns of A 1 and Vit105 alloys. The thermal parameters derived from Fig. 2 and DTA patterns are given in Table 1 . It is seen from Fig. 2 and Table 1 that there is only one exothermic peak for A 1 in the DSC curve, and the Δ T x is as large as 144 K, but the reduced temperature T rg is only 0.60, comparatively lower than that of Vit105 alloy, which shows two peaks in its DSC curve and a reduced temperature T rg of 0.63, but a small Δ T x of 64 K. While exhibiting a large Δ T x along with a lower T rg , it is hard to determine whether the glass forming ability is large or small for A 1 alloy. In order to compare the relative glass forming ability of the two alloys, the wedge-shaped samples of the two alloys were produced under the same conditions. Fig. 3 shows the optical morphology of the etched wedge-shaped samples of A 1 and Vit105 alloys. The thickness at the boundary of the amorphous region and the crystalline region (defined as the maximum thickness d m in this paper) for A 1 and Vit105 is 2 mm and 3.5 mm, respectively. To ensure the exactness of the compared results of the two alloys, at least five wedge-shaped samples of each alloy were reproduced under the identical conditions, and the maximum thickness of the amorphous region shows the same result. Therefore, it is concluded that the relative glass forming ability of A 1 is smaller than that of Vit105. It is suggested that the actual glass forming ability of amorphous alloys are not always dependent on Δ T x . To confirm the above results, the critical cooling rate R c for the formation of the two alloys was evaluated from the relation [12] : (1) ln R= ln R c − b (T L −T XC ) 2 where R is the cooling rate and b the material constant. T L and T XC are the offset temperature of fusion and the onset temperature of solidification, respectively. By measuring T L upon melting at a constant heating rate and T XC upon cooling at different cooling rates R using differential thermal analysis, the critical cooling rate for glass formation R c and the constant b can be determined from the plot of ln( R ) against 1/( T L − T XC ) 2 . In present study, this method was applied to A 1 and Vit105 alloys. Typical DTA curves of A 1 and Vit105 alloys are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 , respectively. It is shown that A 1 alloy exhibit two endothermic peaks through upon melting and two exothermic peaks upon solidification, while Vit105 exhibit only one endothermic peak upon through melting and one exothermic peak upon solidification. It is inferred that the composition of Vit105 alloy is closer to the eutectic point of the multicomponent phase diagram, and implies a better glass forming ability. The measured T L and T XC at a fixed heating rate and different cooling rates for A 1 and Vit105 alloy are summarized in Table 2 . The corresponding plots of ln( R ) as a function of 1/( T L − T XC ) 2 are shown in Fig. 6 , and the resulting critical cooling rates obtained from Fig. 6 are 33.5 K/s for A 1 alloy and 4.5 K/s for Vit105 alloy, respectively. Li et al. [13,14] have reported that the critical section thickness for glass formation by wedge casting for Mg 65 Ni 20 Nd 15 is 3.5 mm, and the critical cooling rate was predicted to be 9.5 K/s from the kinetic theory of glass formation developed by Uhlmann. So the above evaluated critical cooling rates from Eq. (1) of 33.5 K/s for A 1 alloy, and 4.5 K/s for Vit105 alloy are applicable for comparing of their glass forming abilities. It is evident from both the wedge-shaped samples and the evaluated critical cooling rates that the glass forming ability of A 1 is smaller than that of Vit105 alloy. Therefore, the GFA of the two alloys are independent on the Δ T x . Considering that Δ T x is derived from the DSC curve during heating, which implies the thermal stability of the supercooled liquid against crystallization in the temperature range from T g to T x , but it is by no means inferred, that the supercooled liquid is also stable in temperature range from T m to T x . Whereas to reveal the glass forming tendency generally upon cooling of the melts, the old though not accurate parameter T rg is still useful. As pointed out by Johnson et al. [6] , T rg is a key parameter to determine the maximum homogeneous nucleating rates in the undercooled melt. It is well known that at T g , the viscosity ( η ) of nearly all kinds of supercooled liquids is as high as 10 13 P, so higher T rg means faster increasing of η with the decreasing of temperature. High η of the supercooled liquid results in difficulties of diffusion and rearrangement of atoms, thus suppressing crystallization and exhibiting large GFA. There is seldom exceptions of a high T rg but small glass forming ability alloys been found hitherto. In the present study, the T rg values of A 1 and Vit105 are approximately in accordance with the maximum thickness d m of the wedge-shaped samples. Exceptions of the inconsistency of Δ T x and GFA have been found among some other bulk amorphous systems [15] . So it seems that Δ T x is not inherently connected with GFA of bulk amorphous, and a large Δ T x should not be emphasized excessively in searching for new bulk amorphous alloys with good glass forming ability. 4 Conclusions The glass forming ability (GFA) of bulk amorphous Zr 60 Cu 20 Ni 8 Al 7 Hf 3 Ti 2 (A 1 ) and Zr 52.5 Cu 17.9 Ni 14.6 Al 10 Ti 5 (Vit105) alloys was investigated by two methods: the maximum thickness of the amorphous region in the wedge-shaped samples is 2 mm for A 1 and 3.5 mm for Vit105, and the evaluated critical cooling rates obtained using DTA is 33.5 K/s for A 1 and 4.5 K/s for Vit105. The above results show that the actual glass forming ability of A 1 is smaller than that of Vit105 alloy, though the former has a significant supercooled liquid region. Therefore, it is conclude that a large supercooled liquid region Δ T x does not always mean good glass forming ability of an amorphous alloy, thus as a parameter to indicate the thermal stability of the supercooled liquid, Δ T x should not be emphasized excessively in searching for new bulk amorphous alloys with large glass forming ability.

        "abstract": "Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic performance of quantitative parameters derived from dual-energy CT for the preoperative diagnosis of metastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in participants with breast cancer. Materials and Methods For this prospective study, dual-phase contrast agent-enhanced CT was performed in female participants with breast cancer from June 2015 to December 2017. Quantitative dual-energy CT parameters and morphologic parameters were compared between metastatic and nonmetastatic SLNs. The quantitative parameters were fitted to univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. The diagnostic role of morphologic and quantitative parameters was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic curves and compared by using the McNemar test. Results This study included 193 female participants (mean age, 47.6 years ± 10.1; age range, 22-79 years). Quantitative dual-energy CT parameters including slope of the spectral Hounsfield unit curve (λ) measured at both arterial and venous phases, normalized iodine concentration at both arterial and venous phase, and normalized effective atomic number at the venous phase were higher in metastatic than in nonmetastatic SLNs (P value range, ≤.001 to .031). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that venous phase λ (in Hounsfield units per kiloelectron-volt) was the best single parameter for the detection of metastatic SLNs. The accuracy of the venous phase λ for detecting metastatic SLNs was 90.5% on a per-lymph node basis and 87.0% on a per-patient basis. The accuracy and specificity at venous phase λ was higher than their counterparts in the morphologic parameters (P < .001). Conclusion Dual-energy CT is a complementary means for the preoperative identification of sentinel lymph nodes metastases in participants with breast cancer.",

Two techniques have been developed to create a high density of nanoprotrusions on substrate surfaces: (a) on silicon (Si) substrates using our patented chemical-etching technique, and (b) on aluminum (Al) film by following a special deposition procedure. The density of nanoprotrusions can be as high as 10 8/cm 2, and the mean roughness of the substrates is 2-30 nm. From a-D emitters, substrate surfaces with such nanoprotrusions can lower the field for emission.

Several foreign authors have reported that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best imaging diagnosis method. Howev, there was little report about this in China. This study was designed to investigate the diagnostic value of MRI in tumor involving brachial plexus.The MRI manifestations in 13 patients with tumor involving brachial plexus (including 3 neurofibromatosis, 4 Pancoast's tumor, 6 metastatic tumor; 8 confirmed pathologically, 2 confirmed by biopsy, 3 neurofibromatosis confirmed clinically) were analyzed retrospectively.In 3 patients with neurofibromatosis, 2 cases showed growing along brachial plexus and represented spindle-shape; 1 cases showed growing crushing and encircling brachial plexus and represented ball-shape. There were middle or poor even signals on T1WI, and overt high and high-low mixed signals on T2WI (intense with even or uneven after enhancement). All 4 cases of Pancoast's tumor infiltrated brachial plexus. In 6 cases of metastatic tumor, 5 cases represented that localized bump encircled and infiltrated brachial plexus. 1 case represented that the tumor tissue effusively infiltrate brachial plexus. No special manifestation was shown on MRI of Pancoast's tumor and metastatic tumor. There were the similar or lower signals on T1WI, and high signals on T2WI (intense with even or uneven after enhancement).The coronal position of T1WI could clearly represent the relationship between brachial plexus and tumor, the involving extent of brachial plexus. Therefore, MRI is a effective imaging method for diagnosis of primary or secondary tumor involving brachial plexus.",

A novel kind of V 2 O 5 aerogel materials, ambient dried V 2 O 5 aerogel films were reported in this paper. The films were deposited by the dip-coating method and dipped into acetone and cyclohexane by turn to exchange the solvent in the films. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction topography (XRD), ellipsometry, and electrochemical measurements were employed to characterize the aerogel films. The porosity of the aerogel films is 56%, 16% higher than that of the xerogel films when dried at 120 °C. The aerogel films have the higher capacity, as well as better reversibility than those of the xerogel films. The improvement of the capacity can be ascribed to the increase of porosity as well as the pore diameters after the solvent exchange.",

This depression is an “eye-shaped” tectonics in plane. It is composed of two fold zones in the south and north respectively. The northern one close to the main southern Tianshan Range is a southward thrusting fault-folding system. The most recent active fold in this system is the Kasangtuokai fold belt. The southern one close to the Tarim Basin is a northward thrust fault-fold system. The recent active folds in this system are the Qiulitage fault-fold belt and other young folds in its south, such as the Yaken fold. These two folding systems embrace the Baicheng Basin which likes an eyeball in the eyelids. The Kasangtuokai Fault with a length of 60km in the north and the Qiulitag Fault with the length over 200km in the south are the most important active faults in Kuqa depression. The younger and smaller folds in the south of Qiulitag anticline belt indicate the southward propagation of the thrust fault in Kuqa depression. The petroleum seismic profiles show that the folding and faulting processes are controlled by the detachment fault between the sediment cover and the basement of the basin. The depth of the detachment fault is around 10km and possibly defines the main seismogenic zone in the depression area.",

        "abstract": "In recent years,the project of active fault prospecting in major cities has been widely carried out in China. However,active faults are usually developed in soft sediments,and sometimes do not leave any macroscopically observable trace. Therefore,even though fault-crossing trench is excavated,the key problems concerning the upward or downward propagation and the property of these obscured faults,as well as the mode of faulting and the time of the last faulting event can not be solved by macroscopic observation alone. In this paper,a microscopic observation method for resolving these problems is introduced through a case study of the active fault prospecting in Urumqi,Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Macroscopic observations have been carried out on 13 trenches and natural outcrops,and 53 samples have been systematically collected. Detailed micro-structural investigations have been carried out on 106 thin sections cut from the samples,while the grain-size analysis,particle size distribution(PSD)analysis and the statistic measurement of the angularity of the clastic grains from the samples have also been carried out. The problems concerning the mode of faulting,the occurrence of obscured fault,and whether the fault has cut through the overlying strata are resolved through the discovery of microscopic appearances of the faults,the finding of microstructures indicative of seismites,as well as the variation of angularity,grain-size and PSD of the clastic grains of the samples collected on and outside the fault. The results show that microscopic observation is an effective approach to the identification of obscured active faults in soft sediments,and it is widely applicable to the project of active fault prospecting in major cities currently carried out in China.",

In this paper, we present a steel quality control prediction system encompassing with real-world data as well as comprehensive data analysis results. The core process is cautiously designed as a regression problem, which is then best handled by grouping various learning algorithms with their massive resource of historical production datasets. The characteristics of the currently most popular learning models used in regression problem analysis are as well investigated and compared. The performance indicates our steel quality control prediction system based on ensemble machine learning model can offer promising result whilst delivering high usability for local manufacturers to address the production problem by aid of development of machine learning techniques.

The film is characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), ellipsometery, and the abrasion test, respectively. The experimental results show that nano porous structures of the films can be controlled artificially and refractive index of the films can be adjusted from 1.18 to 1.41 rapidly and continuously by employing the base/acid two-step catalytic processes. The abrasion and adhesion tests present that the two-step catalysis improves the ability of the scratch-resistance and adhesion obviously, and the mixed gas treatment further strengthens the silica network. The increase in strength is attributed to more Si-O-Si bond cross-linkages between silica particles formed by the two-step catalysis and the mixed gas treatment.",

The current aging treatment was found to be an efficient method to improve the field emission properties of α-FeO nanoflakes. The emission current density was largely enhanced from 0.05-5.70 mA cm under an applied electrical field of 7.8 MV m, and their threshold field decreased from than 11.0-6.6 MV m after the current aging treatment. The mechanism of the improvement in the field emission performance of α-FeO nanoflakes induced by the current aging treatment is discussed. α-FeO nanostructures with various morphologies were synthesized by adjusting the growth temperatures between 300 °C-450 °C to optimize their morphologies. α-FeO nanoflakes synthesized at 350 °C were superior field emitters with a low threshold field of 5.1 MV m, high current density of 63.4 mA cm, and stable emission, which demonstrated that α-FeO nanoflakes could be a promising material for application as field emitters.",

        "abstract": "In the provision of dynamic data-intensive services, the cost and response time of data sets as well as the states of services may change over time. An ant colony system for this problem is studied in this paper. Specifically, we consider changing the QoS attributes of services and replacing a certain number of services with new ones at different frequencies. In order to adapt the ant colony system to handle the dynamic scenarios, several pheromone modification strategies in reaction to changes of the optimization scenarios are investigated. The aim of the strategies is to find a balance between preserving enough old pheromone information to speed up the search process, and resetting enough new pheromone information to facilitate the ants to find a new solution for the changed scenarios. The strategies differ in their degree of reinitialized pheromone values with respect to the information that has been used to decide the amount of pheromone values. Moreover, the behaviors of different strategies for modifying pheromone information are compared.",

This paper presents the vapour liquid phase equilibrium and vapour liquid liquid phase equilibrium data of (ammonia + 3,3,3-tetrafluoroprop-1-ene) system at temperature from 243.150 K to 283.150 K. The vapour pressures of 3,3,3-tetrafluoroprop-1-ene were compared with Refprop 9.1, and the maximum deviation of pressure is 0.0007 MPa. The VLE and VLLE data were regressed by the PR-MHV2-NRTL model. Good reproduction was shown with the maximum RT = 0.009 K, Rp = 0.0040 MPa, Rx = 0.013 and Ry = 0.013. The homogeneous or heterogeneous azeotropic behaviours were found for the systems concerned over the temperature ranges investigated. The present results suggest that the volumetric refrigeration capacity of (ammonia + 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoroprop-1-ene) azeotropic mixture is 15% higher than that of ammonia and 79% higher than that of 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoroprop-1-ene.",

        "abstract": "Herein, a robust and homogeneous porous poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/graphene (PEDOT/graphene) thin film surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization (SALDI) functional platform was prepared through a rapid and facile in-situ photopolymerization method. The graphene-embedded PEDOT skeleton well circumvented the aggregation-related problems in the traditional carbon-based SALDI method which combined with time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF MS). As a result, the reproducibility and quantitative capacity of the SALDI platform were significantly improved. Furthermore, the highly efficient adsorption performance of the PEDOT/graphene thin film was demonstrated in terms of in vitro and in vivo solid-phase microextraction (SPME) extraction. It showed that porous morphology with abundant graphene doping favored the adsorption and enrichment of target analytes. Owing to the excellent adsorption capability of the PEDOT/graphene thin film and the inherent strong laser absorption ability of graphene, expected SALDI effect (3-13 times higher than the commercial nanomaterial-assisted LDI plate) and quantitative analysis (linear range 0.5-100 μg L) of the PEDOT/graphene functional surfaces were achieved. As for the real-world applications, we deployed the PEDOT/graphene thin film SALDI platform for the analysis of five estrogens in biological samples at microliter-volume level, without tedious sample preparation procedures. Satisfactory recoveries ranging from 60.6% to 99.0% were obtained. The present study suggested that the graphene-embedded PEDOT skeleton with porous morphology would be developed as promising coating for the adsorption of analytes of interest. Additionally, the combination of PEDOT with graphene not only expanded the application fields of PEDOT, but also offered an efficient strategy for preparing homogeneous functional surfaces to realize the quantitative analysis in SALDI method.",

Subjects included 27 male and 32 female patients between 13 and 81 years of age, with a mean age of 60.3 years. The clinical outcomes were categorized according to whether relapse or metastasis occurred within 2 years after therapy. The association between the clinical outcome and radiologic factors including tumour size, margin, shape, local tumour invasiveness, regional lymph node involvement, number of involvement sites, and contrast enhancement patterns was determined using univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis.Radiologic factors including tumour size, margin, shape, and local tumour invasiveness were associated with poor clinical outcomes, as determined by univariate analysis (P < 0.05). Only the lesion margin category (ill-defined) remained an independent risk factor for clinical outcome in multivariate logistic regression analysis, with an OR of 8.14 (P < 0.05).Ill-defined margin of the primary lesion was indicative of unfavourable survival outcome for patients with extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the head and neck region.• Tumour size, margin, shape and local tumour invasiveness were prognostically relevant. • Tumour margin was an independent risk factor for clinical outcome. • Ill-defined margin of primary lesion was indicative of unfavourable survival outcome.",

        "abstract": "The application of filament wound pressure vessel in the aerospace and civil domain is becoming a hot point in the study nowadays.Reducing the structure weight is of much significance to its performance and costs.To meet the high requirement of structural design and safety evaluation for the pressure vessel,the traditional safety coefficient design was substituted by the reliability design in its structural design with the application of the statistical principle and the same failure probability,based on the stress-intensity interference model.Eight pressure vessels are produced with the material system of E-glass roving and epoxy resin by the same winding technique.Experimental results includes all the probabilistic variables,such as the fiber strength,winding angle,geometric size,burst strength and so on.The value derived from the reliability design(thickness of the winding fiber) is close to the experimental one and much smaller than that from the traditional design.The combination of the probabilistic characters of design variables with the structure design of the pressure vessel can realize the balance of safety and economy and provide the basis for the application and development of the reliability design in filament wound pressure vessel structure design.",

        "abstract": "Based on the analyses of electromagnetic pressure on melt and heat induced in melt, the ratio of heat to pressure Q 0/P m was defined. It was given that the relationships between Q 0/P m and thickness α , electromagnetic parameter μγ of melt and electric current frequency f under electromagnetic confinement and shaping process. If the value of Q 0/P m is big, any adjustment on melt shape will easily cause a variation of temperature in melt. In this situation, there appear a more sensitive interaction between shape and temperature field and a more narrow adjustment range for this process. Experiments on some thin plate samples with a cross-section of 6 mm × 18 mm have been done in two kinds of induction coils respectively. The results show that as the coil with a trumpet inside wall is used and the positions of melt top and S/L interface are properly selected, the melt periphery is nearly vertical and the temperature gradient ahead of S/L interface is high. On this condition, a more stable and wider coupling between shape and temperature field has been continuously maintained and samples with smooth surface and unidirectional crystals have been successfully obtained.",

However, the delivery of open education resources OERs is scarcely supported by the current online systems. In this research, the authors introduce an approach to bridge the gap by providing adaptive micro open education resources for individual learners to carry out learning activities in a short time span. They propose a framework for micro learning resource customization and a personalized learner model, which are supported by education data mining EDM and learning analysis LA. A service-oriented architecture for Micro Learning as a Service MLaaS is designed to integrate all necessary procedures together as a complete Service for delivering micro OERs, providing a platform for resource sharing and exchanging in peer-to-peer learning environment. Working principle of a key step, namely the computational decision-making of micro OER adaptation, is also introduced.",

        "abstract": "The drilling data, geophysical data in the north part of Baiyun Depression and ODP files were used to well-seismic analysis, strata correlation and seismic stratigraphic interpretation. The results showed that Baiyun Depression was in the continental shelf in the late Oligocene from 32.0 Ma to 23.8 Ma before present. The large-scale shallow-water continental delta sandstone and mudstone inter-bedding deposits of Zhuhai Formation were developed around Baiyun Depression, which is different from half-deep or deep water fine deposit since 23.8 Ma. At the same time, the upper surface (at 23.8 Ma) and lower surface (at 32.0 Ma) of Zhuhai Formation are two large unconformities created by two times of large-scale structural movement in the South China Sea and the transferring interfaces of sedimentary-tectonic-climate conditions. During deposition period of Zhuhai Formation, the continental-shelf slope break migrated from north to south till to the southern uplift belt in the Pearl River Mouth Basin, and the large progradational delta depositional systems was clesely correlative with the extensive regression of relative sea level changes in the late Oligocene. Zhuhai Formation in Baiyun Depression has good shallow marine delta reservoir-seal combination conditions, which is significant for petroleum exploration in deepwater area of Baiyun Depression.",

The photoreaction properties of a-IGZO TFTs are also sensitive to the oxygen-content-related absorption of the a-IGZO channel. With the lowest content of oxygen in the channel, the TFT has the largest photocurrent gain of 50 μA (Vg = 30 V; Vd = 10 V) and decrease in Vth ( Vth V) at a high light intensity. The light-induced change of TFT characteristics is totally reversible with the time constant for recovery of about 2.5 h.",

These values are both enhanced by more than 1 order. We attribute these intriguing properties to the good and long interbundle connections.

In order to optimize its interface character, sol-co-gelation technique was created to improve the interdiffusion and smooth out the density mutation via a self-built device. Finally, on the base of the device and sol-co-gelation technics, a continuous formation process was developed to fabricate the completely gradient density silica aerogel.

Methyltriethoxysilane (MTES) and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) were co-hydrolyzed in different molar ration and were used as precursors. The process was optimized by varying MTES / TEOS ration, sol aging, thermal treatment and dip-coating conditions to obtain good optical films with low refractive index. The infrared spectra of the films thus obtained indicated that they become hydrophobic with the introduction of the methyl groups. Contact angle values for optical hydrophobic films prepared are greater than 120 degree supplementing the result. The refractive indices and thickness of optical films are about 1.12-1.21 and about 300-440nm according to different MTES / TEOS ration of 0.2-0.8 using CTAB(2.5 wt %)at 400 degree thermal treatment by Ellipsometry. AFM of the films provide an estimate of the root-mean-square roughness of the surface to be 312(pm).The optical transmittance spectra and mechanical intensity measurement results showed that the films have good optical and mechanical properties. As a result, the moisture-resistant ability of the films was highly improved and the mechanical intensity was improved too.",

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) was added into silica sol to adjust the particle size. Two kinds of surface modification (sol treatment and film treatment respectively) by hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) were employed and compared. The particle size evolvement was measured by dynamic scattering particle size analyzer. The surface morphology, water contact angle, chemical compositions, and transmittance were characterized by atomic force microscope (AFM), contact angle instrument, transmittance, FTIR and UV-Vis-IR spectrophotometers. Results showed that addition of PEG increased the silica particle size and accordingly the film surface roughness, which gave rise to a significantly improved hydrophobicity. The surface modification was impacted by the particle size. Small particle size is good for sol treatment, while large particle size is good for film treatment. PEG-film after HMDS atmosphere treatment could present superhydrophobicity with water contact angle of 152°, and high transmittance was maintained at the same time.",

        "abstract": "Although various nanomaterials have been developed for cancer theranostics, there remains a key challenge for effective integration of therapeutic drugs and diagnostic agents into a single multicomponent nanoparticle via a simple and scalable approach. Moreover, the bottlenecks of nanoformulation in composition controllability, colloidal stability, drug loading capability and batch-to-batch repeatability currently still hinder the clinical translation of nanomedicine. Herein, we report a coordination-driven flash nanocomplexation (cFNC) process to achieve scalable fabrication of doxorubicin-based metal-phenolic nanoparticles (DITH) with a hyaluronic acid surface layer through efficient control of coordination reaction kinetics in a rapid turbulent mixing. The optimized DITH exhibited a small hydrodynamic diameter (84 nm), narrow size distribution, high drug loading capacity (26.6%), high reproducibility and pH-triggered drug release behaviors. The studies indicated that DITH significantly increased cellular endocytosis mediated by CD44+ receptor targeting and accelerated intracellular drug release owing to the sensitivity of DITH to environmental pH stimuli. Furthermore, guided by T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging function endowed by ferric ions, DITH exhibited prolonged blood circulation, enhanced tumor accumulation, improved therapeutic performance and decreased toxic side effects after intravenous injection in a MCF-7 tumor-bearing mice model. These results confirmed that the developed DITH is a promising vehicle for cancer theranostic applications, and our work provided a new strategy to promote the development of translational nanomedicine.",

        "abstract": "A polystyrene (CH)/carbonized resorcinol formaldehyde (CRF) dual-layer perturbation target for inertial confinement fusion hydrodynamic instability experiments was designed and fabricated. The target was composed of a perturbed CRF aerogel sheet and a CH layer. The detailed fabrication method consisted of three steps. The CRF aerogel sheet was first prepared by sol-gel and carbonization processes; the perturbation patterns were then introduced on the surface of the CRF aerogel sheet by a laser micro-machining process; finally, the CH layer was directly coated on the perturbation surface by a spin-coating process not only to avoid the use of a sticker but also to eliminate the gaps between the CH layer and the CRF aerogel sheet. A scanning electron microscope was used to investigate the surface morphology and microstructure of the CRF aerogel sheet. The parameters of the target, such as the perturbation period (T), perturbation amplitude (A), thickness of the CRF aerogel sheet (H 1) and thickness of the CH layer (H2), were characterized by a QC-5000 tool microscope. The cross-sectional photographs of the target showed that the CH layer and the CRF aerogel sheet adhered perfectly with each other. The influence of the laser micro-machining process on the microstructure of the CRF aerogel sheet was studied. T and A of the target were about 100 μm and 20 μm while H1 and H2 were about 250 μm and 30 μm, respectively. The total thickness and width of the target were about 260 μm and 250 μm, respectively. © 2011 IAEA, Vienna.",

        "abstract": "UV and vacuum treatment, as well as annealing, were tried to recover the gas sensing property of WO3 films. Results show that gas sensing films can partially recover one or two coloring and bleaching cycles if kept in vacuum condition. And UV irradiation can well recover several cycles. But heat treatment does not show any obvious effect on the gas sensing recovery. Furthermore, IR and XPS spectra were used to identify the mechanism of this improvement. Results reveal that changes of water content will reduce the desorption energy of hydrogen atom, which will accelerate the bleaching velocity.",

Experimental results showed that under certain conditions the height and profile of melt meniscus can be changed by adjusting the weight of liquid metal column and an ideal shape of melt meniscus with vertical side can be obtained. A decrease in diameter and an increase in height of meniscus also can be achieved by increasing the induction power. The insertion of screen apparently improved the meniscus shape, resulting in a better shape with a near vertical periphery and a flat top, restrained the surface flow, and therefore made the meniscus be stable. A restraint magnetic field almost eliminated the surface flow but gave no effect on the meniscus shape.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Considerable attention has recently been given to the new environment-friendly refrigerant of R1234ze(E) for applications such as heat pump and air-conditioning systems. In this study, an experiment was carried out to investigate two-phase flow patterns and flow transitions for R1234ze(E) in a smooth horizontal tube with an inner diameter of 6 mm. The experiments were performed at conditions covering saturation pressures from 0.215 to 0.415 MPa, mass fluxes from 130 to 258 kg/m 2  s and heat fluxes from 10.6 to 74.8 kW/m 2 . The influences of saturation pressure, mass flux and heat flux on flow pattern transition were analyzed. Six well-known flow maps have been compared with the observed flow patterns of R1234ze(E). The results indicated that none of them can predict all the flow pattern transitions well. Thus, three dimensionless numbers  K  1 ,  K  2  and  K  3  which represent the ratio of the evaporation momentum force to the inertia force, the evaporation momentum force to the surface tension force, and the shear force to the gravity force respectively were introduced. Based on dimensionless numbers  K  1 ,  K  2 ,  K  3  and  X  tt , a new flow pattern map for R1234ze(E) was proposed which could accurately predict the experimental data.",

The preparation of the target involved the synthesis of organic resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) aerogel. RF hydrosol was prepared via sol-gel process with resorcinol-formaldehyde-water system and catalyzed by sodium carbonate. Also, an airtight micro-mold was used in layer-by-layer gelation process. After gelation, the RF wet gel was demoulded in ethanol condition and substituted with ethanol one time per day for three days to remove the residual solution. The treated RF wet gel was converted to RF aerogel via vacuum drying after the residual solution was completely removed. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray phase contrast imaging instrument and surface area and porosity analyzer were used to characterize the composition, morphology, density, interlayer coupling and microstructure of the flyer target. A four-layer target with total thickness of about 120 μm and density of about 400-1200 mg/cm 3 was obtained and characterized in the experiment.",

Transmission electron microscopy shows that the nanowires are around 20 nm in diameter and around 2 μm in length. High resolution transmission electron microscopy shows that the nanowires are crystalline β-SiC. Raman spectra show the typical features of nano-SiC. A model based on vapor–liquid–solid process is proposed to explain our finding.",

It correlates essentially with many fundamental properties of amorphous materials. Despite its importance, the underlying mechanisms leading to the β relaxation have remained elusive. As natural heterogeneity, the original distributed free volume has been supposed to be associated with the activation of β relaxation in amorphous solids. However, there has been no direct experimental proof for this hypothesis. Here we used a colloidal glass to directly observe the β relaxation and free-volume distribution. We found a spatial correlation between the β relaxation and free volume. The large free volume regions were observed to possess a low-energy cost of relaxation-induced strain, indicating that the large free volume region presenting a low-energy barrier for structural relaxation benefits the β relaxation.",

Amorphous powders can be consolidated into compact bulk amorphous alloys through superplastic forming in the supercooled liquid region. Process parameters such as ram speed V e, extrusion pressure F, extrusion ratio r and the temperature rise ΔT e during extrusion that is generated by the work-induced heat have crucial effects on the formability of the alloys and their consequent properties. In contrast to the direct fabricating technique, the powder metallurgy technique can obtain amorphous alloys with larger sizes which are different from those alloys that possess relatively lower glass forming ability (GFA).",

        "abstract": "Targeted delivery is a highly desirable strategy to improve the diagnostic imaging and therapeutic outcome because of enhanced efficacy and reduced toxicity. In the current research, anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) and contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), herein superparamagnetic ion oxide Fe(3)O(4) (SPIO), were accommodated in the core of micelles self-assembled from amphiphilic block copolymer of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) with a targeting ligand (folate) attached to the distal ends of PEG (Folate-PEG-PCL). The in vitro tumor cell targeting efficacy of these folate functionalized and DOX/SPIO-loaded micelles (Folate-SPIO-DOX-Micelles) was evaluated upon observing cellular uptake of micelles by human hepatic carcinoma cells (Bel 7402 cells) which overexpresses surface receptors for folic acid. In the Prussian blue staining experiments, cells incubated with Folate-SPIO-DOX-Micelles showed much higher intracellular iron density than the cells incubated with the folate-free SPIO-DOX-Micelles. According to the flow cytometry data, cellular DOX uptake observed for the folate targeting micelle was about 2.5 fold higher than that for the non-targeting group. Furthermore, MTT assay showed that Folate-SPIO-DOX-Micelles effectively inhibited cell proliferation, while the folate-free SPIO-DOX-Micelles did not show the same feat at comparable DOX concentrations. The potential of Folate-SPIO-DOX-Micelle as a novel MRI-visible nanomedicine platform was assessed with a 1.5 T clinical MRI scanner. The acquired MRI T (2) signal intensity of cells treated with the folate targeting micelles decreased significantly. By contrast, T (2) signal did not show obvious decrease for cells treated with the folate-free micelles. Our results indicate that the multifunctional polymeric micelles, Folate-SPIO-DOX-Micelles, have better targeting tropism to the hepatic carcinoma cells in vitro than their non-targeting counterparts, and the cell targeting events of micelles can be monitored using a clinical MRI scanner.",

Moreover, the corrosion behaviors of amorphous alloy and stainless steel were compared in 1 mol/L HCl solution. The results of potentiodynamic polarization experiment show that the amorphous Fe41Co7Cr15Mo14C15B6Y2 alloy has excellent corrosion resistance in different concentration of HCl solutions and its anodic reaction has a passive character. With the concentration of the HCl solutions increasing, the corrosion resistance of the amorphous alloy decreases. The results of potentiodynamic polarization experiments in 1 mol/L HCl solution show that the corrosion potential of the amorphous alloy is higher and the corrosion current density is lower than those of stainless steel. EIS experimental results show that the Nyquist figures of amorphous alloy and stainless steel are both composed of one single semi-circle in the state of open circuit potential. But the amorphous alloy has a higher charge transfer reaction resistance than the stainless steel. This result is accord with that of potentiodynamic polarization. The present results demonstrate that the corrosion resistance of bulk amorphous Fe41Co7Cr15Mo14C15B6Y2 alloy is much better than stainless steel.",

Key compound 5 was readily obtained in four steps starting from oleanolic acid (OA; 1). Further modification based on pyrazolo triterpene 5 resulted in 17 novel pyrazolo pentacyclic triterpenes. All of the synthesized pyrazolo[4,3-b]oleanane derivatives were biologically assayed against rabbit muscle GPa. Within this series of compounds, pyrazole triterpene 19 (IC(50)=9.9 microM) exhibited more potent activity than the parent compound 1. Preliminary structure-activity relationship analysis of the pyrazolo[4,3-b]oleanane derivatives as GPa inhibitors is discussed.",

All imaging data were consensually evaluated by two radiologists to determine the lesion location, number, morphology, margin, signal intensity or CT density, lesion texture, contrast enhancement pattern and involvement of adjacent structures.There were 14 male and 1 female, with peripheral blood eosinophilia in all 14 patients. 13 patients were presented with a painless mass. 13 patients had lesions located in the head and neck related to the major salivary glands. 1 patient had lesion in groin. Subcutaneous fat diffuse atrophy around the tumor site was found in 11 patients. 9 patients had solitary mass and 6 patients had multiple masses. Most masses were ill-defined, but no specific density or signal patterns were found. Most patients exhibited enlarged or obviously enhanced abnormal lymph nodes but without necrosis.The characteristic distribution, morphology with enlarged draining lymphadenopathy, combined with the clinical features and laboratory examination enables a confident preoperative diagnosis of Kimura's disease.",

Our efforts focus on many technological factors, including film thickness, its refractive index, and transmittance as well as the depth and diffraction efficiency of the grating, to develop a new type of laser hologram anti-counterfeit materials. The film with the following technical specifications works well: film thickness is 1-2 μm, transmittance ≈ 90%, refractive index n=1.8-1.9, depth of the grating = 100 nm. The diffraction efficiency of the transparent laser hologram can be as high as 1.9. Moreover, good holographic images can be clearly seen in the transparent film.

        "title": "An experimental study on the mini pig model of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome]",
        "abstract": "A mini pig model for study of human obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) was established by altitude hypoxia. Eight mini pigs were randomly assigned to 3 groups, named A, B, and C. They were placed in a double-roomed altitude chamber. As control, Groups A lived in Room 2 and there was an altitude of sea level in it. Groups B and C were in Room 1 and the pressure in it was 53.9 KPa with an oxygen concentration of 10.0%-11.2%. All of these mini pigs were in their rooms for 6 hours per day. Pigs in Groups B were in the room for 12 consecutive days and sacrificed on the 13th day. Pigs in Groups A and C were executed on the 23rd day. The pharyngeal CT scanning and the defermination of respiratory pressure in pharynx oralis and saturation of arterial blood oxygen were conducted in all exprimental mini pigs before they were put in chamber and before they were put to death. The pharyngeal tissues of the executed pigs were pathologically examined. CT scanning revealed there was significant (P < 0.05) increase in mini pigs' posterior pharyngeal wall (8.8 +/- 1.1 vs 6.5 +/- 0.6) and lateral pharyngeal wall (8.1 +/- 0.2 vs 6.3 +/- 0.6) on the 13th day as compared with that before they were put in chamber, and there was also significant (P < 0.05) increase (9.2 +/- 1.2 vs 6.3 +/- 0.7; 8.9 +/- 0.7 vs 6.4 +/- 0.5) on the 23rd day. There was significant (P < 0.05) reduction in diameter from left to right at the hyoid bone level (7.6 +/- 1.4 vs 9.7 +/- 1.4) and in the anteroposterior diameter at the soft palace level (3.8+/-1.1 vs 6.5 +/- 1.3) on the 13th day as compared with that before the mini pigs were put in chamber, and there was also sinificant (P < 0.05) reduction (6.4 +/- 1.6 vs 9.3 +/- 1.5; 4.3 +/- 0.9 vs 5.9 +/- 0.8) on the 23rd day. There was significant reduction (P < 0.05) in anteroposterior diameter on the posterior area of hyoid bone (3.7 +/- 0.9 vs 6.4 +/- 0.6) on the 23rd day. A significant change (P < 0.05) was observed in respiratory pressure of pharynx oralis on the 23rd day (0.0755 Mv) when compared with that before the first day (0.0658 Mv) in chamber and no significant change was seen on the 13th day. The saturation of blood oxygen decreased from 96.3% to 87.0% on the 13th day (P < 0.05) and further descended to 88.5% on the 23rd day (P < 0.05), compared with that before the first day in chamber. Pathological examination showed. In Group A, the mucosa of pharynx is covered by nonkeratinized-stratified squamous epithelium, and the layer of submucosa is thin; the muscular layer has clear striations and less fat cells among muscular fibers. In Group B, the pharyngeal epithelium is cornified and proliferated. Edema and proliferation of connective tissue occur in submucosa, and the muscular layer is thick with unclear striations; local infiltration of fat cells can be observed among muscular fibers. The pathological changes were more serious in Group C than in Group B. The results suggest that the method of intermittent altitude hypoxia could make the pharyngeal tissue of mini pig remodel and change its muscular biomechanical properties into those similar to the performance of OSAS in human. Living in altitude hypoxia for 22 days, the mini pigs became ill with OSAS, thus the expected animal model has been established in this study and could be used in further researches on OSAS in patients.",

        "abstract": "The application of ontology in Web services context for dynamic discovery, autonomous composition, invocation and monitoring has been deemed as very promising in semantic Web based enterprise application integration and m-commerce. There are many initiatives aiming to realize pervasive services to enable effective enactment of better quality of services, such as sensitiveness on service locations. The traditional WSDL is hardly qualified enough to tackle new challenges such as accurate representation of the non-functional properties of services. Hence, OWL-S came up with an effectual approach to facilitating semantic service description, dynamic composition, on-the-fly execution, and many other tasks. In this paper, we propose a practical geographic ontology based on Geography Markup Language (GML) and extend OWL-S profile to formulate new geographic profiles. We also discuss specific scenarios where context-aware services invocation peers, which are advertised and coordinated via a newly designed GeoProfile, can be equipped with geographic information inherently to distinguish different peers.",

Methods Appearances of CT, MRI and clinical data in 5 cases with SEGA pathologically proved were analyzed retrospectively. Results All 5 cases in this group were accompanied with tuberous sclerosis. Based on CT findings, round-like nodules with slightly high density were appeared in the inter-ventricular foramen or frontal horn of lateral ventricle with clear border and uniform enhancement. The sub-ependymal node-like calcification and iso- or slight hypo-density lesions were seen in cortical and subcortical areas. On MRI, SEGA lesions appeared as round-like nodes with iso-intensity on T1-weighted imaging and slightly high signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging near the inter-ventricular foramen or frontal horn of lateral ventricle. The long T1 and slight long T2 lesions were also seen in the cortical and subcortical areas. Conclusion CT and MRI is the best imaging diagnostic methods for SEGA. The correct diagnosis can be developed in this way combined with patient’s typical clinical manifestations.",

This model can be used to describe the transient and steady-state performance losses. Several characteristics such as performance loss, contamination transient time constant and recovery process have also been introduced into the model. The obtained equations can be used to simulate and estimate the chemical and electrochemical reaction rate constants, and make some prediction about the severity of the contamination and the performance recoverability.",

        "abstract": "Straight crystalline copper sulphide (Cu2S) nanowire arrays have been grown by using a simple gas-solid reaction at room temperature. These were demonstrated to exhibit semiconductor properties. Field emission was observed at a field of ∼6MV/m, and its current-field characteristics deviate from Fowler-Nordheim theory, i.e., showing a nonlinear Fowler-Nordheim plot. The uniform emission from the whole arrays was observed using transparent anode technique, and their variation with applied field was recorded. The emission from individual nanowires was also studied using a field emission microscope, and was found to consist of a number of spatially resolved diffuse spots. Finally, stable emission current at different levels and over time was recorded. These findings indicate that semiconductor nanowires as cold cathode have a potential future, worthy of further comprehensive investigation. The technical importance of using semiconductor nanowires as cold cathode emitter is given. © 2002 American Institute of Physics.",

TEM and particle size analyzer were used to characterize the microstructure and particle size distribution of the HfO2 sols. It is found that the particle size in HfO2 sols can be controlled from about 3 nm to 100 nm via changing reaction parameters. The HfO2 and HfO2-PVP thin films were characterized by ellipsometer, atomic force microscope (AFM), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) respectively. The roughness of HfO2-PVP films is less than 0.5 nm and the refractive index is about 1.75. The results show that the laser damage threshold of HfO2 films is higher than 15 J/cm3 (1064 nm, 1 ns), while the laser damage threshold for HfO2-PVP coatings can be as high as 20 J/cm3 (1064 nm, 1 ns). The mechanism of the laser damage process of HfO2-PVP coatings was also discussed.",

SEM results show that Ni5Zn21 nanowires are deposited in most of the nanopores of the template, and they are continuous and dense throughout the whole length. The XRD result demonstrates that the nanowires are mainly composed of a cubic gamma phase Ni5Zn21 alloy, but there also exists a trace of Zn-rich eta phase. HRTEM and ED reveal that the alloy nanowires are polycrystalline with the crystallite size of several tens of nanometers. EPMA of a single nanowire illustrates that there exist Ni-rich microzones in as-deposited nanowires. Subsequent magnetic measurements of the array also confirmed the existence of them. In addition, it can be further inferred that the shape of Ni-rich microzones is probably barlike or disklike, from the anisotropy of zero field cooling/field cooling (ZFC/FC) curves as well as the vortex magnetization behavior of the Ni5Zn21 nanowire array. The low-temperature magnetoresistance of the Ni5Zn21 nanowire array was also measured. Giant magnetoresistance instead of anisotropic magnetoresistance is suggested to be responsible for contributing to the magnetoresistance.",

Vanadyl-triisopropoxide (VO(OC3H7)3) was used as the starting material, MWCNTs pretreated with acids by a two-step process was used as the conductive ingredient.\n V2O5–MWCNTs composites were synthesized via a sol–gel method with solvent exchange and an ambient pressure drying technique. The\n samples were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, BET, Raman spectra and electrical resistivity measurement respectively. The experimental\n results indicate that the V2O5–MWCNTs nanocomposite has a fiber-like and tri-dimensional network structure. Its surface area is up to 189.7 m2/g when the MWCNTs’ content is 15 wt%. And MWCNTs are dispersed homogeneously in the composites. The electrical resistivity\n of the composites decreases from 1,239 to 765 Ω·cm when the MWCNTs’ content increases from 0 to 10 wt%. Thus MWCNTs can improve\n properties of V2O5 aerogels as the cathode material in lithium batteries.",

The detailed physical and chemical growth processes regarding the formation of the nanowires have been investigated using mass spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, and differential scanning calorimetry analysis, as well as structure analysis by electron microscopy. In reference to Gibbs energy calculation, our study reveals that the growth relies on the decomposition of MoO2 vapors through condensation of its vapor at high substrate temperatures. The aligned growth is a result of competing growth with the nanowires normal to the substrate surface reaching the final growth front. The field emission measurement and the vacuum luminescent tube study show that the Mo nanowires have potential application as electron emitters.",

        "abstract": "Segregation behavior is an important problem in solidification process of alloys,which determines their growth morphologies,phase distributions and concentration segregations so that it affects the mechanical properties of alloys,such as fatigue lives,creep properies,etc..However,the segregation behaviors of Ni-based superalloys are very complex that contain multi-components and consist of multi-phases.The solute partition coefficient is a key characteristic parameter to express the solute segregation level and tendency in a solidification process.In the present paper,the solute profiles in directionally solidified DZ125 alloy with planar interface growth,which was obtained through experiments of quenching during directional solidification,have been measured by electron probe micro analysis(EPMA).The steady state of solute redistribution hardly reaches due to melt flow during solidification process.The contents ofγ′phase forming elements,Al,Ti,Ta,Mo and Ni,along longitudinal direction increase with the increase of solidified fraction,while those of W,Cr and Co decrease.The results show that the solute partition coefficients of Al,Ti,Ta,Mo and Ni are less than unit,those of W,Cr and Co are more than unit.In addition,the solute distribution in solid phase with dendrite growth is similar to that with planar interface growth.Compared the experimental results of microsegregation with the calculated ones of Scheil model and Brody-Flemings model,the Brody-Flemings model fits better with the experimental results.It indicates that the back-diffusion in solid phase would reduce the microsegregation during dendrite growth.",

        "abstract": "At present, people’s learning styles become diverse, for which mobile learning is a significant trend that enables distributed learners to achieve collaborative learning and allows them to be engaged in virtual teams to work together. In this research, we develop a system to cope with the problem in current mobile learning circumstance, where learners in virtual teams generally lack proper communications, guidance and assistances between each other. Following the theory of Kolb team learning experience, we use our system, Teamwork as a Service (TaaS), to work in conjunction with cloud-based learning management systems. This system targets at organizing a series of learning activities and then forming a learning flow in order to allow learners to participate into smart collaborations. Executing the five web services of TaaS sequentially, learners can have their collaborative learning arranged in a better environment, where they are able to know about one another, be grouped into cloud-based ‘Jigsaw Classroom’, plan and publish tasks and supervise other learners mutually. In particular, one primary point of enhancing learners’ teamwork performance is to offer them computational choice of task allocation. For this reason, we model the social features related to the collaborative learning activities, and introduce a genetic algorithm (GA) approach to group learners into appropriate teams with two different team formation scenarios. The technical details of the operation principle of GA are illustrated thoroughly. Finally, experimental results are presented to prove our approach is workable to facilitate teamwork with considerations of learner’s capabilities and preferences. We also demonstrate our implementation details of the newly designed TaaS over the Amazon cloud and discuss the main improvements for collaborative learning brought by TaaS.",

        "abstract": "An effective method to prepare the composites of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) was presented. Vanadyl-triisopropoxide (VO(OC3H7)3) was used as the starting material, MWCNTs pretreated with acids by a two-step process was used as the conductive ingredient. V2O5-MWCNTs composites were synthesized via a sol-gel method with solvent exchange and an ambient pressure drying technique. The samples were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, BET, Raman spectra and electrical resistivity measurement respectively. The experimental results indicate that the V2O5-MWCNTs nanocomposite has a fiber-like and tri-dimensional network structure. Its surface area is up to 189.7 m2/g when the MWCNTs' content is 15 wt%. And MWCNTs are dispersed homogeneously in the composites. The electrical resistivity of the composites decreases from 1,239 to 765 Ω•cm when the MWCNTs' content increases from 0 to 10 wt%. Thus MWCNTs can improve properties of V2O5 aerogels as the cathode material in lithium batteries. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

This method affords high-surface-area alumina aerogel monoliths without the use of complexing agents. The structure and morphology of the aerogels were investigated by TEM, XRD, FTIR and BET techniques. The results confirmed that the as-prepared alumina aerogel possessed a network microstructure made up of pseudoboehmite fibers and a surface area of 690 m2/g. It was transformed to γ-Al 2O3 after heat treatment at 800 °C without a significant loss in surface area. DMA analysis and hotdisk thermal analysis were performed to characterize the mechanical and thermal properties of the samples. The results indicated that the alumina aerogel was robust and exhibited excellent thermal insulating properties. The elastic modulus was up to 11.4 MPa after drying, which is the one of the highest modulus of alumina aerogels ever reported. The thermal conductivities at 30 °C and 400 °C were 0.028 W/mK and 0.065 W/mK respectively. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Clinical and laboratory data on IBD and hepatitis infection were collected. A control group of 22,373 healthy individuals was also included in the study.Present and past HBV infection was found in 40.62% of IBD patients (ulcerative colitis: HBsAg+, 5.68%; anti-HBc+, 41.64%; Crohn's disease: HBsAg+, 5.29%; anti-HBc+, 39.80%;), and 27.58% of the non-IBD group (HBsAg+, 5.52%; anti-HBc+, 27.58% [P = 0.00]). HCV infection was found in 0.42% of IBD patients and 0.36% of the non-IBD group (P=0.80). One hundred and fifty-four of the IBD patients (21.57%) had been effectively vaccinated for HBV. In a multivariate analysis, age, family history of hepatitis B, and IBD-related admission were significantly related to HBV infection in IBD patients. Potential risk factors for HCV were not analyzed due to the limited number of HCV-positive patients in the study.Prevalence of HBV infection in IBD patients was higher than that in the non-IBD patients, whereas prevalence of HCV infection was similar to that of the non-IBD group. Effective vaccination for HBV was present in only a small proportion of IBD patients.",

Autoimmune liver disease (AILD) may be involved in IBD as an extra-intestinal manifestation (EIM). Epidemiologic and anatomic evidence have demonstrated an intimate crosstalk between the gut and the liver. In this review, we briefly introduced nine groups of susceptibility loci shared by inflammatory bowel and autoimmune liver disease for the first time. The genome-wide association studies (GWAS) evidence of pathways involving crosstalk between the gut and the liver is clarified and explained. It has been found that  HNF4-α ,  GPR35 ,  MST1R ,  CARD9 ,  IL2/IL21/IL2R ,  BACH2 ,  TNFRSF14 ,  MAdCAM-1 , and  FUT2  are the genes involved in tight junction formation, macrophage function, T helper cell or T reg  cell cycle and function, TNF secretion, lymphocyte homing or intestinal dysbiosis, respectively.

The fractured surface of the punch-out disks consists of three characteristic zones, namely the deformation band, the fractured zone, and the burr. Vein-like patterns, river-like patterns, and the coexistence of river-like patterns plus radiating cores are found on the fractured surface as the ratio of the punch-head/die clearance to the plate thickness, i.e., the relative clearance, increases because of the changes of the stress states during shear punching. Moreover, with the increase of the relative clearance, more plastic deformation occurs, causing the increase in the height percentages of both deformation band and burr. 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

Compared with the larger one, the smaller size glassy alloy with the same chemical composition exhibits significantly enhanced plasticity, suggesting a \"smaller is softer\" trend of metallic glasses. The phenomenon is attributed to the fact that the smaller size alloy, which experienced a faster cooling rate during solidification, contains a larger amount of heats of relaxation and crystallization, favoring the preferential nucleation of shear bands and thus allowing enhanced plasticity upon compressive loading. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.",

Methods There were 32 volunteers (17 to 66 years old) and 14 patients(18 to 71 years old) with BP diseases underwent conventional sequences imaging (T1WI,T2WI,and STIR/long TE) and DWIBS on 1.5T MR scanner with synergy-head/neck coil. Two radiologists reviewed all images and calculated the numbers of visualized parts of BP in 32 volunteers′ 64 laterals by consensus; described the characteristics of BP diseases. Results The numbers of visualized spinal root,ganglion,supra clavicular and infra clavicular of BP were 37,28,52,and 44 on STIR/long TE sequence,and 60,57,56,and 50 on DWIBS,respectively. The percentage of visualized spinal root and ganglion of BP on DWIBS were higher than those of STIR/long TE sequence (P< 0.05). There were 4 cases of traumatic BP injuries,which showed spine root and ganglion defeat,spinal root spurious meningocele,traumatic meningocele and the musculature changes; 7 cases of metastasis,which showed BP shifted,thickened and swelled because of the tumor invasion; 3 case of inflammation caused BP swelling. The configuration of superior and infra BP could be showed with high signal clearly by DWIBS. Conclusion Our study suggested that DWIBS was as reliable as conventional sequence in BP imaging and appeared more valuable for locating the involved pathological range.",

It relied on the accelerating prenucleated clusters around proteins, through the form of metallothioneins-like self-assembly. We demonstrated that the encapsulated proteins/enzymes could well maintain their native conformations, and the tightness of structural confinement within porous MOFs endowed the enzymes with excellent bioactivity even in harsh conditions (e.g. proteolytic agent, high temperature and chemical agents). Furthermore, owing to the merits of nondestructive and protein surface charge-independent encapsulation, the feasibility of this biomimetic strategy for biostorage, enzymes cascades and biosensing was also verified. It is believed that this convenient and versatile encapsulation strategy has great promise in the important field of biomedicine, catalysis and sensing.",

Graphene nanosheets (GNS) as soft anti-shrinkage additive, well incorporated into carbon aerogels (CAs) matrix, significantly reinforce the nanostructural skeleton of CAs and effectively inhibit collapse of nanopores and linear shrinkage during carbonization. By further optimization of loading GO content, the resultant GNS/CAs exhibited high surface areas (as high as 3214 m 2  g −1 ) and a low appearance density of 23.5 mg cm −3  at the same time, which are the highest surface areas for GNC/CAs ever reported. In addition, the resultant composite CAs exhibited high deformation capacitor (∼20.5%), excellent electrical conductivity (2.25 Ω −1  cm −1  at a density of 23.5 mg cm −3 ), and extremely low thermal conductivity of 0.027 W m −1  K −1 , comparable with that of the pristine CAs.

        "abstract": "Declining groundwater levels caused by over-exploitation in the middle reaches of the Heihe River basin have raised concerns with respect to the sustainability of the aquifer system. The groundwater depletion in the Daman irrigation district is particularly serious suffering ~20 m drawdown of groundwater level since 1980s. In this paper, a transient groundwater flow model was constructed and calibrated to simulate the groundwater dynamics in Daman irrigation district. A groundwater management tool has been developed to prevent further drawdown of groundwater level in conjunction with the flow model for this area. The response matrix method is used to transform a groundwater management problem into an optimization function. As a highly efficient and reliable method, the simplex method is used to solve the optimization problem. In the case of Daman irrigation district, the optimization problem is to maximize the pumping yields subject to the groundwater level constraints. To verify the effectiveness of the groundwater management tool, three different groundwater level constraints are assigned for the system control. The results indicate that the groundwater management tool is capable of identifying the optimal pumping yields for satisfying the given constraints. Further, the cultivated area which could be sustained by the optimized yearly pumping yields is calculated under the assumption of normal account of diverted water from the Heihe River. The results suggest two plausible solutions to approach the sustainable pumping yield. Although this study focus on the Heihe River Basin, it illustrates a general modeling framework for the sustainability of groundwater flow systems.",

Heavy benzene fetched from the bottom of a crude benzene distillation column was separated by distillation, and the fractions with a boiling point range of 160-185 °C were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. A Ni-Mo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was prepared for hydrogenating the model compounds, including styrene and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB), which was found in the fraction of heavy benzene. Catalytic activity was evaluated in a 17 mL autoclave at 80-200 °C, 3.0-7.0 MPa cold hydrogen pressures, and 8-30 min reaction time. The results indicated that TMB was almost not reactive in such conditions; however, the styrene conversion and corresponding selectivity of ethyl benzene increased with the increase of the reaction temperature, reaction time, H2 pressure, and catalyst dosage. The optimum conditions for maximum styrene conversion were 150 °C, 15 min, 5 MPa cold H2 pressure, and 2 wt % (of reactant) catalyst dosage. The results can offer some ideas for the hydrogenation process to improve the quality of heavy benzene. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "The influences of melt flow generated by traveling magnetic fields (TMFs) on dendrite growth during the upward-directional solidification of Pb–33 wt% Sn binary alloy were investigated under the condition of 1× g gravity. When the direction of the TMF was changed from upward to downward, the primary dendrite spacing gradually increased, and the peak of distribution of the primary dendrite spacing shifted to the narrower values. This was caused by the different intensities of melt flow, which was controlled by TMFs. The effects of TMFs on melt flow were similar to those of adjustments in gravity levels; thus, the primary dendrite spacing varied. The effective gravity acceleration, which was used to modulate melt flow, decreased for downward-TMFs and increased for upward-TMFs. As the drawing speed increased, the modulated flow showed more significant influences on primary dendrites spacing.",

        "abstract": "Implantation of embryonic stem cells (ESC)-derived insulin-producing cells has been extensively investigated for treatment of diabetes in animal models. However, the in vivo behavior and migration of transplanted cells in diabetic models remains unclear. Here we investigated the location and migration of insulin-producing cells labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) using a dynamic MRI tracking method. SPIO labeled cells showed hypointense signal under the kidney subcapsules of diabetic mice on MRI, and faded gradually over the visiting time. However, new hypointense signal appeared in the spleen 1 week after transplantation, and became obvious with the time prolongation. Further histological examination proved the immigrated cells were insulin and C-peptide positive cells which were evenly distributed throughout the spleen. These intra-spleen insulin-producing cells maintained their protective effects against hyperglycemia in vivo, and these effects were reversed upon spleen removal. Transplantation of insulin-producing cells through spleen acquired an earlier blood glucose control as compared with that through kidney subcapsules. In summary, our data demonstrate that insulin-producing cells transplanted through kidney subcapsules were not located in situ but migrated into spleen, and rescues hyperglycemia in diabetic models. MRI may provide a novel tracking method for preclinical cell transplantation therapy of diabetes continuously and non-invasively.",

        "abstract": "SiO2 aerogels were prepared via sol-gel process and dried at ambient pressure. Surface modification was employed to adjust the nanoporous structure and to increase the surface area in the aerogels. The hydrophobic Si-CH3 groups of trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) replaced the hydrophilic-OH groups on the surface of aerogels. The infrared spectrum (IR) revealed differences between groups on the surface as a result of the surface modification. The contact angle between the silica aerogels and water was 130°, indicating excellent hydrophilic property of the silica aerogels. A novel application of SiO2 aerogels is in the area of adsorption with super surface area and high porosities. The experiments suggested that the adsorption capacity of silica aerogels for methylbenzene, carbon tetrachloride, and acetaldehyde was 3-4 times of that of activated carbon fiber (ACF) or granule of activated carbon (GAC).",

Although it has been found that TRAF4 and TRAF6 share the same TRAF binding sites, comprehensive study of TRAF4 and TRAF6 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is still lacking. This paper shows similar and different expression patterns of TRAF4 and TRAF6 in patients with IBD. The results indicate that TRAF4 and TRAF6 are overexpressed in IBD. TRAF4 and TRAF6 play different roles in the pathogenesis of IBD. Moreover, TRAF4 may be an indicator of endoscopic disease activity of UC and TRAF6 preactivation can be detected in noninflamed colonic segments.",

        "abstract": "Background and Aim: We aimed to assess the correlation between computed tomography enterography (CTE) and balloon-assisted enteroscopy on severity of small bowel lesions, and evaluated the accuracy of CTE parameters in assessing small intestine lesions in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Methods: We performed an observational study of a single-center cohort. Data were retrieved from our inpatient databases starting from October 2007. Correlations between computed tomography parameters (bowel wall thickness, mural enhancement, comb sign, extramural findings, and stricture), endoscopic and histological severity scores, CD Activity Index [CDAI], and C-reactive protein were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation. Results: Seventy patients were included in this study. One hundred fifty-seven segments were examined. Bowel wall thickness (r=0.6334, P<0.0001), mural enhancement (r=0.5477, P<0.0001), comb sign (r=0.5898, P<0.0001), and extramural findings (r=0.4754, P<0.0001) were moderately correlated with the segmental Capsule Endoscopy CDAI. The segmental CTE score also moderately correlated with the segmental Capsule Endoscopy CDAI (r=0.6714, P<0.0001), while the total CTE score strongly correlated with the total Capsule Endoscopy CDAI (r=0.7252, P<0.0001). Both total CTE score (r=0.5937, P<0.0001) and total Capsule Endoscopy CDAI (r=0.6364, P<0.0001) correlated significantly with the Harvey-Bradshaw Index. Of five computed tomography parameters, bowel wall thickness have the best accuracy to detect small intestine lesions with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.811 (P<0.0001), with a sensitivity and specificity of 81.82% and 74.14%, respectively. Conclusion: CTE is a reliable technique for detecting small intestine lesions in patients with CD, also provides accurate information on small bowel CD severity and activity, with close agreement to inflammatory markers, CDAI, and histopathology. © 2013 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",

The films prepared under different N2/CH4 flow ratios were studied by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction and secondary ion mass spectroscopy. Their field emission characteristics, i.e. both the distribution of the emission sites and current-voltage characteristics, were recorded using a transparent anode technique. It was found that the grain size of films prepared under different conditions varies and has a relationship with their turn-on fields. A possible explanation is given, which proposes that nanocrystalline boundary induced defect states might affect the field emission characteristics.",

        "abstract": "High temperature tensile properties and microstructure morphologies of directionally solidified NiAl-Cr(Mo) alloy under different compositions and withdrawal rates were investigated. Tensile strength of 513.8 MPa was obtained in the directionally solidified NiAl-36Cr-6Mo hypereutectic alloy at 1000 °C, which is the highest value reported in the NiAl-Cr(Mo) alloy until now. In addition, perfect cellular eutectic alloy solidified at fast withdrawal rate possessed higher tensile strength and elongation than planar eutectic alloy solidified at low withdrawal rate when they had the same composition. This is because bonding strength between eutectic cells in the perfect cellular eutectic alloy was high, which resulted in high crack propagation resistance and harmonious deformations in the intracellular and intercellular regions. The results above may change the locked-in view that only regular eutectic microstructure morphology grown with planar solid/liquid interface could be used in the eutectic in-situ composites. Perfect cellular microstructure morphology grown in a far fast rate could be also used, which would result in high efficiency in the industrial production. Refined microstructure, larger volume fraction of strengthening phase and dispersion strengthening of second phase particles were contribute to the improvement of high temperature tensile strength of the directionally solidified NiAl-Cr(Mo) alloy. However, the bonding strength of interface was obviously different in the alloys with different microstructure morphologies, which had significant effect on the tensile strength. When bonding strength of phase interface was low, the other strengthening factors could not be able to play their due roles, thus leading to relatively low tensile strength.",

Both HoCuAl and ErCuAl just undergo a second-order ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition at T C. Large reversible magnetic entropy changes (ΔS M) are observed around their respective Curie temperatures due to the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition. For a field change of 0-5 T, the peak values of -ΔS M of RCuAl (R=Ho and Er) compounds are 23.9 and 22.9 J kg -1 K -1 at T C, with the values of refrigerant capacity of 393 and 321 J kg -1, respectively. These properties suggest that RCuAl (R=Ho and Er) compounds could be considered as attractive magnetic refrigerants working in low temperature range. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

The porosity of the aerogel films is 56%, 16% higher than that of the xerogel films when dried at 120℃. The aerogel films have the higher capacity, 530mAh/g,as well as better reversibility than those of the xerogel films. The improvement of the capacity can be ascribed to the increase of porosity as well as the pore diameters after the solvent exchange.",

Methods: One side of sciatic nerve of all 20 New Zealand rabbits were randomly selected to be tracted by smooth forceps to produce the traction injury. The sciatic nerve of the other side of each rabbit was exposed surgically, but not tracted, and defined as the sham-operated group. MRI examination of bilateral sciatic nerves was performed before surgery and at 3 days after traction injury. The MRI examinations consisted of 3D T2-weighted imaging, T1-weighted imaging, 3D T2-weighted imaging with SPIR, mixed multiple echo (T1 calculation) and SE multiple echo (T2 calculation) sequences. After MRI examination the nerves were sampled for pathological examination. And the function of hind limbs of each rabbit was record. Results: After sciatic nerve traction injury, the motor and reflex function of injured hind limb were abnormal. On MR imaging, the injured sciatic nerve showing high signal intensity on 3D T2WI and T2VVI/SPIR, and myelin disaggregation and axon loss histologically. The T1 and 12 relaxation time of proximal segment, traded segment and distal segment of sciatic nerve after injury were higher than that before injury. Conclusion: The injured nerve is characterized as thickened in size and increased T1 and T2 relaxation time. By correlation of MR imaging with pathology, the acute sciatic nerve traction injury animal mode is successfully produced in rabbits.",

        "abstract": "Oxygen content is more than any other elements in coal,whose content and existing forms have a great effect on the characteristics of coal,especially on that of low rank coal.The oxygen in low rank coal is mainly represented by phenolic hydroxy1 and ether bond,also carbony1,carboxy1,furan and the like.Sum up and compare two kinds of determination methods of oxygen functional groups.The results show that physical determination method is convenient and efficient,however,its practical applicability is poor,for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS)and infrared radiation(IR) fail to distinguish some peaks.The operation of chemical determination method is complex and time-consuming along with inaccurate results.Analyze the influence of those oxygen functional groups on coal direct liquefaction.It's found that phenolic hydroxy1 interferes the liquefaction for its cross-linking reaction,liquefying ability of high ether is much more active,liquefying mechanism of carboxy1 is complicated.The study of oxygen functional groups helps to improve coal liquefaction level,also enriches coal science and technology theory.",

Firstly, the plates were carefully characterised magnetically and thermally. The plates were prepared with 5 wt% resin, and from density measurements it was found that the volume ratio of the magnetocaloric material in the plates was 0.53, due to the resin and porosity. The best operating conditions for the plate regenerator were determined at which a temperature span of 6.4 K was measured along the plates.",

        "abstract": "W18O49 nanowires have been intensively studied in recent years due to their good field emission (FE) performances. However, now their development has encountered difficulties, i.e., their emission uniformity is not good enough for high resolution field emission display (FED) applications. Here, we have successfully fabricated patterned, large-scale W18O49 nanowire vertical-arrays and for the first time applied an in situ plasma treatment technique to improve their field emission performance. It is found that their emission uniformity has been improved to a very high level (distribution uniformity of emission sites is higher than 96% and their brightness uniformity reaches 75.64%), while other emission properties remained unchanged compared to untreated nanowires. The bombardment of Ar plasma and the reduction of H2 plasma may be responsible for the improvement of their FE performance. It can be concluded that this developed technique is a very effective route to enhance the emission uniformity of patterned W18O49 nanowire arrays, which may pave the way for FE emission behavior improvement of other metal oxide nanowires. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.",

Test results indicate that, the collisions between ten million particles and the vessel can be detected on a general personal computer in only 0.5 s per frame.

The increase of hot-pressing temperature and time made the amount of VOCs enhanced and the initial emission concentration and emission rate increased. With the augment of hot-pressing temperature and time, the aromatic compounds of VOCs increased, the variety of the terpene declined and the species and relative content of ester compounds were rarely changed.",

In this study, experiments based on the forward voltage method were set up to measure the transient temperature behavior of chips after the removal of heating load. A hybrid experimental/numerical method was developed to calculate multiple unknown interface thermal resistances and improve the prediction of the temperature distribution of high-power laser diode arrays by analyzing the transient temperature behavior of chips. The largest deviation between numerical and experimental results is 1.3 K. Based on the numerical results, thermal resistances for different layers and temperature distribution inside the chip were obtained and evaluated. Some suggestions for improving the thermal design of high-power laser diode arrays were derived.",

Compared with its as-cast counterpart, the annealed alloys deform from ductile to brittle evident both in the morphology of fracture surface and the data of fracture stress and strain. From the point of view of classical fracture mechanics, the annealing induced embrittlement is considered to be due to the loss of plastic deformation ability in the crack tip zone resulting from the decrease of free volumes in the annealing process. The presence of nano-scale precipitates embedded in the amorphous matrix is found to increase the viscosity of the system and undermine the mechanical properties of the annealed alloys. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

        "title": "Effects of pulling rate on microstructure evolution of directionally solidified Fe-4.2Ni alloy in diffusion regime",
        "abstract": "Phase selection and microstructure evolution play important roles on processing and property control of the materials with peritectic reactions. Many interesting microstructures, such as peritectic coupled growth (PCG), discrete banding, island banding (IB) and oscillatory tree-like structure were observed in directionally solidified peritectic alloys. In recent years, a number of theoretical models have been developed for the phase selection. For example, it was believed that peritectic coupled growth is initiated by island banding and is similar to eutectic coupled growth, discrete banding is shaped by nucleation and lateral spreading of one phase onto the other phase, and island banding is formed when the nucleation rate of one phase on the other phase growth interface is higher than a critical value, and etc.. But these models were developed under the assumption that the growth of the phases are controlled by diffusion only, whereas the actual experimental studies were mainly carried out in bulk metallic samples with the presence of convection. Although it has been believed that the convection effects on microstructure evolution are very important and could not be neglected, studies were seldom carried out in diffusive regime. In this paper, directional solidification of Fe-4.2Ni hypo-peritectic alloy in diffusive regime was carried out in a Bridgman furnace by placing the samples in 1 mm inner diameter thin tubes. The experimental results show that various microstructures and phase selections are obtained in the directionally solidified thin samples at the pulling rates of 15 and 35 μm/s. Tree-like structure, peritectic coupled growth and the steadily solidified structure of two phases separated growth are formed at the pulling rate of 15 μm/s, and the microstructures evolution is: single phase δ→tree-like structure→γ and PCG→separately growing δ/γ. At the pulling rate of 35 μm/s, the main microstructure is γ-IB, and the microstructures evolution is: δ→ tree-like structure→γ-IB in the center and PCG at the edge→δ in the center and γ-IB at the edge. As the pulling rate increases from 15 to 35 μm/s, the morphology of tree-like structure formed by the competitive growth between the nucleated γ-phase and the parent δ-phase becomes complicated. It is found that the pulling rate plays an important role in both the formation and evolution of various microstructures. ©.",

Monolithic iron oxide aerogels were with uniform size and low density, porous materials consisted of nearly spherical, nanometer ultramicrous α-Fe2O3 with diameters about 60 nm. By adjusting molar ratio of sodium hydroxide and ferric chloride(OH-/Fe3+), the pore structure and specific surface area of the aerogel samples can be controlled.",

        "abstract": "Background: Many studies indicated that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway regulated cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, apoptosis and angiogenesis. The recent successful development of monoclonal antibodies targeting EGFR (EGFR-mAb) has expanded the treatment options for colorectal cancer (CRC). Aims: To systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of EGFR-mAb when added to therapeutic regimens in the treatment of CRC. Methods: Eligible articles relevant to the topic were identified by searching the frequently used database. All randomized controlled trials comparing the arm with EGFR-mAb to the arm without EGFR-mAb during the treatment of CRC were included. Summary odds ratio (OR) of response rate and incidence of adverse events were analyzed. Subgroup-analysis and sensitivity analysis were also performed. The publication bias was tested by funnel plot. Results: Seven randomized controlled trials (n=4186) were identified. Pooled response rate to therapeutic regimen in patients with and without EGFR-mAb (treated group and control group) by intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was 25.4% and 17.6%, respectively (OR 3.36, 95% CI: 1.42-7.95), and by per protocol (PP) analysis was 25.6% and 18.0%, respectively (OR 3.32, 95% CI: 1.40-7.88). Response rate of treated group was superior to that of the control group. Pooled incidence of grade 3-4 adverse events of the treated group by ITT analysis was higher than that of the control group (71.2% vs. 54.3%, OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.74-2.86), so did the occurrence rates of skin lesions, diarrhea, and hypomagnesemia. Conclusions: EGFR-mAb increases significantly the response rate to therapeutic regimen in patients with CRC, especially the metastatic/advanced CRC, associated with a moderate increase of grade 3-4 adverse events.",

The temperature gradient distribution and the solid/liquid (S/L) interface shape evolution were investigated during directional solidification (DS). Numerical results were compared with experimental results and good agreement was found. The experimental results demonstrate that solidification defects, such as freckles and stray grains, were observed on the platform of the blades. Numerical results indicate that this phenomenon should be attributed to a lower axial temperature gradient and a concave S/L interface shape. In order to overcome the shortcomings, two types of non-uniform thickness mould are designed to obtain higher temperature gradient ahead of S/L interface and flat S/L interface, contributing to reducing or eliminating the solidification defects in the blades during direction solidification.",

Growing evidence shows that lncRNAs present important function in development and are associated with many human diseases such as cancers, Alzheimer disease, and heart diseases. Transcribed ultraconserved region (T-UCR) transcripts are a novel class of lncRNAs transcribed from ultraconserved regions (UCRs). UCRs are absolutely conserved (100%) between the orthologous regions of the human, rat, and mouse genomes. The UCRs are frequently located at fragile sites and at genomic regions involved in cancers. Recent data suggest that T-UCRs are altered at the transcriptional level in human tumorigenesis and the aberrant T-UCRs expression profiles can be used to differentiate human cancer types. The profound understanding of T-UCRs can throw new light on the pathogenesis of human cancers.",

The critical cooling rate for glass formation of the studied metallic glass is determined to be as low as 3.2 K/s, revealing a high glass-forming ability. The activation energies of the alloy are strongly dependent on the cooling rate during rapid solidification. Compared with the ribbon sample, the bulk sample that experiences slower cooling rate during solidification contains a greater degree of medium range orders (MRO), which favors nucleation, therefore leading to its smaller activation energies.",

The nonlinear dynamics of pipeline system is composed by two gravity-flow tanks, and are described by Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model. The controller design is based on overall stability, and is carried out via the parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme. To obtain better output dynamic performance, a given bounds is introduced to the output of nonlinear systems. Moreover, by means of linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique, it is shown that the existence of such constrained control system can be transformed into the feasibility of a convex optimization problem. Finally, by applying the designed controller, the simulation results demonstrate the efficiency.",

TRAF3 and TRAF5 are overexpressed in the colon of rat/mouse models with colitis. However, the expressions of TRAF3 and TRAF5 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease have not been elucidated. The aim of the present study is to explore the potential roles of TRAF3 and TRAF5 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.Plasma levels of TRAF3 and TRAF5 proteins were detected by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Colonic expression of TRAF3 and TRAF5 proteins was detected by western blot analysis. Quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was applied for gene expression. Inflamed intestinal mucosa and non-inflamed intestinal mucosa in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and normal mucosa was analyzed from healthy controls.The plasma levels of TRAF3 and TRAF5 were significantly higher both in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis than in healthy controls. Only soluble TRAF5 showed a weak correlation with endoscopic disease activity index (Baron score) in patients with ulcerative colitis (spearman's r=0.358, P=0.022). Gene expressions of TRAF3 and TRAF5 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were significantly higher both in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis than in healthy controls (all P<0.0001). Gene and protein expressions of TRAF3 and TRAF5 were significantly higher in inflamed colonic mucosa of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis than in non-inflamed colonic mucosa and normal mucosa of healthy controls (all P<0.0001). Furthermore, gene and protein expressions of TRAF3 and TRAF5 were also significantly higher in non-inflamed colonic mucosa of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis than in normal mucosa of healthy controls.TRAF3 and TRAF5 are overexpressed in inflammatory bowel disease. Although the endoscopic appearance can be normal, TRAF3 and TRAF5 pre-activation can be detected in non-inflamed colonic segments.",

The relative dense layer with a porosity of ∼10% was obtained from an as-prepared sol, while the porous layer with a porosity of ∼55% was from a modified one with block copolymer (BCP) Pluronic F127 as template which results in abundant ordered mesopores. The two layers give rise to a reasonable refractive index gradient from air to the substrate and thus high transmittance in a wide wavelength range, and both of them have the same tough skeleton despite different porosity, for which each single-layer and the double-layer coatings all behaved well in the mechanical property tests. The high transmittance and the strong ability of resisting abrasion make this coating promising for applications in some harsh conditions. In addition, the preparation is simple, low-cost, time-saving, and flexible for realizing the optical property.",

The morphology and microstructure of the silica aerogels were investigated by using specific surface area, SBET, SEM, TEM and the pore size distribution techniques. The thermal conductivity was also measured as a function of air pressure. The results show that the diameter of the silica particles is about 13 nm and the pore size of the silica aerogels is 20–80 nm.

        "abstract": "Abstract   This study presents flow boiling heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics of R1234ze(E) in a smooth horizontal tube with an inner diameter of 6 mm. The experiments were conducted at saturation pressures from 0.215 to 0.415 MPa, mass fluxes from 130 to 258 kg m −2  s −1  and heat fluxes from 10.6 to 74.8 kW m −2 . The influences of saturation pressure, mass flux and heat flux were analyzed. Furthermore, the performance of R1234ze(E) was compared with R600a. The results show that heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop of R600a are larger than R1234ze(E). Several well-known correlations were evaluated and the results indicate that the correlation of Fang (2013) and Yang et al. (2017) give the best fit to the heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop respectively. Finally, a new heat transfer correlation was proposed and it makes great progress in the prediction accuracy.",

The as-prepared powders were analyzed and characterized by chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). The results show that the high energy ball milling with variable rotation rate and repeated circulation could be used to produce nanocrystalline WC-Co powder composites with high efficiency. The compositions of the powders meet the specifications with low impurity content. The mean grain size decreases, and the lattice distortion and the system energy increase with the increase of the milling time. The morphology of nanocrystalline WC-Co particles displays dominantly sphere shape and their particle sizes are all lower than 80 nm. The eutectic temperature of the nanocrystalline WC-10Co-0.8VC-0.2 Cr 3C 2 composites is about 1280°C.",

The directional solidification microstructure and the field emission properties of the Si-TaSi2 eutectic in situ composite prepared by two kinds of crystal growth techniques have been systematically tested and compared. Researches demonstrated\n that the solidification microstructure of EBFZM can be fined obviously because of the relatively high solidification rate\n and very high temperature gradient, i.e. both the diameter and inter-rod spacing of the TaSi2 fibers prepared by EBFZM technique were decreased, and the density and the volume fraction of the TaSi2 fibers prepared by EBFZM technique were increased in comparison with that of the TaSi2 fibers prepared by CZ method. Therefore the field emission property of the Si-TaSi2 eutectic in situ composite prepared by EBFZM can be improved greatly, which exhibits better field emission uniformity and straighter F-N curve.",

The analyses showed that the V10O24·12H2O have a nano-structure with porous, and the diameter about 40-60 nm. The infrared absorption properties were discussed based on the vibration model and the change of bond length before and after reaction. It has reveal that shift of the absorption peaks of the V10O24·12H2O was caused by the lattice expansion and formation of low valence vanadium ion in V10O24·12H2O.

METHODS: The gene encoding HBV targeted ribonuclease was cloned into prokaryotic expression vector pTAT-HA. Recombinant plasmid was transduced into E.coli BL21 (DE3) LysS, and then induced with IPTG. The expression of the fusion protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Tat-TR fusion protein was purified and added to the HepG2 cell culture. The transduction efficiency was evaluated by IFA. MTT assay was performed to investigate the cytotoxicity of Tat-TR. Tat-TR was added into the cultured HepG2.2.15 cells, and the HBV DNA concentration was measured using quantitative PCR. Immunohistochemical staining was per- formed to identify whether TatPTD could introduce TR into the hepatocytes in vivo.",

        "abstract": "To determine the capacity of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in differential diagnosis between recurrent carcinoma and postchemoradiation fibrosis of skull base in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).Eleven patients with recurrent NPC and 21 patients with postchemoradiation fibrosis in the skull base were enrolled. All the diagnoses were proved by endoscopic biopsy or imaging follow-up. IVIM MRI was performed to obtain quantitative parameters including D (pure diffusion), f (perfusion fraction), and D* (pseudodiffusion). D, f, and D* were compared between two groups; the diagnostic performances of D and f were evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.D and f values were significantly lower in recurrent carcinoma than that in fibrosis (P < 0.001; P = 0.001). No significant difference was found in D* values between recurrent carcinoma and fibrosis (P = 0.229). ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the curve of D and f values were 0.996 and 0.838, respectively. Respective cutoff values with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were: D = 1.161 × 10(-3) mm(2) /s (sensitivity 100.0%, specificity 95.2%, accuracy 96.9%), f = 0.109 (sensitivity 81.8%, specificity 71.4%, accuracy 75.0%).Recurrent NPC and postchemoradiation fibrosis in the skull base have distinctive D and f values. IVIM MRI could be used to differentiate between recurrent carcinoma and postchemoradiation fibrosis in patients with NPC. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2016.",

With slight Sr-doping, the ferromagnetic (FM) coupling significantly increased and FM exchange is dominant in the delicate balance. A giant reversible magnetocaloric effect (MCE) and large refrigerant capacity (RC) for Eu 1−x Sr x TiO 3  compounds were observed. The values of −Δ S   M    max   are evaluated to be around 10 J/kg K under a magnetic field change of 1 T and 21 J/kg K under a magnetic field change of 2 T, respectively. But, the values of RC are increased with the more Eu in EuTiO 3  to be substituted by Sr. Therefore, the giant reversible MCE and large RC make the Eu 1−x Sr x TiO 3  compound a good candidate for magnetic refrigerant working at low-temperature and low-field.",

In this paper, we design a Web based system to implement on-line simulation system for ordinary users. As a useful example, the simulation of one type of collision detection model is presented in this paper. Moreover, the software application of simulation is offered as a service on Web. Meanwhile, the incorporation of general vector machine (GVM, a type of neural network) to intelligently predict the relationship between simulation parameters and computation resources is presented, which could further provide more information for system monitoring and scheduling. The system has demonstrated efficiency and intuitiveness for users of this type of applications. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The bending temperature exerts a crucial role on the deformation behaviors of the BMG studied. With increasing the bending temperature, the BMGs exhibit a brittle-ductile-brittle transition. For the bending temperatures of 350 and 360 °C (within the supercooled liquid region), the BMG samples deform homogeneously and have excellent deformation capacity. Furthermore, the nanocrystallization caused by the high temperature and the deformation stress was also observed after bending tests. The fracture morphology of the deformed samples changes from the vein-like pattern to the river and cleavage-like patterns as the temperature increases. The bending deformation behaviors of this BMG material have been discussed based on the structural evolution during tests. © 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "An Fe41Co7Cr15Mo14C 15B6Y2 bulk metallic glass with a diameter of 5 mm was prepared with the copper-mold-casting method. The corrosion resistance of this amorphous steel in sulfuric-acid solutions was determined by electrochemical measurements. The passive film formed on the surface of the alloy after immersion in the 0.5-mol/l H2SO4 solution for 1 week was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Electrochemical measurements show that the corrosion resistance of the amorphous steel in the 1 mol/l-H2SO4 solution is superior to a stainless steel (SUS 321), and is almost the same as Ti6Al4V, which shows that the amorphous steel has an excellent corrosion resistance in sulfuric-acid solutions. As the concentration of the sulfuric-acid solutions increases from 0.5 mol/l to 4 mol/l, the corrosion resistance of the amorphous steel decreases. The XPS result reveals that a bilayer structure of protective film formed on the surface of the amorphous steel in a H2SO4 solution. The compositions of the inner part of the film are MoO2, Cr2O3, CoO, and FeO, and those of the outer film are MoO3, Cr(OH) 3, Co(OH)2, and Fe(OH)3. © 2010 The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.",

The experimental results demonstrate that freckles were only observed at the bottom of larger cross-section. Numerical results indicate that this phenomenon should be attributed to the different convection patterns at front of solidification interface. As the withdrawal rate increased, the primary dendrites spacing has an obvious influence on freckle formation. A more in-depth investigation of the convection patterns can provide a better understanding of freckle formation and perhaps offer methods to minimize freckles in turbine blades.",

The average Total Volatile Organic Compounds( TVOC) and formaldehyde concentrations of surface finishing particleboards were measured in an airtight environmental chamber. Then the variations in kinds and contents of Volatile Organic Compounds ( VOCs) were analyzed between veneer finished and unfinished boards. The experiment results showed that formaldehyde and TVOC concentrations were different for different surface finishing treatments. Among these finishes and coatings,the barrier to the TVOC and formaldehyde of polyethylene film paper particleboard was the best,which reduced 84.18% of TVOC and 71.43% of formaldehyde. While the TVOC concentrations of the water-based coatings containing high volatile organic compounds were higher than those of the unfinished particleboards. Twenty-one kinds of VOCs were identified from the unfinished particleboards and 15 kinds of VOCs from the veneer-overlaid particleboard by the method of GC-MS,and the content of VOCs from the veneer-overlaid particleboard was over 50% lower than that of VOCs from the unfinished boards.",

Together with earthquake relocation, these identified blind faults are used in the paper to interpret the seismogenic structures of the 1997 AD Jiashi strong earthquake swarm and 2003 AD Bachu-Jiashi earthquake. The 1997 AD Jiashi strong earthquakes were generated mainly by a NW-striking buried transform-like strike-slip fault, while the 2003 AD Bachu-jiashi earthquake by blind thrusts in front of the Kalpintag nappe.",

The maximum magnetic entropy change ( |ΔS   m   | ) of Er 32 Tm 24 Co 24 Al 20  can reach 17.0 J/kgK under a field change of 5 T. Negative magnetoresistance below the magnetic ordering temperature is observed in the samples, which has  H   2   dependence due to the suppression of spin-disorder scattering. Strikingly, it is found that magnetic entropy changes ( -ΔS   m  ) and magnetoresistance (MR) have a power law relationship around and below the magnetic ordering temperature: MR   ∝    |–ΔS   m   |   c  . Thus, the MR can be a probe to explore the field-induced change of magnetic entropy in these MGs.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the value of MRI in the evaluation of liver iron storage by correlation with histopathology. Methods: Abdominal MR image and liver biopsy were performed in 35 patients with β-thalassaemia major. The signal intensity ratios of liver and spleen to the paraspinous muscles (L/M-SIR, S/M-SIR, respectively) were measured on TSE T2WI. The correlation between L/ M-SIR, S/M-SIR, serum ferritin and the percentage of hemosiderotic cells in liver determined by biopsy were analyzed. Results: L/M-SIR, S/M-SIR, serum ferritin and the percentage of hemosiderotic cells in liver of 35 cases of β-thalassaemia major were (0.53±0.24), (2.47±1.71), (2912.77±1646.01) μg/L and (61.57%± 18.26%, median 60.00%) respectively. L/M-SIR was negatively correlated with serum ferritin and the percentage of hemosiderotic cells (r=-0.38, P=0.02 and r=-0.44, P=0.01, respectively). A negative correlation was found between S/M-SIR and serum ferritin (r=-0.41, P=0.03), but there was no correlation between the percentage of hemosiderotic cells and S/M-SIR and serum ferritin. Conclusion: Measurement of signal intensity ratio of liver on MR imaging can be used as a complementary and non-invasive approach to dynamically assess liver iron overload in β-thalassaemia major.",

The results showed that the composite exhibits a compressive strength of 1980 MPa which is similar to that of the matrix, and a plastic strain of 11.5% which is 5 times of that of the matrix under quasistatic compressive deformation. Under dynamic compressive load, the compressive strength of the composite is promoted to 2648 MPa, the plastic strain is in a range from 1.8% to 7.5% and the strain rate sensitivity of the composite is 0.022. Under quasistatic condition, the compressive strength is influenced by residual thermal stress and the critical stress of the tungsten wires. Under dynamic compressive condition, besides the residual thermal stress, the main factors are the shear fracture of tungsten wires and the sinusoidal buckling of the composite.",

In this study ZrO2 thin films are prepared by sol-gel spin-coating technology from suitable zirconia aqueous colloidal suspensions containing nano-crystalline ZrO2 at room temperature synthesized by a hydrothermal process from an inorganic precursor (ZrOCl2·8H2O). By adding a soluble organic binder PVP to the suspension prior to application, it is possible to substantially increase the coating refractive index and the abrasion-resistance as well as the laser damage threshold. The features of the coatings and the colloidal suspensions are investigated. Multilayer highly reflective dielectric coatings are also elaborated by applying quarterwave-thick alternating coatings of the binder-aided zirconia and silica, which is prepared with the sol-gel process from TEOS. To achieve 99% reflectivity, 19–21 layers are required. Single shot laser damage tests are carried out using a high power laser at 1064 nm wavelength with a pulse duration of 2.5 ns. The laser damage thresholds of 18 and 15 J/cm2 are achieved for single ZrO2-PVP coating and ZrO2-PVP/SiO2 multilayers respectively.",

        "abstract": "Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have different functions in cells. They work as signals, decoys, guides, and scaffolds. Altered lncRNA levels can affect the expression of gene products. There are seldom studies on the role of lncRNAs in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Results: Quantitative RT-PCR showed that DQ786243 was significantly overexpressed in clinical active CD patients compared with clinical inactive CD patients (P = 0.0118) or healthy controls (P = 0.002). CREB was also more highly expressed in active CD than in inactive CD (P = 0.0034) or controls (P = 0.0241). Foxp3 was interestingly lower in inactive CD than in active CD (P = 0.0317) or controls (P = 0.0103), but there were no apparent differences between active CD and controls. CRP was well correlated with DQ786243 (r = 0.489, P = 0.034), CREB (r = 0.500, P = 0.029) and Foxp3 (r = 0.546, P = 0.016). At 48 hours after DQ786243 transfection, qRT-PCR showed both CREB (P = 0.017) and Foxp3 (P = 0.046) had an increased mRNA expression in Jurkat cells. Western blot showed the same pattern. After DQ786243 transfection, CREB phosphorylation ratio (p-CREB/t-CREB) was increased (P = 0.0043). Conclusion: DQ786243 can be related with severity of CD. It can affect the expression of CREB and Foxp3 through which regulates the function of Treg. CREB itself seems not the mediator of DQ786243 to up-regulate Foxp3. The phosphorylation of CREB might play a more important role in the process. © 2013 Qiao et al.",

        "abstract": "A novel titanate-zirconate solid solution with controllable nanoleaf/microsisal-like three-dimensional morphology, Na 2(Ti 0.75Zr 0.25) 4O 9, grows on the surface of a Ti-based bulk metallic glass by a combination of hydrothermal and dealloying processes. A single sisal-like bundle consists of a number of nano-sized leaves and each nanoleaf has a thickness, width and length of 20-30 nm, 200-300 nm and 15-20 μm, respectively. A modified dipole driving Ostwald ripening mechanism for the interesting architectures has been proposed based on a series of time-dependent experiments and the structure feature of titanate. Moreover, the as-synthesized nanoleaf/microsisal-like material exhibits extraordinary ability to produce hydrogen from a methanol/water solution that is higher than that of a commercial TiO 2 (Degussa P25) film, undoping titanate nanotube film and titanate-zirconate one-dimensional nanoleaf film. Possible origins of the high performance of the as-synthesized three-dimensional nanomaterials were discussed based on theoretical and experimental results. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "Open learning is a rising trend in the educational sector and it attracts millions of learners to be engaged to enjoy massive latest and free open education resources (OERs). Through the use of mobile devices, open learning is often carried out in a micro learning mode, where each unit of learning activity is commonly shorter than 15 minutes. Learners are often at a loss in the process of choosing OER leading to their long term objectives and short term demands. Our pilot work, namely MLaaS, proposed a smart system to deliver personalized OER with micro learning to satisfy their real-time needs, while its decision-making process is scarcely supported due to the lack of historical data. Inspired by this, MLaaS now embeds a new solution to tackle the cold start problem, by opening up a brand new profile for each learner and delivering them the first resources in their fresh start learning journey. In this paper, we also propose an ontology-based mechanism for learning prediction and recommendation.",

The cooling rate of a high silicon aluminum alloy powder prepared by the ultrasonic gas atomization process was calculated through the convection heat transfer principle, whose chemical composition is Al-17Si-6Fe-4.5Cu-0.5Mg. The calculation result of the cooling rate was about 10 4-10 7 K/s and indicated that a very high cooling rate could be achieved by the ultrasonic gas atomization process. Additionally the cooling rate of the alloy powder was determined by an empirical relation between the cooling rate and the dendrite spacing, It is shown that the measured results agree with the calculated results.",

The banded structure consists of two phases and the lamellar orientation within these phases is different. Lamellar boundaries within one phase inclined at an angle of 45° to the growth direction and within the other phase aligned parallel to the growth direction. A number of models were proposed to explain the band formation in TiAl alloys.

The Web service composition is achieved by solving the Web service concretization problem. The literature presents two types of Web service concretization approaches: local optimization approaches and global optimization approaches. There are three types of algorithmic methods in the global optimization approaches: optimal methods, sub-optimal methods, and soft constraints-based methods. The bio-inspired algorithms are sub-optimal methods. This paper will first present a hierarchical taxonomy of web service concretization approaches. Then we conduct a systematic review on the current research of Web service concretization based on three bio-inspired algorithms, namely, ant colony optimization algorithms, genetic algorithms, and particle swarm optimization algorithms. Based on the findings from the systematic review, this paper also discusses the underlying applications of bio-inspired algorithms to the data-intensive service concretization problems.",

        "abstract": "Silica aerogels are porous materials with unusual properties such as large internal surface area, small refractive index, low thermal conductivity and high visible transparency, etc. They have been used in a variety of applications. Most of the aerogels are hydrophilic and become wet in the presence of atmospheric moisture and get deteriorated with time. Therefore, one of the most important requirements for long-term use of the aerogels is making them hydrophobic. In this paper, hydrophobic aerogels are synthesized from polyethoxydisiloxane (E-40) and use perfluoroaklysilane (PFAS) as a coprecursor. With the increase of the volume ratio of PFAS/E-40, the gelation time, shrinkage rate and density increase. Fourier transform infrared spectra, relative pore size distribution and thermogravimetric analysis are used to characterize the hydrophobic aerogels. The fluoroaklyl groups are successfully incorporated into the silica aerogels in hydrolysis-condensation reactions. BET shows the surface area of the aerogels is larger than that of the as-prepared pure silica aerogels. And it has the largest surface area when the PFAS/E-40 volume ratio is at 0.6. The weight loss of the aerogels is very small up to 500 °C and the contact angle of water to the surface of the aerogels is about 145°.",

The addition of 0.1 wt.% Dy promotes the planar-to-cellular transition. Moreover, the white Dy-containing phase does not form in the alloy for the planar interface growth (6 μm/s), but it can occur in the boundary of eutectic cells for the cellular interface growth (30 μm/s).

The experimental results indicated that the polarization drastically increases with the rise of grid voltage accompanying the breakdown of gas in the void. Also, by means of the charging method mentioned above and analyzing the thermally stimulated discharging spectra, the charge dynamics of macroscope dipoles with space charges and their compensation charges near the free surface of the film during thermal depolarization were discussed. A geometric distribution of trap levels trapping two kinds of charges was discovered, that is, the space charges formed in the macroscopic dipoles were trapped in shallow- and deep -energy level traps respectively, while the space charges located near the free surface of the film were trapped in medium energy level traps.",

        "abstract": "With the development and construction of high peak power lasers it has become more and more important to improve the laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) of optical coatings. In this paper, ZrO2 coatings were deposited by sol-gel dip-coating method and further treated by conventional furnace annealing (CFA) and rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at different temperatures. By measuring the Raman spectra, optical constants and LIDT, the influence of annealing on the crystal structures, refractive indices, laser-induced damage characters of ZrO2 coatings were analyzed. The results show that RTA is effective in tuning the crystal structures of ZrO 2 coatings. Lattice mismatch between monoclinic and tetragonal phases happened on CFA treated film reduces its refractive index, hence the film annealed by RTA at 800 °C realizes a higher refractive index. Compared with CFA annealed films, RTA annealed films were no more susceptible to laser damage due to their crystal structure difference caused lager band gap. © 2012 Optical Society of America.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the usefulness of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) in the assessment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) severity.Liver DCE-MRI at 3.0T was performed in 36 adult Sprague-Dawley rats with methionine choline-deficient diet-induced NAFLD and 10 untreated control rats. Pharmacokinetic parameters of DCE-MRI including K(trans) , Kep , Ve , Vp , and hepatic portal index (HPoI) were measured using the dual-input extended Tofts model. Animals were categorized as normal (n = 10), simple steatosis (SS, n = 11), borderline nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (bNASH, n = 20), and NASH (n = 5) subgroups according to the NAFLD activity score system, and classified into F0 (n = 24), F1 (n = 11), F2 (n = 7), and F3 (n = 4) subgroups according to an established scoring system. DCE-MRI parameters were compared. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed to assess the diagnostic performance of various DCE-MRI parameters in grading NAFLD activity and staging liver fibrosis.K(trans) and HPoI were elevated with increasing severity of NAFLD activity and increased fibrosis stage. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) of HPoI ranged from 0.895-0.951 for discriminating between different grades of NAFLD activity, and the AUROC was 0.852 for discriminating F0 stage from overall F1-F3 stages. The AUROC of K(trans) for discriminating non-NASH from bNASH and NASH groups was 0.968, and 0.898 for discriminating between normal and overall fibrosis groups.DCE-MRI may play a role in assessing NAFLD severity.1 J.

        "abstract": "Silica antireflective coatings modified by hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) were deposited on clean substrates (silicon wafer or K9 glass blanks) by sol-gel processing. The effects of HMDS on the contamination resistant capability and laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) of coatings were investigated. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that a stable sol with uniformly distributed silica particles with an average particle size of about 15 nm was acquired by adding appropriate amount of HMDS into the standard SiO2 sol. With the modified sol the resultant coatings were hydrophobic and the contact angle for water increased with increasing amount of HMDS in the reaction mixture. Such increase in hydrophobicity was not the result of surface roughness. The antireflective properties were retained after HMDS-treatment and the maximum transmission values were above 99 %. The introduction of HMDS into silica sols had also increased the LIDT of coatings from 24.3 to 37.0 J cm -2 when the molar ratio of HMDS to tetraethoxysilane was 0.05:1. The increase in LIDT was attributed to the decrease of nodular defect and uniform microstructures of coatings as an effect of the HMDS modification. After some of the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the SiO2 particle were replaced by methyl groups, from which the SiO2 particle gained a water-repellent surface, the stability of coatings in vacuum was increased. The maximum transmission values of modified coatings decreased by only 0.25 % after storage under vacuum for 168 h. In contrast, the standard sol-gel silica coatings decreased about 2 % under similar conditions. The LIDT of modified coatings remained as high as 30.8 J cm-2, more than that of standard coatings stored for the same duration in air. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

        "abstract": "It is an efficient mode to optimize photocatalytic performance of semiconductors by the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect through constructing composites with noble metal nanoparticles, nevertheless, the understanding for the essential mechanism, especially the LSPR effect on band gap engineering or free radicals, is not clear. Herein, Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were decorated on popular used semiconductors, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C₃N₄), through a microemulsion route. As expected, Ag/g-C₃N₄ hybrid materials demonstrated outstanding photocatalytic decomposition of organic dyes, including methyl orange, phenol and rhodamine B, in which the photocatalytic efficiency of the composite with the optimal ratio of Ag content was 3.37 times higher than that of pristine sample. The mechanism for the better photocatalytic action was attributed to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect, narrow band gap and low valance band position originated from Ag NPs, which resulted in superior visible-light adsorption and the formation of _OH with strong oxidation. As well, because of the synergy between Ag NPs and g-C₃N₄, faster separation of the photogenerated charges and efficiently utilization of the ·OH and ·O₂ generated from hole and electron are realized simultaneously. Ultimately, our results offer a extremely understanding of superior photocatalytic property caused by the LSPR effect.",

        "abstract": "The controlled synthesis of different growth densities of ultra-long AlN nanowires has been successfully realized by nitridation of Al powders for the first time. These AlN nanowires have an average diameter of about 100 nm and their mean length is over 50 μm. All the synthesized ultra-long nanowires are pure single crystalline h-AlN structures with a growth orientation of [0001]. We preferred the self-catalyzing vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism to illustrate their growth process. Although the sample with the middle growth density (3.2×10(7) per cm2) of AlN nanowire performs the best field emission (FE) properties, the emission uniformity is not good enough for field emission display applications, which may be attributed to their low intrinsic conductivity. Moreover, the electrical transport and FE properties of an individual ultra-long AlN nanowire are further investigated in situ to find the decisive factor responsible for their FE behaviors. An individual AlN nanowire is observed to have a mean 1 nA field of 440 V μm(-1) and 1 μA field of 480 V μm(-1) as well as an average electrical conductivity of about 2.7×10(-4)Ω(-1) cm(-1), which is lower than that of some cathode materials with excellent FE properties. Therefore we come to the conclusion that the electrical conductivity of the AlN nanowire must be improved to a higher level by some effective ways in order to realize their practical FE device applications.",

Many methods have been devoted to fabricating AlN nanostructures, but high growth temperature over 800 °C and the use of the catalysts in most methods limit their practical application and result in their poor field-emission behaviours in uniformity. This paper reports that without any catalysts, a simple chemical vapour deposition method is used to synthesize aligned AlN nanocone arrays at 550 °C on silicon substrate or indium tin oxide glass. Field emission measurements show that these nanocones prepared at low temperature have an average turn-on field of 6 V/μm and a threshold field of 11.7 V/μm as well as stable emission behaviours at high field, which suggests that they have promising applications in field emission area. © 2010 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Understanding this phenomenon is of utmost importance in providing a basis for the mechanical-performance control of amorphous solids. However, the underlying mechanisms leading to this cooling-rate-induced softening of amorphous solids have remained elusive, especially the dynamic reasons are neglected. Here, we use a colloidal glass as the model system to directly study this issue. Shear modulus is used as the representative parameter to monitor the stress-bearing properties of colloidal glass. The space-spanning immobile particles, whose population is sensitive to the cooling rate, are found to make the dominant contribution to the shear modulus. The rapid solidification induced softening of colloidal glass is observed to originate from fewer immobile particles formed at higher cooling rates.",

Ability of detecting lymph nodes between conventional MRI and STIR-EPI-DWI was compared, and the difference of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value between metastatic lymph node and normal lymph node was analyzed.DWI was more sensitive in detecting lymph node than conventional MRI. ADC value of metastatic lymph node (0. 766 +/- 0. 119) x 10 (-3) mm(2)/s was significantly lower than that of normal lymph node (0. 975 +/- 0. 179) x 10 - mm2/s (P < 0. 01).As a new MRI imaging technique in detecting cervical lymph nodes, diffusion weighted imaging ( DWI) with short TI version recovery-echo planar imaging ( STIR-EPI) sequence is more reliable and sensitive than conventional MRI imaging, providing an alternative way to differentiate benign lymph nodes from malignant ones.",

        "abstract": "Amorphous carbon film was treated by hydrogen plasma. The change of surface structure, conductivity, and work function distribution is characterized by scanning probe microscope technique and local electron emission is also analyzed. We find that chemical effect of hydrogen plasma on the a-C film is small, but the etching effect is strong and the surface morphology and conductance are obviously changed after hydrogen treatment. Electron emission enhancement is not due to the decrease of work function or existence of sp2 conductive channels, but from the mutual effect between sp2 and sp3 phase. We suggest that the enhancement is due to the internal electron injection from the sp2-rich interface layer into the surface sp3-rich grains. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "The paper presents a Variational Bayesian (VB) method to allow a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to be clustered automatically with its mixture components in order to facilitate the discrimination of what can be regarded as steady-state and transient machine operation. The determination of whether a unit is considered to be in steady-state, or subject to external transients is an important pre-processing scenario for both sensor- and machine-fault detection algorithms, for instance, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based Squared Prediction Error (SPE), which is known to produce excessive `false alarms' when fed with measurements that include transient unit operation. Here, the resulting Variational Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model (VBGMM) method is utilized to discriminate the operational behaviour of industrial gas turbine systems. Daily batches of measurement data from in-the-field systems are used to show that the VBGMM provides a useful pre-processing tool for subsequent diagnostic and prognostic algorithms.",

Pure epoxy resin (0 wt%), 0.1 wt%, 1 wt%, 5 wt%, 10 wt%, and 100 wt% (pure silica aerogel) aerogel/epoxy composites were fabricated and then characterized by dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) and field emission scanning electron microscope. The results showed that small amount of filler efficiently increased the stiffness of the composites, but the stiffness decreased with the increase of the mass fraction of the aerogel in the composites (composites ratio); the glass transition temperature of the composites substantially increased, compared to pure epoxy resin. Also, the compressive modulus of the composites at glassy state, rubbery state, and hardening state were studied, respectively. At last, the effects which presumably affect the properties of aerogel/epoxy composites were discussed. Anchoring effect and interfacial effect were suggested to explain the thermal-mechanical behaviors of the composites with different composite ratio. © The Author(s) 2011.",

The effect of the parameters such as different electrolytes, anodization temperature and the voltage on the nanopore structure was studied. The surface and profile structure through FE-SEM (field emission scanning electron microscopy), the element composition in tiny area of the anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) surface were studied. The result indicates the pore diameter of AAO which is anodized in oxalic acid solution is larger than which anodized in sulfuric acid solution.

The alloy studied exhibits an extraordinary compressive superplastic formability within the supercooled liquid region, typically evidenced by a large compressive strain up to 0.83. The superplastic flow behaviors are strongly dependent on the test temperatures and applied strain rates. At low temperatures or high strain rates, the viscosity measured is found to dramatically decrease with increasing strain rate (i.e., non-Newtonian flow) and a stress overshoot is detected in the first steps of strain. At low strain rates or high test temperatures, the studied glass exhibits a Newtonian flow behavior. The value of activation volume increases with increasing test temperatures. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) films exhibit excellent electron emission properties at very low fields. This has been attributed to the high aspect ratio of CNTs, i.e. their emitting surface can have high local field due to geometrical enhancement. It is found that a new mechanism can be responsible for the enhancement of the local field on the emitting surface of CNTs. This results from the space charge in the vacuum gap, which is readily generated due to the high emission current density of CNTs. Details are given of both experimental and theoretical studies of this effect. The mechanism also accounts for the distinct nonlinearity in Fowler-Nordheim plots often observed with CNTs. The implication of the technical application of our findings is also included.",

Methods: Ten patients who were prepared for musculocutaneous flaps reconstruction for oral cancer under went 64-slice spiral CT angiography. The obtained thin-slice images were reformatted by using maximum intensity projection and volume rendering to evaluate transverse cervical arteries. The visibility and morphological features of the transverse cervical arteries were assessed. Results: The source of the transverse cervical artery was thyrocervical trunk in 15 of 20 (75%) and subclavian artery in remaining 5 of 20 (25%) arteries. The length and the opening diameter at starting point of cervical segment of the transverse cervical arteries were measured as (48.86±1.65) mm and (4.20±0.35) mm, respectively. The length and opening diameter at starting point of thoracic segment of the transverse cervical arteries were (57.21±5.61)mm and (3.31 ± 0.22.)mm. Conclusion: 64-slice spiral CTA could accurately demonstrate the origin, course, morphological features of the transverse cervical artery, therefore is helpful for patient selection and surgical planning of patients in prepare to skin flap surgery.",

        "abstract": "Light-driven electron emission plays an important role in modern optoelectronic devices. However, such a process usually requires a light field either with a high intensity or a high frequency, which is not favor for its implementations and difficult for its integrations. To solve these issues, we propose to combine plasmonic nanostructures with nano-electron-emitters of low work function. In such a heterostructure, hot-electrons generated by plasmon resonances upon light excitation can be directly injected into the adjacent emitter, which can subsequently be emitted into the vacuum. Electron emission of high efficiency can be obtained with light field of moderate intensities and visible wavelengths, which is a plasmon-mediated electron emission (PMEE) process. We have demonstrated our proposed design using a gold-on-graphene (Au-on-Gr) nanostructure, which can have electron emission with light intensity down to 73 mW·cm. It should be noted that the field electron emission is not involved in such a PMEE process. This proposal is of interest for applications including cold-cathode electron sources, advanced photocathodes, and micro- and nano-electronic devices relying on free electrons.",

Nowadays, the self-organization service network has appeared, which is a new network architecture that is service-oriented and supports the dynamic publication, inquiry and exit of services, solving problems caused by diversity, heterogeneity and dynamicity in distributed systems. In view of advantages of the new network, the authors in this paper designed the components that have self-organization features and put forward a remote teaching application system model based on them. With these components, student clients and teacher clients can cooperate with the self-organization service network and solve the problems mentioned above. The article firstly gives the new model, secondly elaborates on the principle of it specifically and lastly validates the feasibility of it through an experiment.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To determine the feasibility of magnetical labeling and tracking rabbit mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vitro. Methods: MSCs isolated from rabbit bone marrow were cultured and expanded. A bi-functional labeling reagent complex was obtained by the incubation linear polyethylenimine derivative (PEI-FluoR) with Gd-DTPA to label the MSCs bi-functionally. After labeling, the MSCs were examined under fluoroscope and electron microscope, and the biological characters were detected using trypan blue exclusion test, MTT and apoptosis detection. On a 1.5 Tesla MR system the labeled MSCs were examined with spin echo T1WI, T2WI and T1-mapping measurement. The minimal amount of labeled MSCs that could be detected by MRI was determined. The labeling duration was determined in the labeled MSCs under routine passage. Results: With the bi-functional agents, the efficacy of labeling MSCs was 80%. After labeling, red fluorescence was found in the cytoplasm of MSCs under fluorescence microscopy and higher density electron particles of gadolinium were found around cellular apparatuses under electron microscopy. There was no statistical difference of trypan blue excusion rate between labeled cells and unlabeled cells within 24 hours of incubation (F=2.17-1.38, P>0.05), nor in the MTT proliferation test between labeled cells and unlabeled cells within 5 days after labeling (F=1.93-0.61, P>0.05). The apoptosis index for labeled cells and unlabeled cells was 0.40% and 0.19%, respectively. The signal intensity on T1WI and T1 relaxation time of unlabeled cells and labeled cells were 2166±167 and (2445±21)ms, 3162±350 and (104±129)ms, respectively (t=6.91, 29.87, P<0.005). The minimal detectable amount of labeled cells was 1×10 4. After routine passage, MRI could detect labeled cells until the third passage. Conclusion: The gadolinium and fluorescent bi-functionally labeling rabbit MSCs using the transfection agent of polyethylenimine is feasible, efficient and safe. The labeled cells can be tracked in vitro on MR imaging.",

This structure consists of peritectic two solid phases, both of which grow with plane fronts in the pulling direction and occupy half width of the sample. A simple model was proposed to explain the formation of the separate growth structure in Fe-Ni alloy.

As a new technique, magnetic resonance perfusion weighted imaging (MR PWI) is gradually applied to clinical study of REP. This study was designed to observe the characteristics of REP of NPC patients on MR PWI, and investigate its diagnostic value.The MRI and MR PWI records of 26 volunteers and 19 NPC patients with 37 lesions of MRI-diagnosed temporal lobe REP were retrospectively analyzed. The MRI was performed 30 months to 9 years after radiation therapy for NPC. The imaging sequences included T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), MR PWI, and Gd-DTPA-contrasted T1WI.Unilateral temporal lobe was involved in 1 case of REP, and bilateral temporal lobes in 18 cases of REP. MR PWI revealed that in edema areas of REP, relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and relative cerebral blood flood (rCBF) were decreased, mean transit time (MTT), time to peak (TTP), and time of arrival (TO) were delayed simultaneously; in demolished blood-brain barrier areas of REP, rCBV and rCBF were normal, but MTT, TTP, and TO were delayed; no blood perfusion was observed in myelinopathy areas of REP.MR PWI can clearly reveal brain blood perfusion changes in various lesions of REP, and indicate that obvious malfunction of brain blood perfusion is occurred in REP.",

        "abstract": "The alloy with composition Ni-45.61Al-7.8Mo (at%) has been directionally solidified by liquid metal cooling (LMC) process. The effect of growth rate on the solidified microstructure such as interface morphology, dendrite growth and primary β phase precipitation, was experimentally investigated. The interface morphology of the β phase undergoes the evolution from plane front, cellular, thick dendrite to thin dendrite with increasing of growth rate for a given temperature gradient. The first dendrite spacing λ1 of the primary β phase increases gradually during the cellular growth, and decreases during the dendrite growth, while the second dendrite spacing λ2 decreases with increasing of the growth rate. The amount of primary β phase increases with the growth rate. And the analysis results show that the varieties of nucleation rate of NiAl caused by melt undercooling variation with different growth rates are responsible for the phenomenon.

Dynamic thermo-mechanical analyzer was used to evaluate the change of the treated wood on different position (compare with the non-compressive control wood). The internal mechanism of compressive solid wood and compressive deformation fixation were discussed by analyzing the effect of steam treatment on dynamic thermo-mechanical parameters of the treated wood, such as loss modulus and loss tangent. The tendency of the wood components such as hemi-cellulose and lignin were also studied in this course. The results showed that with the increasing of surface distance, loss modulus and loss angle tangent decreased in glass state area, the initial glass transition temperature decreased obviously at 0.5 cm away from the surface. So the deformation fixation of the compressive wood is due to the lower molecule weight of lignin and the failure of creep recovery.",

The largest compressive fracture plastic strain of 32.5% with the fracture strength of 2480MPa is achieved for Ti60Cu30Ni10Co4 alloy composite. The enhanced plasticity is attributed to the addition of Co element having a positive heat of mixing with Cu element, and the retardment for the shear band propagation resulted from the dendrites, which are homogeneously distributed in the matrix. The high fracture strength of the alloys is resulted from work hardening character due to a series of dislocations in the dendrites and the unique microstructure of the Ti60Cu30Ni10Co4 alloy, i.e., the coexistence of amorphous phase, nanocrystals, and micron-scale dendrites. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "The diversity of interface morphologies is observed for directionally solidified Sn 0.65%Cd alloy under a travelling magnetic field(TMF) in the 4 mm-diameter sample. Under an upward TMF, planar and cellular interface morphologies transform alternately with increasing magnetic flux density(B≤10.3 mT). The interface morphology transforms from shallow cellular to deep cellular morphology under a weak downward TMF(B=3.2 mT). When the magnetic flux density increases further, both sides of the interface morphology appear to be slightly inconsistent, but they roughly tend to be planar under a strong downward TMF(B≤10.3mT). The interface instability may be attributed to the flow driven by the TMF. Moreover, the shape of interface appears to be almost flat under an upward TMF, but deflective under a downward TMF.",

The results are compared with those from the full configuration interaction, the internally contracted multireference configuration interaction with singles and doubles, the complete active space with second-order perturbation theory, and other theoretical methods (if available).

        "abstract": "Field emission from single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) nonwoven has been investigated under high vacuum with different vacuum gaps. A low turn-on electric field of 1.05 V/μm is required to reach an emission current density of 10 μA/cm2. An emission current density of 10 mA/cm2 is obtained at an operating electric field of 1.88 V/μm. No current saturation is found even at an emission current of 5 mA. With the vacuum gap increasing from 1 to 10 mm, the turn-on field decreases monotonically from 1.21 to 0.68 V/μm, while the field amplification is augmented. The good field-emission behaviour is ascribed to the combined effects of the intrinsic field emission of SWNT and the waved topography of the nonwoven. © 2006 Chin. Phys.

By truncating the cluster operator up to the four-block correlation level, we derive the spin orbital formulation of the CAS-BCCC4 approach. The CAS-BCCC4 approach is invariant to separate unitary transformation within active, occupied, and virtual orbitals. We have implemented the approach and applied this approach to describe the potential energy surfaces for bond breaking processes in C(2) and N(2) and for a simultaneous double bond dissociation in H(2)O. Numerical results show that the CAS-BCCC4 approach provides quite accurate descriptions for the entire dissociation process in each of the studied systems. The overall performance of the present approach is found to be better than that of the internally contracted multireference configuration interaction singles and doubles or complete-active-space second-order perturbation theory. The size-extensivity error is found to be relatively small for N(2).",

The target was composed of SiO 2 and CRF aerogel sheet, whose density and microstructure were controllable. To begin with, freestanding CRF aerogel sheet was prepared by sol-gel and carbonization process. Then, as the seed of the growth of RTI, sine-like perturbation patterns were introduced onto the surface of CRF aerogel sheet by picosecond laser micro-machining process. Finally, SiO 2 aerogel sheet was directly formed on the patterned surface of CRF aerogel sheet by sol-gel process not only to avoid the use of adhesive but also to eliminate the gaps between the two aerogel sheets. The parameters of the target, such as perturbation period (T), perturbation amplitude (A), the thickness of CRF aerogel sheet (H 1) and the thickness of SiO 2 aerogel sheet (H 2), were measured. The pore size distribution, density homogeneity and laser machining process were discussed. The interface between CRF aerogel sheet and SiO 2 aerogel sheet was characterized. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The phenomenon of the apparent changes from NPs networks to microspheres networks after the gelation was similar to normal microsyneresis. However, in-situ composition evolution results indicate that the SA is driven by interparticle dehydration, but not affinity difference between the network for itself and for the solvent. In-situ small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), UV-vis-NIR, and electric conductivity were used to study the microsyneresis process. To further demonstrate the mechanism, extra complexant was added and successfully restrained the NPs-microsphere transition by inactivating the surface hydroxyl of the NPs.

The WO3/SiO2 complex film was synthesized from a two steps process and dip-coating method. The films were characterized with laser particle analyzer, IR, Raman. The studies of gelation time and particle size distribution of WO3/SiO2 sol indicate that the silica addition could largely reduce the polycondensation of WO3 clusters. The reaction between WO3 and SiO 2 were further systematically investigated using IR spectra, and an insight of this reaction was illuminated. Results reveal that Si-OH in SiO 2 sols tended to crosslink with WO3 at the corner-sharing W-O sites, by which only edge-sharing WOx clusters could be detected. This modified the WO3 structure was also approved by the Raman spectra, TEM and AFM images. Moreover, gas sensing properties of the WO 3/SiO2 films were tested. The assembled WO3 films exhibited more stable gas sensing stability than pure WO3 films. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

        "abstract": "W18O49 nanowires exhibit stable field emission at low fields. To explore the potential application of such nanowires in backlight and display devices, it is necessary to achieve uniform emission on a large area. In the present study, the authors demonstrate that field-emission uniformity of large-area samples may be improved by following an electrical-current treatment procedure. This is due to the increase in the number of nanowires that join in the field emission during the process, in which a small number of strong emitters are gradually melted down. The process of self-melting occurring in field emission is studied using a point anode in situ with a scanning electron microscope. The self-melting is attributed to the effect of Joule heating occurring due to passing of current through field electron emitting nanowires. These results are useful for the device application of W18O 49 nanowires as large-area cold cathodes. © 2009 American Vacuum Society.",

        "abstract": "The penetration effects of projectiles impacting rocks are of great significance in the underground protective engineering and the weapon warhead designs. Especially, issue of the overload of the projectiles is more essential as the key technology for the warhead designs, but also great help to make a clear definition of the motion laws of the projectile and the interactions between projectiles and the rock targets. In order to study the overload characteristics of projectiles penetrating rocks, rock-penetrating experiments were carried out using projectiles with diameters φ 100 mm and φ 300 mm, respectively. The overload versus time curve was recorded by means of an overload measurement system. Based on the overload curves, the projectiles overload can be divided into three phases: the overload of rapid increasing as the contact area increases; the overload reducing slowly after the nose enters the targets; and the overload reducing rapidly to zero when the projectile s energy is almost used up. From the achieved overload curves, it can be obtained that the projectiles have the peak overloads when the penetration depths come up to two times the diameter of projectile. The rocks around the projectile s nose are damaged due to the stress wave of penetration, and then, the targets have less ability to prevent the projectiles motion. On the basis of the experimental results, a new formula of penetration depth has been presented here with reference to experimental data of other tests. The precision is not lower within certain range in comparison with the widely accepted Young s formula. Numerical simulation is in good agreement with the experimental results.",

        "abstract": "This study was performed to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of magnetic resonance (MR) microneurography of the rabbit sciatic nerve on a 1.5-T clinical MR system by correlation with the gross anatomy. The 3D T2-weighted imaging (3D-T2WI), 3D T2-weighted imaging plus spectral presaturation with inversion recovery (SPIR), and T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) of the sciatic nerve in ten rabbits were performed on a 1.5-T MR system. The radiological anatomy of the sciatic nerve was observed and correlated with the gross anatomy. The anterior-posterior diameter of the sciatic nerve trunk was measured on 3D T2WI and on gross anatomy. The T1 and T2 relaxation times were also measured with multiecho spin echo and mixed sequence, respectively. The tibial nerve and peroneal nerve in the sciatic nerve trunk in all ten rabbits could be clearly displayed on T2WI and T2WI. The fine branches of the gastrocnemius nerve, posterior femoral cutaneous nerve, and the posterior gluteal nerve could be clearly depicted on T2WI. The T1 and T2 relaxation times of the sciatic nerves were 915 and 40 ms, respectively. The anterior-posterior diameter of sciatic nerve trunk was measured grossly, and on T2WI was 3.17 +/- 0.21 mm and 3.15 +/- 0.19 mm, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference (t = 0.768, P = 0.462). With the 1.5-T clinical MR system, the microneurography of the sciatic nerve could be revisualized, and the finer structure of the sciatic nerve trunk could be clearly and accurately delineated.",

It is found that thermal expansion difference between substrate and layer, in combination with capillary tension caused by water vapor, was responsible for the production of considerable stress inside the sol–gel coating. Initial crack would be generated once this combined stress exceeded the self-relaxation and self-reconstruction capability of this sol–gel AR layer. It is also found that the morphology of most cracks exhibited to be a ridged edge accompanied with a collapse dent. This deformation was also assigned to the combination effect of capillary tension and expansion strain. In addition, a surface barrier was formed on the section of crack, owing to the incorporation between numerous hydroxyl groups and water vapor molecules. Such barrier would result in aggravation of initial cracks, in order to release the internal stress further.",

        "title": "PEM fuel cell reaction kinetics in the temperature range of 23–120°C",
        "abstract": "The performance of a Nafion 112 based proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell was tested at a temperature range from 23 °C to 120 °C. The fuel cell polarization curves were divided into two different ranges based on current density, namely, <0.4 A/cm 2 and >0.4 A/cm 2 , respectively. These two ranges were treated separately with respect to electrode kinetics and mass transfer. In the high current density range, a linear increase in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) power density with increasing temperature was observed, indicating the advantages of high temperature operation. Simulation based on electrode reaction kinetic theory, experimental polarization curves, and measured cathodic apparent exchange current densities all gave temperature dependent apparent exchange current densities. Both the calculated partial pressures of O 2 and H 2 gas in the feed streams and the measured electrochemical Pt surface areas (EPSAs) decrease with increasing temperature. They were also used to obtain the intrinsic exchange current densities. A monotonic increase of the intrinsic exchange current densities with increasing temperature in the range of 23–120 °C was observed, suggesting that increasing the temperature does promote intrinsic kinetics of fuel cell reactions. There are two sets of cathode apparent exchange current densities obtained, one set is for the low current density range, and the other is for the high current density range. The different values of cathode current densities in the two current density ranges can be attributed to the different states of the cathode Pt catalyst surface. In the low current density range, the cathode catalyst surface is a Pt/PtO, and in the high current density range, the catalyst surface becomes pure Pt. Keywords Temperature effect High temperature PEM fuel cells O 2 reduction H 2 oxidation Cathode and anode electrode kinetics Exchange current density Electrochemical Pt surface area (EPSA) Reaction activation energy 1 Introduction In the effort for fuel cell commercialization, during recent years, R&D of the proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) has been concentrated on fuel cell performance improvements such as increasing power density, reducing cost, and increasing reliability/durability [1] . The improvement of fuel cell performance will impact all aspects including stack volume power density (W/L), stack weight power densities (W/kg and Wh/kg), and stack power cost ($/kW). High temperature operation (>80 °C) of a PEMFC has been considered as an effective way to improve the performance in terms of reaction kinetics, catalyst tolerance, heat rejection and water management [2–10] . In the effort to improve performance, the cathodic O 2 reduction reaction (abbreviated as ORR) and/or anode (H 2 oxidation reaction, abbreviated as HOR) kinetics have been considered as one of the determining processes that limits performance, especially in the low current density range (low power applications). It has been expected that ORR and HOR kinetics could improve when the fuel cell is operated at higher temperatures [11,12] . The electrode kinetics of oxygen reduction in simulated fuel cell environments and in PEMFCs has been widely studied in the literature in the low temperature range (<80 °C) [13–19] . For high temperature PEMFC, several papers published in recent years have given some attention to the electrode kinetic approach [11,20–22] . Xu et al. [11] studied the kinetics of the ORR at high temperature. Kinetic parameters such as catalytic activity were investigated using current densities at an overpotential of 0.3 V, which corresponds to a Pt/PtO surface. However, it is very difficult to get consistent values for some kinetic parameters, especially the exchange current density values through the literature. It is believed that apparent exchange current density (AECD) is one of the most important parameters in describing kinetics because it not only contains the intrinsic catalytic activity of the Pt catalyst, but also includes the catalyst layer morphology such as electrochemical Pt surface area (EPSA). Although one cannot do much to increase the intrinsic catalyst activity, the improvement in EPSA through optimizing catalyst supporting strategies, catalyst layer structures, and composition can significantly increase the fuel cell performance. Another important parameter is the Tafel slope of the fuel cell polarization curve (steady-state cell voltage versus current density). This parameter is directly related to kinetic parameters such as the electron transfer coefficient and the number of electrons involved in the rate-determining step. In order to gain a more fundamental understanding about fuel cell reaction kinetics at higher temperatures, fuel cell performance in the temperature range of 23–120 °C is reported in this paper with a focus on the temperature dependence of fuel cell kinetics. Nafion 112 based membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) were used as the baselines to obtain performance at different temperatures. 2 Experimental Nafion 112 (DuPont), used as the proton electrolyte membranes, were treated in 3% H 2 O 2 (aq), 1 M HNO 3 (aq), 1 M H 2 SO 4 (aq), rinsed and then soaked in deionized water for 1 h at 60–80 °C separately, followed by a careful washing step with double distilled water. MEAs, with an active area of 4.4 cm 2 , were prepared by hot pressing the anode, Nafion 112 membrane, and cathode together. Anodes and cathodes consist of Pt/Ru (20% PtRu/C, E-tek) and Pt (20% Pt/C, E-tek), respectively, with a total Pt loading of 1.0 mg/cm 2 . The MEAs were tested in an in-house single cell fed with fully humidified H 2 and air at a fixed flow rate of 0.1 L/min, and 1 L/min, respectively. A blade pressure of 6.7 atm was used to hold the single cell together and provide sufficient electrical contact between the MEA and the graphite bipolar plates. Polarization data at different temperatures and two pressures (0 atm and 3.0 atm) was collected using a Fideris fuel cell test station controlled by FC Power software. Cyclic voltammograms for the EPSA of the cathode catalyst layer were recorded while the fuel cell was simultaneously flushed with N 2 (99.99%) through the cathode compartment and H 2 through the anode compartment. In this case, the anode served as both reference and counter electrodes, and the cathode as a working electrode. For the anode catalyst layer EPSA measurements, the anode side was simultaneously flushed with N 2 and the cathode side with H 2 , where the cathode served as both the reference electrode and the counter electrode. The charges under those two hydrogen surface waves on the volammogram near 150 mV and 230 mV (versus SHE), respectively, were used to estimate the EPSA by adopting a well-recognized value of 210 μC/cm 2 for hydrogen electrochemical adsorption/desorption on a smooth Pt surface. A Solartron 1260 FRA and 1287 potentiostat were used for AC impedance measurements at the cell's open circuit voltage (OCV) conditions with a perturbing amplitude of 5 mV in the frequency range of 7000–0.1 Hz. The purpose of AC impedance experiments at OCV is to obtain the apparent exchange current densities of individual anodic H 2 oxidation and cathodic O 2 reduction reactions. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Polarization curves at different temperatures A Nafion 112 based MEA was used as the baseline to achieve the performance goal in this paper, which is 0.65 V @ 1.0 A/cm 2 at 80 °C, 3.0 atm absolute, and 100% relative humidity (RH) in order to optimize the hardware designs including single cell and test facilities. Fig. 1 shows the polarization curves of a H 2 /air fuel cell operated at 3.0 atm, 100% RH and at different temperatures. At 80 °C, a performance of 0.68 V @ 1.0 A/cm 2 was achieved, which is comparatively higher than those reported at similar operation conditions [20] . These results shown in Fig. 1 are indicative of the state-of-the-art PEMFC performance. The performance at ambient pressure was also obtained (not included in this paper). A performance drop of around 30–60 mV over the whole current density range was observed when the backpressure was controlled to ambient pressure. For all temperatures, the performance has the same trend, that is, the higher the backpressure, the higher the performance. This observation is consistent with that reported by Mallant [23] . It is believed this improvement at higher backpressures is mainly due to the increase in H 2 pressure and O 2 partial pressure in the feed streams as well as an improvement in electrode kinetics. At high pressure, the thermodynamic electrode potential of O 2 will shift to more positive values and that of H 2 will shift to more negative potentials, resulting in a higher cell voltage, which contributes an improvement in cell performance throughout the whole current density range studied. Additionally, as predicted by electrode kinetics theory, an increase in H 2 and O 2 partial pressures leads to higher current densities at the same voltage. It was also observed that the gaps between polarization curves for two backpressures slightly increased with an increase in current density. For example at 80 °C, and 0.1 A/cm 2 , the voltage difference between backpressures (absolute) of 3.0 atm and 1.0 atm was 40 mV, while at 1.0 A/cm 2 with the same backpressures, the voltage difference becomes 60 mV. In the low current density range, as shown in Fig. 1 , among the polarization curves obtained at 23 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C, 80 °C, 100 °C, and 120 °C, the best performance is at ∼80 °C. The performance increases as temperature increases from 23 °C up to 80 °C, after which a further increase to 120 °C leads to a decrease in performance. The performance drop behaviour at high temperatures, ca. 120 °C compared to that at 80 °C has been reported by Song et al. [20] . This performance drop could be attributed to several different effects such as a decrease in catalyst active surface, drying of both the membrane and catalyst layer ionomer, H 2 crossover, a decrease in O 2 and H 2 partial pressures, and a decrease in catalyst layer EPSAs. In the high current density range, all performances dropped rapidly, as shown in Fig. 1 , which is typical of mass transfer limitation. However, an increase in temperature makes a huge difference in this high current density range, due to improvements in mass transfer at higher temperatures. Fig. 2 shows MEA peak power density as a function of temperature. A linear increase in peak power density with increasing temperature can be observed, indicating the benefit of operation at high temperatures. 3.2 Kinetic parameters based on electrode kinetic and mass transfer theories For a H 2 /air (O 2 ) fuel cell, the catalyzed cathode reaction within the catalyst layer is: (I) O 2 + 4 H + + 4 e − ↔ 2 H 2 O and the corresponding anode reaction is: (II) H 2 ↔ 2 H + + 2 e − For the reaction occurring inside porous three-dimensional catalyst layer, a thin-film-flooded agglomerate model has been developed [24,25] to describe the potential–current behaviour as a function of reaction kinetics and reactant diffusion. For simplicity, if the kinetic parameters, such as exchange current density and diffusion limiting current density can be defined as apparent parameters, the corresponding Butler–Volmer and mass diffusion relationships can be expressed as Eqs. (1) and (2) , respectively [26] : (1) I c = i O 2 o 1 − I c I d c f e n α O α O F η c / R T − 1 − I c I d c b e − ( n α O ( 1 − α O ) F η c / R T )   ( Cathode   reaction   ( I ) ) (2) I a = i H 2 o 1 − I a I d a f e n α H α H F η a / R T − 1 − I a I d a b e − ( n α H ( 1 − α H ) F η a / R T )   ( Anode   reaction   ( II ) ) In Eqs. (1) and (2) , R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol/K), T the temperature (K), I c and I a the cathode and anode current densities, respectively, while i O 2 o   and   i H 2 o are the apparent exchange current densities for cathodic O 2 reduction and anodic H 2 oxidation reactions, respectively. I d c f   and   I d c b are the apparent diffusion limiting current densities for the cathodic forward and backward reactions, respectively, and I d a f   and   I d a b are the corresponding apparent diffusion limiting current densities for anode reactions. It is assumed that these six apparent current densities are all a function of the morphology and structure of the three-dimensional catalyst layer matrix [27] . η c and η a in Eqs. (1) and (2) are the cathodic and anodic overpotentials, respectively. η c can be expressed as E c r − E c , and η a can be expressed as E a − E a r , where E c r   and   E a r are the thermodynamic electrode potentials (or reversible electrode potentials) for cathodic O 2 reduction and anodic H 2 oxidation, respectively. However, E c r can be depressed by a surface Pt–O 2 reaction and a H 2 crossover oxidation, which will be discussed in more detail later in this paper. n α O and n α H in Eqs. (1) and (2) are the electron transfer numbers in the rate-determining steps for the cathodic O 2 reduction and anodic H 2 oxidation reactions, respectively. For hydrogen oxidation on Pt/C catalysts, the value of n α H is 2.0, which is widely reported in literature [28–30] . For the value of n α O , two situations should be considered. In the literature, the oxygen reduction polarization curve has two Tafel slopes [12,14,15,17,31–35] . In the low current density range (higher cathode potential range where the electrode surface is partially covered by PtO), the slope is ∼60 mV/decade at 25 °C, which is corresponding to a n α O value of 2.0. The second Tafel slope in the high current density range is around 120 mV/decade at 25 °C with a n α O value of 1.0. Parthasarathy et al. [14] explained that the rate-determining step for O 2 reduction is different at different current densities. At low current densities, a chemical step following the initial fast charge transfer is the rate-determining step, under Langmuir conditions. At higher current densities, the first electron transfer step might be the rate-determining step, leading to a Tafel slope of 120 mV/decade. Perry et al. [36] proposed that the double Tafel slopes are due to the control of O 2 reduction in fuel cells by both the ORR and O 2 mass transport. This postulation was based on the porous electrode model. However, on a pure Pt electrode surface, double Tafel slopes were observed using either Nafion membrane as the electrolyte [14] or an aqueous acid as the electrolyte [32,33,37] . Therefore, the double Tafel slopes are likely due to the difference in reaction mechanisms between that on a pure Pt surface and that on a Pt/PtO surface (see below). α O and α H in Eqs. (1) and (2) are the electron transfer coefficients for cathodic O 2 reduction and anodic H 2 oxidation, respectively. On a Pt electrode, α O is a temperature dependent parameter in the temperature range of 20–250 °C as reported in the literature [12,38–41] , and can be expressed as: α O = α O 0 T , where α O 0 equals 0.001678 at 25 °C. However, α H for H 2 oxidation on a Pt electrode seems to be independent of temperature and the well-recognized value of 0.5 is widely reported in the literature [29,42–44] . For the cathode, the Pt catalyst surface state is strongly dependent on electrode potential. A surface cyclic voltammogram of the cathode (not shown) showed that when the cathode potential is >∼0.8 V (versus NHE) (low fuel cell current density range), the Pt catalyst surface will be covered partially by a PtO layer with surface coverage of ∼0.3 [45] . Only when the cathode potential is lower than 0.8 V (high current density range), can the catalyst surface be entirely pure Pt. It has been demonstrated that the kinetics of O 2 electroreduction on a pure Pt surface is different from that on PtO surface [33] . In this paper, the two current density ranges will be treated separately to reflect this difference between Pt and Pt/PtO catalyst surfaces. The reaction in the low current density range, where the catalyst surface is partially covered by PtO, will be a pure electron transfer controlled process. Therefore, reactant mass transfer processes will not be considered. In the high current density range where the catalyst surface is a pure Pt surface, the reaction could be controlled by both electron transfer and mass transfer processes. Thus the two processes have to be considered simultaneously. For the anode side, the electrode potential is not positive enough to yield an PtO surface. Thus, the H 2 oxidation reaction could only occur on a pure Pt surface throughout the whole current density range studied. In a similar fashion for the cathodic reaction, in the low current density range, only the electron transfer process of anodic H 2 oxidation is considered. In the high current density range, both electron transfer and mass transfer processes will be accounted for simultaneously. 3.3 Fuel cell voltage The measured fuel cell voltage ( V cell ) can be expressed as Eq. (3) : (3) V cell = E OCV − η c − η a − I cell R m where E OCV ( = E c r − E a r ) is the fuel cell open circuit voltage, I cell the fuel cell current density, R m the MEA resistance dominated by the membrane resistance, and η c and η a are the overpotentials as defined in Eqs. (1) and (2) , respectively. According to Eqs. (1) and (2) , it is impossible to derive the analytical expressions for η c and η a as a function of fuel cell current density. In order to obtain E OCV , i O 2 o , i H 2 o , I d c f ,   and   I d a f by simulating the performances in Fig. 1 according to Eq. (3) , η c , η a , R m , α O , α H , n O , and n H must be known. Fortunately, the membrane resistance, R m , can be experimentally measured, and parameters α O , α H , n O , and n H can be obtained by adopting well-recognized values from literature. As described later in this paper, other parameters such as E OCV , i O 2 o , i H 2 o , I d c f , I d a f , η c ,   and   η a can be simulated separately in low and high current density ranges. 3.4 Low current density range In the low current density range, the contribution from mass transfer polarization can be negligible, and the electrode charge transfer and membrane resistance polarization are significant. In this case, Eqs. (1) and (2) can be simplified into Eqs. (4) and (5) , respectively: (4) I c = i O 2 o ( e ( n α O α O F η c / R T ) − e − ( n α O ( 1 − α O ) F η c ) / ( R T ) ) (5) I a = i H 2 o ( e n α H α H F η a / R T − e − ( n α H ( 1 − α H ) F η a ) / ( R T ) ) From the AC impedance spectra, the exchange current density of the ORR can be calculated from the charge transfer resistance (see below). The numerical relationship between η c and I c can thus be obtained. Then by inputting η c into Eq. (3) , η a and E OCV can be simulated. In the simulation, the linear relationship between η a and I cell in the low current density range (<0.4 A/cm 2 ) was adjusted to pass through the zero point on the η a − I cell graph by adjusting the E OCV value. 3.5 Measurement of the cathode apparent exchange current densities [47] As described in the experimental section, AC impedance spectra were measured at OCV conditions. Fig. 3 shows a Nyquist plot at 80 °C, 3 atm absolute backpressure and 100% RH. At the high frequency end, the curve intersect at the X -axis is the membrane resistance ( R m ). The measured R m values for the Nafion 112 membrane at different temperatures are listed in Table 1 , which were more or less constant with exception of a slight increase with increasing temperature. The diameter of the semicircle ( R c t OCV ) is the charge transfer resistance at OCV. Proposed equivalent circuit for the H 2 oxidation and O 2 reduction reactions is shown as inserts in Fig. 3 . The resistances, R c and R a , are the charge transfer resistances of cathodic O 2 reduction and anodic H 2 oxidation, respectively, and their corresponding double layer capacitances can be expressed as C c and C a . The measured R c t OCV is the sum of both sides (anode and cathode), that is, R c t OCV = R c + R a . As R c ≫ R a , R c t OCV ≅ R c . At OCV conditions, if the perturbing voltage amplitude is very small (<5 mV in this paper) so that the overpotential, η c or η a is much smaller than RT / n α O α O F or RT / n α H α H F , Eqs. (4) or (5) can be approximated as Eqs. (6) and (7) , respectively: (6) η c = R T n α O F i O 2 o I c (7) η a = R T n α H F i H 2 o I a As a result, i H 2 − P t o ≫ i O 2 − Pt / PtO o [46] , and the resulting polarization, η c + η a , via current perturbation, should be dominated by η c , that is, η c + η a ≈ η c . For AC impedance measurements, using a very small perturbing AC current at OCV, the obtained R c t OCV can be expressed as Eq. (8) by differentiating Eq. (6) : (8) R c t OCV = ∂ η c ∂ I c = R T n α o F i O 2 o Based on Eq. (8) , the apparent exchange current density of O 2 reduction can be calculated if R c t OCV and n α O (=2.0) are known. The obtained AECD for O 2 reduction reactions at different temperatures are listed in Table 1 . The E OCV and i H 2 o values simulated according to Eqs. (2) and (3) are listed in Table 1 . The calculated polarization curves based on the parameters listed in Table 1 are shown in Fig. 4 (a–c) for current densities <0.4 A/cm 2 . Fig. 4 (d) shows the comparison between simulated fuel cell performance and those measured at different temperatures for current densities < 0.4 A/cm 2 . The simulated data are fairly consistent with the measured ones for each curve, confirming the parameters listed in Table 1 are reliable. It may be worthwhile to point out that the anode overpotential ( Fig. 4 (c)) may not be insignificant when compared to those of cathode and membrane polarizations, especially for the low temperature cases, where the anode overpotentials are large enough to make a significant contribution to the overall polarization. In fuel cell performance simulation and modeling literature, anode polarization was neglected by assuming that its overpotential is significantly smaller than that of cathodic side. The contribution of anode overpotential (AO%) to the overall polarization can be defined as shown in Eq. (9) : (9) AO % = η a η a + η c + η m where η m is the contribution portion of membrane resistance ( I c R m ). For example, at 80 °C, at 0.4 A/cm 2 , the anode overpotential is 10 mV, the cathode overpotential is 174 mV, and the membrane voltage drop is 41 mV. The percentage of the anode overpotential in the total polarization based on Eq. (9) is about 4.4%. However, at room temperature, the percentage is about 10%, which should not be neglected when simulating experimental fuel cell performance. If the anode overpotential is negligible, that is η a = 0, and fuel cell current density ( I cell ) is much larger than i O 2 o in Eq. (4) , Eq. (3) can be simplified as: (10) V cell = E OCV + R T 0.001678 T n α o F   ln ( i O 2 o ) − R T 0.001678 T n α o F   ln ( I cell ) − I cell R m Eq. (10) is the most popular expression for fuel cell polarization in the literature [18,19] . The constant RT /0.001678 Tn α O F in Eq. (10) is normally defined as the Tafel slope. Strictly speaking, this equation is not the best way for describing a continuous polarization curve because I cell is not allowed to be close to or equal to zero. As a matter of fact, it is in this low current density range that accurate electrode kinetic parameters can be simulated. This equation is also not applicable to the situation when the anode overpotential is no longer negligible. Another confusing point in the literature is treating the term of E OCV + ( R T / 0.001678 T n α o F )   ln ( i O 2 o ) in Eq. (10) as the OCV. In Table 1 , the simulated E OCV s are all lower than those theoretically calculated. This is due to two factors: mixed potential of the cathode for a Pt/PtO surface, and hydrogen crossover from anode to cathode. This issue is discussed in more detail in another paper [47] . As shown in Fig. 1 , the fuel cell performance in low current density increases with increasing temperature from 23 °C to 80 °C, then decreases when the temperature further increased from 80 °C to 120 °C. This behaviour has a similar pattern to the apparent exchange current densities listed in Table 1 . For comparison, Fig. 5 shows apparent exchange current density curves and cell performance as a function of temperature. It is obvious that the performance drop with increasing temperature in the range of 80–120 °C is due to the decrease in AECD value with increasing temperature. There may be two major factors contributing to the decrease of AECDs with increasing temperature from 80 °C to 120 °C. The first is the rapid drop in O 2 and H 2 partial pressures as calculated according to fuel cell feed conditions [47] , and the other is the reduction of the electrochemical Pt surface area of the catalyst layers. The AECDs of cathodic O 2 reduction and anodic H 2 oxidation may be expressed as Eqs. (11) and (12) , respectively: (11) i O 2 o = ( EPSA ) c i O 2 ( Pt / PtO ) o P O 2 P O 2 o 0.001678 T (12) i H 2 o = ( EPSA ) a i H 2 ( Pt ) o P H 2 P H 2 o 0.5 where (EPSA) c and (EPSA) a are the electrochemical Pt surface areas of cathode and anode catalyst layers, respectively, with a unit of cm 2 Pt surface per cm 2 electrode geometric area (cm 2 /cm 2 ); i O 2 ( Pt / PtO ) o   and   i H 2 ( Pt ) o are the intrinsic exchange current densities (IECDs) of O 2 reduction on a Pt/PtO surface and H 2 oxidation on a Pt surface; P O 2   and   P H 2 are the partial pressures of O 2 and H 2 in the feed streams; and P O 2 o   and   P H 2 o are the standard pressures of O 2 and H 2 . As described in Section 2 , (EPSA) c and (EPSA) a can be obtained by surface cyclic voltammetry measurements. The obtained values are listed in Table 2 . It can be seen that both (EPSA) c and (EPSA) a drop significantly with increasing temperature, suggesting that the number of active Pt catalyst site for fuel cell reactions are reduced dramatically, resulting in a decrease in the AECD. This phenomenon has been previously reported by Song et al. [20] . Currently it is not very clear why an increase in temperature leads to a decrease in EPSA. One possibility is that the water content inside the catalyst layer is reduced with increasing temperature. It is believed that the active sites on a Pt catalyst are those covered by a thin water and Nafion (if any) film, and that the areas which are not covered by such water and Nafion films should not be involved in the reaction. With water content decreasing with increasing temperature, the area covered by the thin layer of water could be reduced, resulting in a reduction of the EPSA. As listed in Table 1 , the IECDs for both O 2 reduction and H 2 oxidation were calculated based on Eqs. (11) and (12) according to the partial pressure and EPSA data listed in Table 2 . Both IECDs for the anode and cathode increase monotonically with increasing temperature, indicating that temperature does promote fuel cell intrinsic reaction kinetics. The observed drop in fuel cell performance for temperatures greater than 80 °C is mainly caused by partial pressure drop of feed gas and reduction in the EPSA. 3.6 High current density range In the high current density range, the diffusion related terms in Eqs. (1) and (2) must be considered. As a result, at the high overpotentials (both η c and η a are large), the second terms in the brackets of Eqs. (1) and (2) will be insignificant compared to the first terms, suggesting that they could be negligible. Therefore, Eqs. (1) and (2) can be simplified as Eqs. (13) and (14) , respectively: (13) I c = i O 2 o 1 − I c I d c f e n α O α O F η c / R T (14) I a = i H 2 o 1 − I a I d a f e n α H α H F η a / R T Eq. (3) then can be expressed as Eq. (15) : (15) V cell = E OCV + R T 0.001678 T n α O F   ln ( i O 2 o ) + R T 0.5 n α H F   ln ( i H 2 o ) − R T 0.001678 T n α O F   ln I cell I d c f I d c f − I cell − R T 0.5 n α H F   ln I cell I d a f I d a f − I cell − I cell R m where i O 2 o is the apparent exchange current density for cathodic O 2 reduction on the Pt surface which should be a different value from that listed in Table 1 because the O 2 reduction occurs on a pure Pt surface rather than on a Pt/PtO surface. The electron number ( n α O ) in Eq. (15) should accordingly be taken as 1.0 rather than 2.0. It is believed that i H 2 o in Eq. (15) should have the same value as listed in Table 1 because in both low and high current density ranges only the pure Pt surface is involved. There are three parameters which need to be simulated: i O 2 o , I d c f ,   and   I d a f . Some uncertainties exist if too many parameters are simultaneously involved in the simulation. Fortunately, as an estimation, the relationship between I d c f   and   I d a f could be calculated if the thicknesses of the cathode and anode catalyst layers (defined as L c and L a , respectively), the concentrations of O 2 and H 2 (defined as C O 2   and   C H 2 , respectively), and the diffusion coefficients of O 2 and H 2 (defined as D O 2   and   D H 2 , respectively) are roughly known. According to diffusion theory [26] , the relationship between I d c f   and   I d a f can be roughly expressed as Eq. (16) : (16) I d a f = 0.5 D H 2 D O 2 C H 2 C O 2 L c L a I d c f where L c and L a are about 20 μm and 15 μm, respectively, for the MEA used in this study. As reported in the literature [48,49] , while C H 2 is temperature independent, D O 2 , D H 2 , C O 2 , C H 2 are all temperature dependent, and can be expressed as: (17) D O 2 = 3.1 × 10 − 3   exp − 2768 T (18) D H 2 = 4.1 × 10 − 4   exp − 2602 T (19) C O 2 = P O 2 K O 2 = P O 2 e ( − ( 666 / T ) + 14.1 ) (20) C H 2 = P H 2 K H 2 = P O 2 4.5 × 10 4 In Eqs. (17)–(20) , T is the temperature in Kelvin, and K O 2 as well as K H 2 are Henry's constants in atm cm 3 /mol. Values of i O 2 o , I d c f ,   and   I d a f listed in Table 3 were obtained from a simulation based on Eqs. (15) and (16) in the high current density range. In the simulation, the theoretical values of E OCV listed in Table 3 were used. It is believed that in the high current density range, the Pt/PtO surface does not exist, and H 2 crossover is negligible due to the depletion in surface concentration on the anode surface. Therefore, the fuel cell OCV should be the same as the theoretical one. The intrinsic exchange current densities were also calculated in a similar way to Eq. (11) based on the partial pressures of O 2 in the feed stream, and on the cathode catalyst EPSA. Fig. 6 compares the polarization curves simulated according to Eqs. (15) and (16) with those measured at different temperatures. It can be seen that the simulated curves are fairly fitted with those measured data points, suggesting that Eq. (15) is valid for the performance simulation. All three parameters ( i O 2 o , I d c f ,   and   I d a f ) show a monotonic increase with increasing temperature. The values of i O 2 o in the high current density range are different from those in the low current density range, probably a reflection of the difference in catalytic activity between Pt/PtO and Pt surfaces. 3.7 Reaction activation energies The relationship between activation energy and the IECD should follow the Arrehnius theory: (21) i O 2 ( Pt / PtO ) o = I O 2 ( Pt / PtO ) o e − ( E O 2 ( Pt / PtO ) ) / ( R T )   ( Low   current   density   range ) (22) i O 2 ( Pt ) o = I O 2 ( Pt ) o e − ( E O 2 ( Pt ) ) / ( R T )   ( High   current   density   range ) (23) i H 2 ( Pt ) o = I H 2 ( Pt ) o e − ( E H 2 / R T )   ( Whole   current   density   range ) where I O 2 ( Pt / PtO ) o   and   I O 2 ( Pt ) o   and   I H 2 ( Pt ) o are the intrinsic exchange current densities of cathode O 2 reduction in the low and high current density ranges, respectively. I H 2 ( Pt ) o is the anode H 2 oxidation. E O 2 (or E O 2 ( Pt ) ) and E H 2 are the activation energies for cathode and anode reactions, respectively. Fig. 7 shows the logarithm of IECDs as a function of the reciprocal of temperature. From the slopes of the three plots, activation energies can be obtained. An activation energy of 34.6 kJ/mol for anode H 2 oxidation was obtained. This value is close to the reported value of 35 kJ/mol on Pt supported on WO 3 –ZrO 2 [50] . However, it is much larger than that for bulk or single crystal Pt surfaces (10–18 kJ/mol) [30,51] . The activation energy of hydrogen oxidation on a Pt electrode is structure sensitive [51,52] . The deviation may be due to the structural difference between bulk Pt electrodes and supported PtRu nanoparticles. In this work, anode catalyst is PtRu/C. It is known that H 2 oxidation occurs more easily on Pt/C than does on PtRu/C [53] . Activation energy values of 28.3 kJ/mol and 57.3 kJ/mol were obtained for cathodic O 2 reduction in the low current density range (on Pt/PtO surface), and in the high current density range (on pure Pt surface), respectively. In the literature, values of 21–25 kJ/mol on Pt and Pt alloy surfaces [52] , 73.2 kJ/mol [12] , up to 82.5 kJ/mol in PEM fuel cells with sputtered Pt as the catalyst [13] on oxide covered Pt surfaces have been reported. At low current density, the value is within the range, and close to that reported in the literature [52] . However, in the literature, it was also reported that the activation energy of ORR on a PtO surface is about 16 kJ/mol higher than that on a pure Pt surface [12,54] , which is based on the assumption that the first charge transfer step is the rate-determining step at both current densities. We found that the activation energy on a pure Pt surface reported here is higher than that on a PtO surface, indicating that the rate-determining step in the two current density ranges is different as well. The difference in catalyst structure between the Pt nanoparticles supported on carbon and Pt bulk electrodes probably plays a very important role. For example, it has been reported that in PEM fuel cells, a sputtered Pt electrode showed an activation energy of 63 kJ/mol for the ORR, while the unsputtered electrode gave a value of 82.5 kJ/mol [18] . 4 Conclusion Temperature dependent performances of Nafion 112 based MEAs were obtained in order to simulate the kinetic parameters for PEM fuel cells in the temperature range of 23–120 °C. An increase in temperature leads to an increase in fuel cell performance from room temperature up to 80 °C, after which, a further increase in temperature results in a change in the current density dependent performance. That is, at low current density, an increase in temperature leads to a decrease in performance, and at high current densities, the temperature increase leads to an increase in performance. The best performance was observed at around 80 °C, with 3.0 atm absolute backpressure and 100% RH. A higher backpressure always gives better performance. The simulation based on electrode reaction kinetic theory, experimental polarization curves, and measured cathodic apparent exchange current densities in the kinetically-dominated current density range (<0.4 A/cm 2 ) gave the temperature dependent apparent exchange current densities of anodic H 2 oxidation. The partial pressure of O 2 and H 2 gas in the fuel cell feed streams were calculated and the electrochemical Pt surface areas of the cathode and anode catalyst layers at different temperatures were measured. The obtained partial pressures and EPSAs were then used to calculate the intrinsic exchange current densities, which show a monotonic increase with increasing temperature in the range of 23–120 °C. This monotonic increase with temperature suggests that increasing temperature does promote intrinsic fuel cell reaction kinetics. At low current densities, a drop in fuel cell performance at temperatures greater than 80 °C is mainly caused by a drop in feed gas partial pressure and by a reduction in EPSA. The decrease in EPSA with increasing temperature could be attributed to the reduction of water content inside the catalyst layers at higher temperatures. The reaction activation energies for cathodic O 2 reduction and anodic H 2 oxidation were obtained, respectively, from the temperature dependence of intrinsic exchange current densities according to Arrehnius theory.

WO3 thin films were prepared on silicon chips and ordinary slide glasses via Dip Master method and annealed in ambient air at temperatures of 50, 150, 250, 350 and 450°C, respectively. Thickness and refractive index of the WO3 thin films were researched by Spectroscopic EUipsometer. Surface morphology and microstructure of the films were analyzed with AFM, IR and XRD respectively. The annealing temperature have an important effect on the structure and gaschromic properties of WO3 thin films. At low annealing temperature, WO3 thin films is amorphous and porous structure, and the water of WO3 thin films is appropriate, then this kind of WO3 thin films have a good gaschromic properties.",

Experimental evidence and numerical simulation show that atomic-scale bonding between the BMG and the crystalline aluminum can be achieved, and the weldment on the BMG side can retain its amorphous state without any indication of crystallization in the welding process. Nanoindentation tests reveal that the interface of the explosive joints exhibits a significant increase in hardness compared to the matrix on its two sides. The joining of BMG and crystalline materials opens a window to the applications of BMGs in engineering. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.",

Using different catalysts and control methods, the mol ratio of reactors and other experimental parameters, were determined and the SiO2 sols with different particles were prepared by hydrolysis and condensation reaction of TEOS diluted in ethanol. SiO2 coatings derived from such sols were prepared with the desired optical parameters of antireflection coating. The optical parameters of the coating are measured by ellipsometer and alpha-step apparatus, and the microstructure is observed by SEM while the reflectivity is shown by spectrophotometer.",

In the case of continuous heating, three exothermic crystallization peaks can be observed, and the peak temperatures display a strong dependence on the heating rates, which can be fitted by a first order decay equation. The activation energies for crystallization are estimated to be E p1 =166.83±8.85 kJ/mol, E p2 =256.15±9.34 kJ/mol, E p3 =174.36±12.56 kJ/mol, which correspond to peak temperatures of T p1 , T p2 , and T p3 , respectively, indicating the formation of different crystallization phases at different stages. In the case of isothermal annealing, the crystallization products under isothermal annealing were observed and determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The precipitation phases of the sample heated at higher temperatures were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD), showing that the body-centered tetragonal (bct) Zr 2 Cu and hexagonal ZrBe 2 are the primary phases, in spite of the presence of other phases. These results are consistent with the complexity of the DSC curves obtained during the continuous heating and isothermal annealing.",

Silicate sols were prepared with the precursor of TEOS and template of CTAB catalyzed by hydrochloric acid. The films were prepared by dip-coating process. FTIR, XRD and AFM were employed to characterize the films. The dielectric constants were measured by impedance analysis apparatus. These films with dielectric constants smaller than 2.2 could be acquired by adjusting the concentration of CTAB and aging time.",

        "abstract": "Personalisation is becoming more important in the area of mobile learning. Learner model is logically partitioned into smaller elements or classes in the form of learner profiles, which can represent the entire learning process. Machine learning techniques have the ability to detect patterns from complicated data and learn how to perform activities based on learner profiles. This paper focuses on a systematic approach in reasoning the learner contexts to deliver adaptive learning content. A fuzzy rule base model that has been proposed in related work is found insufficient in deciding all possible conditions. To tackle this problem, this paper adopts the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) approach to determine all possible conditions. ANFIS uses the hybrid (least-squares method and the back propagation gradient descent method) as learning mechanism for the Neural Network to determine the incompleteness in the decision made by human experts. The simulating results by Matlab indicate that the performance of ANFIS approach is valuable and easy to implement.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of femoral marrow MR imaging as predictor of outcome for hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in beta-thalassemia major. MR imaging of the proximal femur, including T1- and T2-weighted spin echo and short-tau inversion recovery and in-phase and out-of-phase fast field echo images, was prospectively performed in 27 thalassemia major patients being prepared for HSCT. The area of red marrow and its percentage of the proximal femur were measured, and the presence of marrow hemosiderosis was assessed. Age-adjusted multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between red marrow area percentage and marrow hemosiderosis and HSCT outcome. Red area percentage were less in patients with successful (90.25 +/- 4.14%) compared to unsuccessful transplants (94.54% +/- 2.93%; p = 0.01). Red marrow area percentage correlated positively with duration of symptoms(r = 0.428, p = 0.026) and serum ferritin (r = 0.511, p = 0.006). In multivariate-adjusted logistic regression analyses, red marrow area percentage was significantly inversely associated with successful HSCT (OR = 1.383, 95% CI: 1.059-1.805, p = 0.005). Marrow hemosidersosis and duration of sympotms and serum ferritin were not associated with HSCT outcome(p = 0.174, 0.974, 0.762, respectively). Red marrow area percentage of proximal femur on MR imaging is a useful predictor of HSCT outcome.",

Materials and Methods 148 healthcare workers with recovered SARS from 5 hospitals in Guangzhou were examined with MR imaging of the lower extremity including bilateral hips and knees. Of 148 healthcare workers, 42 cases had not treated with steroid, while 106 cases had treated with varied dosage steroid. The imaging protocol was consisted of screening and full examination. Coronal T1 weighted imaging and short T1 inversion recovery sequences were defined as the screening examination. The full examination was complement to the screening examination, transverse and coronal T2 weighted imaging and short T1 inversion recovery sequences were used. Results Of 42 cases without the treatment of steroid, none was found with the necrosis of lower extremity. Of 106 cases treated with steroid, 8 cases were found ischemia change in the lower extremity. Osteonecrosis of bilateral femoral head was found in 1 case,unilateral femoral head osteonecrosis in 2 cases, bilateral femoral heads and biilateral femoral condyle and tibial condyle concomitantly involved in 1 case, unilateral femoral condyle necrosis was found in 1 case. Femoral neck infarction with significant calcification occurred in 1 case. Bilateral femoral and tibial marrow edema were found in 2 cases. Results of multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed that cumulative prednisone-equivalent was the most important risk factor for osteonecrosis (P=0.001). Conclusion Osteonecrosis is occurred in the minority of healthcare workers with recovered SARS treated with steroid. The cumulative prednisone-equivalent dose is closely related to the occurrence of avascular necrosis.",

Students nowadays are able to learn anywhere and at any time. Mobile learning application content is one of several factors within various contexts that play an important role in the success of the adaptation process. The vast amount of data involved in any successful adaptation process creates complexity and poses serious challenges. This paper focuses on how to model the learner and all possible contexts in an extensible way that can be used for personalisation in mobile learning. The enhanced learner modelling structure to be used in a mobile learning system is proposed.

        "abstract": "Abstract Purpose To determine the predictive CT imaging features for risk stratifications in patients with primary gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs). Materials and methods One hundred and twenty-nine patients with histologically confirmed primary GISTs (diameter >2 cm) were enrolled. CT imaging features were reviewed. Tumour risk stratifications were determined according to the 2008 NIH criteria where GISTs were classified into four categories according to the tumour size, location, mitosis count, and tumour rupture. The association between risk stratifications and CT features was analyzed using univariate analysis, followed by multinomial logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results CT imaging features including tumour margin, size, shape, tumour growth pattern, direct organ invasion, necrosis, enlarged vessels feeding or draining the mass (EVFDM), lymphadenopathy, and contrast enhancement pattern were associated with the risk stratifications, as determined by univariate analysis (P < 0.05). Only lesion size, growth pattern and EVFDM remained independent risk factors in multinomial logistic regression analysis (OR = 3.480–100.384). ROC curve analysis showed that the area under curve of the obtained multinomial logistic regression model was 0.806 (95 % CI: 0.727–0.885). Conclusion CT features including lesion size, tumour growth pattern, and EVFDM were predictors of the risk stratifications for GIST. Key Points • CT features were of predictive value for risk stratification of GISTs. • Tumour size, growth patterns, and EVFDM were risk predictors of GISTs. • Large size, mixed growth pattern, or EVFDM indicated high risk GIST.",

Silica aerogel structure can be effectively controlled by changing experimental parameter. Ultralow density silica aerogel with density as low as 3.4 mg/cm3 has been successfully prepared. Transmission electron microscope (TEM), gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and particle size analyzer were used to characterize the properties of the microstructure and particle distribution of the sol. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to characterize the microstructure of the aerogels. Structure controlling by changing the catalysis condition during sol-gel process was researched, and stabilization of the sol during long-time reserving was researched too. The results showed that silica sol particle can be controlled from 4nm to 9nm continuously and the optimized refluxing time was about 24 hours. © 2006 IEEE.",

This paper argues for the need to place ontologies at the centre of the software development lifecycle for multi agent systems to enhance reuse of software workproducts as well as to unify agent-based software engineering knowledge. The paper bridges the state-of-the-art of ontologies research from Knowledge Engineering (KE) within Artificial Intelligence and Metamodelling within Software Engineering (SE).

        "abstract": "Whether probiotics are beneficial at all stages of treatment in inflammatory bowel disease or superior to placebo remains controversial.Two reviewers independently selected randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with controls in inflammatory bowel disease and extracted data related to remission/response rates, relapse rates, and adverse events. Subanalyses were also performed.Twenty-three randomized controlled trials with a total of 1763 participants met the inclusion criteria. From the meta-analysis, probiotics significantly increase the remission rates in patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC) (P = 0.01, risk ratio [RR] = 1.51). The remission rates were significantly higher in patients with active UC treated with probiotics than placebo (P < 0.0001, RR = 1.80). Unfortunately, subgroup analysis found that only VSL#3 significantly increased the remission rates compared with controls in patients with active UC (P = 0.004, RR = 1.74). Interestingly, VSL#3 (P < 0.00001, RR = 0.18) also significantly reduced the clinical relapse rates for maintaining remission in patients with pouchitis. No significantly different adverse events were detected between probiotics and controls in the treatment of UC (P = 0.94, RR = 0.99) or CD (P = 0.33, RR = 0.87).Administration of probiotics results in additional benefit in inducing remission of patients with UC. VSL#3 are beneficial for maintaining remission in patients with pouchitis. And, probiotics can provide the similar effect as 5-aminosalicylic acid on maintaining remission of UC, although no additional adverse events presented.",

In this work, we investigated the effects of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) content and the application of a micro-porous layer (MPL) in the gas diffusion layer (GDL) on the water transport rate across the GDL. The results show that both PTFE and the MPL play a similar role of restraining water transport. The effects of different carbon loadings in the MPL on water transport were also investigated. The results demonstrate that the higher the carbon loading in the MPL, the more it reduces the water transport rate. Using the given cell hardware and components, the optimized operation conditions can be obtained based on a water balance analysis.",

The photoinduced current increase is reduced with increasing emission current and is undetectable when the emission current is higher than 15 μA. On the other hand, a long time illumination of the sample decreases the field emission current.

They could be recognized by nucleic acid (NA) sensors like toll-like receptor (TLR), leading to activation of the innate immune system and chronic inflammation. Herein, we develop a cationic molecular scavenger through a screening of cationic dendronized polymers, which could eliminate the cfDNA and inhibit the TLR recognition and nucleic acid-induced inflammation. The structure-property study demonstrates that toxicity, NA binding capacity and biodistribution could be balanced to achieve maximum therapeutic effect with exquisite control of molecular structure. In addition, the optimized cationic polymer effectively inhibited the joint swelling, synovial hyperplasia and bone destruction in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model. The results supported that the synthetic polymers offer new paradigm for autoimmune disease treatment.",

        "abstract": "The evolution of multiple shear bands in a Zr-based metallic glass under multiaxial loading was systematically investigated by the small punch test. Unlike the fast propagation of the individual shear band and catastrophic failure of the metallic glass under uniaxial tensile or compressive loading, the metallic glass can be controlled to create regularly arrayed fine multiple shear bands under multiaxial loading. The distribution of the shear bands displayed a cobweb-like pattern along radial and circumferential directions. A large equivalent plastic strain (19.6%) was achieved in the metallic glass under multiaxial loading, which was far higher than that gained under uniaxial compressive loading. The multiaxial loading method was also applied to evaluate the mechanical properties of the annealed Zr-based metallic glass. Three types of failure modes were observed in the as-cast or annealed specimens: circumferential and radial shear failure, and radial normal (cleavage) failure. In contrast with uniaxial tension and compression, the multiaxial loading by small punch test was found to be very suitable for the evaluation of the mechanical properties of metallic glasses and, further, to distinguish the transition from ductility to brittleness more accurately.",

However, it remains a challenge to controllably grow FLG with vertical and parallel orientations. We intentionally designed the substrate surface structure to manipulate the distribution of the plasma sheath and induce the direction of the built-in electric field to guide the growth direction of the FLG in two dimensions. The effects of the plasma sheath and the built-in field on the FLG growth are discussed. The electrical and field emission characteristics of single sheet FLG with parallel and random types were measured, and they demonstrate similar and good characteristics. This method provides a way to controllably grow parallel and vertical FLG arrays. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "Conversion of carbon nanotubes to diamond by spark plasma sintering",
        "abstract": "The diamond phase has been converted directly from carbon nanotubes by spark plasma sintering (SPS), at 1500 °C under 80 MPa pressure, without any catalyst being involved. Well-crystallized diamond crystals, with particle sizes ranging from 300 nm to 10 μm were obtained. After sintering at 1200 °C, the tips of the carbon nanotubes were found to be open and the conversion from carbon nanotubes to diamond started. The mechanism for carbon nanotube to diamond conversion in SPS may be described as that from carbon nanotubes to an intermediate phase of carbon nano-onion, and then to diamond. It is believed that the plasmas generated by the low-voltage, vacuum spark, via a pulsed DC in the SPS process, played a critical role in the low pressure diamond formation. This SPS process provides an alternative approach to diamond synthesis. Keywords Carbon nanotube, Carbon onions, Diamond Sintering Phase transitions 1 Introduction Carbon is the most versatile element that can be bonded in many ways to construct new structures, such as graphite, diamond, C 60 and carbon nanotubes. The phase transformations amongst these forms are an interesting subject to study. In particular, the formation of diamond, a valuable engineering material, is of great importance. Graphite changes to diamond at high temperature and high pressures. Fullerenes (C 60 ) have been converted to diamond by applying solely high pressures [1] , applying only high temperature [2] and other conditions [3] . Also, carbon nanotubes have been transferred to diamond. Wei et al. first demonstrated the diamond formation via laser ablation of carbon nanotubes deposited on a steel substrate, at one atmosphere pressure [4] , or by applying pressures of 5 GPa, at 1500 °C [5] . Different hydraulic static pressures of 4–20 GPa [6–9] , as well as dynamic shock pressures up to 25 GPa [10] , were also employed to grow diamond from carbon nanotubes at various temperatures. Spark plasma sintering (SPS) is an advanced technique for the synthesis of novel ceramic or cermet materials. In this paper, we describe the direct growth of diamond from carbon nanotubes at 80 MPa by using the SPS technique. The possible mechanism for diamond formation is discussed. 2 Experimental Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MCNTs), 20–50 nm in diameter and up to several tens of μm in length, were produced by a standard catalytic chemical vapor deposition (Shenzhen Nanotech. Port. Company Ltd., China). After the metal catalysts and the accompanying amorphous carbon particles were removed, the nanotubes were pressed into a graphite die for SPS treatment to form disk-shaped samples of 20 mm diameter and 5 mm thickness. SPS experiments were conducted using a Dr. Sinter ® system (Model SPS-1050, Sumitomo Coal Mining Co. Japan), under an axial pressure of 80 MPa in a vacuum. Different temperatures were utilized and monitored by an optical pyrometer through a window in the graphite die. A heating rate of 100 K/min was adopted, and the sintering process lasted typically 20 min. The applied direct current for SPS was about 1000 A (voltage < 5 V), with a pulse duration of 12 ms and an interval of 2 ms. The resulting disk-shaped samples were fabricated and then immersed in a solution of concentrated H 2 SO 4 (90 vol.%) and HNO 3 (10 vol.%) for 5 h. The etched samples were first washed using water, then acetone, and dried in a vacuum oven. A field emission gun scanning electron microscope (SEM, HITACHI-S4700) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-1200 EX and Philips EM-430, operating at 120 kV and 300 kV, respectively) were employed to characterize the starting materials and the products following SPS treatment. Further characterization was performed with a Renishaw-2000 Laser Raman spectroscopy system. A He–Ne laser excited at 632.8 nm was used with a power density of 4.7 mW and a spot diameter of 5 μm. 3 Results and discussion The typical morphology of the carbon nanotube starting materials is shown in Fig. 1 . They are seen to exhibit an external and internal diameter of ca. 35 nm and 10 nm, respectively; 300 nm–50 μm long. No other forms of carbon and metal catalysts were identified during TEM observations. The carbon nanotubes also show a very flexible feature in that they appear entangled with each other. For the sample sintered at 1200 °C, it was found that most of the carbon nanotubes were shortened, compared with the starting materials, and some of their tips were open. Such an open-tipped carbon nanotube is shown in Fig. 2 . Figs. 3 (a–d) are SEM images of the samples following SPS treatment. At 1200 °C, some nanotubes appear to be melting and clustering ( Fig. 3 a). At 1500 °C, large diamond particles were observed among the unconverted CNTs, ranging from 300 nm to 10 μm ( Figs. 3 b–d). By comparing the Raman spectra of the starting materials with those sintered at 1200 °C, 1500 °C and 1700 °C, respectively, it was found that the characteristic Raman shift of the cubic diamond phase appeared at 1332 cm −1 or 1333 cm −1 . These results show that the D band (left) shifted from the original 1320 cm −1 ( Fig. 4 a, corresponding to multi-walled carbon nanotubes) to 1332 cm −1 at 1500 °C ( Fig. 4 c), confirming that the crystals in Fig. 3 are indeed diamond phase. The D band in Fig. 4 b appears at 1330 cm −1 , very close to 1332 cm −1 , indicating that nanotubes in Fig. 3 a are just about to initiate the conversion to diamond. The G band (right) is due to the E 2g mode of graphite band (G band) [11] , relating to the sp 2 bonded carbon vibrations in a 2-dimensional graphitic hexagonal lattice. It also shifts from 1575 cm −1 ( Fig. 4 a) to 1583 cm −1 ( Fig. 4 b) and then to 1587 cm −1 ( Fig. 4 c), which implies that besides the diamond formation, graphite phase may also form from the carbon nanotubes sintered at 1500 °C. Nevertheless, these Raman results agree well with the SEM observations ( Fig. 3 ) that diamonds are partly transformed only from the carbon nanotubes. The Raman spectrum of the 1700 °C sintered samples ( Fig. 4 d) is almost identical to that from the sample sintered at 1500 °C, except that small shifts occurred at 1333 cm −1 and 1585 cm −1 , indicating possible internal crystalline defect densities of the different products. In comparison with other processes for diamond synthesis using carbon nanotubes, which generally involve pressures at a level of several GPa, the fact that only 80 MPa pressure was applied in this study is of significant interest. In light of applied pressure and temperature, SPS is similar to the standard hot pressing (HP) which is a widely used industrial procedure for materials processing. The unique feature for the SPS process, however, lies in the usage of an on–off pulsed direct current, as shown in Fig. 5 . Multi-walled carbon nanotubes are reported to be dynamically stable at a temperature as high as 2700 K in a non-oxygen atmosphere during HP [12] . Thus, such a significant difference in the products must be due to the special sintering principle of SPS, which is a field activated sintering technique based on an electric spark discharge phenomenon [13] , i.e. a high energy and low voltage spark pulse current ( Fig. 5 ) momentarily generating a sparking plasma which causes localized high temperatures. We believe that the spark plasma contributes to the diamond conversion from carbon nanotubes during the SPS. Despite the on-going argument about whether the spark plasmas actually occur during the SPS process, our present study, generating diamond under such a low pressure, suggests that such sparking plasmas indeed took place during SPS, and they dramatically reduced the pressures required for diamond formation from the GPa to the MPa level. Because the SPS process was originally designed for fast, routine processing of materials, it may provide a new way for diamond synthesis on a large scale. Further TEM examination of the resulting materials after grinding revealed that the hollow cylindrical structures of nanotubes collapsed or disappeared in some cases, but hollow quasi-spherical onion-like structures formed ( Fig. 6 ). Samples sintered at 1500 °C and 1700 °C displayed identical morphological features. It is believed that a carbon nano-onion consists of nanoscopic pressure cells, which promote diamond formation under intense electron or ion beam irradiation [14] . Furthermore, a mechanism whereby carbon nanotubes break into nano-onions then to diamond has been established previously [5] . Similar intermediate phases have also been reported at the much higher pressures which were involved for diamond growth [8,15] . Our HRTEM observations, Fig. 6 , reveal that such intermediate onion-like structures indeed occurred. We believe that the effect of our high temperatures and sparking plasmas is akin to the electron or ion beam irradiations or high pressures. As a result, diamond results from the intermediate nano-onions when localized high energy conditions are satisfied. 4 Conclusions By applying an SPS technique, diamond phase was directly produced from MWCNTs at 80 MPa and 1500 °C, without any catalyst being involved. Our study shows that the nanotube-to-diamond conversion starts at 1200 °C and well-crystallized large diamond crystals are obtained at 1500 °C. The unique sintering principle of SPS appears to play a key role in the diamond growth and an intermediate phase, nano-onions, is essential for conversion to diamond. Due to the versatile nature of SPS, this technique may be important for large scale diamond synthesis.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduced an improved way to control the microstructure of the colloids via co-gelation of binary sols with different concentrations method (CBS). The approach was developed to maintain typical silica particles derived two target density single-sols, and these typical silica particles with distinct diameters (large: 10-12. nm; small: 3-5. nm) were interconnected into a special skeletal framework and internal structure for silica aerogels. BET observation, SEM analysis, and TEM study indicate differences in pore size distributions and surface morphology for aerogels prepared by conventional (single-sol) and CBS (mixed-sol) chemistry approaches. Hence, the CBS method can enable us to obtain mixed aerogels with excellent performance in various physical properties, DMA and UV-vis results suggest that better mechanical property and higher optical transmittance are dominated by the special nanostructure rather than by some unique properties of silica aerogels. Effective hydrothermal treatment technique was used to shorten gelling time significantly and promote silica particles to grow freely during the sol-gel reaction process. These results have important implications for designing novel structure of porous materials and for understanding observations of high performance for silica aerogels. © 2013.",

For all such potential devices, controlling the size, morphology, and interparticle spacing of the nanoparticles is very important. Here, we combine seed-mediated growth with nanosphere lithography to study the controllable growth of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), in which the self-assembly monolayer of polystyrene (PS) on a silicon surface is used to guide the modification of alkanesilanes and the subsequent adsorption of gold seeds; seed-mediated growth is applied to controlling the morphology and size of Au NPs. The size of adsorption region (determining the number of adsorbed gold seeds) is controlled by etching PS microspheres with oxygen plasma or annealing PS microspheres at the glass transition temperature. The size and morphology of the Au NPs are controlled by changing growth conditions. In such a way, we have achieved the dual control of the obtained Au NPs. Preliminary results show that this strategy holds a great promise. This approach can also be extended to a wide range of materials and substrates. © 2006 Chin. Phys. Soc. and IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the characteristics of 1HMRSI and its diagnostic value on meningioma.The findings of conventional MRI and of 1HMRSI from 11 cases of clinically proven meningiomas and from 12 normal volunteers were comparatively analyzed. The imaging sequences included T1-weighted imaging and T2-weighted imaging; additionally T1-weighted imaging with injection of the contrast agent of Gd-DTPA was performed in all meningioma cases. Two-dimensional phase encoding of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (2D 1HMRSI) were obtained in all cases.On conventional pre-contrast MRI, the signals in 8 meningioma cases showed medium or faintly low intensities and in 3 cases showed mixed intensities on T1WI. On T2WI, the signals in 7 cases showed medium or faintly high intensities and in 4 cases showed mixed intensities. After injection of Gd-DTPA, the solid portion of tumors exhibited obvious enhancement in all meningioma cases. \"Dural trail sign\" was revealed in 7 cases. Peri-tumor edema was evident in 11 meningioma cases. Compared with control group, 1HMRSI of all meningiomas revealed different spectral peaks, including absent acetylaspartate (NAA), prominent choline (Cho), and reduced phosphocreatine (Pcr). The ratios of Cho/Pcr obviously increased. The peak of lactate (Lac) was visualized in 2 meningioma cases.Most cases of meningioma can be diagnosed with conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 1HMRSI can yield more informative findings about meningioma via the observed metabolic materials changes in tumor cells. So conventional MRI is the most important technology for diagnosing meningioma and 1HMRS combined with MRI can improve the diagnostic accuracy. 1HMRSI can be an important supplemental means in the diagnosis of meningiomas.",

The lithium ion capacity and cycle ability of the composites were investigated by galvanostatic discharge-charge cycling. The results showed that the nanocomposite had the higher capacity, about 384.0 mAh/g in the first discharge process and 256.3 mAh/g in the second discharge cycle. The charge-transfer reaction at the electrode/electrolyte interface and the kinetic mechanism were too studied by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.",

Freckles were usually observed on the specimen surface within a range of 2–15 mm above the platform, and the freckles on both sides were slanted to respective edge. The freckling number was reduced with increasing withdrawal rate. Combining with the simulation, freckle formation was analysed. The deceleration of dendrites growth above the platform caused by the abrupt variation in cross section leads to an increase in the tendency of the fact that the interdendritic fluid-flow velocity is larger than the growth rate, and thus increasing the freckling tendency. The pressure difference in the horizontal direction induced by the concaved solidification interface forces the interdendritic segregated melt to flow toward the surfaces and edges, and slants the freckles. The freckle formation can be suppressed with increasing withdrawal rate for the refined dendrite microstructure.",

        "abstract": "Chlorine is a major fuel contaminant when by-product hydrogen from the chlor-alkali industry is used as the fuel for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Understanding the effects of chlorine contamination on fuel cell performance and durability is essential to address fuel cell applications for the automotive and stationary markets. This paper reports our findings of chloride contamination effects on PEM fuel cell performance and durability, as our first step in understanding the effects of chlorine contamination. Fuel cell contamination tests were conducted by injecting ppm levels of contaminant into the fuel cell from either the fuel stream or the air stream. In situ and ex situ diagnosis were performed to investigate the contamination mechanisms. The results show that cell voltage during chloride contamination is characterized by an initial sudden drop followed by a plateau, regardless of which side the contaminant is introduced into the fuel cell. The drop in cell performance is predominantly due to increased cathode charge transfer resistance as a result of electrochemical catalyst surface area (ECSA) loss attributable to the blocking of active sites by Cl − and enhanced Pt dissolution.",

OS and TTR were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test.Peritumoral NRP-1 and VEGFR-2 expression were significantly higher than that of the tumoral tissue (p < 0.001 for both), and high peritumoral expression of both factors was negatively associated with tumor size (p < 0.001 for both). Patients with high peritumoral expression of both proteins had the longest median OS (>94.0 months) and TTR (>84.0 months). The multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that patients with high peritumoral expression of both NRP-1 and VEGFR-2 were more than 4 times less likely to have recurrence (p = 0.004) and more than 10 times likely to survive (p < 0.001).Peritumoral NRP-1 and VEGFR-2 expression is associated with prolonged TTR and extended OS of HCC patients and both may be useful as predictors of surgical outcome of HCC patients and explored as potential therapeutic targets.",

        "abstract": "SLAs play an important role for the QoS-driven service composition. Meanwhile, the temporal constraints are one of the main elements in the management of SLA especially in specifying the validity period of the QoS offers. In practice, the temporal constraints should be generated dynamically by taking the resource capability of the provider into account. The generation should consider various parameters that influence the resource capability such as the expected duration of the required Web service, the amount of current utilization, the amount of available resources, the number of required time slots, etc. Therefore, this paper aims to elaborate this issue and present a temporal constraints formation for SLA negotiation framework. This framework is proposed in the context of service selection and SLA negotiation. It provides the foundation towards the dynamic formation. This paper also demonstrates the initial approach of temporal constraints formation.",

After shear pre-deformation, the variations in the mechanical properties and the free volume content were examined by recourse to differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Vickers hardness measurements and uniaxial compression tests. The plastic strain prior to failure of the pre-deformed samples first increases and then decreases with increasing prior plastic strain. The hardness values of the pre-deformed samples exhibit an opposite trend. The variations in the mechanical performance for the pre-deformed samples were ascribed to the variation in free volume content associated with the competition between the annihilation process by diffusion atomic jumping and the stress-driven free volume creation.",

        "abstract": "As a potential target for shock wave experiments, the multilayer graded density carbon aerogel target was prepared. Firstly, carbon aerogel sheets with varying thickness and density were fabricated by polycondensation of resorcinol with formaldehyde by a self-made flexible micro-mould. Secondly, with ultra-low density (10 mg cm-3) SiO2 aerogel as a bonding agent, a 5-layer graded density carbon aerogel target was obtained. The thickness of each unit sheet ranged from 100 to 580 μm, and the density ranged from 50 to 400 mg cm-3 . We focused on fabrication of unit sheets, peeling off their dense layers (about 150 nm) and research of C/SiO2 aerogel interface microstructure. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray phase contrast imager and surface profiler were used to observe the multilayer structure and characterize the surface and internal microstructure of unit sheets. The results showed that the target fabricated by such method possessed multilayer graded density structure with homogeneous C/SiO2 interface and excellent formability. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Structural characterization by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction indicates that both the face-centered cubic spinel ZTO subsection and the wurtzite ZnS subsection of the heterostructure are well crystallized with a distinct interface along the heterostructure axial direction. Based on detailed analysis of the growth process of biaxial ZnS/ZTO nanowire heterostructures, there are two dominating stages: a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) controlled growth of ZTO sub-nanowire and a self-assembly growth of ZnS sub-nanowire onto the preformed ZTO base nanowire. A growth model of the heterostructures is proposed. The presented method would be flexible and feasible for the synthesis of other nano-heterostructures with non-oxide/oxide interface to meet the growing demands of nanoscale science and technology. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "The predominant results of the project \"Active fault detecting and seismic risk assessment in Urumqi City\" are introduced in this paper. The active faults detecting target region covers the Urumqi City and its urban planning area. Deep seismogenic tectonics of the faults was detected systematically during this project. The seismic risk and damage of the active faults were estimated preliminarily. Two groups of Holocene active faults, namely, Wangjiagou Fault group and Jiujiawan Fault group, were identified in the target region. The Wangjiagou Fault group is composed of four north-dipping thrust faults, while the Jiujiawan Fault group is composed of four north-dipping normal faults. Four late Pleistocene active faults, namely, Bagang-Shihua buried fault, Xishan Fault, Wanyaogou Fault and Bayangnangou Fault, were detected in the target region. A clear image of the thin-skinned thrust system under the city was made by deep seismic profile carried out by this project. Combined with the observation of mobile seismic station array and precise location of micro quakes in the target region, as well as other deep structure detecting results, such as the petroleum seismic profile, two seismic models of the target region were established. The seismic risk of the Holocene active faults and late Pleistocene active fault were estimated by paleo-earthquake trenching and seismicity analysis along the Holocene active faults, as well as the microstructure study along the late Pleistocene active faults. Meanwhile, the strong ground motion generated by potential strong earthquakes directly under the target region was predicted by numerical modeling. The surface displacement and deformation zones of the future strong earthquake along the Holocene and late Pleistocene active faults were estimated.",

Thirty-six rabbits with acute sciatic nerve traction injury randomly received 1 × 10(6) labeled (n = 12) or unlabeled MSCs (n = 12) or vehicle alone injection. The distribution and migration of implanted cells was followed by MRI and correlated with histology. The relative signal intensity (RSL) of the grafts was measured.The labeling efficiency was 76 ± 4.7% and the labeling procedure did not inﬂuence cell viability, proliferation, and apoptosis. A persistent higher RSL in grafts was found in the labeled group compared with the unlabeled and vehicle groups until 10 days after transplantation (P < 0.05). The distribution and migration of labeled cells could be tracked by MRI until 10 days after transplantation. Transplanted MSCs were not found to transdifferentiate into Schwann-like cells within 14-day follow-up.Labeling MSCs with the dual agents may enable cellular MRI of the engraftment in the experimental peripheral nerve injury.",

        "abstract": "A new initiating phenomenon of peritectic coupled growth was observed in directionally solidified Fe-Ni alloys under diffusion-limited growth condition. Although it is generally accepted that peritectic coupled growth is initiated by island banding, the present experimental results show that two phases coupled growth could also be initiated by planar primary phase in samples of different compositions. Two models were proposed to explain the new initiating mechanism of peritectic coupled growth. It was found that due to the solute pile-up at the planar primary phase interface, the liquid at the planar primary phase interface will be suitable for nucleation of the peritectic phase or constitutionally undercooled with respect to the growing primary phase. The simultaneous growth of the nucleated peritectic phase with the primary phase or the cellular primary phases with the intercellular peritectic phase can induce the formation of coupled growth. © 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "As a promising electromagnetic process to obtain TiAl samples without contamination, electromagnetic confinement and directional solidification was successfully applied for lamellar microstructure control in Ti-47Al alloy. Seeded by a Ti-43Al-3Si seed, columnar  grains grew stably and the lamellae within these grains were aligned parallel to the growth direction. However, stray  or  grains, in which the lamellae were complex, nucleated and grew in the sample edge. The possible reasons for the formation of stray grains were discussed by analyzing the temperature gradient at the solid/liquid interface and the macrosegregation of TiSi particles and Al solute along the sample radius. Moreover, the fluid flow induced by electromagnetic force, which led to the macrosegregation, was also discussed by using a simple model.",

With the substitution of Cu for Ni, the Ho magnetic moment will cant from the c-axis, and form a complicated magnetic structure. These compounds exhibit two successive magnetic transitions with the increase in temperature. The large reversible magnetocaloric effects have been observed in HoNi 1-xCuxIn compounds around Tord, with no thermal and magnetic hysteresis loss. The large reversible isothermal magnetic entropy change (-��SM) is 20.2 J/kg K and the refrigeration capacity (RC) reaches 356.7 J/kg for field changes of 5 T for HoNi0.7Cu 0.3In. Especially, the value of -��SM (12.5 J/kg K) and the large RC (132 J/kg) are observed for field changes of 2 T for HoNi 0.9Cu0.1In. Additionally, the values of RC are improved to 149 J/K for the field changes of 2 T due to a wide temperature span for the mix of HoNi0.9Cu0.1In and HoNi0.7Cu 0.3In compounds with the mass ratio of 1:1. These compounds with excellent MCE are expected to have effective applications in magnetic refrigeration around 20 K. ? 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.",

Due to their high surface area, electrically conducting network, and chemical inertness, carbon aerogels can be considered ideal electrodes in rechargeable batteries. In this article, nanocomposite carbon anodes were prepared using carbon aerogels powders and graphite powders and the compound powders and binder, separately. With different carbon anodes and with lithium metal foil as the cathode, half-cells were made. Electrochemical measurements of the lithium intercalation properties for carbon aerogels were performed under high-purity argon in a glove box. The model cells showed that the initial charge capacity is 1135 mAh/g, and nanocomposite carbon anodes revealed better properties. This was due to the carbon aerogels' electrically conducting network in order to provide good access of Li+ ions and electrons to active material. © The Author(s) 2011.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this paper, the (vapour + liquid) phase equilibrium for the (isobutane + cis-1,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene) system was measured by the static-analytical method at six temperatures from (303.150 to 353.150) K. The combined standard uncertainties of the temperature, pressure and composition were less than ±5 mK, ±0.0005 MPa and ±0.005, respectively. The experimental results were correlated by means of the Peng–Robison (PR) equation of state (EoS) with Van der Waals (VDW) mixing rule and Huron–Vidal (HV) mixing rule involving the non-random two-liquid (NRTL) activity coefficient model. Good consistency is found by both models. The average absolute relative deviations of pressure are between 0.44% and 0.58% for the PR-VDW model, while the average absolute relative deviations of pressure are between 0.12% and 0.44% for the PR-HV-NRTL model. The average absolute deviations of vapour phase mole fraction lay between 0.007 and 0.008 for the PR-VDW model, while the average absolute deviations of vapour phase mole fraction lay between 0.004 and 0.008 for the PR-HV-NRTL model. The results show that the PR-HV-NRTL model has better performance than that of the PR-VDW model for the binary system. Obviously an azeotropic behaviour can be observed for the system.",

A composite microstructure with highly uniformly distributed and well-developed crystalline dendrites was successfully prepared by casting the Zr 65 (Cu 0.4 Al 0.3 Ni 0.3 ) 28 Nb 7 melt into a copper mold. The addition of Nb element results in the significant narrowing of supercooled liquid region. Furthermore, the addition of Nb element leads to an increased disorder in atomic structure of the alloy and hence increases the thermal stability of the alloy.",

        "abstract": "Background:Herba Rhodiolae is a traditional Chinese medicine used by the Tibetan people for treating hypoxia related diseases such as anxiety. Based on the previous work, we developed and patented an anti-anxiety herbal formula Fu Fang Jin Jing Oral Liquid (FJJOL) with Herba Rhodiolae as a chief ingredient. In this study, the anti-hypoxia and anti-anxiety effects of FJJOL in a high altitude forced-swimming mouse model with anxiety symptoms will be elucidated by NMR-based metabolomics.Methods:In our experiments, the mice were divided randomly into four groups as flatland group, high altitude saline-treated group, high altitude FJJOL-treated group, and high altitude diazepam-treated group. To cause anxiety effects and hypoxic defects, a combination use of oxygen level decreasing (hypobaric cabin) and oxygen consumption increasing (exhaustive swimming) were applied to mice. After a three-day experimental handling, aqueous metabolites of mouse brain tissues were extracted and then subjected to NMR analysis. The therapeutic effects of FJJOL on the hypobaric hypoxia mice with anxiety symptoms were verified.Results:Upon hypoxic exposure, both energy metabolism defects and disorders of functional metabolites in brain tissues of mice were observed. PCA, PLS-DA and OPLS-DA scatter plots revealed a clear group clustering for metabolic profiles in the hypoxia versus normoxia samples. After a three-day treatment with FJJOL, significant rescue effects on energy metabolism were detected, and levels of ATP, fumarate, malate and lactate in brain tissues of hypoxic mice recovered. Meanwhile, FJJOL also up-regulated the neurotransmitter GABA, and the improvement of anxiety symptoms was highly related to this effect.Conclusions:FJJOL ameliorated hypobaric hypoxia effects by regulating energy metabolism, choline metabolism, and improving the symptoms of anxiety. The anti-anxiety therapeutic effects of FJJOL were comparable to the conventional anti-anxiety drug diazepam on the hypobaric hypoxia mice. FJJOL might serve as an alternative therapy for the hypoxia and anxiety disorders. © 2013 Liu et al.",

In this study, nanocrystalline WC–10Co–0.8VC–0.2Cr 3 C 2 (wt.%) composite powders, whose average grain size is bout 25 nm, were fabricated by a unique ball milling technique with variable rotation rate and repetitious circulation in 32 min. The high energy ball milling process was optimized and the as-prepared nanocrystalline powders were characterized and analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). Furthermore, a low temperature, high heating rate, short soaking time and pressure sintering technique, that is, rapid hot pressing sintering, was used in the sintering process, by which nanostructured WC–Co cemented carbides with mean grain size of 250 nm were produced. The material exhibits high hardness of 93.6 HRA and transverse rapture strength of 2746 MPa. In the sintered composites, the distribution of elements W, Co, V and Cr is homogeneous, and it is small quantity of miropores and extraordinary coarse tungsten carbide phase that negatively influence the transverse rapture strength of nanostructured WC–Co cemented carbides.",

        "abstract": "Arrays of vacuum microelectronic sources are fabricated on a glass substrate using cupric oxide (CuO) nanowire emitters. The\n arrays of electron sources possess a microdiode structure, which can effectively induce field emission and control the delivery\n of emitted electrons to the anode in a triode-type device operation. A technique for precisely growing CuO nanowires at the\n centre of microcavities in an array without using a catalyst and at temperatures as low as 400°C is presented. Such a simplified\n fabrication procedure results in improved field emission performance from the array compared with previous vacuum microelectronic\n devices. Typical prototype devices have turn-on gate voltages as low as 169 V to give emission current densities of 10 μA/cm2 at the anode. The ratio of anode current to cathode current reaches ∼0.85, and the maximum change in emission current density\n per volt is 1 μA/cm2. Electron emission from the arrays is stable and reproducible under either pulsed or direct current fields. These characteristics\n indicate that microgate-controlled CuO nanowire emitters may find application in practical devices.",

        "abstract": "In this work, methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) derived silica aerogel with the low density of about 38 mg/cm3 was prepared via ethanol supercritical fluid drying. Nondestructive dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) was successfully used to characterize its mechanical behavior in the temperature range − 150–300 °C. The DMA results reveal that the storage modulus of low density aerogel is under 0.25 MPa and keep almost constant over a broad temperature range − 150–300 °C, while the storage modulus of high density aerogel (247 mg/cm3) is beyond 2.5 MPa and change noticeably in the same temperature range. The MTMS-derived low density silica aerogel have not only excellent stable mechanical property, but also low thermal conductivity (0.02591 W/mK) and super-hydrophobicity (contact angle 160°), which results in the potential application for the space exploration.",

Herein, we report a featured method by utilizing the non-uniaxial tangential tension stress (σT) at the Si surface of a vertical hyperbolic Si/SiO2 core-shell nanostructure during thermal oxidation for achieving well-defined Si nano-constrictions. A thermal oxidation model was proposed to describe the correlations between the σT and the structural parameters of the hyperbolic nanostructure, i.e., oxide thickness (tox), sidewall curvature radius (R0) and neck-diameter (2rA0). Numerical simulations indicated that the Si surface at the position with the narrowest diameter (neck-position) stands the highest σT (~ GPa) and presented a gradient distribution to both the ends. By means of stress regulation follow the model, array of well-defined Si nano-constriction with ~10 nm in diameter and ~34 nm in length was obtained. The experimental findings demonstrated that the high σT would induce a nano-fracture and thus possessed a local oxidation to form a nano-constriction, self-aligned at the neck-position. The finding well extends the capability of stress-assisted \"nanofabrication\" of Si via thermal oxidation.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we reported the experimental results about the effect of the thermal treatment on microstructure and physical properties of low-density and high transparent silica aerogels. From our results, with tetramethyl orthosilicate as precursor and via acetonitrile supercritical drying process, silica aerogel monolith was obtained possessing the properties as low-density (0.018 g/cm3), high surface area (923 m2/g), high optical transparency (87.9 %, 800 nm). It should be noted that high transparency of silica aerogel can be maintained up to 600 C (91.5 %, 800 nm). The mechanical properties of silica aerogel decreased with increasing heat treated temperature to 600 C, and silica aerogels still maintained crack-free monoliths completely and possessed high homogeneous density even after 600 C thermal treatment. Furthermore, thermal conductivity of the monoliths at desired temperatures was analyzed by the transient plane heat source method. When the temperature flowed from 25 to 600 C, thermal conductivity coefficients of silica aerogels changed from 0.021 to 0.065 W (m K)-1, revealed an excellent heat insulation effect in high-temperature area. Currently, the specific process developed for low-density aerogels affected by thermal treatment has not been reported in previous literature. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

        "abstract": "As the final life-saving treatment option for patients with terminal organ failure, organ transplantation is far from an ideal solution. The concomitant allograft rejection, which is hardly detectable especially in the early acute rejection (AR) period characterized by an intense cellular and humoral attack on donor tissue, greatly affects the graft survival and results in rapid graft loss. Based on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-visible and T-cell-targeted multifunctional polymeric nanocarrier developed in our lab, effective co-delivery of pDNA and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles into primary T cells expressing CD3 molecular biomarker was confirmed in vitro. In the heart transplanted rat model, this multifunctional nanocarrier showed not only a high efficiency in detecting post-transplantation acute rejection but also a great ability to mediate gene transfection in T cells. Upon intravenous injection of this MRI-visible polyplex of nanocarrier and pDNA, T-cell gathering was detected at the endocardium of the transplanted heart as linear strongly hypointense areas on the MRI T(2)*-weighted images on the third day after cardiac transplantation. Systematic histological and molecular biology studies demonstrated that the immune response in heart transplanted rats was significantly suppressed upon gene therapy using the polyplex bearing the DGKα gene. More excitingly, the therapeutic efficacy was readily monitored by noninvasive MRI during the treatment process. Our results revealed the great potential of the multifunctional nanocarrier as a highly effective imaging tool for real-time and noninvasive monitoring and a powerful nanomedicine platform for gene therapy of AR with high efficiency.",

The variation in mechanical performance of the glassy spheres of different sizes is interpreted within the framework of free volume theory. © 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "PEM fuel cells are increasingly designed to operate at high current densities. At these densities, mass transport limitations become very significant, but they are not well understood, with many modeling studies but few experimental observations. The use of accurate transport coefficients to simulate the mass transport at high current densities is crucial. In this study, experimental measurements have been carried out to determine the effective diffusion coefficient in the carbon paper gas diffusion layer that is commonly used in PEM fuel cells. It was found that almost all the existing theoretical models significantly overpredict the effective diffusion coefficient by as much as 4–5 times; thus, underestimating the transport limitations considerably. Further, the effects of temperature, Teflon treatment for hydrophobicity and porosity on the effective diffusion coefficient were investigated. It was found that temperature does not affect the overall diffusibility of the gas. The diffusibility is decreased with the increase of Teflon treatment and decrease in porosity. Further work on better understanding the diffusion process in the gas diffusion layer is under way.",

In order to reduce the number of adjustable parameters from three to two, this work aims to establish an adequate expression for alpha in terms of readily available molecular parameters. The regressed alpha coefficients vary from -1 to 10, while 74% of them are between 0 and 1. Alpha has a great effect on the AARD p , although there is a region with a small AARD p  difference. The relationship between alpha and molecular weight, dipole moment is established. As expected, positive correlation between alpha and molecular weight, while negative correlation between alpha and dipole is found. Better AARD p  (0.59%) is achieved by a proposed equation, comparing to alpha = (0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.47), although it is slightly worse than the regressed alpha.",

        "abstract": "It is very important to diagnose the radiation injury in brain stem and cervical spinal cord of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after radiotherapy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) manifestations of radiation encephalopathy have been widely reported, while those of radiation injury in brain stem and cervical spinal cord have been seldom reported. This study was to analyze the MRI characteristics of radiation injury in brain stem and cervical spinal cord of patients with NPC after radiotherapy.MRI was performed in 60 NPC patients 6 months to 5 years after radiotherapy. The imaging sequences included T(1)-weighted image (T(1)WI), T2-weighted image (T(2)WI), fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). All patients received T(1)WI contrast-enhanced scanning.Of the 60 patients, 6 had lesions in cervical spinal cord, 54 had lesions in brain stem. Of the 54 cases of radiation injury in brain stem, most lesions located in pons (20 cases), basis pons and medulla oblongata (26 cases), others located in mesencephalon (3 cases), medulla oblongata (5 cases). All lesions showed hypo- or iso-intense signal on T(1)WI, and hyper-intense signal on T(2)WI. After contrast-enhanced scanning, 11 cases (18.3%) had no enhancement; 49 (81.7%) markedly enhanced with 21 cases (42.9%) of homogenous patchy enhancement, and 28 cases (57.1%) of hetergenerous ringed and patchy enhancement.MRI shows clearly the radiation injury in brain stem and cervical spinal cord of NPC patients after radiotherapy.",

        "abstract": "As a critical facility, spiral-wound heat exchanger (SWHE) has been widely used in many industrial applications. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was employed with the smallest periodic element and periodic boundary conditions to examine the characteristics of the shell side of SWHE. Numerical simulation results show that the heat transfer coefficients around the tube initially increase and subsequently decrease with radial angle because of the influence of backflow and turbulent separation. The mean absolute deviation between simulated heat transfer coefficients and measured values for methane, ethane, nitrogen and a mixture (methane/ethane) is within 5% when Reynolds number is over 30000. For the pressure drop, the simulated values are smaller than the measured values, and the mean absolute deviation is within 9%. Numerical simulation results also indicate that the pressure drop and heat transfer coefficients on the shell side of SWHE decrease as the winding angle of the tubes increases. Considering the effect of winding angle on pressure drops and heat transfer coefficients, the modified correlations of Nusselt number Nu = 0.308Re0.64Pr0.36(1 + sinθ)-1.38 and friction factor f = 0.435Re-0.133(sinθ)-0.36, are proposed. Comparing with the experimental data, the maximum deviations for heat transfer coefficients and pressure drops are less than 5% and 11% respectively.",

        "abstract": "Plenty of well data and 2D seismic data obtained from the shallow-water shelf region were used to identify six tertiary sequences from 21 million to 10.5 million years before present with the sequence stratigraphic analysis. The deep-water fans were figured out in corresponding lowstand system tracts. The deep-water fan of every sequence was overlapped in Baiyun Depression. Micropaleontologic quantitative analysis for 60 exploration wells demonstrated that there were six times of tertiary sea level change from 21 million to 10.5 million years before present, which is consistent with the regulation of global tertiary sea level change. Periodic sea level falling, abundant sediment supply from the Paleo-Pearl River and long-term thermal subsidence of Baiyun Depression in Pearl River Mouth Basin resulted in the slope deep-water environment, which is the key factor for development of deep- water fan system of the Pearl River in the South China Sea. The deep-water slope deposition system in the northern South China Sea is similar to the deep-water deposition systems in the Atlantic deep-water petroleum exploration hotspots. They are both located in the passive continental margin and own long-term thermal subsidence and abundant supply from large paleo-river. Recent discovery of a large natural gas field in the northern slope of Baiyun Depression demonstrates its great resource potential in the huge lacustrine source kitchen in the Eogene of Baiyun Depression. The multi-period deep-water fans vertically superposed on the source rock will become the key fields for petroleum exploration.",

The TiN/WN superlattice has an in-plane Cauchy pressure as high as 296 GPa, which is 348% larger than that in Ti 0.5 W 0.5 N solid solutions. Supertoughness is also significantly affected by the coupling between macro- and micro-distortions in addition to previously reported valence electron concentration and atomic ordering effects. Present results indicate a route to develop superhard and supertough superlattice coatings.",

According to the hyperbolic expression of ΔCp, novel expressions of the Gibbs free energy difference, ΔG, enthalpy difference, ΔH, and entropy difference, ΔS, between the supercooled liquid and corresponding crystalline phase may be estimated. The experimentally measured thermodynamic parameters of Ti 35.37Cu45.11Ni8.88Zr10.64 and Ti37.65Cu43.25Ni9.6Zr9.5 bulk metallic glasses exhibit a perfect fit with these novel expressions for ΔG, ΔH and ΔS. This finding clearly suggests that the hyperbolic expression of ΔCp provides an optimum mathematical model for the elucidation of glass forming ability, with increased accuracy and ease of modeling compared to previously reported expressions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "Understanding the long-term fate and potential mechanisms of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) after transplantation is essential for improving functional benefits of stem cell-based stroke treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered an attractive and clinically translatable tool for longitudinal tracking of stem cells, but certain controversies have arisen in this regard. In this study, we used SPION-loaded cationic polymersomes to label green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing MSCs to determine whether MRI can accurately reflect survival, long-term fate, and potential mechanisms of MSCs in ischemic stroke therapy. Our results showed that MSCs could improve the functional outcome and reduce the infarct volume of stroke in the brain. In vivo MRI can verify the biodistribution and migration of grafted cells when pre-labeled with SPION-loaded polymersome. The dynamic change of low signal volume on MRI can reflect the tendency of cell survival and apoptosis, but may overestimate long-term survival owing to the presence of iron-laden macrophages around cell graft. Only a small fraction of grafted cells survived up to 8 weeks after transplantation. A minority of these surviving cells were differentiated into astrocytes, but not into neurons. MSCs might exert their therapeutic effect via secreting paracrine factors rather than directing cell replacement through differentiation into neuronal and/or glial phenotypes.",

High availability architecture is constructed by virtual machines, distributed switches and storage pools. It employs virtualization technology to integrate physical servers and storages, where physical servers are responsible for the creation of virtual server cluster, distributed switches, storage pool and management of storages. Application server platform runs on the high availability architecture and our experiment result shows that HAASP, as a scalable and flexible architecture, could offer more persistent service compared with traditional application service platforms.",

The thin films were prepared with the base/acid two-step catalytic sol-gel process and the dip-coating method. The structure, reflective spectra and refractive index of the films were analyzed with TEM, AFM, SEM, spectrophotometer, and ellipsometery, respectively. The experimental results have shown that the base/acid two-step catalysis can adjust the refractive index of the nano-porous silica films from 1.18 to 1.42 rapidly and continuously. And a broadband antireflective coating made with the method has very low reflectance. The average reflectance of the coated glass in the solar energy spectrum decreases to 1.5% from ∼7% of the glass.",

Boron films were prepared as implantation targets on single-crystal Si(100) substrates by 13.56-MHz radio frequency sputtering. The diatomic single 30-keV nitrogen ions were chosen for implantation. The implantation dose ranged from 1×10 17 ions/cm 2 to 2×10 18 ions/cm 2 . The films were characterized using a transmission electron microscope. Several phases of boron nitride were found at the medium implantation dose. At the high dose of 2×10 18 ions/cm 2 , the pure c-BN phase was observed. It is believed that the transition from the low ordered phases to c-BN phase occurred during implantation. The films showed good adhesion to the Si substrate.",

The thin films were characterized by Ellipsometer, AFM, XRD, TG-DSC and UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer. The results show that with increase of heating temperature, TiO2 transforms from amorphous to anatase and then to rutile. The temperature at which rutile appeared and anatase turning into rutile completely decreases about 200°C. Crystallite size grows from 5.1nm to 227.3nm gradually. The refractive index of TiO2-V2O5 composite thin films changes from 1.6 to 2.4, and the thickness reduces from 276nm to 187nm simultaneously. The transmittance of the films in the ultraviolet range falls remarkably while the absorption edges take a red shift with the increase of annealing temperature.",

        "abstract": "Background: The efficacy of azathioprine (AZA) in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is well established. However, severe side effects limit its use in some patients. The impact of thiopurine S-methyltrarlsferase (TPMT) polymorphisms on AZA toxicity has been evaluated in several studies but with varying outcomes. Aims: To systematically evaluate the correlation between TPMT polymorphisms and AZA-induced side effects in IBD patients. Methods: Eligible articles that compared TPMT polymorphisms between AZA-tolerant and-intolerant adult IBD patients were collected from electronic databases. The outcome measure examined was the OR for TPMT gene mutation rate between IBD patients with and without AZA-induced overall side effects, bone marrow toxicity, hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis. Sensitivity analysis was also performed. The publication bias was tested by funnel plot. Results: Eight studies including a total of 1322 participants met our inclusion criteria. The OR for TPMT gene mutation rate between IBD patients with and without AZA-induced overall side effects and bone marrow toxicity were 2.93 (95% CI: 1.68-5.09, P<0.01) and 5.82 (95% CI: 2.93-11.55, P<0.01), respectively. The OR for TPMT gene mutation rate between IBD patients with and without AZA-indueed hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis were 1.51 (95% CI: 0.54-4.19, P=0.43) and 1.02 (95% CI: 0.26-3.99, P=0.98), respectively. Conclusions: TPMT polymorphisms are associated with AZA-indueed overall side effects and bone marrow toxicity, but not with hepatotoxieity and pancreatitis.",

Characterizations of the composition indicate that the as-synthesized aerogel is composed of molybdenum oxide and PAA derivatives; electron microscopy photographs show the hierarchical microstructure of the aerogel, including both spherical secondary particles and root-like primary fibers. Based on the analysis of coordination state and special morphology, it is suggested that the additive PAA not only guides the growth of the primary fibers but improves the crosslinkage between the secondary particles to form a robust skeleton. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To establish a reproducible rat model of disc degeneration by puncturing the annulus with needles of defined gauges, and to evaluate the effect by medical imaging. Methods: Total 32 skeletally mature male Sprague-Dawley rats, 20 were used to determine the depth of puncture by measuring anular thickness of lumbar disc, 12 rats were carried out transperitoneal ventral operation, and anular stab was performed using 21-gauge needle to make a full-thickness or partial-thickness stab incision in the L3/L4, L4/L5 and L5/L6 anteriorlateral disc. X-ray and MRI were performed before the operation and at 4, 8-week after operation, and histological analysis were performed. Results: The depth of puncture was respectively partial-thickness 1.5 mm and full-thickness 2.3 mm. There was no special radiological characterization after operation in control group, however, in X-ray films, lumbar intervertebral spaces stenosis and vertebral bodies unstability exist in the experimental group. The stabbed discs exhibited a decrease signal intensity from T2-weighted images starting at 4-week time point in full-thickness stab incision and 8-week in partial-thickness. Histological analysis revealed disc degeneration in both stab incision groups at 4-week time point and full-thickness stab incision displayed severely changes compared with partial-thickness. Conclusion: The method is reliable, effective and reproducible to establish a rat model of intervertebral disc degeneration by anulus stab incision with needles of defined gauges. It offers model to study the mechanism of lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration. Medical imaging, including X ray and MRI, can evaluate the early disc degeneration, and to evaluate the effect of degeneration model.",

        "abstract": "Heat management is crucial to polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell commercialization. Numerical modeling is often used to simulate heat transfer in the various components of the cell and specifically the gas diffusion layer (GDL). Due to the porous nature of the gas diffusion layer and its complexity of anisotropy, the effect of the structure on the thermal conductivity is usually taken into account by introducing an effective thermal conductivity. In this study, the effective thermal conductivity of carbon paper diffusion media was estimated numerically. Carbon paper is often used as the GDL in PEM fuel cells due to its ability to efficiently transport electrons, heat and gaseous species. Using the GeoDict code, a realistic three-dimensional pore morphology of carbon paper was used as the modeling domain and the governing mathematical equations were solved using the commercial software package Fluent (6.3.26) and the ThermoDict solver. The geometrical effects on the effective thermal conductivity were investigated for different geometries. It was found that the effective thermal conductivity is highly sensitive to the geometry of the porous material under investigation. The effective thermal conductivity is much larger in the in-plane direction when compared with the value in the through-plane direction. Further, the change of the effective thermal conductivity due to porosity and compression was studied. Finally, correlations for the through-plane and in-plane effective thermal conductivity were developed.",

This study was to analyze the diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) features of normal uterine cervix and cervical carcinoma, and assess the values of DWI in diagnosis and monitor of cervical carcinoma after radiotherapy.Routine MRI sequence and axial diffusion weighted sequence (b=800 s/mm2) were performed in 20 patients with cervical carcinoma and in 16 healthy women as control. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of normal uterine cervix and cervical carcinoma were compared. The ADC values of 7 cervical carcinoma patients before and after radiotherapy were compared.Normal uterine cervix presented 3 layers in DWI. The ADC value was significantly higher in normal uterine cervix than in cervical carcinoma [(1.71+/-0.14) x 10-3 mm2/s vs. (0.97+/-0.13) x 10(-3) mm2/s, P<0.01]. The ADC value of cervical carcinoma after radiotherapy was higher than that before radiotherapy [(1.49+/-1.40) x 10(-3) mm2/s vs. (1.02+/-0.06) x 10(-3) mm2/s], but was still lower than that of normal uterine cervix.DWI could be used to distinguish cervical carcinoma from normal uterine cervix, evaluate the extension of cervical carcinoma before therapy, and monitor the treatment response of cervical carcinoma after radiotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Huge collections of data have been created in recent years. Cloud computing has been widely accepted as the next-generation solution to addressing data-proliferation problems. Because of the explosion in digital data and the distributed nature of the cloud, as well as the increasingly large number of providers in the market, providing efficient cost models for composing data-intensive services will become central to this dynamic market. The location of users, service composers, service providers, and data providers will affect the total cost of service provision. Different providers will need to make decisions about how to price and pay for resources. Each of them wants to maximize its profit as well as retain its position in the marketplace. Based on our earlier work, this paper addresses the effect of data intensity and the communication cost of mass data transfer on service composition, and proposes a service selection algorithm based on an enhanced ant colony system for data-intensive service provision. In this paper, the data-intensive service composition problem is modeled as an AND/OR graph, which is not only able to deal with sequence relations and switch relations, but is also able to deal with parallel relations between services. In addition, the performance of the service selection algorithm is evaluated by simulations.",

By adjusting the degree of the symmetry of the networks designed by this rule, the spurious memories or unwanted attractors of the networks can be suppressed completely. We have extended this rule to design full-connected neural networks and diluted neural networks. Comparing the dynamics of these two neural networks, the simulation results indicated that the performance of diluted neural network was poorer than the performance of full-connected neural network. As to this point, further research is needed. In this paper, we use the annealed dilution method to design a diluted neural network with fixed degree of dilution. By analyzing the dynamics of the diluted neural network, it is verified that asymmetric full-connected neural network do have significant advantages over the asymmetric diluted neural network.",

The index of marrow conversion (signal intensity of the femoral neck and intertrochanteric area divided by signal intensity of the greater trochanter multiplied by 100%) was quantitatively measured and compared between SARS patients treated with steroid and without steroid and the normal control group.In 106 cases treated with steroid of the 148 health care workers, femoral head osteonecrosis was found in 4 cases, bilateral femoral marrow edema in 2 cases, femoral marrow infarction in 1 case. The index of marrow conversion in the normal controls, in SARS patients treated without and with steroids was (79.4 +/- 6.8)%, (86.9 +/- 7.4)%, (88.6 +/- 5.9)%, respectively. There was significantly statistical difference between groups (P < 0.05).In addition to fat conversion in the proximal femoral marrow due to steroid treatment, the infection of SARS itself may promote an excessively conversion of the red marrow to yellow marrow of the femoral neck in SARS patients.",

In general, it is considered that the intensity of scattering corresponds to the cluster size directly. However, this paper deduces that the intensity is not only related to cluster size, but also to gas density and binding probability. It suggests that gas density should be taken into account in analyzing the measurement results of Rayleigh scattering method. Furthermore, the method is applied in measuring the size distribution of argon cluster along the axis of nozzle. It is found that the cluster size doesn't vary linearly along the nozzle axis, whereas it reaches maximum at a certain position which depends on some parameters including the background pressure.",

In 124 health care workers, 38 cases have not treated with steroid, while 86 cases have treated with varied dosage. The imaging protocol was consisted of screening and full examination. Coronal T1-weighted imaging and short tau inversion recovery sequence were defined as the screening examination. The full examination was defined as images from the screening examination plus three additional imaging sequences: transverse and coronal T2-weighted imaging and short tau inversion recovery sequence.In 86 health care workers, 5 cases were found positive in the lower extremity. Osteonecrosis was found in 3 cases. One was involved in bilateral femoral head, and another was unilateral femoral head, and the remaining one was bilateral femoral heads and unilateral femoral condyle and tibial condyle. Bilateral femoral and tibial marrow edema were found in one case. Femoral infarction with significant calcification occurred in one health care worker. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the presence of avascular abnormalities was related with maximum daily dosage.Osteonecrosis definitely exists in the minority of health care workers with recovered SARS in Guangzhou, who had treated with steroid. The maximum daily dosage of steroid may significantly influence on the occurrence of avascular abnormalities.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The magnetic properties and magnetocaloric effect of EuTi 1−x Mn x O 3  (x = 0–0.1) compounds are investigated. When the Ti 4+  was substituted by Mn 2+ , the lattice constants were changed, the Eu 3+  state and the oxygen vacancy generated. The exchange mechanisms were more complex among the Mn 2+  3d, the Eu 5d and Eu 2+  4f. The FM phase was dominant between AFM and FM as Mn substitute for Ti, which improve the MCE under low magnetic field. The values of −Δ S M  max   are evaluated to 11.7 and 11.1 J/kg K for EuTi 0.975 Mn 0.025 O 3  and EuTi 0.95 Mn 0.05 O 3  compounds, under a magnetic field change of 1 T. And, the values of RC were obviously enhanced under the magnetic field changes of 1 and 2 T. Therefore, the giant reversible MCE makes these compounds promising candidates for magnetic refrigeration.",

An unexpected liquid–liquid phase separation occurs in VLE when applying the EoS mixing rules and some EoS/GE mixing rules to systems containing ammonia. Among all the mixing rules investigated, MHV1 is the only appropriate model. With the optimal mixing rule and UNIFAC model, the group parameters of ammonia and the group interaction parameters among −NH3, −CH3, −CH═CH2, −CF3, and −CHF2 were determined by regressing the VLE data. Better prediction was shown even than the PR–NRTL–MHV1 model. The theoretical PCSAFT EoS showed both advantages and disadvantages. It can predict the vapor–liquid–liquid phase equilibrium (VLLE) and VLE with only one interaction parameter once the successful regression of VLE data was done; however large deviations were displayed in ammonia + 1,1-difluoroethane/1-butene/pentafluoroethane systems.",

The traditional latent heat processing methods such as latent heat recovery, enthalpy and equivalent specific heat, are not suitable for accurate numerical calculation. Starting with the basic physical model, latent heat was introduced in the heat conduction equation as an inner heat source generation. This heat conduction equation can be employed directly for numerical simulation. Based on the analysis above, an integrated differential heat conduction equation was built that considered electric vortex heating, forced cooling, drawing rate, radiation and movement. The results of the numerical simulation agreed with the test result; that is, this mathematical model is correct and efficient.",

For the Gd-free hypereutectic alloy, the Cr(Mo) primary dendrites appear at the beginning of solidification when the withdrawal rate is 10 μm/s. As the solidification proceeds, the Cr(Mo) primary dendrite is eliminated, and the fully eutectic structure can be obtained in the steady-state zone. With increasing the withdrawal rate, the Cr(Mo) primary dendrites decrease gradually, and vanish at 90 μm/s. In addition, at a moderate withdrawal rate (30 μm/s), an optimum addition of Gd content (0.1 wt.%) results in the refinement of the microstructure, including the refinement of the eutectic cells and the intercellular region. Meanwhile, the new white phase ((Al x Gd1−x )2O3) appears in the boundary of the eutectic cells when the Gd content is not less than 0.1 wt.%.",

Firstly, by using of cupric chloride solution as precursor, polyacrylic acid as dispersant and propylene oxide as accelerator, and selecting suitable mould, the columnar copper-based alcogel was made under the sol-gel process. And the proper ratio of reactants was got via the experiment. Then the columnar light-green monolithic aerogel sample was obtained by the process of aging and supercritical drying. SEM studies indicate that the sample has a network porous structure composed of uniform nano-scale spherical particles. In term of IR, XRD and XRF, it indicates that the crystal part of the aerogel is mostly orthorhombic copper chloride hydroxide and the amorphous part is aquo cupric hydroxide.",

It can be seen that the Gibbs free energy difference decreases first because of the increase of Sn addition smaller than 3, then followed by a decrease due to the successive addition of Sn larger than 3, indicating that the thermal stabilities of these glass forming alloys increase first and then followed by a decrease owing to the excessive addition of Sn. Furthermore, the activation energies of Zr52.5Ti5Al10 Ni14.6Cu17.9 and (Zr52.5Ti5Al10 Ni14.6Cu17.9)0.97Sn3 were evaluated by the Kissinger equation. It is noted that the Sn addition increases the activation energies for glass transition and crystallization, implying that the higher thermal stability can be obtained by the appropriate addition of Sn.",

The silica films were prepared in a sol-gel process by a dip-coating method, and then were post annealed in air and a mixed gas atmosphere. The films were characterized with transmission electron microscope, scanning electron microscope, Fourier Transform infrared spectroscope, an ellipsometer, and the abrasion test, respectively. With the post annealing, the frequency shift of FTIR absorption ω4(TO3) peak of the films to a lower wave number results from a decrease in the average Si-O-Si bridging angle. An increase in the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the ω4 peak is ascribed to a wide distribution of the bridging angle because of the formation of strained Si-O-Si bonds caused by the post annealing. The abrasion and adhesion tests indicate that the mixed gas treatment noticeably strengthens the silica network. The increase in strength is attributed to more Si-O-Si bond cross-linkages between silica particles formed by the mixed gas treatment.",

We introduce a service oriented system, Teamwork as a Service (TaaS), to realize a new approach for enhancing teamwork performance in the mobile cloud environment. To coordinate most learners' talents and give them more motivation, an appropriate task allocation is necessary. Utilizing the Kolb's learning style (KLS) to refine learner's capabilities, and combining their preferences and tasks' difficulties, we formally describe this problem as a constraint optimization model. Two heuristic algorithms, namely genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA), are employed to tackle the teamwork-enhanced task allocation, and their performances are compared respectively. Having faster running speed, the SA is recommended to be adopted in the real implementation of TaaS and future development.",

By constructing an appropriate type of fuzzy weighting-dependent Lyapunov functional and adopting the free-weighting matrix method, a new delay-dependent stability criterion is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities(LMIs). Due to the reservation of some useful terms in the derivative of Lyapunov functional and the introduction of some relaxation matrices into the proposed Lyapunov functional, the results obtained in this paper may improve the existing ones.

SEM, AFM, IR and ellipsometer were used to characterize the structure and optical properties of the films. Mechanical property of films was measured by pencil hardness-testing device. Laser damage threshold of films was measured by a Q-switched Nd:YAG high power laser with the wave length of 1064 nm and the pulse width of 15 ns. The results show that UV-irradiation can improve the mechanical property and increase the refractive index of the films. Besides, the nodules on the surface of the films can be changed into pits by UV-irradiation process, so the laser damage threshold of sol-gel thin films will be increased. After UV-irradiation the laser damage threshold of single-layer ZrO 2 film reached 50.6 J/cm 2 (1064 nm, 1 ns). It is found that UV-irradiation is an effective method to avoid the infiltrating between the layers, and the degree of homogeneity of the multilayer films can be improved by this way.",

The aims of the present study are to validate the mainland Chinese translation of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (MCIBDQ), and to evaluate the impact of infliximab treatment on HRQOL in patients with IBD for the first time in China, as compared with other therapies of different levels. Furthermore, the impact of different medical therapies on marriage, employment and economic burden in IBD patients were also evaluated.Consecutive patients who met inclusion/exclusion criteria were investigated with MCIBDQ, SF-36, disease activity index (DAI), marriage, employment and economic burden questionnaires before and after treatment.MCIBDQ showed significant reliability and validity both in CD and UC patients. The scores of total SF-36, total MCIBDQ and all domains were found significantly increased, while both DAI and health transition on general health scores were found significantly decreased after infliximab treatment (all P &amp;lt; 0.001). Scores of SF-36 and MCIBDQ increased significantly more in infliximab group than non-infliximab group (all P &amp;lt; 0.05). Infliximab treatment was suggested to significantly reduce the negative impact on love (P = 0.037), increase work time (P = 0.016) and ease economic burden (P = 0.048).MCIBDQ was demonstrated to be a reliable and valid scale applied in Chinese IBD patients. Infliximab treatment was found to significantly improve HRQOL in IBD patients in comparison with conventional treatments. Negative impact on marriage, employment, and economic status was found in patients with IBD.",

        "abstract": "The Ba(ZrxTi1-x:)O3 (BZT) thin films were prepared by deposition of relevant materials on LaNiO3-coated silicon substrates by the sol-gel process. The films thus prepared show a (100) preferred orientation in structure and vary with zirconium content. With the addition of Zr, the grain sizes of films were found to decrease, whereas their microstructure became dense. The changes in the films' grain sizes and microstructure were attributed to the addition of Zr to the BaTiO3 lattice. Dielectric constant measurements revealed that the thin films show a relaxor behaviour and have a diffuse phase transition characteristic when x is 0.35. The hysteresis loops of the dielectric properties of films measured at room temperature were considered to be the result of the polarization state of the domains in these films in both the ferroelectric or paraelectric state. This leads to a distribution of Curie temperatures. The highest figure of merit value, K, was found for the BZT thin film with a very low dielectric constant. This indicates that BZT films have the potential to be used as microwave tunable devices with superior performance.",

        "abstract": "TiO2O5 nano-composite thin films were grown by sol-gel process with a mixture of Ti(OC4H9)4 and V2O5 powder as the staring materials. Influence of V2O5 on properties of the TiO2 nano-composite film was studied with X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and ultraviolet visible and near-infrared spectroscopy (UV-VIS-NIR). The results show that addition of V2O5 powder considerably affects the properties of the nano-composite films. First, it induces the growth of nano-particle on the film surface with nano-sized pores. Next, as the V2O5 content increases, the phase transition rate of TiO2 from anatase to rutile sharply increases, and the critical phase transition temperatures of rutile lowers by 200°C. The absorption in ultraviolet range markedly increases with a red shift of the absorption edges. Last, an increase of V2O5 content results in widening of the localized density of states but narrowing of the optical band gap.",

The dependence of microstructural length scales on the growth rate was investigated. The results show that, with the growth rate increasing, the primary dendritic arm spacings (PDAS) and secondary dendritic arm spacings (SDAS) decreased. There exists a large distribution range in PDAS under directional solidification conditions at a constant temperature gradient. The average PDAS and SDAS as a function of growth rate can be given as λ1 = 848.8967 V−0.4509 and λ2 = 64.2196 V−0.4140, respectively.

        "abstract": "Though long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as critical regulators of immune responses, whether they are involved in LPS-activated TLR4 signaling pathway and how is their expression regulated in mouse macrophages are still unexplored.By repurposing expression microarray probes, we identified 994 lncRNAs in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and classified them to enhancer-like lncRNAs (elncRNAs) and promoter-associated lncRNAs (plncRNAs) according to chromatin signatures defined by relative levels of H3K4me1 and H3K4me3. Fifteen elncRNAs and 12 plncRNAs are differentially expressed upon LPS stimulation. The expression change of lncRNAs and their neighboring protein-coding genes are significantly correlated. Also, the regulation of both elncRNAs and plncRNAs expression is associated with H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac. Crucially, many identified LPS-regulated lncRNAs, such as lncRNA-Nfkb2 and lncRNA-Rel, locate near to immune response protein-coding genes. The majority of LPS-regulated lncRNAs had at least one binding site among the transcription factors p65, IRF3, JunB and cJun.We established an integrative microarray analysis pipeline for profiling lncRNAs. Also, our results suggest that lncRNAs can be important regulators of LPS-induced innate immune response in BMDMs.",

        "abstract": "Basilar clivus is a common site of recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (RNPC). Biopsy of the basilar clivus is seldom done because of its deep location and complex anatomic structure, therefore, early differential diagnosis of radiofibrosis (RF) and RNPC at the basilar clivus is very difficult. This study was designed to investigate the characteristics of radiofibrosis and RNPC at the basilar clivus on dynamic enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DMRI) for differential diagnosis.A total of 38 NPC patients, treated in Cancer Center and the Second Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University with follow-up of 1-5 years, were divided into 2 groups: 22 in RF group and 16 in RNPC (RNPC at the basilar clivus) group. After conventional plain MRI scan of nasopharynx, DMRI and conventional contrast enhanced T(1)-weighted imaging (T1WI) were performed. Maximal contrast enhancement ratio (MCER), time to MCER (Tmax), and contrast enhancement ratio at the 40th second of DMRI (CER(40s)) of basilar clivus, condylar process, and nasal concha were measured.The MCER and CER(40s) of RF at the basilar clivus were lower, and the Tmax was longer than those of RNPC at the basilar clivus. When CER40s > or =150%, CER40s of basilar clivus > or = CER(40s) of nasal concha, and the combination of these 2 indexes were respectively set as the DMRI diagnostic criteria of RNPC at the basilar clivus, the diagnostic sensitivity of the second criterion was the highest (81.3%), and the diagnostic specificity of the third criterion was also the highest (86.4%).DMRI is helpful for differential diagnosis of radiofibrosis and RNPC at the basilar clivus. RNPC at the basilar clivus is highly suggested when it meet the criteria of both CER(40s) > or =150% and CER(40s) of basilar clivus > or = CER(40s) of nasal concha. When the 2 criteria are conflictive, the latter is more accurate, MCER and Tmax of the basilar clivus should be took into consideration.",

The clinical data, pathological findings, and MRI findings were reviewed retrospectively. MRI features of cervical NECs, SCCs, and adenocarcinomas were compared, and MRI staging of cervical NECs was compared with the pathological staging.Cervical NECs showed a higher tendency toward a homogeneous signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging and a homogeneous enhancement pattern, as well as a lower ADC value of tumour and a higher incidence of lymphadenopathy, compared with SCCs and adenocarcinomas (P < 0.05). An ADC value cutoff of 0.90 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s was robust for differentiation between cervical NECs and other cervical cancers, with a sensitivity of 63.3 % and a specificity of 95 %. In 21 patients who underwent radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy, the overall accuracy of tumour staging by MR imaging was 85.7 % with reference to pathology staging.Homogeneous lesion texture and low ADC value are likely suggestive features of cervical NECs and MR imaging is reliable for the staging of cervical NECs.• Cervical NECs show a tendency of lesion homogeneity and lymphadenopathy • Low ADC values are found in cervical NECs • MRI is an accurate imaging modality for the cervical NEC staging.",

This method emphasizes analyzing macro-hierarchy geological conditions controlling the development of the Pear River Deep-water Fan System, describing meso-hierarchy deep-water depositional architecture models under sequence stratigraphy study, and recognizing sedimentary source, feeding channel, fan micro-architecture and composing, depositional process, depositional rheology, reservoir and trap conditions of the Pearl River Deep-water Fan System by micro-hierarchy coupling response analysis.

        "abstract": "In pursuing high emission current density and high brightness, it is difficult to avoid vacuum breakdown in nanowire cold cathode systems, which will shorten the lifetime of the electron sources. Therefore, investigations on the vacuum breakdown process are important for semiconductor nanowire point electron sources. In this study, non-catastrophic breakdown phenomena that could extend the lifetime of the nanowire electron source were observed in the field emission processes of individual defective WO3-x nanowires. In this non-catastrophic breakdown process, only part of the nanowire emitter was destroyed. After the breakdown, the remaining part of the nanowire could still emit electrons, and due to the shortening of its length, the maximum field emission current density of the remaining nanowire was increased. These results are consistent with the prediction given by theoretical calculations. A defect-related electrical transport induced breakdown mechanism and Nottingham effect induced cooling effect were proposed to be the main causes of this phenomenon. Our work provides an approach for designing long lifetime semiconductor nanowire point electron sources.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a secure storage model named Peer to Cloud and Peer (P2CP). P2CP uses the cloud storage system as a backbone storage system. However, when data transmission occurs, the data nodes, cloud user, and the non-cloud user are involved to complete the transaction all together. The users, typically the client peers, can communicate with each other directly, thus bypassing servers on the cloud. Similarly, cloud servers can communicate with each other in a P2P mode. We also introduce a ''hierarchy security'' method to guarantee the data security in the proposed P2CP storage model. A key feature of our P2CP is that it has three data transmission tunnels: the cloud-user data transmission tunnel, the clients' data transmission tunnel, and the common data transmission tunnel. Assuming that the P2CP model follows the Poisson process or Little's law, we not only mathematically prove that the speed of P2CP is generally better than that of the pure peer-to-peer (P2P) model, the peer to server and peer (P2SP) model or the pure cloud model, but also testify the results through simulations. Beyond security, we also investigate the performance of another characteristic of usability of the data storage, namely availability, where P2CP is more robust to the failures of peers or servers in the cloud environment.",

However, traditional workflow definition languages, such as extended XPDL and service-oriented BPEL4WS, have become insufficient to specify business process semantics, especially the descriptions of inputs, outputs, preconditions and effects. In this paper, we propose a novel solution based on OWL-S, a semantic Web ontology language that leverages service discovery, invocation and negotiation more effectively. The enhanced SwinDeW-S architecture is adapted with advanced ontology-based service profiles, and it takes advantage of a well-developed profile generation tool, which translates the BPEL4WS process models to the OWL-S profiles. As a result, in a new prototype equipped with both BPEL4WS and OWL-S, communications and coordination among service flow peers have become better organised and more efficient.",

Samples of different densities, different catalyst conditions and other different preparation circumstances were investigated via small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The power-law depndence of the scattered intensity, a characteristic of fractal structures, was observed for the acid, neutral and base catalyzed aerogels. A crossover from the power-law characteristic of fractal structures to surface scattering was observed too. While for the aerogels derived from a two-step sol-gel process, no power-law dependence of the scattered intensity was observed. Oxidation of the samples proved to only smooth the surface of the primary particles, it did not influence the aerogels structures.",

The results show that with the increasing of withdrawal rate the micro-porosity level of the samples decreases. The micro-porosity level at v=50 μm/s is about 10 percent of that at v=5 μm/s and the micro-porosity level at v=100 μm/s is about 70-90 percent of that at v=50 μm/s. The primary arm spacing and the secondary arm spacing both decrease while the withdrawal rate increases. The influence of withdrawal rate on the micro-porosity level depends on the arm spacing.",

The ingots were prepared by 5 kilogram Vacuum Induction Melting Furnace. Then LaFe 10.85Co 0.65Si 1.5 C 0.2 and LaFe 11.5 Si 1.5C 0.2 thin strips were prepared by the strip-casting process. The DSC measurement shows that the maximum latent heat of LaFe 11.5Si 1.5 C 0.2 thin strips has been obtained after annealing at 1353 K for 12 h, longer time annealing seems to be no good for latent heat. Substitute Co for Fe could cause inhomogeneous distribution of Curie temperature &(T-C) in the bulk ingots, but the inhomogeneity can be improved by preparing the strip from the ingot. Under magnetic field changes of 0-1.5 T, the magnetic entropy change near the Curie temperature was about -11.1 J/kg\\cK and -}4.0J/kg\\cK for LaFe 11.5Si 1.5C 0.2 and LaFe 10.85Co 0.65Si 1.5 C 0.2, respectively. © 2012 IEEE.",

Effects of silicon addition on phase characteristics and mechanical properties of tempered M3:2 high-speed steel were investigated by using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and energy spectrum analysis. Phase analysis results show that silicon distributes mainly in tempered martensite and M 6C carbides, but rarely in MC carbides. The content of silicon in tempered martensite of high-speed steel increases with the increasing silicon addition. The addition of silicon exerts a crucial role on the the lattice constant of ferrite in tempered martensite. For the case of 0.7 wt.% silicon addition, the alloy exhibits the maximum lattice constant. Mechanical property test results show that suitable silicon addition can improve the secondary hardening effects of M3:2 high-speed steel. M3:2 high-speed steel with 0.7 wt.% silicon addition possesses the excellent combination of high hardness and high bending strength after double tempering at 550 °C.",

For the directional solidification of liquid metal cooling technique (LMC), only the small quantity of Cr(Mo) primary dendrites appear in the beginning of solidification, and the fully and well-aligned lamellar structure parallel to the growth direction is obtained in the steady-state zone. However, the Cr(Mo) primary phase is always observed in the whole directional solidification of zone melted liquid metal cooling technique (ZMLMC), and the eutectic lamellas are disordered and not parallel to the growth direction in the steady-state zone. Compared to the ZMLMC alloys, the LMC alloy has the better room temperature fracture toughness and compressive property due to the well-aligned lamellar structure. Crack propagation and fracture surface are also observed to understand the fracture behavior.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic properties and magnetocaloric effects (MCEs) of the intermetallic Ho 3Al 2 compound are investigated by magnetization and heat capacity measurements. Two successive magnetic transitions, a spin-reorientation (SR) transition at T SR=31 K followed by a ferromagnetic (FM) to paramagnetic (PM) transition at T C=40 K, are observed. Both magnetic transitions contribute to the MCE and result in a large magnetic entropy change (ΔS M) in a wide temperature range. The maximum values of -ΔS M and adiabatic temperature change (ΔT ad) reach 18.7 J/kg K and 4.8 K for the field changes of 0-5 T, respectively. In particular, a giant value of refrigerant capacity (RC) is estimated to be 704 J/kg for a field change of 5 T, which is much higher than those of many potential refrigerant materials with similar transition temperatures. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It is found that when Mn content reaches x=3, a field-induced metamagnetic transition takes place. An external magnetic field can reduce TM to a lower temperature at a rate of 3.5 K/T, thereby yielding a large magnetic entropy change ΔS near room temperature. The ΔS magnitude attains to 33 J/kg K under a magnetic field of 5 T at 285 K for the sample with x=3, while the temperature span of the ΔS peak can reach 15 K because of the reduction in TM by the external magnetic field. The calculated refrigerant capacity reaches 279 J/kg for the sample with x=3. These values of the magnetocaloric parameters suggest that these alloys are suitable candidates for magnetic refrigerants. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.",

        "abstract": "Boron nanowires (BNWs) may have potential applications as reinforcing materials because B fibers are widely known for their excellent mechanical performance. However until now, there have been only few reports on the mechanical properties of individual BNW, and in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations shining a light on their fracture mechanism have not been performed. In this paper, we applied in situ high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) technique to study the mechanical properties of individual BNWs using three loading schemes. The mean fracture strength and the maximum strain of individual BNWs were measured to be 10.4 GPa and 4.1%, respectively, during the tensile tests. And the averaged Young's modulus was calculated to be 308.2 GPa under tensile and compression tests. Bending experiments for the first time performed on individual BNWs revealed that their maximum bending strain could reach 9.9% and their ultimate bending stress arrived at 36.2 GPa. These figures are much higher than those of Si and ZnO nanowires known for their high bending strength. Moreover, the BNWs exhibited very high specific fracture strength (3.9 (GPa·cm(3))/g) and specific elastic modulus (130.6 (GPa·cm(3))/g), which are several dozens of times larger compared to many nanostructures known for their superb mechanical behaviors. At last, the effect of surface oxide layer on the Young's modulus, fracture strength and maximum bending strength of individual BNWs was elucidated to extract their intrinsic mechanical parameters using calculated corrections. All experimental results suggest that the present BNW are a bright promise as lightweight reinforcing fillers.",

        "abstract": "An oxygen-assisted field emission treatment is introduced for improving field emission uniformity of carbon nanotube (CNT) pixel arrays. Oxygen gas is added during the field emission process, and the uniformity of both emission area and brightness of a CNT pixel array are dramatically improved by 83% and 90%, respectively, without reducing emission stability. The underlying physical mechanism for the improvements is attributed to the fact that the oxygen oxidizes the highly emitting CNTs, resulting in their burning out. As a result, the emitting CNTs having a too high current are removed and more and more emitting CNTs with weak current can be stimulated at a higher field, leading finally to a balance of emission from each pixel in the array.",

        "abstract": "Testable prediction outcomes generated by computational models based on available databases are the primary sources helping to design biological experiments. Although numerous databases have been designed by collecting data either only from literature manually or together with prediction outcomes from computational models, there is currently not a comprehensive data service framework delivering better insights for these results. In this paper, we introduce a biological sequence data service towards delivering deeper insights and helping better biological experiments design. The service includes following major components: a comprehensive database for storing biological data, data analytics tools for analysing biological data, and computational models for delivering testable prediction outcomes. Specifically, we present this service in a framework for studies on host-pathogen interactions. The design of this framework aims to improve the understanding of host-pathogen interactions. The relationships of hierarchical databases and their working mechanism, specifically between PPIs and DDIs, are also presented in this framework. Finally, the preliminary and practical experiences of building computational model for prediction is discussed.",

        "abstract": "Modeling the vapor liquid phase equilibrium of mixed refrigerants is the essential precondition for the calculation of refrigeration system. In this work, the study on 48 pure substances and 58 binary systems consisting of CxHy and CxHyFz was performed. Both Peng–Robinson (PR) and perturbed-chain SAFT (PCSAFT) were investigated. The relationship between the parameters in PR and PCSAFT was exhibited. Strong linear function of the volume parameter mσ3 in PCSAFT with covolume parameter b in PR were found, as well as the energy parameter me2 in PCSAFT with energy parameter a/b in PR. This correlated characteristic provides an idea for regressing pure substance parameters and a criterion whether the regressed parameters are reasonable or not. The interaction parameters in PR-VDW and PCSAFT show consistent tendency, and both are limited to a very narrow range. The simple predictive method was proposed by using the average value 0.146 for PR-VDW and 0.093 for PCSAFT. The internal correlated behaviors result that...",

By adjusting the amount of CuCl·2HO, CuO/SiO composite aerogels with different molar ratio of Cu/Si such as 1, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 35 % was prepared. Finally, via a self-built device and sol-co-gelation technic, a continuous formation process was developed to fabricate the composition-gradient CuO/SiO composite aerogel. Density of these aerogels was about 200 mg/cm, the composition-gradient CuO/SiO composite aerogel was cylindrical and about 2.5 cm in height. Scanning electron microscope was used to characterize its microstructure at different position. X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive spectrometer and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer were used to characterize its composition and composition distribution, the results showed that the cylindrical CuO/SiO composite aerogel’s molar ratio of Cu/Si changed from 31.06 to 4.43 % as the measure point from the bottom up, the whole sample displayed obvious composition-gradient.",

        "abstract": "Transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) is emerging as a new therapeutic approach for stroke. Real-time imaging of transplanted NSCs is essential for successful cell delivery, safety monitoring, tracking cell fate and function, and understanding the interactions of transplanted cells with the host environment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of magnetic nanoparticle-labeled cells has been the most widely used means to track stem cells in vivo. Nevertheless, it does not allow for the reliable discrimination between live and dead cells. Reporter gene-based MRI was considered as an alternative strategy to overcome this shortcoming. In this work, a class of lentiviral vector-encoding ferritin heavy chain (FTH) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was constructed to deliver reporter genes into NSCs. After these transgenic NSCs were transplanted into the contralateral hemisphere of rats with acute ischemic stroke, MRI and fluorescence imaging (FLI) were performed in vivo for tracking the fate of transplanted cells over a long period of 6 wk. The results demonstrated that the FTH and EGFP can be effectively and safely delivered to NSCs via the designed lentiviral vector. The distribution and migration of grafted stem cells could be monitored by bimodal MRI and FLI. FTH can be used as a robust MRI reporter for reliable reporting of the short-term viability of cell grafts, whereas its capacity for tracking the long-term viability of stem cells remains dependent on several confounding factors such as cell death and the concomitant reactive inflammation.",

A charge-orbital ordering (COO) transition was found in the region of low temperature for strained (001)-LCeMO/STO films. The gradual vanishing of the COO transition with the relaxation of tensile epitaxial strain indicates the key role of tensile strain in the formation of COO. Furthermore, the results of dynamic strains on (001)-LCeMO/PMN-PT film show that even a small strain modification of ∼ -0.1 could evidently change the magnetotransport properties around TCOO, verifying the dominant role of the tensile strain. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.",

According to the environment and the concrete geological conditions,the comprehensive reinforcement method of prestressed anchor cable,self-drilling anchor bolt,steel-net and shotcrete is adopted for the slope using the engineering analogism and experiential method. Rational design parameters,reasonable reinforcement structure form and scientific construction process ensure the reinforcement measures to play roles fully. Based on the crack location surveyed during drilling hole and slope limit equilibrium theory,the mechanical parameters of rock are obtained by inverse calculation method.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Waste heat sources such as flue gas generate large temperature span during recovery process. In order to improve the temperature match with such waste heat sources, a novel absorption refrigeration system with continuous-temperature-changing generation process is proposed. Internal heat recovery process is introduced to both the generator and absorber, and a premixer is added to take the place of the solution heat exchanger in traditional system. A numerical model of the system is built, in which the continuous-temperature-changing generation process is simulated based on a stripping column with heat input at each stage. New parameters are defined and optimized to strengthen the internal heat recovery process, and thus to improve system efficiency. Simulation results show that the system can operate under a large waste heat temperature span of 67.5 K, almost twice of the conventional system. With the evaporation temperature, waste heat inlet temperature, and cooling water temperature at -15°C, 150°C and 20°C, respectively, a maximum COP of 0.93 and exergy efficiency of 49.7% is acquired while the waste heat temperature span is 60 K, showing that the system can acquire larger utilization rate of waste heat with higher system efficiency.",

The measurement results show that the density of Al thin foil, the thickness of aluminum oxide, the cluster size and the surface roughness of Al thin foil are 2.312 g·cm-3, 7 nm, 0.1 μm and 5.3 nm respectively, hence the self-supporting thin foil perturbation target prepared through evaporation do can meet the requirements of inertial confinement fusion.",

In this paper, the vapor liquid phase equilibrium for the ammonia + 1,1-difluoroethane system at temperatures ranging from 253.150 K to 293.150 K were studied. The Peng–Robinson equation of state with the Huron–Vidal mixing rule involving the non-random two-liquid activity coefficient model was employed to describe the VLE behavior of the system concerned. The maximum average absolute relative deviation of pressure and average absolute deviation of vapor phase are 0.31% and 0.009, respectively. A positive azeotropic behavior was exhibited at the experimental temperature range.",

        "abstract": "The &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;in situ&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; characterization on the individuals offers an effective way to explore the dynamic behaviors and underlying physics of materials at the nanoscale, and this is benefit for the actual applications. In the field of vacuum micro-nano electronics, the existing &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;in situ&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; techniques can obtain the material information such as structure, morphology and composition in the process of electron emission driven by a single source of excitation. However, the relevant process and mechanism become more complicated when two or more excitation sources are commonly acted on the emitters. In this paper, we present an &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;in situ&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; nano characterization technique to trigger and record the electron emission behavior under the photo-electric-common-excitation multiple physical fields. Specifically, we probed into the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;in situ&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; electron emission from an individual vertical few-layer graphene (vFLG) emitter under a laser-plus-electrostatic driving field. Electrons were driven out from the vFLG's emission edge, operated &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;in situ&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; under an external electrostatic field coupled with a 785 nm continuous-wave laser-triggered optical field. The incident light has been demonstrated to significantly improve the electron emission properties of graphene, which were recorded as an obvious decrease of the turn-on voltage, a higher emission current by factor of 35, as well as a photo-response on-off ratio as high as 5. More importantly, during their actual electron emission process, a series of &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;in situ&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; characterizations such as SEM observation and Raman spectra were used to study the structure, composition and even real-time Raman frequency changes of the emitters. These information can further reveal the key factors for the electron emission properties, such as field enhancement, work function and real-time surface temperature. Thereafter, the emission mechanism of vFLG in this study has been semi-quantitatively demonstrated to be the two concurrent processes of photon-assisted thermal enhanced field emission (PTFE) and photo field emission (PFE).",

The morphology and microstructure of the gas-atomized powders, as-sprayed coating, and sealed coating were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The corrosion behavior of the coatings in HCl solution was examined using potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results show that the aluminum phosphate sealant can penetrate into the coating and fill the microcracks. The corrosion resistance of the coatings is considerably enhanced after sealing treatment because the aluminum phosphate sealant prevents the penetration of corrosive solution. The corrosion resistance of sealed coatings decreases with the increase in HCl solution concentration. This work demonstrates that aluminum phosphate sealing is an effective method for filling the microcracks and improving the corrosion resistance of Fe-based amorphous coatings in HCl solution.",

Both metal ions individually caused significant cell performance degradation at a level of only 5 ppm mol in air. In addition, elevated temperature accelerated fuel cell performance degradation in the presence of Fe 3+ . Moreover, the presence of Fe 3+ in an operating fuel cell resulted in the cell's sudden death, due to the formation of membrane pinholes that may have been promoted by the enhanced production of peroxy radicals catalyzed by Fe species. Half-cell tests in liquid electrolyte revealed that the presence of Al 3+ in the electrolyte changed the kinetics and mechanisms of the oxygen reduction reaction by reducing the kinetic current densities and the electron transfer number.

The result of the hybridisation is an enhanced search algorithm obtained by incorporating the local search capability rendered by the hill-climbing optimisation with the global search ability provided by GAs. The proposed algorithm has been compared with other clustering algorithms under the same category using an artificial data set and a benchmark problem. Results show, in all cases, that the proposed algorithm outperforms its counterparts in terms of global search capability. Moreover, the scalability of the proposed algorithm to high-dimensional problems featuring a large number of data points has been validated using an application to compress field data sets from sub-15MW industry gas turbines, during commissioning. Such compressed field data is expected to result in more efficient and more accurate sensor fault detection.",

The alloy consisting mainly of γ-TiAl/α 2 -Ti 3 Al lamellar structure exhibited a superior oxidation resistance at 700 °C, and followed parabolic oxidation kinetics at 800 °C and 900 °C. The observed multi-layered scale structure consisted of TiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 -rich, Al 2 O 3 +TiO 2 , H-Ti 2 AlN+Al 2 O 3 +α 2 -Ti 3 Al, Z-Ti 5 Al 3 O 2 +AlNb 2 +Laves-(Ti,Nb)Cr 2 , and H-Ti 2 AlN/α 2 -Ti 3 Al lamellae from the outside to inside after high-temperature oxidation. The γ-TiAl/α 2 -Ti 3 Al lamellae near the scale/substrate interface were first transformed into H-Ti 2 AlN/α 2 -Ti 3 Al lamellae, with orientation relationships identified as       (  0001  )     α  2     /  /    (  0001  )    T   i  2   A  l  N      ,       (  10    1  ¯    0  )     α  2     /  /    (  10    1  ¯    0  )    T   i  2   A  l  N       and       [  1    2  ¯    10  ]     α  2     /  /    [  1    2  ¯    10  ]    T   i  2   A  l  N      . The H-Ti 2 AlN/α 2 -Ti 3 Al lamellae were then transformed into a metastable Z-Ti 5 Al 3 O 2  phase at the scale/substrate interface. The Z-phase was decomposed to Ti 3 Al and Al 2 O 3  as the scale/substrate interface moved inwardly. Ti 3 Al reacted further with oxygen and nitrogen to form Ti 2 AlN, which was finally oxidized to form TiO 2  and α-Al 2 O 3 . A Nb-rich layer was present beneath the scale along with the formation of AlNb 2  and Laves phase, and the doping effect of Nb to suppress the diffusion of oxygen occurred mainly in the TiO 2 +Al 2 O 3  compound layer. The results obtained in this study would pave the way for the development of advanced oxidation-resistant TiAl-based materials for high-temperature applications.",

The composite aerogels were obtained by adding a silver colloid to an about-to-gel silica sol prepared and then dried in supercritical anhydrous ethyl alcohol. The silver colloid and composite aerogels with silver content of 0wt%, 0.5wt%, 1wt% and 3.5wt% were characterized by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and N 2 Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET). The results show that silver nanoparticles with size about 40nm are successfully impregnated into the spongy porous structure of silica. The surface area decreases from 845 to 443m 2/g with the increase of silver content. And the nanoscopic surface and bulk properties of each component are retained in the solid composite. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.",

A rotary-type magnetic refrigerator has been built with a modified double Halbach permanent magnet array, which can provide an average magnetic field varying from 0.04 T to 1.50 T at a length of 100 mm. To evaluate the performance of AMRs with geometries, active magnetic regenerators (AMR) filled with gadolinium plates, spheres and flakes were respectively tested and compared. System performance such as temperature span, cooling power and pressure drop were investigated at different utilization factors and operating frequencies. The results revealed three AMRs performed quite differently. With larger specific heat transfer areas and smaller hydraulic diameters, AMRs filled with flakes/spheres provided better cooling performance. A maximum no-load temperature span of 14.8 K was obtained by flake-AMR with largest specific heat transfer areas and least filled mass. Sphere-AMR achieved a maximum temperature span of 10.8 K at a cooling power of 10 W among AMRs. With the same porosity and filled mass, sphere-AMR performed much better than plate-AMR, although the latter had a smaller pressure drop and associated pumping work.",

The device architecture is designed such that only the middle part of the BP is aligned over the graphene flake, enabling the flexible tuning of the charge carriers in the BP over the graphene charge-trapping layer.

        "abstract": "It is quite common in tourism industry that a tourist would love to gain the most wonderful experience from visiting multiple places in one trip. This is a service composition problem and is difficult to manage because of several reasons. We address this problem by proposing an agent-based service composition framework to allocate to the tourist an optimal composite service. We take into account a number of factors including: 1 all the places of interest must be visited; 2 the preference on visiting places must be obeyed; 3 the total price is within the budget; 4 the time constraint must be obeyed; 5 the payoffs for service providers are worthwhile and fair. We propose a bottom-up approach to allocate the optimal service composition where intelligent agents are deployed to provide flexibility and efficiency to the system. As a result, the system is more independent and every party is better off.",

        "abstract": "Genetic factors are crucial in the development of Crohn's disease (CD). Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are known to function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges and regulate a number of signalling pathways via circRNA‑miRNA interactions. As competing endogenous RNAs, the functions of circRNAs in CD should be investigated. In the present study, colon biopsy tissues were collected from ileocolon (L3)‑active CD patients and healthy controls. circRNA microarrays were performed with colon tissues from 3 CD patients and 3 controls. Subsequently, the candidate circRNAs were verified via reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction using colon tissues from a further 10 CD patients and 10 controls. Targeted miRNAs, genes and pathways of candidate circRNAs were predicted and analysed. Arraystar circRNA microarrays demonstrated that there were 163 upregulated circRNAs targeting 435 miRNAs and 55 downregulated circRNAs targeting 207 miRNAs (fold‑change >2 and P<0.01) in CD patients. As a candidate circRNA, hsa‑circRNA‑102685 was observed to putatively target hsa‑miR‑146b‑5p, hsa‑miR‑182‑5p and hsa‑miR‑146a‑5p. Furthermore, Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis predicted that hsa‑circRNA‑102685 potentially participated in apoptosis, and in the Toll‑like receptor and p53 signalling pathways. Overall, the current study suggested that circRNA alterations serve an important role in the pathogenesis of CD. circRNAs, such as hsa‑circRNA‑102685, are involved in certain important signalling pathways of CD, and may be novel targets for diagnosis or treatment in this disease.",

Pd doped WO3 films were coated on silicon wafers and ordinary slide glasses by dip-coating method. The grain distribution of WO3 sol doped with PdCl2 was measured by Laser Particle Size Analyzer. Surface morphology and microstructure of WO3 films which doped or undoped with PdCl2 were analyzed by AFM, which show that PdCl 2 has an important effect on the structure of the WO3 films. The gasochromic properties of the films are investigated by UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The WO3 films show good gasochromic properties. The effect of concentration of PdCl2 on gasochromic kinetic process of WO3 films was investigated. Finally the modulation of the light transmittance by the gasochromic films was discussed.",

        "abstract": "WO3 nanowire films have been prepared by thermal evaporation on both a silicon substrate and a quartz substrate. The gasochromic effect and the colouration mechanism of the films are investigated in detail by ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-vis-NIR) spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, micro-Raman spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrical transport measurements. The studies reveal that the gasochromism of WO3 nanowire films is caused by hydrogen injection. Along with the injection, a part of the tungsten ions' valences and the lattice structure change, giving rise to the colouration of the films. Moreover, electrical transport measurements show the lower conductance of the coloured film, which further confirms the hydrogen injection mechanism. Finally, a gasochromic model of the WO3 nanowire films is proposed. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Samples of different densities, different catalyst conditions, and different preparation processes including the common one-step and the special two-step sol-gel processes were investigated via small-angle x-ray scattering. The power-law dependence of the scattered intensity, a characteristic of fractal structures, was observed for all the one-step aerogels. A crossover from the power-law characteristic of fractal structures to surface scattering was also observed. For the aerogels derived from the two-step sol-gel process, no power-law dependence of the scattered intensity was observed, signifying a lack of fractal structure. Oxidation of the samples smoothed the particle surfaces but did not influence the aerogel structures. The monolithic xerogel was found to consist of spherical particles with size of about 10 nm.",

Methods CT and MRI findings in 10 patients with surgical-pathologically-proved islet cell tumor were retrospectively analyzed. Results of 10 cases, 8 were functional insulinoma and 2 were nonfunctional tumors, including 4 cases malignant islet cell tumor. Most of the islet cell tumor appeared iso-attenuation and slightly enhanced on conventional CT, which was easily ignored. MRI showed hypo-intensity signal on T1-weighted images and hyper-intensity signal on T2-weighted images, with slightly enhancement on conventional contrast images but intensely enhancement on early phase after dynamic contrast enhancement. The size of insulinoma was relatively small, while that of nonfunctional or malignant islet cell tumors were relatively larger. Liver or lymphoid metastases were frequently occurred in malignant islet cell tumors. Conclusion The islet cell tumors reveal some characteristic imaging features. MR imaging, especially dynamic contrast enhancement MR imaging can provide more diagnostic information about the islet cell tumors than conventional CT.",

The silica films were prepared with the two-step catalytic sol-gel process and a dip-coating method, and then post annealed in air and a mixed gas atmosphere. The films were characterized with FE-SEM, AFM, TEM, XPS, FTIR, an ellipsometer, and an abrasion test. With the post annealing, the frequency shift of the FTIR absorption ω4(TO3) peak of the films to a lower wavenumber results from a decrease in the average Si-O-Si bridging angle. An increase in the full-width at half-maximum of the ω4 peak is ascribed to a wide distribution of the bridging angle because of formation of strained Si-O-Si bonds caused by the post annealing. XPS analysis shows that the effect of the mixed gas annealing on the binding energy and full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) for Si (2p) and O (1s) peaks is attributed to the further condensation reaction of the films resulting from the disappearance of the OH groups. The abrasion and adhesion tests indicate that the two-step catalysis obviously improves the scratch resistance and adhesion of the films, and that the mixed gas treatment further strengthens the silica network. The increase in strength is attributed to more Si-O-Si bond cross-linkages between silica particles formed by the two-step catalysis and the mixed gas treatment.",

        "abstract": "Cell-based therapy with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising strategy for acute ischemic stroke. In vivo tracking of therapeutic stem cells with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is imperative for better understanding cellular survival and migrational dynamics over time. In this study, we develop a novel biocompatible nanocomplex (ASP-SPIONs) based on cationic amylose, by introducing spermine and the image label, ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), to label MSCs. The capacity, efficiency, and cytotoxicity of the nanocomplex in transferring SPIONs into green fluorescence protein-modified MSCs were tested; and the performance of in vivo MRI tracking of the transplanted cells in acute ischemic stroke was determined. The results demonstrated that the new class of SPIONs-complexed nanoparticles based on biodegradable amylose can serve as a highly effective and safe carrier to transfer magnetic label into stem cells. A reliable tracking of transplanted stem cells in stroke was achieved by MRI up to 6 weeks, with the desirable therapeutic benefit of stem cells on stroke retained. With the advantages of a relatively low SPIONs concentration and a short labeling period, the biocompatible complex of cationic amylose with SPIONs is highly translatable for clinical application. It holds great promise in efficient, rapid, and safe labeling of stem cells for subsequent cellular MRI tracking in regenerative medicine.",

We have observed enhanced field emission from large-area arrays of W18O 49 pencil-like nanostructure due to both the effects of high aspect ratio and enlarged spacing between neighboring nanostructures. These arrays may be grown on silicon substrates by the multi-step thermal evaporation process. The spacing of nanotip-to-nanotip between neighboring nanostructures may be increased by adjusting the growth temperature. The arrays are observed to have a typical turn-on field as low as about 1.26 MV/m and a threshold field as low as about 3.39 MV/m, resulting in increasing field enhancement and decreasing field screening effect. © 2010 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Scanning electron microscopy investigation reveals that global plasticity benefits from abundant shear band multiplication and interactions. Atomic level flows are seen to accompany profuse shear bands. The plasticity enhancement of this metallic glass benefits from such atomic level flows. Atomic level flow facilitates the activation of shear transformation zones that further self-assemble to promote shear band multiplication. On the other hand, it also mitigates the shear band propagation that prevents catastrophic shear band extension. © 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Urumqi city is located in central part of northern piedmont of Tian shan mountain. The mean direction of principal compressive stress in central section of northern Tianshan deduced from the focal mechanism solutions is around N10°E, with a clear feature of gradual change from west to east. In the region of Urumqi city, the direction derived from focal mechanism solutions of moderate-strong earthquakes is N15°-20°E. The principal stress direction found from fault striation inversion is N17°W-N2°E. The stress direction deduced from the above two data sets are basically in the variation range of the principal compressive stress in the central section of northern Tianshan. However, the stress direction inferred from composite fault-plane solutions of small earthquakes within 25 km of the Urumqi seismic station is N40°-46°E, which shows a deviation of 20°-30° from that of regional principal compressive stress. Nevertheless, the direction of maximum horizontal compressive stress measured in the boreholes in Urumqi city is around N55°E, which displays a further deviation of 10°-15°, and its deviation from that of regional stress field is up to 30°-40°. These phenomena indicate that a tension stress in the shallow layers in front part of the compressive fault-fold region has been superposed to the regional NNE-SSW trending compressive tectonic stress and makes the direction of local principal compressive stress turn to NEE-SWW. This is one of the causes why the normal faults, such as the Jiujiawan fault groups, were developed in Urumqi city.",

        "abstract": " The purpose of this study was to investigate the performance of quantitative parameters derived from dual-energy CT (DECT) in the preoperative diagnosis of regional metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) in patients with colorectal cancer.  Triphasic contrast-enhanced DECT was performed for 178 patients with colon or high rectal cancer. The morphologic criteria, short-axis diameter, and quantitative DECT parameters of the largest regional LN were measured and compared between pathologically metastatic and nonmetastatic LNs. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine the independent DECT parameters for predicting LN metastasis. Diagnostic performance measures were assessed by ROC curve analysis and compared by McNemar test.  A total of 178 largest LNs (72 metastatic, 106 nonmetastatic) were identified in 178 patients. The best single DECT parameter for differentiation between metastatic and nonmetastatic LNs was normalized effective atomic number (Z) in the portal venous phase (AUC, 0.871; accuracy, 84.8%). These values were higher than those of morphologic criteria (AUC, 0.505-0.624; accuracy, 47.8-62.4%) and short-axis diameter (AUC, 0.647; accuracy, 66.3%) ( < 0.05). The diagnostic accuracy of combined normalized iodine concentration in the arterial phase and normalized effective atomic number in the portal venous phase was further improved to 87.1% (AUC, 0.916).  Quantitative parameters derived from DECT can be used to improve preoperative diagnostic accuracy in evaluation for regional metastatic LNs in patients with colorectal cancer.",

        "abstract": "Water resource problems currently are much more important in proper planning especially for arid regions, such as Gansu in China. For agricultural and industrial activities, prediction of groundwater status is critical. As a main branch of neural network, shallow artificial neural network models have been deployed in prediction areas such as groundwater and rainfall since late 1980s. In this paper, artificial neural network (ANN) model within a newly proposed algorithm has been developed for groundwater status forecasting. Having considered previous algorithms for ANN model in time series forecast, this new Monte Carlo based algorithm demonstrated a good result. The experiments of this ANN model in predicting groundwater status were conducted on the Heihe River area dataset, which was curated on the collected data. When compared with its original physical based model, this ANN model was able to achieve a more stable and accurate result. A comparison and an analysis of this ANN model were also presented in this paper.",

        "abstract": "Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which is highly expressed in gastric cancers, interacts with programmed death-1 (PD-1) on T cells and is involved in T-cell immune resistance. To increase the therapeutic safety and accuracy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, RNA interference through targeted gene delivery was performed in our study. We developed folic acid (FA)- and disulfide (SS)-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated polyethylenimine (PEI) complexed with superparamagnetic iron oxide Fe3O4 nanoparticles (SPIONs) as a siRNA-delivery system for PD-L1 knockdown. The characterization, binding ability, cytotoxicity, transfection efficiency, and cellular internalization of the polyplex were determined. At nitrogen:phosphate (N:P) ratios of 10 or above, the FA-PEG-SS-PEI-SPIONs bound to PD-L1 siRNA to form a polyplex with a diameter of approximately 120 nm. Cell-viability assays showed that the polyplex had minimal cytotoxicity at low N:P ratios. The FA-conjugated polyplex showed higher transfection efficiency and cellular internalization in the folate receptor-overexpressing gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901 than a non-FA-conjugated polyplex. Subsequently, we adopted the targeted FA-PEG-SS-PEI-SPION/siRNA polyplexes at an N:P ratio of 10 for function studies. Cellular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that the polyplex could also act as a T2-weighted contrast agent for cancer MRI. Furthermore, one of four PD-L1 siRNAs exhibited effective PD-L1 knockdown in PD-L1-overexpressing SGC-7901. To determine the effects of the functionalized polyplex on T-cell function, we established a coculture model of activated T cells and SGC-7901 cells and demonstrated changes in secreted cytokines. Our findings highlight the potential of this class of multifunctional theranostic nanoparticles for effective targeted PD-L1-knockdown therapy and MRI diagnosis in gastric cancers.",

Properties of the MoO3 films were studied by DSC-TG, XRD, AFM, and FTIR. The effect of annealing temperature on the properties were discussed. MoO3 was crystallized (α-MoO3) with preferred (0k0) orientation when annealed at 250°C. During annealing, the microstructure of the MoO3 films changes, the absorption of the corner-sharing mode in the films increases, and the peak shifts to a lower wave number. These are attributed to a change of MoO3 particle shape and the state of aggregation of the particles in the films as well as the formation of strained bonds.",

The microstructure and wear resistance of the amorphous coatings are comparatively studied. The wear volume loss of the AC-HVAF coating is approximately seven times less than that of the HVOF coating, indicating that the AC-HVAF coating exhibits better wear resistance. Detailed analysis on the worn surface indicates that the enhanced wear resistance of the AC-HVAF coating is mainly attributed to the formation of a more stable oxide tribolayer and smoother worn surface, which result from the dense and complete amorphous microstructure of the AC-HVAF coating. The wear mechanism of the amorphous coatings is dominated by oxidation wear.",

        "abstract": "Oxidation resistance is one of key properties of titanium aluminide (TiAl) based alloys for high-temperature applications such as in advanced aero-engines and gas turbines. A new TiAlNbCr alloy with micro-addition of yttrium has been developed, but its oxidation behavior is unknown. To provide some fundamental insights, high-temperature oxidation characteristics of this alloy are examined via scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis, and X-ray diffraction. We show that distinctive core-multishell globular oxidation and “daisy” flower-like oxidation occur exclusively around Y2O3 particles. Globular oxides exhibit multi-layered Y2O3/TiO2/Al2O3-rich/TiO2-rich shell structures from the inside to outside. Flower-like inner oxides consist of core Y2O3 particles surrounded by divergent Al2O3 and oxygen-rich α2-Ti3Al in the near-scale substrate. As the scale-substrate interface moves inward, the inner oxide structures suffer deeper oxidation and transform into the globular oxide structures. Our results demonstrate that the unique oxidation characteristics and the understanding of formation mechanisms pave the way for the exploration and development of advanced oxidation-resistant TiAl-based materials.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This study investigated the principle of multidirectional isothermal forging (MDIF) and determined the major microstructural evolution features and unique room-temperature mechanical properties of extra-low interstitial-grade Ti–6Al–4V alloy. The grain refinement mechanism, grain boundary characteristics, and phase transformation during MDIF were explored. After three-step MDIF, a homogeneous microstructure with a grain size of about 0.5 µm was produced. The ultrafine grained Ti–6Al–4V alloy exhibited high yield strength (1170 MPa), high ultimate tensile strength (1190 MPa), and good ductility (10.4%). The mechanism of grain refinement during MDIF included continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) and discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX). Grain subdivision resulted from CDRX or the transformation of cellular dislocation substructures into new ultrafine grains. The necklace of new DDRX grains formed along the initial grain boundaries of the Ti–6Al–4V alloy. The main strengthening mechanisms were grain boundary and dislocation strengthening. The strength and grain size followed the typical Hall–Petch relationship.",

Nanocrystalline precipitates, mainly consisting of Ni3Zr and Ni42Zr 58 phases, appear from the amorphous matrix when annealed at 743 K for different times, and the size of the precipitates increases with the increasing of the annealing time. High strain rate compression experiments were been also performed to test the fully amorphous and annealed Zr-based BMG samples. The dynamic fracture strengths of the tested samples firstly increase with the increasing of the annealing time, and reach the maximum value for the case of annealed for 90 min.

        "abstract": "Huge collections of data have been created in recent years. Cloud computing provides a way to enable massive amounts of data to work together as data-intensive services. Considering Big Data and the cloud together, which is a practical and economical way to deal with Big Data, will accelerate the availability and acceptability of analysis of the data. Providing an efficient mechanism for optimized data-intensive services will become critical to meet the expected growth in demand. Because the competition is an extremely important factor in the marketplace, the cost model for data-intensive service provision is the key to provide a sustainable service market. As data play the dominant role in execution of data-intensive service composition, the cost and access response time of data sets influence the quality of the service that requires the data sets. In this paper, a data replica selection optimization algorithm based on an ant colony system is proposed. The performance of the data replica selection algorithm is evaluated by simulations. The background application of the work is the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer experiment, which involves large amounts of data being transferred, organized and stored. It is critical and challenging to be cost and time aware to manage the data and services in this intensive research environment.",

        "abstract": "This paper reviewed over 150 articles on the subject of the effect of contamination on PEM fuel cell. The contaminants included were fuel impurities (CO, CO 2 , H 2 S, and NH 3 ); air pollutants (NO x , SO x , CO, and CO 2 ); and cationic ions Fe 3+ and Cu 2+ resulting from the corrosion of fuel cell stack system components. It was found that even trace amounts of impurities present in either fuel or air streams or fuel cell system components could severely poison the anode, membrane, and cathode, particularly at low-temperature operation, which resulted in dramatic performance drop. Significant progress has been made in identifying fuel cell contamination sources and understanding the effect of contaminants on performance through experimental, theoretical/modeling, and methodological approaches. Contamination affects three major elements of fuel cell performance: electrode kinetics, conductivity, and mass transfer. This review was focused on three areas: (1) contamination impacts on the fuel cell performance, (2) mechanism approaches dominated by modeling studies, and (3) mitigation development. Some future work on fuel cell contamination research is suggested in order to facilitate the move toward commercialization.",

        "abstract": "Angiogenesis of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) is required in the functional restoration of brain injury, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and ischemic stroke. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an angiogenic molecule that functions through the formation of the FGF21/FGFR1/β-klotho complex but does not cause carcinogenic events. The current study was to determine whether recombinant human FGF21 (rhFGF21) could promote angiogenesis and scratch wound healing of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) and the possible underlying mechanism. rhFGF21 promoted angiogenesis and migration of HBMECs. The FGFR1 inhibitor PD173074 was applied to demonstrate that rhFGF21 functions through the formation of FGF21/FGFR1/β-klotho complexes. In addition, the specific PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 and PPARγ activator rosiglitazone were applied to determine that the role of rhFGF21 in increasing angiogenesis is through the PPARγ pathway. In addition, we revealed that the effect of rhFGF21 acts partially through upregulating eNOS expression. In conclusion, our study provides novel evidence that rhFGF21 can enhance the angiogenesis and migration of HBMECs through the formation of the FGF21/FGFR1/β-klotho complex via PPARγ activation and eNOS upregulation, indicating that FGF21 is a potential therapeutic angiogenic agent for the treatment of human brain injury.",

Sequential fat-suppressed T2-weighted imaging and quantitative T2 measurements were obtained at 3, 7, 14 and 21 days after surgery, with histologic assessments performed at regular intervals. T2 relaxation times and histological quantification of the distal stumps were measured and compared.The distal stumps of transected nerves treated with LPS or PBS both showed persistent enlargement and hyperintense signal. T2 values of the distal stumps showed a rapid rise to peak level followed by a rapid decline pattern in nerves treated with LPS, while exhibiting a slow rise to peak value followed by a slow decline in nerves treated with PBS. Nerves treated with LPS exhibited more prominent macrophage recruitment, faster myelin debris clearance and more pronounced nerve regeneration.Nerves treated with TLR4 activation had a characteristic pattern of T2 value change over time. Longitudinal T2 measurements can be used to detect the enhanced repair effect associated with TLR4 activation in the surgical repair of neurotmesis.• TLR4 activation had additional beneficial effects on neurotmesis beyond surgical repair. • TLR4 activation had a characteristic time course of T2 values. • T2 measurements can help detect beneficial effects with TLR4 activation.",

        "title": "Optical absorption edge evolution of vanadium pentoxide films during lithium intercalation",
        "abstract": "The influence of lithium intercalation on the optical absorption of vanadium pentoxide films is reported in this paper. Thin films were prepared by thermal evaporation followed by annealing in air. Lithium was inserted electrochemically so that Li x V 2 O 5 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.54) was obtained. The pristine and lithium inserted films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical spectroscopy, and ellipsometry. The optical absorption coefficient was calculated from measured normal transmittance and reflectance spectra. XRD analysis has shown that the as-grown V 2 O 5 films were amorphous, becoming microcrystal after annealing at 350 °C. The optical absorption spectra of all the samples exhibited two distinct regions of behavior: at high-energy where ( αhν ) 1/2 varied linearly with the photonic energy hν , and a low-energy tail. The blue shift of the optical absorption edge is attributed to the Fermi level going into the conduction band after lithium insertion, and the relation between the change of the optical gap and the inserted electron concentration is interpreted in terms of a Burstein–Moss shift. The results confirm that the anodic electrochromism of V 2 O 5 thin films is due to the blue shift of the absorption edge, and the near-infrared cathodic electrochromism arises from absorption of small polarons in V 2 O 5 . Keywords Vanadium oxide Optical properties Evaporation 1 Introduction Vanadium pentoxide films are of increasing interest due to their unique feature such as electro-chemical activity, high stability, high specific energy, high energy density, and high capacity as well as special layer structure. Therefore they are regarded as a promising candidate amongst the cathode active materials for electrochromic devices as well as for lithium secondary batteries, and for photo-catalysis and photovoltaics [1–5] . There are many methods, such as evaporation [6] , sputtering [7] , sol–gel process [8] , and chemical vapor deposition [9] , used to prepare V 2 O 5 films. Their structure, electrochemical, electrochromic, and optical properties, as well as influence of experimental conditions, have been extensively studied. Green and Pita [10] have studied the quantitative influence of lithium intercalation on the optical absorption of vanadium pentoxide films. However, further understanding an evolution of the optical absorption edge for vanadium pentoxide films during lithium intercalation has attracted theoretical importance in the electron state structure of the lithiated vanadium pentoxide. In this paper, V 2 O 5 thin films were prepared by the thermal evaporation of V 2 O 5 powder. Li x V 2 O 5 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.54) films were obtained using lithium electrochemical intercalation. The films were characterized by XRD, optical absorption, and ellipsometry. The optical absorption properties of the pristine and lithiated vanadium pentoxide films were investigated. Finally, the electronic state and absorption mechanism of the lithium inserted films are discussed. 2 Experimental details Vanadium pentoxide films were prepared by the vacuum evaporation of 99.99% pure V 2 O 5 powder using a resistively heated molybdenum boat positioned 25 cm below the substrate. The ITO (In 2 O 3 :Sn) coated and uncoated optical glass substrates had been chemically and ultrasonically cleaned. The apparatus was a vacuum system (the pressure lower than 1 × 10 −3 Pa) equipped with an oil diffusion pump backed by a mechanical pump. The evaporation rate was monitored by a quartz crystal oscillator and was kept at about 0.5 nm/s. In order to obtained uniformity of film thickness, the substrates must be revolved during deposition at a required speed. Then the samples were taken out of the chamber and annealed in an oven at 350 °C in an O 2 atmosphere. The temperature was automatically measured and controlled by a thermocouple; its accuracy is ± 1 °C. V 2 O 5 films were lithiated in a two-electrode electrochemical cell containing an electrolyte consisting of 1 M LiClO 4 in propylene carbonate (PC). The reagent grade LiClO 4 was dried under vacuum, and PC was distilled also under vacuum. The films with a 2.55 cm 2 active area served as working electrode in this cell, and Pt as the counterelectrode. A constant electrolysis current of 100 μA was used, and the amount of inserted charges was controlled by time. The cell was operated under dry condition in a glove box. Using the method of Talledo and Granqvist [11] , the quantity of lithium insertion–given as x in Li x V 2 O 5 –was derived from the known dimension of the films and the amount of intercalated charges, and assuming that the annealed films had the same density as the bulk of V 2 O 5 (3.357 g/cm 3 ). XRD patterns were obtained for samples using a Phillips PW170 X-ray diffractometer with CuK α radiation. The normal transmittance and reflectance spectra were recorded with a spectrophotometer (UV-4000, Hitachi), and a fresh Al mirror was used as the reference. Thickness of the films was determined by a Tencor Alpha Step instrument with a resolution of 2 nm and an accuracy of 5%. 3 Results and discussion The as-grown films had a slight green tint. After the films were annealed in an O 2 atmosphere at 350 °C for 20 min, the films had a characteristic yellow appearance, like V 2 O 5 powder. X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that the as-grown films are amorphous, while the post-treated samples have some diffraction peaks as shown in Fig. 1 corresponding to the orthorhombic V 2 O 5 , but the peaks are very weak, indicating that the films have a microcrystalline structure. This phenomenon has been observed by other researchers on sputtered [12,13] and sol–gel derived [14,15] V 2 O 5 films. Fig. 2 gives transmittance spectra of the pristine and lithiated V 2 O 5 films in the near-ultraviolet and visible region. It can be seen that the transmittance in the near-ultraviolet region changed strongly with the increase of the amount of intercalated lithium. At the wavelength of 400 nm, for example, the transmittance increases from 6.1% to 55.0% with the intercalated lithium x from 0 to 0.54, while the transmittance at 570 nm is kept almost unchanged. On the other hand, the transmittance in the near-infrared region has a slight change with the increase of intercalated lithium. For example, it has a change of about 14.1% at 700 nm when the amount of the intercalated lithium ranges from 0 to 0.54. All these have revealed that V 2 O 5 films have a double electrochromic effect. In the near-ultraviolet region, the films show an anodic electrochromic effect and, in the near-infrared region, a cathodic effect. This is in good agreement with that reported by Cogan et al. [2] . Fig. 3 presents the absorption spectra deduced from the optical reflectance and transmittance of the films in the 300–1000 nm wavelength region. It can be seen remarkably that the optical absorption edge E g of the films shifts to a shorter wavelength when the lithiated amount increases, showing a wider optical absorption gap of the lithiated V 2 O 5 films. Also the films gave a strong optical absorption in the range of wavelength at about 750 nm compared with the pristine V 2 O 5 films. This behavior is accompanied with a color change of the films. A similar shift in the absorption edge was observed in both sol–gel derived and sputtered V 2 O 5 films [7,16,17] . In order to understand an evolution of the energy band structure of V 2 O 5 films during lithium intercalation, optical absorption coefficient has been calculated as shown in Fig. 4 . It can be observed that there are two regions: in the higher energy region ( αhν ) 1/2 , a linear change with an increase of the photonic energy hν ; and in the lower energy region, there is a tail with strong optical absorption, especially for the lithiated V 2 O 5 films. Moreover, the absorption increases with increasing x in Li x V 2 O 5 . Meanwhile, the photonic energy at the intersection between the two regions moves to a higher energy after intercalating lithium. The absorption in the two regions may be attributed to the two different absorption mechanisms discussed as follows. To estimate the optical band gap E g , the absorption coefficient has been analyzed in terms of the relation: α ⁢ h ⁢ ν = B ( E − E g ) n where B is a constant. The Tauc plot ( n = 2), corresponding to an indirect transition, is shown in Fig. 5 . Extrapolating the line to photonic energy hν axis, the optical absorption edge E g is obtained. From the figure, it can be found that E g is 2.03 eV for the pristine V 2 O 5 films, and E g increases with increasing x , ranging from 2.03 eV to 2.62 eV when x increases from 0 to 0.54. For the pristine V 2 O 5 films, the obtained E g is quite reasonable because the E g of V 2 O 5 is dependent on the experimental conditions and preparation methods, usually between 1.90 and 2.18 eV calculated by Parker et al. [18] , Aita et al. [19] , and Benmoussa et al. [20] . On the other hand, the shift of the optical absorption edge to a lower wavelength has been confirmed by Cogan et al. [2] and Benmoussa et al. [7] after lithium ions and electrons insert into V 2 O 5 films. The widening of the optical absorption gap of the lithiated V 2 O 5 films can be explained based on the semiconductor model. Fig. 6 shows the energy band scheme [10,11,18] of V 2 O 5 . The conduction band (CB) is split two energy bands, and the energy gap between the lower and higher band is about 0.6 eV. The electron transition between the two parts of the CB is partly forbidden [21] . The lower band, split-off band, has a V 3d xy and V 3d yz character [10,18] . Therefore the narrowest optical gap is about 2.0 eV, where electrons transit from the top of the valence band (VB) to the split-off band [18] . The Fermi level is located somewhere in the midregion of the optical absorption gap for the pristine V 2 O 5 . After insertion of electrons and lithium ions into the V 2 O 5 films, the electron concentration n e in the films increases. When n e is small, the Fermi level is located below the conducting band. With increasing electron concentration, n e , the Fermi level moves up to near the bottom of the conduction band. When the electron concentration n e is larger than a critical value N c , the Fermi level enters into the conduction band [22] . The critical value N c can be estimated using the Mott criterion [22] : N c 1 / 3 a 0 * ≈ 0.25 where a 0 * is the effect Bohr radius, given by the expression a 0 * = h 2 ɛ 0 ɛ M /π e 2 m c *; here h is Plank's constant, ɛ 0 is the permittivity of the free space, ɛ M is the static dielectric constant of the host lattice, e is the charge of the electron, and m c *, the effective mass, can be obtained from the equation ɛ inf m c * = 1.4 m , where ɛ inf is the optical dielectric constant, and m is the electron rest mass. For V 2 O 5 , using the data from the value reported by Parker et al. [18] , the calculated N c is about 2.3 × 10 19 /cm 3 . When the electron concentration n e is larger than N c , the Fermi level lies in the conduction band. In the circumstances, the Fermi level can be expressed as ( h 2 /8π 2 m c *) K F 2 , where K F is the magnitude of the wave vector. At the Fermi level, it is (3π 2 n e ) 1/3 . For the high electron concentration n e above the critical value N c , the optical absorption gap widens because of the above shift of the Fermi level. Then the optical gap can be written as [22] : E g = E g 0 + Δ E g BM where E g0 is the optical gap for the pristine V 2 O 5 , and Δ E g BM is the Burstein–Moss (BM) shift, and is expressed as Δ E g BM = ( h 2 /8π 2 m νc *)(3π 2 n e ) 2/3 ; here the effective mass m νc * satisfies the expression: ( m νc *) −1 = ( m c *) −1 + ( m ν *) −1 . Experimentally, a constant current of 100 μA was injected into the V 2 O 5 thin film samples. When the inserted lithium x is 0.0021, the electron concentration n e just equals the critical value N c . Therefore, the Fermi level has entered into the conduction band in the studied range of the inserted lithium amount. Fig. 7 gives the relation between the inserted electron concentration and the BM shift. It can be found that they are very well satisfied with a line that is consistent with the Burstein–Moss theory. Theoretically, the band-gap widening is not only attributed to the Burstein–Moss effect [22] . According to the semiconductor theory, the amount Δ E g (= E g − E g0 ) of the band-gap widening upon insertion of lithium ions and electrons can be written as [22] : Δ E g = Δ E g BM + Δ ⁢ E ′ = Δ E g BM + h ∑ c ( k F , ω ) − h ∑ ν ( k F , ω ) where Δ E g BM means the Burstain–Mott shift, which is due to a blocking of the lowest states in the conduction band and hence a widening of E g [22,23] , while Δ E ′ is attributed to electron interaction and impurity, which tend to decrease the band-gap [22] . Green and Pita [10] gave a reasonable explanation about the latter. They thought there are two reasons. The first is due to interactions between lithium ions and the host lattice, which modifies the vanadium–oxygen bonding and must therefore modify the value of the main gap energy, although it is very weak. The second is due to the electrons accompanying lithium ion insertion and also interaction with the host lattice. However, the experimental results given by Green and Pita [10] also showed that the band-gap widening is almost directly proportional to the lithium ion inserted (amount x , when x is less than 0.55). That is in excellent agreement with our results. Therefore, it is reasonably supposed that electron interaction and impurity interaction are much weak, which means that Δ E ′ is much small; thus the BM shift mainly governs the band-gap widening when amount x of the inserted lithium ions is small. The absorption tail in the low photonic energy region has been also observed by Luksich and Aita [13] and Benmoussa et al. [20] . The absorption tail is attributed to charge defects in the films which are caused by impurities [19,20] . When the concentration of the impurity is very low, the absorption tail cannot be found clearly. After the concentration increases, the delocalization of charges happens due to the interaction between the adjacent impure charges. Thus, the flat strong absorption tail occurs [24] . In our experiment, the highly pure V 2 O 5 powder was used as the evaporation source material and the thermal evaporation was performed in a high vacuum system; there should be no other elements in the film. Moreover, Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) analyses [30] indicated that there are only O and V elements in the pristine V 2 O 5 films, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements [30] revealed that V atoms are not only in + 5 valence state, but also in + 4 valence state. These were also found by Luksich and Aita [13] and Salvi et al. [26] . Those V 4+ ions may arise from vanadyl O vacancies and/or the general disorder of the amorphous structure for the pristine films. Luksich and Aita [13] also confirmed that in the case of crystalline V 2 O 5 , V 4+ sites were created during growth, concurrent with creating vanadyl O vacancies, and for the amorphous materials, V 4+ sites arise possible from the general disorder even for amorphous, stoichiometric V 2 O 5 films. Therefore, the absorption tail results from V 4+ self-impurities. The research on optical properties of sputtered V 2 O 5 films reported by Luksich and Aita [13] has also confirmed the phenomenon. They found that the absorption coefficient is about 10 4 cm − 1 and that the low energy absorption tail disappears, attributed to the elimination of V 4+ . On the other hand, the semiconducting behavior of the amorphous vanadium pentoxide arises from hopping of electrons between V atoms in + 5 and + 4 valence states [13] . Therefore the absorption tail is assigned to polaron transition therein [25] . Electrons and lithium ions intercalated into the V 2 O 5 matrix can be expressed as: V 2 O 5 + x Li+ xe ⇔Li x V 2 O 5 Meanwhile it is well known that a change in the valence state of vanadium has taken place [6,26,27] (e.g., V 5+ + e →V 4+ ). Therefore upon insertion of electrons and ions, the concentration of V 4+ in the lithiated V 2 O 5 films increases. Thus the absorption tail increases as shown in Fig. 3 . In fact, the absorption tail in the lithiated V 2 O 5 films arises from polarons which move from V 4+ to V 5+ sites by absorbing photons. Electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) by Pecuenard et al. [28] has given clear evidence that the α-Li x V 2 O 5 structure produces polarons including bound ones trapped on four vanadium sites around the Li + ions and free polarons around a single vanadium site. Also the polarons in the Na a V 2 O 5 structure [29] have been confirmed. All these polarons contribute to the optical absorption in the low energy tail. Furthermore it has been found experimentally that the peak of the polaron absorption resulting from the electron transition from V 4+ sites to V 5+ sites ranges from the visible region to the near-infrared region [25] . This is consistent with our results. 4 Conclusions It can be concluded that as-grown V 2 O 5 films are amorphous and became microcrystal after annealing at 350 °C. The optical absorption spectra of all the samples exhibit two distinct regions of behavior: firstly, at high energy where ( αhν ) 1/2 varied linearly with the photonic energy hν , and, secondly, a low-energy tail. The blue shift of the optical absorption edge is attributed to the Fermi level going into the conducting band after lithium insertion, and the relation between the change of the optical gap and inserted electron concentration is well satisfied in terms of the Burstein–Moss shift. These results also confirm that the anodic electrochromism of V 2 O 5 thin films is due to a shift of the absorption edge, and the cathodic electrochromism arises from the absorption of small polarons in V 2 O 5 .

The sintered materials were examined by means of scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive spectrometer and hardness test. Experimental results show that the silicon addition can improve the densification of M3:2 steel sintered at 1230°C. The sintered density of M3:2 steel with silicon addition is higher than that without silicon addition, full density is obtained with silicon addition of 0.7 wt%. When the silicon addition is lower than 0.7 wt%, the addition of silicon decreases austenite content and increases hardness of the steel. But when the silicon content increases to 3.0 wt%, the microstructure of matrix transforms from austenite and martensite to pearlite which decreases the hardness. It is also found that compared to steel with silicon addition of 0.2 wt% and 0.7 wt%, M3:2 steel with 0.4 wt% Si shows a higher carbide content and small grain size.",

Thus, homogenous and refined grains with an average grain size of 1.6 µm were achieved. During three-directional compression, four type of twins were activated, namely, parallel     {  11   2   ¯    2  }     twins, parallel     {  10   1   ¯    2  }     twins, intersectional     {  10   1   ¯    2  }     twins and parallel     {  11   2   ¯    1  }     twins. In the first pass,     {  10   1   ¯    2  }    ,     {  11   2   ¯    1  }     and     {  11   2   ¯    2  }     twins were activated; in the second pass,     {  10   1   ¯    2  }     and     {  11   2   ¯    2  }     twins were activated; and in the third pass,     {  10   1   ¯    2  }     twins were activated. During hot compression, the dynamic recrystallization (DRX) process was divided into twin-active DRX stage and continuous DRX (CDRX) stage. In the first stage, the DRX mechanisms were twinning induced CDRX (TCDRX) and twinning induce DDRX (TDDRX) in parallel     {  11   2   ¯    2  }     twins, TCDRX and TDDRX in parallel     {  10   1   ¯    2  }     twins, TCDRX and intersectional twins induced DRX (ITDRX) in intersectional     {  10   1   ¯    2  }     twins and TCDRX in parallel     {  11   2   ¯    1  }     twins. Nine types of new texture components formed in this stage. In the last stage, the DRX mechanism was CDRX. The  a u003e basal slip,  a u003e pyramidal slip and 1st  c  +  a u003e pyramidal slip were the major deformation mechanisms during hot deformation.",

Experimental results indicate that the superplastic flow behaviors of the material, viz., the flow stress and the elongation depend strongly on the testing temperature and tensile rate. The elongation increases firstly and then decreases with increasing rate and the maximum elongation reaches 1625% at 656 K and 5 mm/min. The strain rate sensitivity exponents determined by using Backofen method are 0.25, 0.65 and 0.93 at 636, 656 and 676 K, respectively.

        "abstract": "The Kuqa depression is located in the middle segment of the southern Tianshan Mountains.There are four E-W extending rows of reverse fault and anticline zones in the depression. From the south Tianshan Mountains towards the Tarim basin, they are the mountain piedmont, the Kasangtuokai, the Qiulitag and the Yaken reverse fault and fold zones. The most recent active fold in this system is the Qiulitag fold belt. Dongqiulitag anticlinal zone belongs to east segment of Qiulitag reverse fault and fold zone. Comparing with other tectonic belts, new tectonic movement of the east segment is very strong. Research shows that dongqiulitag anticlinal is fault propagation-detachment mixed-fold, which results from effect of shallow detachment surface and reverse fault locating south of Dongqiulitag anticlinal. In the south of Dongqiulitag anticlinal, shallow reverse fault and deep ramp structure are important seismogenic locus. Back thrusting fault of shallow anticlinal core and kinking of the north wing of Dongqiulitag anticline belong to derivative secondary-structure. Size of the rupture and disturbance is finite. Latest activity of reverse fault, which locates south wing of the Dongqiulitag anticline, dislocated II terrace gravel layer. Activity date of the reverse fault is not less than earlier Holocene Epoch. The disturbance leaves paleoearthquake fractured trace behind in the ground surface, which is 3-4 kilometre. It shows that the rupture features of stick-slip movement.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic properties and magnetocaloric effects of La1-xR xFe11.5Si1.5 (R Pr, (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5); R Ce and Nd, (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.3)) compounds are investigated. Partially replacing La with R Ce, Pr and Nd in La1-xRxFe11.5Si 1.5 leads to a reduction in Curie temperature due to the lattice contraction. The substitution of R for La causes an enhancement in field-induced itinerant electron metamagnetic transition, which leads to a remarkable increase in magnetic entropy change ΔSm and also in hysteresis loss. However, a high effective refrigerant capacity RCeff is still maintained in La1-xRxFe11.5Si1.5. In the present samples, a large ΔSm and a high RCeff have been achieved simultaneously. © 2009 Chin.
