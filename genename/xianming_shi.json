Methods To sample 196 blood samples from three administrative villages belonging to plague natural foci formerly, and collect 100 blood samples from non-infected areas as the control. Indirect hemagglutination test(IHA) and colloedal gold immunobinding were used in this test. Results There were 4 positive among 196 blood samples, and the positive rate was 2.04%. There were 4 positive samples in IHA and 3 positive samples in colloedal gold immunobinding. The human serums collected from non-infected areas were all negative after tested by theses two methods. There was significant difference between the positive rate of F1 antibody in epidemic areas and the positive rate of F1 antibody in non-epidemic areas (\u03c72=0.822,P<0.05). Conclusion At present, there are still a number of F1 antibody positive population in the natural epidemic focus of Hebei, and it needs further investigation and analysis to clarify.",

By introducing the biochemical characteristics, nutritional needs, plasmid characteristics, virulence factors, virulence and toxins and other aspects, the study has concluded that Y. pestis isolated in Hebei province belongs to Group B of the Ordos Plateau, of which the nutritional needs are characterized by glycine semi-dependence and tryptophan dependence. These strains contain 4 kinds of plasmids, of which 13\u00d7106 plasmid is specifically carried by Meriones unguiculatus in the Inner Mongolian. Some strains lack the 45\u00d7106 plasmid, though all of isolates were F1 antigen and streptozotocin (Pst\u2160)-positive. However, only a certain portion of the strains were positive for pigmentation (Pgm) and VW antigen, indicating genetic instability and moderate toxicity.",

Methods: 190 samples of rodent serum specimens from plague focus in Kangbao county and plague surveillance region in Guyuan county, and 11 samples of rabbit serum immunized with Yersinia pestis were detected by means of GICA test, double antigens sandwich Enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (DAgS-ELISA) and indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) for antibodies against Yersinia pestis F1. Results: The F1 antibodies of 190 samples of rodent serum were negative detected by IHA test, there was 1 positive portion by GICA at a titer 1: 10; out of 3 positive portions by DAgS-ELISA test 2 were at a titer 1: 4 (++), 1 at 1: 16 (+). In 11 samples of rabbit serum going through the three tests, 9 were positive, with the sensitivity of GICA lower than that of IHA and ELISA (GICA vs IHA: t = 3.257, P < 0.05; GICA vs ELISA: t = 3.625, P < 0.01; IHA vs ELISA: t = 1.437, P > 0.05). The outcome of GICA was accordant with that of IHA test in a rate of 99.50% and with that of DAgS-ELISA test in a rate of 99.00%. There was no significant discrepancy (X2 = 0.5, P > 0.05) among the 3 methods. Conclusions: The GICA was sensitive, specific, practicable and rapid used for detection of F1 antibodies. Both the GICA and DAgS-ELISA are valuable techniques of early diagnosis and surveillance of plague.",

Secreting McAbs against F1Ag of Yersinia pestis. Methods: Balb/c mice of seven to nine weeks old were randomly divided into six groups. The first four groups were 150, 100, 50 and 25 \u03bcg F1Ag inoculated group, having multipoint hypodermic inoculation of F1Ag of 150, 100, 50 and 25 \u03bcg followed by multipoint hypodermic inoculation of F1Ag of 100 \u03bcg for a second time and then intraperitoneal injection of 100 \u03bcg. Next, hypodermically inoculated group received F1Ag of 100 \u03bcg for three times in multiple points. Finally, the intraperitoneal injection group was intraperitoneally inoculated with F1Ag of 100 \u03bcg for three times. Emulsification liquid of F1Ag + Complete Frednd's adjuvant (CFA) of equivalence was used in the first inoculation, emulsification liquid of F1Ag + Incomplete Frednd's adjuvant (IFA) balanced mix in the second, F1Ag liquid in the third. One week afterwards, tail blood of the mice was collected to test antibody titers of anti-F1Ag by double antigens sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (DAgS-ELISA) and trace indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA). Results: The levels of antibody of anti-F1Ag in 150, 100, 50 and 25 \u03bcg groups had statistics difference (DAgS-ELISA method: G = 12 173.87, 13 440.37, 15 024.19 and 4466.72, F = 3.11, P < 0.05; IHA: G = 19 972.32, 18 089.40, 23 170.47 and 4871.08, F = 4.11, P < 0.05). Immune effect of the 3 groups of 150, 100 and 50 \u03bcg was almost the same (P > 0.05), and excelled as compared with that in 25 \u03bcg group with statistics difference (DAgS-ELISA method: t = 2.18, 2.39, 2.73, P < 0.05; IHA: t = 2.54, 2.73, 3.13, P < 0.05). The titer of F1 antibody had an increasing trend from the 100 \u03bcg group to hypodermic group and intraperitoneal injection groups, but without statistics difference(DAgS-EUSA method: G = 8933.44, 9986.16, 13 440.37; IHA: G = 13 777.25, 16 384.00, 18 089.40, F = 0.66, 0.25, all P > 0.05). Conclusions: Hyodermical inoculation of FlAg with the first dose of 50 \u03bcg in multiple points for mouse is appropriate, and a strengthening dose of 100 \u03bcg in an intraperitoneal injection may shorten the immune period.",

        "abstract": "An approach of neural network was made on its application to the correlation between molecular electronic structure and corrosion inhibition properties of isoquinoline and its derivatives. It was indicated in a reference that the less the net charge and \u03c0 charge of N atom are, the higher the inhibition efficiency is, and the net charge of six atoms in pyridine ring increases. The inputs of neural networks were the molecular structure parameters, such as net charge and \u03c0 charge of N atom, which were obtained by means of HMO and CNDO/2 methods. The neural network's outputs included the corrosion-inhibition efficiencies of isoquinoline and its hydroxyl and carboxyl derivatives for iron electrode in HCl solution or electrode parameters which were determined with electrochemical methods in 1.0 mol\u00b7dm-3 HCl solution at 30\u00b0C. The corresponding relationship and modeling prediction were established by using the neural networks with 7-15-6, 7-5-5, and 9-10-6 topological structures that were trained beforehand by modified backpropagation (MBP) algorithm respectively. The learning precision was high and the predicting performance was excellent. With the trained neural network the corrosion inhibition properties or electrode parameters of some unknown isoquinoline's derivatives could be predicted quantitatively and the results were quite good.",

        "abstract": "The approach of neural networks was made on its applications to the correlation between molecular electronic structure and corrosion inhibition properties of aniline and its halogenated and methylated derivatives with substituents at different positions. It was found by reference [2] that there exists the relation between the inhibitive efficiency of the above compounds in acid media for mild steel and their electronic structures; and a tentative interpretation was given for the phenomenon that when the inhibitiors are substituted with the same kind of substituents at different positions in the molecule, or with different substituents at same position, they exhibit different inhibitive efficiency. The mechanism of corrosion, inhibition was also explained from the point of view of electron transfer and the information provided in that paper could be probably useful for developing new more effective inhibitors. The present authors believe that the molecules of the inhibitors were possibly adsorbed on the surface of iron electrode in horizontal state. The inputs of neural networks included the molecular structure parameters, such as hydrophobic index (\u03c0,\u03c0 -), molar refraction (MR), steric parameter (E s), electronic index (\u03c3,\u03c3*), as well as net charge and \u03c0 charge of N atom (qN), and low-unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which could be calculated by means of semi-empirical methods of quantum chemisty, including HMO and CNDO/2 methods. The neural network's outputs were the corrosion-inhibiting efficiencies of aniline and its halogenated and methylated derivatives for mild steel in acid media. The corresponding relationship and modelling prediction were established by using neural networks with 8-15-1 topological structures trained by a modified backpropagation (MBP) algorithm, respectively. The learning precision was high and the predicting performance was excellent. The corrosion inhibiting properties or electrode parameters of some new aniline's derivatives were predicted quantitatively and the results were quite good.",

        "abstract": "This work aims to improve the rutting and fatigue cracking resistance of asphalt binders using selected nano- or micro-sized materials and to shed light on the microstructure changes induced by such modification to asphalt binders. The four modifiers (Nanomer I.44P, carbon microfiber, non-modified nanoclay and polymer modified nanoclay) were added into the control asphalt binder (PG 58-34). The Superpave\u2122 tests and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements were conducted for obtaining the complex shear modulus G and microstructure distribution of modified asphalt binders. Meanwhile, the short-term and long-term aging processes of asphalt binders are simulated by rolling thin film oven (RTFO) and pressure aging vessel (PAV) tests. From the dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) and FTIR tests results, the complex shear modulus G values of nano- or micro-materials (Nanomer I.44P, non-modified nanoclay and carbon microfiber) modified asphalt binders increase, and the performance of resistance to rutting is improved compared to the control asphalt binder. The addition of polymer modified nanoclay (PMN) into the control asphalt binder decreases the complex shear modulus, and enhances the resistance to fatigue cracking. Moreover, the addition of four modifiers into the control asphalt binder can delay and weaken the aging and oxidation effect. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study is to evaluate the rheological properties and chemical bonding of nano-modified asphalt binders blended with nanosilica. In this study, the nanosilica was added to the control asphalt at contents of 4% and 6% based on the weight of asphalt binders. Superpave binder and mixture tests were utilized in this study to estimate the characteristics of the nano-modifed asphalt binder and mixture. The rotational viscosity (RV), dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), bending beam rhometer (BBR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), asphalt pavement analyzer (APA), dynamic modulus (DM) and flow number (FN) tests were used to analyze rheological properties and chemical bonding changes of the nano-modified asphalt binder and the performance of the nano-modified asphalt mixture. In addition, the performance of nano-modified asphalt after rolling thin-film oven (RTFO) short-term and pressure-aging vessel (PAV) long-term aging was assessed as well. The dissipated work per load cycle for the asphalt binder was used to evaluate the rheological properties of the nano-modified asphalt binder. Based on the binder test results, it was found that the additional nanosilica in the control asphalt binder slightly decreased the viscosity of the control asphalt binder, maintained low dissipated work per load cycle, held a similar low-temperature performance to the control asphalt, and had a positive effect on antioxidation. From the mixture test results, the dynamic modulus and flow number of nano-modified asphalt mixtures improved, and the rutting susceptibility of nano-modified asphalt mixtures was reduced compared to the control asphalt mixture. In general, the findings from this study show that the antiaging property and rutting and fatigue cracking performance of nanosilica modified asphalt binders are enhanced, and the addition of nanosilica in the control asphalt mixture significantly improves the dynamic modulus, flow number, and rutting resistance of asphalt mixtures. \u00a9 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

        "abstract": "In this accelerated laboratory study, several commercial products of surface treatment were included in the test program, including three concrete sealers, two crack sealants, and two water repellents. To characterize the product longevity under traffic, the abrasion resistance of concrete treated by each product was tested. To characterize the product effectiveness against salt scaling, the surface treated concrete cylinders were subjected to the joint action of 15 freeze/thaw and wet/dry cycles and exposure to a diluted deicer simulated by 3 wt.% NaCl solution. The mass loss of these concrete cylinders during the freeze/thaw cycles was periodically measured. For mechanistic investigation, the surface-treated concrete specimens were further tested for their water absorption rates, gas permeability, and water contact angle. For all the laboratory tests, the untreated concrete was used as control. The results confirmed the benefits of using these products to treat the surface of concrete against salt scaling, as all of them exhibited outstanding performance and reduced the mass loss of the concrete by 90% or more. Among them, two products (epoxy-based sealer T48CS and water repellent ATS-42) exhibited the best performance in protecting the concrete from salt scaling and featured the highest resistance to abrasion and generally lower water absorption rates and gas permeability coefficients. The results suggest that high resistance to both gas and water penetration is a crucial property in a good surface sealer, crack sealant or water repellent applied to concrete. ? 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

Our observations indicate that manganese biomineralization occurs in two steps: first, the divalent manganese (Mn 2+ ) is oxidized to manganese oxyhydroxide, MnOOH; then the MnOOH is further oxidized to manganese dioxide, MnO 2 . Both reactions contribute to an increase in the open circuit potential and hence to the ennoblement of the material.

        "abstract": "Drawing upon relevant literature, this work explores various dimensions of using chloride-based ice control products for winter maintenance operations. Winter maintenance operations play an important role in assuring the safety, mobility and productivity of roadways enduring wintery weather. Traditionally, nominal cost and effectiveness are the major criteria when highway professionals select the chemicals for snow and ice control. However, there are growing concerns over negative impacts that chloride-based ice control products pose on motor vehicles, the transportation infrastructure, and the environment. The authors propose that the use of chloride-based products for sustainable winter maintenance necessitates the application of a balanced perspective and collaborative decision-making among all relevant stakeholders. The shortcomings of existing maintenance decision systems are discussed, followed by a new way of thinking under the asset management framework. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "The formation of microcracks is a major concern for the integrity and durability of concrete and other cementitious composites,\n since such microcracks cannot be easily controlled and detected within the matrix of composite. This work explored the possibility\n of using surface-sulfonated polystyrene microspheres (SPSM) featuring an average diameter of 0.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0\u03bcm to improve the crack\n resistance of carbon microfiber-reinforced mortar. The compressive strength and EIS data demonstrated that the incorporation\n of SPSM at 0.15% by weight of cement led to a denser and more refined microstructure of the cement mortar composite, likely\n attributable to the active interactions between SPSM and cement hydration products as well as carbon microfibers. The crack\n resistance of these cement-based composites was evaluated using a non-destructive test under uniaxial compression loading\n along with a fatigue test under uniaxial compression cyclic loading. The data, in the form of critical stress, specific crack\n area, and fatigue strain, revealed that even at a small dosage the incorporation of SPSM to carbon microfiber-reinforced mortar\n retarded the initiation of unrecoverable microcracks and slowed down the propagation of microcracks under uniaxial compression\n loading, and improved the crack resistance and toughness of the specimens under fatigue loading.",

        "abstract": "The objectives of this study are to investigate the applicability of carbon micro-fiber and nanoclay in asphalt binders and to evaluate the performance of micro- and nano-modified asphalt (NMA) binders in terms of rheological properties. Due to their unique characteristics, micro- and nanomaterials were hypothesized to play a critical role in enhancing the performance behavior of asphalt binders. In light of existing research, carbon micro-fiber (MCF) and Nanomer I.44P (NI.44P) were selected as the micro- and nanomaterials for this research. Then, these materials were added into the PG 58-34 control asphalt binder at the concentrations of 2 % and 4 % by weight. SuperpaveTM binder tests-rotational viscosity (RV), dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), and bending beam rheometer (BBR)-were then conducted for evaluating the performance of each modified asphalt binder. Also, the characterization tests were run on the aged samples prepared using the rolling thin film oven (RTFO) and pressure aging vessel (PAV) to simulate the short-term and long-term aging. Subsequently, the viscosity, dynamic shear modulus (|G*|) and phase angle (d) of asphalt binders were analyzed, and the dissipated energy per load cycle was introduced to estimate the asphalt binders' rutting and fatigue cracking resistance. It was found that the dynamic shear modulus of asphalt binders can be improved by the selected micro- and nanomaterials. Furthermore, the NI.44P modified asphalt showed better properties relative to the other modified asphalt binders or the control (PG 58-34) binder. Copyright \u00a9 2013 by ASTM International.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new type of poly(dimethylsiloxane)/modified nano-silica (PDMS/modified nanosilica) hybrid superhydrophobic coating to reduce ice accumulation on insulators. The PDMS/modified nano-silica hybrid coating and a room temperature vulcanized (RTV) silicone rubber coating were formed on glass insulators for ice accumulation experiments in the laboratory. The hydrophobicity of the two coatings was measured and compared. Average water contact angle on the PDMS/modified nano-silica hybrid coating reached 161. The microstructures and functional groups on the surfaces of both coatings were investigated using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, respectively. Analysis results show that both multiscale microstructure and low surface energy contributed to the superhydrophobicity of the PDMS/modified nano-silica hybrid coating. Finally, experiments on ice accumulation on insulators were carried out to investigate the anti-icing properties of the PDMS/modified nano-silica hybrid coating on insulators. Significantly smaller rate of ice accumulation was observed for the insulators treated with the PDMS/modified nano-silica hybrid coating, relative to that treated with the RTV silicone rubber coating. \u00a9 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

        "abstract": "As chemicals are widely used for snow and ice control of highway and airfield pavements or aircrafts, recent years have seen increased concerns over their potentially detrimental effects on the surrounding environment. The abrasives used for winter operations on pavements are also a cause of environmental concerns. After some background information, this paper presents a review of the environmental impacts of chemicals used for snow and ice control, including those on: surface, ground, and drinking waters; soil; flora; and fauna. The paper provides a state-of-the-art survey of published work (with a focus on those in the last two decades) and examines mainly the impacts of abrasives, chlorides, acetates and formates, urea, glycols, and agro-based deicers. Finally, we conclude with a brief discussion of public perception of such impacts and best management practices (BMPs) to mitigate them.",

        "abstract": "This study investigated the rheological properties of asphalt binders modified with nanomaterial additives. The additives used are non-modified nanoclay (NMN) and polymer modified nanoclay (PMN). They were added to the control PG 58-34 asphalt binder at concentrations of 2% and 4% by the weight of the asphalt binder, respectively. Superpave\u2122 binder tests were employed to evaluate the characteristics of the nano-modified binders. Rheological properties of nano-modified asphalt were analyzed by use of asphalt binder tests such as Rotational Viscosity (RV), Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) and Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR). In addition, the short- and long-term aging properties of nano-modified asphalt were analyzed, with the aging process simulated by Rolling Thin Film Oven (RTFO) and the Pressure Aging Vessel (PAV). The dissipated work per load cycle of all asphalt binders was examined, in order to better understand the properties of nano-modified asphalt. The results reveal that both viscosity and complex shear modulus of asphalt binder remarkably increase when the NMN is added into the control asphalt, and decrease slightly when the PMN is added. In addition, from the dissipated work perspective, the overall performance of PMN modified asphalt binder is improved in terms of rutting and fatigue cracking resistance relative to the NMN modified asphalt binder. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this model, a \"structure factor\", \u03ba, defined as a function of the aspect ratio of the carbon filler, was first introduced to calculate the backbone density. To obtain the actual backbone density, carbon fiber (CF) reinforced cement composites with different CF concentrations were prepared and their DC electrical conductivities were measured. It was found that, when the CF concentration slightly exceeded the percolation threshold, the electrically conductive critical exponent was neither a universal value nor a constant that increases with the CF concentration. The results also indicated that the backbone density of the CF decreased with increasing CF concentration. The mechanisms of backbone structure evolution with increasing CF concentration were presented. The experimental results showed that near the percolation threshold the backbone density is approximately 0.15, which agrees well with the simulation results. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A single UPD Cu replacement with Pt(2+) produced a uniform Pt monolayer on the surface of gold nanoparticles, which are immobilized on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) surface based on electrostatic interaction. The ultrathin Pt@Au nanoparticles were confirmed by cyclic voltammetry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Voltammetry and amperometric methodologies were used to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt@Au nanoparticles modified electrode towards the reduction of hydrogen peroxide under the physiological condition. The present results show that ultrathin Pt coating greatly enhances the electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of hydrogen peroxide, which can be utilized to fabricate the hydrogen peroxide sensor. Chronoamperometric experiments showed that at an applied potential of 0.08 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), the current reduction of hydrogen peroxide was linear to its concentration in the range of 1-450 \u03bc\u039c, and the detection limit was found to be 0.18 \u03bcM (signal-to-noise ratio, S/N=3).",

The results demonstrated that both Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms were suitable for describing the adsorption characteristics of these materials. Among the four types of filter media tested, the cement-based mortar A has the highest value of maximum adsorption (30.96 mg g(-1)). The P-bonding energy (KL) and adsorption capacity (K) exhibited a positive correlation with the total content of Al2O3 and Fe2O3 in each mortar. The maximum amount of P adsorbed (Qm) and adsorption intensity (1/n) exhibited a positive correlation with the CaO content in each mortar. For three of them, the P-removal rates were in excess of 94 percent for phosphorus concentrations ranging from 20 to 1000 mg L(-1). The underlying mechanisms were examined using field emission scanning microscopy (FESEM), coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The results reveal that the removal of phosphate predominantly followed a precipitation mechanism in addition to weak physical interactions between the surface of adsorbent filter media and the metallic salts of phosphate. The use of cement-based or alternative cementitious materials in the form of ground powder shows great promise for developing a cost-effective and environmentally sustainable technology for P-sequestration and for wastewater treatment.",

        "abstract": "A novel kind of hybrid nanocomposites containing Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs) and Chitosan (CS) have been fabricated based on the PtNPs inserting into the porous structure of CS on the surface of glassy carbon electrode (GCE). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and several electrochemical techniques, such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), have been used to characterize PtNPs/CS modified electrode. Electrocatalytic experiments show that these uniform nanocomposites can greatly decrease the over-potential and increase the peak current in the methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction. In comparison with the results reported previously, the PtNPs-CS nanocomposites have excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of methanol and reduction of oxygen, which can be utilized to develop new fuel cell with high performance.

The glass plates were treated with 2,3-epoxy propoxy propyltrimethoxysilicane based on an epoxy-amine system in advance. Aggregates of fumed silica were found to be chemically bonded to the treated glass surfaces and a surface possessing dual micron- and nanoscale hierarchical structures was observed on the super-hydrophobic surfaces. The laboratory testing results showed that the obtained surfaces possessed long-term superhydrophobicity in air and maintained its super-hydrophobicity over a wide pH range. \u00a9 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

        "abstract": "This work experimentally investigates how continuous deicer exposure affects the strength and chemistry of Portland cement concrete, by ponding two types of concrete samples under four diluted chloride-based deicers respectively at room temperature for an average of 338 days. The two mix designs investigated represent the roadway pavements and bridge decks built by the Washington Department of Transportation (WSDOT) before 1980s respectively. For the pavement mix, the continuous exposure to three deicers (non-inhibited NaCl, inhibited NaCl and inhibited CaCl 2 deicer) led to limited levels of strength gain of the concrete, whereas that to the inhibited MgCl 2 led to significant strength loss. For the bridge mix, the continuous exposure to the four deicers led to significant strength loss of the concrete, with the inhibited CaCl 2 deicer being the least affected. These results suggest the deleterious role of Mg 2+ cations and the beneficial role of Ca 2+ cations in altering concrete strength, even though more concrete samples need to be tested in order to validate the findings. The FESEM/EDX data reveal that each investigated deicer chemically reacted with some of the cement hydrates and formed new products, with potential implications on concrete durability. Corrosion inhibitor and other additives in deicers did not show significant benefit in inhibiting the strength or chemical changes of concrete induced by cations and/or anions in deicers.",

This study sheds light on the challenges of developing a laboratory test that correlates to the field results and the results from the literature review and practitioner interviews may assist in developing a test method that would better mimic the actual deicer performance. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

Laboratory\n simulations of environmental freeze/thaw cycling were first conducted on Portland cement concrete specimens in the presence\n of various deicers (NaCl, K-formate, NaCl-based deicer, K-acetate-based deicer, Na-acetate/Na-formate blend deicer, CMA deicer,\n or MgCl2 liquid deicer); and SEM/EDX measurements were then conducted for the concrete samples. Under the experimental conditions\n in this study, the CMA solid deicer and the MgCl2 liquid deicer were benign to the concrete durability, whereas K-formate and the Na-acetate/Na-formate blend deicer showed\n moderate amount of weight loss and noticeable deterioration of the concrete. NaCl, the NaCl-based deicer, and the K-acetate-based\n deicer were the most deleterious to the concrete. In addition to exacerbating physical distresses, each investigated chemical\n or diluted deicer chemically reacted with some of the cement hydrates and formed new products in the pores and cracks. Such\n physiochemical changes of the cement paste induced by the deicers pose various levels of risks for the concrete durability.",

Asphalt mixtures were prepared with various amount of nanoclay and/or carbon microfiber, and compacted using the Superpave\u2122 gyratory compactor. Moisture susceptibility and deicer impacts were assessed by exposing the samples to water or deicing chemicals (NaCl, MgCl 2 and CaCl 2 ), and seven freeze\u2013thaw cycles, in a modified AASHTO T283 test. Comparisons of micro- or nano-modified asphalt mixtures exposed to deicers are made based on results of indirect tensile strength tests, which preliminarily demonstrate the great potential of using microfibers and nanoclays in asphalt mixture for improved performance. Based on the results, it was found that the addition of nanoclay and carbon microfiber would improve a mixture\u2019s moisture susceptibility performance or decrease the moisture damage potential in most cases. The detailed effects of deicing solutions on the tensile strength of micro- or nano- modified asphalt mixture are discussed in this paper.",

        "title": "Managing airport stormwater containing deicers: challenges and opportunities",
        "abstract": "Stormwater runoff at airports is a significant and costly issue, especially for the stormwater laden with deicing contaminants of high Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and aquatic toxicity. To reduce the loading of deicing constituents in stormwater and to manage the increasing pressure of tightening regulations, identifying fate and transport and evaluating environmental risks of deicing stormwater are of critical importance. In this review, the regulatory development of airport deicing stormwater management was first discussed, along with the milestone Airport Cooperative Research Program (ACRP) Report 14 publication. The deicer usage and fugitive losses can be reduced and the amount of deicer collected can be increased by having a better understanding of the fate and transport of deicing constituents in stormwater. As such, an overview and evaluation of the constituents of concern in deicers were provided to support the assessment of environmental impacts and mitigation recommendations. The state of knowledge of airport deicing stormwater management was then reviewed, which needs to be synthesized into a national guidance document. A guidebook and a decision tool for airports were proposed to adopt specific practical stormwater management strategies while balancing their priorities in environmental, economic, and social values against operational constraints. These challenges pose great opportunities to improve the current practices of airport deicing stormwater management.",

        "abstract": "Surface transportation in the U.S. is constantly threatened by the capricious character of weather. Improving the quality and accessibility of road and weather information may benefit a wide spectrum of weather data users. This paper presents a case study known as the proof-of-concept WeatherShare, an integrated, user-friendly surface transportation weather system for northern California. The goal of WeatherShare is to streamline and integrate currently available road weather data into one single source easily accessible by incident responders and potentially the traveling public, including those from Caltrans Road Weather Information Systems (RWIS), California Data Exchange Center, National Weather Service, among other providers in the region. To guide the system design and development, a Concept of Operations (ConOps) was developed to: 1) document the existing system; 2) identify the high-level needs to be addressed; 3) provide a conceptual overview of the desired system; 4) define users and operational scenarios of the proposed system; 5) present operational impacts of the proposed system; and 6) analyze advantages of the proposed system. This work demonstrates an innovative approach to developing a regional pilot weather information system, in which a systems engineering approach was used to incorporate stakeholder input and feedback throughout the iterative development process. \u00a9 2012 American Society of Civil Engineering.",

However, the cost of such activities is such a major outlay that it demands close scrutiny. There is a need to understand better and quantitatively estimate the benefits of winter road maintenance. Therefore, the work discussed in this paper was undertaken to quantitatively assess the benefits of winter highway operations at the state level. Methodologies were developed to estimate the major benefits of winter maintenance, including safety improvements, travel time savings, and fuel savings. A Minnesota case was used to demonstrate the methodologies and quantify those benefits. Results of the case study showed the benefits of winter highway maintenance by the Minnesota Department of Transportation to be $227 million per winter season, with $168 million of safety benefits, $11 million of mobility benefits, and $48 million of fuel savings. The benefit-cost ratio of winter highway operations in Minnesota was 6.2, in which material costs were taken into account.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThis work reports the laboratory performance of five film-forming sealers that protect concrete from deicer scaling (15 freeze-thaw and wet-dry cycles in diluted NaCl or MgCl2 solution). Regardless of the presence or type of sealer, no apparent scaling occurred on the concretes exposed to 2.54% by weight MgCl2 solution, but there was significant reduction in their splitting tensile strength (up to 55% for the nontreated concrete). The best-performing sealer in mitigating this risk of strength reduction was the methyl methacrylate (MMA) polymer. For the concrete exposed to 3% by weight NaCl solution, the scaling resistance and ability of strength preservation were significantly improved by the presence of a sealer. Regardless of the sealer type, the initial rate of water absorption of surface-treated concretes was greatly reduced by the sealer by at least 68%. The water absorption behavior of the sealer-treated concrete showed a strong correlation with mass loss caused by salt scaling. The concrete...",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe use of deicers in cold regions has raised many concerns regarding their negative impacts on the durability of concrete infrastructure. Numerous studies have been conducted in the laboratory settings with respect to the chemical and physical deterioration of concrete as a function of deicer type. However, little research has been done with concrete structures in the field, especially concrete bridge decks whose durability is also affected by temperature cycling and mechanical loadings. In this study, the effects of sodium chloride (NaCl) and potassium acetate (KAc) deicers were investigated using concrete samples obtained from the field bridge deck coring and those prepared in the laboratory. The relevant tests of both the field-cored and laboratory-fabricated concrete samples revealed that the two deicers (NaCl and KAc) imposed negative impact on the durability of the concrete materials. To compare the practical implications of these two deicers on concrete, their ice-melting capacity was test...",

The first part of this study evaluates the effectiveness of salt remover for washing bare metals. A dip-dry test was employed to simulate the field conditions. Carbon steel (C1010), aluminum alloy (Al1100), and stainless steel (SS304L) were used in the test program to evaluate the use of water, soapy water, and a commercial salt remover in washing practices. The corrosion behavior of metals was studied using linear polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. Digital photos and scanning electron microscopy revealed the surface morphology of corrosion coupons. The salt remover could significantly enhance the corrosion resistance of carbon steel and stainless steel in a 30%-by-weight MgCl2 solution, but not that of the aluminum alloy. Further investigation focused on the evaluation of an innovative sugar beet by-product for ...",

        "abstract": "AbstractAgro-based products and complex chlorides/minerals (CCM) based products are increasingly employed in snow and ice control operations, either used alone or more commonly as additives for chloride-based products. Recent studies have shown that agro-based or CCM-based products have the potential to improve the overall deicing and/or anti-icing performance and reduce the corrosion and environmental risks. However, the effectiveness of such products has been limited to qualitative field observations, and their specific role in snow and ice control is poorly understood. This work consists of a systematic laboratory investigation, which focuses on the thermal properties, ice melting behavior, and corrosivity of four agro-based deicers and two CCM based deicers. First, CCM-based deicers do not exhibit significantly better ability to lower the freezing point of water when compared with NaCl, but they feature slightly better ice melting capacity at \u22129.4\u00b0C (15\u00b0F) than NaCl. Second, agro-based additives appea...",

This study examined and elucidated the effect of GO on the hydration products of cement system in detail. The hydration precursors, morphology, composition, and chemical bonds of cement pastes were studied by SEM/BSE, TGA, XRD, LA-ICP-MS, and  29 Si/ 27 Al MAS-NMR, respectively. The experimental results indicated that the 28-day compressive strength of cement pastes (w/c = 0.35) was increased by 29% when admixing 0.03 wt.% GO. There existed chemical reaction between the admixed GO and the cement hydration products. The improved strength actually was not only attributed to the improved hydration degree of cement, but also the newly found tobermorite-like hydrates and jennite-like hydrates due to the Ca ions consumption by the negatively charged GO. The polymerization of hydration products was also improved due to the addition of GO.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The use of chemicals for snow and ice control operations is a common practice for improving the safety and mobility of roadways in cold climate, but brings significant concerns over their risks including the corrosive effects on transportation infrastructure and motor vehicles. The vast majority of existing studies and methods to test the deicer corrosivity have been restricted to laboratory environments and unstressed metals, which may not reliably simulate actual service conditions. As such, we report a case study in which stainless steel SS 304 (unstressed and externally tensile stressed), aluminum (Al 1100) and low carbon steel (C1010) coupons were exposed to 25% MgCl 2  under field conditions for six weeks. A new corrosion test-bed was developed in Montana to accelerate the field exposure to this deicer. To further investigate the observed effect of tensile stress on the corrosion of stainless steel, SS 304 (unstressed and externally stressed) coupons were exposed to 25% MgCl 2  solution under the laboratory conditions. The C 1010 exhibited the highest percentage of rust area and suffered the most weight loss as a result of field exposure and MgCl 2  sprays. In terms of ultimate tensile strength, the Al 1100 coupons saw the greatest reduction and the unstressed and externally stressed SS 304 coupons saw the least. The ability of MgCl 2  to penetrate deep into the matrix of aluminum alloy poses great risk to such structural material. Tensile stressed SS 304 suffered more corrosion than unstressed SS 304 in both the field and laboratory conditions. Results from this case study may shed new light on the deicer corrosion issue and help develop improved field testing methods to evaluate the deicer corrosivity to metals in service.",

        "abstract": "The rigorous organic/inorganic laminated structure of nacre is developed by millions of years of biological evolution against various external impacts including mechanical loadings and chemical attacks. Nacre-biomimetic materials have been recognized as an effective strategy to achieve high strength and toughness simultaneously. Yet, the understanding of nacre-like structure from the perspective of corrosion protection is still very limited. This work investigates the anticorrosion performance of nacre-biomimetic GO/epoxy (NBGE) coatings with alternating layers. Potentiodynamic polarization measurements indicated that the corrosion rate of steel protected by the NBGE coating with 5 layers of GO and 6 layers of epoxy (5NBGE) and a total thickness of 17 um was 20 times slower than that of steel under the pure epoxy coating twice as thick, in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements revealed the importance and functions of the GO layers in NBGE coatings. The 5NBGE coating exhibited better performance than carbon-based nanoparticle/epoxy mixed coatings. The superior anticorrosion performance of the NB5G6E coating was supported by photographic observations, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and chloride diffusion measurements. The strong cross-linking layer-by-layer structure of NBGE coatings was proved by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses. The anticorrosion mechanism of the NBGE coatings was interpreted by the mitigation of chemical reactions occurring at the steel/coating interface due to the restricted intrusion of O2, H2O, and Cl- through the reduced pores/defects by the intercalated GO layers in the coatings, as shown in the above graphics.",

Performance goals for snow and ice control were identified in the survey, with average rankings as follows (in descending order): safety, mobility, economy, essential functions, environment, infrastructure, and livability. The survey results were also tabulated and analyzed to identify best practices and future trends in the agencies. Restoring safety and mobility consistently remains a priority of nearly all agencies.

        "abstract": "Foamed cement-based materials have attracted much attention as a new type of thermal insulation materials (TIMs) that may offer a sustainable solution to the built environments. This laboratory study explores the combined use of nano-montmorillonite and polyethylene microfiber in foamed paste with high volume fly ash (HVFA) binder. A total of 16 foamed HVFA paste mixtures were fabricated which consisted of 70% Class F fly ash, 30% Portland cement, 2% sodium alpha-olefin sulfonate, 0.38% Na\u2083PO\u2084, and 2% nano-montmorillonite. The dosage and type of polyethylene microfibers (90 m in diameter) were explored in the present study, with six dosages (0, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5% by volume) and three lengths (3 mm, 6 mm, and 9 mm) tested. Based on the experimental results, the highest 28-day rupture strength (1.51 MPa) was achieved with the use of 3-mm long PE microfibers at 0.4 vol.%. Synergistic utilization of nMMT and microfibers exhibited a great influence on the dry density and water absorption of the foamed paste. The SEM micrographs illustrated the multiple mechanisms by which the microfibers serve to reduce shrinkage-induced cracking of the foamed paste. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was employed to obtain the contents of Ca, Si, Al, S and mole ratios of Ca/Si, Ca/(Si + Al), S/Ca, and Al/Si in the hardened pastes, which reveal the difference in hydration products near or away from the nMMT-pretreated polyethylene microfibers. The results of microhardness test were also used to elucidate such nano-/micro-synergistic effects, which improved the bonding between microfibers and foamed paste matrix. A mechanism was proposed to explain the role of various admixtures and the balanced performance of such inorganic TIMs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The consensus on mechanisms responsible for how chloride-based salts attack concrete has yet not been achieved. This work exposed laboratory-fabricated concrete samples to MgCl 2  solutions of various concentrations along with freeze/thaw and wet/dry cycles, with NaCl solutions as the control. The laboratory investigation revealed a new chemical mechanism during the MgCl 2 -induced deterioration of concrete, i.e., the formation of multi-phase nano-sized crystals, including CaCl 2 , Mg(OH) 2 , and Mg 3 (OH) 5 Cl\u00b7(H 2 O) 4 . This mechanism was further corroborated by the testing of concrete samples cored from several selected concrete bridge decks, where cumulative exposure to MgCl 2  deicer resulted in significantly compromised splitting tensile strength (as high as 50%) as well as reductions in microhardness (up to 60%, often at a depth of 25 to 50\u202fmm). This study provides new insights into the risks of MgCl 2  to the concrete-built environment. It also alerts that visual inspection could be misleading for condition assessment of concrete exposed to MgCl 2 .",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To divert fly ash from hazardous waste stream to beneficial uses, this work aims to improve the solidification of fly ash as a geopolymer material by using graphene oxide (GO). The hydration precursors, morphology, elemental composition, mineralogy, chemical structure and ordering of GO-modified fly ash geopolymer were investigated by means of Raman spectroscopy, SEM/BSE, EMPA, XRD/TGA and  29 Si/ 27 Al MAS-NMR, respectively, to unravel the role of GO. The experimental results suggest that GO regulated the Ca/Si, Si/Al and Ca/(Si\u202f+\u202fAl) mole ratios to facilitate the formation of fly ash hydrates with improved mechanical strength, as GO showed the ability to selectively affect the distribution of different hydration precursors. GO also promoted the formation of low quartz and jennite-like hydrates. Overall, the 28-day compressive strength of fly ash geopolymer ( w/b \u202f=\u202f0.35) in this study was improved by 23% (from 33.6\u202fMPa to 41.4\u202fMPa) with GO admixed at 0.02% by mass of fly ash. The NMR study showed that GO improved the polymerization degree of fly ash geopolymer by increasing the total Q 3  and Q 4  Si-tetrahedrons, which suggests potential for improving the immobilization of heavy metals in fly ash.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The objective of this work is to examine the state of knowledge relevant to permeable concrete pavements (PCPs) and facilitate efforts in enhancing their overall performance and maximizing their environmental benefits. Based on a review of recent literature, this work provides a summary of the key environmental benefits of PCPs, in terms of stormwater runoff reduction, underground water quality improvement, heat-island effect mitigation, traffic noise reduction, and skid resistance improvement. The hydraulic performance of PCPs is determined by its mix design, pavement design, construction practice, and service environment. In general, it is difficult to simultaneously optimize the mechanical and durability properties and infiltration performance of PCPs. New technologies need to be developed to help improve the durability of PCPs without significantly increasing its maintenance requirements or sacrificing its infiltration properties. Freeze/thaw damage, deicer impacts, and clogging phenomenon still create bottleneck problems for the implementation of PCPs. The durability of PCPs in cold climates is governed by many factors, and advances could be made at many stages of its life cycle. Challenges remain in quantitative characterization of permeable concrete materials and in establishing quantitative relationships between physicochemical characteristics and performance of permeable concrete. Modeling and advanced characterization are expected to greatly advance the PCP technology. This review also provides a look to the future, for instance, there are some emerging areas of research (e.g., nano-science and nano-engineering) that may help address the durability challenges or further enhance the environmental benefits of PCPs.",

To this end, various laboratory tests were conducted to investigate the compressive strength of and chloride diffusivity in mortar and concrete samples with cement partially replaced by various minerals (class F and class N fly ash, ultra-fine fly ash, silica fume, metakaolin, and ground granulated blast-furnace slag), the porosity of mineral concretes, the freeze\u2013thaw resistance of mineral mortars in the presence of deicers, and the effect of supplementary cementitious materials on the chloride binding and chemistry of the pore solution in mortar. Keywords Mineral admixtures Reinforced concrete Chloride-induced corrosion Fly ash Silica fume Metakaolin Ground granulated blast-furnace slag Deicer scaling resistance 1 Introduction Concrete is the most widely used man-made building material in the world, owing to its versatility and relatively low cost. Concrete has also become the material of choice for the construction of structures exposed to extreme conditions [1] . Furthermore, sustainability has become an increasingly important characteristic for concrete infrastructure, as the production of Portland cement (the most common binder in concrete) is an energy-intensive process that accounts for a significant portion of global carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases [2,3] . As such, even slight improvements in the design, production, construction, maintenance, and materials performance of concrete can have enormous social, economic and environmental impacts. There are a variety of approaches to enhancing the sustainability of concrete and reducing its environmental footprint. One attractive approach is to enhance the durability of concrete infrastructure, since durability is a key cornerstone for sustainability. According to the ASCE 2009 Report Card for America\u2019s Infrastructure , $2.2 trillion needs to be invested over 5 years to \u2018bring the nation\u2019s infrastructure to a good condition\u201d [4] , which highlights the urgent need for research devoted to longer-lasting and \u201cmaintenance-free\u201d concrete materials. There is general agreement that the most effective improvement in concrete durability can be achieved at the design and materials selection stage of a project by using adequate concrete cover and high-quality concrete. Usually, an increase in the thickness of the concrete cover leads to beneficial effects, because it increases the barrier to the various aggressive species moving towards the reinforcement and increases the time for corrosion to initiate. In reality, however, the cover thickness cannot exceed certain limits, for mechanical and practical reasons [5] . In light of advances in concrete technology and requirements of the AASHTO Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) for a 75-year design life, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) adopted the approach of using the chloride diffusivity through concrete to determine the concrete cover requirements for structures subjected to chloride-bearing environments [6] . For instance, for bridge members exposed to corrosive soil or water (containing more than 500 ppm of chlorides), the maximum water-to-cementitious-materials (w/cm) ratio shall not exceed 0.40. Mineral admixtures conforming to ASTM Designation C 618 Type F or N (e.g., fly ash \u2013 FA) are required for all exposure conditions, except for \u2018non-corrosive\u2019 exposure conditions. For such bridge members as precast piles and pile extensions exposed to corrosive conditions, mineral admixtures conforming to ASTM Designation C 1240 (e.g., silica fume \u2013 SF) may be required. The minimum concrete cover required for bridge members ranges from 1 to 5 in., dependent on the bridge member type and exposure condition [6] . Recent years have seen increasing interest in environmentally-friendly concretes (EFCs), which utilize industrial byproducts or waste materials and thus benefit the environment. Among them, mineral admixtures such as fly ash, silica fume, and slag \u2013 have been used to partially replace cement in concrete while shown to enhance concrete durability and improve resistance to chloride diffusion. They are also known as supplementary cementitious materials, or SCMs. Like other state DOTs, Caltrans has developed concrete mixes for corrosion mitigation of structures with the aid of such SCMs. However, the work to date has been based on diffusion coefficient data for low permeability, mineral admixture concretes selected from available literature, which may not represent the materials and exposure conditions seen in California. Furthermore, a significant amount of variability exists in determining chloride diffusion coefficients as an indicator of concrete durability. First, values of chloride diffusion coefficient usually vary from 10 \u221213 m 2 /s to 10 \u221210 m 2 /s in relation to the concrete properties and the exposure conditions. In particular, these values depend on the concrete pore structure and on all the factors that determine it, such as: mix design parameters (w/cm ratio, type and proportion of mineral admixtures and cement, compaction, curing, etc.) and presence of cracks. The chloride diffusion coefficient is also a function of chloride exposure condition (submerged, splash, atmosphere, etc.) and the length of exposure, partly due to hydration of slowly reacting constituents such as blast furnace slag or fly ash [5] . When the chloride diffusion coefficient is used to evaluate the risk for reinforcement corrosion and to forecast the service life of concrete structures, chloride threshold is a very important parameter, the value of which is still a subject of controversy. In reality, the determination of chloride diffusion coefficient and chloride threshold is often affected by the method of chloride analysis. Second, existing chloride permeability tests are either very time-consuming for high-quality concrete mixes or too biased to provide reliable chloride diffusion coefficients. The objectives of this research are to validate chloride diffusion coefficients of mineral admixture concrete mix designs currently developed by the Caltrans for corrosion mitigation, and to verify the adequacy of existing measures to mitigate corrosion caused by exposure to marine environments and deicing salt applications. 2 Experimental 2.1 Sample preparation In light of the representative concrete mixes and chloride exposure conditions in California, a preliminary design for the laboratory investigation was developed, in the form of a matrix of 18 concrete mix designs that need to be evaluated (see Table 1 ). All these concrete mix designs feature a water-to-cementitious-materials ( w/cm ) ratio of 0.40. The concrete mix design without any mineral admixtures is used as a control. These mix designs were determined in close consultation with the Caltrans Corrosion Technology Branch staff. On the basis of Table 1 , multiple trials were conducted in order to achieve reasonable workability of fresh concrete (slump) for each mix design. For this study, an ASTM specification C150-07 Type I/II low-alkali Portland cement from the Ash Grove Montana City Plant (Clancy, MT) was used. Coarse aggregates (with maximum size of 3/4\u2033 or 19 mm) and fine aggregates (clean, natural silica sand) were purchased from the JTLGroup (Belgrade, MT). Glenium 3030\u2122 and Micro-Air\u2122 were used as the ASTM C 494 Type A/F water reducing agent and the ASTM C 260 air-entraining agent respectively and at the dosage per the instructions. After the trials, the two Class N fly ash designs (at 25% replacement level) were excluded from further investigation with approval of the Caltrans technical panel, since these two mixes could not achieve desired slump and air content with the specified w/cm ratio of 0.4 even with the excessive amounts of multiple water-reducers. This left 16 concrete mixes for the study as shown in Table 2 . These concrete mixes had a coarse-aggregate-to-cementitious-materials ratio varying between 2.17 and 2.86 and a coarse-to-fine-aggregates ratio between 1.51 and 1.54. Such variations were necessary in order to achieve reasonable slump and air content, similar to the field construction scenarios during batching operations. Note that the actual air content achieved deviated from the target air content in Table 1 in spite of the multiple trials for each mix design. It was also noticed that concrete made using a smaller lab mixer with same formulation usually had lower air content than using a larger lab mixer. For each mix design, at least three replicate 12\u2033 by 6\u2033 (diameter 305 mm \u00d7 height 152 mm) concrete cylinders and at least three replicate 4\u2033 by 8\u2033 (diameter 102 mm \u00d7 height 203 mm) compression cylinders were prepared. The coarse aggregates and fine aggregates were oven-dried and then potable water was added in the amount twice as much as their absorption capacity (e.g., 1.8%). The aggregates were then soaked for 24 h to ensure that they had fully absorbed moisture and had moisture in excess of the surface-saturated-dry (SSD) condition. The saturated aggregates and the excessive water were used in the mix, taking into account the excessive water when calculating the w/cm ratio. The fine and coarse aggregates were added to the 2-cubic-feet (57-L) mixer and mixed until a homogeneous mixture was obtained. Then the cement was added and mixed again until a homogeneous mixture was obtained. Next, water was added from a graduated cylinder and mixed until the concrete is homogeneous and of the desired consistency. The batch was remixed periodically during the casting of the test specimens and the mix container was covered to prevent evaporation. Slump and air content measurements were performed by the ASTM C 143 and C 173 methods respectively, to check the workability and quality of the freshly mixed concrete; and the data are shown in Table 2 . Fresh concrete was cast into hollow poly(vinyl chloride) piping cylinders and then carefully compacted to minimize the amount of entrapped air. The cylindrical samples were demolded after curing for 24 h with over 90% relative humidity. After demolding, the samples were cured in the moist cure room (with over 90% relative humidity) for another 359 days before the accelerated chloride migration test. For testing of chloride diffusivity, slice specimens with diameter of 2\u2033 (51 mm) and thickness of 1\u2033 (25 mm) were cored from the center of cured cylinders to minimize possible effects of surface evaporation and air entrapment on the permeability of slice specimen. Cores were removed from the concrete according to the ASTM C42/C 42 M (2004) Standard Test Method of Obtaining and Testing Drilled Cores and Sawed Beams of Concrete . The specimen thickness was chosen based on two considerations. It is thick enough to reasonably represent the heterogeneity nature of the concrete and to consider the maximum aggregate size (3/4\u2033). It is not too thick so that the accelerated chloride migration test can be completed in reasonable time frame. Furthermore, nine mortar mixes (mixes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17 in Table 2 ) were prepared without any coarse aggregates, water-reducer, or air-entraining agent. The w/cm ratio of the mortar samples was set at 0.45 instead of 0.40, in light of workability concerns. For each mix design, at least three replicate 2\u2033 by 4\u2033 (diameter 51 mm \u00d7 length 102 mm) cylinders for diffusivity testing, at least sixteen replicate 1 7/8\u2033 by 1 1/2\u2033 (height 48 mm \u00d7 diameter 38 mm) cylinders for freeze\u2013thaw testing, and at least nine replicate 2\u2033 by 4\u2033 (diameter 51 mm \u00d7 length 102 mm) compression cylinders were prepared. This aims to shed light on the role of coarse aggregates and to better interpret the chloride diffusion data in concrete containing various types and amounts of mineral admixtures. For mortar samples, cement is mixed with water at a low-speed hand mixer for 5 min. Subsequently, fine aggregates, with a maximum size of 1.18 mm in diameter, were added, after which the slurries were stirred for 3 min. The fine aggregates were prepared to SSD condition in advance. All the slurries were cast into hollow poly(vinyl chloride) piping cylinders and then carefully compacted to minimize the amount of entrapped air. The cylindrical samples were demolded after curing for 24 h with over 90% relative humidity. After demolding, the samples were cured with over 90% relative humidity for another 89 days before the accelerated chloride migration test. For testing of chloride diffusivity, slice specimens with a thickness of 8 mm were cut from the center of cured cylinders to minimize possible effects of surface evaporation and air entrapment on the permeability of slice specimen. This was done using a low-speed saw equipped with a diamond blade. 2.2 Mechanical testing All the compression strength testing of mortar and concrete samples was conducted in accordance with ASTM C873/C873 M \u2013 04e1 Standard Test Method for Compressive Strength of Concrete Cylinders . The compressive strength of concrete samples were first calculated by dividing the measured ultimate strength by the area of specimen cross-section, then multiplied by the length/diameter correction factor when necessary, and finally presented in the unit of psi, or pounds per square inch. The concrete cylinders were 4\u2033 by 8\u2033 (diameter 102 mm \u00d7 height 203 mm) and cured for 90 days before testing, whereas the mortar cylinders were 2\u2033 by 4\u2033 (diameter 51 mm \u00d7 length 102 mm) and cured for 1 day and 28 days respectively, prior to the compression testing. The compressive strength of each mix design was obtained by averaging the data from at least three replicate cylinders. Young\u2019s modulus (in GPa) and modulus of toughness (in kJ/m 3 ) were also analyzed for mortar samples based on the stress\u2013strain curve. 2.3 Electro-migration and natural diffusion To rapidly measure the chloride diffusivity in the high-quality concrete and mortar samples, a modified version of rapid migration test, i.e., accelerated chloride migration test ( ACMT ), was conducted. The ACMT periodically measures the accumulative chloride ion concentration in the destination compartment using a calibrated chloride sensor. This test was originally developed by Truc et al. [7] and improved by Shi et al. [8,9] . In addition, for a few selected concrete mixes (mixes 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 13), the migration test was also conducted without the externally applied electric field, i.e., through natural diffusion. Prior to such chloride diffusivity tests, the 8-mm thick mortar disk and 25-mm thick concrete disk specimens were polished to achieve a uniform surface roughness and thickness, using silicon carbide sandpapers from grit sizes from 400 to 800. The ACMT, or electro-migration test is designed to rapidly measure the apparent diffusion coefficient, D app , of chloride through water-saturated cementitious samples (including hardened cement paste, mortar, or concrete), using the experimental setup with a two-compartment cell shown in Fig. 1 . The experimental setup features a disk-shaped concrete specimen that separates the chloride anion source (a solution of 3% NaCl and 1% NaOH) and the chloride anion destination (a 1% NaOH solution). Each of the two-compartments will contain one 316L stainless steel mesh electrode with a given exposed surface area (\u223c15 cm 2 ). A disk specimen (paste, mortar or concrete) was sandwiched between two plastic compartments. Solution leakage between the plastic rim and the disk specimen was prevented by the use of washers, nuts, bolts, rubber gaskets, and silicone sealer. Once the concrete disk, electrolytes, and electrodes are in place, a 30-V DC electric field will be maintained across the disk through the two mesh electrodes in the two-compartments. During the test, readings of chloride concentration in the destination compartment are taken periodically using a calibrated chloride sensor, on a 2-h interval or more frequently if necessary. In addition, the electric current in the circuit is periodically measured in order to calculate the amount of electric charge passing through the disk during the electro-migration test. The chloride sensor is periodically calibrated using known solutions and the readings from them will be converted to units of molarity and plotted as a function of time. Diffusion of ionic species in cementitious materials depends heavily on the amount of aqueous solutions in the pore space. It is thus important to minimize the possible influence of chloride penetration mechanisms other than diffusion (e.g., wicking) on the measured chloride diffusion coefficient. To this end, after the disk specimens were taken out of the moist curing environment (for mortar) or cored from the moist-cured sample (for concrete), they were further saturated with de-ionized water for 2 h using the two-compartment cell prior to migration testing. In order to accelerate the electro-migration tests, eight electro-migration assemblies were concurrently used in parallel to a DC power supply. Custom-made chloride sensors were prepared by electroplating clean silver wires, using the computer-controlled potentiostat to apply 1, 0.2, 0.5, and 0.1 mA/cm 2 for plating about 30, 30, 30 and 100 min, respectively. This process helps to form a dense Ag/AgCl sensing layer on the surface of silver wires and improve their resistance to the oxidation attack by the highly alkaline solutions. There should be a very strong correlation between the open circuit potential (OCP) of the custom-made chloride sensor and logarithm of chloride concentration. As such, they were always calibrated before being used to periodically measure the chloride concentration in the destination compartments. Fig. 2 illustrates the typical results obtained from the electro-migration test. The breakthrough time t 0 is the point after which the Cl \u2212 concentration in the destination solution (anolyte) shows a significant linear increase with time, i.e., the intersection of the two fitted straight lines. The electro-migration test can be terminated when the chloride concentration in the destination compartment shows a clear bilinear pattern (typically falls in the 20\u201350 mM range). The method used to calculate the steady-state diffusion coefficient ( D s ) of Cl \u2212 in cement paste, mortar or concrete samples is described as follows. Under an externally applied electric field with an intensity of E , the velocity of chloride ions ( \u03bd ) can be described by the Nernst\u2013Einstein equation: (1) \u03bd = zFD RT where z , F , R and T are charge number, Faraday constant, gas constant and absolute temperature, respectively. The velocity of chloride ions can also be calculated from: (2) \u03bd = d t 0 E where t 0 is the time required for the chloride front to penetrate a depth d of the sample. Such a quantity can be estimated from the measured Cl \u2212 concentration profiles in the anolyte (destination solution) by locating the point after which the Cl \u2212 concentration in the anolyte increases dramatically with time. The diffusion coefficient D s can be estimated from Eqs. (1) and (2) as follows [9] : (3) D = dRT t 0 zEF The electro-migration test lasts until significant chloride ion concentration is detected in the destination compartment, i.e., t 0 can be readily estimated from the chloride concentration profile over time. This could be hours, days, or weeks depending on the thickness and quality of the test specimen and the applied voltage. 2.4 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements EIS is a non-destructive means of providing fundamental information on interfaces as well as on the properties of mortar or concrete [8] . Before and after the electro-migration tests, the Gamry Reference 600\u2122 Potentiostat/Galvanostat/ZRA instrument was utilized to take the EIS measurements so as to quantitatively characterize the microstructural characteristics of the concrete specimen. The two stainless steel mesh electrodes in the two compartments served as the working electrode and the counter electrode respectively, whereas a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) placed in the analyte served as the reference electrode. By applying sinusoidal perturbations with a frequency from 300 kHz to 5 MHz, the working electrode was polarized by \u00b110 mV around its OCP and the current response vs. the applied voltage was recorded to produce the EIS spectrum. Subsequently, the Gammy Echem Analyst\u2122 software was used to analyze the EIS data using the electrical equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 3 . The equivalent circuit model contains R cement and Q cement to characterize the electrical resistance and capacitance of the cementitious disk specimen. n cement is defined as the fitting coefficient for Q cement , with 0 and 1 corresponding to the worst and the best capacitor respectively. The circuit also includes a Warburg impedance (W) indicative of the diffusion process through an interface and R 1 and R 2 indicative of the solution resistance and the charge transfer resistance on the working electrode respectively. 2.5 Chloride binding capacity and pore solution chemistry of mortar samples The chloride binding capacity of mortar samples incorporating various types and amounts of mineral admixtures was measured, following the method by Delagrave et al. [10] . First, the 90-day mortar samples were dried and grounded into powder. The powder was then screened through a 150-\u03bcm sieve, oven-dried at 80 \u00b0C overnight and cooled to room temperature. For each mix design, five kinds of chloride-containing simulated pore solutions were prepared for subsequent binding tests, with sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration of 1000, 5000, 10,000, 20,000 and 30,000 mg/L respectively. Dry mortar powders (10 g) were added into 50 mL of chloride solution, after which sufficient time was allowed so that the equilibrium between the solution and solid phase could be established. The residual chloride concentration for each test was then measured by chloride sensors. For pore solution chemistry testing, the pore solutions tested were not extracted from the mortar samples; instead, they were prepared by adding 10 g of mortar powders into 50 ml of de-ionized water and allowing the solution to sit in a high purity nitrogen atmosphere for 24 h for equilibrium. Subsequently, the pH of the solution was tested and its chemistry was analyzed using Ion Chromatography-Inductively Coupled Plasma (IC/ICP). Hydroxyl ion concentrations of the extracted solutions were determined by titration using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) solutions. The titration to determine the pore solution pH was conducted in a high purity nitrogen atmosphere, in order to avoid the exposure of test solution to the atmospheric carbon dioxide [11] . 2.6 Porosity measurements of concrete samples Porosity is the ratio of the void volume to the total sample volume. The technique to characterize porosity in cementitious materials relies on impregnation of the sample with water. Before experiments, the concrete samples were thoroughly dried in oven. During water infiltration into the concrete specimen, the pores were evacuated of air by boiling the water that contained the specimen. The volume of pore space is calculated by subtracting the dry weight of the specimen from its saturated weight. The volume of permeable voids ( % ) of the concrete is determined by the Archimedean principle, i.e. the total volume is calculated by subtracting the weight of the sample suspended in water from its weight in air. The percentage porosity can be calculated as follows [12] : (4) p = ( W s - W d ) ( W s - W w ) \u00d7 100 % where p is the percent porosity, W s is the weight of the saturated sample, W d is the weight of the dry sample, and W w is the weight of the saturated sample suspended in water. For each concrete mix, at least two specimens were tested. 2.7 Freeze\u2013thaw resistance of mortar samples While compressive strength is the most widely accepted parameter used to judge the quality of concrete, corrosion properties of concrete can be more important to the service life of concrete. For reinforced concrete, freeze\u2013thaw resistance can be another aspect of durability in addition to chloride-induced corrosion of rebar, especially in the cold-climate regions. In this study, mortar samples used for the freeze\u2013thaw were 17 7/8\u2033 by 1 1/2\u2033 (height 48 mm \u00d7 diameter 38 mm) cylinders. Laboratory measurements of changes to mortar samples through freeze/thaw testing in the presence of various chloride solutions were conducted following the SHRP H205.8 test method entitled \u201cTest Method for Rapid Evaluation of Effects of Deicing Chemicals on Concrete\u201d with minor modifications. The SHRP H205.8 test evaluates the effects of chemical deicing formulations and freeze/thaw cycling on the structural integrity of small test specimens of non-air-entrained concrete. The method quantitatively evaluates degradation of the specimen through weight loss measurements and thus sheds light on the durability of the mortar samples with or without various SCMs admixed. Note that the test results from this method may not be suitable for predicting the field performance of concrete, considering its short duration. Once moist-cured for 90 days, the mortar specimens were allowed to dry overnight and weighed. The freeze\u2013thaw resistance of each mortar mix was tested in the presence of four solutions, including: de-ionized water, 23% NaCl, 30% calcium chloride (CaCl 2 ) and 30% magnesium chloride (MgCl 2 ). The last three are the main ingredients of deicers used for winter highway operations at their application concentration for snow and ice control, whereas the de-ionized water is used as a control. For each solution, four concrete specimens were placed on a cellulose sponge inside a dish containing 310 ml of the solution and then covered with plastic wrap to avoid water evaporation and to slightly compress each test specimen into the sponge. For the first round of testing, the deicers were used at their application concentrations respectively, without any dilution. One end of each test specimen was in full contact with the sponge. The test specimens (along with the deicer sponge and dish) were placed in the freezer for 16\u201318 h at \u221217.8 \u00b1 2.7 \u00b0C (\u22120.04 \u00b0F). Subsequently, the specimens (along with the deicer sponge and dish) were placed in the laboratory environment at 23 \u00b1 1.7 \u00b0C (73.4 \u00b0F) and with a relative humidity ranging from 45% to 55% for 6\u20138 h, at which temperature every deicer tested thawed once it was taken out of the freezer for some time. This cycle was repeated 10 times. The average heating rate and cooling rate was observed to be 0.4 \u00b0C/min and 1.2 \u00b0C/min, respectively. After complete thawing following the 10th cycle, test specimens were carefully removed from the dish, individually rinsed under running tap water, and hand-crumbled to remove any material loosened during the freeze/thaw cycling. The largest intact part of each test specimen was then placed in open air to dry for 24 h at 23 \u00b1 1.7 \u00b0C (73.4 \u00b0F) and a relative humidity ranging of 45\u201355%. After drying, test specimens are weighed. The test specimens were then immersed in de-ionized water for 24 h to allow any possible salt contamination to leach out, and then dried and weighed. For the second round of testing, each liquid deicer solution was further diluted by de-ionized water from their application concentration at a 3% by volume. The specimens were subjected to another ten temperature cycles as described above and their final dry weights were also recorded. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Mechanical properties of mortar and concrete samples and correlation with chloride diffusivity Table 3 presents the mechanical results of mortar samples containing various types and amounts of mineral admixtures. It can be seen that the partial replacement of cement by 20% class F FA and 5% SF, by 20% class F FA and 5% metakaolin (MK), and by 25% class F FA alone greatly reduced the 1-day compressive strength of mortar samples, whereas the partial replacement of cement by 10% MK, 10% SF, 10% ultra-fine fly ash (UFFA), 50% ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS), or 25% class N FA improved the 1-day strength to various degrees. The combined addition of class F and MK dramatically reduced the 7-day compressive strength of mortar samples, followed by the use of GGBFS or SF, whereas the addition of most other minerals (except MK) also decreased the 7-day strength to various degrees. The combined addition of class F and MK increased the 28-day compressive strength of mortar samples, whereas the addition of most other minerals (except GGBFS) decreased the 28-day strength to various degrees. All the SCMs dramatically reduced the 1-day Young\u2019s modulus of mortar samples, but they showed mixed effect on the 7-day and 28-day Young\u2019s modulus. All the SCMs dramatically reduced the 7-day and 28-day modulus of toughness, but they showed mixed effect on the 1-day modulus of toughness. The reduction in the moduli of concrete is beneficial as it renders the concrete less prone to shrinkage cracking, which in turn, reduces the risk of rapid chloride ingress. According to the EIS measurements after the ACMT using 90-day old mortar samples, all the SCMs dramatically increased the electrical resistivity of the mortar samples in the electrolyte while most SCMs (except GGBFS) decreased the electrical capacitance of the mortar to various degrees. Table 3 also shows the effect of partially replacing cement with SCMs on the steady-state diffusion coefficient ( D s ), obtained from the ACMT using 90-day old mortar samples. The results indicate that the use of 20% class F FA and 5% SF as cement replacement significantly increased the chloride diffusivity in mortar and the use of 10% MK or 50% GGBFS significantly decreased it, whereas other SCMs decreased the D s to various degrees. Table 4 presents the properties of the concrete mixes, including their average 90-day compressive strength and the D s obtained from the ACMT using 360-day old concrete samples. There is no clear trend related to the effect of SCMs on the 90-day compressive strength of concrete or the chloride diffusivity in the 360-day concrete samples. Nonetheless, the chloride diffusivity is much lower in the concrete mixes than in their corresponding mortar mixes, with the D s values in the order of 10 \u221213 m 2 /s in concrete and of 10 \u221211 m 2 /s in mortar. This highlights the important role of coarse aggregates in slowing down the chloride ingress into concrete. Furthermore, Table 4 indicates that all the mortar mixes had a 28-day compressive strength above 4000 psi (27.6 MPa) whereas the non-air-entrained concrete mixes at 90 days on average featured twice as high a compressive strength. Such extremely high-strength values suggest that the hardened concrete had outstanding microstructure, which is consistent with their extremely low D s values indicative of chloride diffusivity. The compressive strength of air-entrained concrete was consistently lower than that of their non-air-entrained counterpart, yet the differences in their chloride diffusivity were not as appreciable. The extremely low D s values of concrete specimens tested are indirectly confirmed by the natural diffusion test results. For mixes 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13, the migration test was also conducted without the externally applied electric field, i.e., through natural diffusion. Even after 280 days, the chloride concentration in the destination compartment of all natural diffusion test cells generally remained well below 5 mM, indicating that the diffusion front of chloride ions had not penetrated across the 25-mm concrete specimens. With the D s values obtained from the ACMT, it is possible to evaluate the time required for chloride ions to migrate across concrete samples in the natural diffusion state. The penetration of chlorides across concrete is a dynamic process driven by the chloride concentration gradients. Assuming that the boundary conditions and diffusion coefficient are constant with respect to time and space, the solution of Fick\u2019s second law is given as follows: (5) C ( x , t ) = C s 1 | erf x 2 Dt where C s is the chloride concentration in the source solution; x is the thickness of concrete samples; D is the diffusion coefficient for chloride; t is time. Given the D s values of mixes 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13 (averaging 2.98 \u00d7 10 \u221213 m 2 /s, see Table 4 ), it would take about 2 years to penetrate the 25-mm concrete specimen to reach a concentration of 5 mM in the destination compartment. The natural diffusion results thus indirectly confirmed the order of magnitude of D s values of concrete specimens obtained from the ACMT. Fig. 4 a illustrates the relationship between the compressive strength of the mortar samples and the chloride diffusion coefficient in them, whereas Fig. 4 b illustrates such relationship for the concrete samples. Generally speaking, the lower D s values corresponded to the higher compressive strength values, as both indicate high-quality of the mortar or concrete. This is consistent with the tendency reported by Gao et al. [13] . Nonetheless, such correlations did not hold across all the mixes as the type and amount of SCMs in them varied. For both mortar and concrete, there is the lack of a single correlation for all the mixes. Instead, there are at least two distinct correlations between the compressive strength and the chloride diffusivity. This may be partially related to the slow hydration kinetics of some mortar mixes containing mineral admixtures as well as the effect of certain mineral admixtures on chloride binding, which merit further investigation. Fig. 5 a presents the relationship between the D s values in mortar samples and those in their non-air-entrained concrete counterparts. Generally speaking, the lower D s values in mortar corresponded to the lower D s values in the non-air-entrained concrete, indicating that chloride diffusion in the mortar phase contributed to the overall chloride diffusion in the concrete which consisted of the mortar phase, the coarse aggregate phase, and possibly the paste-aggregate interfacial transition zone (ITZ). For the control concrete mix or the mixes with 20% class F FA and 5% SF or with 25% class F FA, the mortar phase seemed to play a significant role in their chloride diffusivity; whereas for the other concrete mixes the role of mortar phase is less significant. Fig. 5 b presents the relationship between the transformed strength of mortar samples and the 90-day compressive strength of their non-air-entrained concrete counterparts. The transformed mortar strength (TMS) is calculated by the following equation: (6) TMS = ( 7 -day compressive strength + 28 -day compressive strength ) \u00d7 ( coarse-aggregate-to-cementitious-materials ratio + coarse-to-fine-aggregates ratio ) There is a strong proportional correlation between the TMS and the concrete strength, suggesting that the mortar phase is an integral component of the heterogeneous concrete matrix and greatly contributes to its compressive strength. Note that the definition of TMS was proposed based on the experimental data obtained from this specific research and on the existing knowledge that higher levels of coarse aggregates in concrete generally lead to higher strength of the concrete. 3.2 Electro-migration data and correlation with porosity Shown in Fig. 6 a is the temporal evolution of chloride concentration in the destination compartment for some concrete mixes during the ACMT, where each curve generally features two stages. The first stage is characterized by a negligible amount of chloride that has migrated into the analyte, which corresponds to the time-lag period for chlorides to penetrate the concrete sample. Such a stage is followed by a subsequent steady-state period, in which the flux of chloride ions is almost constant. This period is evidenced by a sudden rise in the Cl \u2212 concentration, indicating the arrival of a relative significant amount of Cl \u2212 ions in the destination compartment. The transition time, t 0 , utilized to distinguish such two processes can be defined by the point around which the Cl \u2212 concentration slope changes dramatically in the destination solution, which can be located by the intercept from the tangent lines and the abscissa in Fig. 6 a. The current evolution curve contains abundant information on the transport of all the ions present in the pore solution of mortar or concrete specimens. Fig. 6 b shows four typical electric current density curves in the electrical circuit against time. Such curves are characterized by rapid increase in the initial state, followed by plateaus with steady-state values. The evolution of electric current over time was used to calculate the amount of electric charge ( Q Charge ) passing across the concrete samples, which is given by: (7) Q Charge = \u222b 0 t J ( t ) Adt where J ( t ) is the current density; A is the sample area; t is time; the integration is performed over the whole experiments. Note that the standard RCPT test (AASHTO T 277 or ASTM C 1202) classifies the chloride permeability of concrete based on the charge in the first 6 h. As shown in Fig. 6 b, for high-quality concrete, the more appropriate time frame for a 25-mm thick specimen would be in the hundreds of hours, instead of 6 h. The variation of chloride diffusion coefficients obtained from the electro-migration test is strongly correlated with the physiochemical characteristics of the test specimen, thereby allowing a systematic study of the influence of mix design on chloride diffusivity. Fig. 7 a illustrates a linear correlation between the porosity of concrete and its chloride diffusion coefficient, which shows that the chloride diffusivity generally increases with the volume of permeable voids in concrete. This is reasonable considering the more porous microstructure of concrete leads to a longer zigzag diffusion path for the diffusion of chloride. The relatively low R -square of this correlation may be derived from the experimental errors as well as the fact that chloride diffusion is not only affected by the physical properties of concrete but also the chemical interactions between ionic species and the pore solution. The correlation between the cumulative charge and the chloride diffusion coefficients is presented in Fig. 7 b, where the cumulative charge generally increases with chloride diffusion coefficients. This is reasonable since both parameters have been used to assess the chloride permeability of concrete. A less permeable concrete is expected to feature a low D s value and less electric charge passing through it in a given time period, as suggested by our previous research [8] . 3.3 EIS data of concrete and correlation with chloride diffusivity In this study, the EIS measurements were conducted to non-destructively characterize the microstructural properties of the concrete specimens before and after the ACMT. The complex impedance of the concrete/electrolyte interface was dependent on the frequency of the applied AC polarization signal. The equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 3 was used to model the interfaces between the counter electrode and the working electrode. Fig. 8 a and b present the fitted equivalent circuit parameters, Q cement and R cement , both of which seems to be somewhat correlated with the chloride diffusion coefficient obtained from the ACMT. These correlations, however, were much weaker as those reported in our previous research [8] . The results indicate that both the electrical capacitance ( Q cement ) and the electric resistivity ( R cement ) of the concrete specimen generally increase with its chloride diffusivity. It is intuitive that a less permeable concrete (featuring high D s ) generally has more refined microstructure and thus low Q cement and high R cement values. In this study, the relationship between D s and Q cement greatly deviated from this, likely due to the chloride binding and pore solution chemistry changes induced by the mineral admixtures. Fig. 8 a and b also show that the electrical resistivity of concrete generally decreased after the electro-migration test whereas its electrical capacitance generally increased. This is likely attributable to the coarsening of the microstructure of concrete induced by the externally applied electric field as well as the enriching of ionic species in the pore solution of the concrete. 3.4 Chloride binding of mortar and influence of mineral admixtures The relationship between free and bound chloride is generally non-linear. In order to describe the experimental results with analytical expressions, a Langmuir isotherm for chloride binding is utilized in this study, which follows [14] : (8) C b = aC f 1 + bC f where C b and C f stand for the bound and free chloride concentrations, respectively. \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the binding parameters to be evaluated by the least-square regression. Such parameters reflect the influence from such factors as type and amount of mineral admixtures. Table 5 provides the Langmuir isotherm parameters obtained from experimental data of the nine mortar mixes. The experimental data for four kinds of mortars, as well as the isothermal chloride binding curves, are provided in Fig. 9 . The chloride binding capability against mix design is depicted in Fig. 10 , which represents the chloride binding percentage at various initial chloride concentrations ( C 0 ). Mix design 9 (20% class F FA + 5% MK) and mix design 11 (10% SF) had the lowest binding capacity, whereas mix designs 1 (100% cement), 7 (10% UFFA) and 9 (50% GGBFS) had generally high chloride binding capacity relative to other mixes. These results are consistent with previous study that suggests silica fume to reduce chloride binding capability of concrete [15] . GGBFS has been reported to increase the chloride binding capability, as it promotes the formation of more Friedel\u2019s salt [17] . Nonetheless, the results from this work suggest the ordinary fly ash (both class F and class N) and metakaolin additions to reduce chloride binding capacity of mortar samples, which contradicts the previous knowledge on these minerals. Fly ash is considered to possess much higher capability for chloride binding, as it features much higher amount of active alumina compared with Portland cement [16] . In addition, MK was also found to significantly increase the chloride binding ability when used to partially replace cement in concrete [18] . These discrepancies may be a result of testing the chloride binding capacity with different methods (e.g., the sample preparation and the chloride concentrations used). Table 6 provides the pore solution chemistry of mortar samples containing various types and amounts of mineral admixtures, shown as changes in the key elements that affect the ionic transport in such mineral concretes, i.e., Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe as well as OH \u2212 . While the metallic elements were measured using the IC/ICP, the pH of pore solution was measured using the chemical titration method. All the pH values were lower than 13.0, likely due to the contamination of airborne carbon dioxide into the small mortar specimens. Nonetheless, the pH data suggest that all the mineral admixtures reduced the alkalinity of the pore solution in the mortar samples, regardless of their type and amount. 3.5 Freeze\u2013thaw resistance of mortar in the presence of chlorides After 10 temperature cycles in the presence of concentrated deicers (23% NaCl, 30% CaCl 2 , and 30% MgCl 2 ) and de-ionized water, it was observed that all the mortar samples had insignificant changes in their weight. As such, they were subjected to another ten temperature cycles in the presence of diluted deicers, with each deicer further diluted from their application concentration at a 3% by volume. This 3-to-100 ratio was chosen to simulate the field dilution of liquid or solid deicers once applied onto the pavement for some time. The average weight loss of mortar specimens after the two rounds of testing is presented in Fig. 11 . The results indicate that the weight loss of mortar specimens was the greatest in the presence of diluted NaCl solution, followed by the diluted CaCl 2 , and then by the diluted MgCl 2 solution, whereas the mortar deterioration in the de-ionized water was negligible. In the presence of diluted NaCl solution, the mix designs, the mix designs 13 (10% MK), 15 (10% UFFA) and particularly 17 (50% GGBFS) showed less weight loss relative to the control, whereas other SCMs exacerbated the freeze\u2013thaw damage with the mix designs 5 (25% class N FA) and particularly 7 (20% class F FA + 5% SF) being the worst. In the presence of diluted CaCl 2 and MgCl 2 solutions, the effect of mineral admixtures on the freeze\u2013thaw resistance of mortar followed a trend similar to that seen in the presence of diluted NaCl solution, yet with the mix designs 5 (25% class N FA) and 7 (20% class F FA + 5% SF) being the worst respectively. In summary, the partial replacement of cement by 50% GGBFS is most beneficial for the freeze\u2013thaw resistance of mortar, followed by the 10% UFFA or 10% MK replacement; whereas the use of ordinary fly ash and silica fume seems to undermine the freeze\u2013thaw resistance of mortar in the presence of various diluted chloride solutions. It is postulated that the air-entrained concrete would have better freeze\u2013thaw resistance than their mortar counterparts for two reasons. First, the concrete matrix contains less cement paste phase than its mortar counterpart and is thus less prone to the physical attack by temperature cycling and chemical attack by deicers. Second, the air entrainment introduces microstructure that can mitigate the internal stress due to ice formation and thawing inside the concrete. 4 Conclusions Various laboratory tests were conducted to investigate the properties of mortar and concrete samples with cement partially replaced by various minerals (class F and class N FA, UFFA, SF, MK and GGBFS). These include: the compressive strength, Young\u2019s modulus, and modulus of toughness of mortar samples at 1-d, 7-d and 28-d; the compressive strength and porosity of concrete samples at 90-d; the chloride diffusivity and EIS measurements of hardened mortar and concrete samples; the natural diffusion of chloride into select concrete samples; the freeze\u2013thaw resistance of mortars in the presence of chloride deicers; and the effect of mineral admixtures on the chloride binding and chemistry of the pore solution in mortar. The accelerated chloride migration test of hardened concrete specimens found them to feature unusually low chloride diffusivity ( D s values in the order of 10 \u221213 m 2 /s), corresponding to very high compressive strength. The research findings imply that the chloride diffusivity in high-strength concretes largely determined by the use of coarse aggregates instead of the mineral admixtures. The research also highlights the importance of the processes and procedures used in the new construction, in order to achieve the great potential of reinforced concrete as a construction material and to manage corrosion risks pro-actively.

        "abstract": "We evaluated the chloride permeability and microstructure of Portland cement mortar modified by styrene\u2013butadiene rubber (SBR) latex, using mortar samples with various polymer/cement (P/C) mass ratios. The incorporation of SBR improved the chloride penetration resistance along with the general ionic permeability of the mortar, while increasing its ionic transport resistance and decreasing its electric capacitance. These data suggest that admixing SBR led to denser and more refined microstructure of the cured cement mortar. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy images confirmed such improvements in the pore structure and the formation of an interpenetrating network structure of SBR and cement hydrate phases at relatively higher P/C ratios. Besides slightly reducing Portlandite content and mitigating carbonation with the increasing P/C ratio in mortar, SBR was also found to promote the formation of calcium aluminate trisulfate hydrate phases and facilitated chloride binding.",

This innovative system features the design of microcapsules with oil core and silica gel shell. Methylmethacrylate monomer and triethylborane were selected as the healing agent and the catalyst, i.e. oil core phases in the system. They were microencapsulated, respectively, through an interfacial self-assembly process and sol\u2013gel reaction. Then the microcapsules were dispersed in fresh cement mortar along with carbon microfibers. The self-healing effect was evaluated using permeability measurements along with a fatigue test under uniaxial compression cyclic loading and further confirmed by surface analytical tools including optical microscope and field emission scanning electron microscope coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (FESEM/EDX).",

To make snow fences more effective on highways and provide guidelines for the departments of transportation siting the fences, this work reviews the literature as well as survey responses from practitioners in northern states. This review combines information obtained from the resources to detail several aspects of snow fence use, including history, design protocols, siting policies, benefits, challenges, and numerical modeling. Particular attention is paid to living snow fences as an alternative to traditional structural snow fences. The survey results show that almost all the responding agencies have launched snow fence programs, which have various design and siting protocols that depend on the specific conditions.",

In this work, the performance of different abiotic healing agents, influences and requirements of encapsulation techniques, and characterization and testing methods of healing efficiency are reviewed. The objective is to examine the state of knowledge relevant to developing an abiotic capsule-based system for cementitious materials. The principle of selecting healing agents is based on the service conditions and the objective of self-healing. All the influences of admixing capsules on the properties of fresh and hardened concrete should be taken into consideration. A series of reliable and reproducible standard testing methods need to be developed to unify the parameters in evaluating the healing efficiency. While there is not one self-healing solution that is applicable under all conditions, the general methodology of developing an abiotic, capsule-based self-healing system is proposed.",

Experimental results showed that GO surface treatment slightly improved compressive strength of wet cured HVFA mortar and dry cured cement mortar while it significantly reduced the water absorption of wet cured HVFA mortar and the gas permeability of both wet cured and dry cured cement mortars. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis suggested that the GO surface treatment facilitated the hydration process and densified the microstructure of both types of mortars. X-ray diffraction and Thermogravimetry results revealed the formation of hydroxyl grafted AFm phase at the interface of GO/HVFA mortar. Moreover, the GO surface treatment was found to decrease the carbonation of HVFA mortar but increase that of cement mortar.",

The results indicated that the incorporation of small amount of nanoclay in asphalt concrete produced a notably improved stripping resistance and reduced moisture susceptibility, while the addition of carbon microfiber increased moisture susceptibility.

        "abstract": "PurposeThis work aims to demonstrate the use of electrochemical chloride extraction (ECE) to remove chloride ions away from the steel rebar in chloride-contaminated mortar and to mitigate the corrosion of the embedded steel.Design/methodology/approachTo simulate salt contamination in concrete, sodium chloride was added at 0.5 per cent by weight of cement in the fresh mortar featuring a water-to-cement ratio of 0.45. The ECE treatments were varied at two electrical current densities (1 and 5 A/m2), using two electrolytes (0.1M NaOH and 0.1M Na3BO3 solutions) and for two periods (2 and 4 weeks). The average free chloride concentration in cement mortars before and after ECE treatment was quantified using a customized chloride sensor, whereas the spatial distribution of relevant elements was obtained using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The effect of ECE treatment on the electric resistivity of mortar and the corrosion resistance of steel rebar was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and potentiodynamic polarization measurements, respectively.FindingsThe experimental results reveal that the ECE treatment was effective in removing chlorides and in improving electric resistivity and compressive strength of the mortar, when using the sodium borate solution as the electrolyte. In this case, a 4-week ECE treatment at 1 A/m2 decreased the free chloride content in the mortar by 70 per cent, significantly increased the Ca/Si ratio in the mortar near rebar, led to a more refined and less permeable microstructure of the mortar and significantly improved its compressive strength. The ECE treatment was able to halt the chloride-induced corrosion of steel rebar by passivation. A 4-week ECE treatment at 1 A/m2 using sodium hydroxide and sodium borate solutions decreased the corrosion rate of rebar by 36 and 34 per cent, respectively.Originality/valueThis electrochemical rehabilitation of steel-reinforced concrete under chloride-contaminated condition is very effective in prolonging its service life.",

This work aims to optimize the transport properties of the high volume fly ash (HVFA) mortar in which 60% (by weight) Portland cement was replaced by Class C fly ash. Ten chemical admixtures (five non-polymers and five polymers) were investigated as waterproof admixtures for HVFA mortar. The compressive strength, splitting tensile strength water sorptivity and gas permeability of the mortar admixed with these chemical admixtures were investigated. The results showed that the non-polymer and polymer admixtures with different admixing dosages played different roles in HVFA mortar. This consequently resulted in different behavior in affecting the transport and mechanical properties of HVFA mortars.",

To realize sustainable development and beneficial use of fly ash in the construction industry, this paper presents a comprehensive review of relevant literature to evaluate the properties and performance of fly ash, with a particular focus on recent advances in characterization, compositional understanding, hydration mechanism, activation approaches, durability and sustainability of fly ash as a construction material. Several key aspects governing the performance of fly ash, including chemical composition, activator type and hydrates evolution in concrete, are highlighted. Finally, the important needs, pertinent to the optimal and broad utilization of fly ash as an integral part of sustainable construction materials, are identified for further research and development, where large-scale application studies, further classification of fly ash, advanced characterization tools and technology transfer to biomass fly ash are recommended.",

The laboratory testing measured the consistency value, porosity, compressive strength and thermal conductivity of various cement mortar mixes as a function of feather fiber dosage. The experimental data were used to determine the appropriate weight fraction of feather fibers in the mortars for thermal insulation. The results indicate that the incorporation of feather fibers decreased the consistency value of fresh mortar and increased the surface roughness and porosity of hardened mortar. Under the investigated conditions, as the content of admixed fiber increased, both the compressive strength and thermal conductivity of hardened mortar decreased remarkably before leveling off. The desirable dosage of feather fibers falls in the range of 0.2-0.7% by mass of dry mixture.",

        "abstract": "This laboratory study explores a cost-effective and environmental friendly foamed paste with satisfactory physical properties and outstanding thermal insulation properties. Such a composite material was made by using a high volume of class F coal fly ash as a replacement of Portland cement (70% by mass) and nano-montmorillonite as an admixture. Replacing cement with fly ash at high levels is environmentally and economically desirable, as this not only reduces the energy and carbon footprint of the foamed paste, but also diverts the coal fly ash from the waste stream. A statistical design of experiments was adopted and executed to investigate the effects of various factors on the properties of the composite. At the age of 28 days, the pastes exhibited a high compressive strength ranging from 1.77 MPa to 6.51 MPa and a low thermal conductivity in the range of 0.071 W (m\u22121 K\u22121) to 0.173 W (m\u22121 K\u22121). Two foamed mixes were chosen for further investigation as they presented the best and worst performance as a thermal insulation material. The scanning electron microscopy shed light on the best foamed mix, which contains 70% fly ash, 30% cement, and 1% nano-montmorillonite, and how its microstructure differed from that of the worst mix without nano-montmorillonite. The Ca content, Si/Ca ratio and Al/Ca ratio were obtained from energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy of hardened samples, and used to help explain the observed strength difference between these two mixes. X-ray diffraction was also employed to elucidate the hydration mechanism of HVFC foamed paste.",

The hydrophobicity, surface morphology, and mechanical properties of the coated Al substrates were investigated, along with their electrochemical properties over time of exposure to two NaCl solutions (0.3% and 3% by weight). All the coated Al surfaces exhibited a water contact angle of 155-158\u00b0, i.e., superhydrophobicity. The use of nano-silica suspension significantly enhanced the hydrophobicity of the coated Al. Artificial neural networks were used to provide quantitative understanding in how the microstructure of the treated Al surface contributed to its superhydrophobicity and electrochemical properties. When R a, total (nano-roughness+micro-roughness) exceeds 450nm, WCA is greater than 154\u00b0, independent of the nano/micro-roughness ratio (RR NM). FESEM and AFM images of these surfaces suggest that a rough two-length-scale hierarchical structure coupled with the low surface energy of fluorosilane topcoat led to the superhydrophobicity of the formed coatings. The coating prepared with the 0.2% nano-silica suspension (vs. other concentrations) featured the highest Young's modulus and the best corrosion protection to the Al substrate in both NaCl solutions. \u00a9 2012.",

        "title": "Effect of nanoparticles on the anticorrosion and mechanical properties of epoxy coating",
        "abstract": "Homogeneous epoxy coatings containing nanoparticles of SiO 2 , Zn, Fe 2 O 3 and halloysite clay were successfully synthesized on steel substrates by room-temperature curing of a fully mixed epoxy slurry diluted by acetone. The surface morphology and mechanical properties of these coatings were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, respectively. The effect of incorporating various nanoparticles on the corrosion resistance of epoxy-coated steel was investigated by potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The electrochemical monitoring of the coated steel over 28 days of immersion in both 0.3 wt.% and 3 wt.% NaCl solutions suggested the beneficial role of nanoparticles in significantly improving the corrosion resistance of the coated steel, with the Fe 2 O 3 and halloysite clay nanoparticles being the best. The SiO 2 nanoparticles were found to significantly improve the microstructure of the coating matrix and thus enhanced both the anticorrosive performance and Young's modulus of the epoxy coating. In addition to enhancing the coating barrier performance, at least another mechanism was at work to account for the role of the nanoparticles in improving the anticorrosive performance of these epoxy coatings. Keywords Nanoparticle Epoxy coating Corrosion resistance Nanoindentation SEM EIS AFM 1 Introduction Epoxy has been widely used as a coating material to protect the steel reinforcement in concrete structures\u00a0 [1\u20133] , because of its outstanding processability, excellent chemical resistance, good electrical insulating properties, and strong adhesion/affinity to heterogeneous materials. Epoxy coatings generally reduce the corrosion of a metallic substrate subject to an electrolyte in two ways. First, they act as a physical barrier layer to control the ingress of deleterious species. Second, they can serve as a reservoir for corrosion inhibitors to aid the steel surface in resisting attack by aggressive species such as chloride anions. Nonetheless, the successful application of epoxy coatings is often hampered by their susceptibility to damage by surface abrasion and wear [4,5] . They also show poor resistance to the initiation and propagation of cracks [6] . Such processes introduce localized defects in the coating and impair their appearance and mechanical strength. The defects can also act as pathways accelerating the ingress of water, oxygen and aggressive species onto the metallic substrate, resulting in its localized corrosion. Furthermore, being hydrophilic in nature, epoxy coatings experience large volume shrinkage upon curing and can absorb water from surroundings [7,8] . The pores in the cured epoxy coating can assist in the migration of absorbed water and other species to the epoxy\u2013metal interface, leading to the initiation of corrosion of the metallic substrate and to the delamination of the coating. The barrier performance of epoxy coatings can be enhanced by the incorporation of a second phase that is miscible with the epoxy polymer, by decreasing the porosity and zigzagging the diffusion path for deleterious species. For instance, inorganic filler particles at nanometer scale can be dispersed within the epoxy resin matrix to form an epoxy nanocomposite. The incorporation of nanoparticles into epoxy resins offers environmentally benign solutions to enhancing the integrity and durability of coatings, since the fine particles dispersed in coatings can fill cavities [9\u201311] and cause crack bridging, crack deflection and crack bowing [12] . Nanoparticles can also prevent epoxy disaggregation during curing, resulting in a more homogenous coating. Nanoparticles tend to occupy small hole defects formed from local shrinkage during curing of the epoxy resin and act as a bridge interconnecting more molecules. This results in a reduced total free volume as well as an increase in the cross-linking density [13,14] . In addition, epoxy coatings containing nanoparticles offer significant barrier properties for corrosion protection [15,16] and reduce the trend for the coating to blister or delaminate. This work examines the influence of nanoparticles, including SiO 2 , Zn, Fe 2 O 3 and halloysite clay, on the surface morphology, anticorrosion behavior and Young's modulus of epoxy coatings. It is expected to shed more light on the fundamental mechanisms through which nanoparticles interact with the epoxy matrix and thus provide guidance for the design of high-performance epoxy coatings used for corrosion protection of steel. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials The epoxy resin and its hardener used in this research were obtained from Phoenix Resins Inc. (Cinnaminson, NJ, USA), commercially known as MAS epoxies-FLAG TM . The liquid epoxy resin was a blend of multifunctional low molecular weight diluents and the di-glycedal ether of bis-phenol-A, whereas the hardener was based on adduction reaction chemistry of aliphatic amines. The weight ratio of the epoxy resin to the hardener was 2:1. Zn nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 35 nm, a specific surface area of 30-50 m 2 /g and faceted morphology were purchased from Accumet Materials Co. (Ossining, NY, USA). Spherical SiO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles, obtained from MTI corp. (Richmond, CA, USA), have a mean diameter of 15 and 20 nm and a specific surface area of 440 and > 30 m 2 /g, respectively. Halloysite nanoclay (Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4 \u00b72H 2 O + SiO 2 ) featuring a hollow cylindrical structure was purchased from Reade Advanced Materials (Reno, NV, USA). The steel coupons purchased from Metal Samples (Munford, AL, USA) were of Cor-ten B type (UNS number K11430; density: 7.60 g/cm 3 ; chemical composition: C 0.10\u20130.19%, Cr 0.40\u20130.65%, Cu 0.25\u20130.40%, Fe 97.0\u201398.2%, Mn 0.90\u20131.25%, P \u2264 0.04%, Si 0.15\u20130.30%, S \u2264 0.05%, V 0.02\u20130.10%) with a surface area of 2 cm 2 . Sodium chloride (NaCl) and acetone were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA, USA). 2.2 Nanocomposite preparation Steel substrate preparation : A copper wire was electrically connected to one surface of each cylindrical steel coupon, and then this surface and all the other surfaces except the one exposed to electrolyte for corrosion testing were sealed with a thick bulk epoxy resin. After epoxy curing, the unsealed coupon surface was polished on silicon carbide (SiC) papers down to a grid size of 1000 with the aid of a metallographic grinding disc. After polishing, the sample surface was rinsed with tap water, sonicated in de-ionized water and then rinsed with acetone. Coating preparation : Epoxy composites are usually prepared by dispersing nanoparticles into the epoxy matrix either with a solvent or through a heating process. However, the latter process is prone to clustering or agglomeration of nanoparticles, resulting in poor dispersion. The use of solvent is beneficial for dispersal of nanoparticles in the resin, but the curing agents are usually added to the mixture after the solvent is removed by vacuum evaporation, which deteriorates the homogeneity of the nanocomposites after curing, especially for a high nanoparticle loading. To solve this problem, the curing agent can be added to the mixture before removing the solvent, which is expected to improve the dispersion of nanoparticles in the coating. In addition, the slurry can be directly applied on the surface of metallic substrates to form a uniform thin barrier coating. In this work, acetone was chosen as the solvent, since the analyses by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and FT-Raman [17] indicated that the sonication processing in acetone did not induce chemical change in the epoxy network. Before mixing, both resin and its hardener were diluted separately by acetone with a 1:1 weight ratio. Nanoparticles, which account for 1 wt.% of the total weight of resin and hardener, were added to the resin-acetone solution, followed by stirring at speeds up to 1550 rpm (Model 14-503, Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and sonication (Model 50 T, VWR, West Chester, PA) for 10 min. After that, the hardener-acetone solution was added to the mixture, followed again by stirring and sonication for 10 min. The steel substrate was dipped into the finally obtained mixture for one time and then kept in a dry place at room temperature for 7 days to allow full curing, which led to the formation of a uniform coating for the anticorrosion and surface indentation tests in this work. 2.3 Morphological study of coatings The surface morphology and thickness of the obtained nanocomposite coatings were studied using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM). The films were removed from the steel coupon surface, and then sputter-coated with a very thin Iridium layer (approximately 1\u20132 nm) to avoid the charging effect caused by the nonconductive nature of epoxy coatings and to get high resolution with this virtually grain-free coating material. The surface morphologies and the cross-section were analyzed by a Zeiss Supra 55VP PGT/HKL system, which offers an ultra-high resolution at a relatively low voltage. 2.4 Electrochemical characterization of coatings Electrochemical measurements were conducted using a three-electrode system. The epoxy-coated steel coupon served as the working electrode, while the counter electrode and the reference electrode used were a platinum grid and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) respectively. The coatings evaluated in the electrochemical measurements had similar thickness as those used in the morphological study since they were prepared following the same procedures. The corrosive solutions tested included 0.3 wt.% and 3 wt.% aqueous NaCl solutions. Two methods were used to test the anticorrosive performance of these nanocomposite coatings: electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic weak polarization. Over the 28-day immersion of the coated steel, the EIS measurements were carried out periodically using a Gamry ECM8 Multiplexer. The steel was polarized at \u00b1 10 mV around its open circuit potential (OCP) by an alternating current (AC) signal with its frequency ranging from 10 kHz to 10 mHz (10 points per decade). In the potentiodynamic weak polarization tests, the steel was polarized around its corrosion potential (\u2212 30 mV to 30 mV/SCE vs. OCP by a direct current (DC) signal at a scan rate of 0.2 mV/s. Polarization resistance ( R p ) is defined by the slope of the potential-current density plot at the corrosion potential. Corrosion current ( I corr ) is calculated from I corr = B/ R p , assuming B = 26 mV for the steel corrosion. 2.5 Characterization of mechanical property The mechanical properties of nanocomposite coatings were measured using the nanoindentation method based on Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) [18] . For each sample, 256 pairs of force vs. displacement curves were obtained over the surface from a 5 \u00d7 5 \u03bcm 2 area by subdividing the area into 16 \u00d7 16 equal-sized pixels and acquiring one pair of curves from the center of each pixel. Each pair of curves includes a loading and an unloading curve. The tip velocities for these measurements varied between 0.3 and 0.5 \u03bcm/s. The stiffness of each sample was evaluated by fitting the corresponding loading curves to the Hertzian model which approximates the tip geometry as a hemisphere [16] . The curves are fitted in such a way that only the initial part of the indention (up to 1000 nN loading force) was selected for fitting so that the indentation depth is limited to be less than 100 nm, which is comparable to the tip radius. Such a small indentation depth relative to the coating thickness, usually more than 10 \u00b5m, is in consistence to the hemispherical tip geometry approximation, and also minimizes the possible interference from the substrate contribution. Fitting the indentation data to the Hertzian model in some cases does not give very good results, but the obtained Young's modulus still remains close to the values obtained by other techniques within 50% accuracy [19] . 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Effect of nanoparticles on the morphology of epoxy coating Typical top-view FESEM images of the control coating (plain epoxy, containing no nanoparticles) and the nanocomposite coatings are shown in Fig.\u00a01 a\u2013h . The average thickness of the epoxy coatings was estimated from their cross-sectional view (as shown in Fig.\u00a01 f\u2013h). We used freshly prepared epoxy-acetone solutions and followed identical sample preparation procedures to prepare all the coating samples (with temperature, epoxy concentration, and pulling speed of the steel coupon out of coating solution stayed the same). It was observed that the plain epoxy coating and the epoxy coatings modified by nanoparticles of Zn, Fe 2 O 3 and halloysite clay had a similar thickness of approximately 40 \u03bcm, whereas the nano-SiO 2 modified epoxy coating had a thickness of approximately 10 \u03bcm, according to the FESEM cross-sectional imaging of the coatings ( Fig.\u00a01 f\u2013h). This is mostly due to the significant reduction in the viscosity of the epoxy-acetone solution induced by the addition of SiO 2 nanoparticles. Fig.\u00a01 a indicates that the cured plain epoxy coating has a relatively homogeneous morphology. The epoxy coating modified by SiO 2 nanoparticles with a high specific surface area of 440 m 2 /g was observed to be much denser than the plain epoxy coating and showed no sign of nanoparticle agglomeration ( Fig.\u00a01 c), partly attributable to its reduced internal stress inherent in the reduced coating thickness. The epoxy coating modified by Zn nanoparticles with a lower specific surface area (30\u201350 m 2 /g) was also denser than the plain epoxy coating, but had some agglomeration of nanoparticles ( Fig.\u00a01 b). In the case of the epoxy coating containing Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles with a even lower specific surface area (\u2265 30 m 2 /g), even more agglomeration of nanoparticles was observed along with aggravated microcracks (as shown in Fig.\u00a01 d). Based on the top-view and cross-sectional view of the coating, such microcracks were found to be localized near the top surface of the coating and no crack was observed across the entire thickness of the coating layer or near the coating-steel interface. We speculate that the nanoparticles with higher specific surface area not only served as better nano-fillers for the epoxy matrix, but also more actively participated in the epoxy-curing process (possibly acting as nuclei for the growth of cross-linking epoxy-amine networks). The small size of the nanoparticles is also advantageous since it enables their penetration into ultra-small holes, indentation and capillary areas both in the coating matrix itself and at the metallic substrate. In the presence of halloysite clay, the nanocomposite epoxy coating exhibited a textural structure with little agglomeration (see Fig.\u00a01 e), owing to the hollow cylindrical structure characteristic of the hoalloysite nanoparticles. 3.2 Effect of nanoparticles on the corrosion resistance of the coated steel The corrosion potential, corrosion current, polarization resistance and instantaneous corrosion rate were estimated from the measured potentiodynamic polarization curves of epoxy-coated steel. Fig.\u00a02 a and b shows the temporal evolution of instantaneous corrosion rate of the steel coated by various epoxy coatings, during the 28-day immersion in 0.3 wt.% and 3 wt.% NaCl solutions, respectively. The incorporation of a small amount of nanoparticles (1% by total weight of resin and hardener) into the epoxy coating significantly reduced the corrosion rate of the epoxy-coated steel in both electrolytes, while the beneficial effect of nanoparticles was more pronounced in 0.3 wt.% NaCl solution than in 3 wt.% NaCl solution. After 28 days of immersion, the nanoparticles reduced the corrosion rate of epoxy-coated steel by 638\u20132365 times in 0.3 wt.% NaCl solution and by 11\u2013910 times in 3 wt.% NaCl solution. For the steel protected by the nanocomposite epoxy coatings, its corrosion rate increased by 20\u20131263 times when the chloride concentration increased from 0.051 M (0.3 wt.% NaCl) to 0.51 M (3 wt.% NaCl). Fig.\u00a03 a and b shows the temporal evolution of polarization resistance ( R p ) of the steel coated by various epoxy coatings, in 0.3 wt. % and 3 wt.% NaCl solutions, respectively. The incorporation of nanoparticles into the epoxy coating significantly enhanced the polarization resistance of the epoxy-coated steel in both electrolytes, while the beneficial effect of nanoparticles was more pronounced in 0.3 wt.% NaCl solution than in 3 wt.% NaCl solution. It should be noted that the measured R p consisted of a component characteristic of the coating-electrolyte interface inside the coating (indicating coating porosity/compactness) and another component characteristic of the steel-electrolyte interface (indicating charge transfer resistance). For the nonconductive coatings investigated, the R p of the coated steel in the relatively less corrosive 0.3 wt.% NaCl solution ( Fig.\u00a03 a) can be used to estimate the relative void fractions within the coating matrix, assuming an inverse proportional relationship between the coating compactness and the measured R p . On the other hand, the R p of the coated steel in the relatively more corrosive 3 wt.% NaCl solution ( Fig.\u00a03 b) can be used to estimate the relative corrosion resistance of the steel at the steel-electrolyte interface. Fig.\u00a04 a and b presents the Nyquist diagrams of the steel coated by various epoxy coatings, after 7-day immersion in 0.3 wt.% and 3 wt.% NaCl solutions, respectively. As shown in both figures, the Nyquist diagrams derived from the EIS measurements featured two capacitive loops, with the high-frequency loop (on the left) and the low-frequency loop (on the right) attributed to the resistance and capacitance of the coating and of the steel-electrolyte interface respectively. These experimental EIS curves represent the electrochemical process with two time constants, which are well separated. Equivalent electric circuit is generally used to interpret the EIS data. Equivalent electric circuit with two time constants had been used in [20] for epoxy coated steel with nano Ag pigment in 3.5 wt.% NaCl. In this research, the fitting of all EIS data was performed using a simple equivalent electric circuit model ( Fig.\u00a05 ) with two time constants well separated. The obtained parameters are given in Tables\u00a01 and 2 , where R 1 and C 1 are the resistance and capacitance of coating characteristic of its pore network structure (the coating-electrolyte interface inside the coating), and R 2 and C 2 are the corrosion resistance of the steel and the double layer capacitance on the steel surface (the steel-electrolyte interface) respectively. If the coating was intact, an equivalent electric circuit with only one time constant (instead of two time constants as shown in Fig.\u00a05 ) would be needed for analyzing the EIS data. R 0 is the solution resistance between the reference electrode and the working electrode (nanocomposite coated steel), which depends not only on the resistivity of electrolyte (ionic concentration, type of ions, temperature and so on) but also on the geometry of the area in which current is carried. R 0 is not a property of the coating. Therefore, it is not technically or theoretically important in the analysis of coating performance. The incorporation of a small amount of nanoparticles (1% by total weight of resin and hardener) into the epoxy coating greatly increased the coating resistance R 1 by 6\u20131295 times and reduced the coating capacitance C 1 by 1\u2013112 times, indicating reduced coating porosity and improved barrier performance for corrosion protection of the steel substrate. It was also observed that over the time of immersion in the corrosive electrolytes R 1 decreased and C 1 increased, indicating the entry of electrolyte into the epoxy coatings, which is consistent with previous research [21,22] . The incorporation of nanoparticles into the epoxy coating also significantly increased the charge transfer resistance R 2 by 3\u2013186 times and reduced the double layer capacitance C 2 by 1\u2013484 times, indicating enhanced corrosion resistance of the steel at the steel-electrolyte interface [23] . It should be noted that the charge transfer resistances R 2 obtained by fitting EIS were lower than the polarization resistances R p measured by potentiodynamic polarization curves. A possible explanation is that surface area for steel-electrolyte interface, where steel was directly in contact with electrolyte, was lower than a whole surface area of steel coupon. 3.3 Effect of nanoparticles on the Young's modulus of epoxy coating As the indentation depth in AFM experiments is less than 100 nm and the coating thickness is above 10 \u03bcm, the contribution of steel substrate to the final results is negligible. Fig.\u00a06 presents the force-displacement curves for the control coating (plain epoxy, containing no nanoparticles) and the nanocomposite coatings, which were obtained using the AFM-based nanoindentation technique. The upper (black) curve and the lower (red) curve in each diagram correspond to the loading and the unloading processes of the indentation, respectively. A hysteresis between the loading and unloading curves was observed for all the tested samples, indicating a plastic deformation of the epoxy coatings upon the indentation. The nearly linear slope of the unloading curves in Fig.\u00a06 indicates that the tip indentation resulted in very little elastic deformation and thus the loading curve was fitted to obtain the mechanical properties of the coating. In this work we presume that all the coatings have identical mechanical properties over the whole thickness and the Young's modulus obtained by fitting only the initial part of the loading indentation process to the Hertzain model were presented in Fig.\u00a07 as the representative value of the whole coatings. All the coatings, except the one modified with SiO 2 nanoparticles, showed Young's modulus ranging from \u223c 60 to \u223c 350 MPa, which are comparable to the documented values of 20\u2013560 MPa for organic coatings obtained using similar methods [24] . The epoxy coating modified with SiO 2 nanoparticles showed a significantly enhanced Young's modulus of \u223c 2.5 GPa, which coincided with the much smaller deformation hysteresis in Fig.\u00a06 c relative to other samples ( Fig.\u00a06 a, b, d &e). A smaller increase, \u223c 30%, in Young's modulus was observed for the nano-Zn modified epoxy coating. As shown in Fig.\u00a07 , the modification with nanoparticles does not always enhance the stiffness of the epoxy coatings: the nanoclay and nano-Fe 2 O 3 modified samples showed \u223c 30% and \u223c 25% decrease relative to the unmodified epoxy coating, respectively. The mechanical properties of nanocomposites, represented by Young's modulus in this paper, depend heavily on the integrity and internal properties of the coating surface, since under mechanical stress the micro-voids between the nanoparticles or between the polymer matrix and the nanoparticles may become the origin of cracks. For the epoxy coating modified by SiO 2 nanoparticles with a high specific surface area of 440 m 2 /g, the distinct improvement in its stiffness may be ascribed to the following mechanisms. First, the nanoparticles tend to occupy holidays such as pinholes and voids in the thin-film coating and serve as the bridges in the interconnected matrix, causing a reduction of the total free volume and an enhancement of the cross-linking density of the cured epoxy [13,14] . As such, the cured nanocomposite coating has reduced chain segmental motions and improved stiffness. Second, the SiO 2 nanoparticles may act to prevent epoxy disaggregation during curing and result in a more homogenous coating [13,14] . Finally, the SiO 2 nanoparticles resulted in a reduced viscosity of the epoxy solution in acetone and thus led to a thinner coating layer on the steel, which diminished the internal stress of the cured coating. The addition of other nanoparticles did not affect the Young's modulus of the epoxy coating as prominent as the SiO 2 nanoparticles. We tentatively correlate this result with the lower specific surface areas of Zn and Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles (30\u201350 m 2 /g and \u2265 30 m 2 /g, respectively) relative to SiO 2 . In the case of Fe 2 O 3 , the agglomeration of nanoparticles in the cured nanocomposite coating led to aggravated microcracks on the coating surface, as evidenced by FESEM imaging ( Fig.\u00a01 d), which further weakened the coating and resulted in the smallest Young's modulus among all the tested samples. This highlights the importance of good dispersion of nanoparticles in delivering desirable mechanical properties of nanocomposite epoxy coatings. Unlike the other nanoparticles used this work that possess an approximately spherical geometry, the halloysite clay nanoparticles feature a nanotubular structure with an averages diameter of 30 nm and lengths between 0.5 and 10 \u00b5m [25] . It has been reported that the addition of montmorillonite nanoclay which has a layered structure ((Na,Ca) 0.33 (Al,Mg) 2 (Si 4 O 10 )(OH) 2 \u00b7 n H 2 O), enhanced the modulus of epoxy coatings [26\u201328] . However, our results indicated that the nanoclay modified epoxy coating exhibited a loss in the Young's modulus compared with the plain epoxy coating. Although currently it remains unclear whether the weakening of the nanoclay-epoxy composite in our experiments is associated with the hollow cylindrical structure of the halloysite clay nanoparticles, such a difference suggests that the nanostructures of clay materials may play a significant role in the mechanical properties of epoxy composite coatings. 3.4 Role of nanoparticles in enhancing the anticorrosive performance of epoxy coating According to the EIS data after 7-day immersion in both 0.3 wt.% and 3 wt.% aqueous NaCl solutions ( Tables\u00a01 and 2 ), the incorporation of nanoparticles increased the coating resistance R 1 and the charge transfer resistance R 2 while reducing the coating capacitance C 1 and the double layer capacitance C 2 . This suggests that at least two possible mechanisms contributed to the enhanced corrosion protection of nanocomposite epoxy coating. First, nanoparticles improved the quality of the cured epoxy coating, reduced the porosity of the coating matrix, and zigzagged the diffusion path available by deleterious species, leading to improved barrier performance of the epoxy coating. Second, nanoparticles improved the adherence of the cured epoxy coating to the underlying substrate and altered the physiochemical properties of the coating-steel interface, the specific pathway of which is dependent on the type of nanoparticles as described below. Table\u00a03 provides the open circuit potential (OCP) data of epoxy-coated steel in salt solutions, as a function of nanoparticle type, NaCl concentration and exposure duration. It should be cautioned that the OCP reading of the coated steel was contributed both by the corrosion potential of the steel itself and by the electrical resistance of the coating layer. Incorporating 1 wt.% of nano-Zn particles with a mean diameter of 35 nm into the epoxy coating reduced the corrosion rate of the epoxy-coated steel by 739 and 11 times, respectively, after 28-day immersion in 0.3 wt.% and 3 wt.% aqueous NaCl solutions. In the less corrosive electrolyte (0.3 wt.% NaCl), the OCP of the steel protected by the nano-Zn modified epoxy coating was 0.052 V SCE and \u22120.229 V SCE at 24 h and 672-hours respectively, which were significantly higher than that of the plain-epoxy-coated steel (\u2212 0.457 V SCE and \u22120.584 respectively, as shown in Table\u00a03 ). We speculate that due to the low dosage of Zn in epoxy coating, nano-Zn nanoparticles were quickly consumed to form ZnO, which worked as both an anodic-type inhibitor and a good nano-filler to significantly inhibited corrosion of bare steel. This noble shift in the OCP induced by the Zn nanoparticles decreased over time in 0.3 wt.% NaCl and diminished in the more corrosive electrolyte (3 wt.% NaCl), likely due to the cathodic dissolution of ZnO. It merits further investigation to see whether a higher dosage of ZnO nanoparticles can provide better long-term anti-corrosive performance for the epoxy coating. Zinc-rich primers have been extensively and successfully used for corrosion protection in heavy-duty environments, often involving much higher loading of zinc powder with mm and \u03bcm grain sizes [29,30] . Therefore, we also compared the performance of an epoxy coating with ordinary Zn particles (< 150 \u03bcm, 1% by total weight of resin and hardener) and that of the nano-Zn modified epoxy coating. In the first 24 h of exposure to 3 wt.% NaCl solution, the steel protected by the nano-Zn-modified epoxy coating showed a significantly lower corrosion rate (and similar OCP) than the steel protected by the ordinary-Zn-modified epoxy coating. Yet over time such nano-effect diminished and by the 9th day of immersion the two Zn-modified coatings offered comparable corrosion protection for the underlying steel. It merits further investigation whether increasing the loading of nano-Zn particles in the epoxy coating would significantly improve its long-term anticorrosive performance. Incorporating 1 wt.% of nano-Fe 2 O 3 particles with a mean diameter of 20 nm into the epoxy coating reduced the corrosion rate of the epoxy-coated steel by 2365 and 910 times, respectively, after 28-day immersion in 0.3 wt.% and 3 wt.% aqueous NaCl solutions. In addition to enhancing the coating barrier performance, Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles served as anodic-type corrosion inhibitor to significantly reduce the corrosion of the epoxy-coated steel in both electrolytes. In the less corrosive electrolyte (0.3 wt.% NaCl), the OCP of the steel protected by the nano-Fe 2 O 3 modified epoxy coating was 0.060 V SCE and \u2212 0.049 V SCE at 24 h and 672-hours respectively, which were significantly higher than that of the plain-epoxy-coated steel (\u2212 0.457 V SCE and \u2212 0.584 respectively, as shown in Table\u00a03 ). This noble shift in the OCP induced by the Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles decreased over time in 0.3 wt.% NaCl and was much less apparent in the more corrosive electrolyte (3 wt.% NaCl). It should be noted that the nano-Fe 2 O 3 particles did not disperse very well in the epoxy coating (as shown in Fig.\u00a01 d) and better anti-corrosive performance of the nanocomposite coating can be expected once better dispersion of the nanoparticles is achieved. It is interesting to note that Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles were previously reported to alter the magnetic properties of epoxy resin as well [31] . Traditionally, Fe 2 O 3 pigment with mm and \u03bcm grain sizes was used in protective paint as corrosion inhibitor, and its protective mechanism was considered physical rather than chemical. By mechanically strengthening the paint film, reducing moisture permeation through the film, and screening out destructive UV radiation, Fe 2 O 3 pigments was excellent auxiliary pigments in metal primers and top coats [30] . With improved dispersion in the epoxy matrix, the nano-Fe 2 O 3 particles are expected to provide long-term anticorrosive performance of the epoxy primers. Incorporating 1 wt.% of nano-SiO 2 particles with a mean diameter of 15 nm into the epoxy coating reduced the corrosion rate of the epoxy-coated steel by 983 and 32 times, respectively, after 28-day immersion in 0.3 wt.% and 3 wt.% aqueous NaCl solutions. This is consistent with a previous study [32] , where the incorporation of 1 wt.% nano-SiO 2 particles improved the anticorrosive performance of the epoxy coating on 2024-T3 aluminum alloy. The OCP data in Table\u00a03 suggest that in both electrolytes the corrosion protection offered by the SiO 2 nanoparticles had more to do with the improvement in the coating pore network than any modification of the coating-steel interface. The SiO 2 nanoparticles tend to occupy holidays in the thin-film coating and serve to bridge more molecules in the interconnected matrix, leading to increased cross-linking density of the cured epoxy as well as improved corrosion protection for the steel substrate. Incorporating 1 wt.% of halloysite clay nanoparticles into the epoxy coating reduced the corrosion rate of the epoxy-coated steel by 638 and 614 times, respectively, after 28-day immersion in 0.3 wt.% and 3 wt.% aqueous NaCl solutions. In the less corrosive electrolyte (0.3 wt.% NaCl), the OCP of the steel protected by the halloysite clay nanoparticles modified epoxy coating was \u22120.170 V SCE and \u2212 0.237 V SCE at 24 h and 672-hours respectively, which were significantly higher than that of the plain-epoxy-coated steel (\u2212 0.457 V SCE and \u2212 0.584 respectively, as shown in Table\u00a03 ). The experimental results suggest that halloysite nanoclay caused the noble shift in the OCP of the epoxy-coated steel and significantly inhibited its corrosion, in the case of 0.3 wt.% NaCl. In the more aggressive electrolyte (3% NaCl), even though the halloysite clay still provided strong corrosion protection for the steel substrate, the noble shift in the OCP was no longer evident, likely due to the cathodic dissolution of aluminum oxide or hydroxide. Our findings are consistent with previous research in terms of beneficial effect of nanoclay on the anticorrosive performance of coatings. By incorporating 2\u20136 wt.% montmorillonite nanoclay into the polyurethane coating, Chen-Yang et al. [33] demonstrated that the corrosion rate of coated stainless steel in 5 wt.% NaCl solution was reduced by about 10\u201330 times. Yeh et al. [34] reported that the corrosion rate of coated steel in 5 wt.% NaCl solution could be reduced by about 10 times when incorporating 1 wt.% montmorillonite nanoclay into the siloxane-modified epoxy coating. In our study, the halloysite nanoclays were found to drastically enhance the polarization resistance ( R p ) of the coated steel, which was 15 M\u03a9\u2219cm 2 after 1 h in 3 wt.% NaCl. This value is much higher than R p of the steel coated by polyurethane/montmorillonite nanocomposite coatings (300 K\u03a9\u2219cm 2 after 30 min in 5 wt.% NaCl, [33] , and R p of the stainless steel coated by siloxane-modified epoxy/montmorillonite nanocomposite coatings (400\u2013600 K\u03a9\u2219cm 2 after 5 h in 5 wt.% NaCl, [34] ). 4 Conclusions Nanoparticles of Zn, SiO 2 , Fe 2 O 3 and halloysite clay were successfully dispersed into epoxy resin matrix at a concentration of 1% by the total weight of epoxy resin and its hardener. The electrochemical monitoring of the coated steel over 28 days of immersion in both 0.3 wt.% and 3 wt.% NaCl solutions suggested the beneficial role of nanoparticles in significantly improving the corrosion resistance of the coated steel, with the Fe 2 O 3 and halloysite clay nanoparticles being the best. The potentiodynamic weak polarization test revealed that after 28 days of immersion the nanoparticles reduced the corrosion rate of epoxy-coated steel by 638\u20132365 times in 0.3 wt.% NaCl solution and by 11\u2013910 times in 3 wt.% NaCl solution. The EIS measurements indicated that the incorporation of nanoparticles increased the coating resistance R 1 and the charge transfer resistance R 2 while reducing the coating capacitance C 1 and the double layer capacitance C 2 . In addition to enhancing the coating barrier performance, at least another mechanism was at work to account for the role of the nanoparticles in improving the anticorrosive performance of these epoxy coatings. The epoxy coating modified with SiO 2 nanoparticles showed a significantly enhanced Young's modulus of \u223c 2.5 GPa. Nonetheless, the modification with nanoparticles does not always enhance the stiffness of the epoxy coatings. A \u223c30% increase in Young's modulus was observed for the nano-Zn modified epoxy coating, whereas the nanoclay and nano-Fe 2 O 3 modified samples showed \u223c30% and \u223c25% decrease relative to the unmodified epoxy coating, respectively. For future research, it would be important to investigate the combined use of Fe 2 O 3 , SiO 2 and halloysite clay nanoparticles and examine the potential synergy between them to allow simultaneous improvements in both anticorrosion and mechanical properties of epoxy coating. A nano-Fe 2 O 3 and/or nanoclay modified epoxy primer with a nano-SiO 2 pigmented topcoat would be an interesting system to explore. It is also necessary to investigate ways to improve dispersion of the nanoparticles in the coating matrix and make the transition from solvent-based to waterborne epoxy. More in-depth study of the effect of nanoparticles on epoxy-curing dynamics and kinetics would further advance the knowledge base of such nanocomopsite coating systems. To enable long-term anticorrosive performance of the nanocomposite coatings, one should also investigate the potential application of the nanoparticles as reservoirs for the storage and prolonged lease of corrosion inhibitors. For instance, corrosion inhibitors can be absorbed by the nanoparticles and released only during contact with moisture, thus endowing the coating with self-healing properties [16] .

The flexural strength of the nanomodified TiO 2 Portland cement paste reached the highest value with a dosage of 1.0 mass %. The SEM observation shows that admixing of the TiO2 nanoparticles largely decreased the quantity of internal microcracks in the cement paste.

Atomic force microscopy was introduced to observe the microstructure of nanomodified Portland cement paste, and the results show that the nanoroughness of the hardened cement pastes with admixed TiO2 nanoparticles was much lower than that without the TiO2 nanoparticle addition.

        "abstract": "For snow and ice control on winter roads, the direct cost of corrosion-inhibited chemicals can be much higher than that of the non-inhibited chemicals. Yet, prior to this work, little was known about how long the corrosion inhibitors and the anti-icing products remain effective on the pavement once applied. This case study investigated the longevity of inhibitors and the performance of corrosion-inhibited anti-icing products after pavement application during winter storms. The field operational tests included the daily sampling of anti-icer residuals on the pavement for seven days after anti-icer application for a black ice event, a man-made snow event, and a natural snow event, respectively. Subsequently, multiple analytical methods were used to examine the properties of pavement-collected samples in the laboratory. It was found that more than 62% of the inhibitor in the CCB anti-icer and more than 20% of the chlorides (especially for FreezGard and NaCl+GLT) could remain on the pavement four days after the application of liquid anti-icers to treat black ice. The longevity of chlorides and inhibitors on the pavement after anti-icer application can vary greatly depending on the pavement temperature, the amount of precipitation, etc. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Arc sprayed zinc (Zn) anode on concrete surfaces has been an emerging technology for protecting reinforced concrete structures from rebar corrosion in coastal environments. Many cathodic protection (CP) systems with arc sprayed Zn anodes will reach or exceed their design life in the near future and thus may function improperly or insufficiently, making it necessary to replace the aged anodes. However, prior to this study, little was known about the most effective profile for the concrete surface, for either new concrete or old concrete with existing Zn anodes removed. This work develops criteria to properly prepare the concrete surface before the application of new Zn anode. Experimental studies were conducted both in the laboratory and for a field structure in Oregon. Artificial neural network was used to achieve better understanding of the complex cause-and-effect relationships inherent in the Zn-mortar or Zn\u2013concrete systems and was successful in finding meaningful, logical results from the bond strength data. The goal is to achieve strong initial bond strength of new Zn to concrete, which is essential for long-term performance of the CP system. The results from this case study suggest that it is necessary to adjust the anode removal and surface sandblasting based on the electrochemical age of the existing concrete. In all cases of sandblasting, minimize the exposure of large aggregates (e.g., those bigger than 19 mm in diameter).",

In the past few decades, electroosmosis has been proved to be a versatile strategy to consolidate soil in situ. However, the efficiency of this electrochemical technique needs to be further improved for practical application. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the incorporation of nanoparticles (NPs) during electroosmosis can significantly facilitate the migration of water molecules under an external electric field and thus improve the physical properties of the treated soil. In addition, the number of anodes per cathode was explored as another method to improve the efficiency of electroosmosis in dewatering and strengthening soil. The results from the designed laboratory experiments confirmed the benefits of increasing the number of anodes or adding positively charged SiO2@Al2O3 core\u2013shell NPs, in increasing the dewatering rate and improving the cohesion, internal friction angle, and microstructure of the treated soil (Lake Silt). The finite element method based simulation results agreed well with the experimental observations and suggested that the NPs can promote the water migration under an electric field.",

At the microscopic level, this treatment process is inherently complex due to in situ chemical and electrochemical reactions, migration of ions and particles, and the dependence of zeta potential of various particles on the local pH value in the soil. This complexity has hindered further understanding of mechanisms underlying the electroosmosis technology. Here, we design an external electric field in which alternating pulse wave potentials were partially used to adjust the pH value of the soil and manipulate the dynamics of in situ formed nanoparticles and their interconnectivity. The experimental results reveal that the in situ formation of Ca-rich particles, instead of water drainage, may serve as the main mechanism underlying the observed soil reinforcement when using calcium chloride as the treatment electrolyte. The interconnectivity of such particles ma...",

GO is highly soluble in water, and its accumulation in soil could significantly alter the physical and mechanical properties of the soil. In this laboratory study, we mixed GO with a soil (clayey sand, SC) to systematically study the engineering properties and microstructure of the modified soil. The experimental results reveal that the physical and mechanical properties and microstructure of clayey sand can be significantly changed by the addition of a minute quantity of GO. The liquid limit and plasticity index of the soil steadily increased (up to a GO concentration of 0.08 wt%), whereas the plastic limit did not change significantly. The addition of GO (up to 0.08 wt%) into the soil generally decreased the soilu0027s void ratio under a given hydrostatic consolidation pressure, while increasing its undrained shear strength. Such remarkable modifications of soil by minute amounts of GO can be attributed to the extremely high specific surface area of GO and its stable dispersion in water.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This work presents a laboratory study conducted to evaluate the potential impacts of different graphene oxide (GO) dosages on properties of non-modified binder and SBS modified binder. The effects of GO on viscosity, rheological properties, creep and recovery behavior, cracking resistance, and thermal properties of unaged/RTFO aged binders were characterized respectively. It was demonstrated that the addition of trace amounts of GO (no more than 0.2\u202fwt%) enhanced the paving temperature (120\u2013135\u202f\u00b0C) viscosity, high-temperature elasticity and rutting resistance of non-modified/SBS modified binders. The performance improvements were attributed to an increase in the crosslinking degree of the binders induced by the GO. The amount of GO needed to improve the high-temperature performance of the non-modified binder is smaller than that needed for the SBS modified binder. The modification mechanism of GO to non-modified binder includes both chemical reactions and physical blending, whereas it only entails physical blending in the case of SBS modified binder.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A hot mix asphalt binder (HMAB), PG 64-22 with 0.05\u00a0wt.% graphene oxide (GO), was used to prepare warm mix asphalt binders (WMABs) with three types of warm mix additives, i.e, 3\u00a0wt.% Sasobit, 5\u00a0wt.% waste cooking oil (WCO), and Sasobit\u00a0+\u00a0WCO. The viscosity-temperature performance, rheological performance, low-temperature cracking behavior, Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrum, and low-temperature thermal properties of various HMABs and WMABs were investigated in the laboratory. The experimental results revealed that GO remarkably increased the viscosity, high-temperature elasticity and permanent deformation resistance of the non-modified PG 64-22 asphalt binder. When used individually or in combination, Sasobit and WCO can significantly decrease the viscosity of GO-modified asphalt, and reduce the suitable construction temperatures of asphalt paving. Modification of asphalt by the admixtures of GO and Sasobit results in excellent high-temperature properties but compromised the low-temperature performance of the asphalt, thus making it more suitable for hot-climate regions. On the other hand, modification of asphalt by the admixtures of GO and WCO exhibited the exact opposite trend, making it more suitable for cold-climate regions. The GO\u00a0+\u00a0Sasobit\u00a0+\u00a0WCO composite modified asphalt exhibited excellent properties both in high and low temperatures, implying its suitability for all climatic regions. The Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) results suggested that WCO significantly decreased the  T   g   of the non-modified asphalt but Sasobit did not and both of them can enhance the crosslinking degree of asphalt. The FTIR results suggested that the modification of asphalt by the admixtures of GO and warm mix additive (Sasobit or WCO) entailed both chemical reaction and physical blending.",

        "abstract": "The development of effective anticorrosion pre-treatments for metallic substrates is an issue of great importance for durability of metal structures and components. In this work, we proposed and demonstrated the concept of self-repairing coating for corrosion protection of aluminum alloys, using cagelike oil core/silica gel shell particles. These micron-scale, cagelike smart microspheres with opened and closed pores were successfully fabricated, and at the same time encapsulated repairing agent (methyl methacrylate) and catalysts (potassium persulfate and sodium thiosulfate) into the microspheres, respectively. Such smart particle composites (SPCs) were prepared based on an interfacial self-assembly process and sol\u2013gel reaction. They were then self-assembled on the AA2024 aluminum alloy surface, followed by the application of a sol\u2013gel film. The hybrid film worked as a primer coating featuring the self-repairing property. Both the EIS and SEM/EDS data demonstrated that the encapsulated repairing agent was released as a response to external stimulus (scratches) and polymerized to repair the coating defects. By comparing the corrosion rate of AA2024 in three coating systems, the self-repairing effect is quantified to be 22% after 2 h immersion in deoxidized 3% NaCl solution.",

        "abstract": "Several molecular detection marker genes specific for a number of individual Salmonella serogroups have been recently identified in our lab by comparative genomics for the genotyping of diverse serogroups. To further understand the correlation between serotype and genotype, the function of a Salmonella serogroup-C1-specific gene (SC_2092) was analyzed in this study. It was indicated from the topological prediction using the deduced amino acid sequence of SC_2092 that this putative protein was highly similar to the confirmed Wzx flippases. Furthermore, SDS-PAGE revealed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis, specifically O-antigen synthesis, was incomplete in an SC_2092 in-frame deletion mutant, and no agglutination reaction with the O7 antibody was exhibited in this mutant. Therefore, it was revealed that this Salmonella serogroup-C1-specific gene SC_2092 encoded a putative flippase, which was required for O7-polysaccharide biosynthesis, and was designated here as wzxC1. Subsequently, the effects of the deletion of wzxC1 on bacterial motility and sodium chloride (NaCl) tolerance were evaluated. The wzxC1 mutant lacked swarming motility on solid surfaces and was impaired in swimming motility in soft agar. Moreover, microscopic examination and RT-qPCR exhibited that an increased auto-aggregation and a strong defect in flagella expression, respectively, were responsible for the reduced motility in this mutant. In addition, the wzxC1 mutant was more sensitive than the wild-type strain to NaCl, and auto-aggregation of mutant cells was observed immediately up on the addition of 1% NaCl to the medium. Interestingly, the motility deficiency of the mutant strain, as well as the cell agglomeration and the decrease in flagellar expression, were relieved in a NaCl-free medium. This is the first study to experimentally demonstrate a connection between a Salmonella serogroup specific gene identified by comparative genomics with the synthesis of a specific O-antigen biosynthesis. Also, our results show that the mutation of wzxC1 triggers a NaCl-dependent motility deficiency.",

        "abstract": "Acid adaptation in Salmonella Enteritidis was characterized by phenotypic and gene-expression analyses. S. Enteritidis cells at log-phase and stationary-phase were kept at pH 4.5 to 6.0 for 1 to 4 hours. All treatments induced various levels of acid tolerance response that were dependent on pH, exposure time and growth phase. This acid adaptation resulted in tolerance to 50 \u00b0C and 8% NaCl regardless of the growth phase. However, the tolerance of log-phase and stationary-phase cells to low temperatures (4 and ?20 \u00b0C) was increased and decreased, respectively. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that genes involved in tolerance to acid (SEN1564A and cfa), heat (rpoH, uspB, and htrA), salt (proP, proV, and osmW), and cold (cspA, cspC, and csdA) stress were generally upregulated after acid adaptation. These results provide an initial insight into mechanisms of acid adaptation and induced cross protection in S. Enteritidis. Practical Application Stress tolerance acquisition resulting from acid adaptation in foodborne pathogens poses a great threat to food safety. The current work showed that acid adaptation induced direct tolerance and cross-tolerance to high temperature, low temperature, and salt in Salmonella Enteritidis, possibly due to the upregulation of stress tolerance-related genes. These results provide key insights into acid adaptation mechanisms and efficient control of S. Enteritidis.",

A total of 146 Salmonella Enteritidis isolates obtained from retail chicken products in Shanghai, China were characterized for their antimicrobial susceptibilities, virulence and antibiotic resistance gene profiles, and molecular subtypes using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Approximately 42% (61/146) of the isolates were susceptible to all 13 antimicrobials tested. More than half of the isolates (50.70%) were resistant to ampicillin, 49.32% to sulfisoxazole, 17.12% to tetracycline, and 15.75% to doxycycline. Thirty (20.55%) isolates were resistant to three or more antimicrobials. The avrA, mgtC, and sopE virulence genes were identified in all isolates, while 97.2% and 92.4% were positive for bcfC and spvC genes, respectively. Genes associated with resistance to streptomycin (aadA), \u03b2-lactams (blaTEM, blaCMY, blaSHV, and blaCTX), tetracycline (tetA and tetB), and sulfonamides (sulI, sulII, and sulIII) were detected among corresponding resistant isolates. A total of 41 PFGE patterns were identified from 77 antimicrobial resistance (AMR) isolates and were primarily grouped into seven clusters (A-G), each with 90% similarity. The majority of Salmonella Enteritidis isolates (63.63%, 49/77) shared the same PFGE cluster, indicating potential cross contamination during processing and cutting or working during retailing and marketing. A significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) lower percentage (<25%) of isolates belonging to clusters D and E were resistant to sulfisoxazole compared with those belonging to clusters A, B, C, F, and G (>80%), indicating that sulfisoxazole resistance might be associated with genetic content (PFGE profiles) of Salmonella Enteritidis. This study provides important and updated information about the baseline antimicrobial-resistant data for food safety risk assessment of Salmonella Enteritidis from retailed chicken in Shanghai, which is the first step for the development and implementation of China's AMR National Action Plan, and can be helpful for future surveillance activities to ensure the safety of the chicken supply.",

Detection of S. enterica and its classification into serovars are essential for food safety surveillance and clinical diagnosis. The PCR method is useful for these applications because of its rapidity and high accuracy. We obtained 412 candidate detection targets for S. enterica using a comparative genomics mining approach. Gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis of these candidate targets revealed that the GO term with the largest number of unigenes with known function (38 of 177, 21.5%) was significantly involved in pathogenesis (P u003c 10\u221224). All the candidate targets were then evaluated by PCR assays. Fifteen targets showed high specificity for the detection of S. enterica by verification with 151 S. enterica strains and 34 non-Salmonella strains. The phylogenetic trees of verified targets were highly comparable with those of housekeeping genes, especially for differentiating S. enteri...",

In this study, their subtypes were evaluated by serotyping and multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and their genetic profiles were also characterized. It was demonstrated by serotyping on these isolates that 36 various serovars were obtained in this study, of which three serotypes S. Babelsberg, S. Fresno, and S. II were first found in mainland China. Based on Simpson's index of diversity, the serotyping method had a 0.943 discriminatory power. Meanwhile, there were a total of 42 unique sequence types (STs) characterized by MLST, and the discriminatory power of MLST (D = 0.947) was close to that of the serotyping method. In MLST, hisD revealed the highest levels of nucleotide diversity. In addition, ST-92 was the most common ST represented by 16 Salmonella isolates, followed by ST-367 which was represented by 14 isolates. Seven new alleles were identified, which were associated with other alleles and resulted in the assignment of nine new STs. It was concluded from the results that MLST was generally associated with serotype, but not associated with the epidemiological source of the samples, and antimicrobial resistance patterns.",

        "abstract": " The primary aim of this study was to investigate the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and plasmid replicon types for 75 multidrug-resistant (MDR)  Enteritidis isolates from children with gastroenteritis. We also evaluated the association among biofilm formation,  invasion capacity, and antibiotic resistance phenotypes.  Twenty-two ARGs and 18 different plasmid incompatibility types were investigated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing.  invasion capacity of  Enteritidis isolates possessing different antibiotic resistance patterns was assessed using the Caco2 human intestinal epithelial cell line and biofilm formation was performed in a 96-well polystyrene well format using crystal violet detection.  The presence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes and \u03b2-lactamase genes was established using PCR amplification. All the tested  Enteritidis isolates that were fluoroquinolone resistant possessed  mutations and 50% also possessed mutations in . MDR  Enteritidis isolates containing three (29/75) or four (21/75) plasmid replicon types were predominant and 71/75 carried both FIIs and FIC replicon-type plasmids. MDR isolates were strong or moderate biofilm producers and a significant positive association (\u2009<\u20090.05) between antibiotic resistance and biomass of biofilms was observed in the strains assayed. A ceftiofur-resistant strain was significantly more invasive (\u2009<\u20090.01) than the other isolates.  We observed a high incidence of ARGs and diversity of plasmids in  Enteritidis isolates from children. Biofilm formation and invasion capacity highlight a significant hazard to public health.",

S. enterica-specific sequences were identified by a comparative genomic approach. Several species-specific target sequences were evaluated for specificity. A real-time PCR assay was developed targeting a nucleotide sequence within the putative type III secretion ATP synthase gene (ssaN). An internal amplification control (IAC) probe was designed by randomly shuffling the target probe sequence and a single-stranded oligonucleotide was synthesized to serve as an IAC. The assay demonstrated 100% inclusivity for the 40 Salmonella strains tested and 100% exclusivity for 24 non-Salmonella strains. The detection limit of the real-time PCR assay was 41.2 fg/PCR with Salmonella Typhimurium genomic DNA and 18.6 fg/PCR using Salmonella Enteritidis genomic DNA; 8 and 4 genome equivalents, respectively. In the presence of a natural background flora derived from chicken meat enrichment cultures, the sample preparation and PCR method were capable of detecting as few as 130 Salmonella cfu/mL. Using the developed real-time PCR method to detect Salmonella in artificially contaminated chicken, liquid egg and peanut butter samples, as few as 1 cfu/10 g of sample was detectable after a brief (6h) non-selective culture enrichment.",

        "abstract": "This report presents SMM-system, a software package that implements various personalized pre- and post-BLASTN tasks for mining specific markers of microbial pathogens. The main functionalities of SMM-system are summarized as follows: (i) converting multi-FASTA file, (ii) cutting interesting genomic sequence, (iii) automatic high-throughput BLASTN searches, and (iv) screening target sequences. The utility of SMM-system was demonstrated by using it to identify 214 Salmonella enterica-specific protein-coding sequences (CDSs). Eighteen primer pairs were designed based on eighteen S. enterica-specific CDSs, respectively. Seven of these primer pairs were validated with PCR assay, which showed 100% inclusivity for the 101 S. enterica genomes and 100% exclusivity of 30 non-S. enterica genomes. Three specific primer pairs were chosen to develop a multiplex PCR assay, which generated specific amplicons with a size of 180bp (SC1286), 238bp (SC1598) and 405bp (SC4361), respectively. This study demonstrates that SMM-system is a high-throughput specific marker generation tool that can be used to identify genus-, species-, serogroup- and even serovar-specific DNA sequences of microbial pathogens, which has a potential to be applied in food industries, diagnostics and taxonomic studies. SMM-system is freely available and can be downloaded from http://foodsafety.sjtu.edu.cn/SMM-system.html.",

        "abstract": "Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) encounters mild ethanol stress during its life cycle. However, adaptation to a stressful condition may affect bacterial resistance to subsequent stresses. Hence, this work was undertaken to investigate the influences of ethanol adaptation on stress tolerance of S. Enteritidis.S. Enteritidis was subjected to different ethanol adaptation treatments (2.5-10% ethanol for 1 h). Cellular morphology and tolerance to subsequent environmental stresses (15% ethanol, -20\u00b0C, 4\u00b0C, 50\u00b0C and 10% NaCl) were evaluated. It was found that 10% was the maximum ethanol concentration that allowed growth of the target bacteria. Ethanol adaptation did not cause cell-surface damage in S. Enteritidis as revealed by membrane permeability measurements and electron micrograph analysis. S. Enteritidis adapted with 2.5-10% ethanol displayed an enhanced resistance to a 15%-ethanol challenge compared with an unchallenged control. The maximum ethanol resistance was observed when ethanol concentration used for ethanol adaptation was increased to 5.0%. Additionally, pre-adaptation to 5.0% ethanol cross-protected S. Enteritidis against -20\u00b0C, but not against 4\u00b0C, 50\u00b0C or 10% NaCl.Ethanol adaptation provided S. Enteritidis direct protection from a high level ethanol challenge and cross protection from freezing, but not other stresses tested (low temperature, high salinity or high temperature).The results are valuable in developing adequate and efficient control measures for S. Enteritidis in foods. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (Salmonella Enteritidis) is a globally important foodborne pathogen, and the contaminated chicken eggs are the major source of salmonellosis in humans. Salmonella Enteritidis strains are differentially susceptible to the hostile environment of egg whites. Strains with superior survival ability in egg whites are more likely to contaminate eggs and consequently infect humans. However, the genetic basis for this phenotype is unclear. We characterized two Salmonella Enteritidis strains isolated from chicken meat that had similar genetic backgrounds but large differences in survival ability in egg whites. Although genome comparisons indicated that the gene content and genomic synteny were highly conserved, variations including six insertions or deletions (INDELs) and 70 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were observed between the two genomes. Of these, 38 variations including four INDELs and 34 non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNP) were annotated to result in amino acid substitutions or INDELs in coding proteins. These variations were located in 38 genes involved in lysozyme inhibition, vitamin biosynthesis, cell division and DNA damage response, osmotic and oxidative protection, iron-related functions, cell envelope maintenance, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, antimicrobial resistance and type III secretion system. We carried out allelic replacements for two nsSNPs in bioC (biotin synthesis) and pliC (lysozyme inhibition), and two INDELs in ftsK and yqiJ (DNA damage response) by homologous recombination, and these replacements did not alter the bacterial survival ability in egg whites. However, the bacterial survival ability in egg whites was reduced when deletion mutation of the genes bioC and pliC occurred. This study provides initial correlations between observed genotypes and phenotypes and serves as an important caveat for further functional studies.",

        "abstract": "Comparative genomic approaches provide abundant information to reveal the diversity among Salmonella serogroups. In a local genomic sequence database, twenty-five Salmonella whole genomic sequences were divided into 6 (A, B, C1, C2, D and others) serogroups for mining the DNA fragments specific for serogroups A through D. For each serogroup, a reference sequence was selected and split into 1000-bp fragments in silico to align against all the other genomic sequences to obtain one or more serogroup-specific fragments. As a result, 2, 6, 7, 10, and 7 specific fragments were found for A, B, C1, C2 and D serogroups, respectively. Specific primer sets targeting these DNA fragments were designed for multiplex PCR assays identifying 21 Salmonella standard strains and 86 additional food isolates. The PCR results demonstrated good agreement with those from Salmonella serotyping. This means that the PCR assay may be able to identify 5 (A, B, C1, C2 and D) Salmonella serogroups and elucidate differences among them. Based on the gene annotations, the 32 serogroup-specific fragments were divided into 3 categories (membrane protein genes, rfb gene clusters, and fimbrial genes). Each gene from these three groups was conserved within the serogroup and was closely correlated with phenotypic characterization. This finding implies that these genes, which are associated with sugar synthesis and metabolism or glycosyl and O-actetyl transfer, impart the differences among Salmonella serogroups.",

        "abstract": "Acid adaptation in Salmonella Enteritidis was characterized by phenotypic and gene-expression analyses. S. Enteritidis cells at log-phase and stationary-phase were kept at pH 4.5 to 6.0 for 1 to 4 hours. All treatments induced various levels of acid tolerance response that were dependent on pH, exposure time and growth phase. This acid adaptation resulted in tolerance to 50 \u00b0C and 8% NaCl regardless of the growth phase. However, the tolerance of log-phase and stationary-phase cells to low temperatures (4 and -20 \u00b0C) was increased and decreased, respectively. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that genes involved in tolerance to acid (SEN1564A and cfa), heat (rpoH, uspB, and htrA), salt (proP, proV, and osmW), and cold (cspA, cspC, and csdA) stress were generally upregulated after acid adaptation. These results provide an initial insight into mechanisms of acid adaptation and induced cross protection in S. Enteritidis. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Stress tolerance acquisition resulting from acid adaptation in foodborne pathogens poses a great threat to food safety. The current work showed that acid adaptation induced direct tolerance and cross-tolerance to high temperature, low temperature, and salt in Salmonella Enteritidis, possibly due to the upregulation of stress tolerance-related genes. These results provide key insights into acid adaptation mechanisms and efficient control of S. Enteritidis.",

        "abstract": "The survival mechanism of  serovar Enteritidis in antibacterial egg white is not fully understood. In our lab, an egg white-resistant strain,  Enteritidis SJTUF 10978, was identified. Cell envelope damage and osmotic stress response (separation of cell wall and inner membrane as well as cytoplasmic shrinkage) of this strain surviving in egg white were identified through microscopic observation. RNA-Seq analysis of the transcriptome of  survival in egg white showed that a considerable number of genes involved in DNA damage repair, alkaline pH adaptation, osmotic stress adaptation, envelope damage repair,  pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2), iron absorption, and biotin synthesis were significantly upregulated (fold change \u2265 2) in egg white, indicating that these pathways or genes might be critical for bacterial survival. RNA-Seq results were confirmed by qRT-PCR, and the survival analysis of six gene deletion mutants confirmed their importance in the survival of bacteria in egg white. The importance of alkaline pH adaptation and envelope damage repair for  to survive in egg white were further confirmed by analysis of , , , and  deletion mutants. According to the RNA-Seq results, we propose that alkaline pH adaptation might be the cause of bacterial osmotic stress phenotype and that the synergistic effect between alkaline pH and other inhibitory factors can enhance the bacteriostatic effect of egg white. Moreover,  and  were recognized as the central regulators that coordinate bacterial metabolism to adapt to envelope damage and alkaline pH.  serovar Enteritidis is a major foodborne pathogen that causes salmonellosis mainly through contaminated chicken eggs or egg products and has been a worldwide public health threat since 1980. Frequent outbreaks of this serotype through eggs correlate significantly with its exceptional survival ability in the antibacterial egg white. Research on the survival mechanism of  Enteritidis in egg white will help to further understand the complex and highly effective antibacterial mechanisms of egg white and lay the foundation for the development of safe and effective vaccines to prevent egg contamination by this  serotype. Key pathways and genes that were previously overlooked under bactericidal conditions were characterized as being induced in egg white, and synergistic effects between different antimicrobial factors appear to exist according to the gene expression changes. Our work provides new insights into the survival mechanism of  Enteritidis in egg white.",

        "abstract": " serovar Enteritidis ( Enteritidis) is able to adapt to sublethal concentrations of ethanol, which subsequently induce the tolerance of this pathogen to normally lethal ethanol challenges. This work aimed to elucidate the underlying ethanol adaptation mechanisms of  Enteritidis by proteomic and mutagenic analyses. The global proteomic response of  Enteritidis to ethanol adaptation (5% ethanol for 1 h) was determined by iTRAQ and it was found that a total of 138 proteins were differentially expressed in ethanol-adapted cells compared to those in non-adapted cells. Fifty-six upregulated proteins were principally associated with purine metabolism and transporters for glycine betaine, phosphate, D-alanine, thiamine and heme; whereas 82 downregulated proteins were mainly involved in enterobactin biosynthesis and uptake, ribosome, flagellar assembly as well as virulence. Moreover, mutagenic analysis further revealed the functions of two highly upregulated proteins belonging to purine metabolism (HiuH, 5-hydroxyisourate hydrolase) and glycine betaine transport (ProX, glycine betaine-binding periplasmic protein) pathways. Deletion of either  or  resulted in the development of stronger ethanol tolerance response, suggesting their negative regulatory roles in ethanol adaptation. Collectively, this work suggested that  Enteritidis employs multiple strategies to coordinate ethanol adaptation. Stress adaptation in foodborne pathogens has been recognized as a food safety concern since it may compromise currently-employed microbial intervention strategies. While adaptation to sublethal levels of ethanol is able to induce ethanol tolerance in foodborne pathogens, the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is poorly characterized. Hence, global proteomic analysis and mutagenic analysis were conducted in the current work to understand the strategies employed by  serovar Enteritidis to respond to ethanol adaptation. It was revealed that coordinated regulation of multiple pathways involving metabolism, ABC transporter, regulator, enterobactin biosynthesis and uptake, ribosome, flagella and virulence was responsible for the development of ethanol adaptation response in this pathogen. Such knowledge will undoubtedly contribute to the development and implementation of more effective food safety interventions.",

        "abstract": "Salmonella producing \u03b2-lactamases has spread rapidly worldwide and poses a serious threat to human and animal health. In this study, we characterized 220 ceftriaxone (CRO)-resistant isolates identified among 3153 Salmonella from humans, animals, food, and water collected in Shanghai, China. They were assessed for antimicrobial susceptibility, phenotypic identification of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases (ESBLs), and \u03b2-lactamase genes and integrons. CRO resistance in Salmonella increased from 5.0% in 2011 to 8.4% in 2013. Salmonella Enteritidis (45.5%), Salmonella Typhimurium (20.9%) from humans, and Salmonella Indiana (14.5%) from poultry represented the majority of the CRO-resistant isolates. Many isolates were also resistant to other antimicrobials, including nalidixic acid (84.5%), sulfisoxazole (70.5%), and tetracycline (61.8%). Resistance to ciprofloxacin was also found in 33.6% of the isolates. Most isolates (98.2%) were confirmed as ESBL producers. Resistance genes such as bla, bla, and bla were detected in 207 (94.1%), 99 (45%), and 53 (24.1%) isolates, respectively. Three types of integron I and one type of integron II were identified in 13 (5.9%) and 2 (0.9%) isolates, respectively. The integrons encompassed 10 different genes: dfrA1/12/17/25, aadA1/2/5, sat2, orfF, and ybeA. Our study underscores concern for increasing CRO resistance, and highlights the widespread ESBL genes in Salmonella enterica.",

        "abstract": "Disease caused by nontyphoidal serotypes of Salmonella enterica is the leading cause of foodborne illness worldwide. Many serotypes have also developed resistance to antimicrobials commonly used for the treatment of salmonellosis. Here we analyze 179 ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates identified among 3680 Salmonella isolated from humans, food, animals, and water collected in Shanghai, China. They were assessed for antimicrobial susceptibility, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants, and mutations in quinolone resistance determination regions (QRDRs); genetic relatedness was examined using PFGE. Ciprofloxacin resistance in Salmonella increased from 2.3% in 2006 to 5.9% in 2012. Multidrug resistance was common, and most carried mutations in QRDR (97.2%) and PMQR determinants (71.5%). Mutations frequently included changes in gyrA: Ser83Phe (53.6%) and Asp87Asn (35.8%), and in parC: Thr57Ser (53.1%) and Ser80Arg (44.1%). Mutations in parC and parE without changes in gyrA were identified in S. Derby and most S. Thompson. Among PMQR determinants, aac(6')-Ib-cr (62.0%) and oqxA/oqxB (33.5%/33.0%) were most common, and conferred resistance without target mutations in five S. Typhimurium isolates. PFGE analysis revealed that S. Typhimurium, isolated from pork and aquatic products, and S. Indiana, isolated from chicken, were highly similar to isolates from humans, suggesting these products be the major source of ciprofloxacin-resistant infections. Our findings highlight the important role QRDRs and PMQR play in ciprofloxacin resistance of Salmonella, and reveal the potential sources of the pathogen associated with human infections.",

        "abstract": " serovar Enteritidis ( Enteritidis) is a globally important foodborne pathogen, and the contaminated chicken eggs are the major source of salmonellosis in humans.  Enteritidis strains are differentially susceptible to the hostile environment of egg whites. Strains with superior survival ability in egg whites are more likely to contaminate eggs and consequently infect humans. However, the genetic basis for this phenotype is unclear. We characterized two  Enteritidis strains isolated from chicken meat that had similar genetic backgrounds but large differences in survival ability in egg whites. Although genome comparisons indicated that the gene content and genomic synteny were highly conserved, variations including six insertions or deletions (INDELs) and 70 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were observed between the two genomes. Of these, 38 variations including four INDELs and 34 non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNP) were annotated to result in amino acid substitutions or INDELs in coding proteins. These variations were located in 38 genes involved in lysozyme inhibition, vitamin biosynthesis, cell division and DNA damage response, osmotic and oxidative protection, iron-related functions, cell envelope maintenance, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, antimicrobial resistance, and type III secretion system. We carried out allelic replacements for two nsSNPs in  (biotin synthesis) and  (lysozyme inhibition), and two INDELs in  and  (DNA damage response) by homologous recombination, and these replacements did not alter the bacterial survival ability in egg whites. However, the bacterial survival ability in egg whites was reduced when deletion mutation of the genes  and  occurred. This study provides initial correlations between observed genotypes and phenotypes and serves as an important caveat for further functional studies.",

        "abstract": "Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) is a food-borne bacterial pathogen that can cause human salmonellosis predominately by contamination of eggs and egg products. However, its survival mechanisms in egg white are not fully understood, especially from a proteomic point of view. In this study, the proteomic profiles of S. Enteritidis in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth containing 50% and 80% egg white, and in whole egg white were compared with the profile in LB broth using iTRAQ technology to identify key proteins that were involved in S. Enteritidis survival in egg white. It was found that there were 303, 284 and 273 differentially expressed proteins in S. Enteritidis after 6\u202fh exposure to whole, 80% and 50% egg white, respectively. Most of up-regulated proteins were primarily associated with iron acquisition, cofactor and amino acid biosynthesis, transporter, regulation and stress responses, whereas down-regulated proteins were mainly involved in energy metabolism, virulence as well as motility and chemotaxis. Three stress response-related proteins (YbgC, TolQ, TolA) of the tol-pal system responsible for maintaining cell membrane stability of Gram-negative bacteria were up-regulated in S. Enteritidis in response to whole egg white. Interestingly, deletion of ybgC resulted in a decreased resistance of S. Enteritidis to egg white. Compared with the wild type and complementary strains, a 3-log population reduction was observed in \u25b3ybgC mutant strain after incubation in whole egg white for 24\u202fh. Cellular morphology of \u25b3ybgC mutant strain was altered from rods to spheres along with cell lysis in whole egg white. Furthermore, deletion of ybgC decreased the expression of tol-pal system-related genes (tolR, tolA). Collectively, these proteomic and mutagenic analysis reveal that YbgC is essential for S. Enteritidis survival in egg white.",

        "abstract": "Cross-protection to environmental stresses by ethanol adaptation in Salmonella poses a great threat to food safety because it can undermine food processing interventions. The ability of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) to develop acid resistance following ethanol adaptation (5% ethanol for 1\u00a0h) was evaluated in this study. Ethanol-adapted S. Enteritidis mounted cross-tolerance to malic acid (a two-fold increase in minimum bactericidal concentration), but not to acetic, ascorbic, lactic, citric and hydrochloric acids. The population of S. Enteritidis in orange juice (pH 3.77) over a 48-h period was not significantly (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05) influenced by ethanol adaptation. However, an increased survival by 0.09-1.02 log CFU/ml was noted with ethanol-adapted cells of S. Enteritidis compared to non-adapted cells in apple juice (pH 3.57) stored at 25\u00a0\u00b0C (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but not at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. RT-qPCR revealed upregulation of two acid tolerance-related genes, rpoS (encoding \u03c3) and SEN1564A (encoding an acid shock protein), following ethanol adaptation. The relative expression level of the acid resistance gene hdeB did not change. The resistance phenotypes and transcriptional profiles of S. Enteritidis suggest some involvement of rpoS and SEN1564A in the ethanol-induced acid tolerance mechanism.",

Farm products, including raw meat, vegetables, and dairy products, may be important vehicles for transmitting foodborne pathogens, thus representing a threat to human health. In this study, the prevalence of  Salmonella  isolated from farm products in Shanghai was investigated and characterized. A total of 344 samples were randomly collected from farmers\u2019 markets, supermarkets, milk factories, and a slaughterhouse in Shanghai between March 2016 and February 2017. Using the Chinese National Standard method (GB 4789.4\u20132010), 83 (24.1%) samples were determined to be positive for  Salmonella,  including 42 (42.4%) pork, 21 (41.2%) chicken, 15 (31.3%) beef, 3 (16.7%) mutton, 1 (4.5%) lettuce, and 1 (3.8%) cucumber. All egg and raw milk samples were negative for  Salmonella . Ninety strains were isolated from the positive samples, and 12 serovars were identified, including Enteritidis (n\u00a0=\u00a035), Typhimurium (n\u00a0=\u00a022), Derby (n\u00a0=\u00a013), Anatum (n\u00a0=\u00a05), Agona (n\u00a0=\u00a04), Thompson (n\u00a0=\u00a03), Indiana (n\u00a0=\u00a03), Braenderup (n\u00a0=\u00a01), Heidelberg (n\u00a0=\u00a01), Infantis (n\u00a0=\u00a01), Litchfield (n\u00a0=\u00a01) and Manhattan (n\u00a0=\u00a01). All isolates were characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and subtyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Thirteen sequence types (ST) were identified, among which ST11, ST34, and ST40 were the predominant STs. ST was highly correlated with serovar type. The results of PFGE showed that 73 PFGE patterns were generated from the isolates. In conclusion,  Salmonella  contamination was common among farm products in Shanghai, and the diversity of the pathogen was high among the isolates.",

        "abstract": "Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are the dominant cause of food-borne outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis. However, fundamental researches on HuNoVs, such as identification of viral receptors have been limited by the currently immature system to culture HuNoVs and the lack of efficient small animal models. Previously, we demonstrated that the recombinant protruding domain (P domain) of HuNoVs capsid proteins were successfully anchored on the surface of  BL21 cells after the bacteria were transformed with a plasmid expressing HuNoVs P protein fused with bacterial transmembrane anchor protein. The cell-surface-displayed P proteins could specifically recognize and bind to histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs, receptors of HuNoVs). In this study, an upgraded bacterial surface displayed system was developed as a new platform to discover candidate receptors of HuNoVs. A thrombin-susceptible \"linker\" sequence was added between the sequences of bacterial transmembrane anchor protein and P domain of HuNoV (GII.4) capsid protein in a plasmid that displays the functional P proteins on the surface of bacteria. In this new system, the surface-displayed HuNoV P proteins could be released by thrombin treatment. The released P proteins self-assembled into small particles, which were visualized by electron microscopy. The bacteria with the surface-displayed P proteins were incubated with pig stomach mucin which contained HBGAs. The bacteria-HuNoV P proteins-HBGAs complex could be collected by low speed centrifugation. The HuNoV P proteins-HBGAs complex was then separated from the recombinant bacterial surface by thrombin treatment. The released viral receptor was confirmed by using the monoclonal antibody against type A HBGA. It demonstrated that the new system was able to capture and easily isolate receptors of HuNoVs. This new strategy provides an alternative, easier approach for isolating unknown receptors/ligands of HuNoVs from different samples including mammalian cell lines, oysters, and fresh produce.",

        "abstract": "A multiplex real-time PCR (qPCR) assay was developed for simultaneous detection and differentiation of the three most important Campylobacter species in chickens. Three novel sets of PCR primers and TaqMan probes were designed to amplify the unique DNA sequences within the hipO, cdtA, and pepT genes which are specific to Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, and Campylobacter lari, respectively. To avoid competition in the multiple target amplifications, the concentrations of primers and probes were optimized. By using the optimized qPCR conditions together with a minor-groove binding probe of pepT, amplification efficiency greater than 92% and detection sensitivity of 38 genome copies/reaction have been achieved for all three targets. The assay was highly specific for C. jejuni, C. coli, and C. lari with testing of 33 Campylobacter strains and 20 non-Campylobacter strains. In chicken samples spiked with known quantities of Campylobacter cells, the assay was able to detect 1 CFU/g after a 24-h enrichment. Application of the assay in food was further evaluated using 21 fresh chicken samples obtained from local supermarkets. The results revealed that, after a 24-h or 48-h enrichment, 14 samples (66.7%) were positive for C. jejuni, five samples (23.8%) were positive for C. coli, and none of the samples was contaminated by C. lari. Taken together, the multiplex qPCR assay combined with an enrichment step is a sensitive, species-specific, and non-labor-intensive method suitable for rapid detection of C. jejuni, C. coli, and C. lari in chicken samples. \u00a9 2010 US Government.",

        "abstract": "A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was developed for simultaneous detection of the genes encoding methicillin resistance (mecA), SEs A, B and C (sea, seb and sec), coagulase (coa), and 16S rRNA. The primers for amplification of the 16S rRNA gene were specific for Staphylococcus spp., and the primers for coa were specific for Staphylococcus aureus. Based on the results, the multiplex PCR was accomplished at an optimal Mg 2 +concentration of 1.0 mM and at an annealing temperature of 56C. This multiplex PCR method was performed with 71 strains of S. aureus and 51 strains of six other bacterial species. Among the S. aureus strains tested, 40.0% (28/71) were found to contain the mecA gene. One of the 28 mecA +strains was not resistant to methicillin. The sea, seb and sec genes were present in 47.9% (34/71), 5.6% (4/71) and 8.5% (6/71) of S. aureus strains, respectively. The sensitivity of this multiplex PCR method was approximately 104.5 pg of genomic DNA per reaction, which was equivalent to an estimated 2.4 \u00d7 10 3 cfu of S. aureus or 3.64 \u00d7 10 4 copies of genome equivalent. \u00a9 2008, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Three chloroplast genes, chlL, chlN and chlB, encoding the light-independent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (LIPOR) in Chlorella protothecoides CS-41 growing either photoautotrophically, mixotrophically or heterotrophically, were all transcribed constitutively independent\n of illumination and presence of glucose. Steady-state amounts of all three transcripts in the light-grown cells were, however,\n approximately two- to three-fold greater than those in the dark-grown cells. In addition, Western blotting demonstrated that\n approximately the same amount of protein was present in cultures grown mixtrophically or heterotrophically both containing\n glucose. However, much less protein was in photoautotrophic cells. These results suggest that LIPOR activity depends on post-transcriptional\n and post-translational regulation. Moreover, the fact that LIPOR accumulates in the light-grown cells indicates that LIPOR,\n which was thought to work only in darkness, may partially account for the protochlorophyllide photoreduction in light. Therefore,\n LIPOR switches on both in light and in darkness.",

        "abstract": "Despite the improvement of PCR technology, false-negative results from PCR detection remain as an unresolved issue, which may reduce the detection accuracy. To address this problem, an internal amplification control, which is a non-target DNA fragment, is sometime suggested at present to be included into a PCR detection system to be co-amplified with the target sequence so as to indicate the PCR inhibitors in the samples and false negative results in the detection. This is also necessary for the standardization of PCR detection system. The purpose of this article was to provide a review on the IAC-PCR in three aspects: the causes of the false-negative results appearing, the construction strategies of internal amplification controls and the applications of IAC-PCR. In addition, a brief introduction of related research work on IAC-PCR in our laboratory will be mentioned in this review, which might be helpful to develop an easy method for the construction of IAC, which could indicate the false-negative results without the decrease of detection sensitivity.",

In recent years, foodborne outbreaks have significantly increased, which were resulted from V. parahaemolytieus associated with consumption of raw or undercooked shellfish, contaminated food. The clinical V. parahaemolytieus isolates (re=158), which came from Pudong, Jinshan, zhoushan and Ningbo in 2006-2009, were serotyped with 110 antibodies and 8 K antibodies. In addition, the virulence-related genes of all isolates were analyzed, including tdh (Thermostable direct hemolysin) and trh (Thermostable direct hemolysin-related haemolysin). The results showed that those isolates could be divided into 22 serotypes. V. parahaemolytieus O3:K6 isolates were the epidemic strains (107/158). Other serotypes of these isolates were O1:K6, O3:K68, O1:K25, O1:K56, O2:K3, and so on. V. parahaemolytieus isolates from Jinshan were the most diversity. On the other hand, those from Zhoushan were the most unitary. The analysis results of their virulence genes demonstrated that most strains contained tdh gene (153/158) and trh gene (6/158). Six out of 158 isolates were both (tdh+/trh+), 147 were (tdh+/trh-), and 5 were (tdh-/trh-). In conclusion, almost all clinical isolates contained the pathogenic genes.

PCR specificity was identified by amplification of 293 V. parahaemolyticus templates and by the loss of a PCR product with 11 strains from other Vibrio species and 35 non-Vibrio bacterial strains. The PCR assay had the 369-bp fragment and the sensitivity of 0.17 pg purified genomic DNA from V. parahaemolyticus. Furthermore, a multiplex PCR assay for the detection of total and virulent strains of V. parahaemolyticus was developed by targeting irgB, tdh and trh genes. These data indicated that the irgB gene is a new and effective marker for the detection of V. parahaemolyticus. In addition, this study demonstrates that genome sequence comparison has a powerful application in identifying specific markers for the detection and identification of bacterial pathogens.",

        "abstract": "A real time PCR assay for the detection of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in seafood samples was developed using a novel specific target and a competitive internal amplification control (IAC). The specificity of this assay was evaluated using 390 bacterial strains including V. parahaemolyticus, and other strains belonging to Vibrio and non-Vibrio species. The real time PCR assay unambiguously distinguished V. parahaemolyticus with a detection sensitivity of 4.8 fg per PCR with purified genomic DNA or 1 CFU per reaction by counting V. parahaemolyticus colonies. The assays of avoiding interference demonstrated that, even in the presence of 2.1 \u03bcg genomic DNA or 10(7) CFU background bacteria, V. parahaemolyticus could still be accurately detected. In addition, the IAC was used to indicate false-negative results, and lower than 94 copies of IAC per reaction had no influence on the detection limit. Ninety-six seafood samples were tested, of which 58 (60.4%) were positive, including 3 false negative results. Consequently, the real time PCR assay is effective for the rapid detection of V. parahaemotyticus contaminants in seafood.",

It was reported that bacteria could be bio-accumulated mainly in the gills and digestive glands. In artificially treated oysters, bacterial communities have been investigated by culture-independent methods after harvest. However, little information is available on the seasonal dynamics of bacterial accumulation in retail oyster tissues. In this study, retail oysters were collected from local market in different seasons. The seasonal dynamics and diversity of bacteria in oyster tissues, including the gills, digestive glands and residual tissues, were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). It was interesting that the highest bacterial diversity appeared in the Fall season, not in summer. Our results indicated that Proteobacteria was the predominant member (23/46) in oyster tissues. Our results also suggested that bacterial diversity in gills was higher than that in digestive glands and other tissues. In addition, not all the bacteria collected from surrounding water by gills were transferred to digestive glands. On the other hand, few bacteria were found in oyster tissues except in the gills. Therefore, the gills could be the best candidate target tissue for monitoring of pathogenic bacteria either to human or to oyster.",

        "abstract": "Vibrio parahaemolyticus is an important food-borne bacterium that is closely related to food poisoning from consumption of raw or lightly-cooked oysters. Therefore, intensive efforts must be taken to depurate the contaminated oysters. Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) is considered to be a safe and effective disinfectant and is routinely applied for treatment of drinking water and seafood. However, the retention of V. parahaemolyticus in oyster tissues has not yet been explored after using ClO2 as a disinfectant. To address this lack of information, oysters (Crassostrea gigas) were artificially contaminated with V. parahaemolyticus (ATCC 17802). Individual oysters, the gills and the digestive glands were analyzed by spreading supernatants from homogenized tissues onto thiosulfate-citrate-bile-salt sucrose agar and polymerase chain reaction assays on the resulting bacterial colonies. V. parahaemolyticus that bioaccumulated in different oyster tissues could be disinfected completely after 6h of treatment with 20mg/L of ClO2. Thus, ClO2 appears to be a candidate disinfectant for V. parahaemolyticus depuration in oysters. The digestive glands appear to be a promising target tissue for detection of bacterial pathogens in oysters, using either conventional methods or molecular assays. The shelf life of oysters was extended to at least 12days following 6h of ClO2 treatment at 4 degrees C.",

        "abstract": "A genome comparison method was used to identify specific target sequences for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and the CDS value of this bacterium was compared with that of 139 other bacterial genomes. It was found that 20 CDS of V. parahaemolyticus were relatively specific according to their E value in BLAST (a new tool for comparing protein and nucleotide sequences), and four of them were selected for the design of PCR primers. There were positive amplification products of these four pairs of primers from nine V. parahaemolyticus strains, whereas there were no amplification products from nine other Vibrionaceae strains and four non-Vibrionaceae strains. An evaluation of detection sensitivities revealed that these four pairs of primers can be used in a PCR assay for the detection of V. parahaemolyticus. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS An automatic BLAST method was developed in this study, by which species-specific sequences can be screened out rapidly. In this way, new and specific genes of Vibrio parahaemolyticus were identified to be used as target sequences for PCR detection. In terms of acceptable specificity and sensitivity, the four pairs of primers were selected by screening, which can be applied in PCR assays and other molecular methods. These kinds of methods might become commercial detection products in the new future. In addition, this method for searching specific DNA sequences can also be used for the mining specific sequences in other genus and species, such as Salmonella, Staphylococcus, etc. \u00a9 2009, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

After a 48-h depuration period at 17-19 degrees C, the retention rate of V. parahaemolyticus in the gills (28.1%) and digestive glands (13.5%) was higher than that in adductor muscle and mantle cilia (1.4 and 2.4%, respectively).The population of V. parahaemolyticus in the digestive glands was the highest among all tissues tested, followed by the gills. The data indicate that digestive glands and gills are good sample candidates for direct monitoring of V. parahaemolyticus contamination in oysters.This is the first report on the dynamics of V. parahaemolyticus in various oyster tissues following artificial contamination and depuration.

        "abstract": "The occurrence of outbreaks of Vibrio parahaemolyticus gastroenteritis in China highlights the need for strain characterization and subtyping of this pathogenic species. A total of 56 epidemiologically-unrelated strains of V. parahaemolyticus were isolated from clinical samples, seafood and various environmental sites in the middle-east coastline of China from 2006 to 2008. The isolates were characterized using four molecular typing methods, including ribotyping, enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence PCR (ERIC-PCR), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and sequence analysis of the gyrB gene. Genetic profiles of cluster analysis from these molecular typing tests clearly showed that there were differences in potential pathogenicity among isolates from seafood and its environments. Genetic characterization of two isolates (F13 and QS2) that originated from seafood demonstrated that they were potentially pathogenic. Discriminatory indices of four typing methods for the 56 V. parahaemolyticus isolates were differentiated by Simpson's Index of Diversity. The discriminatory index of ERIC-PCR typing was maximal (D=0.942), while that of sequence analysis of the gyrB gene was minimal (D=0.702). The discriminatory ability was greatly enhanced (D=0.966) when ERIC-PCR was coupled with sequence analysis of the gyrB gene. These results suggest that ERIC-PCR combined with sequence analysis of gyrB gene may be a reliable, rapid typing strategy for V. parahaemolyticus strains.",

        "abstract": "In this study, a single base extension-tag array on glass slides (SBE-TAGS) microarray was established to detect the seven\n leading seafood-borne pathogens, including Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus, Vibrio mimicus, Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio anguillarum, and Vibrio harveyi. Three multiplex PCR assays were developed to specifically target the following species with individual gene markers, which\n are aadS, tdh, and trh for V. parahaemolyticus; col, toxR, and vvh for V. alginolyticus, V. mimicus, and V. vulnificus; and empA, vhh1, and tcpA for V. anguillarum, V. harveyi, and V. cholerae, respectively. The purified PCR products were used as template DNA for single base extension-tag reactions, labeled with\n Cy3 fluorescent dye and hybridized to DNA microarrays. The detection specificity of this microarray method was 100%, with\n the sensitivity for pure genomic DNA at 200\u00a0fg to 2\u00a0pg per reaction. Application of the DNA microarray methodology to 55 naturally\n contaminated seafood samples (shrimp, fish, and oysters) revealed the presence of V. parahaemolyticus at 50.9% and V. alginolyticus at 32.7%. This corresponds with traditional assays (microbiological and biochemical tests) except one sample which was identified\n as negative in V. parahaemolyticus by the microarray assay but as positive by the conventional method. Therefore, a combination of multiplex PCR with DNA microarray\n hybridization based on SBE-TAGS ensures rapid and accurate detection of pathogenic Vibrio species in seafood, thereby providing safer seafood products for consumers at a low financial burden to the aquaculture industry.",

        "abstract": "A total of 152 Salmonella isolates recovered from retail foods in Henan Province in China were characterized using serotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Nalidixic acid and/or ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates were further examined for amino acid substitution of gyrase and topoisomerase 4, and for the presence of qnr (qnrA, qnrB and qnrS) and aac(6')-Ib genes. Selected serovars were subtyped using pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Among all isolates tested, Salmonella Enteritidis (34.2%) was the most common serotype detected, followed by S. Indiana (9.9%), S. Derby (9.9%), S. Agona (6.6%), S. Typhimurium (5.3%) and S. Albany (4.6%). Twenty-eight percent of the isolates were resistant to 1-3 antimicrobials, 37% to 4-6 antimicrobials, 23% to 7-9 antimicrobials, and 12% to more than 10 antimicrobials. Resistance was most frequently detected to sulfamethoxazole (95.3%), followed by trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (80.5%), tetracycline (75.8%), nalidixic acid (75.8%), ampicillin (45.6%), chloramphenicol (35.6%), streptomycin (32.9%), kanamycin (24.8%), gentamicin (21.5%) and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (14.8%). Resistance was also observed to ciprofloxacin (12.1%), cefoperazone (18.8%), ceftriaxone (6.0%) and cefoxitin (4.0%). A total of 45 amino acid substitutions were identified in quinolone resistant determination region (QRDR) of gyrA and parC of 19 ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates. The most common mutations in gyrA were Ser83Phe and Asp87Gly, in parC was Ser80Arg. QnrA, qnrB, qnrS and aac(6')-Ib genes were identified in 55 (46.6%), 15 (12.7%), 23 (19.5%) and 16 (13.6%) of 118 nalidixic acid resistant but ciprofloxacin susceptible or less resistant isolates, respectively. A total of 108 PFGE patterns were generated among 146 selected isolates. Our findings indicate that foodborne Salmonella isolates in Henan, China were phenotypically and genotypically diverse and many isolates demonstrated multidrug resistance. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

This study investigated the prevalence of ESBL-producing Salmonella in 699 Salmonella isolates recovered from 1,152 retail chickens collected from six provinces and two national cities in the People's Republic of China in 2011. ESBL-producing isolates were screened by double-disk synergy test and confirmed using PCR and DNA sequencing. Of the 699 isolates tested, 60 (8.58%) were identified to be ESBL-producing Salmonella. Prevalence of ESBL-producing Salmonella was the highest in Shanghai city (17 [24.64%] of 69), followed by Shaanxi (10 [15.38%] of 65), Fujian (9 [11.69%] of 77), Guangdong (9 [7.69%] of 117), Sichuan (5 [7.25%] of 69), Beijing (6 [5.17%] of 116), Henan (4 [4.65%] of 86), and Guangxi (0 [0%] of 100) province. Significant difference (P < 0.05) in the prevalence of ESBL-producing Salmonella was found among six provinces and two cities. No significant difference (P > 0.05) in the prevalence was found between wet markets and supermarkets or between whole chickens and chopped chickens. The prevalence of ESBL-producing Salmonella differed significantly (P < 0.05) among different seasons, being higher in autumn than in spring and winter. Overall, ESBL-producing Salmonella varied significantly (P < 0.05) among 12 detected Salmonella serotypes: Abony (1 [33.33%] of 3), Indiana (28 [28.57%] of 98), Edinburg (6 [24.00%] of 25), Shubra (2 [20.00%] of 10), Uppsala (1 [16.67%] of 6), Thompson (8 [14.81%] of 54), Haardt (1 [12.50%] of 8), Agona (3 [9.68%] of 31), Gueuletapee (1 [6.25%] of 16), Typhimurium (4 [5.56%] of 72), Heidelberg (1 [4.55%] of 22), and Enteritidis (4 [3.17%] of 126).

        "abstract": "Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing Salmonella enterica have been reported worldwide. However, research on foodborne ESBL-producing Salmonella has been rarely conducted. One hundred and thirty eight ceftriaxone or/and cefoperazone-resistant Salmonella strains recovered from retail foods in Shaanxi and Henan Province, China, were screened for ESBL. The ESBL-producing strains were further characterized for antimicrobial resistance, pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles, and the presence of blaTEM, blaSHV, blaOXA, blaCTX-M, and blaPSE. The transferability of ESBL encoding genes to a susceptible Escherichia coli strain was also investigated. Thirty (21.7%) isolates were identified as ESBL positive and belonged to S. enterica serovars Indiana, Shubra, Typhimurium, and Enteritidis. S. Indiana and S. Shubra isolates were firstly identified in ESBL-producing strains. Great genetic diversity was seen among these ESBL-producing strains. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that blaTEM-1B was the only ESBL-encoding gene among the genes tested and was detected in 26 of 30 strains and was carried in the conjugative plasmids. The blaTEM-1B gene was transferable through conjugation at rates ranging from 4.71 \u00d7 10(-7) to 7.55 \u00d7 10(-6) transconjugant per recipient cell. This study provides the evidence of foodborne ESBL-producing Salmonella, and the transferability of plasmid harboring ESBL-encoding genes could possibly contribute to the dissemination of ESBL.",

Then we established IAC-PCR and EvaGreen real-time IAC-PCR assays, which showed 100% inclusivity and 100% exclusivity on all strains tested. Their detection limits of purified Salmonella genomic DNA were 14.9 copies/PCR and 2.76 copies/PCR respectively. Artificial contamination assays showed that Salmonella could be detected after 10 hours and 8 hours enrichment when the original bacterial concentration was 4.2 cfu/10 mL.A new EvaGreen real-time IAC-PCR with high specificity and sensitivity was successfully developed for the rapid detection of Salmonella.",

Twenty-five samples tested positive for Salmonella from a total of 550 samples, of which 500 were obtained from feces of healthy chickens and 50 were obtained from diseased chicks. The 25 presumptive Salmonella isolates were confirmed by the API 20E identification kit. Serotyping of these isolates by agglutination tests with antiserum displayed seven serovars; genotyping of these isolates with multilocus sequence typing demonstrated six sequence type (ST) patterns (i.e., ST-11, ST-19, ST-92, ST-96, ST-290, and ST-367). The multilocus sequence typing data revealed that some of these strains, isolated from different farms, might have the same ST and might come from the same source. The susceptibilities of these strains to 14 antimicrobials were determined; most of the isolates (13 of 25) were resistant to doxycycline and tetracycline, and two isolates were resistant to cefotaxime and ceftazidime, but none was resistant to gentamicin or kanamycin.",

The influence of cell characteristics of Salmonella Typhimurium strains, such as growth phase, cell density, and the availability of nutrients and metabolites was evaluated regarding a 3 Log 10 reduction of surviving cells when exposed to a mild heat treatment of 55 \u00b0C. Using nonselective and selective agars it was revealed that under thermal stress Salmonella Typhimurium suffered from injuries on both outer and cytoplasmic membrane, which consequently led to cell death. Compared to stationary cells, those in exponential growth phase were more prone to thermal injury, especially on the cytoplasmic membrane. Occurrence of thermal inactivation and injury decreased with the increase of cell density, and with the increased availability of metabolites produced during cell growth, but showed no apparent correlation with nutrients in the culture broth. The results enlighten the importance of cell growth phase, cell density and metabolite availability in Salmonella Typhimurium thermal resistance. Consequently these factors should be well considered when models are constructed and used to predict thermal effects on the survival of the pathogen. Moreover, our data show that attention should be paid when selective media are used to detect sublethally injured cells. \u00a9 2012 Bundesamt f\u00fcr Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit (BVL).",

Therefore, monitoring and control on the food safety of shellfish is a significant public health concern worldwide. In recent years, our group has studied the pathogens in molecular detection, bioaccumulation and control in shellfish. Based on the our previous studies, the purpose of this article was to provide a review on the pathogens in shellfish in four aspects: the detection methods, distribution, depuration and epidemiology. The molecular methods were widely used in detection of pathogens in shellfish. In addition, the pathogens were bio-accumulated in the gills and digestive glands, including stomach and digestive diverticula, which are good candidate sites for detection of pathogens.",

        "abstract": "Chlorella is a promising alternative resource of lutein (xanthophyll) production as it can be cultivated heterotrophically in fermentors. In this paper, a kinetic model for lutein production by heterotrophic Chlorella pyrenoidosa was developed based on batch cultivations in 250-ml flasks and a 19-l fermentor. The model was validated by experimental data from two fed-batch cultivations performed in the same fermentor. The dynamic behavior of lutein production by C. pyrenoidosa with various concentrations of glucose and nitrogen was analyzed based on the kinetic model. Model-based analyses suggested that glucose concentrations between 5 and 24 g/l and nitrogen concentrations between 0.7 and 12 g/l during the cultivation were favorable for lutein production by heterotrophic C. pyrenoidosa. It also showed that fed-batch cultivations are more suitable for efficient production of lutein than batch ones. The results obtained in this study may contribute to commercial lutein production by heterotrophic Chlorella. \u00a9 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

It was found that the fluid viscosity was rather low and remained almost unchanged during the cultivation, implying that no (or very few) viscous substances were excreted into the medium. Investigation of the condensed suspension of C. pyrenoidosa showed that for biomass concentration under 150 g.L -1, the suspension of C. pyrenoidosa exhibited Newtonian behavior, and the fluid viscosity was rather low (about 40 mPa\u00b7s) and increased very slowly with the increase in cell concentration. With further increase in biomass concentration however, the fluid rheological behavior changed to non-Newtonian, and the fluid viscosity increased rapidly with the increase in cell concentration. From the viewpoint of rheology, C. pyrenoidosa is an excellent organism for high-cell-density culture, and there will be no rheological problems at cell densities under 150 g.L -1. \u00a9 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

A second functional thermostable nuclease (here termed as Nuc2) in S. aureus was characterized after recombinant expression in Escherichia coli. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis revealed that Nuc2 was a more conserved protein in the staphylococci group compared with Nuc1. Recombinant Nuc2 showed nuclease activity in the zymogram test and was able to degrade various types of nucleic acids. The optimal reaction temperature and pH for Nuc2 were 50 \u00b0C and pH 10, respectively. The enzymatic activity of Nuc2 was stimulated in the presence of Ca(2+) (0.05 mM), Mg(2+) (0.5mM), dithiothreitol, \u03b2-mecaptoethanol, TritonX-100, Tween-20, and urea; however, activity decreased sharply when exposed to heavy metals such as Zn(2+) and Mn(2+), and in the presence of EDTA or SDS. Nuc2 showed weaker activity, lower thermostability and different sensitivity to these chemical agents compared with Nuc1, which was consistent with differences in the sequence pattern and structure predicted. Furthermore, a nuc1 and nuc2 double deletion mutant of S. aureus and respective complementation experiments suggest a major role for nuc1 in terms of thermonuclease activity in S. aureus.",

Rapid detection of this pathogen is crucial in food industries and clinical laboratories to control S.aureus food poisoning and human infections. In this study, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy equipped with a germanium attenuated total reflection accessory was used as a novel approach to identify S.aureus. A total of 17 reference strains belonging to 4 different species and 84 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus spp. were analyzed. After the cultivation of the strains, spectral collection and data preprocessing, the S.aureus isolates were identified by a two-step discrimination procedure. An internal validation and the related external validation were performed to demonstrate the discriminatory power and the quality of the discrimination models before the discrimination analysis. In the first step, 38 S.aureus isolates were correctly classified and the others were misidentified as Staphylococcus haemolyticus by hierarchical clustering analysis model using the first derivatives from the spectral range between 1,800 and 1,050/cm. In the second step, several classification/discrimination algorithms of soft-independent modeling of class analogy, principal component regression and partial least squares regression (PLSR) were applied to build models for differentiating S.aureus and S.haemolyticus. The results showed that 57 (98.3%) strains and 4 (100%) strains of S.aureus and S.haemolyticus could be correctly identified by PLSR. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "A total of 108 S. aureus isolates from 16 major hospitals located in 14 different provinces in China were characterized for the profiles of 18 staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) genes, 3 exfoliatin genes (eta, etb and etd), and the toxic shock syndrome toxin gene (tsst) by PCR. The genomic diversity of each isolate was also evaluated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and accessory gene regulator (agr) typing. Of these strains, 90.7% (98/108) harbored toxin genes, in which tsst was the most prevalent toxin gene (48.1%), followed by sea (44.4%), sek (42.6%) and seq (40.7%). The see and etb genes were not found in any of the isolates tested. Because of high-frequency transfer of toxin gene-containing mobile genetic elements between S. aureus strains, a total of 47 different toxin gene combinations were detected, including a complete egc cluster in 19 isolates, co-occurrence of sea, sek and seq in 38 strains, and sec and sel together in 11 strains. Genetic typing by PFGE grouped all the strains into 25 clusters based on 80% similarity. MLST revealed 25 sequence types (ST) which were assigned into 16 clonal complexes (CCs) including 2 new singletons. Among these, 11 new and 6 known STs were first reported in the S. aureus strains from China. Overall, the genotyping results showed high genetic diversity of the strains regardless of their geographical distributions, and no strong correlation between genetic background and toxin genotypes of the strains. For genotyping S. aureus, PFGE appears to be more discriminatory than MLST. However, toxin gene typing combined with PFGE or MLST could increase the discriminatory power of genotyping S. aureus strains.",

        "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a common bacterial pathogen that has emerged as an increasingly important health concern. Following the recent publication of the genome sequences of 9 S. aureus strains (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi), a gene of S. aureus that relates signal transduction as a target for rapid detection and identification of the pathogen has been investigated. By sequence analysis of S. aureus signal transduction genes from the complete genome of S. aureus ATCC N315 and their comparison with other DNA sequences using GenBank BLAST searches, we identified a unique gene, vicK. Polymerase chain reaction primers (vicK1 and vicK2) derived from this gene allowed amplification of a 289-bp DNA fragment only from S. aureus and not from other Staphylococcus species and other common bacteria tested. Besides offering an additional target for specific confirmation of S. aureus, further analysis of the signal transduction gene vicK and its related protein product may lead to new insights into the molecular mechanisms of S. aureus maintenance and pathogenicity.",

Previous studies have revealed the existence of two functional thermostable nucleases encoded by two different genes (nuc1 and nuc2) in S. aureus. To identify the expression characteristics of these two genes, comparative mRNA analysis of nuc1 and nuc2 was carried out by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Distinct expression patterns were observed at different growth stages, and expression was under the control of the sae regulatory system in strain RN4220. The maximum level of nuc1 transcripts was at the post-exponential growth phase, and expression was notably down-regulated in a sae mutant. In contrast, nuc2 transcript levels declined after the early exponential phase, and they were slightly up-regulated in the sae mutant. Furthermore, unlike the expression of nuc1, which varied in three different S. aureus clinical strains, the transcription of nuc2 remained relatively constant. The nuc1 transcription level correlated well with thermonuclease activity results, which suggests that nuc1 plays a primary role in thermonuclease activity in S. aureus. This information will be useful for understanding thermonuclease gene function and alterations of regulation for pathogenesis and diagnosis of S. aureus.",

        "abstract": "The wide usage of antibiotics contributes to the increase in the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella. Plasmids play a critical role in horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance markers in Salmonella. This study aimed to screen and characterize plasmid profiles responsible for antibiotic resistance in Salmonella and ultimately to clarify the molecular mechanism of transferable plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance. A total of 226 Salmonella isolates were examined for antimicrobial susceptibility by a disk diffusion method. Thirty-two isolates (14.2%) were resistant to at least one antibiotic. The presence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes and \u03b2-lactamase genes were established by PCR amplification. PCR-based replicon typing (PBRT) revealed that these 32 isolates represented seven plasmid incompatibility groups (IncP, HI2, A/C, FIIs, FIA, FIB, and I1), and the IncHI2 (59.4%) was predominant. Antibiotic resistance markers located on plasmids were identified through plasmid curing. Fifteen phenotypic variants were obtained with the curing efficiency of 46.9% (15/32). The cured plasmids mainly belong to the HI2 incompatibility group. The elimination of IncHI2 plasmids correlated with the loss of \u03b2-lactamase genes (blaOXA-1 and blaTEM-1) and PMQR genes (qnrA and aac(6\u2019)-Ib-cr). Both IncHI2 and IncI1 plasmids in a S. enterica serovar Indiana isolate SJTUF 10584 were lost by curing. The blaCMY-2-carrying plasmid pS10584 from SJTUF 10584 was fully sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed that it possessed a plasmid scaffold typical for IncI1 plasmids with the unique genetic arrangement of IS1294-\u25b3ISEcp1-blaCMY-2-blc-sugE-\u25b3ecnR inserted into the colicin gene cia. These data suggested that IncHI2 was the major plasmid lineage contributing to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in Salmonella and the activity of multiple mobile genetic elements may contribute to antibiotic resistance evolution and dissemination between different plasmid replicons.",

An IAC was constructed by the compound primer technology. PCR parameters were optimized, and its reaction system was developed.A V. parahaemolyticus species-specific sequence (vp1332) which encodes probable binding protein component of ABC transporter was mined and selected as a detection target. A pair of specific primers (vp1332L/vp1332R) was designed based on this sequence for the development of a PCR assay. An internal amplification control was constructed and added into the PCR detection system, which was co-amplified with the target sequence so as to indicate the existence of inhibitors. Specificity of this PCR system was tested with 296 V. parahaemolyticus strains and 33 non-V. parahaemolyticus strains, and the results showed that there was a 343-bp amplicon resulted from all V. parahaemolyticus strains, while there was no this amplicon but only a 499-bp IAC amplicon appeared for all non- V. parahaemolyticus strains. The detection limit of this assay for purified V. parahaemolyticus genomic DNA was 1.6 x 10(2) cfu/mL. Artificial contamination assays showed that V. parahaemolyticus could be detected after eight hours enrichment when the original concentration of this bacterium was 1.24 cfu/25 g. The PCR method developed in this study was also evaluated with Seafood samples, and the results demonstrated that it worked effectively.A novel PCR method was successfully developed in this study, which could effectively detect V. parahaemolyticus with high accuracy and could especially eliminate false-negative results.",

Three multiple antibiotic-resistant Salmonella isolates and the control strain ATCC 13076 were subjected to induction experiments by stepwise increases in sub-lethal concentrations of ceftriaxone. Sub-lethal levels of ceftriaxone induced antibiotic-resistance but not control Salmonella isolates to ceftriaxone and to other antibiotics. After 100 generations in two months when the antibiotic stress was removed, only one isolate (S. Typhimurium 11202) maintained the induction changes in antibiotic resistance phenotype (tetracycline from resistance to sensitive and ampicillin from sensitive to resistance). Consistent with its stable phenotypic resistance changes, expression of the tetracycline and \u03b2-lactam resistance-related genes tetA and blaTEM were >10-fold down- and up-regulated, respectively. Moreover, this strain had increased mRNA levels of efflux pump associated genes acrB and tolC and the SOS response regulator lexA and down regulation of the porin gene ompC. We found no overt changes in plasmid profiles before and after resistance induction. In all, sub-lethal concentrations of ceftriaxone induced alterations in Salmonella isolates to multiple antibiotics and some of them kept stable maintenance. The increased blaTEM expression may pose a potential danger for new generation \u03b2-lactams antibiotics.",

Functionalization of magnetic nanoparticles is a key factor for efficient capture of the target analytes. In this paper, we report the synthesis of amino-rich silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles using a one-pot method. This type of magnetic nanoparticle has a rough surface and a higher density of amino groups than the nanoparticles prepared by a post-modification method. Furthermore, the results of hydrochloric acid treatment indicated that the magnetic nanoparticles were stably coated. The developed amino-rich silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles were used to directly adsorb DNA. After magnetic separation and blocking, the magnetic nanoparticles and DNA complexes were used directly for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), without onerous and time-consuming purification and elution steps. The results of real-time quantitative PCR showed that the nanoparticles with higher amino group density resulted in improved DNA capture efficiency. The results suggest that amino-rich silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles are of great potential for efficient bio-separation of DNA prior to detection by PCR. ",

Isolates belonged to three  L.\u00a0monocytogenes  serogroups, 1/2c, 3c (n\u00a0=\u00a047, 39.1%) was the most prevalent, followed by 1/2a, 3a (n\u00a0=\u00a044, 36.7%) and 1/2b, 3b, 7 (n\u00a0=\u00a029, 24.2%). Although the isolates were all susceptible to most antibiotics tested, 13 isolates were resistant to ceftriaxone and seven to tetracycline. None of the isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics. The  tet  (M) genes were detected among tetracycline-resistant isolates. The isolates all harbored virulence genes  hly ,  prfA ,  plcA ,  plcB ,  inlA ,  inlB ,  inlI ; 116 isolates (96.7%) were positive for  inlC ; 78 (65.0%) for  inlG ; 119 (99.2%) for  inlJ ; 8 (6.67%) for  llsX . A total of 74 distinct patterns were generated for the 119 isolates tested using  Apa I and  Asc I with Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). Three clinical isolates shared the same PFGE patterns with retail meet (chicken, duck, and beef) isolates. These findings indicated that food of animal origin likely serve as a major vehicle in transmitting human listeriosis in Shanghai. Active surveillance for  L.\u00a0monocytogenes  is needed for better understanding the epidemiology of the pathogen, and for effective control and prevention of human listeriosis.",

Recently, S. argenteus and S. schweitzeri were recognized as novel species closely related to S. aureus. In this study of these three species, it was found that two putative SE genes were located upstream of some vSa\u03b2 pathogenicity islands and the deduced amino acid sequences showed <\u202f65.3% identity with those of known SEs. The related proteins, designated staphylococcal enterotoxin-like toxin 26 (SEl26) and 27 (SEl27), were identified and characterized among the three species. The mRNAs encoding SEl26 and SEl27 were expressed during all the growth phases. Recombinant SEl26 and SEl27 exhibited superantigenic activity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and mouse splenocytes by examining cell proliferation and cytokine production. Interestingly, these two genes were present universally in S. argenteus sequence type 2250 with clinical importance. Meanwhile, SEl27 variants from different species showed differential sensitivity to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which corresponded to the primary bacterial species hosts. It was demonstrated from these results that SEl26 and SEl27 were characterized to be two novel SE toxins and some SEs evolved along with the bacteria when the organisms adapted the hosts' immune systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract    Listeria monocytogenes  is a major foodborne pathogen that is well known for its high mortality rate in humans upon infection. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and serotype diversity of  L.\u00a0monocytogenes  isolates in various foods. From July 2013 to June 2014, a total of 648 food samples, originating from raw milk, quick-frozen food, vegetables, raw meats, cooked meats, aquatic products, dairy products and bean products, were collected from open-air markets, large supermarkets, delis and dairy farms, in Shanghai, China. Forty samples (6.2%) tested positive for  L.\u00a0monocytogenes , confirmed by both bacteriological and molecular methods. Among the food categories surveyed, the highest prevalence was observed in raw meat samples at 16.0% (15/94), followed by 9.9% (10/101) in quick-frozen food samples and 7.3% (4/55) in cooked meat samples. Serotyping showed that majority of the isolates (67.5%) belonged to serotype 1/2a, followed by 1/2b (22.5%), 1/2c (7.5%) and 3c (2.5%). Isolates were assessed for their ability to form biofilms. Significant differences in biofilm forming abilities were observed between storage temperatures and serotypes. Anti-biofilm efficacy of industrial disinfectants, chlorine dioxide (ClO 2 ) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), was examined by measuring minimal effective concentration (MEC) on  L.\u00a0monocytogenes  in biofilm. A positive correlation was observed among the biofilm\u2019s resistance to H 2 O 2  and the biomass of biofilms. ClO 2  was found to be more effective against biofilm and inactivated all the listerial cells in the biofilm state, whereas H 2 O 2  was not able to kill all the cells in biofilms at the recommended concentrations according to National Food Safety Standard of China. Our study suggests that there is potential public health risk of  L.\u00a0monocytogenes  infection in Shanghai. Efficacy against  L.\u00a0monocytogenes  biofilm should be considered when evaluating disinfectants.",

We innovatively put the complexes of magnetic capture probes and target sequences into qPCR without any need for denaturation and purification steps. This strategy can reduce manual steps and save time. We used the magnetic capture probes to separate  mRNA from  in artificially contaminated milk samples. The detection sensitivity was 10\u00a0CFU/ml, which could be increased to 10\u00a0CFU/ml after a 12\u00a0h enrichment step.

Plasmids play a critical role in horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance markers in . This study aimed to screen and characterize plasmid profiles responsible for antibiotic resistance in  and ultimately to clarify the molecular mechanism of transferable plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance. A total of 226  isolates were examined for antimicrobial susceptibility by a disk diffusion method. Thirty-two isolates (14.2%) were resistant to at least one antibiotic. The presence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes and -lactamase genes were established by PCR amplification. PCR-based replicon typing revealed that these 32 isolates represented seven plasmid incompatibility groups (IncP, HI2, A/C, FIIs, FIA, FIB, and I1), and the IncHI2 (59.4%) was predominant. Antibiotic resistance markers located on plasmids were identified through plasmid curing. Fifteen phenotypic variants were obtained with the curing efficiency of 46.9% (15/32). The cured plasmids mainly belong to the HI2 incompatibility group. The elimination of IncHI2 plasmids correlated with the loss of -lactamase genes ( and ) and PMQR genes ( and ). Both IncHI2 and IncI1 plasmids in a  serovar Indiana isolate SJTUF 10584 were lost by curing. The -carrying plasmid pS10584 from SJTUF 10584 was fully sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed that it possessed a plasmid scaffold typical for IncI1 plasmids with the unique genetic arrangement of IS-\u0394IS----\u0394 inserted into the colicin gene . These data suggested that IncHI2 was the major plasmid lineage contributing to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in  and the activity of multiple mobile genetic elements may contribute to antibiotic resistance evolution and dissemination between different plasmid replicons.",

        "abstract": "To achieve an effective detection of Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli O157, and Listeria monocytogenes in meat products, a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled with a multipathogen enrichment strategy was developed in this study. Pathogen-specific DNA sequences in the invA, rfbE, and hlyA genes were employed to design primers and TaqMan probes for identifying Salmonella spp., E. coli O157, and L. monocytogenes, respectively. An internal amplification control (IAC) utilizing a novel DNA sequence from human adenovirus was incorporated into the multiplex PCR assay to indicate false-negative results. Concurrent amplifications of multiple targets and IAC were thoroughly evaluated and optimized to minimize PCR competitions. Combined with a multipathogen enrichment in a selective enrichment broth for Salmonella, Escherichia, and Listeria (SEL), the multiplex real-time PCR assay was able to simultaneously detect all of the three organisms in artificially contaminated ground beef at a detection sensitivity of <18 CFU/10 g ground beef. Applying the assay to 26 retail meat samples including beef, chicken, turkey, and pork revealed that 12 samples were positive for one of the organisms and 3 samples were positive for two of the organisms after a 20-h enrichment in SEL. The remaining meat samples tested negative for all of the organisms by only showing amplification of the IAC. These results were confirmed by traditional culture methods testing for each individual species. Taken together, the multiplex real-time PCR assay combined with multipathogen enrichment is a rapid and reliable method for effectively screening single or multiple pathogen occurrences in various meat products.",

The homologous recombination vector pBT2\u0394sae was constructed and the sae deletion mutant strain was successfully obtained. The results showed that the sae locus played an important role in the production of thermonucleases and other exoproteins. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed different exoprotein profiles between parent strain and mutant strain, in which three bands were visibly weakened. The results revealed that sae locus was involved in the regulation on exoproteins, some of which play a known fundamental role in the virulence of S. aureus. \u00a9 2010, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

However, two ORFs in S. aureus genomes were predicted to encode nucleases. One encoded an unnamed nuclease A (SNase) (termed nuc1), and the other encoded a thermonuclease (TNase) named nuc (termed nuc2). In order to verify whether the two thermostable nuclease proteins are coexpressed in S. aureus, the nuc1 and nuc2 genes were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and both of the recombinant proteins showed thermostable nuclease activity in a toluidine blue-DNA assay. Furthermore, a nuc1-deleted mutant of S. aureus strain RN4220 (termed RNDeltanuc1) was successfully constructed by homologous recombination. Selection and characterization of this mutant strain revealed that it still exhibited thermostable nuclease activity, but at a relative lower level than that of the parent strain. The nucleases secreted by the parent strain and nuc1-deleted strain still showed functional activity after 30 min at 121 degrees C. The findings indicated that two types of thermostable nucleases, encoded by two different genes, coexisted in S. aureus.",

After optimizing parameters such as pH, temperature, and time, a trace amount of genomic DNA of pathogens could be extracted directly from complex matrices such as raw milk using ASMNPs. The magnetically separated complexes of genomic DNA and ASMNPs were directly subjected to single PCR (S-PCR) or multiplex PCR (M-PCR) to detect single or multiple pathogens from raw milk samples. Salmonella Enteritidis (Gram-negative) and Listeria monocytogenes (Gram-positive) were used as model organisms to artificially contaminate raw milk samples. After magnetic separation and S-PCR, the detection sensitivities were 8 CFU mL(-1) and 13 CFU mL(-1) respectively for these two types of pathogens. Furthermore, this method was successfully used to detect multiple pathogens (S. Enteritidis and L. monocytogenes) from artificially contaminated raw milk using M-PCR at sensitivities of 15 CFU mL(-1) and 25 CFU mL(-1), respectively. This method has great potential to rapidly and sensitively detect pathogens in raw milk or other complex food matrices.",

To examine the mechanism of biofilm formation, L. monocytogenes transposon mutant strain GB8 with decreased ability to form biofilm was characterized in this study. Southern blot assay revealed a single copy of transposon in the GB8 chromosome, and the insertion site was identified by inverse polymerase chain reaction (IPCR). The expression of lm.G_1497 was found to be inactivated by the transposon insertion, and the gene was identical to gene LMOf2365_1497 in the sequenced strain L. monocytogenes strain 4b F2365, encoding a MerR family protein. The ability of producing biofilm was recovered in revertant GBR8. It was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR that the transcription of the gene flanking lm.G_1497 was not affected by Tn917 insertion. These results suggested that lm.G_1497 was responsible for the positive regulation of biofilm formation in L. monocytogenes 4b G. Moreover, the failure of lm.G_1497 expression resulted in a decrease of the autolysis rate, while no effect on cell growth and motility in L. monocytogenes GB8, which might imply that the reduction in biofilm was caused by the difference in cell autolysis.",

        "abstract": "Little is known about the molecular basis of biofilm formation in Listeria monocytogenes. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) of the deletion mutant of lm.G_1771 gene, which encodes for a putative ABC transporter permease, is highly expressed in biofilm. In this study, the sod gene deletion mutant \u0394sod, and double deletion mutant of the sod and lm. G_1771 genes \u03941771\u0394sod were used to investigate the role of SOD and its relationship to the expression of the putative ABC transporter permease in biofilm formation. Our results showed that the ability to form a biofilm was significantly reduced in the \u0394sod mutant and the \u03941771\u0394sod double mutant. Both \u0394sod and \u03941771\u0394sod mutants exhibited slow growth phenotypes and produced more reactive oxygen species (ROS). The growth was inhibited in the mutants by methyl viologen (MV, internal oxygen radical generator) treatment. In addition, the expression of one oxidation resistance gene (kat), two stress regulators encoding genes (perR and sigB), and one DNA repair gene (recA) were analyzed in both the wild-type L. monocytogenes 4b G and the deletion mutants by RT-qPCR. The expression levels of the four genes were increased in the deletion mutants when biofilms were formed. Taken together, our data indicated that SOD played an important role in biofilm formation through coping with the oxidant burden in deficient antioxidant defenses.",

        "abstract": "The foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is able to form biofilms in food processing environments. Previously, we have reported that an lm.G_1771 gene (encoding a putative ABC-transporter permease) was involved in negative regulation of L. monocytogenes biofilm formation using LM-49, a biofilm-enhanced mutant isolated on Tn917 mutagenesis (AEM 2008 p.7675-7683). Here, the possible action of this ABC-transporter permease in L. monocytogenes biofilm formation was characterized by phenotypic, proteomic, and genomic analyses using an lm.G_1771 gene deletant (\u03941771). The \u03941771 mutant exhibited the same enhanced ability for biofilm formation as the LM-49 strain using a crystal violet staining assay. DNA microarrays and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed 49 and 11 differentially expressed (twofold or more) genes or proteins in \u03941771, respectively. The transcriptomics study indicated that lm.G_1771 could play a vital role in regulating candidate genes involved in biofilm formation such as genes encoding cell surface proteins (Dlt), cell surface anchor proteins (SrtA), and transcriptional regulators (GntR) contributing to negative regulation of biofilm formation by L. monocytogenes. The mutant \u03941771 was more sensitive to Triton X-100 and less resistant to cationic antibiotics, which might be explained by the down-regulation of dlt operon in this deletant and the fact that dlt involves the incorporation of D-alanine residues into lipoteichoic acids, resulting in a positive net charge on the teichoic acids. Therefore, lm.G_1771 is considered to be involved in negative regulation of biofilm formation, and the results from this work provide a possible molecular mechanism of biofilm formation regulated by lm.G_1771 in L. monocytogenes.",

In this Q-PCR assay, a computational DNA random shuffling method was used to design an internal amplification control (IAC) sequence, which was the same in length and G + C content to the hly amplicon. This IAC sequence was inserted into the genome of L. monocytogenes to create a mutant strain named L. monocytogenes-IAC. The LM-IAC was used as an internal control during the PCR assay and produced accurate quantification of L. monocytogenes due to similar DNA extraction and amplification efficiencies between LM-IAC strain and wild-type L. monocytogenes. Quantification by this method was over a 5-log linearity range of initial L. monocytogenes with an R(2) value of 0.9997. This PCR method will provide accurate quantification of L. monocytogenes and can be used in the clinic and food assays for diagnostic purposes.",

        "abstract": "The foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes has the capability to persist on surfaces in food-processing environments, and the organism is resistant to environmental stresses. In this study, a Tn917 insertion mutant of L. monocytogenes 4b G showing reduced biofilm formation and sensitivity to oxidative stress was identified and characterized. The transposon insertion site within the gltB gene was identified by inverse PCR. The gltC gene is located upstream and is reported to be transcribed divergently from gltB. Mutants with deletions in gltB and gltC were constructed and both showed reduced biofilm formation and increased sensitivity to H2O2 compared to the wild-type. In the wild-type strain, gltB and gltC expressions were induced approximately 8-fold and 14-fold by quantitative RT-PCR, respectively, with exposure to H2O2, providing further evidence that their gene products may be involved in the response to oxidative stress. In addition, after the induction by H2O2 and compared with the wild-type, the gltB expression in \u0394gltC and the gltC expression in \u0394gltB were down-regulated about 4-fold (p<0.05) and 3-fold (p<0.05) respectively. These data demonstrate a possible mutual regulation between gltB and gltC expressions under oxidative stress conditions, partly explaining the similar oxidative stress responses of \u0394gltB and \u0394gltC. Furthermore, \u0394gltB and \u0394gltC exhibited decreased adherence to a glass surface compared to the wild-type, while the cell motility of wild-type and mutant strains was similar. It is hypothesized that some cell surface characteristics unrelated with cell motility may be introduced into the mutants by the inactivation of gltB or gltC, which might lead to the reduction in biofilm formation. We conclude that both gltB and gltC are involved in the biofilm formation as well as the oxidative stress tolerance in L. monocytogenes 4b G, by pathways that remain yet unclear.",

To understand the mechanism of stress response in these serotypes, six strains of each serotype were selected in this study to differentiate the physiological and genetic response of these  L.\u00a0monocytogenes  under oxidative stress. Oxidative stress tolerance was examined by plate count after hydrogen peroxide exposure during exponential phase, long-term-survival phase and biofilm state. The biofilm forming capability of the two serotypes was also compared using crystal violet assay. Three oxidation resistance genes ( kat, sod  and  fri ), two stress-regulator encoding genes ( sigB  and  perR ), and one DNA repair gene ( recA ) were selected for transcription analysis by quantitative RT-PCR. Most serotype 4b strains exhibited a stronger resistance to 0.6% H 2 O 2  than serotype 1/2a during exponential phase and long-term-survival phase, while the latter demonstrated stronger biofilm forming capacity in BHI broth at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. At the genetic level, there were significant differences in the expression of three genes ( sod ,  fri  and  perR ) under oxidative stress between two serotypes, which suggests a role in the observed variation towards stress resistance. In addition, the expression of  recA  was induced under oxidative stress in  L.\u00a0monocytogenes  strains of both serotypes.",

To investigate the mechanism controlling biofilm formation in the food-borne pathogen L. monocytogenes, we characterized LM-49, a mutant with enhanced ability of biofilm formation generated via transposon Tn917 mutagenesis of L. monocytogenes 4b G. In this mutant, a Tn917 insertion has disrupted the coding region of the gene encoding a putative ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter permease identical to Lmof2365_1771 (a putative ABC transporter permease) presented in the sequenced strain L. monocytogenes strain 4b F2365. This disrupted gene, denoted lm.G_1771, encoded a protein with 10 transmembrane helices. The revertant, LM-49RE, was obtained by replacing lm.G_1771::Tn917 with lm.G_1771 via homologous recombination. We found that LM-49RE formed the same amount of biofilm biomass as the wild-type strain. Furthermore, transcription of the downstream lm.G_1770 gene was not influenced by the upstream Tn917 insertion, and the presence of Tn917 has no effect on biofilm formation. These results suggest that lm.G_1771 was solely responsible for the negative regulation of biofilm formation by L. monocytogenes 4b G. The immediate gene upstream of lm.G_1771 encoded an ATP-binding protein. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that these two genes were organized into an operon and that their proteins formed an export ABC transporter. Here, we report the characterization of the mutant and identification of a novel ABC transporter that functions in negative regulation of biofilm formation in L. monocytogenes.",

        "abstract": "Nanomaterials have been widely reported to affect the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, many studies in which these effects were observed were not comprehensive, and many of the proposed mechanisms have been primarily speculative. In this work, we used amino-modified silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles (ASMNPs, which can be collected very easily using an external magnetic field) as a model and compared them with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs, which have been studied extensively) to reveal the mechanisms by which nanoparticles affect PCR. We found that nanoparticles affect PCR primarily by binding to PCR components: (1) inhibition, (2) specifity, and (3) efficiency and yield of PCR are impacted. (1) Excess nanomaterials inhibit PCR by adsorbing to DNA polymerase, Mg2+, oligonucleotide primers, or DNA templates. Nanoparticle surface-active groups are particularly important to this effect.

Materials u0026 methods: Phenotype observation, PCR assay targeting a hypothetical nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene, phylogenetic analysis of rpoB and multilocus sequence typing were used to screen and identify strains of S. argenteus from 839 presumptive S. aureus isolates. Results: Eighty-nine (89/839, 10.6%) of the presumptive S. aureus isolates produced white colonies on tryptone soya agar plates. Of the white-colony isolates, six (6/89, 7%) were S. argenteus, 75 (75/89, 84%) were S. aureus and eight (8/89, 9%) were other bacteria. Conclusion: The PCR-based method targeting the NRPS gene can simultaneously identify and distinguish S. argenteus and S. aureus. All representative sequences of rpoB generated in this study were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers SJTU F20002, KT767581; SJTU F20269, KT767582; SJTU F20419, KT767583; SJTU F20420, KT767584; ...",

We aimed to clone the full-length cDNA of LCYE gene from Chlorella protothecoides CS-41, to predict the functional sites and the three-dimensional structure of LCYE through bioinformatics analysis and to confirm its activities and functions.We used RACE (rapid-amplification of cDNA ends) essay and RT-PCR for the cloning of the full-length cDNA of LCYE from C. protothecoides CS-41. The online software such as PredictProtein, Pfam HMMs and Swiss-Model were used in bioinformatics analysis of the amino acid sequence of LCYE protein. We constructed the expression vector for LCYE gene with pET-28a(+) and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Furthermore, the E. coli strain containing the pAC-LYC plasmid which could accumulate lycopene was used for the functional confirmation of LCYE from C. protothecoides CS-41.A 2107 bp cDNA (GenBank Accession No. FJ752528) sequence was cloned with 1731 bp open reading frame, encoding a putative LCYE, from C. protothecoides CS-41. Homology studies showed that the deduced amino acid sequence of LCYE gene had a significant similarity with the corresponding sequences of other green algae and higher plants. It shared the highest sequence identity, up to 67%, with the LCYE gene from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. One typical lycopene cyclase protein domain (Pfam05834) was predicted between the 48th-459th amino acid. In addition, the sequence between 261th -284th was one typical conserved lycopene cyclase protein motif. The SDS-PAGE result showed that the LCYE gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) after the addition of IPTG. The prokaryotically expressed LCYE protein was able to transfer the color of the E. coli strain containing the pAC-LYC plasmid from pink to yellow.The full-length cDNA sequence of LCYE gene was successfully cloned with the size of 2107 bp. Several typical motifs were found and the three-dimensional structure of LCYE was constructed from Bioinformatics analysis. The generated phylogenetic tree showed the closest relationship between C. protothecoides CS-41 and C. reinhardtii among the listed organisms. Finally, the expression product of the LCYE gene cloned in the study was confirmed to hold the function and activity of lycopene epsilon cyclase.",

The unicellular microalga, Chlorella protothecoides CS-41, had been selected for the heterotrophic production of high concentrations of lutein. In this study, a cDNA copy of the pds gene from C. protothecoides was obtained using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique. Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed that the phytoene desaturases derived from the algal family. Expression of the pds gene in Escherichia coli produced a single protein of 61 kDa. The PDS activity of the expressed protein was confirmed by the production of \u03b6-carotene as the result from the action of the enzyme's desaturation activity, which was identified by high-performance liquid chromatography and heterologous complementation analysis. Using random and site-directed mutagenesis, a single amino acid mutation (N144D) was identified and confirmed. This mutant encodes an inactive enzyme, which implies that amino acid 144 is crutial to the activity of the PDS enzyme. Therefore, by gene cloning and expression in prokaryotic cells, the gene for \u03b6-carotene production or as part of the biosynthetic pathway of lutein had been characterized from Chlorella protothecoides CS-41.",

Current methods for pathogen detection have limitations in the effectiveness of identifying multiple foodborne pathogens. In this study, a pathogen detection microarray was developed using various 70-mer oligonucleotides specifically targeting the above pathogens. To reduce the cost of detection, each microarray chip was designed and fabricated to accommodate 12 identical arrays which could be used for screening up to 12 different samples. To achieve high detection sensitivity and specificity, target-specific DNA amplification instead of whole genome random amplification was used prior to microarray analysis. Combined with 14-plex PCR amplification of target sequences, the microarray unambiguously distinguished all 4 pathogens with a detection sensitivity of 1 x 10(-4) ng (approximately 20 copies) of each genomic DNA. Applied the assay to 39 fresh meat samples, 16 samples were found to be contaminated by either 1 or 2 of these pathogens. The co-occurrences of Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella and L. monocytogenes in the same meat samples were also observed. Overall, the microarray combined with multiplex PCR method was able to effectively screen single or multiple pathogens in food samples and to provide important genotypic information related to pathogen virulence.",

The thermogenic curves of S. aureus in the presence of nisin were studied by an LKB-2277 Thermal Activity Monitor. The thermokinetic parameters, such as the growth rate constant (k), the generation times (G), the inhibitory ratio (I), and the half inhibitory concentration (IC50), for the growth of S. aureus at different nisin concentrations were determined. The relationship between the growth rate constant (k) and the concentration of nisin (c) is nearly linear, which can be modeled by the formula k = 0.03794 - 4.005 x 10(-4) x c, with a correlation coefficient of -0.9971. Based on this model, we obtained the critical inhibitory concentration of nisin on the growth of S. aureus at 94.73 IU/mL. We proposed that this microcalorimetric method could be a useful tool in monitoring the biological effect of nisin on microorganisms, and providing valuable information on the study of microorganism metabolisms.",

In this study, the carotenoids in Chlorella pyrenoidosa heterotrophi- cally cultivated in a 19-litre fermentor have been analyzed and determined by using HPLC and HPLC-MS. A biochemical system theory (BST) model was developed for understand- ing the regulatory features of carotenoid metabolism during the batch cultivation. Factors that influence lutein production by C. pyrenoidosa were discussed based on the model. It shows that low flux for lycopene formation is the major bottleneck for lutein production, while by-product syntheses and inhibitions affect the cellular lutein content much less. How- ever, with further increase of the cellular lutein content, the inhibition on lycopene forma- tion by lutein may become a limiting factor. Although speculative, these results may pro- vide useful information for further elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms of carotenoid biosynthesis in Chlorella and modifying its metabolic network to enhance lutein produc- tion.",

        "abstract": "The risk of zoonotic transmission to humans highlights the need to understand the molecular ecology of Staphylococcus aureus in foods. In this study, 142 S. aureus isolates obtained from various raw and processed foods from Shanghai, China were characterized to determine their genetic diversity and virulence gene content. A total of 16 clonal complexes (CCs), 34 staphylococcal protein A (spa) types, and 6 accessory gene regulator (agr) allelic groups were identified and analyzed among the 142 S. aureus isolates. Among these, the genotype CC188-t189-agr \u0399 was the most prevalent, constituting 28.2% of all isolates. The presence of virulence genes encoding 20 staphylococcal enterotoxins (se), toxic shock syndrome toxin (tsst1), exfoliative toxins (eta, etb, and etd), Panton-Valentine leukocidin (lukS-PV and lukF-PV), as well as methicillin resistance gene (mecA), was determined by PCR. Of these S. aureus isolates, 72.5% harbored toxin genes, in which the most frequent toxin gene was sep (43.7%), followed by sej (26.1%) and pvl (21.1%). In contrast, see, ses, set, tsst1, etb, and etd were not found in any of the isolates tested. Eight S. aureus isolates (5.6%, 8/142), seven from raw milk and one from frozen food, were mecA positive and resistant to oxacillin, thus were MRSA. The 142 S. aureus isolates displayed 52 different toxin gene profiles. Although no direct association was found between toxin gene profile and the S. aureus genotype, the isolates belonging to CC5, CC9, CC20, CC50, and CC72 clonal lineages in general carried more toxin genes (&amp;gt;5) compared with the isolates in other CCs. It was also revealed that raw milk and raw meat were the major sources of isolates containing multiple toxin genes. S. aureus isolates from food that were genetically highly related, displayed diverse toxin gene profiles, implying the significant role of horizontal gene transfer in the emergence of highly toxigenic S. aureus isolates.",

        "abstract": "Phytoene synthase (PSY) catalyzes the condensation of two molecules of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to form phytoene, the first colorless carotene in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway. So it is regarded as the crucial enzyme for carotenoid production, and has unsurprisingly been involved in genetic engineering studies of carotenoid production. In this study, the psy gene from Chlorella protothecoides CS-41, designated Cppsy, was cloned using rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The full-length DNA was 2488 bp, and the corresponding cDNA was 1143 bp, which encoded 380 amino acids. Computational analysis suggested that this protein belongs to the Isoprenoid_Biosyn_C1 superfamily. It contained the consensus sequence, including three predicted substrate-Mg(2+) binding sites. The Cppsy gene promoter was also cloned and characterized. Analysis revealed several candidate motifs for the promoter, which exhibited light- and methyl jasmonate (MeJA)-responsive characteristics, as well as some typical domains universally discovered in promoter sequences, such as the TATA-box and CAAT-box. Light- and MeJA treatment showed that the Cppsy expression level was significantly enhanced by light and MeJA. These results provide a basis for genetically modifying the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway in C. protothecoides.",

        "abstract": "Staphylococcus argenteus and S. schweitzeri, were recently proposed as novel species within S. aureus complex (SAC). S. argenteus has been reported in many countries and can threaten human health. S. schweitzeri has not been associated with human infections, but has been isolated from non-human primates. Questions regarding the evolution of pathogenicity of these two species will remain elusive until an exploratory evolutionary framework is established.We present genomic comparison analysis among members of SAC based on a pan-genome definition, which included 15 S. argenteus genomes (five newly sequenced), six S. schweitzeri genomes and 30 divergent S. aureus genomes. The three species had divergent core genomes and rare interspecific recombination was observed among the core genes. However, some subtypes of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) elements and prophages were present in different species. Of 111 tested virulence genes of S. aureus, 85 and 86 homologous genes were found in S. argenteus and S. schweitzeri, respectively. There was no difference in virulence gene content among the three species, but the sequence of most core virulence genes was divergent. Analysis of the agr locus and the genes in the capsular polysaccharides biosynthetic operon revealed that they both diverged before the speciation of SAC members. Furthermore, the widespread geographic distribution of S. argenteus, sequence type 2250, showed ambiguous biogeographical structure among geographically isolated populations, demonstrating an international spread of this pathogen.S. argenteus has spread among several countries, and invasive infections and persistent carriage may be not limited to currently reported regions. S. argenteus probably had undergone a recent host adaption and can cause human infections with a similar pathogenic potential.",

        "abstract": "Salmonella is the most common cause of bacterial food poisoning in humans worldwide. Thus, rapid and reliable methods for the detection of this pathogen are required. Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-RT-PCR), which detects the presence of mRNA (shorter half-life than DNA) has shown great potential for detecting viable pathogens. We recently identified a few new potential specific DNA sequences for Salmonella enterica using a comparative genomics method (Chen et al., 2010). In the present study, we examined the expression of the Salmonella-specific sigDE operon (encoding invasion proteins within the pathogenicity island 5) under typical growth conditions to determine whether sigDE could be a useful viability marker for the bacterium. We then assayed sigDE mRNA from cells heat-treated at 60\u00b0C, 100\u00b0C, and 121\u00b0C (autoclaved), and found that mRNA was degraded in autoclaved bacterial samples. These results showed that the sigDE transcript is a suitable mRNA target for rt-RT-PCR with samples pretreated at 121\u00b0C. Thus, an rt-RT-PCR using sigDE primers was developed for the detection of viable Salmonella. An RNA internal amplification control was constructed by overlap extension PCR, synthesized using in vitro transcription with a T7 RNA polymerase promoter, and incorporated into the rt-RT-PCR system to eliminate false-negative results. The rt-RT-PCR system has the capability of specifically detecting all the tested S. enterica serovars, and the detection limit of this assay with cultures of Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 13311 was 10(1) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. After 18-h enrichment, sigDE-based rt-RT-PCR could detect as low as 10(0) CFU/mL of Salmonella from egg broth and milk.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the study was to explore new detective targets for Enterococcus spp.,with better performance in specificity and sensitivity,and subsequently to develop a real-time PCR method which could be effectively applied to rapid quantitative detection of enterococci.Genomic comparative analysis among Enterococcus and non-Entercoccus strains was conducted to screen the specific targets for enterococci,and 42 target fragments were selected for the design of 50 primer pairs.Their specificity and sensitivity were then evaluated by regular PCR and real-time PCR,respectively.Finally,the method was effectively evaluated while it was used in the detection of food samples.Analysis results showed that primer EF1902 was confirmed as the best primer due to its high specificity and sensitivity in real-time PCR tests.The results showed a specific amplification from 44 Enterococcus strains,whereas no amplification from 23 non-Enterococcus strains.A detection limit of 13.78 copies/PCR for purified genomic DNA and 38.4 cfu/PCR for bacterial cultures could be achieved after PCR parameter optimization.Artificial contamination assays showed that Enterococcus could be detected by real-time PCR after 6 h enrichment,with an initial spike of 2.63 cfu/mL bacterium in milk samples.The real-time PCR method developed in this study was also applied to detect various food samples,and the positive rate of detection was 57.69%.The accuracy was 94.23% compared with the conventional standard method,which demonstrates its potential for practical application.In conclusion,the real-time PCR system developed in this study was suitable for the rapid detection of Enterococcus spp.in foods for its advantages in specificity,sensitivity,rapidness and accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are major contributors to acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis outbreaks. Many aspects of HuNoVs are poorly understood due to both the current inability to culture HuNoVs, and the lack of efficient small animal models. Surrogates for HuNoVs, such as recombinant viral like particles (VLPs) expressed in eukaryotic system or P particles expressed in prokaryotic system, have been used for studies in immunology and interaction between the virus and its receptors. However, it is difficult to use VLPs or P particles to collect or isolate potential ligands binding to these recombinant capsid proteins. In this study, a new strategy was used to collect HuNoVs binding ligands through the use of ice nucleation protein (INP) to display recombinant capsid proteins of HuNoVs on bacterial surfaces. The viral protein-ligand complex could be easily separated by a low speed centrifugation step. This system was also used to explore interaction between recombinant capsid proteins of HuNoVs and their receptors. In this system, the VP1 capsid encoding gene (ORF2) and the protruding domain (P domain) encoding gene (3' terminal fragment of ORF2) of HuNoVs GI.1 and GII.4 were fused with 5' terminal fragment of INP encoding gene (inaQn). The results demonstrated that the recombinant VP1 and P domains of HuNoVs were expressed and anchored on the surface of Escherichia coli BL21 cells after the bacteria were transformed with the corresponding plasmids. Both cell surface displayed VP1 and P domains could be recognized by HuNoVs specific antibodies and interact with the viral histo-blood group antigens receptors. In both cases, displayed P domains had better binding abilities than VP1. This new strategy of using displayed HuNoVs capsid proteins on the bacterial surface could be utilized to separate HuNoVs binding components from complex samples, to investigate interaction between the virus and its receptors, as well as to develop an oral vaccine for HuNoVs.",

In this study, the disk diffusion method and epsilometer test were performed to determine the prevalence of ARSA in 78 foodborne isolates using 18 antibiotics. The highest resistance frequency was found for penicillin G (74.4%), followed by erythromycin (59.0%) and clindamycin (44.9%), whereas no vancomycin-resistant isolates were found. The 78 isolates could be subtyped into 31 resistance profiles and 11 clusters based on their antimicrobial susceptibility. Furthermore, Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening for the presence of 13 genes conferring antibiotic resistance was conducted. The presence of resistance genes was relatively high: blaTEM (80.8%), ermB (41.0%), grlA (38.5%), ermC (35.9%), and aac6'/aph2\" (35.9%).

        "abstract": "Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a major cause of foodborne illness and methods for rapid and sensitive detection of this deadly pathogen are needed to protect consumers. The use of immunomagnetic separation (IMS) for capturing and detecting foodborne pathogens has gained popularity, partially due to the introduction of automated and high throughput IMS instrumentation. Three methods for automated IMS that test different sample volumes, Kingfisher mL, Pathatrix Auto, and Pathatrix Ultra, were compared using microbiological detection of E. coli O157:H7 from buffered peptone water (BPW), in the presence of background microbial flora derived from spinach leaves, and from culture enrichments from artificially contaminated spinach leaves. The average efficiencies of capture of E. coli O157:H7 using the three methods were 32.1%, 3.7%, and 1.3%, respectively, in BPW; 43.4%, 8.8%, 2.9%, respectively, in the presence of spinach microbial flora; and 63.0%, 7.0%, and 6.3%, respectively, from artificially contaminated spinach. Despite the large differences in IMS capture efficiencies between the KingFisher and two Pathatrix methods, all three methods allowed the detection of E. coli O157:H7 from spinach that was artificially contaminated with the pathogen at relatively high (25 cfu/30 g sample) and low (1 cfu/30 g sample) levels after 4-6h of culture enrichment. The differences in capture efficiency were compensated for by the differences in sample volume used by the KingFisher mL (1 mL), Pathatrix Auto (50 mL) and Pathatrix Ultra (250 mL) instruments. Thus, despite the reduced capture efficiencies observed for the Pathatrix methods, the large increase in sample volume results in a greater number of captured cells for downstream detection resulting in improved detection sensitivity.",

Twenty-nine sequence types (STs) and 63 PFGE patterns were identified, and results from the 2 subtyping methods correlated well. The 12 isolates of PFGE cluster B all belonged to ST-2332 and were associated with nosocomial neonatal diarrhea. Isolates of a cluster usually had the same set of virulence factors, whereas isolates of different PFGE clusters carried diverse combinations of virulence determinants. Isolates belonging to ST-2332 and ST-182 (n=9) were resistant to at least 6 antimicrobials. Our findings highlighted the need of active surveillance programs for infectious diseases collecting data at both epidemiological and genetic levels that can detect high-risk lineages of pathogens in order to rapidly identify disease outbreaks.",

        "abstract": "The effects of six culture parameters including inocula, aeration, initial concentrations of glucose, KNO3, KH2PO4 and MgSO4 on both the heterotrophic growth of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and lutein production were investigated based on flask experiments. Mathematic models were developed by means of uniform design to describe the effects of four medium components on cell growth and cellular lutein content. It was found that lower medium volume or higher agitation rate in flask experiments favored both cell growth and lutein formation, which means that sufficient aeration is the necessity. In the range between 10~60 g\u00b7L-1, higher initial concentration of glucose resulted in higher final biomass concentration and lutein yield, but inhibited the cell growth. In the range between 2\u22361~12\u22361, lower C\u2236N ratio increased cellular lutein content but had less effects on the cell growth. Significant elevations of the specific growth rate of Chlorella and cellular lutein content were obtained by model-based optimization. The highest specific growth rate and cellular lutein content attained as 2.32 d-1 and 3.18 mg\u00b7L-1, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Campylobacter is a major cause of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. Young children represent a particular age group affected by Campylobacter infection because of their limited diets and weak immune systems.In this study, a total of 110 Campylobacter (80 C. jejuni and 30 C. coli) isolated from children younger than 5 years of age with diarrhea in Shanghai, China in 2011 were examined for their genetic relationship and antimicrobial susceptibility. The presence of virulence genes and its association with invasion potential in Caco-2 cell were also determined.Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) revealed 62 sequence types (STs) under 14 clonal complexes from C. jejuni and 15 STs under 2 clonal complexes from C. coli. High resistance rates among the 110 isolates were observed to nalidixic acid (88.2%), ciprofloxacin (87.3%) and tetracycline (87.3%), followed by ampicillin (30.9%), gentamicin (28.2%), clindamycin (21.8%), erythromycin (21.8%), and chloramphenicol (8.2%). Compared with that of C. jejuni (32.5%), a larger proportion of C. coli (83.3%) were resistant to multiple antimicrobials, including 16 isolates of ST-828 complex resistant to six antimicrobials: ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, and tetracycline. Furthermore, 57 Campylobacter isolates were selected based on their distinct STs and the presence of virulence genes to determine their abilities to adhere to and invade Caco-2 cells. The level of invasion varied widely among isolates, and had relatively weak correlation with the genotype data.Our findings provided baseline data on Campylobacter among young children. Active surveillance of Campylobacter is needed to better understand the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance trends of this significant pathogen to help control and protect young children from such infections.",

In this study, an outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis involving 112 cases in Ningbo, China was investigated with a combination of genotypic subtyping methods and phenotypic analysis. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis profiles showed that most of the outbreak clinical isolates (22/23) were indistinguishable from each other and were identical to the isolates obtained from implicated mousse cakes, demonstrating that this outbreak of gastroenteritis was caused by Salmonella Enteritidis-contaminated mousse cakes. Moreover, all isolates, irrespective of source, had an identical antibiotic susceptibility pattern. Five virulence-associated genes in Salmonella pathogenicity islands and the plasmid-associated virulence genes spvB/C were present in both the food and clinical isolates. Importantly, all of these isolates can survive well under low-temperature treatment, indicating that manufacturers of foodstuffs with raw ingredients (not subjected to thermal processing) should use an effective approach to prevent or eliminate the microbial hazards to public health.",

The top 10 serotypes would include 20 serotypes all belonged to A-F groups, while S. Pomona was next to S. Wandsworth, according to the non- A-F groups. Young children seemed to be susceptible to S. Pomona, and might cause bloody stools and super-infection. The top 10 serotypes from 1 805 foodborne Salmonella strains were significantly more extensive than those from the human S. Pomona strains, followed by those rare serotypes which were mostly isolated from turtle, sea-shellfish and reptiles. Antibiotic resistance of S. Pomona strains from other sources were significantly more severe than those from human samples, and belonged to A and B clones by means of PFGE. Clone A strains were non-epidemic strains which showed multi-drug resistance (MDR) to antimicrobials. Clone B was the main epidemic-causing strain that not resistant to drugs, which consisting B- I from young-age-groups and B-II were from the seniors. B-I strains were homologous to those from shellfish, tortoises and lizards, while B-II strains only showing homology to those from shellfish. One S. Pomona strain-MDR, isolated from human was homologous to 8 antimicrobials.S. Pomona was a quite common serotype among those rare serotypes, which showed higher pathogenicity to infants while genetic evolution might take place when comparing them with the strains isolated from the clinics in 2005. Surveillance programs should be intensified along with the early warnings systems on infections which were from seafood and reptiles.",

The influence of pH value of zymotic substance from L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus also significantly affected this inhibitory activity to L. monocytogenes. Meanwhile, the inhibitory effects of lactic acid, hydrochloric acid and acetic acid with different concentrations on L. monocytogenes were studied to understand the role of these acids in the inhibitory effects. The inhibitory effect of lactobacillus metabolic products such as lactic acid and acetic acid on L. monocytogenes was more obvious than that of hydrochloric acid. Acetic acid showed the strongest inhibitory effect and the inhibitory effect increased along with the incresease of acid concentrations.",

Monitoring their kinetics in the chain of seafood production, processing and consumption is of great importance for food and mariculture safety. In order to enrich Vibrio-representing 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) fragments and identify these bacteria further real-timely and synchronously among bacterial flora in the chain, a pair of primers that selectively amplify Vibrio 16S rDNA fragments were designed with their specificities and coverage testified in the analysis of seawater Vibrio community. The specificities and coverage of two primers, VF169 and VR744, were determined theoretically among bacterial 16S rDNAs available in GenBank by using BLAST program and practically by amplifying Vibrio 16S rDNA fragments from seawater DNA. More than 88.3% of sequences in GenBank, which showed identical matches with VR744, belong to Vibrio genus. A total of 33 clones were randomly selected and sequenced. All of the sequences showed their highest similarities to and clustered around those of diverse known Vibrio species. The primers designed are capable of retrieving a wide range of Vibrio 16S rDNA fragments specifically among bacterial flora in seawater, the most important natural environment of seafood cultivation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Microwave heat/moisture treatment (MWT) is being used increasingly in food processing, but very little research has been carried out on its effect on tuber starches. In this study, Canna edulis Ker tuber starch was subjected to MWT with moisture contents ranging from 20 to 45% (w/w), and the effects of MWT on the physicochemical properties of the starch, including the extent of amylose leaching, enzymatic digestibility, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) characteristics, were determined. RESULTS: In the process of MWT, temperature exhibited a positive correlation with microwave power and moisture content. When amylose leaching was used as an index, a moisture content of 40%, a treatment time of 15 min and a microwave power of 800 W were found to be the optimal conditions for MWT of C. edulis starch. The enzymatic digestibility changed under different treatment conditions. Furthermore, XRD measurements revealed a change in crystalline structure from type B to type A and an increased degree of crystallinity. Thermal (DSC) studies showed higher values of To, Tp and Tc of endothermic peaks, and exothermic peaks were also observed. CONCLUSION: MWT increased the degree of crystallinity, resulting in more resistant fractions in C. edulis starch, which will be beneficial to human health. \u00a9 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Lutein in Chlorella pyrenoidosa cells was extracted by mixed solvents of methanol-dichloromethane (2:1, v/v). The HPLC method was performed on a Nova-Pak~(?) C_(18) stainless steel column (4.6 mm i.d.\u00d7150mm, 5\u03bcm) at 25\u2103 by employing methanol-acetonitrile-water (80:10:10, v/v/v) and methanol-acetonitrile (40:60, v/v) as the mobile phase, applying gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. Lutein was detected by a diode array detector (DAD) at 447 nm. The relative standard deviation of the results was 0.49\uff05(n=6), and the average recovery was 99.73\uff05. The calibration curve for lutein gave good linearity over a wide range of 0\uff5e60 mg/L (r=0.999 9), and the retention time was 11.25 min. The result showed that this method is simple, rapid and accurate.",

Then, the amylose of Canna edulis Ker. was extracted with the method of hot alkaline, and purified through n-butanol and isoamyl alcohol crystallization again and again. At last, absorption spectrum of iodin-amylose compound was scanned from 500 to 800 nm using UV spectrometer. The amylose content was determined by the method of hot alkaline and Fehling Reagent and iodine combined content of the amylose was determined by electrometric titration. The result showed that maximum absorption spectrum of the iodin-amylose compound locates at 600 nm and the values of content and Iodine combined content of the amylose obtained are 87.14% and 10.4, respectively. In addition, the content of amylose in the Canna edulis Ker. starch is further determined as 77.94% through standard curve using the obtained amylose starch and amylopectin starch of corn as standards. This study can make a contribution to basic study of Canna edulis Ker. starch at molecular level.",

The hyperlipidemia models of ICR mice were established by feeding high-fat feed,and the contents of the total cholesterol(TC),triglycerides(TG)and HDL-cholesterol in mice serum were determined after 60 days. It was demonstrated from this study that the contents of TC were 98.14 mg/dL and 86.07 mg/dL in SE and SM groups,decreased by 17.3% and 27.5%,TG contents were 153.54 mg/dL and 118.98 mg/dL,decreased by 28.4% and 44.5%,and HDL-C contents were 73.89 mg/dL and 70.01 mg/dL,increased by 34.4% and 27.3%,compared with the hyperlipidemia model group,respectively. The contents of TC and TG in both SE and SM groups were lowered significantly(P<0.05),however,the contents of HDL-C increased significantly(P<0.05). Therefore,it can be concluded that both Luo Han Guo Juice Concentrate and Luo Han Guo Mogrosides have the function of modulating the metabolism of blood fat.",

We present features of the two  strains and case details of their pathogenicity, explore factors that induce  SCVs formation in the course of anti-infection therapy, and reveal potential genetic mechanisms for  SCVs formation.  strains were identified using phenotypic and genotypic methods.

The genomes of both strains were sequenced and aligned in a pair-wise fashion using Mauve. The case details gave us important insights on the characteristics and therapeutic strategies for infections caused by  and its SCVs. We found that strain XNO62 and SCV strain XNO106 are genetically-related sequential clones, the SCV strain exhibits reduced virulence but enhanced intracellular persistence compared to strain XNO62, thus promoting persistent infection. The induction experiments for  SCVs demonstrated that high concentrations of amikacin greatly induce  XNO62 to form SCVs, while a chronic infection of  XNO62 slightly induces SCVs formation. Potential genetic mechanisms for  SCVs formation were revealed and discussed based on genomic alignments. In conclusion, we report the first case of infection caused by  and its SCVs strain. More attention should be paid to infections caused by  and its SCVs, as they constitute a challenge to current therapeutic strategies.

        "abstract": "Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen that causes listeriosis. Paraquat can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells, which results in oxidative stress. It was first shown that 1 mM of paraquat inhibited the growth rate of a superoxide dismutase (sod)-deletion mutant (\u2206sod) generated from L. monocytogenes 4b G but not in the wild-type, and induced the expression of other resistance genes (kat, fri, perR, sigB, and recA) as well as sod in the wild type. Interestingly, without paraquat treatment the expression of all the 5 genes were repressed in \u2206sod compared to the wild type, while the expression of recA triggering SOS response, a global response to DNA damage, was increased in \u2206sod in the presence of 1 mM paraquat. Taken together, these results suggest that SOD plays a central role in oxidant defense of L. monocytogenes 4b G, and SOS probably significantly impacts \u2206sod survival under oxidative stress.",

They have been of considerable interest in food hygiene since biofilms may contain spoilage and pathogenic bacteria which increases post-processing contamination and risk to public health. In addition, biofilm cells are more resistant to cleaning and disinfection processes in the food industry. Biofilm formation is a complex process in which genetic mechanisms and numerous factors such as the properties of substratum and bacterial cell surfaces are involved. In order to further understand the intricate mechanisms behind biofilm formation, various techniques including physical, chemical and molecular methods have been used to establish the possible model of biofilm formation in food industry. Therefore, the importance of bacterial biofilms in food safety control and biofilm formation mechanisms will be discussed in this paper. The objective of all efforts is to provide new insights for developing biofilm-free food-processing systems.",

        "abstract": "The effects of nitrate, ammonium, and urea as nitrogen sources on the heterotrophic growth of Chlorella protothecoides were investigated using flask cultures. No appreciable inhibitory effect on the algal growth was observed over a nitrogen concentration range of 0.85\u20131.7 g l \u2212 1 . In contrast, differences in specific growth rate and biomass production were found among the cultures with the various nitrogen compounds. The influence of different nitrogen sources at a concentration equivalent to 1.7 g l \u2212 1 nitrogen on the heterotrophic production of biomass and lutein by C. protothecoides was investigated using the culture medium containing 40 g l \u2212 1 glucose as the sole carbon and energy source in fermentors. The maximum biomass concentrations in the three cultures with nitrate, ammonium, and urea were 18.4, 18.9, and 19.6 g l \u2212 1 dry cells, respectively. The maximum lutein yields in these cultures were between 68.42 and 83.81 mg l \u2212 1 . The highest yields of both biomass and lutein were achieved in the culture with urea. It was therefore concluded that urea was the best nitrogen source for the production of biomass and lutein. Based on the experimental results, a group of kinetic models describing cell growth, lutein production, and glucose and nitrogen consumption were proposed and a satisfactory fit was found between the experimental results and predicted values. Dynamic analysis of models demonstrated that enhancing initial nitrogen concentration in fermentor cultures, which correspondingly enhances cell growth and lutein formation, may shorten the fermentation cycle by 25\u201346%.",

Flask cultures with initial pH 5.0-8.0 were carried out, and it was found that pH 6.0 was optimal for the algal growth. Further tests in fermentors showed that the highest biomass concentration, maximum cellular lutein content and lutein yield were achieved at pH 6. 6. In addition, it was shown that optimal biomass concentration and lutein yield were obtained at 28 degrees C, while application of 35 degrees C resulted in the highest cellular lutein content. A mathematical model was developed for the description of the processes under these cultivation conditions and the kinetic model fitted well to the experimental data. The obtained results may contribute to the commercial production of lutein by C. protothecoides.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to develop a reliable hybrid neural network (HNN) model for heterotrophic growth of Chlorella, based on which optimization for fed-batch (FB) cultivation of Chlorella may be successfully realized.Deterministic kinetic model was preliminarily developed for the optimization of FB cultivation of Chlorella. The highest biomass concentration and the maximum productivity were obtained as: 104.9 g l(-1) dry cell weight and 0.613 g l(-1) h(-1), respectively. After several cultivations had been performed, an HNN model was developed. The efficiency of biomass production was further increased by the optimization using this model. The highest biomass concentration and the maximum productivity attained was: 116.2 g l(-1) dry cell weight and 1.020 g l(-1) h(-1), respectively.The HNN model agreed well with experimental results in different cultivations. Comparison between the HNN model and the deterministic model showed that the former had better generalization ability, which made it a reliable tool in modelling and optimization.The high cell density and productivity of biomass obtained in this study is of significance for the commercial cultivation of Chlorella. The simple and efficient optimization strategy proposed in this paper may be employed in heterotrophic mass culture of Chlorella as well as other similar organisms.",

        "abstract": "Proanthocyanidins are flavonoids that are widely present in the skin and seeds of various plants, with the highest content in grape seeds. Many experiments have shown that proanthocyanidins have antitumor activity both in vivo and in vitro. Autophagy and apoptosis of tumor cells induced by drugs are two of the major causes of tumor cell death. However, reports on the effect of autophagy induced by drugs in tumor cells are not consistent and suggest that autophagy can have synergistic or antagonistic effects with apoptosis. This research was aimed at investigating whether proanthocyanidins induced autophagy and apoptosis in human gastric cancer cell line MGC-803 cells and to identify the mechanism of proanthocyanidins action to further determine the effect of proanthocyanidins-induced autophagy on apoptosis. MTT assay was used to examine the proanthocyanidin cytotoxicity against human gastric cancer cell line MGC-803. Transmission electron microscopy and monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining were used to detect autophagy. Annexin V APC/7-AAD double staining and Hoechst 33342/propidium iodide (PI) double staining were used to explore apoptosis. Western blotting was used to determine expression of proteins related to autophagy and apoptosis. Real-time quantitative PCR technology was used to determine the mRNA level of Beclin1 and BCL-2. The results showed that proanthocyanidins exhibit a significant inhibitory effect on the human gastric cancer cell line MGC-803 proliferation in vitro and simultaneously activate autophagy and apoptosis to promote cell death. Furthermore, when proanthocyanidin-induced autophagy is inhibited, apoptosis increases significantly, proanthocyanidins can be used together with autophagy inhibitors to enhance cytotoxicity.",

        "abstract": "Diosgenin, a plant steroid compound from Dioscorea nipponica, is an anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antitumor, vasodilatory compound, which also reduces blood lipid content and protects against ischemia\u2011induced neuronal damage. However, a limited number of studies have been performed on the antitumor effect of diosgenin on prostate cancer, the underlying mechanism of which remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, the effect and underlying mechanism of diosgenin on DU145 human prostate cancer cells was investigated. DU145 cells were cultured in\u00a0vitro with diosgenin, following which cell proliferation was detected by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. In addition, DU145 cells were observed under a transmission electron microscope to confirm autophagy. monodansylcadaverine staining and western blotting indicated the levels of autophagy in DU145 cells. To determine the mechanism underlying the effect of diosgenin on DU145 cells, western blotting was performed to evaluate the involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. To investigate the association between apoptosis and autophagy, DU145 cells were cultured with diosgenin and 3\u2011methyladenine. Hoechst 33342/propidium iodide double staining was performed to detect apoptosis, and reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze mRNA expression levels of Beclin 1 and B\u2011cell lymphoma 2. Diosgenin inhibits the proliferation of DU145 cells by activating apoptosis and autophagy, and the mechanism underlying this activation may be associated with the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. In\u00a0addition, the inhibition of autophagy mediated by diosgenin increases apoptosis and, thus, increases the therapeutic effect. The combination of diosgenin with an autophagy inhibitor may be an effective strategy to increase the antitumor effect of diosgenin.",

Influence of the positions,lengths and cross-sectional areas of access drifts on transient pressures in the tunnel on high speed railway was studied. Results indicated that locations of access drifts will cause advantageous or disadvantageous influences on the dynamic air pressure waves acting on the train. The most favorable and unfavorable positions of access drifts affecting transient pressures in long tunnels can be determined by the principle of superposition. It has been shown by comparison of pressure wave curves that the lengths of access drifts will not cause obvious effct on transient pressures in the tunnel, while the cross-sectional areas of them are not to be large, otherwise they will cause unfavorable influence.",

        "abstract": "Water quality data is incredibly important and valuable, but its acquisition is not always trivial. A promising solution is to distribute a wireless sensor network in water to measure and collect the data; however, a drawback exists in that the batteries of the system must be replaced or recharged after being exhausted. To mitigate this issue, we designed a self-sustained water quality sensing system that is powered by renewable bioenergy generated from microbial fuel cells (MFCs). MFCs collect the energy released from native magnesium oxidizing microorganisms (MOMs) that are abundant in natural waters. The proposed energy-harvesting technology is environmentally friendly and can provide maintenance-free power to sensors for several years. Despite these benefits, an MFC can only provide microwatt-level power that is not sufficient to continuously power a sensor. To address this issue, we designed a power management module to accumulate energy when the input voltage is as low as 0.33V. We also proposed a radio-frequency (RF) activation technique to remotely activate sensors that otherwise are switched off in default. With this innovative technique, a sensor\u2019s energy consumption in sleep mode can be completely avoided. Additionally, this design can enable on-demand data acquisitions from sensors. We implement the proposed system and evaluate its performance in a stream. In 3-month field experiments, we find the system is able to reliably collect water quality data and is robust to environment changes.\n\n",

The proliferation of industrial and agricultural activities in modern society, however, poses threats to water resources in the form of chemical, biological, and thermal pollution. On the other hand, tremendous advancements in science and technology offer valuable tools to address water sustainability challenges. Key technologies, including sensing technology, wireless communications and networking, hydrodynamic modeling, data analysis, and control, enable intelligently wireless networked water cyber-physical systems (CPS) with embedded sensors, processors, and actuators that can sense and interact with the water environment.

        "abstract": "Aiming at the effect of different length-to-diameter ratio of charge in EFP shaping, the process of a kind of hemispherical EFP shaping is modeled and simulated with ANSYS/LS-DYNA simulation software. The process of EFP shaping and parameters of the processing are studied. The different data of length-to-diameter ratio of charge are obtained by changing the height of charge, and then the process of shaping in different length-to-diameter ratio is simulated to receive the data of velocity, speed growth rate and energy efficiency of different length-to-diameter ratio, which provides the theoretical basis in designing and manufacturing and the damage effect evaluation of EFP. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",
